A 22-year-old Moroccan woman has been arrested after she tried to smuggle a Gabonese migrant into Spain‘s North African enclave of Ceuta hidden inside a suitcase, according to Spanish newspaper El Pais.
El Pais reports that the woman was pushing her luggage cart at the Tarajal border crossing when her nervous body language aroused the suspicions of Spanish Civil Guard officials. They instructed her to open her suitcase, and found the 19-year-old migrant curled up inside.

The migrant was treated by paramedics for oxygen deprivation, and the woman arrested for immigration-related charges.
Such incidents are not uncommon in Ceuta, an autonomous Spanish city that shares a border with Morocco and has long been a magnet for sub-Saharan African migrants looking to enter Europe.
Last year, Global News reported the cases of an 8-year-old Ivorian boy found hiding inside a suitcase, and a Guinean man discovered crammed inside the hood of a car.
At least 800 migrants tried to cross into Ceuta from Morocco on Sunday by storming a border fence, though most were eventually turned back, the Spanish and Moroccan governments said.
In early December more than 400 migrants managed to force their way over the Ceuta border fence.

Prom season in Oakland County is officially kicking off this week, and our photographers will be attending as many prom events as possible to capture the excitement and the unique fashion showcasing students individuality and style as they close out their high school careers.
There are approximately 70 public and private high schools scattered throughout the county, and while we cant attend every prom each year, our goal is to capture as many as we can to help chronicle these special milestone events for students, families and the community as a whole.
Photos taken at each prom will be posted to a gallery later that evening on our media website at media.theoaklandpress.com, so be sure to check there, and on our Facebook page at facebook.com/TheOaklandPress for all our latest prom photo coverage. For safety reasons, we do not identify students individually.

“When I'm done tonight, they are gonna have me headline,” DJ Khaled declared at the top of his Coachella set Saturday night.
That's a rather cocky assertion when you're playing among 150 acts, but the producer/DJ promised the tightly packed crowd in the Sahara (bodies spilled out of the sides with no visible end in sight) that he had the entire music industry waiting in the wings.
And did he deliver? No.
As has become Coachella custom, his set was jammed with special guests. But the problem with that is when you overpromise and overhype your guests.
That's not to say Khaled didn't come armed with surprises.
Rick Ross popped out for a mini-set, as did 2 Chainz. French Montana delivered his verse from the summer anthem “All the Way Up” (which was confounding because Khaled had played the song, like, 40 minutes earlier) before debuting a track with Swae Lee. There was Wale, ASAP Ferg and Migos — who reprised “Bad and Boujee” for what felt like the millionth time that weekend.
Granted these were great surprises, but when you promise your audience you were bringing the entire industry and you drone on about how you're about to kill the evening, expectations are high..
The crowd got gassed with excitement when Khaled paid tribute to Jay-Z with a flurry of songs, thinking it was building to a cameo. It didn't. Same when Drake's “For Free” rang out, as everyone there had seen him with Future (he too was a no-show).
As Khaled stood around his guests or hyped the crowd, it was hard to ignore the fact that he wasn't contributing much at all to his own set. So if you're not actually DJing during your DJ set, then what exactly are you doing?

Senior pitcher Armando Yanez of Birmingham can be found singing whenever there's a country music tune playing on the public address system.
It's gotten to the point that teammates have nicknamed him, "Country lover Mundo."
He lived in Utah until moving back to Southern California this past year. A friend got him listening to country music and now he thinks it's the best.
"When I pull up to practice in my car, country music is jamming," he said.
"He comes out to country music," Coach Matt Mowry said. "My wife loves country music, so she always comes to watch him pitch."
Yanez is 5-2 this season for Birmingham.

The common practice of boarding airline passengers by classes is the worst way to avoid spreading infectious diseases, according to a study from Arizona State University.
The study by a team that included experts in human evolution, biomedical informatics and applied math found that infection rates increased when passengers were crowded together — as they often are while trying to board a plane.
In the case of an Ebola outbreak, the study said that the current boarding practice used by most airlines would lead to a 67% chance of 20 air-travel-related cases a month.
Furthermore, the study found that bigger planes with more passengers can also lead to higher infection rates. In the past decade, the airline industry has tried to increase efficiency and profits by packing more passengers in larger planes
“Using smaller airplanes during an outbreak, instead of completely banning flights to a specific destination, can drastically reduce the probability of introduction of infection,” said Anuj Mubayi, an assistant professor at ASU's School of Human Evolution and Social Change who worked on the study.
The study recommends a few fixes to reduce the infection rate, such as dividing the plane into two lengthwise sections and loading passengers randomly to cut down on bottlenecks.

QUETTA - The stipends of 421 government employees have been stopped in Qilla Abdullah triggering uproar from employees organisations who have decided to stage street protests against the decision.
According to details, the Deputy Commissioner Qilla Abdullah Qaiser Khan Nasar issued a list containing names of 421 government officials from across the district who had been declared either surplus or bogus.
The United Employees Federation of Chaman reviewed list of employees whose salaries had been stopped upon declaring them bogus or surplus either.
The UEF spokesman blamed the inefficiency of education officers who had enlisted too those employees in the list who had retired earlier. The ghost employees are one of the most daunting challenges before the government in Balochistan.
Saskatchewan Roughrider Duron Carter has been released from custody after being arrested at the Saskatoon Airport for marijuana possession.
Saskatoon police say they were contacted by Canada Border Service Agency officials just before midnight on Thursday, where authorities had stopped a traveler, searched his bags and located marijuana. There is no word on the amount Carter allegedly had in his possession.
In a statement released by the Roughrider organization they confirmed Carter had been charged: “We are working to gather more information and continue to monitor the situation.”
The 26-year-old CFL player had flown into Saskatoon for the Kinsmen Sports celebrity dinner and it was business as usual during a media gathering on Friday morning before the news broke.
Carter is scheduled to make his first court appearance at provincial court in Saskatoon on March 27.
RICHMOND, Va. (AP)  A federal appeals court has scheduled arguments for Dec. 5 in the case of a former Russian military officer sentenced to life in prison for leading a 2009 Taliban attack on U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Lawyers for Irek Hamidullin have argued that he shouldn't have faced trial because he is a lawful combatant. Prosecutors, however, say fighters aligned with the Taliban don't qualify for lawful-combatant status.
The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments in December 2016. But in August, the court said it wanted to hear additional arguments after one of the judges announced he was stepping down to serve as Baltimore's city solicitor.
Feb 2 (Reuters) - Bon-Ton Stores Inc, one of the largest U.S. department store operators, has secured a loan that will allow it to file for bankruptcy as early as Sunday, according to people familiar with the matter.
The move will make Bon-Ton, which has about 260 stores and nearly $1 billion in debt, the first major U.S. brick-and-mortar retailer to file for bankruptcy this year.
Last year, more than 15 U.S. retailers filed for bankruptcy, the most in six years, as consumers moved more of their shopping online.
The loan will help Bon-Ton continue to operate in bankruptcy and carry it through a potential sale, the sources said. The size of the bankruptcy loan could not be learned.
The York, Pennsylvania-based retailer has also retained law firm Young Conaway Stargatt & Taylor LLP for its filing, in addition to attorneys from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, the sources added.
Bon-Ton declined to comment. Young Conaway and Paul Weiss did not respond to requests for comment.
Bon-Ton serves smaller communities in 26 states across the U.S. Northeast, Midwest and Great Plains under banners including Bon-Ton, Younkers and Bergner‘s.
Macy's Inc and competitors shuttering their stores has helped Bon-Ton in some communities it operates in, the retailer said in a business plan released this week.
The company had been looking for an investor to infuse new money into the firm ahead of a bankruptcy filing as part of a plan of reorganization, according to disclosures the company had made this week. Those plans called for the retailer's $350 million in bonds to take the equity in a reorganized company.
The company's bonds on Thursday were trading at about 15 cents on the dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data.
On Wednesday, Bon-Ton disclosed the 42 stores it will shutter across the country, with the bulk concentrated in Illinois, Indiana, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
In its business plan, Bon-Ton said its offerings in private label brands and e-commerce presence both need improvement to competes with the lines of Macy‘s, Kohls Corp and J C Penney Company Inc. (Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli in New York; Editing by Kim Coghill)

Good vehicle interiors can be hard to find, especially if you are on a budget. If you are in the market for a decent one, the Subaru Impreza is the most affordable at $29,260 (as tested) — and that's the cheapest one you'll find on Ward's annual best interior list.
The auto news site also named the Bentley Bentayga, which can set you back at least $278,730, one of this year's winners, with Honda (CR-V), Lexus (LC 500), and Mazda (CX-9) being the only brands to return as 10 Best Interiors award recipients.
Aesthetics, comfort, ergonomics, fit-and-finish, materials, and user-friendly electronics are all deciding factors in snagging an interior award by Ward's, which has ranked vehicle cabins for seven years now. To be eligible, a vehicle's interior must be all-new or significantly redesigned for the U.S. market.
Aside from the aforementioned models, this year's list included the Alfa Romeo Giulia, Buick LaCrosse, Lincoln Continental, Maserati Levante, and Mini Countryman.
There's no price cap on eligibility, and in the past, Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Infiniti, and Mercedes-Benz have made the grade. But not this time around — better luck next year.
Instead, interiors like the CX-9's scored a well-earned spot on the prestigious list.
“We designed the Mazda CX-9's interior from the onset with a concept of ‘Smart Indulgence,' recognizing that there's a balance between needs and wants,” said Julien Montousse, Mazda design director, in a statement.
“Our goal was to maximize both functionality for families and opulence for couple looking for a getaway.”
The Lexus LC 500 grabbed a top spot for its breathtaking interior and design elements including “dramatic door trim with grooves that flow like drapery,” according to Ward's.
“Since the concept LF-LC was introduced five years ago — a concept car come to life — there has been nothing but excitement and anticipation for the production LC,” said Jeff Bracken, Lexus vice president and general manager, in a release.
“Working closely with the engineering team, LC designers pursued new means to redefine Lexus style with a dynamic look and the brand's signature attention to detail.”

OTTAWA – Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale says he will soon talk face-to-face with his U.S. counterpart about the difficulties some Canadians are experiencing at the border.
Goodale said Tuesday he will have a chance in coming weeks — no date has been set — to discuss any border “issues or tensions” with Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.
“We're working on the scheduling of that,” Goodale said after a cabinet meeting. “The atmosphere in terms of the preliminary relationship seems to be very, very good.”
The Nexus trusted-traveller cards of about 200 Canadian permanent residents were suddenly cancelled after President Donald Trump issued an executive immigration order banning visitors from seven largely Muslim countries.

There have been several recent reports about minorities being turned away at the U.S. border. At the same time, Manitoba is grappling with an influx of would-be refugees crossing at remote border points in bitterly cold weather.
Goodale was briefed on the refugee issue Tuesday by RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson and Canada Border Services Agency president John Ossowski.
“They're redeploying resources to make sure that they've got the right people at the right place to be able to cope with these matters,” Goodale said.
The border issues have threatened to overshadow progress Canada made this week in Washington on plans for cargo preclearance to speed up trade as well as more extensive co-operation on fending off cyberthreats.

Goodale was among the ministers who accompanied Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on his first visit with Trump.
Canada and the U.S. agreed to move ahead with preclearance of cargo, which allows for the examination of shipments by the destination country at special sites inside the territory of the departure country. The idea is to benefit travellers and trade by reducing congestion and delays at the border.
Goodale hailed the language in a joint Canada-U.S. statement as a “major step forward.”
“It didn't say we were going to study it, we were going to think about it, we're going to work on it — it says from both countries, we are committed to implement it,” he said. “There are some preliminary sites that have been examined for some pilots where we can work out the kinks and the logistics.”
READ MORE: Donald Trump knew for weeks Michael Flynn was misleading over Russia
The efforts would build on cargo pilot projects the countries have already carried out under the 2011 Beyond the Border security pact.
“I think, from my impression (in Washington), the Americans are as keen as we are to make cargo preclearance a reality,” Goodale said.

Currently, people flying to American cities through eight major Canadian airports can be precleared there by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers.
Passenger preclearance is being expanded to Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport and Quebec City's Jean Lesage International Airport, as well as for rail service in Montreal and Vancouver.
On Monday, Canada and the U.S. agreed to bring traveller preclearance to other locations, though one insider said it was too early to say which ones might participate.

The commitment to collaborate more closely on cyberthreats and protecting important systems also builds on existing cross-border efforts.
“We have a number of common critical infrastructure systems that cross the border between our two countries,” Goodale said Tuesday.
“The North American power grid is a good example of that, where there are huge interconnections along the border. And we want to make that as resilient and resistant to attack as we possibly can.”
Malawi Government has fired three nurses in Phalombe for negligence after a woman gave birth in a hospital drainage in January.
District Health officer Ketrina Kondowe said the decision to fire the three was reached at after a full disciplinary hearing at the council led by the District
Commissioner.
The disciplinary hearing was told that the woman arrived at Phalombe health centre for delivery but decades to stay outside the health centre for a breather.
The three nurses, who were on duty, did not help her when labour started and she delivered on her own.
Kondowe said it was the responsibility of the nurses to ensure that all patients are looked after, saying what happened at the health centre was a disgrace.
In January this year, the media reported about the negligent manner in which the three nurses handled Alinafe Mtsinje of Filisi Village, Traditional Authority Kaduya in the district who was denied access to the labour ward on grounds that the room was being cleaned.
This development forced her to deliver her baby in a hospital bathroom drainage.
District Commissioner for Phalombe, Gossam Mafuta confirmed having communicated the dismissal to the three who were interdicted in March, 2018.
He said the whole essence of decentralization was to enhance monitoring and discipline for public service delivery to be effective, as such, the council would not sit around watching non-performance and negligence within its jurisdiction.
“Health Service delivery is a crucial aspect of the whole public service delivery, as such, people working in the sector should be careful when they are executing their duties to ensure that community members can actually rely on them and not fearing them as the case might be,” said Mafuta.
He further expressed commitment that the district council would not condone any misconduct in the public service delivery system.
Public Relations Officer for Phalombe District Health Office, Daniel Chiromo, identified the three nurses as Maureen Chilikutali, Mphatso Chanza and Mercy Sonjera.
Chiromo however worried that the firing of the two would increase the burden on the District Health Office which was already facing an acute shortage of nurses.
Ship's Sponsor Jazania H. O'Neal smashes a bottle of sparkling wine against the bow of the National Security Cutter Midgett (WMSL 757). Also pictured (left to right) are Ingalls Shipbuilding President Brian Cuccias; Coast Guard Vice Commandant Adm. Charles Michel; Matron of Honor Jonna Midgette; and Capt. Anthony Williams, the ship's prospective commanding officer
DECEMBER 11, 2017 — Huntington Ingalls Industries' (NYSE:HII) Ingalls Shipbuilding division christened the Legend-class National Security Cutter Midgett (WMSL 757) at its Pascagoula, MS, shipyard, December 9.
The ship is named to honor John Allen Midgett, who was awarded the Silver Cup by the U.K. Board of Trade in 1918 for the renowned rescue of 42 British sailors aboard the British tanker Mirlo after it was torpedoed by a German U-boat off the coast of North Carolina. He was also awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal by the U.S. Coast Guard in 1924. Midgett was a senior enlisted member of the U.S. Lifesaving Service when it merged with the U.S. Lighthouse Service and U.S. Revenue Cutter Service to become today's U.S. Coast Guard.
"We often speak of our service as a family, our Coast Guard family," said Adm. Charles Michel, vice commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, who was the ceremony's keynote speaker. "The Midgett name takes that seriously with a family legacy unprecedented in the armed services, a family that is all about service before self. Such a special name deserves to be emblazoned on a special platform. The Ingalls Shipbuilding team have built this incredible platform, something to be incredibly proud of and something the men and women of the United States Coast Guard take very proudly."
"Midgett is the eighth ship we have built in this class," said Ingalls Shipbuilding President Brian Cuccias. "And with her, we've proven once again that American workers, Ingalls shipbuilders, can take on some of the most challenging manufacturing projects in the world. All Ingalls ships are built with one goal in mind: to protect the brave men and women who protect our freedom. Our Ingalls/Coast Guard team continues to get stronger and more efficient with every ship we produce. And Midgett will be no exception."
Jazania O'Neal, Midgett's granddaughter, is the ship's sponsor. She christened the ship by breaking a bottle of sparkling wine across its bow, saying, "In the name of the United States of America, I christen thee Midgett. May God bless this ship and all who sail in her."
Ingalls is the sole builder of Legend-class NSCs and has delivered six. Midgett, the eighth ship in the class, was launched in November. Kimball (WMSL 756) is scheduled to be delivered to the Coast Guard in 2018.
Legend-class NSCs are the most technologically advanced ships in the Coast Guard's fleet, with capabilities for maritime homeland security, law enforcement and national security missions. NSCs are 418 feet long with a 54-foot beam and displace 4,500 tons with a full load. They have a top speed of 28 knots, a range of 12,000 miles, an endurance of 60 days and a crew of 120.

BLOOMINGTON, Minn. -- The phone call came on Tuesday, at just the right moment.
Rebecca Burmeff was preparing to return to work for the first time since leaving work to take her son, Lukas Kusters, to the hospital for an emergency X-ray in the spring of 2016. She was going through her laptop bag, which she had barely touched in all the days since, and found a pamphlet from a football camp she was going to send Lukas to and information about a field trip that her husband, Rich, was going to accompany him on before Lukas was diagnosed with stomach cancer. It was a disease that would take his life in June of 2017, just four days after his 10th birthday.
She also pulled out discharge papers from the hospital after Lukas' intitial extended stay there following a round of chemotherapy and radiation they hoped had left him cancer free. The nurses had written, "Congratulations on going home."

"I was just mentally, emotionally, in a bad spot that specific night," Rebecca said. "But a few minutes later, I got a call from Julie [from the Philadelphia Eagles] and she said, 'We've got some great news. We've been thinking about you guys a lot, and we've got six tickets to the Super Bowl for you, and we want you guys here. We wish Lukas could be here with us, but we want you guys out here with us.' I was pretty floored by it. It was quite a shock."
A special connection between Lukas and quarterback Carson Wentz has led to a bond between his family and the Eagles organization. Known as the Dutch Destroyer for his ferocity of spirit and style of play on the football field, Lukas -- the biggest of Eagles fans -- used Wentz's hope for inspiration as he took on what doctors immediately described as the fight of his life. Hearing about Lukas from one of his radiation technicians, Wentz sent him a video of encouragement while he was in the hospital. Lukas' Make-A-Wish was to thank Wentz for that gesture. The two spent a day together at the Eagles' practice facility, and that's when Lukas gave Wentz a "Dutch Destroyer" bracelet that Wentz wears every day, even during games.
"Why would I take it off?" Wentz said recently. "The impact that Lukas has had on this team, on me, people all over. I'll run into fans that aren't even Eagles fans, but they would come up to me and want to talk about the Dutch Destroyer."
Since Lukas' death, the family has shipped about 65,000 bracelets and raised about $300,000 for the Live Like Lukas foundation, which helps those impacted by childhood cancer. Rebecca has been flooded with letters from people affected by their story, including over 100 alone from a fifth-grade class at Garden Lakes Elementary in Arizona, after their teacher introduced the story of Lukas, his family and Wentz to them as part of a curriculum about heroes. In Muenster, Texas, a youth team dedicated its season to Lukas, with the name Dutch Destroyer on the back of their jerseys where the individual names usually go.
Lukas' story has reached people across the country and beyond, and has become part of the fabric of the Eagles' 2017 season.
"[The Eagles] just rallied around us since all of this really started, they really haven't stopped rallying around us, and they've just made us feel like family," Rebecca said. "It makes me feel like they're feeling what we do ... like Lukas has been there with them this whole season and that he's very well at least a piece of what's so special about this season. It just means the world to us to be here."
On Thursday, two days after being notified of the Super Bowl tickets, they rented a Suburban, packed the whole family and their luggage into the car and drove 19 hours from Philadelphia to Minneapolis. Rebecca drove the first nine hours before Rich took over.
"I said, you get us up to Week 13 like Carson did, and I'll come in like [Nick] Foles and finish the job," Rich said.
Before they left, they visited the cemetery where Lukas is buried. They brought a framed picture of him on the ride.
Rebecca says she talks to Wentz every couple of weeks and believes he had a part in getting them the six Super Bowl tickets to Sunday's game against the New England Patriots.
"From what I understand, he played a big role in making this happen," she said.
Standing in the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, Rich pointed to the sign above the Super Bowl apparel shop. When most look at the "LII", they see the Roman numerals representing Super Bowl 52. Rich sees an "L" for Lukas, and an "11" for Wentz, another sign that this is a team of destiny.
"I was just sitting there watching TV, and I saw Super Bowl LII," Rich said of the first time he made that connection. "Bec was in the bedroom, and I just came on in and I said, 'Bec, we're going to win this.' And she said, 'I already know that.' And I said, 'No, we're really going to win this.' I said, 'Look at this.' She said, 'Oh my goodness' and she got the chills. She knew [the Eagles were going to win] before I even had to show her, but that's how I recognized it."
CALGARY – Anti-dumping duties on U.S. drywall imports into Western Canada have hiked prices for the building product but have also resulted in new manufacturing jobs, says the company whose complaint prompted the trade tariffs.
CertainTeed Gypsum Canada has added about 30 employees since duties began in September at its drywall plants in Vancouver, Calgary and Winnipeg to boost production, said spokesman Mike Loughery in an email.

“Shifts have been added and production has been increased to respond to market demand,” he wrote, adding he couldn't comment for competitive reasons on how much output has been increased.
The Canadian International Trade Tribunal is scheduled to rule Wednesday on whether imports of drywall or gypsum board from the United States have injured the western Canadian industry, with reasons for the decision to follow 15 days later.
If the answer is yes, preliminary duties of up to 276 per cent on U.S. imports into Canada for use in B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and the Yukon and Northwest Territories could be made permanent.

Kevin Sheptycki, assistant business manager with the Boilermakers union that represents CertainTeed workers, said the jobs prove the duties are working and must be continued.
“For our members … and for CertainTeed to be able to continue to operate in the market and make a profit at a fair market price, we need the duties to stay in place.”
But Neal Pollock, spokesman for the Western Canada Alliance of Wall and Ceiling Contractors, said the duties are causing significant harm to the construction industry and should be removed.
He said contractors report increases in drywall prices of between 30 per cent in Alberta and 55 per cent in B.C., costs they have had to absorb under contracts signed before the duties began.
“The magnitude of the harm is significant,” said Pollock, president of industrial contractor TDL Drywall in Calgary.
“We need zero duties … and we also need some kind of government-mandated refund for the duties that have already been paid.”
The preliminary drywall levy was imposed by the Canada Border Services Agency after it found that U.S. products are being “dumped” in Canada — meaning they are being sold for less than in their home markets.
Mississauga, Ont.-based CertainTeed, owned by a French corporation, is the only remaining manufacturer of drywall in Western Canada after two plants owned by Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific in Alberta and B.C. were closed in 2009 and 2011. Georgia-Pacific is on record as opposing the duties on its U.S.-made products.
The tribunal held a nine-day hearing in Edmonton in early December to consider the matter.
READ MORE: Fort McMurray rebuild threatened after feds impose drywall tariff
The CITT is also expected Wednesday to issue a separate report into whether the duties are harming consumers, with findings and recommendations on remedies to follow.
Such reports are typically researched and written after a finding of injury, but the CITT employed a rare parallel process at the request of Finance Minister Bill Morneau.
He asked in October for an accelerated review over concerns the duties were causing higher drywall prices that are hurting consumers, especially those involved in rebuilding Fort McMurray, Alta., after last spring's devastating wildfire.
Finance spokesman Jack Aubry said in an email the government will consider the CITT recommendations before deciding on a course of action, without saying what options are being considered.
CertainTeed argued in a written submission to the tribunal that the drywall duties would increase the cost of a typical new single family home by less than one per cent.
A judicial magistrate on Tuesday sent a schoolteacher on a 3 day judicial remand to jail for brutally torturing a student in Gilgit.
Rafat Babar was a student of Grade 5.
She barely would have been 10 years old and had to be taken to hospital.
Hitting a child of that age to an extent that she succumbed to the injuries, says a lot about our societal inhumanity, and how little we care about the vulnerable.
Reports suggest that the teacher belongs to an influential political family, who is using every possible mean to protect her and prevent the investigation from carrying onward.
They have threatened the police who are involved in the investigation, the journalists who reported the story to TV channels, and claimed the child died because of other reasons.
This trend of abusing and torturing students is not new.
While urban centres have ensured the removal of such practices, they are still prevalent in rural areas.
Many also associate a teacher's dedication to work with the hitting practices.
However, as the system has progressed, people have failed to grasp the idea that learning through fear is counterproductive to the psychological development of the child.
The National Assembly passed a bill in 2013 which prohibited corporal punishment of children in educational institutions.
Despite this, many schools and madrasas continue to dish out corporal punishment due to cultural acceptance.
Corporal punishment at schools is a major factor that contributes to one of the highest dropout rates in the world.
According to SPARC (an Islamabad based NGO), around 35,000 high school students in Pakistan drop out of the primary education system annually due to corporal punishment.
According to the SPARC, seventy cases of corporal punishment had been reported from 2011-2012 across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa alone, out of which 7 innocent children committed suicide due to the extremity of the punishment in Charsadda, Nowshera, Chitral and Timergara.
It is harrowing to think how many cases may go unreported.
No one is sitting up and taking notice, while innocent children do not have the means to protect themselves.

It is now only four days before the ANC's much-awaited national conference. Both domestic and international observers are holding their breath, wondering: who will be elected president?
The focus is not on policies; it is on the personality at the top. This is so because there is widespread anxiety to end the destructive reign of Jacob Zuma. People can't wait to see his back.
We must not hasten to blame people who are obsessed with the man or woman at the top. To history, a political party is a vehicle; the leader is the driver. Such has been the story of modern political man.
The problem arises when historians cause a party to disappear in the shadow of a leader. All the great personages of history are idolised as if they were loners operating outside the strictures of institutions.
What is often forgotten is that the image of a leader is sometimes a deliberate product of a party or faction that seeks to project a particular character. Armies trumpet the bravery of their generalissimo, even as we all know that wars are fought out there on the battlefield by the rank and file.
No war was ever fought in the staid office of a clever general with animated drawings of mountains and rivers on a map laid out on a glittering mahogany table. It is as important to penetrate the character of the army as it is wise to study the personality of the general.
Prices at the Pump Up over Last Year in Columbia
COLUMBIA, SC (WOLO)–The latest numbers on gas prices in Columbia are higher than this same time last year.
Gas Buddy dot com says the cost per gallon has not moved from the $2.62 per gallon mark we saw last week.
But prices in Columbia are more than 63 cents higher per gallon than they were in 2017, say experts.
The Midlands average is still better than the national average, which is $2.96 a gallon.
Fall-related injuries and fatalities among Hawaii seniors are reaching troubling numbers.
Every year, an average of 86 seniors die and more than 8000 are treated at emergency rooms.
But falls are preventable.
This morning on Wake Up 2day, Stanley Michael, Fall Prevention Specialist with the State Department of Health joined us in studio to talk about the issue.
Michael says the state has nine companies at 66 locations on 5 islands participating in the campaign. Many pharmacies will be offering free medication reviews and balance testing for seniors. It helps determine fall risk as well as safe use of medications.
Project VISION Hawaii is offering free eye exams and eyeglasses to seniors in need and Project Dana is offering free Personal Electronic Safety Devices to seniors especially those living alone.
Plus tai chi classes continue for seniors now expanded to 36 locations statewide. And during July the state will be offering a meet and greet with home safety experts at the Kaimuki and Pearl City City Mill stores.
Just about every hour on the hour a senior is transported by ambulance to an emergency room because of a fall injury. That is over 8,050 per year. Many of those seniors never return to a normal life, with many requiring full time living assistance. In addition to the physician and hospital costs of approximately $120 million per year, add physical therapy, and long term care costs that are even more expensive. If you add the four costs together, just in Hawaii, it totals over $250,000,000 million per year. That's over $684,000 per day.
Falls are preventable. They are not inevitable just because someone ages. Everyone falls. In Hawaii, over 22,000 citizens must visit an emergency room each year because of a fall injury. Many of those just bounce back and brush it off and heal. However, when a senior falls, it is much more serious, because senior bones are more brittle and break easier…not to mention all of the other aging maladies that can contribute to difficult recovery.
The state recommends 5 easy steps to reduce falls. Medication Review, Annual Vision Check, Stay Active and Exercise, Make Your Home Safer, and if you live alone or are alone for long stretches of time, you must get a Personal Electronic Safety Device.

Australian Yachting Championship 2018 - Entries reach double figures
2018 Australian Yachting Championships first entrant Wicked from Victoria Australian Sailing 2018 Australian Yachting Championships first entrant Wicked from Victoria Australian Sailing
by Australian Sailing today at 7:46 amMike Welsh's Beneteau First 40, Wicked was the first entry received with the highly decorated Victorian entrant looking forward to the Championships to complement their busy season of racing.Since being purchased in 2008, Wicked has finished second overall in the 2009 Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race and competed in the ORCV Melbourne to Stanley, Land Rover Sydney Gold Coast Yacht Race, Hamilton Island Race Week and the Adelaide to Port Lincoln with consistent results.“Wicked's first major focus after being purchased was the 2009 Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race, where we placed second overall behind sister ship Two True,” Mike's son, Mark said. “The race proved to be almost ideal for the Beneteau First 40 and it was an extremely close tussle between the two of us for most of the race, but ultimately their decision to acquire a Code 0, which we did not have at the time, proved to be a major factor.”The father-son Welsh duo are regular faces at Sandringham Yacht Club with a number of Club Champion trophies in the cabinet, and alongside their long-term regular crew, are prepared and eager to contest the 2018 Australian Yachting Championship.“We are pretty excited about the opportunity to participate in the Australian Yachting Championship because it is focussed around the type of sailing we love, and it is being hosted at our home Club,” Mark said.
In preparation for the Championships, Wicked will be racing in the Sandringham Yacht Club Winter and Summer Series as well as the ORCV Melbourne to Stanley Race in November with the crew out to maintain a consistent scorecard following mixed results so far in 2017.
“We have had an interesting year that started with finishing 25th overall and fourth in our division in the 2016 Rolex Sydney Hobart and placed third in IRC 1 at the Club Championships behind the well campaigned J111, Joust and sister-ship, Bandit, who are both expected to compete in the Yachting Championships,” Mark said.
The philosophy on-board Wicked is; race hard, but have fun at the same time.
“Keelboat racing offers the opportunity to compete as a team, and despite a variety of backgrounds; Team Wicked come together as a strong unit with a common love of sailing,” Mark said.
“While we push each other hard whilst racing, we also enjoy a lot of laughs on and off water, like an extended family. Keelboat racing also provides the challenge of ocean racing, both locally in Bass Strait but also interstate in challenging events such as the Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race and Adelaide to Port Lincoln, all the while enjoying some time cruising to and from the destinations.”
Alongside Wicked, a strong contingent of Victorian boats have also registered for the 2018 Australian Yachting Championship including; A Cunning Plan (Jon Lechte), Doesn't Matter (Jade Cole), Jazz Player (Matt Lawrence), Joust (Rod Warren), More Noise (Jason Close), Nutcracker II (Rob Davis and Andy Baker), Phoenix (Alex Tseberg), Playlist (Mather Powell), Scarlet Runner (Robert Date), Sierra Chainsaw (Mel, Andrew and Patrick Mollison) and White Noise (Daniel Edwards).
The 2018 Australian Yachting Championship will be held in conjunction with the 2018 Sandringham Yacht Club Regatta, which will include various other handicap series.

Universal Cable Productions (UCP) has selected Erin Woods and David Merrit II as the winners of the company's second annual Pitch Fest competition, Variety has learned exclusively.
In its second year running the competition, UCP focused on diversity with the goal of discovering writers and stories that highlight a range of topics from ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation, to socio-economic status, age, physical abilities, and religious beliefs. The competition attracted more than 1,400 submissions, with 18 finalists given 10 minutes to pitch their idea to UCP's development team. The winning pitches, “Futures,” submitted by Wood, and “The Haints,” submitted by Merritt, have both been placed into active development at the studio.
“We had a harder time picking the winner this year, which is why we picked two,” Dawn Olmstead, executive vice president of development for Universal Cable Productions and Wilshire Studios, told Variety. “There were probably 10 real strong contenders and two came out of that. Last year we had 500 submissions, this year we had 1,400. So we nearly tripled the amount of submissions so it was really hard to get down to the finalists.”
Wood is a graduate of UC-Berkeley and holds a bachelor of arts degree in multicultural literature. She participated in the Bay Area production workshop, Queer Women of Color Media Arts Project (QWOCMAP) where she wrote, directed, and edited her first short film “The Saint,” which went on to screen at several film festivals. Her winning Pitch Fest submission is centered around five brilliant millennials from disadvantaged backgrounds who discover they are each owned by private shareholders who are banking on their future. With the realization that their lives are not their own, they will be forced to focus their superior minds on how to break free.
“There were a couple of reasons why we liked this and Erin,” Olmstead said. “If you are an underprivileged kid from one of these disparate backgrounds, that automatically gives you an outsider view of the world. We felt that through these different perspectives and the different reasons why these families were vulnerable to this kind of sponsorship, the taking advantage of the underprivileged but in a futuristic way, made this very compelling.”
Merritt earned a bachelor of arts degree in art history from East Carolina University and a master's degree in film from the University of North Carolina. He began his career in the entertainment industry as a writer and director for “WWE Monday Night RAW” on the USA Network and “WWE Smack Down” on The CW. Later, his horror script, “Hangman,” placed in the finals of the Screamfest LA screenwriting competition and in the second round of the PAGE International Screenwriting Awards. His winning Pitch Fest submission is a sci-fi thriller set in the early 90's where six African-American teens are implicated when a white female classmate goes missing. Determined to bring her back alive, the teens delve into the world of tormented spirits and demons that plague the forest surrounding their urban home.
“I think [David] was incredibly well prepared with diagrams of where the spirits live, how the town worked, the history of what could have haunted this place,” Olmstead said. “He had a deep mythology that supported this take on both race and a time of your life that should be full of hope and how that can quickly end. He's from the South, so he comes from a town that believes in this phenomenon. We also read his other work and really enjoyed it.”
To expand its outreach efforts this year, UCP partnered with NBCUniversal Talent Infusion Programs (NBCUNI TIPS), which are dedicated to promoting diversity and inclusion within the television industry.

The Lives of Others, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's 2006 film about an East German secret service agent spying on a couple in 1984 Berlin, is on the surface a rather stock film about people living in an oppressive regime. The tropes are all there: the secret police agent who begins to question who exactly he's serving, the reticent man jolted into taking a stand against injustice, and the artist who must choose between personal or creative integrity. Throw in some bleak lighting and nondescript concrete buildings and we could be anywhere between Berlin and Moscow.
What is unique about The Lives of Others is that von Donnersmarck is not content to simply wind these characters up like toy soldiers and watch them trudge to the end of the story. The characters in The Lives of Others are much more akin to spinning tops on a small table that smash into each other and alter their courses irreparably.
It is through these collisions that von Donnersmarck expresses the contradictions of East Germany: one could either serve the state or its citizens, but never both. The well-intentioned, anonymous meddling of Stasi secret police agent Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) on behalf of a couple, writer Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), improves the relationship between the pair at the cost of intensifying the state's violent investigation into their lives. All of the actors turn in complex, tortured performances that reflect the complex choices they face. Ulrich Mühe's performance as Wiesler is especially moving, portraying a Stasi agent with empathy and cruelty, making both his lifetime of service to an oppressive regime and his change in perspective on Dreyman and Sieland seem believable, if not inevitable. Von Donnersmarck's use of Wiesler's written reports makes these changes in Wiesler's attitudes towards Dreyman and Sieland especially striking.
The narrative structure of the film itself leads to basic questions surrounding human nature. As the viewer watches a man watch other people, von Donnersmarck seems to not only question the nature of the surveillance state but also the nature of the cinematic experience. What is it that we like so much about watching the minutiae of other people's lives unfold? Are Wiesler and the rest of the Stasi an aberration or just an extreme perversion of an innate human desire to know the intimate details of someone else's life?
The film's greatest strength, however, is its ending. The tragedy of it serves as a warning to both the totalitarian state and the voyeuristic individual: perhaps the lives of others are best left alone.
Police are looking for a vehicle involved in a hit-and-run that claimed the life of a pedestrian in Thorsby, Alta. on Friday. As Sarah Kraus reports, they believe the incident may have started with a gas-and-dash.

SIALKOT-PML-N stalwart Daniyal Aziz has said that the 2018 general elections will prove to be a referendum against the disqualification of Nawaz Sharif and the revenge in the name of accountability. Talking to the newsmen at Shakargarh here, he said that the Nawaz Sharif is still ruling the hearts and minds of the masses, adding that politically-matured people would reject the elements who have been promoting negative politics and had hatched conspiracies against the development and stability of the country.
He said that the "tiger" will roar again after winning the 2018 general elections with the power of the votes. He said that the PML-N would continue its struggle for restoring respect, honour and dignity of the vote and voters.
MURDERER SENTENCED TO DEATH
Additional District and Session Judge (ADSJ) Shakargarh Sehar Islam awarded death sentence to an accused Sami Ullah and life imprisonment to co-accused Rashid Ali for killing their brother-in-law (Behnoi) Qaisar Mehmood in 2017 over love marriage with their sister in 2003 in village Chakra-Noor Kot-Chak Amru, Shakargarh tehsil here.
The ADSJ also acquitted third accused Allah Ditta by giving him the benefit of doubt.
SIAL OFFICE-BEARERS
Leading exporters Nadeem Anwar Qureshi and Haseeb Ahmed Bhatti were unanimously elected as Chairman and Vice Chairman respectively of Sialkot International Airport Limited (SIAL).
They assumed the charge of their offices here on Tuesday.
Addressing the participants of a prestigious ceremony, the newly-elected office bearers of SIAL pledged to utilize their energies for the development and advancement of Sialkot International Airport besides providing world class aviation facilities to the passengers at the airport.
2017 Lincoln Continental Enlarge Photo
Lincoln is experimenting with a program to offer owners and lessees a taste of the finer things in life as it begins testing its latest service simply called "Lincoln Chauffeur." As the name implies, the program allows Lincoln drivers to become the driven with a personal driver and shopping assistant.
The brand states it has worked with a third party to train chauffeurs and prepare them to wine and dine the owner with whatever is deemed necessary. Want to look good for your date? Have the driver deliver you in style while relaxing in the rear seat of your Continental. Do the kids need to be picked up from school? Your chauffeur can skedaddle on down to the school in your Navigator. The options are pretty endless.
It's a generous service, too. Lincoln will allow eight hours of Chauffeur to give owners a taste of the lifestyle of the rich and famous. After that, the marque plans to charge $30 for every extra hour the driver is needed.
Lincoln is simply testing the new program right now and the service is only available in Miami, Florida. However, after Miami, the brand plans to launch Lincoln Chauffeur in San Diego, California, to continue ironing out any wrinkles that may present themselves along the way. Plans for a nationwide launch have not been discussed at this time.
We suppose there will always be those who simply cannot stand time behind the wheel. For those consumers, Lincoln may really have something for you here. You'll just need to be cool with a stranger behind the wheel of your car.

Police don't know how the thief of thieves entered the unoccupied room to remove the jewelry. TMZ, which first reported the news, said Stamos rushed to the hotel after the incident to comfort McHugh.
Geoffrey Smith heard it first from his neighbors: The wind-driven wildfire that swept through northern San Diego County had devoured his Bonsall home.
As he headed to his neighborhood over the weekend to see the destruction, the 70-year-old veterinarian's mind drifted to what he likely lost.
A cherry wood cabinet he was making for his daughter in the barn out back. His family photos. Mementos grateful clients had given him. His wedding ring, which he'd taken off because his finger was swollen. A Bible his wife, Diana, gave him when they got married.
“Today is our 27th wedding anniversary,” he said Saturday, his eyes welling up with tears. They raised four kids in that home. “It had views to die for.”
All that was left was a pile of rubble. Soot-covered terracotta planters sat among heaps of ash and debris, as well as charred metal that had been furniture.
The destructive Lilac fire, which ignited Thursday near the intersection of State Route 76 and Interstate 15, scorched 4,100 acres and destroyed more than 150 structures, including homes and farm outbuildings. An additional 56 structures were damaged and 1,500 more were at risk, authorities said Sunday evening.
While residents reeled from the devastation, fire crews from San Diego to Los Angeles gained the upper hand on a series of wildfires fed during the last week by powerful Santa Ana winds. By Sunday evening, the Lilac fire, the cause of which is under investigation, was 75% contained and evacuation orders were lifted for large swaths of Bonsall and Fallbrook.
“Turning a corner would be a good way to put it,” said Capt. Jon Heggie of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. “It didn't grow at all today.”
Some 130 miles north, firefighters increased containment Sunday evening on three wildfires that ripped through communities in Los Angeles County.
All residents displaced by the Skirball fire — which scorched 422 acres, destroyed six structures and damaged another 12 — were allowed to return home. The blaze that tore through the exclusive Bel-Air neighborhood was 85% contained.
The 6,049-acre Rye fire in Santa Clarita was 93% contained Sunday evening, while the 15,619-acre Creek fire in Sylmar was 95% contained.
Though winds calmed down Sunday, firefighters remained on high alert due to bone dry weather. A red flag warning, indicating extreme fire danger, was extended until Monday evening across much of Ventura and Los Angeles counties, according to the National Weather Service.
A similar warning in San Diego County expired at 8 p.m. Sunday. There, signs thanking firefighters were placed up and down West Lilac Road, where the fire swept through avocado groves and farms in the initial hours of the blaze.
A handful of Smith's neighbors on the hilly Wrightwood Road in Bonsall also lost their homes. Some said they felt grateful to be alive.
“I was going to have to put in new kitchen cabinets and counters pretty soon,” said Mike Hulsizer, who lost his four-bedroom home. “I probably saved myself $20,000 right there.”
His 1949 Oldsmobile, a restoration project he inherited from a friend who died of cancer, was nearly finished after five years of work. It was gone, along with his Osprey Pilothouse boat.
Somehow, his chicken, Ole Red, rode out the fire in a coop, which was littered with ash. His wife's garden was also relatively unscathed, a zucchini plant and bird feeder still intact.
“We're going to rebuild,” Hulsizer said. “I believe something good will come out of this.”

“Not enough ... has been said about the many men and women who poured their hearts and lives into the show and were just getting started on next season,” Sherwood said. “We're so sorry they were swept up in all of this and we give thanks for their remarkable talents, wish them well, and hope to find another way to work together down the road.”
On Tuesday, the Montreal Canadiens dropped a bombshell, firing coach Michel Therrien and replaced him with Claude Julien, who was fired by the Boston Bruins last week. Julien, a Stanley Cup-winning coach with the Bruins, takes over the Canadiens, who are leading the Atlantic Division but have been struggling.
Scott Burnside and Joe McDonald discuss whether or not this move will change the culture in Montreal to help lead the team to success down the stretch and into the Stanley Cup playoffs.
Burnside: No love for Michel Therrien in Montreal on Valentine's Day. I feel bad for the veteran coach who, like successor Claude Julien, always seemed to be getting fired as the head coach of the Canadiens. Of course, Julien will now enjoy the same honeymoon period that all new coaches enjoy, but soon enough Julien will feel the same pressure experienced by all coaches in Montreal. And there's a weird kind of symmetry to this whole thing. Therrien was on his second go-around as Habs head coach and now Julien returns to the high-pressure post he held for parts of three seasons more than a decade ago. What surprises me is that Julien would sign on for the pressure cooker of the Montreal job just a week after he was fired by the Bruins. Maybe the lure of returning to the most storied franchise in the NHL was too great. Maybe the fact the Habs are a first-place club was a factor. Maybe the chance at getting right back at the Bruins was also part of the mix. But you've known Julien a long time, Joe. What were your first impressions of the dramatic coaching moves that marked Valentine's Day?
McDonald: Scotty, I'm not surprised at all that Julien would accept this challenge to return to the Canadiens only a week after being fired. The thing that does shock me is Bruins president Cam Neely would give the Canadiens permission to speak with Julien; Neely has a true hatred toward the rival Canadiens. But this could be a true sign of respect for Julien that Neely and GM Don Sweeney allowed him to explore other opportunities. In fact, according to a source, other teams were given permission to speak with Julien too. Regardless, it's the right thing to do on the Bruins' part. For the Canadiens, this is a bold and brilliant move by GM Marc Bergevin to hire Julien. Something needed to be done in Montreal and this move could be the reason the Canadiens enjoy a deep run in the Stanley Cup playoffs.
Burnside: One of the interesting sidebars after Julien was fired was the fact that the Bruins were actually a good puck-possession team. The Canadiens, as you noted in a piece, hit the bye week in a bit of a funk. Goalie Carey Price has been sideways for a while, there have been injuries and there's been the schedule that has seen Montreal play seven games in 11 days, ironically finishing with a desultory 4-0 loss to the Bruins and new head coach Bruce Cassidy. Still, if people think Julien is going to introduce a new style of hockey to the Habs, they might be forgetting that Therrien -- at least when Price has been healthy -- has played a pretty impressive style of defensive hockey too. In spite of their recent trip sideways, the Canadiens are still eighth in goals allowed per game. Where do you see Julien having a big influence in terms of the Habs' style of play, Joey Mac?

McDonald: Julien-coached teams have always had success when they stick to their structure. Yes, he values the defense-first mentality, but in Boston we've seen what happens when Julien has a world-class goaltender and a solid defensive core -- it results in a potent offense. He's also taking over this team when the roster is healthy. Julien has instant credibility with the Canadiens and has worked with Price on Team Canada for the Olympics and World Cup. And I think it's hysterical that he goes from coaching a team with Brad Marchand to one with Andrew Shaw. I also don't think Bergevin is done making changes. He's working the phones, trying to make his team better because a coaching change isn't the only thing Montreal needs.
Burnside: The pressure is indeed on Bergevin to make this team better. If he can't add depth up front and specifically down the middle, and this team gets caught by the Ottawa Senators (which could happen, setting up a potentially perfect first-round matchup with Boston) or if they win the Atlantic and are eliminated in the first round (which is another distinct possibility, given that there's going to be an excellent Metropolitan Division team crossing over in the first round), then Bergevin is going to look like a guy who made a coaching change because that's what the public demanded. But I don't think he's that kind of guy and I do think there is help to come in the form of a Martin Hanzal or someone similar before the March 1 trade deadline. But by making this kind of move, Bergevin set himself up as a fall guy in a town that loves to take its hockey people down. So, how do you see this playing out over the next few weeks and months?
McDonald: Julien is a much different coach now than during his first stint with the Canadiens. He's won a Stanley Cup and knows what it takes to enjoy success in the spring. The initial move will pay dividends for Bergevin and the Canadiens. It would be great theater if somehow the Canadiens and Bruins compete in the Stanley Cup playoffs. Julien would never admit it, but no doubt there's a part of him that accepted this job with a sense of retribution. If Bergevin acquires other important pieces, and the Canadiens enjoy a deep run, the GM will look like a genius. If the team's current tailspin continues, then he will become the fall guy. But there's no doubt in my mind he made the right move by hiring Julien.
On Saturday night, while his band Queens Of The Stone Age were performing at KROQ's Almost Acoustic Christmas show in Los Angeles, frontman Josh Homme kicked photographer Chelsea Lauren in the face. She's written about how he looked right at her and smiled just before kicking her. In an initial apology, Homme write that he was “in a state of being lost in performance” when he kicked her and that he “would never intentionally cause harm to anyone working at or attending one of our shows.” Perhaps realizing that this apology sucked, Homme has now shared a video of himself apologizing a second time.
In the first of two videos on the Queens Of The Stone Age Instagram, a contrite-looking Homme says, “I'd just like to apologize to Chelsea Lauren. I don't have any excuse or reason to justify what I did. I was a total dick.”

In the second of those two videos, Homme says, “I want to be a good man, but I think last night I definitely failed that that. And that means I failed my family and my friends, as well… I'm gonna have to figure out some stuff, I think. Because rock 'n' roll's a wonderful thing. It's supposed to save and help people and not mess them up.” After extending his apology to his bandmates and to the members of him family, Homme tells Lauren, “I understand that you have to do whatever you have to do.”
2/2 A post shared by QOTSA (@queensofthestoneage) on Dec 10, 2017 at 10:14pm PST
On an Instagram post from Lauren, Eddie Vedder's wife Jill commented, writing, “I'm so very sorry this happened to you … this guy is a piece of shit .. never liked him… I'm horrified .. and truly disgusted …” (You can see a screenshot of her comment here.) Meanwhile, the celebrity chef and TV host Anthony Bourdain, a friend of Homme, tweeted this:

Karachi
Indus Motor Company (IMC) initiated a Clean-drive campaign across the city of Karachi in partnership with Society for “I Am Karachi” (IAK). Spread over four months, the drive aims not only to clean Karachi but to bring citizens together to foster a sense of civic responsibility, ownership and unity among the Karachiites for keeping their city clean and litter-free.
The drive was initiated of an opening ceremony from the Umair Memorial Football Ground in Steel Town which was attended by members of IMC, IAK, civil society, and the local community.
The spirit shared by IMC at the ceremony was one which goes beyond producing cars. IMC believes in playing a leading role in retaining the cities of Pakistan and partnering with local communities to make our cities better, cleaner and vibrant places to live.
Through this clean drive, IMC aims to share its Toyota philosophies that have made the company successful, with the local communities. One such concept is the 5S principles. These principles and concepts can be applied by citizens to every task that they do to become more efficient and deliver quality results while maintaining cleanliness and becoming more organized.
In his address, Feroz Khan, Executive Committee Member, Society for ‘I Am Karachi', said the Society is a city-wide platform that aims to create a counter-narrative message of hope, pride and ownership against the current backdrop that is replete with extremism and despondency by uniting all groups belonging to Karachi and embracing the Toyota 5S principles to make a difference.
The campaign entails a series of awareness and mobilization sessions in which the organizers will visit different communities, towns, schools, colleges and vocational institutes to engage citizens in a meaningful way. These awareness sessions will help develop a sense of cooperation and ownership among the communities in promoting and maintaining cleanliness in their respective areas and in their neighbourhoods.

A man who ploughed a van into a crowd of people near a mosque in London after becoming "obsessed" with Muslims has been found guilty of murder and attempted murder.
Darren Osborne, 48, who grew up in Weston-super-Mare, was tried after killing Makram Ali, 51, and injuring several others near Finsbury Park in North London.
Osborne, who was living in Glyn Rhosyn in Cardiff at the time of the incident on June 19 last year, pleaded not guilty to deliberately mowing down the worshippers.
But a jury of eight women and four men took just under an hour to convict the father-of-four on Thursday, February 1. Osborne, who had denied both charges, nodded and looked around the courtroom as the verdicts were delivered at Woolwich Crown Court.
During the trial, the court heard how he had grown angry at the rise in terrorism and the Rotherham child sex scandal and "decided to take matter into his own hands".
(Image: Daily Mirror)
His partner at the time, Sarah Andrews, described Osborne as a “loner and a functioning alcoholic” with an “unpredictable temperament”.
Taking to the stand earlier this week, the defendant told the court he wanted to kill Muslims and also hoped to kill Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and London Mayor Sadiq Khan to highlight what he considered to be an inadequate response to child grooming gangs and other acts of terror.
However, the jury trying the case were directed by Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb not to become “distracted” by the defendant's views as they considered their verdicts.

The unemployed father-of-four claimed to have plotted with two men called Terry Jones and Dave to “plough through as many” people as possible at a pro-Palestinian march, before abandoning the idea and travelling to Finsbury Park for a drink in a pub.
Osborne said Dave had jumped into the van under the railway bridge along Seven Sisters Road and got in the footwell, before switching with him, but denies knowing Dave was going to drive into pedestrians.
But prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC said there was no evidence of more than one person in the van, and dismissed Osborne's eleventh hour defence as “nonsense”.

The defendant was trying to pin the blame on someone he had “invented” because he “does not have the courage of his convictions”, Mr Rees said.
He said: “Dave did not vanish into thin air, did he? He was never there in the first place.”
Earlier this week Osborne likened his supposed companion to the magician Dynamo, when asked to explain why he was the only person seen on CCTV getting out of the van after the collision.
Mr Rees said: “And Dave may be a funny fella, but he is not a magician, is he?”
Osborne replied: “He's like Dynamo, an illusion. An illusionist. He can make himself vanish, perhaps. I don't know.”

Justice Cheema-Grubb also explained to the jury why Osborne was not facing terror charges, saying “murder is murder”, whatever the motivation.
The incident took place at a mosque near Finsbury Park in London after 12.15am on June 19 , 2017.
Osborne was seen driving in to a group of people stood outside on the pavement which included 51-year-old Mr Ali who later died.
Darren Osborne was a “ticking time bomb” who turned into a smiling murderer within weeks after becoming obsessed with killing as many Muslims as possible.
The unemployed father-of-four appeared “brainwashed” after viewing a BBC drama based on the Rochdale grooming scandal and finding material from the far-right online, according to his estranged partner.
The 48-year-old had not shown racist tendencies before Three Girls aired in May last year but began making comments about Muslims raping children and blowing people up in the weeks after, Sarah Andrews said.
The London Bridge attack and Manchester Arena bombing which followed soon after “seemed to fuel the rage inside him”, prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC told his trial.
Devices seized from the family home in Cardiff, where he would sometimes stay, showed internet searches for Britain First, the English Defence League and a video which claimed to show Muslims celebrating following the Paris terror attack.
It appeared to Ms Andrews that Osborne was becoming brainwashed, and with the benefit of hindsight she described him a “ticking time-bomb”.
Osborne had a history of violence and served two years in prison for assault. He had suffered alcohol and drug abuse and was on medication for anxiety and depression.
His trial heard that he had tried to kill himself twice in the lead up to the attack, but no psychiatric evidence was placed before the jury by his defence team.
After a decade of unemployment Osborne felt worthless and like an outcast, Ms Andrews said. He was a “loner and a functioning alcoholic” with an “unpredictable temperament”.
Police said he had a “dysfunctional family”, lacked a stable home and frequently sofa-surfed.
The night before the attack, he slept in a tent erected in his estranged partner's garden.
Is it time to think the unthinkable?
Could Newcastle United still end up in the play-offs?
The thing is, if they play like this in their remaining three Championship fixtures, it could go down to the wire.
Chris Hughton's Brighton and Hove Albion, promoted yesterday after Huddersfield Town were held to a 1-1 draw by Derby County, had been sprinting towards the finish line.
Newcastle, by contrast, are limping along in second place.
Third-placed Reading are six points behind United. Huddersfield, with a game in hand, are a further point behind them.
In truth, Newcastle haven't been playing well, consistently, for months.
Injuries and suspension have been factors, as was the decision not to invest in January.
Rafa Benitez wanted a midfielder and a winger. And his team has certainly been lacking creativity of late.
United have had enough quality and character to get results, but they haven't been as convincing as they were in the first half of the season when Dwight Gayle and Jonjo Shelvey were in their pomp.
Shelvey was dreadful yesterday at Portman Road, where Newcastle were deservedly beaten 3-1.
But he wasn't the only one.
There wasn't nearly enough character and quality from Benitez's players.
Yet again, Shelvey shuffled out of the ground refusing to speak.
So too did captain Jamaal Lascelles, who also had a forgettable afternoon.
There were mistakes all over the pitch, and Benitez – who had been proud of his players' efforts against Leeds United on Good Friday – told of his “concern” after the match.
United's supporters are also concerned.
Their team was convincingly beaten by Ipswich, a side which had gone into the match still needing points to secure their Championship status.
Benitez had made five changes to the team which was held to a 1-1 draw by Leeds.
Former Ipswich striker Daryl Murphy was recalled to the starting XI along with DeAndre Yedlin, Grant Hanley, Mohamed Diame and Christian Atsu.
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy had admitted before the game that his team had “missed” Murphy, signed on a two-year deal last summer. But would Newcastle miss Gayle?
At the back, Chancel Mbemba made way for Grant Hanley, while there was also a start for fit-again DeAndre Yedlin. The team, however, spent the first few minutes on the back foot.
Shelvey, uncharacteristically, was wasteful with possession, and Ipswich delivered a series of balls into United's box, including a dangerous free-kick from Tom Lawrence.
At the other end of the pitch, Murphy and Paul Dummett had half-chances.
Benitez, concerned at what he had seen in the first 20 minutes, used a break in play for treatment to Isaac Hayden to issue instructions to his players, who had lived far too dangerously for his liking.
They had been sloppy with the ball and sluggish out of possession.
Ipswich were sharper. They repeatedly got down the flanks and tested Yedlin and Dummett.
Shelvey twice tested goalkeeper Bartosz Bialkowski in the first half, but Newcastle, for the most part, struggled to create anything meaningful in the final third of the pitch.
They needed more from Shelvey and Diame.
Dummett delivered a good cross for Matt Ritchie late in the half after turning his man, but the winger put his header wide of Bialkowski's goal.
Then it happened. And it had been coming.
Lawrence ran at goal at the other end of the pitch after Ritchie lost the ball. United backed off and at the last moment he slipped to the ball to the unmarked Sears, whose side went in off Hanley.
Newcastle were just fortunate not to be further behind at the break.
The performance didn't immediately improve after the interval, and Benitez replaced Hayden with Yoan Gouffran just past the hour-mark.
Gouffran couldn't get on the end of Atsu's low cross from the left, but Murphy was there to tap the ball home and equalise.
This time, the goal hadn't been coming. But that didn't matter. It came. And United had almost half an hour to find a winner.
But that wasn't how it worked out.
A poor clearance from Darlow led to another Ipswich attack, and eventually Sears rolled the ball across the face of goal to McGoldrick, who tapped the ball home at the far post.
It was another dreadful, and avoidable, goal from United's point of view.
So too was the injury-strike from Emyr Huws which capped a miserable afternoon which was brightened only by Derby's late equaliser against Huddersfield.
Newcastle's Championship fate, thankfully, remains in their own hands.

Scientists at the Universities of Oslo and Liverpool have uncovered the secret behind a goldfish's remarkable ability to produce alcohol as a way of surviving harsh winters beneath frozen lakes.
Humans and most other vertebrate animals die within a few minutes without oxygen. Yet goldfish and their wild relatives, crucian carp, can survive for days, even months, in oxygen-free water at the bottom of ice-covered ponds.
During this time, the fish are able to convert anaerobically produced lactic acid into ethanol, which then diffuses across their gills into the surrounding water and avoids a dangerous build-up of lactic acid in the body.
The molecular mechanism behind this highly unusual ability, which is unique among vertebrates and more commonly associated with brewer's yeast, has now been uncovered and is published in the journal Scientific Reports.
The international team has shown that muscles of goldfish and crucian carp contain not just the usual one, but two sets of the proteins normally used to channel carbohydrates towards their breakdown within a cell's mitochondria – a key step for energy production.
While one set of these proteins appears very similar to that in other species, the second set is strongly activated by the absence of oxygen and shows a mutation that allows channelling of metabolic substrates to ethanol formation outside the mitochondria.
Further genetic analyses suggest that the two sets of proteins arose as part of a whole genome duplication event in a common ancestor of goldfish and crucian carp some 8 million years ago.
Dr Michael Berenbrink, an evolutionary physiologist at the University of Liverpool, said: “During their time in oxygen-free water in ice-covered ponds, which can last for several months in their northern European habitat, blood alcohol concentrations in crucian carp can reach more than 50 mg per 100 millilitres, which is above the drink drive limit in these countries.
“However, this is still a much better situation than filling up with lactic acid, which is the metabolic end product for other vertebrates, including humans, when devoid of oxygen.”
Lead author Dr Cathrine Elisabeth Fagernes, from the University of Oslo, said: “This research emphasises the role of whole genome duplications in the evolution of biological novelty and the adaptation of species to previously inhospitable environments.
“The ethanol production allows the crucian carp to be the only fish species surviving and exploiting these harsh environments, thereby avoiding competition and escaping predation by other fish species with which they normally interact in better oxygenated waters.
“It's no wonder then that the crucian carp's cousin the goldfish is arguably one of the most resilient pets under human care.”
Give John Ward credit. At least he did not say that some of his best friends are Puerto Ricans. What this Boston Brahmin wannabe and recent Florida transplant trying to buy himself a congressional seat here did say is revolting enough. But again, in fairness to Ward, he does not seem to know what the word “democratic” means, let alone what Puerto Rico's place in our democracy happens to be. He's not the first. Which makes him an ideal candidate for Congress in these days of re-emerging discrimination and selective supremacy.
Ward is one of three Republicans running for the 6th congressional district seat nominally held by Ron DeSantis since 2013. The district includes all of Flagler and parts of Volusia and St. Johns. Ward, a businessman who inherited his father's wealth–“I stand with Trump,” Ward says with experience–was appearing alongside Fred Costello, another candidate, at a small forum hosted by a Mount Dora Republican Club last week when a man in the audience asked the candidates this question: “A lot of Puerto Ricans have moved either temporarily or permanently to Florida. How do you respond to them when they say that they need more help and that the aid to Puerto Rico is not enough?”
Ward never quite answered the question. Not the aid part, anyway. What he did say amounted to what he said in a rejoinder to Costello later: “I want to get ‘em home.” But before he got there he gave us a tour of his bigotry, ignorance, contempt, pompousness, and back to bigotry. Here's his answer in full:
“So, first of all I don't think they should be allowed to register to vote. And you know it's not lost on me that I think the Democrat [sic.] Party's really hoping that they can change how the voting registers in a lot of the counties in the district and I don't think they should be allowed to do that. Secondly, I've a good friend who actually runs Tote Maritime, which is one of the largest shipping concerns that runs the route here from up in Jacksonville, over to Puerto Rico, so I get pretty current updates on what's going on in Puerto Rico. I think the situation is improving a lot there, and where I'm going with that comment is, we should be looking to put the Puerto Ricans back in their homes, right? So the idea that they can come to the mainland United States, I don't necessarily have a problem with that, but I think we should be thinking about it in terms of getting them back home, and providing the capital and resources to rebuild Puerto Rico, which I honestly think is where they belong.”
First off it's not the “Democrat Party.” Republicans since the 1940s have tried to slur Democrats by lobotomizing the word's adjective to make it sound less, well, democratic. Ironic, considering Republicans' infatuation with voter-suppression laws and neo-Black Codes. But as slurs go, that one was among Ward's milder ones.
His opening line was more nakedly offensive: “I don't think they should be allowed to register to vote.” To say this about 3.3 million U.S. citizens requires impressive doses of ignorance and prejudice. True, since Puerto Ricans became citizens in 1917, they've been disenfranchised in every presidential election for living in a territory rather than a state, and the second-class status has been compounded by the mainland continually denying Puerto Rico statehood or representation with voting power in Congress. But just as any American who moves residency to Puerto Rico loses the ability to vote in presidential elections, any Puerto Rican moving residency to one of the 50 states gains it. That's the law. Whether or how new arrivals register is their business. At least Ward doesn't “necessarily have a problem” with them coming to the United States. Up to a point.
Since to Ward all Puerto Ricans seem to look, sound, and vote alike (giving minorities their own individuality as human and thinking beings isn't a reactionary's strong suit, as Roseanne Barr reminded us in her latest 15 seconds of bile), he's assuming that they're all coming to Florida to register as Democrats, because really that's the priority for those who've managed the crossing to get away from Hurricane Maria's devastation. They've lost home, family, job, life. But all along through howls and loss they kept their eyes on the prize: that Democratic registration card at Kaiti Lenhart's office. You can tell from the moist marks of naked Latino feet fraying carpet since September, obviously.
But let's assume “they” were doing exactly that. In what way are Puerto Rican migrants to Florida different from, say, migrants from Oklahoma, Alabama, New York, or, like Ward himself, Acton, Massachusetts? Would Ward tell his snow-weary neighbors from Massachusetts who decide to make the move to Florida to go home once they've had a few days in the sun? Would he tell Hawaiian volcano victims or California wildfire escapees to go back where they belong after a while? Would he discourage anyone moving from anywhere in the United States to start a life in Florida? Judge their motives? Demean their rights? Question their politics? Of course not.
Unless they're Puerto Ricans. Because they don't “belong” here. They “belong” in Puerto Rico. Ward's own word. In 2018 Florida.
For a moment there I really thought I was hearing those imbecilic nativists who thought during Reconstruction that they could “repatriate” freed slaves back to Africa, which, to quote Ward repeating their exact words from a century and a half ago, “I honestly think is where they belong.” The bigotry is the same, down to that supremacist language and the fear of the ballot in more bronzed hands.
Costello posted the video of the exchange. But he wasn't much better–not just with his version of contempt–“Do I want them coming here and registering Democart? Of course not”–but with his vile and misinformed judgments about Puerto Ricans' motives as driven not by escaping ruin, not by their ambition and ability to enrich Florida, but their implied predisposition to leech off the system: “Now, where I draw the line is government should not be paying them to continue to live off of government. If they want to move here and get jobs and live here, fine.” I wonder how many Flagler voters he'd insult that way for receiving a FEMA check, a Medicare subsidy, a mortgage-interest deduction, all three of which Costello or his family likely benefit from firsthand.
Costello was race-baiting just as much as Ward was. He just did it more slickly, tactically dropping his code words the way a guy who's been around politics for many years knows how.
What neither of these men did was unreservedly and unconditionally speak of Puerto Ricans the way they'd speak of their white-skinned, proudly English-only neighbors in Ormond Beach or Ponte Vedra Beach, Ward's alleged home (he doesn't actually live in the district he's running for). Just as strikingly, only one person in the audience of perhaps two dozen at the Ward and Costello show–an attorney who studied in Puerto Rico–called them out.
Beyond that, some articles, some calls for Ward (and only Ward) to quit his campaign, but not much else. No serious outcry, at least not yet. No groups cancelling their Ward invitations, certainly no denunciations by his party. No surprise, either. For Republicans in the Age of Trump, it's bigotry as usual. And from Ward? “I stand by what I said.”
So much for welcoming our new neighbors from Puerto Rico, whose numbers thankfully add to our previous neighbors from the island, in Palm Coast especially: this town would be even more insipid than it is without its Latin and other-colored migrants. And now that men like Costello and Ward have made their caste systems clear, I do hope that as many of the recent arrivals to the 6th Congressional District register and act Democratic, in every sense of the term: their vote could be the difference in a disturbingly toxic region where too many of us, not just Puerto Ricans, are made to feel like we don't belong.

ISLAMABAD, Aug.14 (APP):The High Commission of Pakistan in Sri Lanka and
the Pakistani community has celebrated 70th Independence Anniversary of Pakistan in a
befitting manner.
According to a message recieved here from Sri Lanka on Monday, the
Acting High Commissioner of Pakistan in Sri Lanka, Dr. Sarfraz Ahmed Khan Sipra hoisted
the national flag of Pakistan at a colorful ceremony held at the Pakistan High Commission
here is this morning to mark the occasion.
Later, the messages of the President and Prime Minister of Pakistan were
read out to the participants.
In his message, the Acting High Commissioner Dr. Sarfraz Sipra said that
Pakistan was our identity that we earned through immense sacrifices.
He underlined that countless people gave their blood to kindle the light
of freedom and millions had to migrate for this purpose.
It was a day of happiness and a day of renewing our pledges that we would
continue to struggle with unity and oneness for the objectives for which Pakistan was
created, he added.
On Sri Lanka-Pakistan relations, Dr. Sipra said that it was a matter of great
satisfaction that Pakistan and Sri Lanka continued to maintain their traditionally close and
mutually beneficial relations in all fields.
“The process of bilateral cooperation has been greatly assisted by ever
increasing multifaceted interaction both at the level of people and leaders of our two
countries.”
He lauded that the two countries had achieved development, progress and

Resurfacing works to a major route in Bristol are likely to cause big delays - including those heading to and leaving Bristol Airport.
North Somerset council is warning motorists it is resurfacing a section of the A38 near Bristol Airport across the weekend of Saturday July 7 and Sunday July 8.
The surface dressing will be carried out on a six-kilometre stretch of the A38 between the South Bristol Link Road and the junction with Downside Road.
It will be carried out from 5am to 12pm on both days. Traffic heading out of Bristol towards the airport during these hours will be diverted along South Bristol Link Road, A370 and Brockley Combe.
Outside these hours, the A38 will fully re-open.
“The council's surface dressing programme is part of our long-term commitment to investing in our roads,” said Cllr Elfan Ap Rees, executive member with responsibility for roads.
“Treating roads in this way prevents them from getting any worse and needing a much more expensive repair in the future.
“We are working closely with Bristol Airport to ensure their passengers and staff are aware of the need to allow extra travelling time.”
Drivers are urged to be patient and to allow extra journey time.
Surface dressing is a road treatment that extends the life of a road, protects it from water damage and enhances the skid resistance of the road surface improving road safety.
North Somerset Council carry out surface dressing where the structure of the road is sound but the surface has started to deteriorate. The works are carried out during the summer months when there are more hours of daylight available to enable the new surface to set correctly.

MIRPUR (AJK)-The Kashmir-origin member of the British Parliament Ms Naz Shah has called for early grant of the right to self-determination to the people of Jammu and Kashmir to let them decide their destiny and pave the way for early peaceful solution to the Kashmir issue.
“Solution to Kashmir issue is the key to emergence of everlasting peace in South Asia in general and the world-over in particular as it involves two nuclear arch rivals.”
Naz, a lawmaker in lower house - the House of Commons, belongs to the opposition Labour Party from Bradford, expressed the views while speaking at a reception hosted in her honour.
Dr Amin Chaudhry, Chairman Professional Board of PML-N AJK and Chairman Jinnah Foundation JK hosted the reception, which was also attended by members a British Parliamentary delegation.
AJK minister for Sports and Culture Ch Muhammad Saeed chaired the ceremony which was also addressed among others by the chair, Kashmir-born Councillor from Bradford City Council Chaudhry Arshad Hussain, MDA Director General Ch Ejaz Raza and senior Kashmiri journalist Altaf Hamid Rao. The speakers called for a more vibrant role of the UK-based Kashmiri Diaspora to muster maximum sympathies of the international community and raise importance of early settlement of Kashmir issue.
The seven-member British Delegation is currently on a visit of Azad Jammu & Kashmir on the invitation of the AJK President Sardar Masood Khan to apprise them of the critical conditions prevailed in Indian occupied Jammu & Kashmir following the massacre of the freedom-loving people in the occupied valley by the Indian occupational forces since past 70 years in general and last 28 years in particular.
Speaking on the occasion, Naz Shah urged that the legitimate right of the people of Jammu & Kashmir is already acknowledged by the international community through the UN resolutions – which guarantee the right of the people of the Himalayan state to decide about their future through a free and fair plebiscite under the auspices of the UN, she recalled.
Expressing grave concern over the continued human rights abuses in Indian-occupied Jammu & Kashmir, the British MP emphasized immediate grant of justice to the people of occupied Jammu & Kashmir through early peaceful settlement of the Kashmir issue under the spirit of the international norms and commitments.
She said that 70-year-old Kashmir issue should be settled through just and principled manner in line with the wishes of the basic stakeholders – the people of Jammu & Kashmir.
Describing Kashmir as one of the major global issues of human rights violation, the British MP called for the early peaceful settlement of Kashmir issue through political means.
She underlined that since Kashmir issue is virtually becoming threat to the regional and rather global peace, the same should immediately be resolved according to the wishes of the Kashmiri people for the emergence of permanent and durable peace in South Asia.
The speakers said that by acknowledging Kashmir issue as threat to the regional and global peace, the international community including Britain should perform their due global obligations for ensuring early peaceful solution of this much delayed dispute through a composite dialogue between India and Pakistan through the involvement of the recognized leadership of Jammu Kashmir people from both sides of the Line of Control. They said that under the same spirit, the human rights loving British Parliamentarian including over a dozen Pakistan and Kashmir origin members of the British Parliament always considered Kashmir as the high profile issue by offering effective role for the peaceful resolution acceptable to all the three stakeholders including Pakistan, India and the Kashmiris.
Expressing strong reaction over the increased human rights abuses in Indian held valley, speakers sought immediate intervention of the international organisations of human rights for getting the Indian state terrorism stopped.
They underlined that despite the continued coercive tactics by the Indian occupational forces in occupied Jammu and Kashmir, the valiant Kashmiris have totally rejected the forced Indian rule over their motherland and are determined to get liberation from the Indian slavery.

Oxford County broke ground on its new waste management administration building Thursday.
As politicians and staff looked on at the county's waste management facility in Salford, a yellow excavator ripped into the soil where the new net-zero structure will be built.
The more than $1.8-million project will boast state-of-the-art construction methods and energy efficiency, using solar panels and an efficient building envelope to completely offset energy use by the facility and the landfill site. It's slated for completion in March.
County warden David Mayberry hailed the project as a "symbol of the (county's) forward thinking."
"We know that for a variety of reasons, like climate change, that we need to change the direction that the world is going," he said. "County council has recognized that and said that we see where we need to go... and we're prepared to go there."
Mayberry said the structure also will be a "learning living laboratory," that school groups can visit to learn more about what's being done at the landfill.
"This will probably be our last landfill," he added. "As you look forward... we'll have to greatly reduce the amount of waste we produce. We're looking at how do we capture all of the resources out of it and then minimize what we can't capture easily."
Chief administrator Peter Crockett said the new facility epitomizes the county's waste-reduction efforts.
"It will be a showcase for all of the technologies and actions being done in zero waste," Crockett said. "The building itself will... show what building technology can look like... (and) at the same time, it will be a functional operation for our landfill."

Greetings Muezzin:
My spring project is to try and measure the verve and elan with which my special concoctions are exiting the muzzle. Have searched the archives and my own library and haven't really found a discussion on the subject.
Several pictures I have seen show a chronograph firmly ensconced in a heavy timber fortification. I was thinking more along the lines of a couple of pieces of sheet metal bolted to the bar in front of the sky screens. Sooo, I thought I would come to the well of all wisdom before I start destroying expensive electronics.
Also wondering about distance from the muzzle, calibrating with factory loads etc. What would you think of doing a little dissertation on the ins and outs of your technique for chronographing shotshells, for the benefit of the great unwashed.
Best
Bill
Dear Bill,
You mean you want me to soft soap the great unwashed? To tell the truth, I never really thought much about chrongraphing techniques. I just got a yard stick and measured three feet from the muzzle to the CENTER of my chrongraph's screens and let ‘er rip five times, ten if I was feeling flush that week.
You can get down range velocity from the tables in Lymans reloading handbook. that's the easy way. If you simply must, you can also chronograph down range velocities by putting a piece of 3/4″ plywood in front the chronograph with a strategically cut 2″ hole which will permit any pellets which pass through the hole to go directly over the skyscreens. Make sure to always measure with a tape measure from muzzle to the center between the two sky screens. Pacing off or guesstimating really won't cut it in the world of aspiring Junior Technoids.
When testing for three foot muzzle velocity, I never bothered to tie my chronograph down or protect the front in any way. Muzzle blast never moved it and the LED display never got messed up with burnt powder. I guess that if you wanted to be safe, you could duct tape it to a stand or table and put a piece of clear plexiglass over the LED display on the front.
Calibrating against factory loads has its downside. If you shoot a certain factory load in matches and want your reloads to equal it exactly, then by all means test the factory load and match the reloads to it. On the other hand, never assume that factory loads of a certain dram equivalent will be dead on the nominal velocity. They seldom are. Watch out for consistency with factory shells also. 25 fps variation is not unusual. Some match quality .22 rimfire cartridges are consistent enough to set your chronograph with, but no shotshell is.
I wish that it were more involved so that I could awe the populace with my expertise, but it isn't and I can't. Even if it was, I couldn't. The muezzin just calls 'em in. He doesn't make the rules.
Best regards,
Bruce Buck

LAHORE - PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has said that dictator General Ziaul Haq promoted the culture of intolerance in society which keeps haunting the country even today.
“I want to see a Pakistan which has a culture of tolerance and love for humanity,” he said while addressing the participants of three-day Benazir Literary Festival at Alhamra Hall.
The festival kicked off with the screening of a documentary movie "Awaz-e-Jamhur". It was also attended by Benazir's closest friend, Victoria Schofield. Senator Sherry Rehman, Qamar Zaman Kaira, Shehla Raza, Wosattullah Khan and Hassan Jafar Zaidi were among the other prominent personalities at the inaugural ceremony.
He lamented that the current atmosphere in the country was that of hatred and intolerance and it was because the former dictator killed the culture of tolerance and the right to raise questions.
“Such festivals spread a message of love and tolerance in society,” he observed. He said a great leader was like a great artist who touched the hearts and souls of the people. A leader binds people together, he added. Bilawal said his mother also did the same by uniting the country. He believed that the artists and the politicians had the same function of reforming the society in a big way.
He said her mother Benazir Bhutto opted to land in Lahore after ending her exile to lead a democratic struggle against the Marshal law. “My mother was accorded a splendid welcome on her arrival here,“ he said, adding that Lahore was the most favorite city of his mother.
He said Lahore was city of artists which had been the abode of great poets like Iqbal, Jalib and Intizar Hussain. Art, culture and history run into the veins of Lahore culture,” he said.
Participants also observed one minutes silence for the Wali Khan University student Mishal Khan who was allegedly lynched to death on charges of blasphemy last week.
Sonoma's new honorary mayor
Posted on February 2, 2018 by Sonoma Valley Sun
Marcelo Defreitas, president of the Board of Directors for La Luz, is Sonoma's Honorary Alcalde for 2018, the City's annual honor for community service and leadership.
The tradition began in 1975 when the City Council established the Honorary Alcalde (the Spanish word for Mayor) as a means of recognizing individuals in the community who had made unselfish contributions to the welfare of Sonoma.
Last year's honorees were Ted and Pat Eliot. (See complete list below).
In addition to his work for La Luz, Defreitas has been instrumental in raising funds for many local non-profits including the Sonoma Valley Museum of Art, Jack London State Park, Lyon Ranch, and Sonoma Valley Fund.
Defreitas grew up on a cattle ranch Brazil. He studies Public Relations in college, and began work doing public relations at the largest publishing company in South America.
In 1984, he moved to San Francisco to finish his degree and to learn English. He finished his studies at the University of San Francisco and got a bachelor's in fine art from The Academy of Art.
In 1988, he joined Primo Angeli Inc., the noted packaging design company, as a junior designer. He stayed at Primo Angeli until 1999 having been promoted to art director. There, he worked for several prominent clients including Nestle, Intel, Safeway, Sutter Home, as well as European and Latin American clients. He also taught graphic design at the Academy of Art University.
Defreitas moved to Sonoma in 1999. He joined the La Luz board in 2011.
The City of Sonoma will host a reception in Defreitas' honor in the near future. Details of the reception will be announced at a later date.

It is going to be the first Monday Night Raw of the new year and it is shaping up to be a really big one as WWE builds toward the Royal Rumble. A number of feuds from 2016 are continuing over into 2017 with some interesting new title feuds being built up as well, but there's something much bigger that the fans are looking forward to. On Raw, Goldberg will return and detail the plans he has for himself and Brock Lesnar. The official website of WWE released their preview for the first Raw of 2017, and they really wanted to start things off with a bang. Having Goldberg appear is going to be huge, but it is possible that some new Royal Rumble participants could be added with the pay-per-view (PPV) just a few weeks away. What does Goldberg have in store? It has been just about a month since Goldberg was last seen on WWE television and that was when he announced he would join the big 30-man match. Now, the world knows that Brock Lesnar is also in the match, but nothing else has been revealed about further entrants or what plans are in store for the two big men already in it. No-one really has any idea what Goldberg is going to do on Monday night or what he may say to the WWE Universe. Maybe, he's going to talk about his future in the company or what he plans to do to Brock Lesnar. Maybe, he's ready to address someone else and another superstar will step up to the plate to take him on. If someone else actually gets in the ring to face off with Goldberg, they have bigger ambitions for 2017 than a lot of other people. Can Sami Zayn be the Last Man Standing? WWE is continuing the feud between Braun Strowman and Sami Zayn for some reason even though the big man was booked as a main event monster on Raw a couple of weeks ago. Now, these two will have a Last Man Standing Match that could end in a result that doesn't hurt either one of them. [Image by WWE] It's just odd that this match is going to happen at all after Strowman took out both Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins. Even at house shows, Strowman is destroying Zayn in matches as reported by Wrestling Inc., so, how is a Last Man Standing bout going to change anything? Is Kevin Owens' days numbered? On Jan. 29, Roman Reigns will once again look to capture the WWE Universal Championship when he takes on Kevin Owens at the Royal Rumble. Last week, he held onto his United States Championship by defeating Owens on Raw, but he still wants more and plans on getting it. At the PPV, Owens' best friend Chris Jericho will be locked in a shark cage and hanging high above the ring so he can't interfere. Kevin Owens is all on his own for this match and some fans are worried their worst fears will soon come true. Will Neville earn his crown as “King of the Cruiserweights”? It seems like only a matter of time until Neville ends up capturing the Cruiserweight Championship on Raw. He already has one non-title victory over Rich Swann from last week's 205 Live, and it seems like putting the belt around his waist is just a short waiting game now. What's next for Bayley? Some people may think that Bayley's loss to Charlotte Flair last week is the end of their feud, but it is far from over. With Dana Brooke as the evil referee, it wasn't exactly possible for Bayley to end up with a victory and fans can expect a rematch to be put in place soon, but this time, for the Raw Women's Championship. [Image by WWE] Most likely, that title will be on the line at the Royal Rumble where “The Huggable One” may win her first-ever main roster belt. This week's Monday Night Raw is one that a lot of fans can't wait for, and that is for a number of reasons but two in particular. Yes, the new feuds and the battle over the WWE Universal Championship between Kevin Owens and Roman Reigns are exciting, but there's something bigger. The return to television of Goldberg and the build-up to the always exciting Royal Rumble are leading the pack and opening 2017 in big ways. [Featured Image by WWE]

But for Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, the Trans Mountain expansion represented a historic compromise: Alberta would sign onto Ottawa's climate change agenda; in return the federal government would guarantee the province a new pipeline to get tarsands bitumen to market.
In theory, this compromise seemed doable. In practice, it was not. It didn't speak to the real concerns of pipeline opponents. It still doesn't.
The only difference now is that pipeline critics will be demonstrating against a federal Crown corporation rather than a privately owned U.S. company.
But the real weakness in Ottawa's nationalization scheme is economic. The Trans Mountain expansion was conceived at a time when petroleum prices were hitting record highs and before shale oil had become an important source of energy.
In those heady days, it made some economic sense to build a pipeline devoted to developing Alberta's high-cost oilsands for export. Now it makes less sense.
Companies that have already invested heavily in the oilsands will continue to mine bitumen at almost any price in an effort to offset their fixed costs. But new investors are warier.
What's more, as Alberta's Parkland Institute points out, the Trans Mountain expansion was conceived at a time when there were fewer pipelines bringing tarsands oil to market. Since then, the Keystone XL pipeline, which is meant to take heavy oil from Alberta to Texas, has been approved.
The ultimate cost of the federal government's new pipeline scheme remains unclear. The $4.5 billion price tag cited by Morneau on Tuesday covers only the cost of purchasing Kinder Morgan's existing assets. The planned expansion was expected to cost the Texas-based company $7.4 billion more.
Presumably, the cost to the new owners — us — will be about the same.
The Alberta government may also be called on to pony up an unspecified amount of money, Morneau said.
The finance minister said he plans to reprivatize the pipeline company as soon as possible. We shall see if that works out.
In all of this, the federal government's assumption appears to be that the obstacles facing Trans Mountain are transitory — that all Ottawa need do is guide the project through a rough patch.
In fact, the problems facing pipelines today are much deeper. Kinder Morgan found that out the hard way. The federal Liberal government and its new Crown corporation are on track to be taught the same lesson.

The legacy Lady Flo left behind her in the regions Tobi Loftus Full Profile Login to follow
THE South Burnett would not be the place it is today without the influence of Lady Florence Bjelke- Petersen and Sir Joh Bjelke- Petersen, according the South Burnett deputy mayor Kathy Duff.
"They both really did a lot for this region," Cr Duff said.
She said during his time as Premier, Sir Joh was known as a leader who got things built in the regions.
"The Bjelke-Petersen Dam, the railway extension in the South Burnett, the Kingaroy and Wondai airports; those are just a
few things Sir Joh did," she said.
"He also did a lot of work at Cherbourg, helping to get Murgon and Cherbourg working well together."
She said Sir Joh and Lady Flo put Kingaroy on the map.
"Wherever you go in Australia if you say you come from Kingaroy, people know that is where the Bjelke-Petersens are from," she said.
"Without the Bjelke- Petersen family, Kingaroy and the South Burnett would be a lot poorer a place and a lot less known."
Kathy Duff with Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Contributed
Cr Duff also worked closely with both Sir Joh and Lady Flo in her role as the Barambah Electorate Council secretary.
"It involved doing the secretarial work for the electorate council, which was very busy as we had the Premier as the member," she said.
"That's how I got started in my interest in politics, because of Sir Joh.
"I was also heavily involved in the Young Nationals in Kingaroy."
Cr Duff said she was saddened when she heard of Lady Flo's death.
"As far as Lady Flo goes, she was an inspiration and role model to women of all ages," she said.
"As a senator she led by example, she had a faultless loyalty and dedication to her work.
"She was also kind and caring, she remembered people's names. She was strong and forthright. She crossed the floor in Parliament to stand up for what she believed in. She had a no-fuss approach to everything."
The Bjelke-Petersen Dam was named after the family. Heath Pukallus
She said one of her fondest memories was watching Lady Flo give a speech at a school.
"She went to a function at a school and made a speech, told a story about her life and at the end she said it is nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice," she said.
"She was no fuss, that was her style."
Cr Duff said this inspired her.
"I absolutely admired them both, they inspired everybody in our region," she said.
"I was just so fortunate to have an association with the Bjelke-Petersen family."
Cr Duff said the last time she had seen Lady Flo was at the opening of the community hospital named in her honour.
"Sir Joh and Lady Flo were just always very supportive of rural communities," she said.
"I honestly think they did an amazing amount of things for our area."
Personal connection to hospital
WHILE Lady Flo will forever be remembered for her pumpkin scones, her name will live on at the Lady Florence Bjelke- Petersen Community Hospital in Kingaroy.
When the name of the refurbished community hospital was announced in 2016, Lady Flo said the hospital meant a great deal to her because it was where she had given birth to her children.
"I feel it's a great honour," Lady Flo said at the time.
"I have shared a lot with that hospital in my time.
"It's very thoughtful of them and I want them to know I appreciate it very much."
John Bjelke-Petersen said in 2016 he was proud of the hospital and the contribution it had made to the community over the years.
"Dad was there for the last few days of his life," Mr Bjelke-Petersen said.
"Staff have always been great and we've always appreciated that hospital."
LADY BJELKE-PETERSEN HOSPITAL OPENING: Lady Flo. Rhiannon Tuffield
Former South Burnett mayor Wayne Kratzmann said naming the hospital after Lady Flo would help the community feel connected to the council- owned facility.
"We wanted to name it after somebody and our most famous resident is Lady Flo so we never gave any thought for anybody else," he said in 2016.
The hospital is just one of many places in the region named after members of the Bjelke-Petersen family.
Deputy mayor Kathy Duff said the naming of various places recognised the impact of the Bjelke- Petersens on the region.
"We recognise them through the naming of different structures and parks," Cr Duff said.
"In Kingaroy there is the Bjelke-Petersen Park, in Murgon there is Lady Bjelke-Petersen Place.
"In Kingaroy there is the Lady Florence Bjelke- Petersen Community Hospital.
"There are numerous buildings named after Sir Joh, honouring the family's memory and their legacy of building things, progressing our region and progressing Queensland."
One of the more well- known regional landmarks named after the family is the Bjelke-Petersen Dam near Murgon, which Sir Joh's government helped to construct.
"Sir Joh was known for building dams," Cr Duff said.

Namesake a blooming honour
SHE was known for her vibrant personality and colourful spirit but the colours of Lady Flo had never been quite so purple.
Lady Flo Bjelke-Petersen is a household name but who knew it was also a household flower?
Wondai garden enthusiast Dell Beers featured the exotic, purple hibiscus in her garden but worried the flower did not have the fame it deserved.
"I hadn't heard of the Lady Flo before but they showed me a picture and I was sold," Mrs Beers said in 2015.
Mrs Beers said she used to go to the Wondai garden festival and buy the most exotic and different looking flowers.
"It's very delicate and feminine," she said.
She said the colour of the Lady Flo shone through between a muddle of other hibiscus in her front garden.
"It wouldn't really matter what colour it was, it's special because of the name," Mrs Beers said.
"Any flower would be lovely named after Lady Flo."
Lady Flo said she was not lucky enough to grow the purple hibiscus in her own garden at Orana but was happy other people could enjoy it.
"It's pretty, and I think it's quite an honour to have such a beautiful flower named after me," Lady Flo said.

Flo could make scones with 'eyes closed'
PUMPKIN scones are undoubtedly Florence Bjelke-Petersen's major claim to fame.
Before she started her family, Lady Flo, as she was affectionately known, admitted she hadn't had much experience in the kitchen.
But with a bit of practice she became more than a proficient cook and released a book with 500 recipes including her personal favourites, pumpkin scones and sponge cake.
"I could make sponge cake and scones with my eyes closed," Mrs Bjelke-Petersen said.
But after Lady Flo gained office as a Queensland Senator, cooking became a bit of a chore.
She was elected at the 1980 federal election, serving for 12 years from 1981-1993 and she was well liked among other politicians, the people and the media.
"I was privileged to represent the people of Queensland for such a long time," she said. "I enjoyed the opportunity and I was actually very surprised when I got in."
Perhaps Lady Flo's popularity among the people could be attributed to her down-to-earth and charitable nature, despite being the wife of the premier. "I was very approachable and people felt comfortable coming to me with any problems they needed help with," she said.
But she was also a pioneer among women, being one of few female members of the Senate in the 1980s and 1990s.
"You had a responsibility to represent women in politics because there weren't as many women in parliament as there are today," she said.
Today, with hip-hop having surpassed rock as the most popular music genre, its independent media tastemakers have experienced a commensurate rise in popularity. This is partially due to the social media savvy and innate self-promotional streak of its stars, but it's also a byproduct of the whims of fans. For every Lil Yachty or Post Malone that comes up squarely within the confines of the major label system, there is a Tay-K or 6ix9ine, Soundcloud superstars, whose court cases and controversies fuel their meteoric rise but who are often treated as persona non grata by mainstream publications.

Virgin Holidays has announced its latest airport lounge, 'The Departure Beach', a branded beach facility in Barbados designed to maximise the last day abroad for holidaymakers.
The branded lounge will be situated on Brownes Beach in Barbados, and intends to ensure that Virgin Holiday customers are enjoying their holidays up until the moment they have to leave.
Guests will be able to enjoy a beach-friendly bar and restaurant, a private air-conditioned lounge, premium bathroom and showering facilities before they head to the Virgin check-in desk, which is located on the beach.
A Virgin Holiday transfer will pick holidaymakers up from their hotel after breakfast, and will also take their hold luggage straight to the airport. Guests at the lounge will be able to relax at the beach, take a last dip in the ocean and enjoy a free lunch. A kids gaming area and complimentary wi-fi will also be available.
Nicki Goldsmith, head of the Caribbean and worldwide product at Virgin Holidays, said: "Virgin Holidays has consistently launched ‘world-first' concepts, and this latest innovation is no different. We believe that a holiday should be a pleasure from beginning to end and have been working hard to ensure we've removed as many pain points as possible for our customers. We can't wait to launch this very exciting development next year, and hope our customers are as excited about it as we are."
Cheryl Carter, UK director of Barbados Tourism Marketing, said: "Virgin Holidays is the largest British tour operator to Barbados with daily Virgin Atlantic flights departing from London Gatwick and multiple flights each week from Manchester and London Heathrow. We're thrilled that they've chosen Barbados to pioneer such a revolutionary concept – and as it's situated on one of the most picturesque beaches on the island why would you choose to waste that last day of your holiday?"
In December, Virgin Holidays launched its immersive v-room at Gatwick Airport's North Terminal.

Reid Carruthers will play in the provincial men's championship final for the second year in a row.
Carruthers and his squad from the West St. Paul Curling Club defeated a Mike McEwen-less Team McEwen 7-3 in Saturday night's 1-vs-1 Page Playoff game at the Viterra Championship in Winkler. McEwen hasn't played since Wednesday after being hospitalized with chicken pox as BJ Neufeld, Matt Wozniak and Denni Neufeld continue to play as a 3-man squad.
After a deuce in the second end Carruthers stole a pair in the fourth end for a commanding 4-1 lead. Carruthers added another deuce in the seventh and stole a single point in the eighth end as he advanced to the provincial final for the fifth time in the last six years. (Two with Jeff Stoughton, three as a skip)
It was the fourth straight year these two teams met in the 1-vs-1 Page Playoff game,

The two-time defending champion McEwen team will now have to go through the semifinal if they're to qualify for a fifth straight provincial final.
Team McEwen will take on Manitoba junior champion JT Ryan in Sunday morning's semifinal. Ryan's club from the Assiniboine Memorial Curling Club eliminated Brandon's Steve Irwin in the other Page Playoff game with a 5-3 win.
It's the second time in the last three years Manitoba's reigning junior champ has qualified for the provincial men's semifinal after Matt Dunstone beat Carruthers in the 2016 semi's.
The semifinal will be played at 8:30 am on Sunday followed by the championship game at 3:00 pm at the Winkler Arena.

"While Phil Bredesen was in the governor's office, the number of Tennesseans on unemployment nearly doubled."
The U.S. Senate race in Tennessee is starting to heat up. Phil Bredesen, the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination, lofted an ad touting his accomplishments as governor. The Tennessee Republican Party fired back that on jobs, Bredesen's track record wasn't so rosy.
"While Phil Bredesen was in the governor's office, the number of Tennesseans on unemployment nearly doubled," the GOP posted on its website May 23. "He is backtracking to change his weak record, but Tennesseans won't be fooled by misleading ads."
The post included numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to back up the claim.
When Bredesen became governor in January 2003, the state had about 149,000 unemployed people. When he left in January 2011, it had about 296,000.
As the Republicans said, that's about double.
Before we get into the caveats, we should note that there's a flaw in the Republican language. The post talked about "the number of Tennesseans on unemployment." That's different from the number of unemployed people, because some might not have been eligible for unemployment benefits in the first place, and some might have seen their benefits run out.
The state labor market reports track the number of new claims for unemployment each month, but not the total number of people getting benefits at a given point in time.
As for the point about unemployment growth, the Republican post leaves out the enormous impact of the Great Recession. That wasn't something under Bredesen's control; it was a global economic collapse that struck every state and pretty much every nation worldwide.
In the time Bredesen was in office, the national unemployment rate went from 5.8 percent to 9.1 percent. The rate in Tennessee went from 5.1 percent to 9.5 percent; worse than the national average, but the overall trend was the same.
This chart shows shifts in the unemployment rate under Bredesen.
The GOP post also overlooks that before the recession, Bredesen oversaw a net increase in jobs. The state had 2.76 million jobs when he took office, and four years later in 2007, it had 2.94 million, a gain of about 180,000 jobs.
Even as the automobile sales were falling in 2008, on Bredesen's watch, Volkswagen committed to building a new plant outside Chattanooga, Tenn., a move that ultimately created 2,000 new jobs.
Our ruling
The Tennessee Republican Party challenged Bredesen's track record on jobs, saying that the number of people on unemployment doubled during his time as governor.
Government statistics show that the number of unemployed did rise by that amount. But the statement suffers from two flaws: It ignores the impact of the Great Recession which was beyond the control of Bredesen or any state leader. And it assumes that every unemployed person is getting unemployment benefits, which is not accurate.
The numbers leave out important context. We rate the statement Half True.
TORONTO - Elina Svitolina crushed Caroline Wozniacki 6-4, 6-0 to win the Toronto WTA trophy on Sunday, capturing her fifth title of 2017 and her second final of the season over the former world number one. Fifth seed Svitolina, of Ukraine, needed just 77 minutes to beat Wozniacki, blasting four aces and winning the final eight games of the hardcourt match.
She kept the sixth seed at bay with precision groundstrokes that had Wozniacki scurrying around the court to stay in the rallies. "It has been amazing. The title's very special for me and I am very happy that it could happen here," said the 22-year-old Ukrainian who earned $502,000 for the victory.
Svitolina's road to the final included wins over four top ten players. She had a straight-sets demolition of 37-year-old Venus Williams and wins over fourth seeded Garbine Muguruza and second seed Simona Halep.
She has now won all the finals she has played this season, comprising Toronto, Dubai, Istanbul, Taiwan and Rome. She became the first Ukrainian to reach the Top 10 in the WTA rankings by capturing the Dubai title in February where she beat Wozniacki. Svitolina, who has a career record of 9-2 in finals, hammered 15 winners and won 63 points compared to just 43 for Wozniacki.
While Svitolina has been perfect in finals this year, Wozniacki has lost six consecutive finals and seven straight dating back to last season. "Hopefully I will get another chance to get the trophy," Wozniacki said. Wozniacki got off to a decent start in the opening set but serving at 4-4 she double faulted at 0-40 to give Svitolina a 5-4 lead.
That proved to be the turning point as Svitolina held served to take the set then cruised through the second set in just 31 minutes. Svitolina, who dropped just one set en route to the title, will rise to No. 4 in the world rankings on Monday. After finishing 2016 at number 19 in the world, Wozniacki put together a string of victories and is back up to No. 6.
WASHINGTON: A top aide to President-elect Donald Trump said in an interview aired on Sunday that the White House may have disproportionately punished Russia by ordering the expulsion of 35 suspected Russian spies.
Incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on ABC's "This Week" that Trump will be asking questions of US intelligence agencies after President Barack Obama imposed sanctions last week on two Russian intelligence agencies over what he said was their involvement in hacking political groups in the 2016 US presidential election. Obama also ordered Russia to vacate two US facilities as part of the tough sanctions on Russia.
"One of the questions that we have is why the magnitude of this? I mean you look at 35 people being expelled, two sites being closed down, the question is, is that response in proportion to the actions taken? Maybe it was; maybe it wasn't but you have to think about that," Spicer said.
Trump is to have briefings with intelligence agencies this week after he returns to New York on Sunday.
On Saturday, Trump expressed continued skepticism over whether Russia was responsible for computer hacks of Democratic Party officials.
"I think it's unfair if we don't know. It could be somebody else. I also know things that other people don't know so we cannot be sure," Trump said.
He said he would disclose some information on the issue on Tuesday or Wednesday, without elaborating. It is unclear if, upon taking office on Jan 20, he would seek to roll back Obama's actions, which mark a post-Cold War low in US-Russian ties.
Spicer said that after China in 2015 seized records of US government employees "no action publicly was taken. Nothing, nothing was taken when millions of people had their private information, including information on security clearances that was shared. Not one thing happened."
"So there is a question about whether there's a political retribution here versus a diplomatic response," he added.
PRESSURE IN CONGRESS
US intelligence agencies say Russia was behind hacks into Democratic Party organizations and operatives before the presidential election. Moscow denies this. US intelligence officials say the Russian cyberattacks aimed to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Republican John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has scheduled a hearing for Thursday on foreign cyber threats and has said that Russia must be made to pay the price for attacks "on our very fundamentals of democracy.
The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said on the same ABC program that Congress would push for an even harsher reprisal against Russia and warned Trump against undoing Obama's sanctions.
"We think that more has to be done. We don't think that frankly the steps that have been taken are enough of a deterrent," said Representative Adam Schiff, a California Democrat. “And you're going to see bipartisan support in Congress for stronger sanctions against Russia."
Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, said on "Fox News Sunday" that Obama's sanctions were not enough.
Russian President Vladimir Putin decided not to expel anyone in retaliation, saying he would consider the actions of Trump when deciding on further steps. Trump, who has repeatedly praised Putin, said the Russian leader was "very smart" for holding back.
Russian diplomats who were expelled by Obama left Washington on Sunday, Russian news agencies reported, citing Russia's embassy.
Sports brand Puma has teamed up with agency Urban Nerds to stage a 24-hour experiential hub, designed as a platform for female empowerment.
The experiential hub forms part of Puma's wider 'Do You' campaign, which aims to support and empower women through sport. Puma launched the 'Do You' campaign in 2016, as a response to a shift in the female consumer mindset, and as a means of showcasing that the only way to truly be yourself is to 'Do You'.

Dogs give their owners an “apology bow” when they have been naughty as they hate isolation, a canine behaviour expert claims.
Your pet hangs his head and puts his tail between his legs because he wants to look submissive to his owners.
Dogs inherited this behaviour from wolves as they ‘crave harmonious integration' and find that ‘neglect or isolation is painful for them', said Nathan Lents.
By using the ‘apology bow' they are telling you that you are the more powerful one and that they have done something wrong.
Dog owners will be all too familiar with the look dogs give when they have chewed up furniture or shoes or knocked something over.
(Photo: Getty)
Professor Lents, a professor of molecular biology at John Jay College in New York, first mentioned it in his book Not so different: Finding Human Nature in Animals.
In a blog post on Psychology Today, he expanded on the idea and said that it is a ‘very interesting phenomenon that goes far beyond the dog-human relationship and actually reveals quite about the nature of communication itself'.
Whilst it may seem a trivial motion it is actually more complex than you might think.
Professor Lents wrote: "Dogs have inherited this behaviour and they will use it after any kind of infraction that results in being punished.
"As social animals, they crave harmonious integration in the group and neglect or isolation is painful for them".
(Photo: Getty)
Professor Lents said that young wolves first display the apology bow when they begin to learn social integration with other wolves.
When a wolf bites too hard during play he is shunned for a time and must approach the group with an apology bow before they are readmitted.
Dogs have inherited this behaviour and when they are too rough with their owners they do exactly the same thing.
Professor Lents wrote: "The head hangs low, panting or smiling stops, eye-contact is avoided, and they literally put their tail between their legs. So which is it - is the wolf (or dog) indicating apology or submission?
"Well, both. This action is a ‘borrowed signal' because it can mean different things in different contexts.
"In a sense, an apology is indeed an expression of submission. Nothing could be more submissive than that. In fact, dominant dogs and wolves rarely issue apologies (just like dominant humans!) and lower-ranking ones must apologize for even the slightest infraction".
Professor Lents said that in humans signals for apologies are less about submission and are more about affiliation, which is why people shake hands after resolving a dispute.
CLAIM
A photographer used sixteen cameras and waited 62 days to capture an image of the full moon above a sunset.
FALSE
RATING
FALSE
ORIGIN
In May 2017, a fantastical image showing the sun and moon between two trees appeared on social media alongside an even more fantastical claim:
A German photographer had fixed 16 camers to get this shot for which he had to wait for 62 days. See the moon and sun together. This can be only seen again in 2035. Enjoy the shot.
Both the image and the accompanying claim are fake. It was originally created by Bess Hamiti and has been online since at least November 2012, when he published it to his Facebook page with a simple one-word message: “sunset.” We reached out to Hamiti to find out how he created the picture; it appears that it was created by adding a moon to a genuine photograph of a sun setting between two trees.
Hamiti's image (right) and the base photograph (left) which was uploaded by “Bessi” to Wikipedia in September 2012 appear to bear out that theory:
The claim about the photographer's technique is spoofing some of the extraordinary measures taken by photographers in order to capture their images. For example,, photographer Alan McFadyen said that he took over 700,000 images over the course of 6 years to capture a shot of a kingfisher's beak piercing the surface of a body of water. Also, a nearly verbatim copy of the claim shared with the photograph of the sun and moon between two trees was also made about footage showing a large cat swiping at a bird:
The Photographer kept 18 cameras for 62 days to take this shot.This is absolute perfection ! @TandonRaveena pic.twitter.com/p4bH8mNkcg — Dinesh Joshi (@dineshjoshi70) April 21, 2016
Although we have not verified the claim about the cat video, it makes more sense when applied to this footage than the tree photograph. The cat is a moving creature that could attack prey at any time or place, meaning that a photographer might need multiple cameras and patience in order to capture a good image. The sun and the moon, on the other hand, are not prone to quick or impromptu movements.
Last but not least: this scene is scientifically impossible to photograph. Although the moon and sun can be spotted in the sky together at the same time, a full moon only occurs when the moon is exactly opposite the sun:
This means that the moon rises just as the sun is setting, and sets just as the sun is rising. This is also the only night in the month when a lunar eclipse can happen. Even so, eclipses normally happen only one full moon out of every six; the other times the Earth's shadow is either too high or too low to touch the moon.
In other words, as every night sky photographer knows, the full moon only rises at sunset and sets at sunrise.

Bring Changes In PM Relief Fund
THE Prime Minister National Relief Fund was constituted by first prime minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in 1948 when the Congress was the most dominating political party in the country. As such, the PMNRF had Congress president as a permanent member of the six-member committee. But with subsequent changes in political scenario, several non-Congress governments have ruled the country. Hence it becomes a practical necessity that constitution of the PMNRF committee may be suitably changed so that the Congress chief may be replaced by the Opposition leader in Lok Sabha. The PMNRF has also place for deputy prime minister, a post that has not been always held. Therefore PMNRF committee should have a Union minister nominated by the PMNRF chairperson who happens to be Prime Minister.

At The Mercy Of Heat
THE sizzling heat around the country in this particularly harsh pre-monsoon season is taking a toll on the people. Temperatures around 45 degrees Celsius have become a new norm across India. The general heatwave periods have steadily increased in the last one decade. The year 2017 was said to be the fourth hottest year ever in the country. The cool air emanating from the seas is being smothered by high humidity in coastal regions drenching people with perspiration. In other regions, hot winds and lack of moisture are pushing mercury to dangerous levels. The absence of rains has worsened the situation in places where, in the past, a drizzle or two usually kept things cool. Some 400 districts in India have had poor rainfall from October 2017 and the people's misery in these districts cannot be expressed in words. The absence of ‘mango showers', barring southern India, has had an insuperable effect on the people. The maddening rise of night temperatures has added to the people's woes. Acute water scarcity has hit the country and people are hard pressed to carry out their daily chores let alone refill their coolers. The overuse of electricity has put much pressure on the power grids and the load shedding in some areas have made people curse their bad luck. Simultaneously, overburdened electric grids are one of the reasons for the poor quality of air. Simmering heat, paucity of potable water, polluted air are a deadly triplet responsible for infectious diseases and much more and the vicious cycle continues. The heat strokes and the direct heatwave casualties are causes of concern. The dehydration caused by sweating has to be taken care of. The authorities should make water tanks available for the water-deprived citizens.
GANAPATHI BHAT, AKOLA
Bloomberg Media announced the name of its built-for- 24-hour news network — TicToc by Bloomberg — which is set to go live next Monday, Dec. 18.
The company is staffing TicToc with a dedicated team of about 50 reporters, overseen by M. Scott Havens, Bloomberg's global head of digital, and Mindy Massucci, who is the editorial lead of TicToc by Bloomberg. The news org touts it as the world's first “social news network”: combining 's global reach and user-generated commentary with the pedigree of Bloomberg's news-reporting expertise.
The network will be available on Twitter at @tictoc (twitter.com/tictoc). TicToc will feature a mix of breaking news content culled from Twitter — curated and verified by Bloomberg — and Bloomberg's own live video reporting. It's a completely separate product from Bloomberg Television, according to the New York-based company.
Bloomberg Media has landed six initial sponsors for TicToc: AT&T, CA Technologies, CME Group, Goldman Sachs, Infiniti, and TD Ameritrade. Each is paying between $1.5 million-$3 million as presenting partners, according to Bloomberg, confirming a report by Axios.

Bloomberg reps declined to provide details of specific programming on TicToc or about the talent and anchors hired for the network.
“In an era when most viewers are choosing immediacy over quality in breaking news, traditional media hasn't kept up,” Bloomberg Media CEO Justin Smith said in May when it announced the partnership with Twitter for the 24-hour news network (a statement that sounded like a mea culpa). “With this new network, we are setting out to reinvent the digital breaking-news experience.”
TicToc is a reference to a “tick-tock” story: journalism jargon for a piece that provides a play-by-play chronology of a deal or event (no relation to Ke$ha's 2010 dance hit “TikTok”). According to Bloomberg, TicToc “conveys the ethos of the product — that it is timely, accurate, relevant, concise and factual.”
For Twitter, TicToc by Bloomberg will be the first 24-hour live network exclusively available on the social platform. Live video has been a big push for Twitter. In Q3 the company announced around 30 new live-streaming partnerships, after previous deals with partners including Major League Baseball, the NFL, Viacom, the WNBA, Live Nation, the PGA, IMG Fashion, and BuzzFeed, which produces the hour-long “AM to DM” morning talk show on Twitter airing weekdays at 10 a.m. ET.
Bloomberg also released a teaser video promoting TicToc's coming launch:

It all started in October 2012 with Arrow, and since then, there have been a whopping 11 seasons of DC superhero television that have aired on The CW network. What started with Oliver Queen's “five years in hell” has expanded into a multiverse that has included speedsters, Kryptonians, and baristas who become demigoddesses.
Some of these seasons have been excellent; sometimes, they may not be as good as the series' best. In this column, we attempt to rank them all, from not-so-best to the very best.
As for what is included: Only shows within the “Arrowverse” executive produced by Greg Berlanti are included here (The Flash, Arrow, Legends of Tomorrow, and Supergirl). So, sorry, no Smallville. Additionally, only shows that first aired on The CW are here, so Supergirl Season 1 and the retroactively Arrowverse-tied NBC season of Constantine are not featured on this list, either.
Also, obvious spoiler warning for anyone who isn't caught up with certain shows or seasons; just skip past the ones you don't want to know details about!
Sunday's win belonged to Jonathan Stewart, as he rushed for over 100 yards for the second time this season and found the end zone three times as the Carolina Panthers came away with a huge 31-24 victory over the Minnesota Vikings.
But there was also a fantastic touchdown play involving Cam Newton and Devin Funchess midway through the third quarter.
Newton dropped back and faced intense pressure. Danielle Hunter and Everson Griffen were on their way, forcing Newton to backpedal. Newton never even reset his feet. After escaping and scrambling backwards, he lobbed the ball up off his back foot, threw across his body and somehow got managedto hit Funchess, who walked into the end zone, giving the Panthers a 21-13 lead.
When asked about that play, Newton had this to say, per Jourdan Rodrigue of The Charlotte Observer.
Newton says on Funchess broken play TD, “I did everything I was told not to do (meaning cross-body throw). Sometimes you just gotta overcome coaching.” — Jourdan Rodrigue (@JourdanRodrigue) December 10, 2017
Cross-body throws typically spell disaster, but in this instance, Newton did what he had to to make a play and it worked out perfect. Sometimes, sheer athletic ability can trump all.
Tight alignment of a company's IT systems with its current strategy can hamper agility in fast-moving markets — unless the right social conditions are in place.

MIT SMR Frontiers This article is part of an MIT SMR initiative exploring how technology is reshaping the practice of management.
In the wake of the global economic downturn, price pressures forced the Chongqing Qianwei Science & Technology Group Co. Ltd., a Chinese shipbuilder headquartered in Chongqing, to reevaluate its business strategy.
For years, as the company focused on diversifying and creating new product lines, it left IT decisions largely up to the managers of its subsidiaries so they could respond nimbly to customer needs. But after the downturn, Qianwei's top executives realized they needed to cut costs, and the company's former distributed approach to IT “proved to be a huge obstacle,” said Zhang Jin, former CEO of Qianwei Group. It was well-aligned with the former strategy but created an obstacle of its own — it seemed to rob Qianwei of its agility.
Qianwei's top executives thus found themselves confronting a frustrating dilemma: They had achieved the kind of IT-business alignment once considered a gold standard, but they had sacrificed something unexpected in the process.
Alignment vs. Agility
We studied the Chinese shipbuilding industry and found experiences like Qianwei's to be surprisingly typical: Too much alignment between IT and current business strategy can hamstring organizational agility. If every IT change ripples through your entire company, no decision can be taken lightly or made without lengthy deliberation. Alignment, in other words, can produce inertia — unless it's accompanied by the right culture and the right norms of communication.
To be sure, closely aligning IT with the rest of a company's strategy can cut costs and improve the ability to collect data, facilitating the creation of early-warning systems and operational dashboards. Well-aligned systems can also enable quick, coordinated adjustments of business processes. That's likely why alignment continues to be a priority for many chief information officers: In 2016, 42% of 490 CIOs in a Society for Information Management survey listed it as a critical concern. But a less regimented approach to corporate IT has its place too. It allows responses to change business and economic conditions that are swift and creative. Sometimes a company needs the harmonic complexity of a classical master like Ludwig van Beethoven, but other times, the quirky improvisations of jazz pianist Thelonious Monk are what's called for.

Here are the winners and losers from the New England Patriots' shocking 27-20 loss to the Miami Dolphins in Week 14 at Hard Rock Stadium.
Winners
Dion Lewis, RB: The Patriots got him involved in the passing game more than they have typically done in 2017. He finished with five carries for 17 yards and five receptions for 50 yards. Like Rex Burkhead, Lewis didn't get many touches. But also like Burkhead, Lewis helped keep the offense afloat at times when it seemed like it might go full Titanic.
Rex Burkhead, RB: Burkhead scored his fifth touchdown in the last three games. He continued to be a solid red zone force and caught the ball out of the backfield well. But he didn't get the ball a whole lot in the dysfunctional offense. He finished with five receptions for 45 yards.
Lawrence Guy, DL: With Alan Branch out due to a knee injury, the Patriots relied heavily on Guy and Malcom Brown in the interior. Even though the Dolphins had a productive running game, it's easy to imagine the Miami would have been even more productive if it weren't for Guy. He nearly intercepted the football in the fourth quarter near the goal line, which might have been a pick-six. He finished with five total tackles, two tackles for a loss and one pass deflection.

Patriots linebackers: Kenyan Drake had his way with the Patriots defense. New England simply did not have an answer for the explosive running back. Not only did Drake manage 193 yards from scrimmage, but the Patriots linebackers also appeared to blow coverage on Jarvis Landry in the third quarter. He was wide-open.
Patriots offensive line: On occasion, Brady admits he's sore after some of the more physical games of the season. It's fair to say he'll be sore on Tuesday. Brady got pummeled by the Dolphins pass rush for six hits and two sacks. But they seemed to manage far more than that. Brady couldn't set his feet in the pocket and couldn't escape without getting slammed.
Malcolm Butler, CB: Dolphins receiver Jakeem Grant, who stands 5-foot-6, absolutely shamed Butler for a 25-yard touchdown reception. Butler did well tackling in the open field, but he continues to struggle when tracking the footballs thrown over his head.

Brandin Cooks/Chris Hogan/Phillip Dorsett: Two catches, 39 yards. Cooks' 38-yard catch came at a point when it was too little, too late. Hogan nearly hauled in a late touchdown, but couldn't keep his feet inbounds. In a game when the Patriots badly needed a receiver to step up in Rob Gronkowski's absence, none of these players mustered much production.

Tops Friendly Markets and PepsiCo have partnered with Feed the Children to provide 800 families in need in Rochester, New York, with a week's worth of food and essentials—enough supplies to fill two large semi-trucks.
“We know families are beginning to prepare for a new school year and we want to help them get off to a great start by providing for some of their needs,” said Bonnie Keith, New York account manager for PepsiCo's Frito-Lay division. “Families should never have to wonder where their next meal is coming from, and we're proud to continue our partnership with Feed the Children and Tops Friendly Markets to help the great people of Rochester.”
Each qualifying recipient, previously identified by Catholic Family Center, will be given one 25-lb. box of nonperishable food items; one 10-lb. box of personal care items; one box of Avon products; one 20-count Frito-Lay Smart Mix snacks; one 20-count Frito-Lay Baked & Popped Mix snacks; Quaker Chewy Granola Bars; Quaker Standard Oats; Quaker Breakfast Flats; Aquafina water; and Lipton Iced Tea. Produce and non-perishable food items are provided by Tops.
“Tops is committed to eradicating hunger in the communities we serve. We're thrilled to partner with our friends at PepsiCo and Feed the Children on this initiative. The way we see it, we're simply neighbors helping neighbors,” said Andrew Brocato, director of community relations at Tops Friendly Markets.
This is the third annual event PepsiCo, Tops and Feed the Children have hosted in the Rochester community, where 32 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. Similar events will be hosted in other major U.S. cities throughout the remainder of the year.
Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari will approve a new law to reduce age limits in political office, which could make it easier for younger candidates to run in next year's election.
The move comes after intense pressure from youth groups, which pushed the government to adopt the legislation, saying they were politically marginalised.
“In (a) few days to come, I will be joined by many promising young Nigerians to sign into law the ‘Not Too Young To Run' bill,” President Buhari, 75, said in a speech to mark the country's annual Democracy Day public holiday.
Last month President Buhari said that he would run for a second term next year.
The bill reduces the minimum age for presidential candidates from 40 to 35, and senators and state governors from 35 to 30.
The minimum age for national and state assembly members will now become 25.
He also reassured Nigerians during his speech of the administration's commitment to improving security and fighting Boko Haram.
“Public safety and security remains the primary duty of this government. Before this administration came into being three years ago, Boko Haram held large areas of land spanning several local governments in the northeast,” he said.
“Today, the capacity of the insurgents has been degraded.”
He also said “culprits and their sponsors shall be made to face the full wrath of the law” in reference to the clashes between farming communities and herders

The man suspected of killing at least 10 people on Monday by plowing a rented white van down crowded Toronto sidewalks appeared in court Tuesday morning and has been charged with 10 counts of murder and 13 counts of attempted murder.
And the Toronto police officer who arrested Alek Minassian, who during a tense standoff repeatedly yelled that he wanted the officer to shoot him, is receiving wide praise for his restraint. The CBC says the officer has been identified as Constable Ken Lam.
In video shot by bystanders, the suspect stands next to the battered white van and draws what looks to be a weapon (police later said he had no weapon on him, according to the Toronto Star).
The officer is pointing a gun at him. "Get down!" Lam is heard saying. "Kill me!" says the suspect, claiming that he has a gun in his pocket. "I don't care, get down!" the officer replies. "Get down or you'll be shot."
"Shoot me in the head," the suspect says. The officer continues to urge him to get down. Seconds later, the video shows the suspect on the ground as the officer puts him in handcuffs. Lam did not fire any shots.
Mike McCormack, president of the Toronto Police Association, said he believes the officer prevented further carnage, the Star reports.
"He's shaken up by the whole thing, and shaken up by the magnitude. He said, 'You know, I was just doing my job,' " McCormack said. "He's been confronted by someone who is making like he has a weapon, threatening the officer's life, trying to get the officer to shoot him, and he arrests that guy."
Ralph Goodale, Canada's minister of public safety and emergency preparedness, said on Twitter that he was "grateful for the brave and professional response of @TorontoPolice and other first responders to the horrific attack at Yonge and Finch," the streets where the attack took place.
Star columnist Rosie DiManno describes the officer as "remarkably composed."
"All the fingerprints of suicide by cop," she writes. "But the officer didn't shoot and the suspect dropped to his knees, flinging his arms in the air."
DiManno adds: "On a day of many heroes, that brave cop is at the top of the list, along with the many first responders, paramedics and hospital resources stretched to the limits."
The CBC reports that this incident "stands in contrast to footage of other police takedowns in Toronto that haven't ended peacefully." Here's more:
"The Toronto Police Service was widely criticized for its handling of the Sammy Yatim case in 2013 that led to Const. James Forcillo's conviction for attempted murder in the shooting death of the 18-year-old. Forcillo is appealing his sentence of six years in prison. ... "Members of the Toronto Police Services Board passed a motion in February to issue hundreds of more conducted energy weapons (CEWs), or Tasers, to certain on-duty constables. The move is billed as a way to help the police force achieve a goal of zero deaths when it comes to interactions between the public and police. "Part of the approved motion also requires the TPS to conduct a review of other use-of-force options and gather input from the public and affected groups."
The motive in Monday's van attack is unclear, although police told reporters yesterday that they believe the rampage was deliberate. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday that there is no evidence the incident "has a national security element," according to the CBC.

SYRACUSE, NEW YORK—According to a report in The Guardian, a team of researchers led by Reg Murphy of Syracuse University is looking for evidence of the foods eaten by the Caribs who lived on a 12-acre site in Indian Creek on the island of Antigua from about A.D. 1300 until they were displaced by Europeans. Colonial-era historians claimed that the Caribs were cannibals who wiped out the Arawak people who had inhabited Antigua before them. The excavation has uncovered tiny bones, pollen, and stone tools bearing residues of fish and corn. “From analyzing their diet we have found no evidence that Caribs ever ate humans,” Murphy said. The researchers are now investigating why the Caribs and Arawaks chose to live in an inland area, away from marine resources, for some 2,000 years. “We don't know what was so special about here, or how they could have survived in this scrubby area,” Murphy said.

The Christmas break, bye week and all-star break are in the Dallas Stars' rearview mirror. From their precarious perch in the Western Conference's first wild card spot, the playoffs are within reach. Could general manager Jim Nill swing a deal to improve the Stars' playoff chances between now and the February 26 trade deadline?
Some have suggested the team might benefit from the addition of a left-shooting veteran defenseman. The emergence of Dan Hamhuis and Greg Pateryn as a reliable shutdown pair, coupled with the solid play of the Esa Lindell and John Klingberg tandem, make any such blue line acquisition a luxury, rather than a necessity.
What the Stars really could use is a veteran top-six winger. With several teams already in “sell” mode and others expected to test the waters over the next few weeks, Nill has several options.
Evander Kane: Stars' Expensive Gamble?
Perhaps the biggest name among so-called “rental” forwards is Evander Kane. The pending unrestricted free agent winger has 16 goals and 20 assists through 51 games and is the struggling Buffalo Sabres' top trade chip. While the Stars could benefit from Kane's scoring ability, three factors make him a long shot to move to Dallas: competition, price and playoff performance.
If Nill chooses to pursue Kane, he'll have to compete with several other general managers. Competition will drive up the Sabres' asking price, which is already expected to be quite steep.
A high-priced rental of Kane's stature could be a risk worth taking, except for one thing: He's never played an NHL playoff game. Not one. Not ever.
It's not Kane's fault he's spent his entire NHL career to this point on subpar teams, but the Stars can't afford to overpay for a rental player with no playoff pedigree. If Kane does come to Dallas, it'll likely be as a free agent on July 1, not as a trade deadline acquisition.
An Intriguing Trio of Tex's Rangers
The New York Rangers are very much in the playoff hunt but, as NHL.com's Dan Rosen reports, they're expected to test the market on several players. Three Rangers wingers could be of interest to the Stars: Rick Nash, Michael Grabner and Mats Zuccarello.
Of the trio, Nash is perhaps the most intriguing. Though his name isn't on the Stanley Cup, the veteran power forward has played in 73 playoff games over the last five seasons, tallying 14g-24a-38pts in that span.
Nash's postseason stats aren't what you might expect from a top-line winger, but he could benefit from a reduced role in Dallas, skiing in the wake of the Benn-Seguin-Radulov speedboat. Also worth noting is the history Nash and Stars coach Ken Hitchcock share. They spent the better part of four seasons together with the Columbus Blue Jackets and Nash became captain in the latter half of Hitchcock's tenure.
Like Nash, Grabner is another pending UFA who could help the Stars. Though slotted into a bottom-six role, the speedy Austrian makes the most of his minutes, notching 27 goals in 2016-17 and 21 through 50 games this season. Grabner's budget-friendly $1.65 million caps hit more than makes up for his relative (to Nash) lack of playoff experience, and a Stars fourth line of Remi Elie – Devin Shore – Grabner could be exactly the sort of “secret weapon” with which playoff battles are won.
Last, and least likely to be traded, is Mats Zuccarello. The diminutive (5 foot 8, 179 pounds) Norwegian has excellent vision, as indicated by his assist totals over the last five seasons. While the Rangers' top-line right wing can score goals himself, his ideal role is that of a set-up man, passing the puck and collecting an assist. With 45 power play points over the last three seasons, “Zucc” would give the Stars another very dangerous option on the man-advantage.
Zuccarello, who has one year remaining on his contract at an easy-to-swallow $4.5 million cap hit, would carry the highest price tag of the Blueshirts' trio in any trade. Whether or not the Stars are willing to pay that price is debatable, but there's no doubt that the skilled winger would make them a much more dangerous team.
Another Stars-Canadiens Trade?
Trade rumors have swirled around Montreal Canadiens captain Max Pacioretty since last season. With the Habs 10 points out of a playoff spot and falling, a move seems imminent.
Pacioretty, who has scored 30-plus goals in each of his last five full seasons, is on pace for just 26 this year. Despite the decline, the Canadiens' captain leads his struggling team in scoring. Like Zuccarello, Pacioretty has one year left on his current contract at a cap hit of $4.5 million.
The combination of Pacioretty's goal-scoring ability, proven leadership skills and cap-friendly contract make him a very attractive option for the Stars. Nill and Marc Bergevin pulled off a mutually-beneficial swap last season; perhaps they'll do it again.
Didier Hilhorst is a director of design at Uber. In this episode, he shares how his graduate degree in economics helped mold him as a designer and, in turn, shape how he and his team redesigned Uber from the ground up.
It's not every day economics and design overlap with one another. But for Didier, they do. He explains how elements usually not thought of as a design tool, such as price, can be used as part of the product experience, not just an afterthought.
Starting a redesign from scratch with a product as large as Uber is no easy task. To help facilitate better communication between designers and engineers, Didier explains how Uber built an internal tool from scratch to help design at scale.

Should You Leave Grandma With The Robot?

Every day, we are inching closer to some kind of artificial intelligence.
At this point, it isn't so important whether we're talking about truly self-conscious machines or not. Advances in big data, machine learning and robotics are all poised to give us a world in which computers are effectively intelligent in terms of how we deal with them.
Should you be scared by this proposition? Based on a lecture I just attended, my answer is: "absolutely, but not in the usual 'robot overlords' kind of way."
Instead, the real fear should be about getting human beings wrong, not getting AI right.
The lecture I attended was given by Rana el Kaliouby. She is a brilliant scientist who works on giving computers the ability recognize the emotions of humans they interact with. More than just an academic, she is also an entrepreneur. El Kaliouby is CEO of Affectiva, a company whose "AI humanizes how people and technology interact."
But while El Kaliouby's presentation was thrilling (she is a truly engaging speaker), the longer the lecture went on, the more troubled I became.
The essence of the technology that Affectiva pioneers is the ability of computers to recognize human emotions based on the "activation" of muscles in the face. The link between facial expressions and emotions is, of course, something we humans all know how to read. But researchers have gone beyond the gross characteristics of "smile" vs. "frown" to map out groups of facial muscles and their links to specific emotional states. The AI built by Affectiva can identify the positions of facial muscles and uses them to infer the emotional state of its user. Then the machine responds in ways that take that emotional state into account. (The company is also working on identifying emotions using speech.)
One potential application for the technology's use would be to provide "emotional robots" for the elderly. Having a machine that could converse in an empathic way would give an older person without much human contact "someone" to spend time with.
The fact that this is even possible is pretty remarkable and serves as a testimony to how far and how fast our machines have come in the ability to react to environments (including us). But as more potential applications of the technology were discussed in El Kaliouby's lecture, the more it became clear to me how the technology is also a kind of trap we are preparing for ourselves.
We often like to say that technology is "value free." Scientists make their discoveries and engineers build their inventions, and these are all free of "values." It's society that adds those in. But I have never bought fully into that equation. All research occurs in cultural settings. Why are some research questions considered important (and worthy of funding) while others are deemed uninteresting? The answer to this question is always colored by the culture in which the researchers live.
More importantly, research programs can come with a raft of philosophical baggage. These underpin the assumptions made in developing and carrying forward those programs. The assumption that lies behind emotional computing technologies is that facial states capture emotions. From the computers point of view, they are emotions. At the root of this equation is a reduction of human experience to neural programming whose outward manifestation can be captured algorithmically.
The point here is not to begin an argument about the nature of consciousness. Instead, it's to see how technologies like Affectiva have built-in assumptions about what we are as humans. As the technologies are deployed in the world, they can reframe the world. In this way, technologies can rewire society in ways that can be hard to escape from. If you want an example, just think iPhones and social media.
So imagine we get robots that keep lonely, older people company. That is a good thing right? But won't that also relieve us from questioning how we ended up in a society that warehouses the elderly because we don't know what else to do with them? Might there be other, more humane — and human — solutions than robots (that will be sold at a steep price by the robot companies)?
Another example given in the lecture was something along the lines of allowing a family to watch different versions of the same show but each version gets tuned, in real time, to that family member's emotions. Perhaps the computer senses that brother wants a happy ending but sis wants everyone to die. I found this idea more than a little horrifying. It's not as if we don't live in our own bubbles enough now. Why provide more means to pull us away from shared experience?
This led to another troublesome problem. The technology will clearly have useful applications, like developing learning apps for kids with autism. But it will be in the domains of sales and coercion that it finds its greatest deployment. Our "emotion data" will be used against us to make money, or worse, for someone else.
But, at the root of it all, is the fact that "emotion data" is not the same thing as the real, vivid, present, enacted emotional experiences we have being human. Our emotions are not our faces or our voices. They aren't data. They can't be pulled out like a thread, one by one, from the fabric of our being.
But once a technology that treats emotions as data becomes pervasive, we may soon find that data is the only aspect of emotion we come to recognize or value. Once billions of dollars flood into that equation, we may find ourselves trapped in a pervasive technology that flattens our experiences and reduces our lives.
And that, more than robot overlords, is what scares me about AI.

The High Court in the lakeshore district of Salima has convicted Limbani Maliro after pleading guilty to murdering popular evangelist Shadreck Wame.
Maliro, a houseboy to the evangelist was arrested by the police in Thyolo on November 25, 2016 after being hunted for a month.
Legal Aid Bureau Director Masauko Chankakala confirmed of the development in an interview with the press, saying Maliro pleaded guilty own his on.
According to Chinkakala, Maliro will be sentenced on Wednesday.
Murder carries a maximum of death sentence in Malawi but there is a moratorium on the punishment.
Days Of Our Lives fans are wondering what is going to happen with Joey Johnson (James Lastovic) and Jade Michaels (Paige Searcy). The two are expecting a baby, but fate might have another idea. Will they suffer a miscarriage? Also, when will Gabrielle Haugh assume the role of Jade when Paige Searcy leaves? DOOL spoilers are ahead. Do not continue reading unless you want to know details on what to expect next on the long-running soap opera. Her eyes are lovely dark and deep, and she has promises to keep, and miles, and miles to go before she sleeps. A photo posted by P A I G E S E A R C Y (@paigesearcy) on Dec 9, 2016 at 2:50pm PST Joey and Jade‘s pregnancy on Days Of Our Lives was unexpected. He was about to break up with his girlfriend after she became obsessive and wouldn't stop texting him several times each hour. Right when he was about to break the news to her, Jade announced she was expecting a baby. However, Joey had a hard time believing it because of the timing and the fact that Jade has lied and manipulated in the past. A pregnancy test that Kayla (Mary Beth Evans) ordered came back positive. Even though nobody really seems to like Jade on Days Of Our Lives, she did seem excited about becoming a mother. Her outrageous behavior is also a bit more understandable considering the actions and words coming from her father. Just recently, Steve (Stephen Nichols) and Kayla were starting to warm up to Jade. Just when she was starting to feel like part of the family, she is going to lose the baby she is carrying. According to the latest issue of Soap Opera Digest, on Tuesday's episode of the NBC soap opera, Joey and Jade will deal with a tragic loss. A sneak peek photo published by the magazine shows Jade in the hospital, clutching her stomach, and screaming out in agony. Joey is by her side and looks like he is trying to comfort her. It is clear that Jade has a miscarriage. Days Of Our Lives spoilers hint that Joey and Jade will try to cope with the loss the best they can. Will it drive them closer together or further apart? How will Steve and Kayla help Jade through the tragedy, if they do anything at all? Hike today. Donut tomorrow. A photo posted by James Lastovic (@jameslastovic) on Jan 1, 2017 at 1:34pm PST As fans know, Paige Searcy is leaving Days Of Our Lives. Gabrielle Haugh was selected to take her place. Some viewers thought Jade would leave Salem for a bit and then return with a different look. However, there is a good chance that it will happen instantly, with Paige as Jade one day, then Gabrielle playing the role the next. Other Days Of Our Lives spoilers include Hope Brady (Kristian Alfonso) getting attacked in prison. Her stabbing worries Rafe Hernandez (Galen Gering), but he decides the best way to help her is by going to Prague. He, along with some other Salem residents, including Marlena Evans (Deidre Hall), will be searching for Stefano DiMera. Joseph Mascolo filmed some DOOL scenes prior to his death. Also, Nancy (Patrika Darbo) will keep baby Holly from Nicole (Arianne Zucker). In an attempt to keep Chloe's (Nadia Bjorlin) secret, Nancy will tamper with the DNA results. This throws Brady Black (Eric Martsolf) off the trail. As for Deimos Kiriakis (Vincent Irizarry), he will ask Nicole to marry him. However, their happiness does not last long because Nicole will be investigated for attempted murder. Who she allegedly tries to kill was not revealed, but it's hard to imagine Nicole getting that violent with anyone. What do you think is going to happen on Days Of Our Lives? Do you think Joey and Jade should stay together or is there a better girl out there for Steve and Kayla's son? Will the miscarriage bring them closer or drive them apart?

L'Arche Halifax will hold their art show and sale beginning April 21st at the St. Agnes Church Hall.
If you've ever wanted to fulfill your childhood dream of holding a lightsaber in your hand, virtual rality can be the vehicle to set those fantasies back in motion.
At the official unveiling of the flagship IMAX VR center on Los Angeles' Fairfax Avenue on Tuesday afternoon, viewers were taken into a large room housing 14 different pods, each containing a different VR experience that allows its users to temporarily escape real life.
In one of those pods, users can experience “Star Wars: Trials of Tatooine,” as they delve into the desert planet of Tatooine geared up as Luke Skywalker. Equipped with an HTC Vive headset, head-mounted display, a control device and sensory vest, users can feel the rumble of the deflected laser beams and the weight of the Skywalker's electrifying green lightsaber.
At the event, IMAX VR announced it has signed agreements to open four more IMAX VR centers in the coming months across the U.S. and China, with hubs in Shanghai, one at an AMC New York location, and two at Regal locations in New York and California.
The company also announced it has joined Steven Spielberg, Twentieth Century Fox, Warner Bros. and other corporations as first-round investors in Dreamscape Immersive, a new Los-Angeles based startup for location based VR.
IMAX is also in partnership with ABC and Disney for a television show called “The Inhumans,” premiering in September.
IMAX CEO Richard Gelfond told Variety that now is the right time to go into VR because of the amount of capital and talent that is being poured into the brand, referring to today's announcement of investors.
“One of my wishes is that a couple of years from now, people think of us not just for the experiences we provide now, but as a much broader entertainment company,” Gelfond said.
A man has been sentenced to 16 to 20 years in prison for second-degree murder in the fatal hit-and-run of a Detroit police officer.
Fifty-five-year-old Steve Guzina of Lincoln Park also received 10-15-year sentences on each of two other charges: operating under the influence causing death and not stopping at the scene of an accident. The sentences will run concurrently.
Guzina pleaded guilty last month to hitting 40-year-old Officer Myron Jarrett and causing the officer's death Oct. 28 on the city's west side while Jarrett was assisting other officers with a traffic accident investigation.
Prosecutors have said Guzina was under the influence of crack cocaine while driving at a high speed past the accident scene.
Guzina will receive 290 days credit for time spent in jail while awaiting trial.

FLATS used by the Mid and West Wales Fire Service (MAWWFRS) as a training facility are going to be renovated into supported living homes.
A Powys County Council (PCC) and MAWWFRS collaboration provides training facilities for firefighters and flats due for renovation in Llandrindod Wells have provided local fire crews with the opportunity to test their skills.
‘Fairview', a large Victorian building near the centre of Llandrindod, will undergo major refurbishment early next year to provide new supported housing. Thirteen new flats will be available to support people with additional needs.
The property, which is owned by PCC, is currently empty and awaiting building work to commence. This has allowed the PCC Housing Team and MAWWFRS to provide a series of training exercises for local firefighters at the property.
Cllr Rosemarie Harris, Cabinet Member for Housing said: “A budget of £1.1million has been allocated to renovate the property which will be refurbished into 13 flats over four floors, this will include a flat for staff accommodation, who will provide support to tenants.
“Fairview has been vacant since November 2015, as the property required significant work to bring it up to the Welsh Housing Quality Standards (WHQS).
“It is all the better that whilst waiting for works to commence, our colleagues in the Fire Service were able to use the property for their training.
“Neighbours had initial concerns that the firefighting training would be disruptive, but once our housing officer explained the planned exercises, local residents were very supportive.”
Watch Manager Phil Morris of MAWWFRS said: “It has been extremely beneficial to our crews, giving them a chance to practise their procedures in a new and realistic environment. Five of our local crews had the opportunity to test their breathing apparatus skills and test out procedures. The fact that it is a large Victorian building, converted in to flats, makes it all the more worthwhile as it will equip us to deal with all call-outs to buildings of this type.
“I'd also like to thank the neighbours for tolerating any disturbance we may have caused whilst carrying out the training, it was greatly appreciated.”
All flats will be refurbished to the current WHQS, this includes kitchens and bathrooms that meet the Royal National Institute of Blind and Dementia friendly recommendations. PCC's occupational therapists have also been involved with advising on the design of the flats.
Level access will be provided to all entrances and a lift will also be installed to provide access to all floors.
The rear garden is planned to be fully landscaped into a communal garden, providing a much-needed outside space for residents, including the provision of drying lines and small vegetable allotments.
The building works are scheduled to start in the January 2017 and anticipated to be completed in autumn 2017.
A 28-year-old man suspected of shooting two teenagers at a Pasadena birthday party was fatally shot by authorities Friday after being sought by a task force that included the U.S. Marshals Service.
The man was located along with a 36-year-old woman inside a vehicle about 1 p.m. in the 700 block of Encanto Parkway in Duarte, according to Deputy Joana Warren of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
After making contact with the occupants of the car, officers from three law enforcement agencies opened fire, Warren said. The man, who was on parole, was struck at least once and was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
The woman was also shot but was expected to survive. She was arrested on suspicion of possessing narcotics.
One officer was treated for minor injuries.
The man is suspected in a Pasadena shooting that took place Thursday about 8:30 p.m. in the 1700 block of North Summit Avenue, Pasadena Police Lt. John Mercado said.
A 19-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl were both struck. The male victim remains hospitalized in critical condition; the girl was treated and discharged that night.
In addition to the U.S. Marshals Task Force, the police departments of Pasadena and Glendale and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation had been tracking the suspect, Warren said.
The suspect's vehicle is being searched and evidence will be processed by the crime lab, Warren said.
Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call the sheriff's homicide bureau at (323) 890-5500.

Demolition has already been completed, but construction is about to begin on Auburn's new public safety complex.
Wednesday Auburn city officials and public safety officers officially broke ground on the new public safety complex. The complex will be around 70,000 square feet and will house a new fire station, public safety administration, the police division, Auburn municipal court and city council chambers.
“Public Safety has gone for so many years with inadequate facilities as the community has continued to grow. All of you associated with Public Safety, I'm not telling you anything you don't already know. We've got folks in closets and old jail sales in the police division, and judge it's a little cramped over on your side. So a great great day as we move forward with a fantastic facility” says Auburn Mayor, Bill Ham Jr.
This project is the largest single expenditure in Auburn's history and is expected to cost about $33 million and officials say that they hope to have people moved into the new building in 18 months.

There is a perfect storm brewing on the African continent between smoking, HIV and tuberculosis and diabetes. Public health leaders showed promising signs of tackling these at the recent international tobacco control conference in Cape Town, but UN meetings later this year will test leaders' real commitment, argue JOSÉ LUIS CASTRO and KATIE DAIN.
The big business of manufacturing cigarettes is under threat. Years of huge gains in tobacco control driven by the world's only global health treaty, the World Health Organisation's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control has seen growing enforcement of bans on advertising, smoke-free spaces, the phasing in of graphic packet warnings and plain packaging legislation and point of sale restrictions.
All these measures are starting to hurt the big business of tobacco sales. It has led tobacco giants like Philip Morris International to litigate against governments such as Australia and Uruguay, not necessarily with the intention of winning a court battle over trade policy, but rather to deliberately slow down the legislative process. This guarantees continuing sales under the status quo while the court process is under way.
We are also seeing a new pushback by the tobacco industry to interfere in the progress made against smoking-related death and illness. The announcement six months ago by Philip Morris International of its new $1-billion Foundation for a Smoke Free World could be the tip of the iceberg of a twin strategy aimed at getting new generations of non-smokers addicted in the developed world to novel nicotine products such as e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products and, in parallel, maintain traditional cigarette markets in the developing world.
These efforts to push back by Big Tobacco were met with an emphatic response from some of the leading lights in tobacco control attending the 17th World Conference on Tobacco or Health recently held in Cape Town.
Michael R Blomberg, the WHO Global Ambassador for Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies, announced the launch of a new global watchdog – STOP (Stopping Tobacco Organisations and Products) – to monitor tobacco industry interference.
World Health Organisation Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus re-affirmed that the WHO would not sit on its hands in the face of industry interference nor shy away from fights where sound science and public health were threatened by the tobacco industry.
Tobacco control is indeed at a crossroads and the battle lines are being drawn.
But we are also at a crossroads in the fight against other NCDs such as cardiovascular diseases (like heart attacks and stroke), cancer, chronic respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructed pulmonary disease and asthma), mental and neurological disorders, and diabetes.
Nowhere are the battle lines between public health authorities and Big Tobacco, Big Food and Big Soda sharper than in South Africa and on the African continent:
Nearly a quarter of African men smoke.
Some 32% of children aged 2-4 in South Africa are overweight. The estimated prevalence of obesity South Africa is around 27% and predicted to rise to the same level as children by 2025.
Some 1.83 million adults in South Africa are living with diabetes, and more than 15.9 million people across Africa. If we do not act now, this figure will increase by 156% by 2045.
Africa has the highest percentage of undiagnosed people – 69% of people with diabetes do not know they have it. In 2015 there were some 17,400 premature deaths from diabetes among people under the age 70 in South Africa. Diabetes will cause 312,000 deaths in Africa in 2017. The total healthcare expenditure for diabetes across the continent is around $3.3-billion.
A good chunk of Africa is sick but it is a chunk on junk that food and drink manufactures are keen to maintain. While the tobacco industry adheres to more restrictive rules in the developed world, it exploits loopholes and exerts pressure on governments in the developing world. So too do the food and beverage manufacturers to ensure that cheaper, unhealthier options on supermarket shelves are the norm rather than the exception.
There is a perfect storm brewing on the continent between smoking, infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis and diabetes, a non-communicable disease.
Prevalent rates of smoking among HIV positive people are considerably higher than the rest of the community. People with diabetes are at a vastly higher risk of contracting TB, while in turn TB worsens blood glucose control for people living with diabetes.
We are at a crossroads and some tough decisions confront public health authorities.
In 2018 there is a golden opportunity to do just that. In September, the United Nations will hold a High-Level meeting on Non-Communicable Diseases as well as the first ever High-Level Meeting on Tuberculosis, now the biggest infectious diseases killer in the world, one that for most people is curable but kills some 1.8 million poor people each year.
World leaders have the opportunity to turn the tide on an infectious disease that needlessly kills the most vulnerable and at the same time avoid 15 million premature deaths from non-communicable diseases, 80% of which occur in low- and middle-income countries.
The encouraging signs we saw in Cape Town well might have been the moment and place to kick-start some much-needed political will and commitment on the road to New York in September. DM

Chairman of the Police Welfare Association (PWA) Corporal Jefferson Drigo has disclosed that his executive is on a drive to bring back the “camaraderie” which once existed in the police force in Dominica.
In that vein, Drigo disclosed that to improve the esprit de corps (a feeling of pride and mutual loyalty shared by the members of a group) within the rank and file of the force will be staging a series of Trump card games, dubbed a “Trumporama,” at the Police Headquarters in Roseau on July 7, 2018.
“We have about 17 teams: police, customs, retired police officers and fire department,” Drigo explained. “It will be staged in a knockout format at Police Headquarters (250 points for the knockout stage) of the Trumporama. We will also have the police unity band from 9:30pm who will thrill those present with some good music.”
Drigo said the police force is presently facing a lot of challenges.
“The police force has a lot of challenges and it's a stressful job,” he stated. “Police officers are denied vacation leave and their accumulated rest days which are also being denied.”
He said the PWA has visited various police stations and the officers are very happy about the event which will commence from 2:30 pm after a brief opening ceremony.
Drigo also said the police force is at a turning point.
“We love the public and are here to protect life and property. We are not perfect and things will happen. The police force is at a turning point where we need leadership and togetherness. Work hard and smart and diligently and take care of the vehicles entrusted to your care and together we will build back the moral of the Commonwealth of Dominica Police Force,” he said.
Drigo also disclosed that the PWA will hold a special meeting on Friday July 6, 2018 at 2:30 pm at the DPSU building for all police officers.
“We will have all the burning issues discussed and we will also have our attorney John Elue Charles who will address officers on various matters,” he said.

Lewis Hamilton stormed to pole position for the Japanese Grand Prix as title rival Sebastian Vettel could not get close to the Mercedes.
After out-scoring Vettel with an under-performing car in the last two races, Mercedes were back to their dominant best at Suzuka.
Hamilton's record 71st pole position was never in doubt and he will be joined on the front-row by the Ferrari of Vettel - who was third fastest but moves up after the second Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas was hit with a grid penalty.
This was Hamilton's maiden pole position at Suzuka, his other two Japanese Grand Prix poles coming at Fuji.
But he has won here twice in the past and if he can make it a hat-trick of victories on Sunday a fourth world championship will start to become close to reality.

Hamilton clocked a time of one minute 27.319 seconds to breeze to pole, with Bottas getting closest.
The Finn will start sixth after a five-place penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change so at least Vettel will be alongside Hamilton at the start as he looks to close the 34-point gap in the championship standings.
The Red Bull pair of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen will occupy the second row, while Esteban Ocon benefitted from Kimi Raikkonen's own gearbox change penalty and will start fifth.
Bottas is now sixth ahead of the second Force India of Sergio Perez, while Felipe Massa's Williams, the McLaren and Stoffel Vandoorne and Renault's Nico Hulkenberg also start inside the top 10.

That is because Raikkonen could only manage the sixth-fastest time and so will drop to 11th, while Fernando Alonso reached Q3 but will start from the back after his own 35-place penalty.
The first qualifying session was cut short by a red flag after Romain Grosjean crashed his Haas at turn five.
Hamilton was delighted to finally break his Suzuka duck and admitted everything came together at the right time.
"It has been a really good day and every lap was fantastic," he said.
"I never really got a great balance in the past I never did a great qualifying. The car is crazy here. I've been running out of opportunities to get this pole so I knew I had to make it stick today."

KARACHI - Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) Chairman Zafar Hijazi has emphasized upon the need for implementing reforms for investor protection in a forceful and timely manner, and in particular advised the Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited (PSX) Board chairman to ensure that there is no compromise on this aspect.
Hijazi said this at a meeting held on Tuesday between the board of directors of the Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited (PSX) and full bench of the SECP wherein the matter of recent broker default at PSX was discussed in detail.
The PSX board shared findings and recommendations of an internal inquiry into the recent broker default and role of the Chief Regulatory Officer (CRO) of the Exchange in timely detection and reporting of the same.
During the meeting, a number of measures were discussed which were directed for implementation by the commission in its previous meeting with the PSX board held on February 8, 2016. In order to strengthen the Exchange's capacity as a frontline regulator, PSX agreed to put in place a stronger inspection regime for brokers, and on the need to establish a national level brokers' association as a self-regulatory organization under the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan Act, 1997.
The SECP chairman advised the Exchange to expedite sale of assets of defaulting brokers and put in all efforts for early resolution of pending litigation in order to ensure that all pending claims of investors are satisfied in an expeditious manner, in particular small investors. The SECP also advised PSX to provide fortnightly update on all pending cases to the commission. PSX was further directed to expedite implementation of the regulations relating to standardisation of brokers' back office software as advised by SECP previously, which could have played a critical role in avoiding the recent broker defaults.
The SECP stressed upon PSX to introduce stringent requirements for opening and operating branch offices by brokers and for strict monitoring of such branch offices for regulatory compliance, to ensure investor protection and discourage brokers from circumventing regulatory requirements. The SECP chairman expressed his concern over some single member companies acting as stockbrokers and directed the Exchange to ensure all such brokers convert to a private or public company within specified time period.

Every week on Foodie Friday cookbook author and Gourmet Warehouse founder Caren McSherry joins CKNW's Simi Sara with another recipe to wow your guests and up your game in the kitchen.
LISTEN: A global classic with a twist
This dip is a global classic, with versions that abound. The standard ingredients include garlic, tahini, lemon juice, cumin and olive oil. Twists on classics are always a good thing, so I chose to add Moroccan spice, and top with crispy whole chickpeas, a crumble of feta, torn cilantro and pomegranate seeds.
What you need
1 can (19 oz) chickpeas, drained, liquid reserved
4 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
3 Tbsp tahini paste
2 cloves garlic
2 tsp Moroccan seasoning spice blend
1/4 tsp ground cumin
Pinch sea salt
Freshly ground pepper
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to finish
1 cup crumbled Feta cheese (optional)
1/2 cup torn fresh cilantro leaves (optional)
1/2 cup pomegranate seeds (optional)
Crispy Chickpeas
1 cup of drained and rinsed canned chickpeas
1/2 cup rice flour
1 cup roasted grapeseed oil for frying
How to make it
To make the hummus, place the drained chickpeas in the bowl of a food processor. Add the lemon juice, tahini, and garlic, and purée until smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in the Moroccan spice, cumin, sea salt, and pepper to taste, and pulse until combined.
With the machine running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil, taste for seasoning and adjust if needed. If the hummus seems too thick for your preference, add a few tablespoons of the reserved chickpeas liquid and pulse. Transfer the hummus to a rectangular serving dish.
To make the crispy chickpeas, lay 1 cup of chickpeas on a paper towel for about 20 minutes to remove most of the moisture. Place the rice flour in a bowl, add the dry chickpeas and toss to ensure they are evenly coated. Place the chickpeas in a mesh sieve and give them a shake or two to remove any excess flour. Heat the oil in a pan over medium-high heat until it sizzles when you drop in a chickpea. In small batches, about a handful at a time to avoid overcrowding, fry the chickpeas until crisp, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon onto a plate lined with paper towel and let it cool.
Sprinkle the chickpeas over the hummus, along with the feta, cilantro, and pomegranate seeds, if using, and a drizzle of olive oil.
Serve with seeded baguette or pita chips. The hummus can be made up to 5 days ahead and kept in the refrigerator, while the crispy chickpeas can be kept in an airtight container for up to 2 days — if they last that long!
Makes 3 cups of hummus and 1 cup of crispy chickpeas
It's been over a week since we've heard from Meghan Markle and Prince Harry? They're on holiday in Botswana for most of August. And the trip was planned so that they'd be alone most of the time, away from the public and the press. Of course the speculation is that he'll propose. Or has already proposed? Even though they've yet to be seen since arriving at the airport in Botswana, there are now reports that they're engaged. And that the symbol of their engagement was kinda like the symbol of their dancing – on the wrist and not the finger. (Dlisted)
Did you read Taffy Brodesser-Akner's recent piece in the NYT about dieting in the “anti-dieting age”? If not, you should. I mean, it's Taffy. But instead of writing hilariously about celebrities, Taffy's writing hilarious and poignantly about herself and her relationship with her body. Basically we've stopped saying the word “diet”. But it doesn't mean that body image ideals have changed, it just means that we're talking around it. Is the beauty industry doing the same thing by eliminating the term “anti-aging”? (Jezebel)

Maybe you don't want to admit it because of the Justin Bieber association. But it's also Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee. You could say it's mostly Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee since they actually know the words. Despacito keeps breaking records. Despacito now has something in common with Whitney Houston. Seriously.

In creating their seasonal lineups, television networks have increasingly looked to Hollywood for inspiration. In recent years, we've seen FOX adapt Lethal Weapon, CBS revive Training Day, NBC reimagine Bad Boys, and Disney reunite The Mighty Ducks. Now comes word of CBS's plans to reboot L.A. Confidential.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, CBS has ordered a new adaptation of James Ellroy's novel and subsequent 1997 feature film, which starred Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce, Kim Basinger, and Russell Crowe. Written by Jordan Harper (Gotham, The Mentalist), the reimagined TV series “follows the intersecting paths of three homicide detectives, a female reporter and an up-and-coming actress while the detectives pursue a sadistic serial killer among the secrets and lies of gritty, glamorous 1950s Los Angeles. The drama is described as having a modern tone, music and style while still being set in the '50s,” notes THR.
Arnon Milchan, who produced the film, will return to executive produce the TV reboot.
MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — A Somali police officer says a suicide bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at a security checkpoint near Mogadishu's international airport, killing at least three people.
Capt. Mohamed Hussein says the bomb detonated Monday as security forces were searching cars at the checkpoint, a few hundred meters (yards) from the main base of the African Union peacekeeping mission.
The checkpoint is close to United Nations offices and the Peace Hotel, which is often frequented by foreigners and officials. The powerful blast blew roofs off nearby buildings.
A second blast and heavy gunfire could be heard at the checkpoint after the attack, but there were no immediate details.
The al-Qaida-linked Islamic extremist group al-Shabab, which often carries out such attacks, quickly claimed responsibility for Monday's attack through its radio arm, Andalus.
Despite being ousted from most of its key strongholds across large parts of south and central Somalia, the homegrown group continues to wage deadly attacks across the country.
Somalia's capital has seen frequent bomb attacks at hotels and military checkpoints. In July, two al-Shabab suicide bombers detonated explosives-laden cars outside the office of the U.N.'s mine-clearing agency and an army checkpoint near the African Union's main base, killing 13.
The assaults have threatened this Horn of Africa nation's attempts to rebuild from decades of chaos. The country's presidential election, a key step toward recovery, already has been delayed multiple times because of security and other concerns.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the United States would likely reach a trade agreement with China and that officials from both sides would sit down for negotiations in a few days.

China has said it would welcome a visit by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is seeking to resolve a tense trade dispute between the world's two largest economies after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese imports.
“China's very serious, and we're very serious,” Trump told reporters, adding that Mnuchin would travel to China as part of a delegation requested by Beijing. “We've got a very good chance at making a deal.”
Trump, speaking at the White House following a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, also said the United States was engaged in serious trade talks with the European Union, adding that U.S.-France trade relations were very good
“I would rather deal just with France,” he said.
Trump also said negotiations with Mexico and Canada over the North American Free Trade Agreement(NAFTA) were proceeding “very nicely.”
The Americans, FX
fThe bond between Philip (Matthew Rhys) and Elizabeth Jennings (Keri Russell) isn't the only strong marriage in FX's The Americans. The show's sacred matrimony of sound and screen has also been quite enviable, and that's due to the exceptional work of P.J. Bloom. For six straight seasons, the veteran music supervisor of past hits like The Shield and Nip/Tuck has layered Joe Weisberg and Joel Fields' outstanding and underrated cold war drama with some of the greatest pop music of all time.
“The thing about The Americans and what Joe and Joel have managed to create is that it's this incredible time capsule,” Bloom told The A.V. Club in 2016. “All aspects of the show are so completely rooted in our early 1980s time period. It's in the music and the sets. It's in the wardrobe and the props. You could really be watching a television show in 1982 or 1983, or be walking down the street during that time, and be seeing and experiencing the same thing our audience is experiencing.”
Much like Michael Mann's iconic '80s cop drama Miami Vice, which this show subtly pays homage to with the inclusion of Phil Collins' “In the Air Tonight” at the end of its stellar pilot, music adds an essential depth to the scenes and embellishes so many of the characters' motives, conflicts, and feelings. Over the years, this has led to some incredibly vivid and elaborate sequences, many of which are memorable solely for its musical inclusions, from the likes of Fleetwood Mac to Peter Gabriel to Yazoo.
Now that the final season has come and gone, leaving us in tears as we speculate on the future of the now-splintered Jennings family, we've decided to reminisce on the show's greatest musical moments. Because there were so many to choose from, and since there are only 10 slots available, we opted to only include one song per artist, which may disappoint some of you. Also know that not every scene is on YouTube, so you'll have to use your imagination for a couple entries — or seek out the episodes yourself.
Oh, it also goes without saying: There will be spoilers.

Every once in a while you run across a dish that stays with you. Just ask reader Susan Slesinger of Seal Beach; she's been thinking about the lemon cornmeal muffins from John Besh's Willa Jean Restaurant in New Orleans ever since she was in the Crescent City last July. These little cakes make the perfect breakfast or dessert — or a fun snack any time of the day, really. Luckily, we were able to get the recipe.
And did you know that more than one-third of the food we buy will end up in the trash? Food waste is a serious issue, but there are creative — and delicious — ways to combat the problem. We've come up with a dozen of our favorite recipes using kitchen scraps. You'll never look at asparagus ends in the same way.

SPRINGFIELD - A second man is facing charges following an armed confrontation and shooting outside a Springfield home.
Akeem Anderson, 21, of Springfield, pleaded not guilty Friday in Springfield District Court to charges related to an encounter on Edgewood Street that ended with a homeowner shooting a visitor on his porch.
At the request of Assistant District Attorney Cary Szafranski, Anderson was ordered held for a dangerousness hearing Tuesday to determine if he can be released on bail. Judge John Payne also revoked Anderson's bail in a pending case, effectively jailing him for 90 days.
A second suspect, Emilio Garcia-Cappas, 21, of Holyoke, pleaded not guilty Thursday to five charges, including carrying a loaded firearm without a license and possession of a large-capacity firearm in commission of a felony.
Garcia-Cappas, who was shot three times during the confrontation, is also being held for a dangerousness hearing Tuesday.
The two defendants allegedly knocked on the door of a home Wednesday afternoon and asked to speak to someone named Eric. When the homeowner and his girlfriend said nobody by that name lived there, Garcia-Cappas pulled a gun from his coat and aimed it at them, according to the arrest report.
The homeowner responded by drawing his own gun and shooting Garcia-Cappas, who stumbled back to his car and was driven to Mercy Medical Center for treatment. Anderson fled on foot, running toward Sycamore Street, the report said.
Garcia-Cappas was transferred to Baystate Medical Center, where he was treated for injuries not considered to be life-threatening.
The shooting remains under investigation, said Springfield police spokesman Ryan Walsh.
No additional details, including a possible motive for the confrontation, were provided during Anderson or Garcia-Cappas's arraignments.
At the detention hearings next week, prosecutors will argue that Anderson and Garcia-Cappas pose too great a risk to the alleged victims or the public to be released on bail.
Toronto police are asking for the public's help in identifying a woman pulled out of Lake Ontario in Etobicoke last week.
Police say they responded to a call for an unknown trouble on Aug. 10 at 5:15 p.m. in the area of Humber Bay Shores Park.
Paramedics say the woman was without vital signs when she was extracted from the water. She was later pronounced dead on the scene.
Toronto police Const. Craig Brister said police are not considering her death suspicious.
The woman is described as white between the ages of 55 to 70 years old, 5 foot 4 to 5 foot 6, 135 to 150 lbs., short grey hair, and brown eyes.
When will it end? The southeastern part of the United States and the nearby regions of Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean continue to be pummeled in a merciless, all but unprecedented way.
Tropical storm Nate set its sights on the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama as the holiday weekend (Columbus Day) approached. Ttates were under hurricane, storm surge and tropical storm watches Friday.
The consecutive nature of hurricanes and tropical storms is leaving no adequate time for recovery. There is nothing anyone can do but marshal whatever assistance the U.S. government, its military, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other agencies can muster.
No strangers to the ferocity of such events, New Orleans and Florida have been preparing for the onslaught. If anything can be learned from this set of natural calamities - Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and now Tropical Storm Nate - it's the need for as much preparation beforehand as possible, to mitigate the inevitable damage and hopefully eliminate the loss of human life.
What the government must avoid is putting these regions in competition with each other, a mistake already made in the response and comments related to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. All of our citizens deserve equal and prompt assistance. This is when a great nation must be great.
Hyperbole is often used when major storms and other natural disasters take place, but it is fair to say this hurricane season in this battered, devastated region is like none other. It is testing the resolve of its residents. It is also testing the ability of the United States of America to protect or assist its citizens under the most severe of circumstances.
It's tempting for this latest storm to cause discouragement or even inattention on the heels of three other calamities. That must not happen. Once again, our citizenry and our government will be called to help immediately, efficiently and compassionately.
We have done that sometimes, not always. This hurricane season provides a fundamental test of American compassion and readiness. Millions of Americans in a large swath of geography rely on our government and us.
Regardless of the growing enormity of the task, we cannot let them down.

A retired nurse saved his Jack Russell 's life by throwing himself to ground and BITING the dog that was trying to rip its throat out.
John Wood, 65, a bit down as hard as he could on the attacking mutt for at least 10 seconds, forcing it to let go.
John said his pet, Bobby, 11, would certainly have been killed if not for his intervention.
Even then, Bobby suffered very serious neck injuries requiring £1,000-worth of treatment.
(Image: Deadline News)
John was out for a walk with his pet in his hometown of Ferrybridge, West Yorkshire, on Monday when the terrifying incident happened.
The former nurse, who worked for the NHS for 37 years, was approached by a Rottweiler and another large, white dog, both of them off the lead.
He said: "The rottweiler came running round and started attacking Bobby from the back.
(Image: Deadline News)
"Bobby then tried to defend himself but the white dog jumps in and grabs Bobby by the throat. He was going to kill him so I started hitting him over the head with a stick. He still wouldn't let go."
He added: "The next thing, I leapt onto the ground and bit the dog on the flappy bit of its mouth. I bit and bit, just kept biting down for about ten seconds, until the dog finally let Bobby go.
"I wasn't going to let go, he was going to kill him. He would be dead if I didn't do it, there's no doubt about that."
Both attacking dogs backed off and John then realised how badly hurt his pet was.
(Image: Deadline News)
"He had torn all the muscle so they had to stitch that back up, and sew up all the flesh," said John.
"He's got a massive drain in his neck but we're taking this out today so he will be happy he can shake his head again."
John shared photographs of Bobby recovering at home since his operation showing cuts and stitches next to a large drain on his neck.
John revealed he had contacted police but was told they could not do anything as it was a dog on dog attack.
(Image: Deadline News)
Since the attack, John has refused to take his three-year-old grandson to the area over fears the dogs could attack again.
He is now hoping to hunt down the two dog owners - believed to be two young women - so they can repay him for the vet fees.
He added: "Those dogs should not be allowed out on a lead and they should have been wearing muzzles. Those dogs were totally out of control and the owners even seemed too small themselves to control them.
(Image: Deadline News)
"I used to have insurance but stopped it two years ago after reading in the small print I would have to pay 60% of the bill. So the last two years I've been putting that money away which paid for this.
"I want to track down the owners to pay me back the £1,000 in vet fees I had to pay. "
The images have attracted hundreds of comments from dog lovers.
(Image: Deadline News)
Charlotte Yelland said: "This is awful, so sorry to hear about your Bobby. There's some irresponsible dog owners out there. I hope you catch the people responsible."
Sharon Goodwin wrote: "Sorry to hear this hope your little dog is going to be ok. Hope you have reported them to the police. All dogs should be on a lead that could have been a child."
And Lyndsey Marron said: "Omg poor Bobby hope he gets well soon. Dogs like that should have a muzzle on could have been a child."

OTTAWA – Even with companies and politicians breathing a little easier after Justin Trudeau's first encounter with U.S. President Donald Trump, it remains to be seen what the two governments actually agreed to.
A day after the Trudeau-Trump tete-a-tete, questions on critical files remained unanswered — from trade, to infrastructure, to taxes, to pipelines.
Trudeau cabinet ministers acknowledged Tuesday that the Trump-related economic uncertainty had yet to dissipate.

On energy, Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said there's still a lot of unfinished work when it comes to reminding Americans that the two economies are highly integrated.
“I've been spending an awful lot of time on the telephone talking to people who are very close to those in a position of influence in the United States to make that argument,” Carr told reporters in Ottawa after a cabinet meeting.
“We're doing two things: we're making arguments and we're making friends — and then our friends will help us make the argument.”
Canada's crucial oil and gas industry has concerns about a possible border-adjustment tax as well as Trump's pledge to boost U.S. energy production — even as carbon pricing in Canada is poised to become more expensive. On the other hand, the president did sign an executive order advancing the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which would benefit the Alberta oilpatch.

In many ways, the joint statement released after the Trudeau-Trump meeting raised even more questions than it answered.
The document declared the governments would “encourage opportunities for companies in both countries” to create jobs through infrastructure investments, but it did not offer explicit comfort that Canada would be exempt from any Buy America provisions.
It mentioned the two sides would work together on labour mobility in various economic sectors. However, it didn't say how it would make that happen or whether it would come through the upcoming renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The statement said the two sides would continue talks on regulatory issues to make them more business friendly and to cut costs without compromising health, safety, and environmental standards. It did not provide details on how it would get there.
The joint declarations that follow meetings between U.S. presidents and Canadian prime ministers rarely include specifics and this one was no different.
However, the many unknowns surrounding Trump, and the potential for spillover into Canada, has created an intense thirst for detail.
Companies say they need to have confidence in the fine print before they can make big decisions in areas like investment.

On trade, business leaders said they felt some relief after Trump told reporters Monday that NAFTA would only be tweaked, rather than torn up, as he had promised on the campaign trail.
But they remained unsure what a Trump tweak might look like.
Parts of Corporate Canada has been bracing for the worst since Trump's unexpected election victory in November. The combination of his unpredictability and his protectionist vows has raised concerns across many sectors.

In particular, businesses are watching closely to see whether the U.S. will follow through on a proposed border-adjustment tax, which has many firms deeply concerned.
A new study released Tuesday warned that the border plan would inflict considerable damage on both economies.
The analysis by the C.D. Howe Institute think-tank said the plan would reduce bilateral trade in both directions and estimated it would shave nearly a full percentage point from Canada's economic growth.
They predicted it would also cut nearly 1.3 percentage points from U.S. economic growth.

On Monday in Washington, Trudeau also met top House lawmaker Paul Ryan, who has promoted the border-tax measure.
It's unclear, however, whether Trudeau was able to get some reassurance from Ryan on the future of the proposal.
When asked whether Trudeau learned more about the border-tax proposal, a spokeswoman in his office pointed to a brief statement that only said the prime minister discussed trade during his meeting with Ryan.
Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said Tuesday that the meetings in Washington confirmed her expectations the fate of the border-tax plan was uncertain.
“This is very much in the early stages and there is a very broad diversity of opinion in the United States around that,” Freeland told reporters in Ottawa.

“It's not appropriate for us to have a position on that until we see where the U.S. lands.”
She noted that the border-tax measure is part of a broader tax-reform plan.
Freeland also said talks surrounding NAFTA's renegotiation had yet to begin because appointees for the new U.S. secretary of commerce and trade representative positions had to be confirmed.
“Therefore, it's not possible for us to start the negotiations at a technical level,” she said. “Yesterday's conversation with the president was very productive. It's a good start.”
On infrastructure, federal officials believe the inclusion of the Gordie Howe international bridge in the joint statement was another sign the relationship was off to an encouraging start.
The officials believe that, at the very least, the bridge's mention was an indicator Trump's team won't create any obstacles to its construction.

The previous Conservative government ran into many political roadblocks as they sought its approval. Canada eventually had to agree to take on the financial risk from the bridge project.
Once built, the bridge between Windsor, Ont., and Detroit will relieve congestion at the busiest border crossing in the country.
On Tuesday, Infrastructure Minister Amarjeet Sohi sidestepped a question on whether Canadian firms would be exempt from any Buy America policies attached to U.S. investments.
“Both the United States and our country have a great emphasis on building infrastructure to grow our economy and create opportunities for workers on both sides of the border,” he said.

Qingyu Wei
The Macomb County Sheriffs Office has busted a couple of phone scam artists accused of targeting elderly residents and using the cash to buy and sell merchandise on internet.
Qingyu Wei, 27, and Xinfeng Zhu, 23, both of Troy, were arrested on one count of conducting a criminal enterprise, a 20-year felony, and two counts of false pretenses, a five-year felony.
Everyone knows someone who has received a suspicious phone call or email asking to send money, Macomb County Prosecutor Eric Smith said. Sadly, these scams target our seniors who are desperate to help out their loved ones.
According to a news release, the investigation began Feb. 21 when detectives from New York alerted detectives from the Sheriffs Office to criminal activity taking place in Macomb County.

The scam involved Wei and Zhu telling victims over the phone that a family member or friend was involved in an accident, taken to jail and needed bond money to be released.
Investigators said the scheme was an elaborate one that involved using others to pose as the family member or act as an attorney.
The victims, ranging in ages 66 to 80, were instructed to buy gift cards from Target to pay the bond. The victims were then told to call Wei or Zhu and give them the gift card numbers and pin numbers from the Target gift cards.
Police said Wei and Zhu would go to a Target store and purchase eBay and Steam gift cards with the Target cards.
Between Jan. 29 and Feb. 24, the suspects purchased $10,600 in gift cards from a Target store on Hall Road in Macomb Township with money illegally obtained under false pretenses, police said. The suspects used the money to buy high-end merchandise that was sold via the internet to customers overseas.
Detectives executed a search warrant March 12 at the home of Wei and Zhu in Troy, where they seized electronics, vehicles, cash and a plethora of merchandise purchased with illegal proceeds.
In the release, Macomb County Sheriff Anthony Wickersham said Telephone scams are real crimes that happen every day. The best way to not become a victim is to learn how to protect yourself from them.
Wickersham advised the public to never give out personal information over the phone such as credit card or Social Security numbers, and verify information provided from a caller.
Prosecutor Smith called scam artists a challenging topic.
However, what is so alarming in this particular case is the intricate scheme these defendants used to target senior citizens who resided vast distances from one another throughout the country, he said.
The suspects were arraigned March 15 in 41A District Court in Shelby Township. They each are being held on a $250,000 bond, and will have to surrender their passports before being released.
A probable because conference has been scheduled for 8:30 a.m. on March 29.
Ahmedabad: All the accused in a case filed by BJP president Amit Shah's son Jay Shah over an article published by news portal The Wire relating to his company denied the allegation of criminal defamation against them on Saturday, according to Jay Shah's lawyer.
Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate SK Gadhvi recorded the statements of the accused on Saturday, his lawyer Prakash Patel said.
With the accused denying the allegation that they indulged in criminal defamation, the trial will start from the next hearing on 17 March with Jay Shah's examination, he said.
Jay Shah had moved court alleging criminal defamation by the accused after the article published by the website claimed his company's turnover grew exponentially following the BJP-led government coming to power at the Centre in 2014.
Shah filed the criminal defamation case against the author of the article Rohini Singh, founding editors of the news portal Siddharth Varadarajan, Siddharth Bhatia and MK Venu, managing editor Monobina Gupta, public editor Pamela Philipose and the owner of the portal, Foundation for Independent Journalism.
The accused had earlier moved the Gujarat High Court to get the case quashed, but got no relief.
Jay Shah has separately filed a civil defamation suit of Rs 100 crore against the website over the article.
Police are trying to identify a man who reportedly exposed his genitals to people in another vehicle while driving in southeast Calgary on Saturday, May 12.
The victims said they were driving on Stoney Trail and approaching the Peigan Trail turnoff when a minivan pulled up beside their car.
When the victims looked over, the driver of the minivan exposed his genitals to them, according to police.
The victims tried to slow down to get the minivan's licence plate but he quickly swerved off the road onto Peigan Trail and disappeared.
The suspect is described as being approximately 45-years-old with short grey hair and a beard.
The vehicle the suspect was driving was a mid-2000s light blue Dodge Caravan with a white roof rack.
Anyone with information about the suspect or the incident is asked to call Crime
U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon has instructed both sides in the trial — AT&T and the Department of Justice — to limit what they say in public about the case. Stephenson said he wanted to abide by the judge's order. The deal wound up in court because the Justice Department sued AT&T in November to block the deal. Leon's decision is expected by June 12.
Whether Matt Barnes likes it or not, his ex, Gloria Govan, and former teammate Derek Fisher are a real couple out here. And their love only seems to be growing.
Fisher and Govan rang in the New Year together, adorably dressed up in Winnie the Pooh and Piglet pajamas, respectively, with nothing but smiles on their faces. Soon after Gloria waxed poetic about not spelling love, but having to "FEEL" it, Fisher reciprocated, saying, 2017 is about "living more, loving more, laughing more" via his own Instagram post.
We guess they couldn't care less about Barnes's possible feelings about their relationship, even after he attacked Fisher in a notorious 2015 incident. They're choosing happiness in 2017! Days before the ball dropped, Fisher and Govan shot down rumored reports about them expecting a baby. But with lovey-dovey moments like these, hey, you never know what's in store for the future.

A PARTY for past and present staff and customers was staged by Gary and Jacqui Salt to mark the end of an era at the Horse and Jockey pub at Knighton, as they leave after 28 years of owning and running the pub.
The couple bought the pub with members of their family in 1989 and since then have transformed the traditional pub into an award winning guest house with eight en-suite rooms and a restaurant.
The couple, originally from Nottingham, have run the business on their own for the last 15 years and their three children were all born at the Jockey and all worked in the pub and restaurant before moving away with two of them going into the hospitality trade.
The pub has now been sold and to mark the end of their time at the Jockey, Gary and Jacqui put on a party for all their staff past and present and all their customers over the years. At the party there was live music throughout the afternoon and evening and the pub was totally packed.
“We have seen three generations, some were not even born when we first came to Knighton. It has been lovely sharing our lives with the locals and to have shared in so many of their celebrations in this lovely town, Knighton will always be our home.

COLUMBUS, Ohio, May 30, 2018 (SEND2PRESS NEWSWIRE) — Addiction recovery imprint Zephyr Bookshelf announced today that it's publishing a brand-new title this winter: “Taming the Wild Things in My Head” by first-time author David H. Griggs. The memoir is equal parts harrowing, heartbreaking and hopeful – a compelling collection of stories that charts Griggs's impossible trajectory from an otherwise normal upbringing to the darkest depths of substance abuse.
From meth-addled machine gunning in the National Guard to alcoholic sex-crazed blackouts in Japan to crack binges in San Francisco during the dot-com era, Griggs paints a beautifully raw portrait of addiction with both delicate and deliberately reckless brushstrokes.
“What truly makes a recovery story unique is how it's told,” Zephyr Bookshelf publisher Paul Fuhr says. “'Taming the Wild Things in My Head' is a deceptively complex account of one man's addiction. Griggs has plunged you into the chaos of his past. We couldn't be prouder to help put this story out there.”
Fuhr discovered the memoir via Anna David's coaching program for writers, which walks 10 students at a time through the process of writing and selling their book proposals. Out of each group of 10, David and a committee select one author to receive a meeting with agent Alexis Hurley of Inkwell Management and publisher Fuhr. While there's no guarantee of publication, Fuhr leapt at the opportunity to be the first to publish Griggs.
Griggs, an Oregon-based attorney, is a bit shell-shocked by his sudden transition into a creative career, admitting he applied for the coaching program solely so he could find catharsis through unearthing his most challenging experiences.
“After more than forty years of keeping dark secrets buried deep within me, I had two choices,” Griggs says. “I could either lose my sanity and likely die an active addict, or I could release them. Fortunately, I was guided to release them.”
David admits that selecting Griggs for the meeting with Hurley and Fuhr was a bit like Sophie's Choice. “I somehow keep ending up with the most talented students I could have imagined,” she says. “They're all survivors who have incredible stories to tell. But ultimately, I felt I had no choice but to help the world discover this book.”
Zephyr Bookshelf expects to release “Taming the Wild Things in My Head” this Christmas.

Sembabule Council Wants UPE Schools Privatised
By Moses Batte
Sembabule District councillors are mooting a proposal to have all run down Universal Primary Education (UPE) schools privatised to improve academic standards.
During a council sitting on Monday, the councillors detasted the poor state of some UPE schools in the district such as pupils studying under tree sheds.
They therefore proposed that such schools be put in the hands of private proprietors who can effectively manage them.
Sembabule District has a total of 179 public primary schools but most of them are poorly managed.
Robert Ambikiri, one of the councillors, who also chairs the district works and technical service committee, while presenting a report from his committee, said; “the committee members recommended that Katikamu, Keirasitya and Kanjunju primary schools in Lugusuulu Sub-county be privatised to enhance good service delivery.”
The recommendation was supported by Ms Jowelia Mukabalisa, a councillor representing Lwebitakuli Sub-county and district secretary for health and education.
Peter Semaganda, a resident of Sembabule Town showed support for the proposal saying that private schools are performing better than public schools because there is close supervision and monitoring from the proprietors.
“I know private schools will charge them some money which is not the case in public schools, but parents are ready to pay if they receive quality services,” Semaganda said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's annual consumer price inflation picked up in July after easing for three straight months as a decline in food prices abated, but it remained well below the central bank's central target.
The consumer price index, the main policy target for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), rose 2.36 percent in July from a year earlier, data released by the Ministry of Statistics showed on Monday.
The rise was faster than the 1.87 percent forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.
Inflation was 1.46 percent in June - the slowest pace since India started releasing retail inflation data in January 2012 based on combined data for rural and urban consumers.
Analysts said rising inflation reduced the chances of another rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India, which has a central inflation target of 4 percent.
"Policy rates have likely plateaued for now, with room for rate cuts requiring a sharp downward drift in core inflation or growth slump in FYH2," said Radhika Rao, group economist at DBS Bank.
Disinflationary pressures allowed the RBI to cut its main policy rate early this month by 25 basis points to 6 percent, the lowest since November 2010.
It was the first easing by an Asian central bank this year. But the RBI retained its "neutral" stance and warned inflation could pick up again.
BOUNTIFUL RAINS
Bountiful monsoon rains this year are expected to deliver another bumper harvest, further dampening food prices, which contribute nearly 50 percent of the consumer price index.
Retail food prices contracted for a third straight month, falling 0.29 percent in July from a year ago, compared with a 2.12 percent fall the previous month.
The wholesale price index rose 1.88 percent in July from a year earlier, compared with an increase of 0.63 percent in July 2016, government data showed.
The RBI expects retail inflation could accelerate to 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent in October-December.
That contrasts with the view of the government's chief economic adviser, Arvind Subramanian, who argued last week that India was undergoing a structural economic shift that will keep inflation below 4 percent through to the end of this fiscal year in March.
"It's too early to say if inflation in India is undergoing a structural shift," said Puneet Pal, head of fixed income at BNP Paribas Mutual Fund, adding that although inflation should stay below target, a short-term rise in food prices was a "caveat".
"I think the RBI is cautious, but not behind the curve when it comes to cutting rates."
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England will find itself facing a question next week that is set to trouble many other central banks this year - does an unexpectedly strong global economy mean it should press ahead with raising interest rates?
For the BoE - and its Indian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts - the answer over the next few days is likely to be no, as domestic uncertainties for now outweigh the inflationary pressure of a powerful global upswing.
But the odds of moves further away from the emergency level stimulus of the financial crisis are shortening. In government bond markets, yields on 10-year U.S., German and British debt have leapt by more than 30 basis points since the start of the year and two-year U.S. yields are their highest since 2008.
BoE Governor Mark Carney takes centre stage on Thursday, when he will set out the central bank's thinking on Britain's prospects, barely a year before the country is due to leave the European Union.
No economist thinks a BoE rate hike is coming next week, according to Reuters polls. But markets see a 50 percent chance that there will be another move in May, a relatively quick follow-up to the BoE rate hike in November, the first for a decade.
UBS's chief economist, Arend Kapteyn, recently changed his mind to predict a May rate rise due to recent strength in the global economy - assuming that Prime Minister Theresa May can get a temporary Brexit deal before then.
“We think the data lines up for a brief window where they can hike,” he said.
Much later and there is a risk that the domestic economy may sour, as businesses hold off on investment and hiring in the months running up to Britain's departure from the EU.
Politics is also likely to exert its sway over the Reserve Bank of India's thinking next week, after an expansionary budget on Thursday which boosted rural spending and predicted that India would become the world's fastest-growing major economy.
A decision to jack up farmers' production subsidies was especially likely to intensify the RBI's worries about above-target inflation, economists said.
Going the other way is Brazil, which is likely to cut rates on Wednesday as the country slowly pulls out of more than two years of economic malaise.
SERVICES SMILE
UBS has just upgraded its global growth forecasts to pencil in expansion of 4.1 percent for this year - which would be the fastest since 2011 - after 3.9 percent growth in 2017.
More evidence of the strength of the global recovery is likely to come on Monday, with a raft of services PMIs for advanced economies.
Manufacturing data previously showed factory activity hitting multi-year highs, and an early version of the services PMI for the euro zone rose to its highest since 2006.
U.S. data on Friday showed the biggest annual rise in hourly wages since 2009.
“The activity data at the beginning of next week should go some way to confirming that the world economy started 2018 on the right foot,” HSBC economist James Pomeroy said.
Further confirmation was likely to come from Chinese trade data and German industrial orders, he added.
Overall, open economies such as Australia and New Zealand should not focus too much on current below-target inflation and prepare to raise rates in the second half of the year, he said.
“I think this is a global theme, but will be much more acute in those countries where you have financial stability concerns,” he said, highlighting a rise in household debt.
For Kapteyn of UBS, the slide in the U.S. dollar - which has fallen 4 percent so far this year on a trade-weighted basis .DXY - made the case much less obvious for rate rises outside the United States because it will ease inflation pressures.
More than usual, survey data in advanced economies looked too good to be true.
“You are seeing very strong growth data, but very little price or wage pressure. The volatility in currencies is dwarfing the reduction in slack,” he said.
By contrast, new Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whose four-year term starts on Saturday, may have to raise rates more often than the three times planned for this year - especially if the U.S. Congress loosens the fiscal purse-strings.
“Dollar weakness is reducing the freedom of the Fed. They're going to become very, very sensitive to any upward surprise in growth or wage forecasts. For the rest of the world, it's largely the opposite,” Kapteyn said.
TORONTO -
Ontario's fiscal watchdog says the Liberal government will run a deficit this fiscal year, despite claims it has balanced the budget.
In a new report Monday, the Financial Accountability Office said the Liberals will run a $4 billion deficit in 2017-2018, and will continue to be in the red over the next few years.
More moderate growth in revenues and the increasing fiscal impact of the province's Fair Hydro Plan, which cuts electricity rates by 25 per cent, will take their toll on Ontario's books the report notes. It also says a long-simmering accounting dispute between the Liberal government and Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk over how to count two public sector pension plans on the ledger is contributing to uncertainty.
“We've been very consistent that because of a number of factors we think the deficit will re-emerge,” said FAO chief economist David West. “Now, with this accounting debate it will become more significant.”
The Liberals presented a balanced budget in the spring, a year ahead of the provincial election, and have promised to keep the books in balance through the next couple of years.The FAO, however, projects the government's budget deficit will grow to $9.8 billion in 2021-2022.
“The government is out borrowing this money,” West said. “This current year they're going to borrow $23 billion in the markets. That's going to rise to $45 billion in the coming years.”
The FAO also said the government's new hydro plan will add $3.2 billion to the budget deficit by 2021-2022.
Last year Lysyk questioned the province's decision to include a pair of public pensions — the Ontario Public Service Employee's Union Pension Plan and the Ontario Teacher's Pension Plan — as assets on its balance sheet.
The FAO said in its report that since the government has not adopted the auditor's recommended accounting for both the pension assets, and with the addition of the Fair Hydro Plan, it is becoming more difficult for legislators and the public to assess the government's fiscal projections.
Sen. Kamala Harris with Syrian refugees at the Zaatari camp in Jordan.
Sen. Kamala Harris spent the first week of the April recess in Iraq and Jordan during her first trip overseas as a member of Congress.
It is common for representatives and senators not to publicize overseas trips until they return, particularly if they are visiting a potentially dangerous area.
In Iraq, Harris met with California service members. In Jordan, she visited with Syrian refugees in the Zaatari camp. The camp holds about 80,000 refugees, according to the United Nations refugee agency.
Harris serves on the Senate Select Intelligence Committee, which organized the trip, and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.
She wasn't the only member of California's delegation traveling overseas last week. Reps. Juan Vargas (D-San Diego) and Darrell Issa (R-Vista) were also in the Middle East, making stops in Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon, and Rep. Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena) visited Japan and South Korea.
RENTON, Wash. -- Seattle Seahawks rookie defensive lineman Malik McDowell issued an apology Monday, saying he's "embarrassed" by the actions that led to his arrest on a disorderly conduct charge.
McDowell, 22, was arrested early Sunday morning after a dispute at an Atlanta-area nightclub.
"I am embarrassed by the situation and my actions on Saturday," McDowell wrote in a statement posted to Twitter. "I would like to apologize to the Atlanta Police Department, SL Lounge, the entire Seattle Seahawks organization and my teammates. I am a young man who made a mistake and am constantly working towards getting better."
The Seahawks had no immediate comment on McDowell's arrest when news of it broke just before kickoff of their game Sunday at Jacksonville. Coach Pete Carroll said Monday that he and general manager John Schneider met separately with McDowell since the incident and that McDowell is "very remorseful."
Editor's Picks NFL: No bans for Seahawks for actions vs. Jags A league official told ESPN's Adam Schefter that no Seahawks players will be suspended for their actions at the end of the team's loss to the Jaguars on Sunday.
Seattle's McDowell arrested after club incident Seattle Seahawks rookie defensive lineman Malik McDowell, who hasn't played this season due to a concussion, was arrested early Sunday morning for disorderly conduct after an argument at a nightclub. 1 Related
"He got in a situation and made a mistake and hopefully this will be a learning experience for him," Carroll said. "I don't know much more than that about it. We just talked about it a bit, but I know he felt really bad representing in that manner."
The incident stemmed from McDowell contending that he paid $600 for bottles of alcohol and VIP seating at the SL Lounge, despite a friend telling him he hadn't paid, according to the incident report that was first obtained by TMZ. McDowell caused a disturbance by pouring bottles of liquor into an ice bucket inside the club. After he was removed, he got into a shouting match with police officers, according to TMZ.
"I repeatedly had to give him instructions and at one point he threw himself down on the ground in a tantrum," one of the officers wrote in a copy of the report obtained by USA Today Sports. "He immediately accused me of stealing money from him, while I began to search his person, before placing him inside my vehicle, as we are trained to do. I tried to reason with him but to no avail."
McDowell, the Seahawks' top draft pick, was not with the team in Jacksonville because he's on the non-football injury list. McDowell has been sidelined since he suffered what the team has called a severe concussion in a summer ATV accident. He's not expected to play at any point this season.
Chosen in the second round out of Michigan State, McDowell was expected to contribute right away as an interior pass-rusher in sub packages. The Seahawks said their interest in trading for Sheldon Richardson began in earnest when it became clear that McDowell was going to be unavailable for an extended period of time as a result of his accident.
Asked if the team will need to keep closer tabs on McDowell in light of his arrest, Carroll said: "I think we're definitely going to work to help him in every way that we can. We've already talked about that. Let's hope that this isn't an indicator of things to come. I hope that he has turned with this experience. He sounds very much intending to do that. We'll see what happens."

WASHINGTON – His last vacation behind him, President Barack Obama is entering the closing stretch of his presidency, an eleventh-hour push to tie up loose ends and put finishing touches on his legacy before handing the reins to President-elect Donald Trump.
Obama returned to Washington midday Monday from Hawaii with less than three weeks left. His final days will largely be consumed by a bid to protect his endangered health care law, a major farewell speech and the ongoing handover of power to Trump.

In an email to supporters on Monday, Obama said his valedictory speech on Jan. 10 follows a tradition set in 1796 when the first president, George Washington, spoke to the American people for the last time in office. The speech will take place at McCormick Place, a giant convention centre in Obama's hometown of Chicago.
“I'm thinking about them as a chance to say thank you for this amazing journey, to celebrate the ways you've changed this country for the better these past eight years, and to offer some thoughts on where we all go from here,” Obama said.
Obama's chief speechwriter, Cody Keenan, travelled with Obama to Hawaii and spent much of the trip working on the speech. The Chicago trip will likely be Obama's last outside Washington as president and will be included a “family reunion” for Obama's former campaign staffers.

Obama is also planning last-minute commutations and pardons, White House officials said, in line with his second-term effort to cut sentences for inmates given unduly harsh sentences for drug crimes. Though prominent offenders like Edward Snowden and Rod Blagojevich are also asking for leniency, Obama's final acts of clemency are expected to remain focused on drug offenders whose plight Obama tried but failed to address through criminal justice reform.
WATCH: Obama thanks Americans in last New Year's Eve message
After taking office eight years ago, Obama and his aides were effusive in their praise for how Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, helped his team take over the massive federal bureaucracy. Obama has vowed to pass on the favour to Trump. But the transition hasn't been without incident.
The two teams have clashed over the Trump team's requests for information Obama aides fear could be used to eliminate government employees who worked on Obama priorities like climate change and minority rights overseas. Trump's team, meanwhile, has been frustrated by Obama's attempts to box Trump in with parting moves to block ocean drilling, declare new monuments and further empty out the Guantanamo Bay prison.
WATCH: Trump slams Obama over treatment of Israel, reverses take on presidential transition
While on his annual vacation in Oahu, Obama asserted himself forcefully on two foreign policy issues that put him in direct conflict with Trump. Obama directed the U.S. to defy tradition by allowing a U.N. Security Council resolution criticizing Israel on settlements to pass, then slapped Russia with sweeping penalties over U.S. allegations of hacking.
The final days are Obama's last chance to define his presidency before his loses the bully pulpit and cedes his legacy to historians. For Obama, helping Americans understand how his two terms have reshaped American life is even more critical amid concerns that Trump may undo much of what he accomplished, including the health law.
As Trump and Republicans vow to gut the Affordable Care Act, Democrats are working to devise a strategy to protect the law by exploiting GOP divisions about how to replace it. To that end, Obama will travel Wednesday to the Capitol to meet with House and Senate Democrats, likely his last meeting with his party's lawmakers as president.
His administration is also working feverishly to finish up regulations in the pipeline that Obama hopes can be completed in the final days, perhaps increasing the likelihood his policies carry over. But the closer it gets to Trump's inauguration, the harder those tasks become.

Though Obama remains president until Jan. 20, the White House can't process the departure of all its staffers on a single day. So this week Obama aides will start “offloading,” turning in their Blackberries and shutting down their computers for the last time, leaving a smaller staff on hand for the final days.
Obama must also prepare to become a private citizen for the first time in two decades. An office of the former president must be stood up, and Obama's family will be making arrangements to move into a rental home in Northwest Washington where they plan to stay until youngest daughter Sasha finishes high school.
The Obamas have long lamented how the presidency denied them freedom and privacy, with first lady Michelle Obama likening the White House to “a really nice prison.” But on their last Hawaii vacation, the first family took time out to visit Breakout Waikiki, where visitors are “trapped” in a room together and must try, as a team, to escape.

ISLAMABAD - The Supreme Court yesterday directed Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf to provide all the account books and bank statements of the last four years, which it supplied to the chartered accountant for preparation of the party's audit report.
The chief justice said the PTI account statements filed in the Election Commission of Pakistan did not show the details of foreign collections given to the chartered accountant. “We want to see account books containing foreign collections, when the company was created, what its nature was and whether those documents were supplied to the chartered accountant for preparation of the audit report submitted to the ECP,” said the chief justice, while heading a three-judge bench which heard PML-N leader Hanif Abbasi's petition against PTI Chairman Imran Khan and General Secretary Jehangir Tareen.
Akram Sheikh, representing the PML-N leader, contended that the manner in which the PTI was submitting the documents showed they were not tracing the documents, but preparing them.
The chief justice remarked it takes time to arrange old documents. He said they would examine in case of any forgery. “We want a thorough probe,” the CJP said and added the Supreme Court had done the fact finding which was more than the investigation.
Ibrahim Satti, appearing on behalf of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), without taking name of Imran Khan, said the head of a political party who could become prime minister or president of Pakistan if submits certificate in the ECP that his party has received no foreign funding and it is proven otherwise, then it is a serious issue.
The counsel contended that the political parties should mention funds generated locally and abroad in their account statements.
He submitted the account statements of the PTI for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and said the statements of 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 would be filed by the next hearing.
Justice Faisal Arab questioned whether it was not the job of the ECP to check the foreign funding of the parties in accordance with the Political Parties Order 2002.
Ibrahim Satti said under the law the political parties had to disclose their local and foreign funding. He admitted the PTI account statement mentions money in US dollars, but said they had not disclosed whether those funds were from the prohibited sources or not.
The counsel informed the court that if a political party works against the sovereignty of Pakistan, it could be banned, but if a party had received foreign funding, the ECP could stop it from contesting the elections besides confiscating the funds.
Satti added the reason for stopping a foreign-funded party from participating in elections was that its members would sit in the parliament if they won the elections.
The counsel admitted that in the past the ECP had not scrutinised the parties' foreign funding and acted only like a post office. He said the ECP took action on the complaint of former PTI leader Akbar S Babar. He further said that in the past the religious political parties had received funds from abroad.
Justice Umar Atta Bandial said in this case the ECP had received information, and under the rules the commission was supposed to keep a check on foreign funding and ask the parties to disclose its sources of funding. “Why did the ECP wait for the complaint and why did it not proceed on its own?” Justice Bandial said. He added the ECP should do its duty according to the law.
The court has issued notices to Imran Khan's counsel to file reply.
JEMIMA'S DOCUMENTS
SUBMITTED IN SC
INP adds: PTI chief Imran Khan on Wednesday submitted a money trail of Bani Gala property being received from Jemima in Supreme Court.
Sources said Jemima has asked the authorities not to disclose the details regarding bank accounts, letters from Luxembourg bank and other records.
According to the documents, Jemima transferred $2.17 lakh in April 2002 and $2.75 lakh in July 2002 in the account of Rashid Khan while she also gave $1 lakh on January 22, 2003.

Additional law enforcement members will be stationed around Fenway Park and more rigorous security protocol in place at entryways this weekend.
The Red Sox and Boston Police Department revealed the plans in response to a Boston Globe inquiry spurred by news Thursday concerning Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock's suggestive internet into the city and, specifically, Fenway.
"We just have information that he was on possible sites looking at Boston," Boston Police Commissioner William Evans told reporters Thursday. "There's nothing to indicate he made it here or he never stepped foot in Boston. All we know is he was looking at sites in the area of Fenway Park."
The information, said Evans, came from the FBI.
Mayor Marty Walsh, speaking to the press as well, added, "This potentially could have been our city, but thank God it wasn't. I have full faith and confidence in the work the police department does."
The measures will include more detail officers in the streets and tactical teams stationed in the area, according to The Globe.
The Red Sox organization is asking fans to show up to games early and plan for a larger-than-usual traffic glut. Doors to the park open two hours prior to Sunday's game.
With a nasty and partisan confirmation battle behind him, Justice Neil Gorsuch took his seat on the nation's highest court on Monday and quickly proved himself to be an active, persistent questioner.
As the court buzzer sounded, Gorsuch emerged from behind the red velvet curtains with his eight colleagues and took his seat at the far right of the bench, no pun intended. (That's where the most junior justice sits, regardless of his or her politics.)
Despite his white hair, Gorsuch looked for all the world like a kid on his first day of high school, proud to be with the big guys, and sitting tall, with a tiny grin on his face.
Chief Justice John Roberts welcomed Gorsuch to "our common calling." Then it was off to the races with three cases interesting only to true legal nerds.
Indeed, the justices were the liveliest looking people in the courtroom, though Justice Samuel Alito at one point could be seen eyes closed, rocking gently in his high-backed chair.
All three cases involved technical and convoluted points of law that, to say the least, are not made for easy or interesting translation. But the newest justice was not shy.
Eleven minutes into the morning session, he asked a string of questions in a case involving which court or courts should hear discrimination and civil service claims brought by government employees.
Gorsuch repeatedly suggested it would be "a lot simpler" or "a lot easier if we just follow the text of the statute." But as the lawyers on both sides and other justices pointed out, the statute has multiple provisions that are interdependent, and nothing about them is simple or easy.
"This is unbelievably complicated," lamented Alito. "The one thing about this case that seems perfectly clear to me is that nobody who's not a lawyer — and no ordinary lawyer — could read these statutes and figure out what they are supposed to do."
"Who wrote this statute?" he asked plaintively. "Somebody who takes pleasure out of pulling the wings off flies?"
Justice Sonia Sotomayor seemed to agree.
"If we go down your route, and I'm writing the opinion — which I hope I'm not," Sotomayor said while glancing in the direction of Chief Justice Roberts, who generally assigns the opinions.
At this point, Gorsuch again suggested the simple solution is to just read the words in the statute, but Gorsuch had a relatively novel idea of what a statute means when it says to apply one provision "subject to" another provision of the law.
Justice Elena Kagan noted that the court has had a contrary interpretation for decades. To adopt a new interpretation, she said, would be "a kind of revolution ... to the extent you can have a revolution in this kind of case."
Gorsuch was a less enthusiastic participant in the next two arguments, but he again focused on the "plain language" of the statutes in his questioning. In the second case, involving who can intervene in a property rights case, Gorsuch asked no questions of the lawyer on one side, Neal Katyal, who had testified for him at his confirmation hearing.
Gorsuch did not have much time to prepare for the 13 cases to be argued over the next two weeks.
He was sworn in on April 10, leaving him a week to prepare for the current and final round of cases of this Supreme Court term. Such short turnaround time is not uncommon, though hardly desirable.
Chief Justice Roberts had six days to prepare after his swearing-in. Justice Alito had three weeks. Justice Anthony Kennedy had four days. Justice Clarence Thomas, 10 days. And Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan all took their oaths in August, so they had about two months to prep for their first oral arguments.
Though already a justice, Gorsuch did not participate last week in the court's weekly conference at which the eight not only discuss and vote on previously argued cases but decide which cases to hear in the future. Gorsuch would not have been eligible to vote on cases that were heard before he was sworn in, but he could have voted and will vote on which cases to hear in the future.
There are about 10 cases apparently being held, likely awaiting a decisive vote from Gorsuch on whether to grant review.
It takes the votes of four justices to agree to hear a case; the speculation is that some of the cases still in the queue need one more vote to get the four needed for review.

Staff at Analog Coffee on 17 Avenue in downtown Calgary have been feeling a little jittery lately and it's not from too much caffeine. The building at the corner of 17 Avenue and 7 street has been shaking from heavy equipment working.
“Last week with the heavy equipment has been probably the toughest. It's loud and there's a lot going on,” supervisor Josh Albers said.
“It's necessary, but it closes down our patio space. One day you'll have water just sort of flooding over everything.”

But starting Thursday night, the construction work stops and all of 17 Avenue will be opened up again for July and August.
City crews have been rebuilding the road and upgrading utilities for months, meaning traffic was shut down between 4 Street and 7 Street with the exception of sidewalks.
“I think it will be a very positive situation,” Esther Kelly with the 17 Avenue Retail and Entertainment District Business Improvement Area said.
“It will allow [businesses] to recoup some of the losses they have seen over the last few months,”
The summer break is a change from last year when businesses further east along the street endured a construction all summer long.
“This year we worked really hard to maintain balance between what the community needs and what the businesses need and what the project needs so we can deliver this project successfully on time,” City of Calgary spokesperson Anna Melnick said.
The 17 Avenue Business Improvement Area said compared to pre-construction days this year, sales at restaurants and shops along 17 Avenue are down 40 per cent. While that is still tough for small businesses to swallow, it's an improvement from the 70 per cent decline they experienced when construction began on the project in early 2017.
“The change is obviously a lot better than what some of the businesses were experiencing last year, but it's still a ways to go and small businesses rely on their clients and customers to come and support them,” Kelly said. “We welcome everyone down to the avenue to do that regardless of construction.”

For the first time, the business district will be hosting parties on the two Saturdays during the 2018 Calgary Stampede at Tomkins Park as a way to say thank you to loyal customers and to bring back ones who may have been deterred by construction.
Construction starts again in September between 7 Street and 9 Street with the entire project expected to wrap up at 14 street in 2020.

GAZA CITY - Israeli forces stopped and seized control of a Palestinian protest boat Tuesday, organisers said, as those aboard sought to demonstrate against the Jewish state's blockade of Gaza.
The incident occurred amid high tensions in the Gaza Strip after militants fired dozens of mortars in the direction of Israel, whose military retaliated by hitting dozens of targets. The boat, carrying sick Gazans and those unable to find work, was stopped by Israeli forces several kilometres (miles) out at sea, Salah Abdul Atti, one of the organisers, told AFP. “Israeli forces surrounded it and intercepted it,” he said, adding communications had been lost with the boat.
He said they had been informed the boat and its passengers would be taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod.
There was no immediate confirmation from the Israeli army and the circumstances of the incident were unclear. Army spokesman Jonathan Conricus said the boat was making an “illegal attempt to break a legal naval blockade that we have imposed on Gaza ever since the terrorist organisation called Hamas seized power.”
Organisers said they were seeking to highlight the impact of the blockade on Gaza's two million residents.
One main boat carrying around 20 people accompanied by a group of smaller ones had set off from the fishermen's port in Gaza City on Tuesday morning.
There were conflicting statements about whether the boats would seek to break Israel's blockade, which currently allows them to travel nine nautical miles (16 kilometres) off the coast.
Organisers said the boat was 12 nautical miles off the coast when contact was lost. Under the Oslo Agreements of the 1990s, fishermen are supposed to be allowed to fish up to 20 nautical miles off the coast.
In 2010, Israeli commandos killed nine Turkish activists when they raided a six-ship flotilla trying to reach the Gaza Strip in defiance of the blockade. Another activist died years later.
The botched raid angered Turkey and saw it cut off ties with Israel until 2016.
Separately Tuesday, Israel's army said some dozens of mortar shells were launched toward Israel from the Gaza Strip, with most intercepted by the country's air defence system. It appeared to be the largest such barrage from Gaza targeting Israel since a 2014 war.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to respond “powerfully” to the mortar fire and the army struck more than 30 “military targets” in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday afternoon.
Army spokesman Jonathan Conricus told journalists the rocket and mortar fire at Israel was the most extensive since a 2014 war as was Israel's response.
“We just concluded a significant aerial strike where we struck more than 30 different military targets belonging to terrorist organisations,” Conricus said.
“Amongst those a tunnel and different components of military infrastructure belonging to Hamas and to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.”
The Gaza Strip has been under Israeli blockade for more than a decade, with Israel saying it is necessary to prevent the Palestinian enclave's militant Hamas rulers from obtaining means to attack.
The boat protest comes after weeks of deadly demonstrations and clashes along the Gaza-Israel border, beginning on March 30.
The protests have called for Palestinians who fled or were expelled in the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation to be allowed to return to their former homes now inside Israel.
They peaked on May 14, when at least 61 Palestinians were killed as tens of thousands of Gazans protested and clashes erupted on the same day of the US transfer of its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
Demonstrations and clashes have continued at a low level since then. At least 121 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the unrest.

LOS ANGELES-Production has begun on the sequel to smash hit "Maleficent," Disney announced with Elle Fanning and Angelina Jolie reprising their roles as Sleeping Beauty and her conflicted surrogate mother.
The movie is being filmed at Pinewood Studios, near London and in locations around Britain, the world's largest movie studio said in statement.
"It's bring your mom to work day on the Maleficent2 set," 20-year-old Fanning ("Trumbo," "The Beguiled") joked in an Instagram post that had been shared a quarter of a million times within an hour.
Alongside the message, she posted a picture of her in front of a laughing Jolie, who was in the famous "Maleficent" horns, as well as a pair of sunglasses and a toweling bathrobe.
"Maleficent," a modern retelling of the life of Sleeping Beauty's arch-nemesis, cast an instant spell on audiences in 2014, debuting at the top of the North American box office and going on to gross more than $750 million worldwide.
Joining Fanning and Jolie for the latest adventure are Oscar nominees Michelle Pfeiffer ("Dangerous Liaisons," "Ant-Man and the Wasp") and Chiwetel Ejiofor ("12 Years a Slave," "Doctor Strange").
Disney also confirmed that acclaimed British stage and screen actor Robert Lindsay ("Wimbledon") would be among the newcomers, while Sam Riley, Imelda Staunton, Juno Temple and Lesley Manville return from the original movie.
In the sequel, directed by Joachim Ronning ("Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"), Disney's most notorious villain continues to explore her complex relationship with Princess Aurora, the soon-to-be queen, as they form alliances against new adversaries.
Fan reaction on social media was mostly positive, with much of the excitement being generated over the addition of screen legend Pfeiffer, 60, to the cast.
Disney began scouring its back catalog in the 1990s for animated classics that it could turn into live-action remakes - a strategy that has so far netted several billion dollars.
Tim Burton's "Dumbo," Guy Ritchie's "Aladdin" and Jon Favreau's "The Lion King" are all due for release next year, while "The Little Mermaid" will see Lin-Manuel Miranda of "Hamilton" fame collaborating with legendary Disney composer Alan Menken. Two remakes of "Peter Pan" are in the works along with new versions of "Fantasia," "Pinocchio," "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" and "The Sword in the Stone."
Some songs are spells. The ones Nandi Rose Plunkett casts as Half Waif conjure meaning out of everyday human experience. Through her lens, a walk through the garden, a lover's spat, or a moment alone becomes a catalyst for self-reckoning and sometimes, revelation. On Lavender, Half Waif's third full-length album and most cohesive collection to date, Plunkett attempts to put words to indescribable feelings of love and loss. When words don't cut it, her intricate electronic arrangements give heft to the intangible. The internal conflicts Half Waif makes public are raw, relatable, and often insoluble; these songs provide comfort without resolution.
Transience has always defined the Half Waif project; the name itself came to Plunkett when she finished college and moved to New York around the same time that her mother decided to sell her childhood home. She felt untethered and uncertain, a waif with a small landing pad in the form of family and friends. Over the past few years, Plunkett has found herself on the road more often than not; first as a member of Pinegrove and then, when her last EP form/a was released, Plunkett started committing to the Half Waif project full-time. She moved out of her home in Brooklyn and became another musician on the road, one who isn't beholden to any particular place. But Lavender suggests that home — or at least the idea of it — is always in Plunkett's line of vision.
“Back In Brooklyn” is a song about exactly that. It's the most sparse on the album, a piano ballad that Plunkett wrote after visiting Brooklyn on the tail-end of a tour. “I called you up when I got back/ Where have you been?/ Don't ask me that,” she recalls reuniting with old friends and having little vocabulary to explain away her absence. “Back In Brooklyn” is the most devastating song on Lavender, because it is the only one on which Plunkett sounds entirely alone. Lyrically, Plunkett is an optimist — her sad admissions are typically buoyed by some hint of hope. On “Torches,” she sings about reuniting with old friends who ask the same questions: “You used to say, ‘when are you coming back?'/ Then came the day when you no longer asked/ I fly through your life like an acrobat.” When she sings that word, “acrobat,” she's joined by cooing harmonies, the brutal drumbeat deflected so you can revel in that metaphor just for a moment.
You can hear Kate Bush in some of Plunkett's more dramatic production choices, but if you were to associate Half Waif with any contemporary artist, women like Lydia Ainsworth, ANOHNI, or Florence Welch might be a better frame of reference. Artists who push their sonics up and out of the atmosphere, who can turn small moments of emotional upset into towering, epic declarations. There's no real genre title that links any of them, but something like “mystical pop” feels about right. Especially on songs like “Solid 2 Void,” when Plunkett compares a collapsing relationship to an apocalypse. Or on lead single “Keep It Out,” when Plunkett vocalizes the building tension with a partner and the sparse, unfussy beat she sings over falls away for a moment when she reaches a climactic tipping point: “We seek to settle, we make a home/ It's fun for a little until it's old/ And so it withers, like all the rest/ ‘Til we're sleeping like strangers/ On opposite sides of the bed.”
The struggle to build a home with anyone you love is an omnipresent theme on Lavender, and the most instantly-memorable songs on the album deal in the complications of romantic relationships. “In The Evening” focuses on the small comforts of domesticity and the way caring for someone you share space with is instinctual, even when it isn't reciprocated. “In the morning there'll be tea and coffee/ And milk just the way you like,” Plunkett sings, her voice dipping in and out of focus. The electric stunner “Lilac House” approaches the same topic from a different angle, with Plunkett leaning into an epic fantasy where she is able to fully act on impulses that otherwise might be suppressed. “I've been looking on the bright side for my whole life/ Now I'm looking for trouble,” this unhinged version of Plunkett sings feverishly over a beat that strikes down like lightning during a flash flood.
There are a lot of staggering moments like that one on Lavender, songs that impress quickly simply because they are so forceful in their delivery. But one of the very best, and perhaps most unconventional on the album, appears on the backend. It's called “Leveler,” and there are moments on it when Plunkett's cadences recall an early-career Joni Mitchell. “I'll take the last train/ I'll make it in time/ I'll be holding your hand/ While you're leaving your mind,” Plunkett's voice slides upward effortlessly as she sings about saying a final goodbye to her grandmother, who died last year. It showcases Plunkett's lyricism at its finest, the way she can isolate one small moment in time and make it speak to a larger theme. Death is the ultimate leveler in that every time we're forced to confront it, we're flattened by the impossibility of truly understanding what it is to lose someone. And, relatedly, to lose a part of yourself in the process of saying goodbye.
The healing powers of lavender are numerous. Harvested before it blooms, it is best known for its unmistakable aroma and faint purpley-blue color. An herbalist told me that lavender can serve as a mild antidepressant, that it supports the nervous and digestive systems and its name comes from the word “lavar,” or “to wash.” When Plunkett first references the plant on lead track “Lavender Burning,” she describes it stewing over a stove in her now-deceased grandmother's house, “filling the space with a strange kind of loving.” In that moment, an otherwise downtrodden song about missing New York muscles up under a staggering drumbeat that builds momentum and lends at least a little confidence to Plunkett's admission that she's a lost woman. In allowing herself to explore that sense of loss, Plunkett constructed an album that captures a brief period of her evolution, both as an artist and a human being. Lavender, the plant, serves to soothe and bring comfort when you're in bad shape. Lavender, the album, does too.

America's far right usually shares a common goal: a quest for white power. But it is not a unified movement. It's filled with cliques and factions that have slightly different ideologies and inspirations, and which often signal their allegiances or send messages using flags, symbols, codes and Internet memes.
Most people are familiar with the swastika of Nazi Germany and the battle flag of America's Confederacy. But here are some of the other symbols that were seen when far-right groups descended on Charlottesville, Va., last weekend.
The tiki torch

The Ku Klux Klan had torches. The new far-right has tiki torches — which, like many other contemporary far-right symbols, is a somewhat ironic play on old imagery.
“We've really gotten into the tiki torch nationalism, we've embraced it, I love it,” Richard Spencer, a prominent white nationalist, said in a video. Spencer believes in a separate nation for white people, and he says the movement is “about our spirit and soul, I think these torchlight marches are fantastic to express that — it's very evocative and mystical.” A similar demonstration in Charlottesville in May also included tiki torches, “to keep the parasites at bay,” Spencer's site AltRight.com said.
After white nationalists with tiki torches marched through the University of Virginia campus on Friday night, the company behind the torches, TIKI Brand, said it was “deeply saddened and disappointed” by the display, adding, “We do not support their message or the use of our products in this way.”
The Southern nationalist flag (turned into a shield)

In Charlottesville, some far-right ralliers arrived with white shields adorned with a black X — the symbol of the League of the South, a far-right Southern nationalist group. The group's website says it “is not a ‘neo-Confederate' or ‘Southern heritage' organization,” but “a movement to promote the survival, well being, and independence of … Southerners of European descent who are committed to preserving the traditional culture of the South.”
A blogger by the name of Marcus Cicero wrote at Occidental Dissent that he was “one of the shield-men” and that “I was, still am, and will always be, honored to have been given the chance to stand and fight with men who proved that they represent the best part of the White Race in the struggle against beasts that fill their unholy prayers with calls for our destruction.”
A symbol of fascism: A bundle of rods, tied to an ax
The European-style fascist group Vanguard America gained notoriety in Charlottesville when James Alex Fields Jr. — the Ohio man accused of driving his car into a crowd of anti-racist protesters — was photographed carrying one of their shields. (Vanguard America denied that Fields was a member.)
On that shield: a logo of white axes with the handles wrapped in bundles. “Strength through unity is the universal motto for Fascists throughout history, which is why their traditional symbol is a Roman fasces; a bundle of rods binds to an axe,” Vanguard America's site says.
Vanguard America is fascist, adopting an old Nazi slogan, “blood and soil,” as its Internet URL and as its anti-globalist ethos. According to its manifesto, “A multicultural nation is no nation at all, but a collection of smaller ethnic nations ruled over by an overbearing tyrannical state. Our America is to be a nation exclusively for the White American peoples who out of the barren hills, empty plains, and vast mountains forged the most powerful nation to ever have existed.”
The ‘dragon's eye' triangle of Identity Evropa
It's not a cross, or an old Roman eagle -- just a triangle with three lines inside. It's the symbol of the Identity Evropa, which was founded by California-based white nationalist Nathan Damigo. The group describes itself on its website as “a generation of awakened Europeans who have discovered that we are part of the great peoples, history, and civilization that flowed from the European continent.”
The logo “is that of an ancient European design, the Dragon's Eye,” the group's site says. “The triangle represents the threat that we as a people are facing. The ‘y' inside represents the choice that we have to make between good and evil. It is a symbol of protection that will grant us succor against the ongoing evil that seeks to destroy truth.”
One of the white nationalists who was photographed wearing a shirt with Identity Evropa's “dragon's eye” logo, Peter Cvjetanovic, 20, of Nevada, was heavily criticized after the Friday march on the University of Virginia campus. “I understand the photo has a very negative connotation. But I hope that the people sharing the photo are willing to listen that I'm not the angry racist they see in that photo,” Cvjetanovic told a Nevada TV station.
However, he added, “We all deserve a future for our children and for our culture.”

Tradeshift, a supply chain payments and marketplaces late-stage startup which recently added blockchain to its armory, has today raised $250 million in a Series E funding round led by Goldman Sachs and Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP Investments). Additional participation comes from HSBC, H14, GP Bullhound and Gray Swan, a new venture company established by Tradeshift's founders. The new round of financing brings Tradeshift's total funding to more than $400 million. The company claims it's valuation has now passed $1.1 billion.
The new investors join existing backers, including HSBC, American Express Ventures, the CreditEase Fintech Investment Fund, Notion Capital, Santander InnoVentures and others. Mikkel Hippe Brun, Tradeshift's GM of China and co-founder, will join Tradeshift's board of directors.
Tradeshift CEO and co-founder Christian Lanng said in a statement: “We have always believed that the future of supply chains is 100 percent digital and that connecting trade is just the first step to a digitally connected economy. This investment will enable us to continue our rapid growth and consolidate our leadership position.”
“Given the rapid increase in B2B online transactions, online marketplaces are no longer just for consumers. Tradeshift has established itself as a leader in supply chain commerce by enabling corporations around the globe to take greater control of their supply chains,” said Darren Cohen, global head of Principal Strategic Investments at Goldman Sachs.
The Iowa Department of Public Health was happy to find the state in the minority following a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on the number of deaths from strokes nationwide.
DPH Health Systems Coordinator Terry Meek says the numbers in most states increased or held steady in the report — but not here. “Iowa is one of 13 states where we have actually continue decreasing the number of deaths due to stroke,” Meek explains. “Our rate has decreased 33 percent between 2005 and 2015.” Meek says the biggest factor in the Iowa's ability to lower stroke deaths is linked to money it received from the CDC.
“That funding was called the Coverdale Stroke Program. And what it did was give us some money where we were able to call together a lot of partners and really work on some targeted activities to decrease stroke deaths,” according to Meek. That targeted program included education that highlighted the signs and symptoms of a stroke, and encouraged people to immediately call 911 at the first signs of stroke.
“The reason for doing that is important because there is medication that usually can be given if people get there (the hospital) soon enough that will preclude some of the major problems with stroke,” she says. They also strengthened the stroke identification and care at the Comprehensive Stroke and Primary Stroke Centers in Iowa, along with changing the EMS protocols to include immediate transfer of stroke patients to the closest and highest level of stroke center.
“So more people were getting to those compressive and primary stroke centers in Iowa quicker,” Meek says. The quicker treatment and transports led to fewer deaths. Meek says the state also developed the Iowa Stroke Registry with the University of Iowa to help track what is going on. She says you can help continue to improve its stroke death rate in Iowa by taking steps to prevent strokes.
“Eating a healthy diet, watching their blood pressure, making sure that they have regular checkups with their physician, where the physician can check for cholesterol, high blood pressure and other things that may be a problem — including diabetes,” Meek says.
Meek says you can recognize the signs of stroke by remembering “F.A.S.T.”
Here's what it means:
Face — Ask the person to smile. Does one side droop?
Arms –Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downwards?
Speech – Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence. Are the words slurred?
Time — If the person shows any of these symptoms, call 911 immediately.

More than two decades after his first victory at Saujana Golf & Country Club, Lee Westwood stormed into contention for his second with a brilliant 62 in the Maybank Championship.
Westwood, who struggled to an opening 72, fired 11 birdies and a solitary bogey to reach halfway at 10 under par, a shot behind joint leaders Nino Bertasio and Phachara Khongwatmai.
The former world No. 1 won the Malaysian Open at Saujana in 1997 but has not tasted victory since 2015 and is currently not exempt for the Masters, an event where he finished second in 2010 and 2016.
Editor's Picks The Masters lingers in his mind, but does Tiger Woods have time? Woods says it's too early to be thinking about Augusta, but he is also dropping hints about the year's first major -- one that he won four times between 1997 and 2005. There's a lot of work to do between now and April.
Haas opens with 64 to take Phoenix Open lead Bill Haas played a five-hole stretch in 5 under, capped by a birdie on 16, and finished at 7-under 64 on Thursday to take a two-stroke lead at the Phoenix Open. 1 Related
"It was enjoyable, there were a lot of birdies going in out there," the 44-year-old said. "It's nice to be in contention and to know this golf course well. I was touring pro for this course, so I've probably played it more than most and I know where to hit it.
"I hit it close a lot and it was a pretty pain-free round. Gave myself a lot of birdie chances, so it was a really good ball-striking round and I holed out well as well. I was pleased with the way today went and hopefully we can build on that more.
"I played alright the first three weeks of the year. I missed the first two cuts but I sort of got in my own way mentally, not sure the reason for that but today I just freewheeled really and had fun out there."
Bertasio and 18-year-old Thai prospect Khongwatmai both shot 65 to set the pace on 11 under, with Westwood joined on 10 under by first-round leader Chris Paisley, Yuta Ikeda and Scotland's Marc Warren.
Warren was among the players forced to finish their first rounds on Friday after Thursday's weather delay and completed a 68 before adding a second round of 66.
"I'm really pleased overall," Warren said. "On this golf course if you only have one bogey [in two days] your game is going to be pretty solid and I feel every aspect is pretty good, so looking forward to the weekend."
The halfway cut fell at four under par and means the remaining 81-strong field is separated by just seven shots, with 50 players within five of the lead.
Craig Harrison has struck again in the transfer market by signing former Newcastle United youngster Ryan Donaldson.
That makes it five new signings from the Hartlepool United boss after snapping up the midfielder following his release by Plymouth Argyle at the end of their promotion-winning season.
Donaldson made 33 appearances for the Pilgrims, scoring twice, only to fall out of favour for the final two months of the campaign.
The Geordie, who is still only 26, played for Pools as a teenager back in 2011 in League One, making 12 appearances on loan from Newcastle.
He never made it at his boyhood club, only making a couple of first-team appearances, but revived his career across the Tyne at Gateshead in the National League.
It earned him a move to their rivals Cambridge United and he helped the U's clinch promotion, ironically against his former club in the play-off final at Wembley, where his goal sealed victory.
That victory was his second dose of Wembley glory, having earlier scored two of the goals when they won the FA Trophy 4-0 against Gosport Borough.
Donaldson spent a further two seasons in the Football League with Cambridge before joining League Two rivals Plymouth last summer.
His capture continues in the same pattern of the other Harrison acquisitions.
All five of the Harrison quintet have experience in the National League. Keeper Scott Loach spent a loan stint at York last season, midfielder Luke George skippered both Southport and Chester in the division, attacker Jack Munns won the NL Title with Cheltenham and forward Jake Cassidy scored eight goals for Guiseley.
Pallekele [Sri Lanka], Aug 14 (ANI): Indian all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin, who has been rested for the upcoming limited-overs series against Sri Lanka, is confirmed to make his county cricket debut for Worcestershire this season.
Earlier, it was reported that Worcestershire had expressed their desire to avail Ashwin's services towards the end of their season.
However, the Indian off-spinner is expected to be available as early as his county side's clash against Gloucestershire starting August 28.
Besides Ashwin, Indian fast bowler Ishant Sharma and Cheteshwar Pujara will also feature on the English circuit this season, ESPNcricinfo reported.
While Ishant will play for Warwickshire, Pujara will continue to represent Nottinghamshire for whom he has been playing since the start of the season.
Ashwin and his team-mate Pujara can also face each other when Worcestershire lock horns table-toppers Nottinghamshire beginning September 5.
Meanwhile, left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja has also been in talks to play county cricket, but which team he will play for is yet to be decided.

A chilling video shows a "resentful" husband dragging a suitcase with his ex-wife's body in through the streets after he had strangled her to death with her own scarf.
Ashwin Daudia, 51, killed mum-of-two Kiran Daudia, 46, after becoming angry she was making him homeless and had started seeing other men.
The shocking CCTV footage shows him wearing a hooded top as he pulled her corpse along a road inside the luggage before hiding it near a neighbour's house.
The couple, who had been together for 26 years, had divorced three years earlier and had sold their property to Mrs Daudia's sister, Preti Jethwa.
Kiran, who worked for retail giant Next, was reported missing on January 16 last year - the same day that the sale was due to go through.

A court heard how Daudia had probably strangled his former partner with her scarf before showing "remarkable coolness" by cleaning up the murder scene.
The factory machine operator stuffed the corpse into a suitcase, after initially picking one which was too small, and crammed her belongings into another before their 17-year-old son got home from college.
He then dragged the suitcase through the streets away from their home address, the CCTV video shows.
Her body was discovered by a neighbour "trussed up" in the suitcase near their terraced home in Evington, Leicester, at 9.30am on January 17 last year.
Today Daudia showed no emotion as he was convicted of murder and jailed for life to serve a minimum of 18 years at Leicester Crown Court .

Her family have described the mum as "the backbone of the family, very kind, generous and angelic".
The trial heard the couple were paired together in an arranged marriage in India in 1988 and continued to live under the same roof after they divorced in 2014.
On the day she went missing, security cameras captured Kiran turning into her street at around 2.20pm after finishing her shift working as customer services advisor.
Prosecutor William Harbage QC said: "Within the next hour she was dead. The defendant was the only other person in the house.
"There was an argument between Ashwin and Kiran, there was a struggle in which he strangled her with some sort of ligature, probably her own scarf.
"Had this been some sort of domestic incident which had got out of hand and the defendant immediately regretted what had happened, one might have expected him to have raised the alarm and called for an ambulance or the police.
"He did nothing of the sort, instead showing a remarkable coolness in the circumstances, he tried to cover up what he had done."

Giving evidence, the dad-of-two claimed that he had "lost control" after his estranged wife had kicked him in the "urine area" and repeatedly swore at him.
Speaking through a Gujarati interpreter he claimed he banged her head on a bannister, before pressing on her neck with both hands.
He told the court: "Her scarf had come off from her neck, then I twisted the scarf on here [pointing at a photo of the banister], in the corner where the pole is.
"With my knee I pushed her down and I kept holding her very tightly and the scarf was wrapped around as well.
"With my knee I pushed her so she went down a little. She fell half down, so she was like hung."

He claimed that he had to use his own suitcase to hide the body, as hers was a "little bit too small".
He also said he removed her boots and tied her wrists and ankles together to stop them coming out and being seen.
Detective Sergeant Mark Wesley, who was part of the investigation team, said: “The evidence against Daudia was overwhelming, with CCTV work and forensic examinations helping us to build a strong case against him.
“He was solely responsible for the death of his ex-wife. Kiran had her family at the heart of everything she did.
“Through his own selfish, cowardly actions Daudia has ripped this family apart, leaving two doting sons without a mother and other family members distraught and struggling to get over the pain and heartache he has caused.”
Kiran's family released a statement which said: “Kiran was full of life, with a vibrant personality, a loving, caring mother and a very thoughtful daughter, sister and aunt.
"Her friendly and charismatic nature meant she had many friends.
"She was simply beautiful and loved having photographs taken. She was the backbone of the family, very kind, generous and angelic.
“We as a family cannot even begin to describe the loss and emptiness in our heart.
"Her perpetual smile will be missed everyday of our lives by everyone who knew her. Kiran had lots of dreams and aspirations which were untimely taken away by this demonic act.
"Life without her will never be the same."
Janine Smith, from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), added: "There was overwhelming evidence that Ashwin Daudia was not only responsible for Ms Daudia's death, but that he had intended to kill her.
"During the trial the CPS presented evidence to the jury that the injuries Ms Daudia suffered and the defendant's actions after her death were those of someone with intent to kill or do serious harm and were a calculated attempted to cover up his actions.
"My heartfelt sympathies are with Ms Daudia's family, especially her two sons, who have had to come to terms with so much.
"I hope that the conclusion of these proceedings will provide some closure for them."

Cybersecurity is out of control. Literally.
Over 3 billion people use the Internet, and we are led to believe that cybersecurity is everyone's responsibility. To put it bluntly, that doesn't work, and it never will. As the saying goes, when everyone is responsible, nobody is. It's time for a change.
Recently, I had the great privilege of serving as a member of a non-partisan commission appointed by President Obama. Our task was to put together specific recommendations for the next Administration to strengthen cybersecurity in the public and private sectors. We issued our Report on Securing and Growing the Digital Economy last month, which includes 53 recommended actions. Here are a few of the report's significant, overarching principles:
Drain the Cyber Swamp
It is not possible or optimal for every person and every company to be on the frontlines of cybersecurity. We should focus on fewer, higher level solutions that benefit everybody. Shifting the burden away from end users will require a sustained international effort to tackle common Internet ecosystem threats, such as eliminating botnets that infect millions of victims and can take down power grids. Products, protocols and systems should be secure by design and by default, their complexity reduced, and their security capabilities disclosed. Finally, we need to ratchet up threat deterrence. The bad guys, whether criminal or military, won't relent unless we improve our abilities to detect, identify and penalize them using all elements of national power.
Measure by Effectiveness, Not by the Undertaking
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a simply stated document, but don't let that fool you. Attempting to achieve the Framework's list of 98 specific outcomes would be enormously difficult and costly. And to what end? Unfortunately, nobody seems to know, not even the regulators that are so quick to determine whether a breached company's actions were “unreasonable.” We quickly must address our lack of fact-based metrics that would establish not only whether the NIST Framework and related standards are cost-effective, but whether and to what extent they are effective at all. Regulators also should get their acts together by harmonizing their rules around common principles, as well as with one another.
Find New Ways to Win
The government and the private sector must resolve how to work together to jointly defend the nation in cyberspace. We also must continue to innovate with substantial advances in automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning and identity management. Finally, we must promote international standards that foster security, privacy and interoperability in ways that make it easier for businesses to innovate and operate with certainty across geopolitical boundaries.
Play Ball!
The commission's report is like a pitch straight down the middle. It's packed with energy, urgency and direction. The new Administration, working internationally and with industry, can knock it out of the park. We have to. We're currently down in cybersecurity, and it feels like the bottom of the ninth.
Be skeptical of ads declaring you can rev up your brain's performance by challenging it with products from the growing brain-training industry.
Science does not support many of the claims.
That's according to a new study published in the science journal Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience from a team of Florida State University researchers.
Neil Charness, professor of psychology and a leading authority on aging and cognition, teamed up with Wally Boot, associate professor of psychology, and graduate student Dustin Souders to test the theory that brain games help preserve cognitive function.
“Our findings and previous studies confirm there's very little evidence these types of games can improve your life in a meaningful way,” said Boot, an expert on age-related cognitive decline.
Charness, who's also the director of FSU's Institute for Successful Longevity, said an increasing number of people believe brain training helps protect them against memory loss or cognitive disorders.
“Brain challenges like crossword games are a popular approach, especially among baby boomers, as a way to try to protect cognition,” Charness said.
That popularity has turned the brain-training industry into a billion-dollar business. Brain games are available online and through mobile apps that typically sell for about $15 a month or $300 for lifetime memberships. But advertising for this rapidly growing business sector has sometimes used inflated claims. The Federal Trade Commission fined one brain-training company $50 million for false advertising, which was later lowered to $2 million.
“More companies are beginning to be fined for these types of inflated claims and that's a good thing,” Boot said. “These exaggerated claims are not consistent with the conclusions of our latest study.”
The FSU team's study focused on whether brain games could boost the “working memory” needed for a variety of tasks. In their study, they set up one group of people to play a specially designed brain-training video game called “Mind Frontiers,” while another group of players performed crossword games or number puzzles.
All players were given lots of information they needed to juggle to solve problems. Researchers tested whether the games enhanced players' working memory and consequently improved other mental abilities, such as reasoning, memory and processing speed.
That's the theory behind many brain games: If you improve overall working memory, which is fundamental to so much of what we do every day, then you can enhance performance in many areas of your life.
The team examined whether improving working memory would translate to better performance on other tasks or as the researchers called it: “far transfer.”
In short, no.
“It's possible to train people to become very good at tasks that you would normally consider general working memory tasks: memorizing 70, 80, even 100 digits,” Charness said. “But these skills tend to be very specific and not show a lot of transfer. The thing that seniors in particular should be concerned about is, if I can get very good at crossword puzzles, is that going to help me remember where my keys are? And the answer is probably no.”
Charness has spent much of his career the past 45 years trying to wrap his brain around the way the mind functions and how it ages. With the senior population continuing to grow — 45 million Americans are 65 or older — Charness understands their concerns about preserving brain function and remaining independent.
“People have real concerns about loss of cognition and loss of memory as they age, so they do all kinds of things to try to stave off cognitive decline,” Charness said.
Charness noted that other research finds aerobic exercise, rather than mental exercise, is great for your brain. Physical exercise can actually cause beneficial structural changes in the brain and boost its function. He predicts “exer-gaming,” which combines exercise with brain games, will increase in popularity in the 21st century.
“I wouldn't come away from our article totally discouraged,” Charness said. “It's another piece of the puzzle that we're all trying to assemble. It's discouraging in the sense that we can't find far transfer and that seems to be a fairly consistent finding in research. But if your real goal is to improve cognitive function and brain games are not helping, then maybe you are better off getting aerobic exercise rather than sitting in front of the computer playing these games.”

SUZUKA, Japan -- Fernando Alonso will receive a 35-place grid penalty at the Japanese Grand Prix after McLaren-Honda was forced to change his car's power unit overnight.
The hydraulic issue was discovered after second practice as the team rebuilt the car and is the latest in a long list of reliability problems for Honda this year. The overnight change meant McLaren broke the mechanics' curfew for the second time this year, leaving it with no more curfew exemptions for the rest of the season.

The change means Alonso has now used eight internal combustion engines, eight MGU-Ks, 10 MGU-Hs, 10 turbochargers, seven hybrid batteries and six control electronics this season. Under the regulations each driver is limited to four per season without penalty, meaning Alonso's car is more than double its quota for some components this year.
The newly-fitted power unit is Honda's spec 3.7 engine, which first ran on Stoffel Vandoorne's car at the Belgian Grand Prix and is the same spec that was previously in Alonso's car.
Combined with a lack of performance, Honda's reliability issues is one of the main reasons McLaren will split with the Japanese manufacturer at the end of this year. McLaren is due to use Renault engines in 2018 and Honda will supply Toro Rosso.
Alonso was 12th fastest in first practice at Suzuka, which was the only dry session on Friday.

The Chicago Bears made the move to Mitchell Trubisky ahead of Monday night's tilt with the Minnesota Vikings out of necessity after Mike Glennon turned the ball over at a ridiculous rate.
After insisting all summer that Trubisky needed time to learn from the sideline, the Bears are flipping the script, preaching the rookie's preparedness.
On Thursday, offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains said Trubisky is "as close to ready as any rookie I've ever been around," via the Chicago Tribune.
Let's hope Trubisky is more ready than other rookies, for the sake of Bears fans. The last two high profile rookies Loggains has been around: Jake Locker in 2011 (made zero starts) and Johnny Manziel in 2014 (made two starts).
We can forgive the outlandish idea that after watching the TURNOVER BOT 2000 play quarterback for a measly four games, Trubisky is magically ready for game action when that the rookie probably should have started from the opener. The least John Fox admitted the mistake and made a move that was somewhat out of character for the conservative coach.
Loggains noted that Trubisky's athleticism will aid the offense, buying time for his receivers to come open. Where Glennon was a sitting duck, Trubisky allows Loggains to open the playbook, incorporating zone-read looks and rollouts.
Still, the offensive coordinator cautioned that there will be struggles.
"Mitch Trubisky is a very good, young player, but he is not a magic wand," Loggains said. "We need to play better around him. That starts with me and goes to every position group. We've got to eliminate drops. We need to eliminate the negative runs and the negative plays because it's really hard to play quarterback when it's second-and-15, and it's a known passing situation."
In the grand scheme of things, after a 1-3 start Bears fans are searching for hope for a brighter future. That hope now rests in Trubisky.
Mitch-A-Palooza starts Monday night. Grab your party hat.

Hyundai Vision G (HCD-16) concept Enlarge Photo
One of the six cars Genesis plans to have in its lineup by the end of 2020 is a large, luxurious coupe built more for grand touring than carving up race tracks.
Unfortunately, a previous plan to fit the car with a V-8 looks to have been axed with Genesis instead favoring an electrified powertrain. The information was confirmed to Drive by Genesis design boss Luc Donckerwolke.
“As much as I like to drive V-8s, I believe electrification is going to be a main element,” the former Bentley and Lamborghini design told the Australian publication when quizzed about a V-8 being fitted to the new coupe.
He pointed to the regulatory environment as one of the key reasons for going the electrification route.
Hyundai Vision G (HCD-16) concept Enlarge Photo
“See what's happening; diesels are being banned from the cities.” He said. “Emissions have to be reduced drastically. Today a V-8 is not exactly responding to that environment.”
Separately, Manfred Fitzgerald, the boss of Genesis, told Drive that as more cars become electrified, you're going to see performance equalize among brands and thus become less of a differentiator. He gave the example of when most cars can do 0-60 mph in less than 3.0 seconds, customers will seek other attributes such as brand recognition or the design or the level of connectivity.
The Vision G concept car from 2015 hints at what Genesis has in store for its new coupe.
There are still a few years until the car arrives, however. If a leaked product roadmap is to be believed, the coupe will be the last of Genesis' six planned cars. We've already seen the G90 and G80 sedans launched. Later this year we'll see a G70 sedan join the range and after that we'll see a mid-size SUV based on the recently-revealed GV80 concept, as well as a small SUV likely badged a GV70.

There is nothing to be gained from blind optimism. But an optimistic mindset can be grounded in rationality and evidence. It may be hard to believe, but we are living in the most exciting time in human history. Despite all of our ongoing global challenges, humanity has never been better off. Not only are we living healthier, happier, and safer lives than ever before, but new technological tools are also opening up a universe of opportunities.
In order to continue to launch moonshot ideas, tackle global challenges, and push humanity forward, it's important to be intelligently optimistic about the future.
Our Pessimism Bias
When we think about the future of our species, many of us are inherently pessimistic. Our brains are wired to pay more attention to the threats in our personal lives and our world at large.
Many studies have shown we react more strongly to negative stimuli than positive stimuli, and that we dedicate more of our brain resources to negative information. Some psychologists have also shown that we tend to give greater weight to negative thoughts when making decisions and that we tend to remember negative events in our lives more than positives.
There is an evolutionary advantage to these tendencies. We often forget that our neural hardware has been developed to survive the African savannah, where survival depended on being aware of constant sources of danger. But it may no longer serve its purpose in our modern world.
The media is partially to blame for adding fuel to the fire. In fact, studies show that bad news outweighs good news by as much as seventeen negative news reports for every one good one. News agencies know very well that we will pay more attention to bad news and hence, “If it bleeds, it leads.”
Another team of psychologists from McGill revealed that people tend to choose to read articles with negative tones and respond much faster to headlines with negative words. You're not constantly seeing negative headlines because the world is getting worse, you're constantly seeing negative headlines because that's what audiences react to.
Studies have shown that the public tends to pay most attention to news about war and terrorism and least about science and technology. Consequently, we have trained journalists and news channels to focus on those issues more than on our innovative breakthroughs. What does that say about us as a society?
A Need for Intelligent Optimism
Intelligent optimism is all about being excited about the future in an informed and rational way. The mindset is critical if we are to get everyone excited about the future by highlighting the rapid progress we have made and recognizing the tremendous potential humans have to find solutions to our problems.
Despite ongoing challenges, we have a lot to celebrate about how far we've come as a species. As optimists like Peter Diamandis point out, we are living in an era of abundance, and there's a lot of evidence to prove it.
Let's be very clear: being intelligently optimistic does not mean we turn our backs to the many global challenges we are faced with today. Our world is far from perfect. The refugee crisis, climate change, wealth inequality, and other global issues are significant and worthy of our attention.
But as physicist and futurist David Deutsch points out, “Problems exist; and problems are soluble with the right knowledge.” Intelligent optimism involves recognizing the many problems we are faced with and acknowledging that we can solve them just as we have overcome many other challenges in the past.
A Critical Mindset for Progress
We can't let negative headlines and the media shape our perception of ourselves as a species, and the vision we have for the future. As legendary astronomer Carl Sagan said, “For all of our failings, despite our limitations and fallibility, we humans are capable of greatness.”
Hollywood likes to paint disproportionately dystopian visions of the world, and while those are possible futures, we can and must also imagine a future of humanity where we live in abundance, prosperity, and transcendence. We can't expect current innovators and future generations to make this positive vision a reality if they believe our species is doomed for failure. It inspires us to continue to contribute to human progress and feel that we can push humanity forward.
It's absolutely critical that our journalists cover the many challenges, threats, and issues in our world today. But just as we report the significant negative news in the world, we must also continue to highlight humanity's accomplishments. After all, how can our youth grow up believing they can have a positive impact on the world if the news is suggesting otherwise?

Smart will no longer offer gasoline-powered cars in the U.S. after the 2017 model year, Mercedes-Benz has confirmed. The pint-sized cars will only be available in EV form.
The company didn't issue a formal press announcement, but dealers were informed of the decision on Monday, Mercedes-Benz told Motor Trend. In a letter to dealers, Mercedes said, “Developments within the micro-car segment present some challenges for the current smart product portfolio. Therefore, with the launch of the fourth-generation smart fortwo electric drive this summer, the smart lineup will consist exclusively of the zero emissions smart electric drive coupe and cabrio in the U.S. and Canada.”
Smart began selling the Fortwo in the U.S. for the 2008 model year before introducing an electric model for 2011. The company is a low-volume player in the U.S. where it sold just 6,211 vehicles last year.
Despite its small size, the gas-powered Fortwo doesn't impress in fuel economy. It tops out at a respectable 33/39/35 city/highway/combined, but cars such as the Honda Civic can do better while offering more space.
Mercedes seems confident that the decision fits the company's goals for the future. “Electric is central to our long-term powertrain strategy in the U.S., and the smart fortwo electric drive will play an important role in carrying this forward,” the letter said.
After this year, Smart drivers will still be able to service their gas-powered Fortwos at authorized dealers. Smart currently has 85 dealers in the U.S., and Mercedes admits it's unclear if that number will decrease now that the gas cars have been cut from the lineup, Automotive News reports.

A Massachusetts museum dedicated to Dr. Seuss says it will replace a mural featuring a Chinese character from one of his books after three authors said they would boycott an event due to the "jarring racial stereotype."
The mural features illustrations from the author's first children's book, "And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street."
The Amazing World of Dr. Seuss, located in the author's hometown of Springfield, said Thursday that the mural would be replaced by images from later books.
Three children's authors declined an invitation to the museum's inaugural Children's Literature Festival, which was set for Oct. 14 before being canceled. After the museum offered to take down the mural, the authors said they would attend, but the museum has not said if the festival is back on.

The London Salvation Army is hoping for a Christmas miracle.
With just days to go before the organization's annual Christmas hamper distribution program ramps up, many of the tables at the Western Fair District's Progress Building were sitting empty on Monday.
“We're pretty set for food, it's toys where we're struggling,” said Shannon Wise, spokesperson for the Salvation Army's Ontario Great Lakes Division.
“There's going to be almost 7,000 children who need our help this Christmas season, and some of these tables have nothing on them. So we really need that extra Christmas miracle, so to speak.”

In particular, Wise said they're in need of toys for children between the ages of eight and 12. “That age group, for some reason, gets overlooked at this time of year,” she said.
“Things like board games, art and jewelry kits, Lego, even things like bath sets, hair dryers and hats and mitts, specifically, is what we need for ages eight to 12 this Christmas.”
Those looking to donate toys can do so by taking them to the Progress Building at the Western Fair District between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.
“They are directly and immediately going into hamper bags for kids because we're that short,” Wise said. “We have volunteers [who] don't have any toys to pack.”

Toy donations can also be made at any London Fire Department station, and at Masonville, Westmount and White Oaks malls.
Hamper registration and distribution begins on Wednesday and runs until Dec. 19.
The Salvation Army kicked off the 127th edition of its annual Christmas Kettle Campaign last month with a target goal of $550,000.
During last year's campaign, the organization says more than 5,400 households received a food hamper and more than 6,000 children received a bag of toys.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - U.S. engineering and construction company McDermott International plans to bid for $5 billion in contracts in the next few months in Asia Pacific as the region's offshore oil and gas sector recovers, company executives said on Tuesday.
The value of contracts available for bids are up from $4 billion six months ago, the McDermott executives said.
“We have seen a 15-20 percent increase in the number of projects that we can bid in the region,” Mahesh Swaminathan, senior commercial director of McDermott Asia Pacific, told reporters on the sidelines of the OTC Asia conference.
“This is why we say that there are already some green shoots and we hope that they continue to grow,” he said, referring to a recovery in the offshore exploration and development sector.
Global oil prices that have held steadily above $60 a barrel and sharp cost cuts in the upstream sector are encouraging companies to pump money into exploration and production, although many producers remain wary that the U.S. shale oil and gas boom could keep prices lower for longer.
McDermott plans to place 20 bids for projects in Malaysia, India, Australia, Vietnam, Indonesia and Myanmar, the executives said, without specifying which projects.
McDermott also hopes to close a deal to merge with Chicago Bridge & Iron Co (CB&I) in May, said Ian Prescott, vice president of Asia at McDermott.
The merger will add to the two companies' capabilities and resources in the region, he said.
These include CB&I's engineering office in New Delhi that employees 600-800 people, its business in Australia, fabrication of storage tanks for liquefied natural gas, oil and natural gas, and its refining and petrochemical technology, Prescott said.

The dozen owners of Lamborghini Venenos -- an ultra-rare supercar that cost $4 million and up -- will be receiving some bad news via registered mail: their Italian dream machines are being recalled.
The 12-cylinder, 750-horsepower models that Automobili Lamborghini SpA billed as a “street-legal racing car” are among about 5,900 Aventadors the carmaker will recall worldwide over risks that a fuel system fault could lead to fires, the company said Tuesday.
It alleges that last week's special, “The Last Days of Michael Jackson,” illegally uses significant excerpts of his most valuable songs, including “Billie Jean” and “Bad,” and music videos, including “Thriller” and “Black or White.” It says the special also used clips from a documentary and feature film belonging to the estate.
The Encino estate where Motown legend Smokey Robinson once lived has sold for $8.253 million, or about $778 per square foot.
Robinson bought the 1912 Southern Colonial in 1988 and owned it for more than a decade before selling it in 2002 for about $2.3 million. The property sold again in 2016 for $3.15 million and, following a renovation and expansion, was introduced to the market this summer for $8.75 million.
Set on more than an acre of grounds, the walled and gated two-story is approached by a circular driveway that surrounds a boxwood topiary with a fountain feature.
The 10,600-square-foot house features a foyer lined with checkerboard marble that opens on either side to living and sitting rooms. The open-plan kitchen has a marble-topped island/bar. Grey-hued built-ins line the walls in the home theater. There are seven bedrooms, eight full bathrooms and two powder rooms.

Craig Knizek, Billy Rose and Andrea Korchek of the Agency were the listing agents. Mauricio Umansky, also with the Agency, represented the buyer.
Robinson, 77, gained fame in the 1960s as a co-founder of the group the Miracles. As a solo artist later in his career, he scored such songs as "A Quiet Storm" and "Cruisin'." His songwriting credits include such hits as "My Girl" and "The Way You Do the Things You Do."
He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987.

Luke McCullough is hoping to put an 18-month injury nightmare behind him today when he turns out for Doncaster Rovers at Portsmouth.
For apart from a seven-game run at the back end of last season, the 23-year has been plagued by a knee problem, including a cruciate ligament injury.
The Irishman has yet to feature for Darren Ferguson's side this season, since helping to clinch promotion from League Two last year.
Now the defender/midfielder could feature against Pompey, having played 90 minutes in a behind-closed-doors friendly against Lincoln City last weekend.
He said: “It's nice to be back training with the lads, it's been tough for me but sometimes it doesn't feel that long since I was playing at the end of last season.
“Psychologically this injury was tough because I kept getting setbacks, with my knee injury I knew straight away it was going to be a long one so I learned to deal with that better.
I've spoken to the psychologist at the club a few times and the rest of the staff have been really good with me, you have to be strong for yourself and those around you. Luke McCullough
“I've spoken to the psychologist at the club a few times and the rest of the staff have been really good with me, you have to be strong for yourself and those around you.
“I've been coming to every home game and the odd away one too, I like to come and support the lads whichever way I can. You feel out of the loop when you're not playing but I try to stay involved.
“I haven't been myself with my family while I've been injured because I'm not doing my job, when you're injured it's tough to switch off from it.
“I'll need to play a handful of games before I feel match fit again, I've played in a few development games which have improved my fitness to where it needs to be.”
Rovers head to Fratton Park without a win in their last six outings.
Four of those have ended in draws, leaving Doncaster in mid-table, five points behind ninth-placed Pompey.
With this week's arrival of loan duo Tom Anderson (Burnley) and Andy Boyle (Preston), Rovers have sent out defenders Danny Amos, Reece Fielding and Tyler Walker on loan to non-League clubs.
Fielding and Walker have returned to Biggleswade Town for the remainder of the season.
Amos has joined Evo-Stik Premier Division side Buxton on a month's loan.

Iran Focus
London, 17 Apr - On Saturday, a radical cleric in Iraq called for the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad to step down and called on the US, Iran and Russia to stop intervening in the Civil War.
Moqtada al-Sadr, who is based in Najaf condemned the murders of 87 people (including 31 children) in a chemical attack, on an area controlled by the resistance forces, that is widely blamed on the Syrian Government.
In a statement, he said: “I would consider it fair for President Bashar al-Assad to resign and leave power, allowing the dear people of Syria to avoid the scourge of war and terrorist oppression.”
Following the attack, the US fired 59 cruise missiles at Shayrat airbase in Syria; as that was believed to be the origin point for the chemical attack.
Sadr, who fronted a militia that fought the US occupation of Iraq, criticised that move and asked that all foreign powers stop interfering in the Civil War.
He said: “I call on all sides to withdraw their military assets from Syria so that the Syrian people take things into their own hands. They are the only ones with the right to decide their fate — the alternative will turn Syria to rubble.”
However, there are several Iraqi Shia militias, some directly supported by Iran, who are currently helping Assad by sending military units into Syria.
Track Persia defended any forces controlled by Sadr, remarking that his forces were protecting holy sites in the region; which is the same reasoning that Iran uses, despite the bodies of Iranian forces being found hundreds of miles from said shrines.
The official response from the Iraqi Government, which is largely influenced by Assad's ally Iran, drew a fine line between its alliances with the US and Iran.
It condemned the attack without naming Assad as the perpetrator and called for an international investigation into the attack, in order to punish those responsible. However, it also criticised “hasty interventions” that followed without mentioning the US strikes.
In 2005-06, Sadr's self-styled Mahdi army was involved in the sectarian killings which overran Baghdad. During this time, hundreds of Sunnis were murdered by militias loyal to various Shia leaders and hundreds of Shias were murdered in retaliation.
In March 2017, Sadr told Middle East Eye that sectarian militias have no place in Iraq, noting that creating a dialogue between the Sunnis and the Shias was the better option.
He said: “I'm afraid that the defeat of Daesh [Islamic State] is only the start of a new phase. My proposal is inspired by fear of sectarian and ethnic conflict after Mosul's liberation. I want to avoid this. I am very proud of Iraq's diversity but my fear is that we may see a genocide of some ethnic or sectarian groups.”
Digit, the developer of a wildly popular automatic savings mobile app, is moving beyond its core business with a new feature enabling users to pay down credit card debt from their Digit account.
Announced earlier today the new Digit Pay service, which uses savings in a Digit account to pay off credit card debt for any registered account.
The new feature works by enabling users to create a “credit card debt” goal in their Digit settings and activate the Digit Pay service. Digit automatically will begin to save money from a linked checking account — and use those funds to pay off credit cards. Credit card payments can even be prioritized through Digit's boost feature.
So far, the Digit app has been used to save roughly $1 billion for its customers according to chief executive officer Ethan Bloch .
Bloch says that Digit has been focused on solving the biggest financial pain points for the most customers it can reach in the U.S. For the company, that meant starting with savings…. and moving on to the next biggest threat to customers' financial health in the U.S. — debt.
Roughly 75% of the company's customers have credit card debt (hi, my name is Jon and I'm a Digit customer).
In the U.S. there's about $1 trillion of credit card debt outstanding — a stat that's very no bueno for the U.S. economy. Add to that, an average U.S. household owes about $16,883 and pays about $1,292 in interest each year (credit card companies thank you).
For folks who need a refresher in how Digit works, the company's app provides a service that connects to checking accounts from almost any bank . Digit's software analyzes income and spending and then sets aside small amounts of money at intervals that won't impact an account. The company offers a 1% annualized savings bonus for people who save with Digit for three months, and the service costs $2.99 per month after a free 100 day trial period.
Those savings are placed in a rainy day fund or toward any other financial goals that a user sets in the app. They can be customized, and the latest customization is this Digit Pay option.
It's the first time that Digit is linking back out to other vendors and it paves the way for other services using the Digit balance.
One thing that users shouldn't expect to see anytime soon is an investment feature in Digit, according to Bloch. “Digit was founded to make financial health effortless,” Bloch said. While investment tools are good for helping their users make more money, Bloch said they weren't core to his view of financial health.
“We'll be focused on those two… savings and credit card debt,” he said.

Fly Above The Clouds With The $35M Citation Hemisphere Jet
Set to be Textron's largest-ever corporate jet, the wonderful Citation Hemisphere could easily impress anyone in more ways than one. It's the first clean sheet design in its segment in more than 20 years, and it was specially designed to optimize every single space on board. This jet is still currently under development, yet it is already bragging about the most efficient technology for the engines and the cockpit.
The American aerospace company has imagined the widest cabin in its class, able to accommodate up to 19 passengers in style and comfort. Seats and cabinetry are custom-designed and handcrafted in-house, complemented by thermo-electric technology, a three-place divan that converts to a bed and a full galley where you could enjoy a few snacks.
The flight crew has also been considered, which is why this stunning jet packs a fly-by-wire transoceanic flight management system, with Honeywell's fully integrated Primus Epic avionics system and a special SmartView technology, offering a detailed 3D view of the outside world even in bad weather conditions.
In terms of power, two all-new Safran Silvercrest engines will propel the jet at speeds up to Mach 0.9 for more than 5,100 miles, with reduced noise and emissions. The finished product is set to cost as much as $35 million and it's scheduled to arrive by 2020. It's definitely worth the wait, but you could always go for other options that might even more sophisticated in the same price range.
New Delhi (ABC Live): CAATSA Effects : On August 2, 2017, the President signed into law the “Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act” (Public Law 115-44) (CAATSA), which among other things, imposes new sanctions on Iran, Russia, and North Korea.
Under Section 241 of CAATSA, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of State, was required to submit a report to Congress by January 29, 2018, regarding “senior foreign political figures and oligarchs in the Russian Federation” and “Russian parastatal entities.”
Additionally, under Section 242 of CAATSA, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, was also required to submit a report to Congress by January 29, 2018, describing in detail the potential effects of expanding existing U.S. sanctions that prohibit transactions or dealings by U.S. persons in “new debt” of longer than 14 days' maturity of sanctioned Russian financial institutions to also target sovereign debt issued by the Russian Federation and “the full range of derivative products.” As with the “oligarchs” report described above, this report on sovereign debt will not automatically impose any new sanctions, but it could be a precursor to future sanctions targeting Russian sovereign debt, depending on how U.S.-Russia relations evolve.
Expansion of Directive 4 to Cover New Deepwater, Arctic Offshore and Shale Projects Worldwide
With respect to other CAATSA provisions, OFAC has amended Directive 4 of Executive Order 13662 to prohibit U.S. persons from providing, exporting or re-exporting, directly or indirectly, goods, services (except for financial services) or technology in support of exploration or production for deepwater, Arctic offshore or shale projects (unconventional projects) worldwide that involve Russian companies subject to Directive 4 that meet all three of the following criteria:
The project was initiated on or after January 29, 2018.
on or after January 29, 2018. The project has the potential to produce oil in any location.
Any entity subject to Directive 41has either (i) a 33 percent or greater ownership interest or (ii) ownership of a majority of the voting interests in the project.
State Department Guidance on Section 225: Mandatory Secondary Sanctions for Significant Investments in Deepwater, Arctic Offshore or Shale Projects in Russia
On October 31, 2017, the State Department released public guidance on Section 225 of CAATSA, which requires the President to impose sanctions on “foreign persons” who knowingly, on or after September 1, 2017, make a “significant investment” in deepwater, Arctic offshore or shale oil projects in Russia (absent a presidential determination that such action is not in the U.S. national interest).
This guidance states that, in considering whether or not an investment qualifies as “significant” under these provisions, the State Department “will consider the totality of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investment and weigh various factors on a case-by-case basis,” including the following factors:
the significance of the transaction to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, in particular, where the transaction has a significant adverse impact on such interests
the nature and magnitude of the investment, including the size of the investment relative to the project's overall capitalization
the relation and significance of the investment to the Russian energy sector.
State Department Guidance on Section 232: Discretionary Secondary Sanctions Related to Development of Russian Energy Export Pipelines
The State Department also issued guidance on Section 232 of CAATSA, which provides the President with discretionary authority to impose sanctions related to Russian energy export pipelines. This provision has raised concerns in Europe due to its potential negative impacts on energy export pipelines from Russia to Europe. Specifically, Section 232 of CAATSA permits, but does not require, the President to impose sanctions on persons who knowingly (i) make an investment that “directly and significantly contributes to the enhancement of the ability of the Russian Federation to construct energy export pipelines;” or (ii) sell, lease or provide to Russia, for the construction of Russian energy export pipelines, goods, services, technology, information or support that “could directly and significantly facilitate the maintenance or expansion of the construction, modernization, or repair of energy pipelines,” provided that, in either case, the value of such investments, goods, services, technology or information exceed specified value thresholds.
OFAC Guidance on Section 226: Mandatory Secondary Sanctions Targeting Foreign Financial Institutions
Section 226 of CAATSA requires the President to prohibit the use of correspondent accounts in the United States by “foreign financial institutions” (FFIs) that knowingly facilitate “significant transactions” involving “significant investment” in Russian deepwater, Arctic offshore or shale projects, or certain defense-related transactions, as well as significant financial transactions on behalf of any Russian person included on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (“SDN List”) maintained by OFAC.
OFAC Guidance on Section 228: Mandatory Secondary Sanctions Targeting Transactions with “Foreign Sanctions Evaders”
Among other measures, Section 228 of CAATSA generally requires the President to impose sanctions on any foreign person who “knowingly . . . facilitates a significant transaction or transactions, including deceptive or structured transactions, for or on behalf of” persons subject to U.S. sanctions against Russia, subject to certain waiver authority.
OFAC Guidance on Section 233: Mandatory Secondary Sanctions Targeting Privatization of Russian State-Owned Assets
Section 233 of CAATSA requires the President to impose sanctions on any person who, “with actual knowledge,” makes or “facilitates” an investment of $10 million or more (or a combination of investments, each of $1 million or more and totaling $10 million or more during any 12-month period) that “directly and significantly contribute to the ability” of Russia to privatize state-owned assets in a “manner that unjustly benefits” officials of the Russian government or “close associates” or family members of those officials. As discussed in a previous client alert following the enactment of CAATSA, this measure is broadly written and is subject to discretionary application by OFAC. Accordingly, transactions associated with the privatization of Russian assets should be evaluated carefully to ensure that they do not provide exposure to secondary sanctions under CAATSA.
The new sanctions measures mandated by CAATSA significantly increase the need for both U.S. and non-U.S. companies to ensure that their business activities do not expose them to sanctions enforcement risks, particularly with respect to activities intersecting with the Russian energy sector. Despite the guidance provided by OFAC and the State Department in recent months, key terms in CAATSA are broadly defined, allowing the agencies broad latitude to enforce particular sanctions measures. Adding to the complexity of ensuring compliance with Russia sanctions, U.S. relations with Russia remain fluid, and there are many variables that could affect the way in which U.S. sanctions against Russia evolve this year that are impossible to predict. U.S. and non-U.S. businesses engaging in business with Russia should continue to monitor Russia sanctions developments and potential Russian responses to any additional sanctions to determine their potential impact and take steps designed to ensure compliance.
As per information some of the oligarchs on the Kremlin Report list are certainly President Vladimir Putin's close group and supporters out of these some reside in Russia and are already under sanctions, and others are abroad and in disagreement with the Kremlin.
Putin's human rights advisor Mikhail Fedorov was included on the list. The chair of the Moscow Helsinki Group, Soviet-era dissident and US citizen Lyudmila Alexeyeva (90), expressed astonishment and bewilderment at Fedorov's inclusion: “He is not rich or powerful—Fedorov is a human rights defender.” Whereas, according to the Kremlin's human rights advisor, “I believed there was some serious analytical work going on in Washington, but my secretary could have put together such a list in ten minutes—what was the US administration doing spending months compiling it?” (Newsru.com, January 31).
After the publication of the Kremlin Report, there was something of a collective sigh of relief from the Russian elite: The exaggerated fears subsided since an extended list that covered almost everyone and did not distinguish specifically between friend or foe seemed to be, in essence, harmless. President Donald Trump opposed CAATSA when it was passed by Congress last year; he signed it into law only because it had bipartisan support and any veto would have been easily overruled by the Legislative Branch. The poor quality of the Kremlin Report list thus raises the question whether the Trump administration might be deliberately trying to sabotage CAATSA and turn it into a toothless paper tiger. Will any further proposed sanctions materialize? CAATSA was passed in part specifically to punish the Kremlin for its covert involvement in the 2016 US presidential election. But if Trump does not believe the Russians promoted his victory, why punish them?
According to the main shareholder of the Russian financial institution Alpha-group, billionaire Mikhail Fridman, “My partners and I are in the Forbes' ranking, so we are in the Kremlin Report in accordance with the standards used by the US Treasury; but this will probably not hamper business.” Fridman is in the process of merging DEA AG—an international oil and gas company headquartered in Hamburg, Germany, which he acquired in 2015 for $6.1 billion—with Wintershall Holding GmbH, Germany's largest oil and natural gas producer, owned by BASF. The multi-billion-dollar merger would give Fridman control of a third of the joint conglomerate or maybe more after a pending initial public offering (IPO). Fridman told journalists the process of merging Wintershall and DEA “is going as planned, and I do not see any additional risks because of the Kremlin Report.” Wintershall is financing the building of the Nord Stream Two underwater natural gas pipelines from Russia to Germany, which will allow Moscow to terminate transit through Ukraine. Washington opposes Nord Stream Two. According to Fridman, the joint Wintershall/DEA “will consider continued financing of Nord Stream Two” (TASS, February 1).
Putin summarized the overall attitude in Moscow after the Kremlin Report's release: “It is an unfriendly act, but we will watch and see what it means in practice and are ready to rebuild relations.” Putin continued, “We were ready to take serious retaliatory action, to reduce our relations [with the US] to zero, but at present we will refrain doing it,” apparently implying the published Kremlin Report is meaningless and harmless. The United States and Russia can work together in combating terrorism: According to Putin, “The Americans give us intelligence on terrorists, and we, in turn give too, as just recently in Washington [during the visit of Aleksandr Bortnikov] our FSB [Federal Security Service] director.” “But,” continued Putin, “It is stupid—the US lumps us together with Iran and North Korea and then asks for our help in containing Iran and North Korea” (Interfax, January 31).
Indeed, the three top Russian intelligence chiefs secretly visited Washington last week—Bortnikov, the director of the FSB, Sergei Naryshkin, the head of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and Colonel General Igor Korobov, the chief of Russian military intelligence (GRU). Little is currently known about the visit. Apparently Naryshkin and Bortnikov met with Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director Mike Pompeo. Korobov it could be assumed, met with his US counterparts from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). Bortnikov is under European Union sanctions, but has not been sanctioned by the US. Both Naryshkin and Korobov are under US personal sanctions. Korobov was sanctioned in December 2016 for alleged interference in the 2016 elections. Meetings of Russian and US top intelligence officials do happen: In May 2017, Pompeo visited Moscow. But a joint visit by all three top Russian intelligence chiefs to Washington—and with two of them under sanctions—is unprecedented (Interfax, February 1).
According to official readouts, the US and Russian intelligence chiefs “discussed terrorism and national security.” According to the leading Duma deputy from the ruling United Russia party, Vyacheslav Nikonov, “The Americans wanted to discuss Syria and the Kurdish problem as well as the Taliban in Afghanistan” (Regnum, January 31). Putin also insinuated—Iran and North Korea. Maybe by sending a big intelligence posse to Washington and dangling the prospect of cooperation on important issues, which the Trump administration has been long seeking, the Kremlin dodged a bullet. Reportedly (Atlanticcouncil.org, January 30), at the last minute, the Kremlin Report was diluted (expanded) into a harmless call-all list. If so, that was indeed good timing.
Today at the Gramercy Theater in NYC, Spotify's Chief R&D Officer Gustav Söderström announced a brand new free version of the Spotify mobile app.
By leveraging their investment in machine learning, Spotify's new free tier recommends music to users on the fly. That said, the free tier has always limited users to shuffle. With the new version, users can listen on-demand to whatever song they want, as many times as they want, as long as those songs appear on one of the 15 personalized discovery playlists like Daily Mix, Discover Weekly, Release Radar or Today's Top Hits.
In total, that's around 750 tracks (>40 hours of music) that Spotify is serving up to users for on-demand listening.
Spotify will also make recommendations in the free mobile version based on existing user-made playlists, from the songs on those playlists to the name of the playlist itself. The company is calling this “assisted playlisting,” which essentially means that each time you search for a song to add to a playlist, Spotify will make recommendations similar to it as well.
Finally, Spotify has built in a low-data mode (called data saver) that cuts data consumption by up to 75 percent. In the past, Spotify didn't allow offline listening for free, meaning that users were somewhat tethered to wifi if they needed to conserve data.
With the new data consumption system, which caches music ahead of time to stream via 3G, users can actually listen to much more music with wireless data. Alongside utilizing 3G, Spotify is also optimizing the streaming itself as well as the app (including imagery and other UI elements) to save data and power.
All that said, advertisements will still run on the free tier of Spotify. Which is part of the company's strategy not only for funding a free tier but for converting users to premium.
In 2014, Spotify introduced its free tier to mobile, letting users listen to their playlists on shuffle with ads. It was a huge part of Spotify's free-tier growth. In fact, today Spotify has 90 million users on the free tier. And many of those convert to paid users — the company now has 70 million paid subscribers.
“If you're on a date listening to music, you're not going to want an ad to come on,” said Spotify's Global Head of Creator Services Troy Carter.
The company has focused heavily on mobile since 2014, especially where it concerns the premium mobile player.
Spotify is built upon three tiers: ubiquity, personalization and freemium. Söderström explained that Spotify thinks of itself as the broadcast radio of the 90s, where discovery of great music was supported by ads and drove people to the record stores.
Spotify's free tier represents broadcast radio for Spotify, and is a critical piece of Spotify's overall strategy as paid services like Apple Music continue to grow.
Here, from Facebook, is a list of the world's most venomous snakes, as measured by the LD50 (the amount of venom it takes to kill 50% of a given prey type, expressed as milligrams of venom per kilogram of prey). Note that the top 11 are all from Australia, as are 21 of the top 25.
Now why are there so many venomous snakes in Australia? (I think the same holds for venomous spiders.) I can think of two or three reasons, and I'm sure it's been discussed in the literature, but it's Saturday and I'll leave this for readers to think about or look up.
But I do want to mention the #1 most venomous snake: the Inland taipan. How venomous is it? Ask Wikipedia (my emphasis):
Based on the median lethal dose value in mice, its venom, drop for drop, is by far the most toxic of any snake – much more so than even sea snakes – and it has the most toxic venom of any reptile when tested on human heartcell culture. Unlike most snakes, the inland taipan is a specialist mammalhunter so its venom is specially adapted to kill warm-blooded species. It is estimated that one bite possesses enough lethality to kill at least 100 fully grown men, and, depending on the nature of the bite, it has the potential to kill someone in as little as 30 to 45 minutes if left untreated. It is an extremely fast and agile snake that can strike instantly with extreme accuracy, often striking multiple times in the same attack, and it envenoms in almost every case.
Of course that raises the question of why it's wasting venom if its prey are smaller than humans (which they are), and it could kill even a kangaroo dozens of times over with a single bite. I'll leave that for you to ponder as well. In the meantime, here's a video on the critter and the overly macho man who provokes it (if you want to see Steve Irwin doing the same thing, go here):
Wonder Woman has inspired generations of women and girls since her 1941 debut in DC's All Star Comics #8. This Amazonian warrior goddess has been heralded as a beacon of feminism, dashing the "damsel in distress" persona that was once common in entertainment. Like her superhero counterparts, Wonder Woman has been transformed over and over during the past 7 decades. Her latest film incarnation, 2017's Wonder Woman, has introduced Princess Diana to a yet another generation of budding fans.
Sometimes, It's not enough to see your hero on screen — sometimes, you just want to be her. Specialty shops, such as those on Etsy and the memorabilia retailer Film Jackets make this easier and more stylish than ever. Check out our favorite Wonder Woman cosplay picks from across the web.
Wonder Woman Leather Jacket
While photos or illustrations of Diana Prince actually wearing a jacket are few and far between (she usually wears much less) Film Jackets' adaptation certainly captures the aura of the character. It also resembles experimental Wonder Woman costumes that outfitted the hero in biker jackets and tight pants. These were seen in comic art and collectibles from 2010 to 2012.

The jacket is available in two styles. "Brown waxed," pictured here, is well suited to the Wonder Woman look of the recent movie where she's fighting in the first World War. The "classic" style gives a nod to Wonder Woman's current color scheme of burgundy, blue and yellow gold. As an added bonus to fans, purchase of the Jacket from Film Jackets includes a #WonderWoman t-shirt, which is black with a gold logo.
The Classic Tiara
Every girl likes to feel like a princess — a lasso wielding, butt kicking princess, that is. The Etsy shop Mikarya offers Princess Diana's crown in two styles: lightweight, gold-tone plastic, and then real metal, "giving it a more realistic feel."

Pair either of these tiaras with the jacket above, and you'll be ready to apply to the Justice League.
Walk Like A Wonder Woman
Every girl wonder needs a good pair of shoes. SavillaCreations on Etsy offers the original-styled Wonder Woman boots. Made from vinyl faux leather, the bootlets slip over your own shoes, allowing you to customize any comfortable footwear. The shop owner created this slip-over style in the 1980s for a fashion photo shoot, and it has since become a cosplay sensation. SavillaCreations also offers styles mimicking Supergirl, Batgirl, Sailor Moon and many others.
Etsy's Deckofab shop puts a different spin on Wonder Woman cosplay. Their high heel shoes are made from fabric featuring Wonder Woman comic book frames and are an equally cute addition to your cosplay wardrobe.

The Kaiser Permanente Vallejo Medical Center Breast Care Center has received a new three-year accreditation by the National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers, a program administered by the American College of Surgeons, Kaiser officials announced.
Three years ago, the Kaiser Permanente Vallejo Medical Center Breast Care Center became the first such center in Solano County to receive the designation. Six other Kaiser Permanente sites in Northern California — Oakland, Central Valley, Martinez, San Rafael, Santa Clara and Santa Rosa — also have it.
Accreditation by the agency is given to those centers that have voluntarily committed to provide the highest level of quality breast care and that undergo a rigorous evaluation process and performance review.
“To be recognized for our comprehensive care and multi-disciplinary approach tells us that we are on the right path,” said breast cancer surgeon Gillian Kuehner, director of the Breast Care Center.
That multi-disciplinary approach to breast cancer treatment is a hallmark of Kaiser Vallejo's Breast Care Center, officials said. A Breast Care Conference is held every Tuesday at the hospital with representatives from surgery, radiology, pathology, oncology, nursing and radiation oncology all in attendance, they said.
“All newly diagnosed breast cancer patients are reviewed during these conferences,” Kuehner said. “The patient's clinical presentation is discussed, appropriate imaging and pathology reviewed, and pertinent medical and family history are assessed. A preliminary treatment recommendation is then formulated with input from a variety of disciplines, giving the patient a comprehensive treatment plan that is completely individual and unique to their personal circumstances. We personalize the care for each patient.”
Clinical trials are also a valuable tool available to center patients, officials said. The Kaiser Permanente Northern California Oncology Clinical Trials program is based at the Vallejo Medical Center and is one of the nation's leading clinical trial groups, they said.
“Our robust National Cancer Institute sponsored oncology clinical trials research program allows members to participate in new cancer treatments even before they are FDA approved,” said Lou Fehrenbacher, hematologist/oncologist and director of the Oncology Clinical Trials program. “Having that level of access to new treatments helps us provide the best care to all of our patients and places our doctors at the front of medical advances.”

Its name sounds like an artifact of the Cold War, but the Voice of America — the international news source funded by the U.S. government — has changed geography and technology. VOA just began a 24-hour Russian-language news channel on several platforms to reach Russian speakers throughout the old Soviet empire — a clear pushback against Russian government-run programming. Yet it's home-front happenings that have put VOA in the news: first, the 2013 repeal of a law restricting the use of VOA-produced news inside the U.S., and then, toward the end of the Obama administration, a law that pulled the plug on a bipartisan board supervising the Broadcasting Board of Governors and replaced it with a CEO who's selected by the president and confirmed by the Senate. That's sounded alarm bells for people who worry that President Trump might want to convert VOA into his own megaphone. John F. Lansing, who's the head of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, told NPR that it would be “illegal” for the administration to tell VOA what to broadcast. And It's director, journalist Amanda Bennett, details an operation that is government-funded, but, she says, not government-run.
CLICK HERE TO LISTEN TO THIS INTERVIEW ON THE 'PATT MORRISON ASKS' PODCAST »
The Voice of America is celebrating its 75th anniversary. How has its mission changed over the years?
During the period immediately after the Cold War, there was a kind of loss of faith in the mission, that the world was all OK and everything had happened the way it was supposed to. But really, its mission never did change, and you can see that right now, with the world being much more stressful, much more tense.
Our mission is exactly the same as it was back in the founding, and that is to bring objective news and information to countries that have no other access to it, and to tell America's story overseas.
And so the geography of listeners has changed then?
Our very first broadcast was into Germany in the middle of World War II. Well, Germany is no longer a place where we broadcast into. The Voice of America broadcasts into large parts of Africa, into large parts of Asia, Indonesia, China, Cambodia, Vietnam, and large parts of Russia and the former Soviet republics.
The VOA's mission came up in the news recently after a couple of Trump aides were sent to check out the VOA, and even though the Obama administration did essentially the same when it came in, it did raise some questions about whether President Trump would want to turn it into a President Trump channel.
That ignores the fact that the law, the broadcast law which has been in place, still remains in place — and wasn't the least bit affected by any of those things. And that really is where our firewall protection comes from: from this law that establishes us [as] an independent source of news and information — separate from the U.S. government, separate from influence from the U.S. government. Separate from any government, frankly. That has not changed.
Two VOA online postings created some controversy themselves. One was a tweet of the White House's erroneous statement, posted without challenge, that the inauguration crowd was the largest for any inauguration ever. The other was a story about an ethics complaint against the Trump administration. You pulled the tweet, and took down the story until the VOA got a response from the White House.
That's very interesting because the two instances you describe have actually opposite ideas. Both of them were completely routine decisions but one of them was taken as a pro-Trump move; one of them was taken as an anti-Trump move, and they both were were kind of normal, routine things.
One of them was during a live-tweeting session. The person who was live-tweeting it forgot to put quotation marks around [Press Secretary Sean] Spicer's remarks, making it look like we were endorsing it. We caught that within the newsroom and corrected it almost immediately, but not before a bunch of people had tweeted out, Aha! We've caught you! You're now spreading the Trump administration's word! And of course it was just an honest mistake.
The other one is something that I feel very strongly and very passionately about. According to our charter, according to our history, and journalistic principles, we do fair and we do balance and we do honest reporting and that means you don't do a story that has a single source. You don't do a story that doesn't show the opposite viewpoint. If you're making a criticism of somebody, you allow the person or the institution you're criticizing to make a comment. And this was a story that was critical of things having to do with President Trump, and it went out without having any comment there. So I said, go put some comment in — as I've been saying since 1975 in every story I've ever done.
The idea that somehow journalists would take this to be an example of some kind of bias is really kind of horrifying to me.
Over the years there has been criticism that it's propaganda — it's American propaganda but that it's propaganda nonetheless.
I'm always kind of curious as to why the same criticism isn't leveled at the BBC, which has exactly the same journalistic standards and missions that we do. So we're doing exactly the same thing. We are legally separated from the government — that is actually in law — by something that we informally call the firewall. People take it very seriously on both sides of the equation, on the VOA side and on the rest of the government side.
Your audience is no longer only a radio audience but digital, too.
We broadcast — I use the word broadcast meaning just send out — in television, in radio, in digital, in various video means of transmission. We're working on mobile products. Essentially any way that somebody would get their news and information, that's the way we deliver it.
This year, we've had the biggest audience growth in our history. Our audience went up by 50 million people and that brings us to 236 million people around the world, which is bigger than the audiences of three of the biggest cable providers in the United States by about a factor of 10.
Where was most of that growth?
The bulk of it was in Indonesia and Latin America, and it was for a couple of reasons. One is, in countries where we're able to do that, we have an extremely robust series of partnerships with all the major networks in Indonesia, and we form a part of their newscasts. In Latin America, we have essentially evolved the model where the Voice of America is the Washington bureau for a very large number of Latin American stations.
DUBAI (Reuters) - U.S President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital could provide a lifeline to militants after the setbacks they suffered this year, the de facto leader of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has warned.
Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahayan also said that the UAE hopes that Washington would reconsider its decision.
Trump's announcement has sparked widespread opposition across the Middle East, with many warning it could affect Washington's role as a Middle East peace broker.
“The U.S. move could throw a lifebuoy to terrorist and armed groups, which have begun to lose ground in the region,” said Sheikh Mohammed, speaking to a delegation from the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
The comments were carried in a report on state news agency WAM published late on Saturday.
Iraq on Saturday declared final victory over Islamic State after Iraqi forces drove its last remnants from the country, while the group is on the back foot in neighbouring Syria, where an offensive backed by Russia has driven the group out of most of its strongholds.
Palestinians want Arab East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, to be the capital of a state they hope would be emerged from peace talks with Israel. Israel has annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognized internationally and regards the area as part of its capital.
Sheikh Mohammed said Trump's unilateral decision violates U.N. resolutions, and urged Washington to “reconsider its move and work basically in an effective and neutral manner to draft true principles for peace that serve all and realise development and stability in the region”, according to WAM.
Turning to Yemen, Sheikh Mohammed said the Saudi-led Arab coalition, which includes the UAE, remained committed to a political solution to end the war that began in 2015 when the Iran-aligned Houthis advanced on the southern port city of Aden forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee into exile.
But he said that any solution “will also not be at the expense of enabling a military militia that operates outside the state authority and posing a direct threat to the security and stability of the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the region at large.”

Billie Lourd lost her mother, Carrie Fisher, and her grandmother, Debbie Reynolds, to end 2016 on the lowest note imaginable. The Scream Queens star took to Instagram today to speak out about the tragic losses and to thank the millions of fans who have helped give her strength during some of the darkest days of her life. “Receiving all of your prayers and kind words over the past week has given me strength during a time I thought strength could not exist. There are no words to express how much I will miss my Abadaba and my one and only Momby. Your love and support means the world to me,” Billie Lourd wrote as a caption to the photo below. A photo posted by Billie Lourd (@praisethelourd) on Jan 2, 2017 at 10:09am PST This was the first time that Billie Lourd addressed the public directly since her mother, Carrie Fisher, 60, died following a heart attack on an airplane. As previously reported by the Inquisitr, Fisher was rushed to UCLA Medical Center following an “episode” on a flight in from London. Once she arrived at the hospital, Carrie was stabilized, but she was still in critical condition. After a few days, Carrie Fisher died, and the world learned that she was unconscious for the duration of her hospital stay. One day after Fisher's tragic passing, there were breaking news reports that her mother, Debbie Reynolds, was rushed to the hospital following what appeared to be a stroke. Within hours, it was reported that Reynolds had passed away. Billie Lourd lost her mom and her grandma in a 24ish-hour period. According to People Magazine, Reynolds' son, Todd Fisher, spoke about his 84-year-old's mother's passing and the significance of her dying just one day after Carrie. “She didn't die of a broken heart. She just left to be with Carrie. It wasn't that she was sitting around inconsolable, not at all. She simply said that she didn't get to see Carrie come back from London, she expressed how much she loved my sister. She then said she really wanted to be with Carrie. In those precise words, and within 15 minutes from that conversation she faded out and within 30 minutes, she technically was gone,” Fisher told 20/20 in an episode that aired on Friday, Dec. 30. “From the family's perspective, this is Debbie's destiny. She didn't want to leave Carrie and did not want to her to be alone. We're broken-hearted, those of us that are left behind. We also are happy that they're together. It's horrible, it's beautiful, it's magical they are together, it's beyond words, it's beyond understanding,” he added. Billie Lourd has undoubtedly been having the hardest time with this as she was extremely close to both her mother and her grandmother. The 24-year-old visited Late Night With Seth Meyers about a month ago where she talked about her mom and grandma and sort of “going joke” the family has had. “[My grandmother] gets really upset when I get called ‘Carrie Fisher's daughter.' She wants people to call me ‘Debbie Reynolds' granddaughter.' It's very offensive to her. She does not like to be cut out—not at all. She started it. It's her fault,” Billie told Seth, according to E! News. Billie Lourd is said to be leaning on family and close friends during this difficult time. There have been reports that she has been comforted by her rumored boyfriend Taylor Lautner. In fact, the Twilight star's most recent Instagram post is a tribute of sorts to Billie Lourd. A photo posted by Taylor Lautner (@taylorlautner) on Dec 27, 2016 at 4:40pm PST “This girl is one of the strongest, most fearless individuals I've ever met. Absolutely beautiful inside and out. I'm lucky to know you @praisethelourd.. ❤️, me,” he wrote. Billie Lourd is doing the best that she can at this time. Fans continue to send their prayers and condolences to her and her family.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - A Chilean man who was sexually abused by a priest as a boy will urge Pope Francis to sack “toxic” bishops who covered up the assaults, he said on Tuesday ahead of a face-to-face meeting with the leader of the Catholic Church.

Juan Carlos Cruz, who has become a symbol of the Church's abuse crisis, will spend several days in the Vatican as a guest of the pope in the residence where he lives. Strong papal action in Chile would send a long-overdue message to the entire Church, he told Reuters in an interview.
“I would say ‘hold these bishops accountable, fire a few of them, if not many of them, but fire them and not give them a cushy job here at the Vatican,'” Cruz said.
“Like in a company (I would say) ‘you need to be preparing your resumé'. That's what I would say to these bishops.”
Cruz and two other victims, Jimmy Hamilton and Jose Andres Murillo, are each due to spend several hours with the pope on a visit that follows an extraordinary April 11 letter in which Francis acknowledged he had made “grave mistakes” in handling the sexual abuse crisis in Chile.
In that letter, Francis said there had been a “lack of truthful and balanced information” about the situation in Chile. He invited the victims whose words he had once dismissed as “slander” to the Vatican to seek their forgiveness and ordered all of Chile's bishops to a summit with him next month.
“I hope the Holy Father realises that he is surrounded by some toxic people who need to leave ...,” Cruz said, adding that some Chilean bishops were “guilty of misinforming the pope”.
Cruz, who now lives in the United States, was a victim of the Rev. Fernando Karadima who was found guilty in a Vatican investigation in 2011 of abusing boys in Santiago in the 1970s and 1980s.

Cruz and other victims have accused Bishop Juan Barros of the diocese of Osorno of having witnessed the abuse by Karadima, who was Barros' mentor in Santiago.
Karadima, now 87 and still living in Chile, has always denied the allegations and Barros said he was unaware of any wrongdoing.
But Barros and other bishops were put under the spotlight in January when the pope sent one of the Vatican's most experienced sexual abuse investigators, Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta, to New York and Chile to talk to victims and bishops.
Scicluna produced a 2,300 report, which prompted the pope to call next month's meeting.
Cruz said he hoped the pope would take decisive action in order to “send a message to the world that Chile is an example of what's going to happen all over if this culture of abuse and cover up continues”.
He said he was confident that some good would come out of his meeting with the pope. Francis is due to have extended meetings with each of the three men individually over the weekend and then together on Monday.

“I told him, ‘Holy father, I do not want to be used as a PR exercise ...,'” he said. “Good or beautiful words or tears will not cut it. There has to be concrete action taken. There's no more time left.”
Improving its record to 7-1, the Joel Barlow High boys volleyball team defeated Fairfield Ludlowe 3-0 (25-9, 25-13, 25-11) on Monday, April 17.
Austin Hauser led Barlow with 25 assists. He also had four aces.
Matt Cruz had eight kills and one block. Reed Wilkerson had five kills and three blocks.
Officers were dispatched to the Student Money Management/Office of Equity and Inclusion Building at 7:15 P.M. last night in response to a vehicle that had crashed into the Student Services Annex.
According to Sam Houston State University Police Chief Kevin Morris, a white Dodge Ram 1500 pickup truck struck the building, causing substantial damage to the outside exterior wall and interior of the building.
The driver reported that the truck's accelerator had become stuck, causing the vehicle to continue moving forward into the east wall of the building.
“Upon investigation of the accident, the officer determined that the driver was not under the influence of alcohol or any other substance,” Morris said.
According to Morris, both the driver and passenger were 19-year-old males, and neither of them sustained any injuries. However, the impact caused severe damage to the front end of the vehicle.
No citations were issued.
BLOEMFONTEIN - South Africa's new Global T20 league will go ahead, Cricket South Africa pledged on Friday, but it is expected to lose money for the first two seasons.
No broadcast deal has yet been signed but CSA vice-president and acting chief executive Thabang Moroe said negotiations were well-advanced. "It is just a matter of agreeing the finer details," he said.
Moroe said a deal in the region of US $17-18 million (14.5 million euros-15.4 million euros) was being sought, but admitted that CSA was expecting a net loss of about $25 million, while franchise owners would lose about $1.5 million in the first season.
Moroe and CSA president Chris Nenzani briefed reporters for the first time since last week's announcement of the departure of chief executive Haroon Lorgat, which media speculation linked to unhappiness over Lorgat's negotiations for the league. Nenzani said: "We are working very hard to ensure the Global T20 league launches on November 3. The key issue is to get a broadcast deal on the table."
The league is planned as South Africa's equivalent of the Indian Premier League and Australia's Big Bash League.
Seven of the eight teams are foreign-owned and several leading international players as well as all South Africa's top players are committed to playing.
Moroe said owners had been consulted. "They are all committed to staying in the league and the owners are happy to accept there will be losses for the first two years." Moroe said negotiations for a title sponsor were taking place but admitted: "Everything hangs on a broadcast deal."
(Reuters) - The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is considering changes to a California desert plan that had set aside areas for renewable energy development, a move it says would promote more wind and solar projects on federal lands.
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, in a statement on Thursday, said it would consider amending the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan as part of a broader federal effort to unwind regulations that impede energy development.
The process is also aimed at making more land available for wireless broadband infrastructure, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Katharine MacGregor said in the statement.
“We need to reduce burdens on all domestic energy development, including solar, wind and other renewables,” she said.
The news drew praise from the wind and solar industries but criticism from California officials and environmental groups.
Reconsidering the plan would reopen conflicts over renewable energy development, conservation and other uses of the desert while “creating a cloud of uncertainty,” Karen Douglas, a commissioner with the California Energy Commission, said in an emailed statement.
The Bureau of Land Management is part of the Interior Department, which has made similar moves to open up more federal land and waters to oil and gas exploration.
The plan was jointly hatched by California and the federal government in an eight-year process finalized in September 2016.
Solar and wind developers had criticized the designation of just 388,000 acres of the 10.8 million acres covered by the plan for renewable energy development.
The California Wind Energy Association's executive director, Nancy Rader, said on Friday it was “ironic” that the Trump administration had moved to expand areas for renewable energy while the Obama administration had closed them off.
“We are happy for the BLM to take another look,” Rader said in an interview.
The Solar Energy Industries Association said in a statement it looked forward to working with the Department of the Interior.
Environmental groups panned the move.
“There is no new data to support changing the plan,” said Mike Sweeney, executive director of The Nature Conservancy in California, in a statement, noting that it was “exhaustively developed” with eight years of data collection, scientific analyses and significant public and private input.
Kenny Bayless, the veteran boxing referee who has worked several of Floyd Mayweather's fights, will not be assigned to Mayweather's Aug. 26 bout against UFC champion Conor McGregor, the Los Angeles Times learned Monday.
Bob Bennett, executive director of the Nevada State Commission said Chairman Anthony Marnell III made the decision after learning of Bayless' public comments critical of the novel Mayweather-McGregor bout being made.
McGregor said at his Friday media day that he didn't believe Bayless should work the fight based on his comments.
“His views … he went public on what he thought the fight was,” McGregor told reporters. “He can't be involved in the event.”
Bennett said Marnell had already made up his mind about Bayless before McGregor spoke.
“Conor McGregor had nothing to do with Kenny Bayless' removal,” Bennett said.
The commission will decide Wednesday morning at its meeting who will serve as referee and judges for the bout, which could threaten the 2015 Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao bout as the most lucrative combat sports event in history.
Bayless worked that bout, along with Mayweather's following September 2015 victory over Andre Berto. He also was the third man in the ring for Mayweather's 2014 second fight against Marcos Maidana, and Mayweather's 2013 triumph over Canelo Alvarez.
The contenders to work Mayweather-McGregor are believed to be Russell Mora, Robert Byrd and Tony Weeks.

It was not hard to see this coming.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had long ago begun playing a political poker game with Kinder Morgan, and it was quickly apparent the hand he was holding consisted of see-through cards.
Trudeau made it clear he desperately needed the pipeline expansion to proceed. He vowed, “this pipeline will be built” over and over again, even after Kinder Morgan set a May 31 deadline for potentially walking away from the project entirely.
Kinder Morgan's concerns about political delays and uncertainties hovering over the project hardly disappeared after that deadline was imposed and there was absolutely no chance of them being eased within that tight time frame.
The B.C. NDP government was not going to back off its somewhat muted and limited opposition to the project, even if its onetime fiery anti-pipeline rhetoric had shrunk into an apparent weak court challenge or two.
The various court challenges from First Nations and some B.C. municipalities against the pipeline were not going to disappear either.

So it quickly became apparent that the chances of Kinder Morgan sticking around without some kind of huge financial investment from the Trudeau government were pretty well nil.
And Trudeau could hardly back away from his vow the pipeline would be built. He had gone all-in in pledging his support for it and had invested his own personal political capital in the project.
The only question was what form that hefty financial investment would take: indemnification, partnership or full-on ownership.
When no prospective investors emerged, the ownership option came into view.

The trap that Trudeau was forced to walk into was set by that May 31 deadline and the issues — uncertainty and delays — it brought into light.
It is unclear whether this trap could have been avoided if Trudeau had acted more decisively in championing the pipeline much earlier than he did.
For years, Kinder Morgan experienced nothing but court challenges, protests, and battles from B.C. municipal and provincial governments. The federal government did not have the project's back until the past few months, which in Kinder Morgan's view, was simply too late.
And so Trudeau was forced to sit in on that poker game, showing all his cards. The pot in that game turns out to be pretty expensive — perhaps more than $12 billion when all the chips are counted.

Whirling dervishes enthrall public at PNCA
ISLAMABAD:The arts and culture departments arranged a number of ceremonies in the city to mark the 70th birthday of Pakistan.
The Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA) arranged the special performance of whirling dervishes from the Republic of Turkey for citizens to mark the Independence Day.
Specially flown from Istanbul to participate in the 70th Independence Day celebration of Pakistan, the Istanbul Historical Turkish Music Ensemble attracted a huge crowd to the Grand Music Show, one of the month-long series of events being organized by the PNCA to mark the Pakistan's Independence Day. A 30-minute performance was an unusual experience of spiritual journey of tranquility, peace and fulfillment. The presentation included naat, reed flute improvisations, peshrev, the sultan veled cycle, four selams and a prayer.
The music from all four provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan and AJK was also presented. The singers included renowned Shaukat Ali, Ghulam Abbas, Akhtar Channal Zahri group from Balochistan, Zafar Ali group from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Bano Rehmat from AJK, Gulshan Jehan, Usman Ali Raees and Raga Boys.
A 16-member National Performing Arts Group (NPAG) also presented a thrilling performance on the song ‘Pakistan banana hae'. Clad in different regional and national attires, the young artistes gripped the theatre with their synchronised moves and spontaneous expressions.
Earlier, the PNCA Director General Syed Jamal Shah thanked the Turkish Ambassador S. Babür Girgin for bringing the Ensemble to the Pakistan's Independence Day celebrations. He said both countries have deep-rooted friendly and brotherly relations for the decades. Both countries can learn from each other through the exchange of art and cultural and joint initiatives.
Meanwhile, National Institute of Folk and Traditional Heritage (Lok Virsa) celebrated the Independence Day organising exhibition and colorful activities for youth.–OUR STAFF REPORTER

Florida-A US service dog unexpectedly gave birth to eight puppies in the middle of the Tampa International Airport, just before her owners boarded their flight. Eleanor ‘Ellie' Rigby, a two-year-old yellow Labrador who serves as a guide dog, delivered the pups with the help of Tampa Fire Rescue's medical team. Her owners knew she was pregnant, but did not realise how close she was to going into labour.
Ellie and father Nugget are now parents to seven males and one female pup.
Service animals are trained to assist people with disabilities, including guide dogs for the blind and hearing-impaired as well as for mental health and seizure alerts.
An airport spokesperson told Fox 13 that Ellie and Nugget's owv ners, a woman and her daughter, were set to board their flight to Philadelphia with the two service dogs when Ellie went into labour. The family - and their eight new additions - missed their flight.
Ellie successfully delivered her puppies amid a crowd of onlookers and with a little help from Tampa Fire Rescue staff Larry Glanton and Natalie Brown. Airport officials posted on Twitter: “Ruff day for this mama at Gate F80!”
The surprise delivery ended with applause and barks in the concourse.
The family and all 10 dogs will be driving all 1,000 miles (1600km) from Tampa to Philadelphia instead, the Miami Herald reported.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan played down a spate of recent Taliban attacks on Wednesday, saying violence levels were still lower than average as some insurgents talked peace - a situation he described as “talking and fighting.”

“You see mid-level, senior-level Taliban leaders engaging with Afghans,” said Army General John Nicholson, adding that a lot of the diplomatic activity was taking place “off the stage.”
Nicholson's remarks came the same day that gunmen armed with assault rifles and grenade launchers attempted to penetrate the heavily fortified headquarters of the Afghan interior ministry, battling security forces for more than two hours in the latest attack on the capital Kabul.
The attack was a reminder of the challenges facing U.S.-backed Afghan forces even after 16 years of war, including in the capital Kabul. Last month, two explosions in Kabul killed at least 26 people, including nine journalists.
Nicholson said initial indications suggested Taliban and the Haqqani network were behind the attack, even though Islamic State claimed responsibility.
In his remarks to Pentagon reporters, Nicholson sought to underscore data and events he said point to forward progress in America's longest war. Critics warn the U.S.-backed Afghan army cannot promise to defeat the Taliban or overcome Afghanistan's vast political divisions and entrenched corruption.
More than 2,400 U.S. forces have died in the conflict.
Nicholson pointed to unreleased data showing a 30 percent decline in attacks initiated by the insurgents between February and April, compared with the average over the previous five years. Attacks increased after the Taliban announced their spring offensive on April 25 but the violence was still 10 to 12 percent lower, he said.
U.S. officials in recent years have declined to offer data on levels of attacks initiated by insurgents, saying that the United States no longer had a big enough intelligence gathering operation in Afghanistan to publish reliable estimates.
Nicholson acknowledged much of his data drew upon the Afghan government's estimates, which the U.S. government has long considered less reliable. But when pressed during the news briefing, Nicholson said he was still confident in the trend suggested by the data.
“If this were a matter of a few percentage points, I'd have less confidence,” he said.
He also drew comparisons to Colombia, where insurgents from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and government forces were fighting before a 2016 peace agreement.
Still, many experts say there are huge differences between the Colombian and Afghan conflicts.
“The idea that we're making the same kind of progress (as in Colombia) is grasping at straws for justification,” said Jason Dempsey, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for New American Security think-tank who deployed twice to Afghanistan.
Nicholson highlighted a grassroots “peace movement,” which he said was not aligned to any party in Afghanistan's nearly 17-year-old conflict. He said it has held events in 20 Afghan provinces, calling for ceasefires and peace talks.
“And this has never happened before in Afghanistan, to my knowledge, over 20 provinces,” he said.
Asked about how this would affect the U.S. mission in Afghanistan, Nicholson said: “The end state of the policy is to achieve a reconciliation.”

Heavy machines move imported iron ore at the dock in Rizhao in eastern China's Shandong province. China announced on Aug. 14, 2017, it will cut off imports of North Korean coal, iron ore and other goods in three weeks under U.N. sanctions imposed over the North's nuclear and missile programs.

Beijing — China announced Monday it will cut off imports of North Korean coal, iron ore and other goods in three weeks under U.N. sanctions imposed over the North's nuclear and missile programs.
China, the isolated North's main trading partner, has been reluctant to push leader Kim Jong-un's regime too hard for fear it might collapse. But Beijing is increasingly frustrated with Pyongyang and supported a U.N. Security Council ban on Aug. 5 on coal and other key goods.
The Chinese customs agency said it will stop processing imports of North Korean coal, iron and lead ores and fish at midnight on Sept. 5.
“After that, entry of these goods will be prohibited,” said an agency statement.
The announcement follows an escalating exchange of angry words between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim's government. Trump declared the U.S. military “locked and loaded” while Pyongyang threatened to fire four missiles into waters near the U.S. territory of Guam.
The latest U.N. sanctions are intended to block North Korean exports worth $1 billion — a significant share of total exports valued at $3 billion last year.
China stopped importing North Korean coal in February but total trade has risen. That prompted Trump to accuse Beijing in July of failing to use its economic leverage to stop Pyongyang's pursuit of nuclear weapons.
Other North Korean exports to China also include clothing, knitwear and plastic rain ponchos, which appear not to be affected by the latest sanctions.
Beijing had long been Pyongyang's only diplomatic defender but agreed in March 2016 to sanctions against the North following its test of a long-range missile.
Still, Chinese leaders oppose blocking all trade with the impoverished North, which they argue might cause widespread hunger.
The Chinese import cut will come the week of Foundation Day on Sept. 9, the North Korean holiday commemorating the founding of the country's government in 1948.
North Korean imports of Chinese oil, consumer goods and other products rose 36.7 percent from a year earlier in the first half of this year to 1.1 billion yuan ($165 million), according to Chinese customs data. Chinese imports from the North fell 7.6 percent in the same period to 611 million yuan ($91 million), squeezing the North's revenue.

The Pope's views on homosexuality and women should change, says former Irish President Mary McAleese.
Focusing on homosexuality, she says she cannot go to the World Meeting of Families when the Pope visits Ireland in August, as it does not include LGBTI people.
In her view, the Church's “evil” teaching on homosexuality gave rise to homophobia, ruining people's lives and causing them “to live in dark shadows.”
“[The] World Meeting of Families, here was he [the Pope] saying it was for all God's family no matter what you believe, no matter what your set of circumstances, whether you're LGBTI, whether you're divorced and remarried … you're welcome.
“And if you're like us, a family with two heterosexual children and one homosexual son who's married to his husband, you're in, you're members of God's family, come along.”
However, the Meeting of World Families has moved from being a potentially inclusive event to an exclusive one, where her family no longer felt welcome, she says.
“Suddenly we were in the hands of a Church that is exclusive, that holds on to that book of laws and hits you over the head with it, uses it to exclude some and only include the chosen and I lost faith in it then …”
McAleese says she was “heartbroken for the children that I have, that can't go now, who feel they are not wanted because we feel not wanted … I think that's a pity because it could have been and still could be so great if they had got their message right.”
Speaking of women and the church, McAleese commented the current Pope is no different from any of his predecessors when it comes to gender equality within the church.
“He's a disappointment … he's made a few more appointments, but … you know they increased visibility, not voice.”
When it comes to the “issue of women in the Church,” this is where “the curial, magisterial Church is so far behind the curve it is embarrassing” and arguments against the ordination of women as priests were “ultimately untenable,” McAleese says.

Well before 20th Century Fox's Deadpool scored $783 million at the worldwide box office, fans were already asking if the Marvel Cinematic Universe had room for an R-rated superhero movie. The rating doesn't inherently mean much, but it would signal at least a more mature and hard-edged take on the superhero genre, and there are certainly a number of fans that would turn out for such a film. But Marvel Studios is ultimately owned by Disney, which does not make R-rated movies, so the prospect of an R-rated MCU movie seemed improbable at best.
Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige recently addressed the potential for an R-rated MCU movie for what feels like the 10th or 11th time with Allocine, and while he's definitely not confirming anything, he did leave some wiggle room should the occasion arise:
“I don't think it's out of the question. When I started at Marvel seventeen years ago, the Blade franchise was doing very well. A lot of people didn't even know that it was based on a Marvel character because at the time they sort of hid the fact it was Marvel. So, not out of the question, but not something we're working on right now,”
Again, Disney does not traditionally greenlight R-rated movies, and you have to go back to 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger to find an MCU movie that made less than $500 million worldwide. Basically, if it ain't broke don't fix it, and the MCU is far from broken—why risk alienating parents who see these movies as appropriate for almost all ages? From a creative standpoint I'd definitely be interested in seeing what an R-rated Marvel movie looks like, but at this point in time it doesn't make enough business sense for Disney to risk it. Moreover, it's not like the MCU is going to suddenly churn out a film as gritty, dramatic, and intimate-stakes oriented as Logan anytime soon—although an R-rated film on the scale of, say, Guardians of the Galaxy would be pretty neat.
But there is another R-rated superhero movie in the offing that has fans curious, and that's Venom. Sony Pictures owns the rights to the Spider-Man property and all of its characters, and while Sony and Marvel are currently in a deal that sees them sharing the character of Peter Parker, Sony is also moving ahead with Spider-Man movies of its own without Marvel's involvement—and that includes Venom.
When asked by Allocine if Venom might pop up in the MCU, Feige had this to say:
“For now, there is no plan for Venom in the MCU. It's a Sony Project.”
Would Feige and Marvel Studios love to have the Venom character in the MCU fold? No doubt. But Sony still maintains the rights to those characters and seems keen on forging that path on its own. They recently nabbed Tom Hardy to star in Venom with Ruben Fleischer (Gangster Squad) directing, and the R-rated film is intended to kick off Sony's “Marvel Universe”—which is a universe of Marvel Comics characters that Sony owns and Marvel Studios does not. Venom will be followed by the female-fronted Silver & Black, which has Gina Prince-Bythewood (Beyond the Lights) directing a team-up movie featuring Black Cat and Silver Sable.
If these plans don't work out it's possible Sony reaches across the aisle and brings Marvel into the fold on all of its Marvel Comics properties, but I doubt it. The Spider-Man relationship is beneficial to both parties in that Marvel Studios gets to use Parker in the MCU movies and Sony gets to use what will hopefully be positive clout from Spider-Man: Homecoming to get folks interested in Venom and Silver & Black, even though these movies won't technically be connected to Homecoming and certainly won't have the same Marvel Studios creative oversight.

A Hartcliffe man has been charged with grooming a teenage girl.
Philip Good, of Bishport Green, is accused of attempting to engage a girl aged between 13 and 15 years old in sexual activity.
The charge, announced on Monday December 11, comes after police arrested a 35-year-old man following a ‘sting operation' by a vigilante group the previous day.
The group approached a house in south Bristol while live-streaming a 40-minute exchange with an occupant on Facebook.
The group can be seen arguing with the man's relative at his home before he is arrested.
A spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said: “A 35-year-old Hartcliffe man has this evening been charged with a grooming offence.
“Philip Good, of Bishport Green, has been charged with attempting to cause or incite a girl aged 13 to 15 to engage in sexual activity.
“He was arrested yesterday afternoon.

“He has been remanded in custody ahead of his appearance at Bristol Magistrates Court.”
Good is due in court on tomorrow morning.

Game of Thrones has been weird this year. There are only seven episodes (five of which have now aired), it premiered in July rather than April because they needed to hold off on filming due to weather, and pretty much every episode is incredibly consequential. It's like watching a regular season on fast-forward and every scene is either a big reunion, big battle, or major death. There isn't even time for the characters to travel. In one scene, Jon Snow says he's going to Dragonstone, and in the next scene, he's in Dragonstone.
With all that's been happening, it's easy to feel a little lost, so be sure to catch up with these Game of Thrones articles we've been posting over the past few weeks. I'm sure my theory about Littlefinger being useless won't come back to bite me in the ass.

Stories about President Donald Trump secretly meeting with Vladimir Putin, or banning vaccinations, or refusing to send aid to a California disaster area were bound to draw a lot of readers and attention.
Readers of those stories in recent days have raised at least a couple of problems with them: 1) They're not true. 2) They're an ethically-challenged way to promote a Hollywood movie.
The fake news promotion of “A Cure for Wellness” — which became widely known on Monday — has created a small furor on social media and in conversations among film promotion experts. The aficionados mostly lambasted 20th Century Fox and Regency Enterprises for misleading consumers, in an attempt to boost ticket sales for the psychological thriller, which opens this weekend. Other marketing authorities said the sub-rosa campaign for the film succeeded because it drew lots of conversation in the days before its launch.
The two film companies acknowledged Monday that they hired a fake news creator to build websites and stories on a variety of subjects. Many were tied to Trump. Others were politically charged: citing a purported Utah bill to jail and publicly shame women who received abortions and referring to a “groundbreaking study” on the mental health challenges of liberals. The made-up stories had only oblique references to director Gore Verbinski's film.
Only after the fake news promotion had been written about by multiple news outlets, did the content on the fake news sites change. Then, only headlines for the fake stories appeared. Clicking on the headlines led readers to a website for “A Cure for Wellness.”
The film is a dark tale about a high-powered young executive who goes to Switzerland to recover his company's CEO from a health spa, only to be caught up in a mysterious treatment regimen that is far from benign.
A Fox spokesman said the studio would not discuss who came up with the publicity stunt, or any other details of the promotion. Regency, the production company founded by business magnate Arnon Milchan, also did not respond to requests for more information.
One veteran movie marketing official, who doesn't work for a rival studio, called the planting of fake news to sell a movie “monumentally stupid.”
“On moral level, I give it an F. On an execution level, I give it an F,” said the expert, who declined to be identified, out of fear of losing future business opportunities. “We don't need more fake news stories. We don't need more lies right now. There is already plenty of that out on the web. It's already hard enough for people.”
In a joint statement Monday, Fox and Regency suggested that the theme of fake news tied into the movie's exploration of a fake cure.
“‘A Cure for Wellness' is a movie about a ‘fake' cure that makes people sicker,” the statement said. “As part of this campaign, a ‘fake' wellness site healthandwellness.co was created and we partnered with a fake news creator to publish fake news. As our movie's antagonist says, ‘There is a sickness inside us. And only when we know what ails us, can we hope to find the cure.'”
But the movie marketing critic said that tie-in was far from obvious to the vast majority of those reading the fake news stories, which were republished or mentioned thousands of times on social media in recent days. “Those stories did not tie in — in any positive way — back to the movie,” said the critic.
Another marketing executive questioned why Fox and Regency would want to come anywhere close to the volatile issue of concocted news stories, a subject that is stirring anger and anxiety across the political spectrum since last year's presidential election.
“We now live in a time where things are really turbulent and movies really are about an escape and that to me is the false, difficult note here,” said the marketing executive, who also asked not to be named. “You are trying to relate your movie to a current event — which I get — but it's a current event that most people are trying to turn away from.”
Social media users generally gave the marketing subterfuge negative marks, too. “Tone deaf,” said one person on Twitter, where another added: “Sets a frightening precedent for Hollywood to manipulate.” A third said: “Boycott #CureForWellness for highly irresponsible creation of fake news in today's environment. Wait until it's free or bootlegged.”
Russell Schwartz, who teaches film marketing at Chapman College, was less critical of the “Cure” campaign, saying it appeared to have the desired effect of drawing attention to the film just before Friday's opening. But he, too, questioned the value of hitching the movie to such a volatile subject. “The fact they tied into so many sensitive issues right now, I think that might have been too great of a reach for them,” said Schwartz, who is also co-principal of Pandemic Marketing Group.
Another marketing veteran, who works for a Hollywood production company, said all the chatter about the “A Cure for Wellness” campaign made it a success, .
“If you can drum up this much attention in the week a movie is being released, I don't think that is a bad thing,” said the executive. “You want as much awareness and buzz as you can get.”
The booster did question the extent of the fake stories' attempts to hide their connection to “A Cure for Wellness.” “They were fooling people as long as possible, but people have to know this is about a movie,” said the executive. “When you are going to open in a few days, you have to sell some tickets.”
President Barack Obama will deliver a farewell address next week in his adopted hometown of Chicago, just 10 days before he hands over the Oval Office to President-elect Donald Trump. Formally announcing the event in an email to supporters Monday, Obama said that the speech, inspired by George Washington's farewell address in 1796, will both express gratitude and lay out a path forward, as Democrats attempt to recover from their electoral losses and mount an effective response to Trump's presidency. “I'm just beginning to write my remarks,” Obama wrote. “But I'm thinking about them as a chance to say thank you for this amazing journey, to celebrate the ways you've changed this country for the better these past eight years, and to offer some thoughts on where we all go from here.” The speech, likely his final public address as president, is scheduled for next Tuesday, Jan. 10, at McCormick Place, the city's main convention center and the site of his 2012 re-election victory rally. Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Obama waves to reporters at his end-of-year press conference in December. Next week, he will deliver what will likely be his final speech as president. The tradition of a farewell address dates back to Washington, who “set the precedent for a peaceful, democratic transfer of power,” Obama wrote. President George W. Bush gave his own farewell address five days before leaving office in 2009, celebrating “America's character” and giving his “best wishes to President-elect Obama, his wife Michelle, and their two beautiful girls.” On Sunday, Obama posted a series of tweets celebrating his administration's achievements, much of which will be jeopardized under the incoming Trump administration. As we look ahead to the future, I wanted to take a moment to look back on the remarkable progress that you made possible these past 8 years.— President Obama (@POTUS) January 1, 2017 Democrats are already preparing for a battle over the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans have repeatedly pledged to repeal. On Wednesday, Obama plans to meet with Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill to discuss strategy. But next week's speech will likely strike an optimistic and cordial tone. Obama has been fiercely committed to ensuring a peaceful transition of power, even as Trump has violated norms and set alarming precedents during the transition period. When asked about his concerns about Trump, Obama has mostly demurred. “Since 2009, we've faced our fair share of challenges, and come through them stronger,” Obama wrote on Monday. “That's because we have never let go of a belief that has guided us ever since our founding — our conviction that, together, we can change this country for the better.”

Tuesday is Tax Day, and millions of Americans are expected to file their 1040s as part of the complicated business of paying for government. Now is the time for President Trump to stop making excuses and release his own tax records to the public, as he should have done many months ago.
His current and complete tax returns, that is. And back taxes too, while he's at it. Two pages of Trump's 2005 forms that were leaked to the media last month showed he paid $38 million in taxes that year on more than $150 million in income. Because the documents were stamped “client copy,” it raised speculation that Trump or his emissaries had leaked the document to show that, at least for one year, he did pay federal taxes. Another leak, reported in the New York Times last year, suggested that Trump had taken a huge $916-million loss in the 1990s that enabled him to pay no federal taxes at all for an undetermined number of years.
Neither of those leaks is sufficient. Neither answers the most basic questions that Americans have about their new president. For instance: Does he have business entanglements overseas that might affect his foreign policy decisions? Does he owe money to Russian lenders? How much does he give to charity? Does the nation's convoluted tax system mean Trump pays taxes at a lower rate than middle-class Americans? In what years did he pay no taxes at all, and why? What other conflicts of interest exist that we can't even guess at?
Trump would like us to believe that his election victory means people don't care about his tax returns. But they do. A poll conducted in January found that nearly three-quarters of Americans want him to release his returns. On Saturday, tens of thousands of people marched in Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and dozens of other U.S. cities demanding that the president release his taxes.
Of course, he doesn't have to. Although it has become a tradition over the last four decades, there's no law requiring that presidents make public their tax forms. But Trump, whose finances are particularly complicated and whose potential conflicts of interests are far greater than most presidents — and who promised during the campaign that he would release his returns eventually — should do as other candidates and presidents have done. Especially with a major tax reform proposal on the way. How can the public trust the president's motives on a tax overhaul without knowing whether he will profit from it?

Merrymakers in their thousands massed along Scunthorpe High Street during mid-August 1945 to celebrate peace at the end of the Second World War.
There was open-air dancing through the night and fireworks to mark VJ (Victory over Japan) Day, on which many pubs ran out of beer, such was the demand.
It tells to Clement Attlee, Prime Minister for less than a month, to tell the British people that victory had been secured over Japan and that “the last of our enemies is laid low.”
The war in Europe had ended three months earlier with the German surrender and being marked by celebrations on VE Day.
Victory Joy Day Sweeps The World was the Scunthorpe Telegraph's front page headline on August 15, 1945.
The main story reported the national ramifications of victory achieved in the Far East.
A secondary story was headlined Scunthorpe Rejoices and said: “After midnight, reaction to the victory news, which provided a study in contrast, Scunthorpe began VJ Day this morning with a hustle.
“Shopping crowds invaded the town centre early, and there were long queues at the food shops.
“The same doubt about working hours which prevailed at first on VE Day was evident again today and many people turned up to the job.
“Night shift men at the steelworks received the news quietly, and went on a job. This morning, there was some confusion as to the holiday situation.
“Lysaght's have a stop week so there is no problem there.
“At Appleby-
Frodingham they were awaiting information as to a national arrangement which might be made in London, and men on morning and day shifts turned up as usual. This morning the plant was carrying on.
“At Redbourn they are planning a two-day holiday and this morning were working out charges in the furnaces in preparation for closing.”
The Telegraph reported a VJ Day hoax in Scunthorpe – targeting a number of unidentified pubs.
Someone put up signs early in the day promising “free beer at 10am.”
This resulted in long queues forming at one outlet.
Landlords rubbed out the hoax messages.
Several hundred people attended a morning service of thanksgiving outside the Youth Centre and collections were taken for the town's Welcome Home and Trust Fund for returning members of the forces.
Scunthorpe magistrates granted an application by Mr W T Lewis, on behalf of the Licensed Victuallers' Association, for a bar extension from 10.30pm to 11.30pm.
The Blue Bell Hotel had its dancing licence specially extended from 11pm to 1am.
Estimates suggested twice or even three times as many people went out to celebrate on VJ Day as did so on VE Day.
The Telegraph said: “At a very late hour, High Street, Doncaster Road and Cole Street were almost a solid mass of people with non-stop dancing outside the Baths Hall, the Savoy Theatre and on Market Hill.”
Brigg's VJ Day celebrations lasted until 1am.
They included a huge bonfire, fireworks and dancing in the floodlit Market Place, where hundreds of townsfolk and servicemen and women gathered.
He charges the taxpayer to rent his golf buggy from his own golf resort that he goes to to play golf instead of doing his job. He charges YOU to play golf??? And on top of that he cannot even claim it is his own tax dollars because he does not pay any bloody tax!

In Impromptus today, I hopscotch around as usual, or maybe more than usual: from the War on Terror to rebellious Russian teenagers to flipping the bird in church. (Yes, you can still do that in America, the land of the free, the home of the brave.) Along the way, I have an item on Charlottesville “truthers,” i.e., those who believe that the Charlottesville mess was staged by the Left in order to make the Right look bad. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher (R., Calif.) is such a truther, I note.
After I wrote my column, it came to light that another congressman, Paul Gosar (R., Ariz.), is such a truther too. He believes that George Soros pulled the strings.
One congressman looks like a fluke, but two looks like a pattern. I always resented a famous essay title, “The Paranoid Style in American Politics,” because I thought it maligned the Right. I have frequently pointed out the paranoid style on the left. The Left has owned this style through most of my life. These days, however, the Right is making Hofstadter (the essayist) look like a genius.
There is a lot you can fault Soros for. Maybe it should be stipulated he did not kidnap the Lindbergh baby? (He was one year old at the time, and living in Hungary. It is possible, true, that he had super-baby baby-kidnapping powers.)
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. intelligence official said on Sunday he would not be surprised if North Korea tested another missile, given that it had two tests in July, amid rising tensions between the United States and North Korea.
President Donald Trump has offered fiery warnings for North Korea, saying that the U.S. military was "locked and loaded". North Korean officials in turn have accused the U.S. leader of driving the Korean peninsula to the brink of nuclear war.
“I am quite confident that (North Korean leader Kim Jong-un) will continue to try to develop his missile program, so it wouldn't surprise me if there was another missile test," U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo said on "Fox News Sunday".
"He conducted two in July, so it wouldn't surprise me if there was another missile test."
North Korea said on Thursday plans would be completed by mid-August to fire four intermediate-range missiles to land near the U.S. Pacific island of Guam, 3,500 km (2,175 miles) away.
Guam, some 7,000 km from the U.S. mainland, is a target because of its naval base and air force base, from which two B-1B supersonic bombers were deployed close to the Korean peninsula on Tuesday.

Trump wrote on Twitter on Friday that U.S. "military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely".
Referring to Kim, Trump added: "If he utters one threat ... or if he does anything with respect to Guam or any place else that's an American territory or an American ally, he will truly regret it, and he will regret it fast."

Trump has urged China to apply more pressure on North Korea.
Trump is expected on Monday to launch a trade investigation into China.
White House officials have insisted the investigation is not designed to apply additional pressure on China as it relates to North Korea despite the president's previous remarks that he would be more amenable on trade if China stopped Pyongyang's nuclear program.
Trump has also insisted that "nobody loves a peaceful solution better than President Trump".
ISLAMABAD, Aug 14 (APP): On behalf of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary
Boris Johnson wish the people of Pakistan on the occasion of their
70th Independence Day.
Muhammad Jinnah's founding vision of a progressive, inclusive Pakistan
is still something worth cherishing and celebrating, and Pakistan should be rightly proud of its culture and history over the last 70 years, said a press release.
He said that the UK and Pakistan enjoy a close friendship thanks to
the links between our people particularly the 1.2 million British people who are of Pakistani origin.
Whether on the cricket field, at Pakistani celebrations in the UK or
through our strong education cooperation and support, the links between our two countries keep getting stronger, he added.
In 2017, the UK is celebrating these connections with a year-long
programma of cultural events, exhibitions and visits.
“As we celebrate our shared history together, and look forward to a
future with more links, more trade and more cooperation between the UK and Pakistan, I wish the people of Pakistan Jashan-e-Azaadi Mubarak.”
Throughout this year, the British High Commission has been hosting a
series of activities and events that celebrate the strength and depth of the UK-Pakistan relationship.
Already this year, there have been several high-profile visits from
the UK including Home Secretary Amber Rudd, the Secretary of State for International Development Priti Patel, Foreign Office minister Alok Sharma and The Lord Mayor of London Alderman Dr Andrew Parmley.
The British High Commission is conducting a photography exhibition
tour titled `Shared History. Shared Future.' which showcases 70 years of UK-Pakistan cooperation in pictures.
Most importantly the pictures focus on what the UK is doing with
Pakistan to help build for the next 70 years in education, health, culture, defence, politics, infrastructure, trade and sport.
The photography exhibition tour has already visited Peshawar,
Islamabad, Karachi & Quetta and will travel to over 10 other cities in the UK and Pakistan over the next few months.

Students and faculty gathered on Jan. 26 to discuss President Donald Trump's inauguration and recent executive actions.
Led by ASI Vice President of Student and University Affairs Christopher Morales, the conversation focused on policies, fears and the campus environment in a SBSB classroom.
Speakers advocated having civil conversations when disagreements occur, and talked about what actions going forward would be helpful.
“Because so much is still up in the air… it's still difficult to know what to advocate for and what to act [on]… so much is at stake,” Morales said,
During his campaign, Trump made many promises, including dissolving the Affordable Care Act, building a wall along the Mexico-US border to be paid by Mexico, and suggesting a “ban on all Muslims” and a lengthier vetting process for immigrants.
Morales said none of the recent Trump administration actions came as a surprise.
“This was the rhetoric that was followed throughout the campaign trail,” Morales said.
He said he does recognize students' fear of uncertainty. With the repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) being possible, the impact on campus would be real, he said.
Jasmine Dimagiba, a Political Science major, said she worried about fake news versus factual news and how difficult it is for some people to tell the difference.
Conversations have evolved from debating truths versus opinions into defending sources and who is more right, she said.
Stephen Nichols, chair of the Political Science Department, said he feels obligated as a college professor to stand by truth and reality, even if it makes Trump supporters uncomfortable. This does not mean he discourages differences in opinion, he said.
With the current administration, however, Nichols said he finds himself unable to defend its actions and due to its “inventing a reality that does not exist and creating policies that are to solve that non-existent reality's issues.”
Political Science professor Benjamin Nienass built upon Nichols' points: “The campus must strive to reflect on how we achieve inclusivity when inviting others into conversations.”
Neinass reminded students to not give up on “evidence based and critical thinking arguments.”
Although college campuses hold a reputation for being left-leaning, participants agreed that it wasn't a partisan issue to defend facts versus fiction.
“As we are the next generation of students who will be in that spotlight… regardless of our own opinions, we [should] still hold to fact-based evidence,” Morales said.
Press Release courtesy of Florida State Athletics
The (No. 23/20) Florida State swimming and diving teams are ready for a top 25 showdown on Saturday at 10 a.m. against Big Ten powerhouse (No. 17/21) Minnesota at the Morcom Aquatics Center.
“Saturday is going to be an awesome way to start the dual season,” FSU head coach Neal Studd said. “Minnesota always has a great team and coaching staff. They're consistently at the top of the Big Ten and one of the top programs in the nation with a lot of history. We're going to have our hands full, but I think we've got a lot going for us too. We're excited about the challenge. It's parent's weekend and our student-athletes are going to compete hard and we're also racing for ‘Paint it Pink,' which is another important cause to us. It's going to be a great meet.”
FSU vs. Minnesota
In the men's only meeting, the Seminoles edged out the Gophers in 2015-16 season on Oct.3, 158-42 behind a strong showing in both backstroke events in addition to the sprints. Also, the Seminoles went toe-to-toe on the boards and ultimately outscored the Gophers by one point on both 1-meter and 3-meter.
Minnesota leads the women's series 2-0 after falling 54-41 in Pullman, Wash. in 2000 and 212-88 at home in 2016.
The Meet
The teams will compete in the 16-event format, racing 100s and 200s of each stroke, the 1000, 500 and 50 free in addition to the 200 IM. The team will start the contest with the 200 medley relay and finish with the 200 free relay. Both 1-meter and 3-meter diving will run simultaneously to swimming.
Live timing will be available on sportstiming.com and via meet mobile.
The third ‘Paint it Pink' of 2017-18 will make its stop at the pool on Saturday. The Noles will support breast cancer awareness by wearing pink swim caps and pink shirts. Additionally, t-shirts will be available for a $10 donation and the proceeds benefit the Sharon Ewing Walker Breast Health Center at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital.
The Seminoles will also welcome their families for parent's weekend.
On the Noles
Florida State opens the dual season after finishing second at the Florida Invite on Sept. 22-24. Despite the early start to the season, the Seminoles turned in 11 victories including four women's relay wins. The Noles swept the ACC Performers of the Week as junior Kanoa Kaleoaloha and senior Alexi Smith won Swimmers of the Week while sophomore Ayla Bonniwell and senior Tyler Roberge were tabbed as the ACC Divers of the Week.
The women have caught the eyes of several watch lists after returning all of their individual point scorers from the NCAA Championships, including All-American and senior captain Natalie Pierce who finished fourth in the 100 breast (58.26). The Seminoles returned the ACC Diver of the Year, sophomore Molly Carlson as well as her classmate, Bonniwell who is the defending ACC champ on 1-meter.
The men's team produced the biggest jump in program history at the ACC Championships behind a fifth place finish in 2017 and will look to build on that success. Senior captain Chad Mylin will lead this season after his All-ACC, bronze medal-winning performance at the ACC Championships in the 50 free in addition to helping FSU place 11th in the 200 free relay at the NCAA Championships.
Florida State boats one of the deepest diving units in the country, returning NCAA qualifiers Roberge and sophomore Aidan Faminoff. Sophomore Cameron Thatcher brings his talents to Tallahassee after placing 15th on 3-meter at the 2017 NCAA Championships while representing Stanford and freshman Joshua Davidson looks to make a statement in his rookie season after closing his junior career with gold (3-meter) and silver (1-meter) at the 2017 Junior Pan American Games last week.
All told, the Seminoles return 48 student-athletes and welcome 34 newcomers for the 2017-18 season.
Noles in the Polls
The first College Swimming Coaches Association of America (CSCAA) poll was released on Oct. 4. The Florida State women's team made its debut at No. 23 while the men came in at No. 20.
The Seminoles will face three more ranked squads in October on the road. The women will visit Duke (No. 20), while the men will face Arizona State (No. 8) and Virginia Tech (No. 19). In addition, the Virginia Tech and Arizona State women each received votes.
On the Gophers
The contest in Tallahassee, Fla. marks the first for Minnesota this season. The women's team came in at No.17 in the first CSCAA poll, while the men are ranked 21st.
The women finished 2016-17 fourth in the Big Ten, 10th at NCAAs and had an 8-1 dual meet record. The Gophers return five All-American honorable mentions and the Big Ten Freshman of the Year – Tevyn Waddel (back, free).
The men's team was a perfect 9-0 in duals, also finished fourth at the Big Ten Championships before taking 23rd at the NCAA Championships. After graduating 14 student-athletes, the Gophers will look to 17 veterans and 17 newcomers to build on 2016-17.

LONDON (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday that Tehran will stand firm against U.S. threats to cut Iranian oil sales, and warned that Washington had not thought about the consequences of such a decision.
"The Americans say they want to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero. They have talked without thinking carefully. It shows they have not thought about its consequences," Rouhani was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA on an official visit to Vienna.

TWO-FACED ABOUT CLEAN CARS, FORD DISSES TESLA
When Elon Musk triumphantly took to Twitter to announce Tesla hit its quarterly production goals, he wrote: “7000 cars, 7 days ♥︎ Tesla Team ♥︎.” Quick to pour cold water on the celebration was Steve Armstrong, Ford's European boss. Armstrong replied to Musk on Twitter: “7000 cars, circa 4 hours. ♥︎ Ford Team ♥︎.” Ummm, defensive anyone?

Perhaps there's a reason legacy automakers like Ford are getting a bit prickly about the success of Tesla and the rise of electric vehicles. According to Jeremy Deaton (via CleanTechnica / Nexus Media), the “astonishing hypocrisy of Ford” and other legacy automakers is evident as they continue to tout electric cars while supporting efforts to weaken fuel economy standards.
On the one hand, “Ford plans to build 40 different models of electric vehicles by 2022.” On the other hand, Ford's former CEO was aggressively “arguing that consumers aren't interested in electric cars.” Companies like Ford and other legacy automakers “are talking out of both sides of their mouths.”
Deaton notes,”automakers are pouring money into electric vehicles, recognizing that strict limits on pollution will drive consumer demand for EVs overseas [in markets like China]. At the same time, car manufacturers are fighting similar policies in the United States on the grounds that limiting pollution won't allow them to keep up with consumer demand.”
Above: The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers works to weaken fuel efficiency standards — even as automakers develop new electric cars to be sold overseas (Youtube: Nexus Media News)
Looking back, “Ford and its trade association, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, wasted no time rushing to Washington after President Trump's election. They sent him and his transition team their deregulation wishlist, which included the clean car standards,” according to Madeline Page, clean cars program coordinator for Public Citizen.
And Ford isn't the only one. Other legacy automakers “have [also] fought to allow cars and trucks to pollute more…. Through their participation in the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, ostensibly climate-conscious car companies like Volvo, Volkswagen and Toyota have also pushed the Trump administration to ease limits on pollution and cast doubt on climate science.”
In a defensive blog post, Ford executives had insisted, “We support increasing clean car standards through 2025 and are not asking for a rollback.” At the time, advocates like Madeline Page weren't buying it.

“Ford touts a green image and has pledged support for climate programs. Its chairman, Bill Ford, proclaims climate change an urgent problem, and yet Ford is working with the Trump administration to undo the biggest protection program for climate on the books in this country,” Page said. “On the one hand, they love to earn media praise for making clean car announcements, while at the same time they're working to roll back the very standards that will actually ensure that we have clean air to breathe and a healthy climate for future generations.”
So how did this all unfold? Page turned out to be right. Efforts from Ford and the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers eventually prevailed. In April, it was reported that “The Trump Administration is cutting Obama-era fuel efficiency regulations.”
In response, Fred Krupp, President of the Environmental Defense Fund said, “No one in America is eager to buy a car that gets worse gas mileage and spews more pollution from its tailpipe.” Nevertheless, there is an automaker in America eager to sell them that car — and it's not Tesla.

Scientists have shown how an optical chip can simulate the motion of atoms within molecules at the quantum level, which could lead to better ways of creating chemicals for use as pharmaceuticals.
An optical chip uses light to process information, instead of electricity, and can operate as a quantum computing circuit when using single particles of light, known as photons. Data from the chip allows a frame-by-frame reconstruction of atomic motions to create a virtual movie of a molecule's quantum vibrations, which is what lies at the heart of the research published today in Nature.
These findings are the result of a collaboration between researchers at the University of Bristol, MIT, IUPUI, Nokia Bell Labs, and NTT. As well as paving the way for more efficient pharmaceutical developments, the research could prompt new methods of molecular modelling for industrial chemists.
When lasers were invented in the 1960s, experimental chemists had the idea of using them to break apart molecules. However, the vibrations within molecules rapidly redistribute the laser energy before the intended molecular bond is broken. Controlling the behaviour of molecules requires an understanding of how they vibrate at the quantum level. But modelling these dynamics requires massive computational power, beyond what we can expect from coming generations of supercomputers.
The Quantum Engineering and Technology Labs at Bristol have pioneered the use of optical chips, controlling single photons of light, as basic circuitry for quantum computers. Quantum computers are expected to be exponentially faster than conventional supercomputers at solving certain problems. Yet constructing a quantum computer is a highly challenging long-term goal.
As reported in Nature, the team demonstrated a new route to molecular modelling that could become an early application of photonic quantum technologies. The new methods exploit a similarity between the vibrations of atoms in molecules and photons of light in optical chips.
Bristol physicist Dr Anthony Laing, who led the project, explained: “We can think of the atoms in molecules as being connected by springs. Across the whole molecule, the connected atoms will collectively vibrate, like a complicated dance routine. At a quantum level, the energy of the dance goes up or down in well-defined levels, as if the beat of the music has moved up or down a notch. Each notch represents a quantum of vibration.
“Light also comes in quantised packets called photons. Mathematically, a quantum of light is like a quantum of molecular vibration. Using integrated chips, we can control the behaviour of photons very precisely. We can program a photonic chip to mimic the vibrations of a molecule.
“We program the chip, mapping its components to the structure of a particular molecule, say ammonia, then simulate how a particular vibrational pattern evolves over some time interval. By taking many time intervals, we essentially build up a movie of the molecular dynamics.”
First author Dr Chris Sparrow, who was a student on the project, spoke of the simulator's versatility: “The chip can be reprogrammed in a few seconds to simulate different molecules. In these experiments we simulated the dynamics of ammonia and a type of formaldehyde, and other more exotic molecules. We simulated a water molecule reaching thermal equilibrium with its environment, and energy transport in a protein fragment.
“In this type of simulation, because time is a controllable parameter, we can immediately jump to the most interesting points of the movie. Or play the simulation in slow motion. We can even rewind the simulation to understand the origins of a particular vibrational pattern.”
Joint first author, Dr Enrique Martín-Lopéz, now a Senior Researcher with Nokia Bell Labs, added: “We were also able to show how a machine learning algorithm can identify the type of vibration that best breaks apart an ammonia molecule. A key feature of the photonic simulator that enables this is its tracking of energy moving through the molecule, from one localised vibration to another. Developing these quantum simulation techniques further has clear industrial relevance.”
The photonic chip used in the experiments was fabricated by Japanese Telecoms company NTT.
Dr Laing explained the main directions for the future of the research: “Scaling up the simulators to a size where they can provide an advantage over conventional computing methods will likely require error correction or error mitigation techniques. And we want to further develop the sophistication of molecular model that we use as the program for the simulator. Part of this study was to demonstrate techniques that go beyond the standard harmonic approximation of molecular dynamics. We need to push these methods to increase the real-world accuracy of our models.
“This approach to quantum simulation uses analogies between photonics and molecular vibrations as a starting point. This gives us a head start in being able to implement interesting simulations. Building on this, we hope that we can realise quantum simulation and modelling tools that provide a practical advantage in the coming years.”
The timing of ICICI Bank's announcement to institute a probe ‘by an independent and credible person' into the Videocon-Kochhar case is somewhat intriguing. This should have come on day-one when the allegations were first brought to the Board's attention. The enquiry has been ordered two months after ICICI Bank's Board refuted allegations of any wrongdoings on the part of its CEO, Chanda Kochhar in connection with the Rs 3,250 crore Videocon loan case -- the Board reposed ‘full faith and confidence' in her even before conducting a detailed independent enquiry and refused to ask Kochhar to step down temporarily, till her innocence is proven without doubt.
“The Board of Directors, at its meeting held on 29 May, 2018, decided to institute an inquiry to be headed by an independent and credible person, to examine and enquire into an anonymous whistle blower complaint, disclosing certain information, alleging in substance that Bank's MD and CEO had not adhered to provisions relating to ‘Code of Conduct' of the bank and legal and regulatory provisions relating to ‘conflict of interest' over a period of time, as also alleging quid pro quo in the course of her work in dealing with certain customers/borrowers of the Bank,” the Bank wrote to the exchanges.
Remember, the decision to probe the charges against Kochhar came after market regulator, Sebi sent a notice to Kochhar a few days back on the bank's dealings with Videocon Group and NuPower Renewables, an entity in which her husband Deepak Kochhar has economic interests.
What does it tell us? The bank has been pushed to the corner by the regulator to conduct a probe; certainly not an encouraging example of good corporate governance practices that should be followed by large institutions.
Also, it is the same bank which said that the brother of a husband does not fall within the definition of a 'relative' under the Companies Act, 1956 or 2013 or the Rules thereunder. Hence there is no requirement of any disclosure of such a relationship by any official of the bank, ICICI added. That was a response given to a Firstpost query in connection with allegations that an advisory firm run by Rajiv Kochhar, the brother-in-law of Chanda Kochhar, was given the mandate to restructure foreign currency-denominated debt deals worth over $1.7 billion of seven companies over six years.
The seven companies were borrowers of ICICI Bank. Firstpost had sought clarity from ICICI Bank about its relation with Avista, against the backdrop of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) looking into the likelihood of a quid pro quo deal between the Kochhars and the Videocon group.
At the heart of the matter is a letter by activist shareholder Arvind Gupta to authorities in 2016 (Gupta wrote to all authorities including the PMO) arguing that for wrongful personal gains both parties (the Kochhars and Venugopal Dhoot) acted in a non-transparent manner with respect to certain financial transactions.
Gupta alleged that the Videocon group promoter Dhoot formed an equal joint venture - NuPower Renewables Pvt Ltd (NRPL) - with Deepak, invested Rs 64 crore in the JV and later transferred the entire stake to Kochhar. Gupta then linked those transactions to a 2012 loan worth Rs 3,250 crore from ICICI Bank to the Videocon group, and termed it a possible quid pro quo deal.
Indeed, the charges are serious in nature and, at the end of the day, Kochhar may or may not be found guilty in the whole affair. Only an independent probe can unravel the truth. But ICICI chose to stonewall an inquiry citing technical loopholes in the companies act, instead of adhering to the true essence of good corporate governance practices.
The golden rule -- a lender's first commitment is to its shareholders and depositors, and not individuals in the management -- was seemingly lost in the desperation to guard the management.
ICICI Bank's prolonged reluctance for a probe in the Videocon loan row, and its eagerness to protect the CEO despite concerns among the public and shareholders, has raised many questions about its corporate governance standards.
Yes, the bank has finally agreed for a probe, which is welcome, but it has come too late and appears more like an act of desperation, a move enacted to protect itself from the wrath of the regulator rather than an act of voluntary self- introspection.

New Delhi: After the GST Council addressed the liquidity concerns of exporters, the commerce and industry ministry plans to prepare a new export strategy to make overseas shipments a major driver of economic growth.
Exports contribute around 20% of India's gross domestic product.
At a four-hour consultation with export promotion councils, commerce and industry minister Suresh Prabhu gave a patient hearing to issues raised by them and asked them to submit a sector-wise time-bound plan to promote exports.
“We are working on short, medium and long-term strategies. There can be short-term challenges but the future belongs to India. While evolving strategies for integrating with global value chain, domestic issues will also be addressed simultaneously,” Prabhu posted on Twitter.
Commerce secretary Rita Teaotia said the department may have to revise down its goods and services export target of $900 billion by 2020 set in the foreign trade policy (FTP) because of the slow growth in exports in the initial years of the FTP.
The mid-term review of the FTP, which was supposedly on since Nirmala Sitharaman was the commerce minister, may not finally see the light of day.
“We don't want to wait for a magic day and will respond to challenges faced by exporters as and when they emerge. Whether a formal FTP review statement will be issued or not, commerce minister will take a final call,” Teaotia added.

The Biased Policing of Black Men
I have a son, Isaiah. He is graduating from high school in June and by all accounts it should be a happy occasion for our family. Yet, I know that it marks a turning point in how America sees my child. By virtue of nothing more than his skin color, he is a threat, a suspect, a target, a statistic waiting to happen. This reality was personified in the recently released video of Milwaukee Buck's guard Sterling Brown and his interaction with members of the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD).
During what should have been a simple citation incident in January of 2018, the video depicts MPD Officers intentionally escalating a situation that led to Mr. Brown being surrounded by six to eight officers, taken to the ground, tased, and arrested. False police reports were written that said he was aggressive and physically combative. Frustratingly, that image was allowed to circulate in the public for nearly four months, while the MPD withheld body cam video that clearly contradicts the report written by the officers.
In the meantime, and at taxpayer expense, MPD made their own PR commercial to preempt the release of the Brown video. They have stood in front of an African-American congregation and asked them to stand by the police department through the challenges that lie ahead regarding Brown's mistreatment.
The leadership of the MPD could have easily and quickly denounced the behavior and said, “this is not who we are”. Instead, former Chief of Police Ed Flynn, interim Chief Jim Harpole, and acting Chief Alfonso Morales chose not to swiftly to address the abuse of power that took place, but chose to protect the reputation of the police department. Even in finally holding a press conference, Morales' tactics were pitiful. There were no questions answered, no video released before the conference, and no information about the discipline of the officers involved. All we got was an “I'm sorry.”
Was anybody sorry for Derek Williams, Terrill Thomas and countless others who have been treated improperly by law enforcement? In a statement, Brown said “Situations like mine and worse happen every day in the black community…. “I am speaking for Dontre Hamilton of Milwaukee, Laquan McDonald of Chicago, Stephon Clark of Sacramento, Eric Garner of New York, and the list goes on.
These people aren't able to speak any more because of unjust actions by those who are supposed to “serve and protect” people.”
We need police officers capable of doing their jobs in a fair and unbiased way that honors their shield and respects the community that they serve. We need elected and appointed officials, at every level of government, to use the full weight of their positions to create transparent, impartial, and accountable policing.
Meanwhile, my son has had his indoctrination into the policing of African-Americans. At 16, Isaiah was placed in the back of a MPD squad car, while running to deliver a holiday turkey to a neighbor. So, like many parents, as I celebrate his graduation, I worry about his future.
ENGLISHTOWN, N.S.—A ferry that helps reduce the travel time to northern Cape Breton has been further delayed from reopening through much of the prime tourist season due to construction setbacks. The Department of Transportation said in April ice that flow damage in the narrow crossing meant a repair project that had aimed for a mid-April completion would be delayed until about June 15.

Marla MacInnis, a spokeswoman for the Transport Department, says that's now been further delayed until the end of August at least, due to further unspecified engineering challenges. The short crossing goes across St. Ann's Bay, about 60 kilometres east of Sydney, between Englishtown and Jersey Cove. When the ferry can't operate, it means motorists must take a winding, 24-kilometre drive around the bay to go from the Trans-Canada Highway to the Cabot Trail highway, which continues into the Cape Breton highlands.

Over the winter, the existing slip at the crossing site has been undermined more than anticipated and ice flow also slowed progress.

Lauren Conrad is celebrating the new year by announcing she's expecting a baby.
The 30-year-old former star of MTV's Laguna Beach and The Hills posted a picture of her sonogram on Instagram on Monday with the note, “I have a feeling 2017 is going to be the best year yet.”
This will be the first child for Conrad and her 36-year-old musician husband, William Tell. The couple married in 2014.
Since leaving TV, Conrad has worked as a fashion designer and launched a homeware line.

Malawi's First Lady, Professor Gertrude Mutharika has underscored the need for women across the country to go for cervical cancer screening.
The First Lady said this on Thursday in Neno where she engaged women from the area of Senior Chief Saimoni in cancer awareness as reports indicate that Malawi is registering high number of deaths due to cancer.
“Malawi is one the countries topping the list with high number of deaths due to cervical cancer as a result lack of awareness.
“It's saddening to note that Malawi as a country is losing a lot of women to cancer, and that a lot are still suffering as they never went for early cancer screening. Time has come for us to reduce these numbers,” said Mutharika.
She then encouraged women to consider taking their adolescent girls for screening as they too were at risk of having cervical cancer.
“Chiefs should also help us in organizing women in their respective villages to go for cancer screening,” she added.
On Cholera, Madame Mutharika emphasized on the need for people to follow proper health and hygiene practices.
“Following health and hygiene practices at household level is number one vaccine for cholera prevention hence the need for all of us to make sure that we exercise it,” advised Mutharika.
During the awareness meeting, health experts from Neno District Health Office addressed the gathering on Cholera management, esophagus, breast and cervical cancer.
The people were told on the causes, signs and symptoms as well as the kind of assistance those infected can get from the hospital.
Member of Parliament for the area, Mary Khembo hailed the First Lady for finding time out of her busy schedule to come and conduct the awareness meeting noting that the women had learnt a lot.
The First Lady then presented hampers containing assorted items to 200 elderly persons from the area of Traditional Authority Saimoni.

The first trailer for A24's "The Florida Project" has arrived, launching a potential awards campaign for what industry watchers are already calling this year's "Moonlight," an American indie and Cannes darling that marks the latest film from Sean Baker ("Prince of Broadway," "Starlet").
Two years ago, Baker's iPhone-shot "Tangerine" made a splash with its vérité odyssey across Los Angeles, as seen through the eyes of a transgender woman named Sin-Dee (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez). Like "Tangerine," "The Florida Project" takes an intimate tour through a marginalized existence rarely seen in film, even if its subjects might more closely resemble the characters of Andrea Arnold's "American Honey" than Barry Jenkins' best-picture winner "Moonlight" (both also released by distributor A24).
The story is set in Florida in the shadows of Disney World, where 6-year-old Moonee (Baker discovery Brooklynn Prince) lives with her young mother, Halley (Bria Vinaite), in a brightly painted budget motel run by Bobby (Willem Dafoe).
"The Florida Project" emerged from this year's Cannes lineup as a major entry to watch come Oscar season and solidified Baker's reputation as one of the most exciting new American auteurs on the rise. The Times' critic Justin Chang named it "the most thrillingly alive" film of the festival. (Read his review here and meet the film's precocious young stars here.)
Shot on 35 millimeter by cinematographer Alexis Zabe (“Silent Light,” “Post Tenebras Lux”), the ode to childhood and finding magic where you make it opens in theaters Oct. 6. Watch the trailer here:
There's an experiment underway at a few top universities around the world to make some master's degrees out there more affordable.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for example, says the class of 2018 can get a master's degree in supply chain management for more than $20,000 off from the university's normal price, which runs upwards of $67,000 for the current year academic year.
But it's not as simple as sending in a coupon with your tuition bill.
It's called a "MicroMasters." MIT, Columbia University, the University of Michigan and the Rochester Institute of Technology are among a dozen or so universities globally that are giving this online program a shot.
It's not a full degree, but a sort of certificate, and can be a step toward a degree.
There are things in it for students, and for the school.
What's in it for students: cost
Let's take Danaka Porter as an example. She's a 31-year-old business consultant from Vancouver, British Columbia, and says a master's degree was exactly what she needed to boost her career.
"I found that people were a little bit more respected, I guess, once they had their master's because it was like they had taken that next step to go a little bit further," she says.
But she couldn't afford to stop working and become a full-time student again. She owns a house, she says, and "I have bills, and all of that stuff that doesn't stop because I wanted to go to school."
When a friend told that MIT was piloting its first partially online master's degree in supply chain management, she signed up.
The tuition for a year in the master's of supply chain management costs $67,938. Her MicroMasters certification, though, is just $1,350.
It's called a MicroMasters because it isn't a full degree, just a step toward one, though Porter says the coursework is just as rigorous as if she were on MIT's campus in Cambridge.
"It requires a lot of effort and if you don't have a background in math, engineering or supply chain it's not a breeze. Like, we do have people that fail," she says.
Even if she passes the certification, Porter will still need to complete a semester "in residence" at full cost if she wants to finish her graduate degree. It's part of what MIT calls the "blended" program — online and on-campus.
Getting accepted is no easy task. MIT says it expects to admit 40 students a year into the blended program.
Some top schools from around the world are on board with MIT.
There's user experience research and design from the University of Michigan; entrepreneurship from the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore; and artificial intelligence from Columbia University, among others.
Even if students don't go for a full master's, the online course work can make them more appealing to employers.
Industry leaders who say they can't find enough qualified candidates are looking for very specific skills like the ones being taught. GE, Walmart, IBM and Volvo have recognized MicroMasters and are encouraging their employees and job applicants to take these courses.
Some students who are enrolled in MIT's on-campus program wish these online courses had been available to them before spending big on their degrees.
"If this was an option, I think I would have considered it," says Veronica Stolear, a graduate student at MIT from Caracas, Venezuela. She quit her job in the oil industry to earn her master's in supply chain management. Ultimately, though, she thinks her on-campus experience will pay off.
"The in-campus program is more expensive, but you're getting also the experience of living in Boston, interacting with people from MIT that might not be in supply chain but might be in like the business school and like other types of departments," she says.
What's in it for schools: getting the best applicants
You might be wondering what MIT gets out this arrangement.
Admission officers here say they'll weigh applicants' performance in these online courses.
Anant Agarwal, an MIT professor and CEO of the online-learning platform edX that makes these online courses possible, sees it all as a way to filter the applicant pool.
"When you get applications from people all over the world, it's often a crap-shoot," he says. "You don't know the veracity of the recommendation letters or the grades. And so you're taking a bet very often."
And Agarwal says that should give MIT and other institutions a better sense of how students will perform — if they're lucky enough to get in.

Talking to APP,he said that surveillance had been lengthened in MCR areas .
He said that spread of dengue is under control and only one dengue positive case was reported in Rawalpindi cantt area but there was need to create awareness among the people to keep their houses clean and leave no place wet or with stagnant water.
He warned that stern action would be taken against the staff deputed in the campaign, if they show any negligence in performance of their duties.—APP
But Toronto (0-2) finds itself at a crossroads already this season. The defending Grey Cup champions have yet to establish an identity, having struggled to mount any sort of consistency.
And now, they must try to surge ahead without their offensive leader.
The challenge for Toronto defensively will be containing Reilly, who was 22-of-30 passing for 326 yards and three TDs in rallying Edmonton (2-1) past B.C. 41-22 last week. The Lions led 11-2 heading into the second quarter but were outscored 29-3 over the second and third.
But Reilly was hardly a one-man show. Running back C.J. Gable ran for 165 yards and a TD on 23 carries while D'haquille Williams had six catches for 129 yards and a touchdown as Edmonton's offence rolled up 517 total yards.
Prediction: Edmonton.
Hamilton Tiger-Cats vs. Saskatchewan Roughriders
Thursday 9 p.m.
At Regina, Jeremiah Masoli chases a record-tying ninth straight 300-yard passing effort for Hamilton (2-1) after throwing for 369 yards and a TD in last week's 31-17 home win over Winnipeg. Saskatchewan quarterback David Watford replaced Canadian Brandon Bridge to open the second half of last week's 23-17 home loss to Montreal, but the Roughriders (1-2) have said they're going back to Bridge against Hamilton. The Als targeted Duron Carter, who had trouble covering speedy Chris Williams (three catches 130 yards, TD).
Prediction: Hamilton.
Ottawa Redblacks vs. Montreal Alouettes
Friday 7:30 p.m.
At Montreal, the Alouettes (1-2) look to build off last week's win over Saskatchewan that snapped their miserable 13-game losing streak. Jeff Mathews was 8-of-12 passing for 98 yards in relief of Drew Willy (concussion protocol). Trevor Harris completed 13-of-29 passes for 135 yards and a pick for Ottawa (1-1) in last week's 24-14 road loss to Calgary. William Powell ran for 123 yards while Greg Ellingson had six catches for 97 yards and a TD.
Prediction: Ottawa.
B.C. Lions vs. Winnipeg Blue Bombers
Saturday 8:30 p.m.
At Winnipeg, the Blue Bombers (1-2) continue to chase their first home win of the season. Rookie Chris Streveler finished 17-of-28 passing for 146 yards and no TDs — for the first time in three starts — last week against Hamilton. Veteran starter Matt Nichols has been removed from the six-game injured list, so he could be back behind centre soon. B.C. (1-1) started out well enough against Edmonton but couldn't make it stick as quarterback Jonathon Jennings finished 13-of-24 passing for 199 yards with an interception while rushing for 34 yards on five carries.
Prediction: Winnipeg.
Last week: 3-1
Overall: 8-4

Like many boys, Sunny Odogwu got a flat top growing up. His came as the result of steadying massive bowls of water atop his head during walks from his small Nigerian village to the nearest stream.
He's not exactly sure how far it was, but compared the distance to traveling from Westwood to Culver City, which is several miles.
The bowls were so heavy that they compressed the top of his head, and he lost sensitivity.
“I can actually pull hair off here,” Odogwu said, yanking out a few strands, “and not feel it.”
Odogwu was selling the water one day when a man approached and asked if he played basketball. No, Odogwu told him, he played soccer. The man wouldn't relent, buying the teenager his first pair of basketball shoes and shorts. He showed him how to play the game and helped him attend a basketball camp for prospects, the best of whom could go on to the United States.
“From there,” Odogwu said, “everything just took place.”
It was the start of a journey so unlikely that Odogwu likened it to “a waterfall that is going uphill.” He joined UCLA's football team this summer as a graduate transfer after shuffling through three sports and six schools. And he could be the starting right tackle on an offensive line in need of size and spunk after being pushed around for most of last season.
Odogwu, who is 6 feet 7 and 315 pounds, provides both. He once told reporters covering the Miami (Fla.) football team that he didn't speak English, before breaking into a wide smile. He cracked up UCLA coach Jim Mora by asking him to play “Cotton-Eyed Joe” during a team meeting because it was the first song he heard after arriving in America.
Each time Odogwu speaks, he punctuates his words with a laugh or a smile, sometimes both. He said he earned his given name as an “oops baby” — the last of eight siblings — who brought sunshine to the family.
“Just his attitude, his personality is infectious,” Mora said. “The guys love him and I think he's really going to help us this year.”
Odogwu used to run up a 70-foot man-made hill in South Florida while training for the Hurricanes during his first four years of college. The payoff was a view of surrounding ritzy neighborhoods that couldn't have been any more different than the village of Ezeagu where he grew up.
There was no electricity or running water back home, where Odogwu lived in a hut made of straw and cinder blocks. He slept on a flimsy mat to prevent bugs and other creatures from biting him, pulling a mesh fabric over his body to keep away the mosquitoes. His departure for the United States at 16 was bittersweet, Odogwu leaving behind a family grieving the death of his father in hopes of a better life for himself and those he loved.

Just his attitude, his personality is infectious. The guys love him and I think he's really going to help us this year. — UCLA Coach Jim Mora
He enrolled at Village Christian Academy in Conyers, Ga., because of a connection with the school's basketball coach who had seen him play on a recruiting trip to Africa. It was the first time Odogwu had slept on a bed, but it wasn't exactly a peaceful slumber.
“When I fell asleep, I thought I was flying,” Odogwu recalled. “I kept waking up thinking I was still in Africa . . . but I wasn't because I was lying on the beautiful bed.”
Odogwu liked to go into the bathroom and repeatedly turn the faucet on and off, delighting in what he called “magic water.” He left after his sophomore year for basketball power Huntington (W.Va.) Prep, where his coach and host family quickly decided he was better suited for football because of his size and ferociousness.
“He just ran over you,” said Rob Fulford, the Huntington Prep basketball coach who is now an assistant at Akron. “I would have to say the drop-step-and-get-out-of-my-way was his favorite move.”
Everyone agreed it was time to find another sport.
Scott Thomas, whose family housed Odogwu in West Virginia, took him to a high school football game to formally introduce him to the sport. When a fight broke out on the field, Odogwu stood up and prepared to jump the fence and join the fray, Thomas holding him back. Odogwu explained that it was custom in Nigeria for spectators to participate in fights on the field.
Odogwu was equally uninhibited when it came to eating. Thomas would buy three-pound clusters of bananas only to find them gone by the time he completed the 10-minute drive from home to basketball practice. Jars of peanut butter were also endangered species.
“Whatever he could put with it — bread, crackers, it didn't matter — he would just eat peanut butter all day,” Thomas said.
Odogwu's switch from basketball to football necessitated another transfer because Huntington Prep didn't have a football team. So he enrolled at St. Frances Academy in Baltimore, where he played offensive tackle and also put his soccer skills to use as a reserve kicker who handled a few extra-point conversions and punts. He was so raw that it was decided a postgraduate season at Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham, Va., was necessary to enhance his technique before college.
Miami won a recruiting battle that also involved Texas Tech, Mississippi State and West Virginia. Odogwu redshirted his first season before making his debut on special teams and along the offensive line. He scored a touchdown against Duke in November 2015 when he pounced on a fumble in the end zone.

But injuries limited Odogwu to 14 starts in three seasons and have prompted the Bruins to closely manage his practice workload. He sustained a torn knee ligament during Miami's final regular-season game of 2015 and missed the final eight games of last season after hurting his ankle. He called Thomas' wife, Lesley, in tears after sustaining the latter injury.
“I said, ‘Sunny, God has a plan for you,'” Lesley recalled, “‘and you just have to trust it.'”
That plan has led Odogwu to Los Angeles for his final season of college eligibility despite a recruiting pitch to play at Marshall from the woman whom he calls his “American momma.”
“We tried to get him back home with us but he was like, ‘Mom, Marshall … UCLA?'” Lesley Thomas said of their conversation while Odogwu was weighing his options. “‘Uh, I think I'm coming to UCLA.'”
Odogwu struggles to articulate his decision, saying only that it involved lots of prayer.
“Leaving was the hardest thing I had to do, but the transition was just something that I could not explain,” Odogwu said. “It came beyond me. I believe it was God's call for me to come here.”
He's working toward a master's degree in social sciences and said he's also only three classes short of completing a master's in arts and international administration from Miami. However, Odogwu's most recent studies have involved the nuances of the UCLA playbook.
Hank Fraley, the Bruins' offensive line coach, called Odogwu a perfectionist whose size forced the team to “rearrange some stuff” inside a meeting room, but his roommate found him to be a surprisingly picky eater.

“He doesn't like sweets, which is kind of funny for an offensive lineman,” guard Andre James said. “He doesn't like to eat bad things.”
Odogwu has consumed enough that the family he left behind almost nine years ago barely recognizes him.
“They've seen my picture and they're like, ‘. . . What are you?'” said Odogwu, who will turn 25 in January. “I'm like, ‘I'm your little brother, the one that left a long time ago.'”
He intends to return, using his degrees to help others just like the mysterious man who discovered him and then disappeared, never to be seen again.
“It's difficult but it's not because it's a journey and I believe God is taking me somewhere,” Odogwu said. “When I get there, I'll be able to see them whenever I want to, to take care of my mom, which is the most important thing in my life right now, and take care of my siblings and everybody else.”

Jammu and Kashmir capital Srinagar saw the first heavy snowfall of the season. The advent of snow in Srinagar led to fall in mercury level across north India, intensifying the cold conditions.
According to the Met department, Western disturbances have triggered snowfall in the Kashmir Valley. Meanwhile, Pir Panjal range in J&K continued to receive snowfall forcing the authorities to close the Mughal road for traffic. Residents used bonfire in order to battle cold wave conditions in J&K's Rajouri sector.
A month-long dry spell in Jammu and Kashmir ended with the Valley receiving fresh snowfall while the plains were lashed by heavy rain, leading to a rise in minimum temperature at most places across the Ladakh region.
Gulmarg, the famous ski-resort in north Kashmir, recorded 15 cm (about six inches) of fresh snowfall till 8:30 am on Monday morning. Light snowfall was also recorded at the other famous health resort of Pahalgam in south Kashmir.
Residents in Srinagar were pleasantly surprised to see a thin blanket of snow covering the landscape in the morning.
“This is Kashmir. Without snow the landscape looks orphaned. If the government is able to provide basic amenities to the people, winter is undoubtedly the best season in Kashmir,” said Nisar Hussain, a retired chief engineer who lives in Gogjibagh.
The weather office said the minimum temperature was minus 0.2 in Srinagar and 0.1 in Pahalgam. While Gulmarg at minus 6.5 was the coldest place in the state on Tuesday, the Met said.
Freeland baseball outpitched twice by Swan Valley
FREELAND -- Freeland came up on the short end of a pair of well-pitched games Tuesday, losing 4-2 and 6-3 to visiting Swan Valley in Tri-Valley Conference Central baseball.
The Falcons drop to 6-4 overall and 2-2 in the conference.
In the opener, Freeland sophomore pitcher Tyler McLaren went six scoreless innings until the Vikings struck for four runs in the top of the seventh to turn a 1-0 deficit into a 4-1 lead.
"He pitched a gem," FHS coach Pete Duley said of McLaren. "He was going up against Swan Valley's Avery Goldensoph, and it was freshman against sophomore. They both pitched outstanding. It was a well-played high school baseball game."
The Falcons scored a run in the bottom of the seventh to cut it to 4-2 and had runners at second and third but couldn't drive them in.
"That freshman -- he was on," Duley said of Goldensoph. " ... It was a great game, a tough one to lose."
McLaren worked 6 2/3 innings and struck out eight in a losing effort.
Freeland managed only four hits off of Goldensoph, including two singles by Carston Yaw.
In the nightcap, the Vikings scored four runs in two innings off of FHS starter Ben Fleming before Fleming left the game due to a sore arm. Garhet Metiva pitched the final five innings and surrendered only two runs.
Freeland managed only two hits, singles by Fleming and Elijah Vlassis.
"We just couldn't really get anything going (offensively)," said Duley. " ... Mainly, we got on by walks and errors."
The Falcons are off until next Tuesday when they'll head to Chesaning.
When the Obama Administration changed the guidelines for sentencing drug offenders for crack cocaine, it opened up a number of cases to be reduced, allowing some offenders to appeal their cases and be released early. Matthew Charles, a resident of Nashville, Tennessee had originally served 21 years of a 35-year sentence for selling crack cocaine to an undercover informant in 1996. He was later released, allowed to restart his life and become a model citizen.
Now he has to go back to prison after the US Attorney's office appealed the ruling, calling him a “career offender.”
“The whole thing pisses me off to be honest,” Charles' friend John Hairston told Nashville Public Radio. “But it underscores how big a need there is for some reform in the justice system. I don't care what they say.”
Since his release, Charles studied to get a GED and became a law clerk who helped other inmates understand their cases long after the public defender system had discarded them. Since his release he has held a job, volunteered in the community, build relationships with his family and girlfriend. Even while he was in prison, he never had a disciplinary infraction, not one. He even organized bible study courses and helped inmates who were illiterate with their own cases to help them from feeling embarrassed or ridiculed.
What a shame.

Blur are the days, fog prevails
Summer frazzled people, they pale
As scorched the Sun awfully
Though now mounted the ecstasy
Cozing up by snuggling fire
Pausing up the summerly ires
Freshning the moods, partake affection
Emancipates from blazing afflictions
All the winter tidings speak loud
As they freshen , heart feel proud
Cups of tea coupling the dry fruits
Unbossoming possibly all winter routes
Covering cold with warm attires
Reveals winter stories in entire
Let it rain
Let the rain kiss you
Let the rain beat upon your head with silver liquid drops
Let the rain sing you a lullaby
The rain makes still pools on the sidewalk
The rain makes running pools in the gutter
The rain plays a little sleep song on our roof at night
And I love the rain

Presaging contended new year
So, keep up folks have cheers
Divinity serene our country land

This event means a lot to us and CIASA is always happy to support Mr Flowers and all of his efforts and it is great to see that this has grown from 50 swimmers to 1,000 in 25 years. And here's to bigger and better things to come.” Race registration proceeds will be donated to the local cancer society.
Swimming NSW President Honored with OAM…..Graham Towle of North Rocks, New South Wales Australia, has been awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for his services to swimming for more than 30 years. He was elected to the Swimming NSW Board in 2009 and now serves as President of Swimming NSW. “I'm quite humbled,” he said. “There are a lot of people who I see every week that are worthy of this honour as well. “Volunteering has been very rewarding.”

No Spectator Fees For Swimming Victoria Events…..The Board of Swimming Victoria announced that spectator fees for all Swimming Victoria events, including the 2017 Victorian Age Championships, have been eliminated for the 2017-18 season. SV President Paul Malcolm, says, “We're committed to help families manage the cost of swimming and encouraging parents and friends to stay involved in the sport. And with it costing up to $72 for two parents to see their child compete at the Victorian Age Championships, we understand that can be a barrier.
“We're delighted to now be able to waive these entry costs for spectators, due to increased membership and participation, and we hope that will result in a lot more families and friends cheering their swimmers on from the stands.”
There will be 2,400 athletes, 400 coaches, and countless supporters in Langley this weekend.

The best of the best high school track and field athletes from throughout the province are converging on Langley this week.
Langley, and specifically the McLeod Athletic Park (MAP), are a preferred location for the BC High School Track and Field (BCTF) Championships that are happening Thursday through Saturday.
While the local track and most of its competition amenities are pretty standard, it's the covered stadium and media booth used for staging, as well as the jumbotron that keep organizer Andrew Lenton and the team from the BCTF's commission coming back to Langley again and again.
“The media tower makes a great staging area for the event, for us, from an organizational perspective,” he said.
“But the feedback we get from the spectators is that the jumbotron is something they're really wanting to keep, so we've come back here.”
He said the Township's parks and rec staff have been “great to deal with.” And the commission's long-standing relationship with the Langley Mustangs track and field club has made it possible to facilitate “an event of this magnitude” year after year.
“It's a really great facility. The Township of Langley is great to work with, their parks and rec. The facilities are great,” said Lenton, who is assistant coach at Maple Ridge Secondary and commissioner for the B.C. High School Track & Field Commission.
In addition to complimenting parks and rec, he said partnering with the Langley Mustangs track and field club to facilitate an event of this magnitude has been key.
“It's just a massive event,” Lenton said Wednesday afternoon from MAP.
It's one of the largest high school competitions of any kind in the country, comparable only to the Ontario track and field event, he said.
It will be a full house, added Lenton, noting that once again there will be 2,400 students from 335 high school throughout the province competing.
“We cap out. We limit and restrict who can come into the championships,” he explained. “There are many thousands and thousands more who have not been as lucky as to qualify or get a berth into the championships.”
In addition to all the athletes expected, there are another 400 coaches, and countless parents and supporters coming to Langley this weekend.
“This is a huge undertaking,” Lenton told the Langley Advance, explaining that these annual championships takes more than a year of prep time to arrange.
Speaking to that, he and the other commission directors started preparing for 2019's competition last summer.
The championships are primarily held within the Lower Mainland, because of facilities and logistics.
Only on rare occasions does it get moved to the Island or Interior.
It was hosted at the Apple Bowl in Kelowna in 1972, and Nanaimo in 2015, Lenton recalled. But he confirmed it will be back in Kelowna again next year, and he's already making plans for their return to Langley in 2020.
This is year six for Lenton at the helm.
“I thought I would do it for one year, and somehow I'm finding myself in year six. I don't know how that happened,” he said.
It's primarily the calibre of athletes he sees participating year after year, and their insatiable quest to better themselves, that keeps him coming back.
This year's competition includes 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1,500-metre races, long jump, shot put, high jump, javelin, triple jump, steeplechase, race walking, discus, and hammer for students Grade 8 through 12.
“This really is, in terms of high school track and field competition, as good as it gets,” he said.
“In fact, We have some of the best athletes in the world competing,” he added, encouraging sports enthusiasts to watch the performances.
“They're going to be exciting,” Lenton said of the various showdowns. “For a lot of the kids, this is what they've been practicing and training for months and months.”
While Thursday's action runs from 3 to about 8 p.m., Friday and Saturday are full days. Friday will see meets and competitions running from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. and Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to about 5 p.m.
That's long days, Lenton admitted. But to make it more palatable for spectators, most of the finals have been arranged between about 2 and 5 p.m. on both Friday and Saturday.
“We've loaded in all the finals in those times,” or at least as many as they could accommodate.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - London-listed drugmaker Shire Plc said on Tuesday it was willing to recommend to its shareholders a deal with Takeda Pharmaceutical Co, after the Japanese company sweetened its acquisition offer to 46 billion pounds ($64 billion).
FILE PHOTO: Vitamins made by Shire are displayed at a chemist's in northwest London, Britain, July 11, 2014. REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/File Photo
The development, first reported by Reuters earlier on Tuesday, represents a major breakthrough for the companies in their negotiations, following a pursuit that started on March 28 when Takeda said it was considering a bid for Shire. Since then, Takeda has made five offers, the latest earlier on Tuesday.
Shire said in a statement it had agreed to extend a Wednesday regulatory deadline for the deal talks to conclude to May 8 in order to allow Takeda to carry out more due diligence and firm up its bid. Shire added that the deadline could be extended further, if needed.
Any deal between the two companies is still subject to the resolution of several issues, including completion of due diligence by Shire on Takeda, Shire said.
Takeda added in its own statement that it intended to maintain its dividend policy and investment-grade credit rating following the deal.
Shire focuses on treatments for rare diseases and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The acquisition would be the largest ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company and propel Takeda, led by Frenchman Christophe Weber, into the top ranks of global drugmakers.
It would significantly boost Takeda's position in gastrointestinal disorders, neuroscience, and rare diseases, including a blockbuster hemophilia franchise.
But the transaction would be a huge financial stretch, since Shire is worth considerably more than the Japanese group. Ambitious cost cutting will be required to make the deal pay.
Dealmaking has surged in the drug industry this year as large players look for promising assets to improve their pipelines. A Takeda-Shire transaction would be by far the biggest. Shire has long been seen as a likely takeover target and was nearly bought by U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc in 2014, until U.S. tax rule changes caused the deal to fall apart. Shire also has a track record of acquisitions, but its biggest ever deal - the $32 billion purchase of Baxalta in 2016 - was widely criticized by shareholders.
Dublin-based Shire, a member of Britain's benchmark FTSE 100 stock index, said Takeda's fifth offer was worth 49.01 pounds per share, comprised of the equivalent of 27.26 pounds per share in new Takeda shares and 21.75 pounds per share in cash. Under these terms, Shire shareholders would own half of the combined company.
ALLERGAN BOWED OUT
Allergan Plc, the U.S. maker of Botox, had been considering a rival bid for Shire but ruled itself out of making an offer last week.
Shire also announced last week it was selling its oncology business to unlisted French drugmaker Servier for $2.4 billion.
Takeda's shares closed down 1.5 percent on Tuesday, giving it a market value of 3.86 trillion yen ($35.5 billion), according to Thomson Reuters data.
Takeda investors have been skeptical about the merits of a Shire deal, given the size of the potential purchase and the likely need for a large share issue, which could be highly dilutive.
Weber was promoted to CEO in 2015, becoming the drugmaker's first non-Japanese boss.
Shire traces its roots back to 1986, when it began as a seller of calcium supplements to treat osteoporosis, operating from an office above a shop in Hampshire. Since then it has grown rapidly through acquisitions to generate revenues of about $15.2 billion last year.

PITTSBURGH >> The Pittsburgh Penguins Stanley Cup championship, the first an NHL team has won back to back in almost 20 years, spawned by far the biggest victory parade of any of the franchises five titles.
An estimated 650,000 people turned out along a downtown parade route that ended with a rally at Point State Park, city public works and public safety officials said Wednesday. A sunny day with temperatures in the 80s didnt hurt, as the smell of sunscreen was as pungent as the Penguins love in a city that boasts, officially, only 305,000 residents.
These guys are fierce competitors, coach Mike Sullivan told the crowd from a stage in the triangular park formed by the confluence of the citys three rivers. They just know how to win.
Roughly 400,000 fans attended last years celebration, which was the biggest for any of the teams Stanley Cup championships to that point.

The Penguins won the cup Sunday against the Nashville Predators with a 2-0 win in Game 6. And judging from signs and chants from the crowd, this championship was sweetened by the adversity the team overcame.
Playoff MVP and Penguins captain Sidney Crosby was knocked out for the better part of two games with a concussion against the Washington Capitals, and the Penguins played without their best defenseman, Kris Letang, who had neck surgery before the playoffs.
As the players took the stage to PPG Paints Arena announcer Ryan Mills introductions, fans also learned that Ian Cole, another defenseman, played through a broken hand and broken ribs. And Brian Bonino, who broke his leg blocking a shot but still finished Game 2 of the finals before missing the rest, hobbled around on crutches while taking selfies with fans.
A couple of bittersweet story lines punctuated the festivities: 40-year-old veteran Matt Cullen, who has won two Cups since joining the Penguins as a free agent last season, has hinted he might retire, prompting fans to chant, One more year! And, perhaps the best story of the playoffs was how former starting goalie Marc-Andre Fleury regained that job when rookie Matt Murray was injured during warm-ups in the first game of the playoffs. Fleury was in net for nine of the 16 victories the Penguins needed to win the Cup before Murray returned from injury to replace Fleury after a shaky third-round game against Ottawa and was in net for Pittsburghs final seven playoff wins.
Fleury, one of the most popular Penguins with fans and teammates, is likely to leave when the new Las Vegas franchise drafts its players or in an offseason trade.
Phil Kessel, another fan favorite since the Penguins acquired him from Toronto two seasons ago, drew some of the biggest cheers.
Fan Kristen Pearce, of Green Bay, Wisconsin, drove down to honor Kessel, a Wisconsin native, and was lucky enough to have him autograph her jersey and her sign, which read, We drove from Wisconsin to see our Stanley Cup champion!
Some fans lined up the night before, and most waited several hours for the parade to start.
Karla and Don Donahue drove 30 miles from Freeport to claim their seats in Point State Park at 2:30 a.m. This was the third victory parade for the Donahues, who also attended in 2009 and 2016.
Karla Donahue said if they arent at the games theyre watching on TV.
If were somewhere else, its on the radio, she said. We havent missed a game in years.
The Penguins also won the Cup in 1991 and 1992. They became the first team to repeat as champions since the Detroit Red Wings did it in 1997 and 1998.
B.C. Liberal party members finish voting at 5 p.m. on Saturday, with the first results of their selections expected by 6 p.m. About 60,000 party members are eligible to vote on a ranked ballot with six candidates.
Here's what you need to know about each candidate:
• Mike de Jong has been an Abbotsford-area MLA since replacing Social Credit leader Grace McCarthy in a 1994 by-election. He served in most major cabinet roles, including five years as finance minister before the B.C. Liberal government's defeat last year.
De Jong's policy suggestions include expanding Mandarin language education in B.C. schools, moving the B.C. forest ministry headquarters from Victoria to Prince George, and offering parents full-day Kindergarten for four-year-olds.
• Michael Lee is a rookie MLA elected to represent Vancouver-Langara in 2017, and a former membership director for the B.C. Liberal Party. His policy book includes a pledge to make B.C. “gasoline free” by 2050, increase electric car incentives and promote car sharing. He wants to increase funding for school and community libraries and also increase independent and home-schooling options for parents.
• Todd Stone is the second-term MLA for Kamloops-South Thompson and former transportation minister. He has proposed dedicating B.C. tax revenues from the sale of legalized marijuana to deal with addiction and overdoses of hard drugs. In health care, he proposes to build more government-funded primary care centres in B.C. communities and increase training spaces for nurse practitioners.
• Sam Sullivan is a former Vancouver mayor serving his second term as MLA for Vancouver-False Creek. Sullivan has shaken up debates with his suggestion that the B.C. Liberal Party should bring back the Harmonized Sales Tax in a modified form to make it more popular. He is also proposing selling B.C. government liquor stores to their employees, similar to the way B.C. highway maintenance was privatized.
• Dianne Watts is the former Surrey mayor who resigned as Conservative MP for Surrey-White Rock to enter the B.C. Liberal leadership contest as the only candidate without a seat in the legislature. Her proposals include reinstating year-round seniors' discounts on B.C. Ferries, increase funding for community-based social and supportive housing and stop the provincial government from taking a dividend from B.C. Hydro and other Crown corporations.
• Andrew Wilkinson is a former party president in his second term as MLA for Vancouver-Quilchena. He has emphasized his opposition to the NDP-B.C. Green effort to convert to a proportional representation voting system, which he says will weaken rural B.C.
Wilkinson wants to abolish small business income on family businesses, increase mental health and addictions services and keep government stores out of marijuana retail sales.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved Gov. Jerry Brown's request for assistance in dealing both with the Oroville Dam crisis and damage from record storms that hit the state in January.
Brown issued a state of emergency on Sunday to make it easier for state officials to quickly respond to the situation at the dam, where two damaged spillways have forced the evacuation of more than 100,000 people.
Many residents returned to their homes Tuesday, but officials said they could be evacuated again if storms coming later this week cause water levels at the reservoir to rise too much.
“I want to thank FEMA for moving quickly to approve our requests. This federal aid will get money and resources where it's needed most," Brown said in a statement.
Outlook: Warriors-Cavaliers IV does not look much like the previous three versions, let alone the teams' last meeting in January when Isaiah Thomas, Dwyane Wade and Jae Crowder were still key Cavaliers. Cleveland improved defensively in the postseason from when it was the 29th-ranked unit in the regular season but still is vulnerable with James taxed heavily on offense and the difficulty for Tristan Thompson and/or Love to guard on the perimeter. Cleveland will not be able to get away with defensive inconsistency against Golden State's offensive inferno, particularly in Oakland where the Warriors boast a plus-16.3 scoring margin. James needs a refilled tank of energy, an All-NBA version of Love and an all-world effort from Hill against Stephen Curry. Andre Iguodala's knee issue, which kept him out for the last four games, is important for the 2015 Finals MVP's two-way role but the Warriors remain more loaded and tested without him.
“Football throws up strange results”.
Those were the words of David Moyes as he looked ahead to today's confrontation with high-flying Liverpool.
For Sunderland to get any sort of result against Jurgen Klopp's title chasers, you would expect it to be the strangest result of the season.
Sunderland have done it before on a New Year – who can forget Ji Dong-won's injury-time winner over Premier League leaders Manchester City on the first day of 2012?
But this will take some turnaround by the current Black Cats, whose injury woes grew further in the 4-1 weekend hiding at Burnley, with Lamine Kone and Victor Anichebe limping off with hamstring trouble.
“We're going to have to defend much better,” said Moyes who lamented Sunderland's failure to deal with “good-old fashioned English football”.
“It'll be a different type of game, but we've got to quickly get ourselves ready and prepare for that.
“Football sometimes throws up strange results at times and we've got to hope there's a strange result thrown up this week.
“[Liverpool is not a great game to be going into], but sometimes football can throw things up.
“We have to find a way of overcoming Liverpool, who have got a lot of strengths at the moment.
“We have to defend better than that because we've got forward players who, given some good service, are technically able to score goals.”
Moyes and his squad were back in at the Stadium of Light yesterday to check on the wounded and to get a team assembled to play Liverpool (3pm kick-off). “We need to see who's fit and available, dust them down and go again.”
Kone will be a major doubt on two fronts – firstly his injury, and secondly, the Cats boss has yet to learn if Ivory Coast will let him stay until after the Reds clash.
“We're waiting on the answer,” said Moyes, who will have Gabon's Didier Ndong and Tunisia's Wahbi Khazri available.
“We're hoping the Ivory Coast will allow us to keep him, but the truth is we haven't had the answer yet.
“The others have been given permission to stay for the game.”
The Denver Broncos are in prime position entering Thursday's draft to grab an impact player with the fifth overall pick.
Cornerback Chris Harris, however, hopes the player isn't taking snaps from under center.
"Someone who's going to come in and play," Harris told reporters Tuesday, per The Athletic's Nicki Jhabvala. "We need someone who's going to come in and play now, so whether that be [Saquon] Barkley, [Bradley] Chubb ... the guard from Notre Dame [Quenton Nelson]. One of those three guys. We know those guys can come in and play right now. Not a quarterback right now, I wouldn't say. We're trying to win now, man. We don't have time to wait."
The Broncos come off a 5-11 season after enduring a carousel of signal-callers with Trevor Siemian, Brock Osweiler and Paxton Lynch. Siemian led the trio by appearing in 11 games with 10 starts and completing 209 of 349 pass attempts (59 percent) for 2,285 yards and 12 touchdowns against 14 interceptions. Denver traded Siemian to the Minnesota Vikings day after free agency began and brought in former Vikings quarterback Case Keenum on a two-year deal worth $36 million.
NFL Network draft analysts Daniel Jeremiah and Bucky Brooks each have the Broncos taking a QB (Josh Allen and Josh Rosen, respectively) in their most recent mocks.
Meanwhile, the Broncos also experience personnel turnover in the secondary with the departure of Aqib Talib, who was traded to the Los Angeles Rams.
Talib's absence could lead many to question whether Denver can continue with the vaunted "No Fly Zone" pass defense, but Harris believes there won't be an issue.

Reality television personality Kim Kardashian will reportedly be in Washington D.C. Wednesday to discuss prison reform with White House officials and ask President Donald Trump to pardon a 62-year-old woman, who's serving a life sentence for a nonviolent drug offense.
The meeting, which is expected to take place Wednesday afternoon, follows months of talks between the "Keeping Up With The Kardashians" star and Jared Kushner, according to Vanity Fair.
Kardashian will first sit down with Kushner to discuss overhauls to the U.S. prison system before the two meet with Trump and White House counsel, the magazine reported.
Aside from focusing on prison reform, Kardashian is likely to press the president to pardon Alice Marie Johnson, a great-grandmother who has been imprisoned for more than two decades for a first-time, nonviolent offense, according to various news outlets.
Johnson was expected to be released under President Barack Obama, but was passed over when he granted clemency to more than 200 people for similar nonviolent offenses in December 2016.
Kardashian, who reportedly learned of Johnson's imprisonment through a video, gathered a team of attorneys to contact the White House on the woman's behalf.
Kanye West says he and Donald Trump 'are both dragon energy'
Kardashian's husband, rapper Kanye West, sparked headlines last month after posting a series of tweets in which he praised Trump's "dragon energy" and showed off his signed "Make America Great Again" hat.
West met with the then-president-elect at Trump Tower in New York in December 2016.
Halifax District RCMP is warning the public about sextortion, a scam that has been reported six times to police since the beginning of the year.
Police say in each case, a perpetrator asks the victim to perform a sex act during an online video chat, after gaining the victim's trust.
The suspect secretly records the video and threatens to release it to the victim's contacts if the victim doesn't give the suspect a certain amount of money.
READ: ‘Sextortion scam' reported in Elgin County
Police say in five of the six cases, the victim was a man and the suspect was a woman. The victims ranged in age from 17 to 52. In only one incident did the victim send money as demanded.
Police also say that while the videos were never sent to the victim's contacts as the suspect threatened to do, that doesn't mean it will never happen.

The Nova Scotia RCMP Tech Crime Unit says that one way to protect yourself from this type of scam is to avoid accepting friend requests on social media from strangers.
Some of the investigations are ongoing and some have been concluded without charges being laid, as the suspects cannot be located or identified.

(Reuters) - Roger Federer has pulled out of the Cincinnati Open with a back injury, meaning Rafa Nadal will return next week as the world number one for the first time since 2014.
Federer, who has participated in the Ohio warm-up tournament for the U.S. Open on seven occasions, said he had picked up the injury in Montreal, where he lost to Germany's Alexander Zverev in the final.
"I am very sorry to pull out of the Western and Southern Open as I always enjoy playing here," Federer said in a statement issued by the tournament.
"Cincinnati has some of the best fans in the world and I am sorry I will miss them. Unfortunately, I tweaked my back in Montreal and I need to rest this week."Federer's withdrawal assures that Nadal will be top of the rankings when they are issued on Aug. 21. The Spaniard will be back in the top spot for the first time since July 6, 2014.
Nadal will take the number one position from Briton Andy Murray, who previously announced he would not play in Cincinnati due to a hip injury.
Nadal, who has won one grand slam and two Masters 1000 titles in 2017, was upset by 18-year-old Canadian Denis Shapovalov at the Rogers Cup last week.

It replaces the grammatically challenged “Heart and Drive Lives Here” which had been in place since training camp.
“It's right, it's what we need to do,” said rookie winger Mitch Marner. “That's what we need to do. We need to play fast. We're a fast-paced team. We have to play like that every night.”
“Play Right. Play Fast” has gone up in the Leafs dressing room in both the MasterCard Centre and the Air Canada Centre.
The Leafs have had several slogans over the years, unlike the Montreal Canadiens who have stuck with “To you from failing hands we throw the torch be yours to hold it high” for as long as anyone can remember.
“What I did this summer, what I often do, is coming up with something and then the team forms an identity for themselves. Slap that baby up,” said Leafs coach Mike Babcock. “That's what we did. It gives you something to talk about.
Some Leaf slogans through the years:
“Burn the boats”
“Entitled to nothing; grateful for everything”
“If you are not in, you are in the way'
“Blue Noise”
“Success is hard work”
The slogan “Defeat did not rest lightly on their shoulders” is the one associated with the Leafs the most, going back to founder Conn Smythe.
TAVARES ROCKS: Leafs winger Matt Martin played with John Tavares for the first six years of his career, and developed a great deal of respect for the Islanders captain.
“He's the hardest-working guy in practice, after practice, off the ice, and drives everyone else on that team to work that much harder,” said Martin. “He's a humble guy as well.
“He hounds the puck. He wants the puck on his stick and wants to make plays. Playing with him that long, I've seen him grow into the player he is.
“He's definitely made a lot of good wingers, and made a lot of guys a lot of money. He's a top-end talent. It doesn't matter who plays with him, guys have success with him.”
SHARP ENOUGH: The Leafs did not have a morning skate on Tuesday, a surprise move given Monday was a practice day. Typically, the Leafs only skip morning skates if they played the night before.
“Why didn't we skate? Because I liked our practice (Monday). I thought we worked hard. I thought we were ready,” said coach Mike Babcock. “We're trying to handle the situation. We've got a back-to-back (Islanders on Tuesday, Blue Jackets in Columbus on Wednesday). We are just trying to handle the situation. We thought it was the best thing for us.
STANDINGS WATCHING: Coach Mike Babcock is paying attention to the standings more this year than he did last year.
“I know what they are daily,” said Babcock. “I didn't pay much attention to them last year. Just never looked at them. This year you pay more attention to them because you have an opportunity. Right now, we're in a really good spot. Two-thirds of the schedule is gone. We've got one-third left. We have to play our way in.”
EYES ON THE PRIZE: Rookie centre Auston Matthews says the team shouldn't get up for any one game more than any other game, that the effort should be the same regardless of the opponent or the position in the standings.
“We should be focused every single game, especially now with the position we're in,” said Matthews. “We feel good. We're in that timeline of teams pushing to make the playoffs. We don't want to have any setbacks. We want to continue to move forward.”
YOUTHFUL JOLT: Centre Nazem Kadri says the entire Leafs team feels energized by the seven rookies on the squad this year. “It's been fun, very exciting. It's re-energized the whole group, seeing new faces, young faces. They're being great for us, a big part of our team. The balance in scoring throughout our lineup has been the difference this year.”
If Jesus was to descend from heaven and physically set foot on 21st century earth, prosperity gospel televangelist Jesse Duplantis told his followers, the Redeemer would probably pass on riding on the back of a donkey: “He'd be on an airplane preaching the Gospel all over the world.” And Duplantis believes Jesus wouldn't exactly settle for 30 inches of legroom or getting patted down by TSA.
The Falcon 7X business jet is manufactured by Dassault Aviation SA. The $54-million jet is apparently what televangelist Jesse Duplantis needs. ( Mark Dadswell / Bloomberg ) Jesse Duplantis is the founder of Jesse Duplantis Ministries, which includes a weekly television program that reached 106 million U.S. households, according to his Amazon author biography. ( jdm.org )
Why would He choose anything less than the Falcon 7X, a private jet that nears the sound barrier but also has noise-limiting acoustic technology, a bluetooth-enabled entertainment centre and an optional in-flight shower? Duplantis, saying he needs roughly $54 million to help him efficiently spread the gospel to as many people as possible, has asked the Lord — and hundreds of thousands of hopefully deep-pocketed followers across the world — for just such a plane. He is the latest aircraft-seeking preacher to draw raised eyebrows and outright condemnation from critics who say asking for a multimillion dollar luxury jet is not exactly what Jesus meant when he said “store up for yourself treasures in heaven.”

But this is not the first time Duplantis has been enmeshed in the preacher private plane debate. The Falcon 7X would be his ministry's fourth jet — all paid for with cash drummed up from followers. And before anyone asks, he already has an answer for nonbelievers and critics who want to know why, exactly, his ministry requires a luxury jet that would make his fleet the same size as Donald Trump's. “We believe in God for a brand-new Falcon 7x so we can go anywhere in the world one-stop,” he told people on This Week With Jesse, a regular video broadcast on his website. The video on March 21 carefully mixed the Gospel with a few insights into the economics of international aviation. “Now people say . . . can't you go with this one?” he said, pointing to a picture of the plane he uses. “Yes, but I can't go it one-stop. And if I can do it one stop, I can fly it for a lot cheaper, because I have my own fuel farm. And that's what's been a blessing of the Lord.” Duplantis didn't immediately return calls from The Washington Post seeking comment.
In the video, Duplantis didn't specify which ministry-furthering missions the plane would be used for, although he has indicated in the past that he has an extensive travel schedule. Duplantis is the founder of Jesse Duplantis Ministries, which includes a weekly television program that reached 106 million U.S. households, according to his Amazon author biography. In 1997, he and his wife founded Covenant Church in Destrehan, La., just outside New Orleans.

“It is his mission to reach every soul of the 7 billion people that now inhabit the earth, making sure that each one has an opportunity to know the real Jesus — approachable, personable, compassionate, and full of joy-the way that he knows Jesus,” the biography says. He preaches the prosperity gospel, which says God shows favor by rewarding the faithful with earthly riches. Giving money to pastors and their ministries, leaders say, is a sort of investment. And prosperity gospel preachers have encouraged their flocks to invest heavily in aviation. In 2015, televangelist Creflo Dollar was widely mocked for starting “Project G650,” a means of getting a state-of-the-art Gulfstream G650 plane of his own, financed by his 200,000 followers. According to The Washington Post's Abby Ohlheiser, Dollar said he “needs one of the most luxurious private jets made today in order to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ.” The campaign was widely ridiculed online, and Dollar never made it to the waiting list, which consisted mostly of billionaires. “Could you imagine if before feeding the multitude w/ 5 loaves and 2 fishes, Jesus set up a gofundme account to buy a plane?” offered one Twitter criticism. Kenneth Copeland, another prosperity gospel adherent who has appeared on-screen with Duplantis, announced his ministry had purchased a Gulfstream V jet that likely cost millions. The announcement on Copeland's website showed him wearing a bomber jacket in front of a gleaming white plane. “Glory to God! It's Ours!” the website said. “The Gulfstream V is in our hands!” But the ministry needed more, it told followers. The plane was “an exceptional value” but needed another $2.5 million in upgrades. The ministry also needed to build a new hangar, buy special maintenance equipment and lengthen its runway to accommodate the new plane. After making the ask, Copeland prayed on camera for God to bless contributors. He and Duplantis defended their use of private jets in a widely shared — and mocked — YouTube video. “The world is in such a shape, we can't get there without this,” Copeland said of private aircraft. “We've got to have this. The mess that the airlines are in today I would have to stop, I'm being very conservative, at least 75 to 80, more like 90 per cent of what we're doing because you can't get there from here.” “That's why we're on that airplane,” he said. “We can talk to God.” Copeland said he used to travel with faith-healing prosperity preacher Oral Roberts, who flew commercial, and it “got to the point that it was agitating his spirit. People coming up to him. And them wanting him to pray over them. “You can't manage that today. This dope-filled world. And get in a long tube with a bunch of demons.” During his request for a new plane, Duplantis said he realized some people would remain skeptical. He said there was no obligation, and there was only one surefire way to determine what, exactly God wanted them to do: Prayer. “So pray about becoming a partner toward it, if you like to and if you don't, you don't have to, but I wish you would,” he said. “Because let me tell you something about it, it's going to touch people. It's going to reach people. It's going to save lives one soul at a time . . . “If you pray about it, I believe God will speak to you.”
House Republicans on Friday released a formerly classified memo regarding the early stages of the FBIs investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia. The four-page document, dated Jan. 18, 2018, was written by Republican members of the House intelligence committee under the subject line Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Abuses at the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The White House declassified the memo over the objections of the Justice Department and sent it to the intelligence committee chairman, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, for immediate release.
Here is the text of the memo:
Purpose
This memorandum provides Members an update on significant facts relating to the Committees ongoing investigation into the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and their use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) during the 2016 presidential election cycle. Our findings, which are detailed below, 1) raise concerns with the legitimacy and legality of certain DOJ and FBI interactions with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), and 2) represent a troubling breakdown of legal processes established to protect the American people from abuses related to the FISA process. (Continued below.)

Investigation Update
On October 21, 2016, DOJ and FBI sought and received a FISA probable cause order (not under Title VII) authorizing electronic surveillance on Carter Page from the FISC. Page is a U.S.citizen who served as a volunteer advisor to the Trump presidential campaign. Consistent with requirements under FISA, the application had to be first certified by the Director or Deputy Director of the FBI. It then required the approval of the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General (DAG), or the Senate-confirmed Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division.
The FBI and DOJ obtained one initial FISA warrant targeting Carter Page and three FISA renewals from the FISC. As required by statute (50 U.S.C. 1805(d)(1)), a FISA order on an American citizen must be renewed by the FISC every 90 days and each renewal requires a separate finding of probable cause. Then-Director James Comey signed three FISA applications in question on behalf of the FBI, and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe signed one. Then-DAG Sally Yates, then-Acting DAG Dana Boente, and DAG Rod Rosenstein each signed one or more FISA applications on behalf of DOJ.
Due to the sensitive nature of foreign intelligence activity, FISA submissions (including renewals) before the FISC are classified. As such, the publics confidence in the integrity of the FISA process depends on the courts ability to hold the government to the highest standard  particularly as it relates to surveillance of American citizens. However, the FISCs rigor in protecting the rights of Americans, which is reinforced by 90-day renewals of surveillance orders, is necessarily dependent on the governments production to the court of all material and relevant facts. This should include information potentially favorable to the target of the FISA application that is known by the government. In the case of Carter Page, the government had at least four independent opportunities before the FISC to accurately provide an accounting of the relevant facts. However, our findings indicate that, as described below, material and relevant information was omitted.
1) The dossier compiled by Christopher Steele (Steele dossier) on behalf of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Hillary Clinton campaign formed an essential part of the Carter Page FISA application. Steele was a longtime FBI source who was paid over $160,000 by the DNC and Clinton campaign, via the law firm Perkins Coie and research firm Fusion GPS, to obtain derogatory information on Donald Trumps ties to Russia.
a) Neither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding Steeles efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior DOJ and FBI officials.
b) The initial FISA application notes Steele was working for a named U.S. person, but does not name Fusion GPS and principal Glenn Simpson, who was paid by a U.S. law firm (Perkins Coie) representing the DNC (even though it was known by DOJ at the time that political actors were involved with the Steele dossier). The application does not mention Steele was ultimately working on behalf of  and paid by  the DNC and Clinton campaign, or that the FBI had separately authorized payment to Steele for the same information.
2) The Carter Page FISA application also cited extensively a September 23, 2016, Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff, which focuses on Pages July 2016 trip to Moscow. This article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News. The Page FISA application incorrectly assesses that Steele did not directly provide information to Yahoo News. Steele has admitted in British court filings that he met with Yahoo News  and several other outlets  in September 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS. Perkins Coie was aware of Steeles initial media contacts because they hosted at least one meeting in Washington D.C. in 2016 with Steele and Fusion GPS where this matter was discussed.
a) Steele was suspended and then terminated as an FBI source for what the FBI defines as the most serious of violations  an unauthorized disclosure to the media of his relationship with the FBI in an October 30, 2016, Mother Jones article by David Corn. Steele should have been terminated for his previous undisclosed contacts with Yahoo and other outlets in September  before the Page application was submitted to the FISC in October  but Steele improperly concealed from and lied to the FBI about those contacts.
b) Steeles numerous encounters with the media violated the cardinal rule of source handling  maintaining confidentiality  and demonstrated that Steele had become a less than reliable source for the FBI.
3) Before and after Steele was terminated as a source, he maintained contact with DOJ via then-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, a senior DOJ official who worked closely with Deputy Attorneys General Yates and later Rosenstein. Shortly after the election, the FBI began interviewing Ohr, documenting his communications with Steele. For example, in September 2016, Steele admitted to Ohr his feelings against thencandidate Trump when Steele said he was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president. This clear evidence of Steeles bias was recorded by Ohr at the time and subsequently in official FBI files  but not reflected in any of the Page FISA applications.
a) During this same time period, Ohrs wife was employed by Fusion GPS to assist in the cultivation of opposition research on Trump. Ohr later provided the FBI with all of his wifes opposition research, paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign via Fusion GPS. The Ohrs relationship with Steele and Fusion GPS was inexplicably concealed from the FISC.
4) According to the head of the FBIs counterintelligence division, Assistant Director Bill Priestap, corroboration of the Steele dossier was in its infancy at the time of the initial Page FISA application. After Steele was terminated, a source validation report conducted by an independent unit within FBI assessed Steeles reporting as only minimally corroborated. Yet, in early January 2017, Director Comey briefed President-elect Trump on a summary of the Steele dossier, even though it was  according to his June 2017 testimony  salacious and unverified. While the FISA application relied on Steeles past record of credible reporting on other unrelated matters, it ignored or concealed his anti-Trump financial and ideological motivations. Furthermore, Deputy Director McCabe testified before the Committee in December 2017 that no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information.
5) The Page FISA application also mentions information regarding fellow Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos, but there is no evidence of any cooperation or conspiracy between Page and Papadopoulos. The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 by FBI agent Pete Strzok. Strzok was reassigned by the Special Counsels Office to FBI Human Resources for improper text messages with his mistress, FBI Attorney Lisa Page (no known relation to Carter Page), where they both demonstrated a clear bias against Trump and in favor of Clinton, whom Strzok had also investigated. The Strzok/Lisa Page texts also reflect extensive discussions about the investigation, orchestrating leaks to the media, and include a meeting with Deputy Director McCabe to discuss an insurance policy against President Trumps election.

BOSTON -- Bruins veteran forward David Krejci returned to the lineup Monday for Game 3 of Boston's first-round playoff series against the Senators.
Krejci, who missed the first two games of the series with an upper-body injury, was centering a line with wingers David Backes and Drew Stafford. Krejci also was expected to return to his spot on the power-play unit.
Forward Noel Acciari, who was injured the last weekend of the regular season, also returned for Game 3 and was back on the right side with center Riley Nash and left wing Dominic Moore.
Editor's Picks Bruins' McAvoy learning on the fly With the Bruins down four defensemen because of injuries, rookie Charlie McAvoy -- whose skill set has been compared to P.K. Subban's -- made his NHL debut and had an instant playoff impact.
But the defensive group welcomed a new face for the fourth straight game. Tommy Cross, who has just three games of NHL experience, was recalled from Providence and paired with John-Michael Liles.
Defenseman Colin Miller, who suffered a lower-body injury in Game 1, skated Sunday and Monday and was considered a game-time decision, but was not ready to go.
Defenseman Adam McQuaid (upper body) did not skate Monday and is listed as day-to-day after being injured in Game 2. Cassidy also said there's no change in the status of Brandon Carlo (upper body) or Torey Krug (lower body), who were injured in the final two games of the regular season.
"Our blue line looks a bit like a puzzle that we're piecing together," Cassidy said.
Krejci said earlier Monday that it was disappointing to sit out the start of the series.
"After playing all 82 games you miss at least the first two games of the playoffs was disappointing, frustrating, but you have to work hard to get back at it and we've been doing that," he said. "I'm feeling better and we'll see how it goes tonight."
There is a new phenomenon I call “Twitter journalism”, in which people manages to eke out articles by stringing together Twitter “posts”. I myself have been tempted to do this, and sometimes have, though not very often.
But this is a website, and it's much worse when the tw**t assemblages are disguised as journalism. PuffHo, of course, is the worst offender that I know of (see this list, for instance), and here's the latest non-piece based on a single tw**t (click on screenshot if you must:
And the “perfect response”? It's just this, which is lame—and just another demonstration of how PuffHo has been driven literally insane by Trump:
Stay tuned for a piece tomorrow on how PuffHo's knee-jerk regressive Leftism caused it a huge embarrassment.
But Tw**t Aggregation is worse when the Washington Post, which has long enjoyed a reputation as a decent newspaper, engages in the same shenanigans. Have a gander at this “article” (click on screenshot):
The piece is in fact just a string of tw**ts assembled by reporter Cindy Boren. Is this reporting? I don't think so. Is it interesting? Hell no! Is it clickbait? Certainly. And here's the “perfect” response, which at least is slightly humorous.

Things are grim when this kind of stuff on social media becomes fodder for lazy reporters. Get off my lawn!
Security startup Canary is bringing a handful of new features to its camera products, the all-in-one and Flex. Most notable here is the addition of two-way audio, which has been conspicuously absent from the company's products and ranks as their “most demanded feature,” according to Canary.
The feature lets users speak through the camera, using a mobile device with the Canary app installed. That means you can talk to kids, nannies or speak to pets — which is something I definitely don't do. I do, however, speak to number of security camera makers, and they tell me that many users want this kind of feature enabled as a way to scare off would-be intruders, the minute the device's motion detector is triggered.
Terrifying a potential burglar sounds fairly cathartic and is a pretty solid argument for picking up a security cam in and of itself.
That feature is available now for the standard all-in-one Canary camera and is hitting the Flex next month. Oddly, it requires a membership to Canary's $10 a month subscription plan to utilize, as does desktop streaming from the company's newly introduced Web app. That feature moves surveillance beyond Android and iOS to the PC, which should make it easier to check in on things while you're at work.
In addition to those features, the company says it's also reduced the latency of real-time streaming to the app, which should make the two-way talk functionality less like watching a bad CNN satellite hook up. Notably absent in all of this is Echo Show functionality. Live views of security cams is one of the device's most killer functions, and Amazon seems to have enlisted just about all of the connected security camera companies other than Canary.
Now that this refreshed functionality has arrived, hopefully that's next up on the company's feature list.
PESHAWAR, Feb 15 (APP): About 15 kg of explosive was used in the
suicide bomb blast targeting a van carrying Civil Judge, Asif Jadoon and other judicial staff in Hayatabat Township on Wednesday, said Chief Capital Police Peshawar, Tahir Khan.
One person, driver of the van was killed and over ten injured due to
blast. The deceased has been identified as Khurshid, he added.
Talking to mediamen, CCPO Tahir Khan said the injured include three
ladies who were identified as Asifa, Rabia and Tehrima.
He said the suicide attacker targeted the vehicle of Civil judge, adding
that the Civil Judge and ten others were injured in the attack.
The injured were rushed to Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC) where their condition was stated stable, said PTI leader and former KP government spokesman Shaukat Yousafzai. He said emergency has been imposed in all hospitals here.
The police and security forces rushed to the site of blast and cordon
off the area while starting search operation. Rescue operation has been completed, the official added.
Brandon Ingram's duties as a Lakers rookie sometimes include carrying a veteran player's bags. In a year or two, Ingram might be asked to carry the entire team.
Ingram on Tuesday made his fourth straight start at small forward, a significant moment for the No. 2 pick in last year's draft. Earlier this season Coach Luke Walton wisely deflected some pressure away from his young players by saying he would judge individual progress before team results. When he gave Ingram a start it was because someone was injured, and Ingram found himself filling in at small forward, point guard and shooting guard.
Now, Walton is giving Ingram a chance to regularly start at small forward. It's a smart move and a challenge the still-gangly 19-year-old is approaching with eagerness and maturity.
“It means working hard to try to sustain a spot for the next years in this organization. It meant a lot, of course,” Ingram said of starting consistently. “It's another opportunity for me to play with another group on the court with our organization. Of course, it is a sign of responsibility and ownership and I'm definitely glad they have faith in me to take that position.”
Walton said Tuesday before the Lakers' 97-96 loss to the Sacramento Kings he plans to keep the lineup of D'Angelo Russell, Nick Young, Ingram, Julius Randle and Tarik Black together again on Wednesday at Phoenix. “And then getting back from All-Star [weekend] we'll stick with it and then we'll have a better idea of what we're looking like,” Walton said. “And maybe then we feel like we need to try some different groups, but we're just going to keep kind of taking it as it comes with that.”
Whatever changes Walton might make, keeping Ingram in the starting lineup should be part of his plan. It makes sense for Ingram and for the Lakers. They must find out what they've got. He must continue to learn what it takes to become an impact player on a team that needs him to grow in ways that go beyond adding muscle to his 6-foot-9, 190-pound frame.
“I think since he's been starting, he gets into a rhythm quicker,” Walton said. “Getting into a rhythm coming off the bench is tough. It's a skill you have to learn. Some players have mastered it, like Jamal Crawford, Lou Williams, guys like that. But with him starting, he normally finds his rhythm pretty early on out there.”
Ingram seems to be a quick learner. The biggest lessons he has absorbed so far, he said, are not about positioning or defensive schemes. “Just about time management and putting important things first, the way that this is your job coming in day in, day out, night in, night out,” said Ingram, who has his older brother Donovan living with him to help him navigate the freeways and get him to places on time. “I'm learning how I've got to take care of my body to get through this process.”
-
He was ill late in the Lakers' most recent trip, so Walton said it wouldn't be fair yet to grade his recent performances as a starter. Ingram had 14 points at Detroit and 15 at New York before scoring two in Milwaukee; he was averaging 8.1 points and 4.1 rebounds per game before he had six points, five rebounds and four assists against Sacramento on Tuesday and displayed only some of the liveliness Walton had hoped to see.
Next on Ingram's list of goals is to become more consistent. That's often the toughest hurdle for rookies because they're not accustomed to extensive travel and a hectic NBA schedule — and his schedule will include a trip to New Orleans with Russell to play in the Rising Stars Challenge during All-Star weekend. Being steadier is a point he brought up the other day when Brian Keefe, a Lakers assistant coach, asked what he intended to focus on the rest of this season.
“I told him I want to work on consistency, trying to stay efficient. I think that's been a big part of this year, just trying to stay consistent, stay efficient in my game,” Ingram said. “But of course, it comes with time and I know that, so I just try to keep getting better each and every day.”
Staying in the starting lineup is his best path to get there and to get the Lakers back among the league's elite. “I know when this thing turns around it's just going to be amazing,” he said. “I just want to be a big part of it.”

PESHAWAR, July 04 (APP):Caretaker Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Justice (retd) Dost Muhammad Khan and caretaker Federal Minister for Information, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Syed Ali Zafar Wednesday agreed to the overall rehabilitation and reconstruction of newly merged districts of erstwhile FATA into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
They also agreed to install an efficient governance structure, giving quick relief to the people of Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and more importantly bringing them into the national stream.
The minister briefed the chief minister on the quick measures, transfer of resources from the federal government to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, legal irritants, constitutional position, proposed exemption of FATA from federal and provincial taxes and collective responsibility for the infrastructure development in the newly merged districts.
The federal government would be recommended certain incentives, relief and expeditious transfer of resources for the overall recovery plan for rehabilitation and reconstruction of the newly merged districts, he assured.
He assured that the federal and the provincial governments were on the same page for removing the legal lacunas and irritants that might obstruct smooth transition of mainstreaming the tribal people.
The chief minister said his government took a number of decisions to discourage unnecessary use of resources.
He said the tribal people suffered heavily and the government had to move for quick relief to win them back. His government had already started working on preparing a plan for the infrastructure development and more importantly the quick rehabilitation of tribal people.
He had already set up a task force, which was working round the clock to remove lacunas in the law, making it compatible with the ground realities in tribal areas.
The chief minister said the government was making all out efforts to extend efficient services to the tribal areas and ensure their accessibility to the people. The extension of the jurisdiction of provincial offices to the new districts and giving proper training to the officers to be posted there have also been planned.
He stressed that no lacuna should be left as the same might be exploited by the miscreants. Mainstreaming the tribals should be the most focused area, he added.
The two sides agreed on continuation of the Riwaj system, besides extension of legal procedures, along with Lungi and provision of monthly stipend to Ulema. The rehabilitation and the recovery plan should take into account the interest of all segments of the society, they added.
The abrupt removal of system already in vogue could disturb the situation in the region and might also overburden the legal course, they observed.

The four women said they toiled long hours, without a break to eat or rest, over cracked hands and feet, repairing nails and massaging rough ankles.
Thu Hang Pham said she didn't get the day off when she had to go to a hospital for a biopsy.
Pham, Jenny Hoang, Tuyet Mai Nguyen and Trinh Truong told their stories, at times dabbing their eyes with tissues, as they sat on a couch at the Asian Americans Advancing Justice office in Santa Ana.
The women worked at Tustin Nailspa in the city of Orange, and were deprived of minimum wages and overtime pay despite their labor, said John Trang, an attorney for the civil rights group who is representing the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in December against three successive owners.
The women said the gleaming salon that started with fewer than 10 spa chairs added a dozen more in 2005, before the owners at the time hired more manicurists. After the remodeling and expansion, the shop became “swamped” with customers, they recalled.
The owners, My Le Tran and Le Nguyen, appeared to “feel pressured” to gain back the money they invested, triggering “endless workdays” and shifts that could not be missed, said Hoang, 48.
“They couldn't wait to make money and wanted to recover what they spent right away. So they took it out on us,” she said.
Nationally, nail salons comprise an $8.5-billion industry and are largely operated by first-generation Asian American entrepreneurs, many who are limited in English and struggle to blend into the mainstream economy.
Of the estimated 17,000 nail salons in the U.S., about 8,000 are in California, with more than 60% owned by Vietnamese Americans, according to industry experts.
“Owning a nail salon has been a vital means for upward mobility for many Asian American immigrants, especially in the Vietnamese American community,” Trang said. “While many owners strive to follow the law and include workers in their success, others have sought to enrich themselves by undercutting wages and passing business expenses onto their workers.”
The case has been complicated by a revolving door of attorneys — three sets for the plaintiffs and three sets for the different defendants.
Trang said his clients' first lawyer was removed from the case due to a conflict, and the second lawyer bowed out, unable to communicate with the women in Vietnamese.
“It's always a problem when parties change lawyers constantly,” said David Ezra, attorney for defendants Tran and Nguyen, the salon's original owners. “Because of that change, they're trying to make a lot of noise now. I don't believe in trying the case in the media.”
Karlfeldt Su, an attorney representing Hien Trinh and Tai Loc, the second set of owners, said in an email that “our position is that we deny all alleged wrongdoings. I can't speak on behalf of the other owners, but my clients did nothing unlawful during their operation of the nail salon, and should not have been dragged into this lawsuit in the first place.”
An attorney for the third owners of the nail salon could not be reached for comment.
The salon, near an Albertsons and squeezed between Bauhaus Hair Studio and Dollar $mart on North Tustin Street, is under new ownership again.
Last year, the New York Times published a series on challenges faced by manicurists, detailing hostile work environments that included physical abuse, exposure to toxic chemicals and having their tips docked as punishment.
The stories elicited pushback from the industry, leading to legislative actions, including rules to require ventilation at all New York state nail salons.
In 2013, an investigation of Tustin Nailspa resulted in $28,000 in fines against Tran and Nguyen, said state Labor Commissioner Julie A. Su.
In the end, we had to defend ourselves so workers who experience what we experience can find courage to fight back. — Jenny Hoang
“The climate of fear among immigrant workers makes these situations very hard to discover,” Su said. She plans to launch a task force early this year to examine workplace issues in the nail salon and other industries where immigrants make up the bulk of the workforce.
“It doesn't matter if you're paid by piece rate or by client. Workers need to feel safe in coming forward if there's a problem,” she said. “And under California law they are protected, regardless of immigration status.”
In the lawsuit against Tustin Nailspa, the women allege they were routinely underpaid. The owners made deductions on their pay checks for the use of spa chairs and supplies, Trang said. Their compensation was based on an unlawful “commission” system in which they earned about 60% of the total their customers paid for nail services, he added.
To hide such practices, Trang said, the owners devised a “fake universe of paperwork,” including bogus time records and pay checks to create an illusion that manicurists were paid lawfully by the hour.
“It was outrageous. They did everything they could to cover their trail in the event they would be audited — and they played corporate shell games — ‘selling' the salon three times in the span of one year,” Trang said.
The plaintiffs claim they were consistently required to clock out — then return to work. When they spoke up to say “we weren't comfortable with this, we didn't want to get in any trouble, they tried to change our status from full-time employee to contractors” to reduce their wage obligations, Nguyen said. Hoang, a mother of three who worked at the salon for nearly a decade, organized 30 workers to sign a petition opposing the new classification.
By the time the third set of owners took control, intending to convert the staff to contractors again and facing protest, three of the four plaintiffs were fired, according to the lawsuit. The salon changed hands a fourth time after the women filed their lawsuit in 2015 and the new people in charge fired the fourth plaintiff.
Only two of the four plaintiffs have found other salon jobs as far as in Baldwin Hills. Pham, 56, said she and Hoang have been “blacklisted” and “whenever we go to apply somewhere, they already know our names and turn us away.”
Hoang said she has suffered severe depression.
“We used to smile in front of the customers and try to carry on so we can support our families even with our limited English,” she said. “But I couldn't let them continue the way they treated us, as less than humans. In the end, we had to defend ourselves so workers who experience what we experience can find courage to fight back.”

Extradition is one of the tools to try to bring them to the national territory. In that effort, the court lists at least five orders to the United States and Peru.
In these countries, two people sought by the authorities were found. One of them is Carlos Pareja Yannuzzelli, former Minister of Hydrocarbons and former manager of Petroecuador of the current Government. The Interpol located him in the United States.
Partner Yannuzzelli was sentenced for alleged bribery. He also faces three processes for alleged embezzlement, illicit enrichment, and organized crime. The extradition proceedings will be remitted to the National Court of Justice in the coming days.
Carlos Pareja Cordero, investigated in Guayaquil for alleged money laundering, is another fugitive from justice. According to the information from the International Police, he would still remain in Peru.
Before these corruption scandals, justice already required the return of Brothers Roberto and William Isaias without success. They are part of the eight cases the Court records as “pending.” From 2000 to November 2016, requests for extradition from Ecuador (active extradition) to other nations increased. Since that year the power to rule such cases is in the hands of the president of the National Court of Justice. Before that year there are no records because the different Governments resolved the cases.

Amazon is getting out of the DVD rental business with the closure of Lovefilm, the so-called “Netflix of Europe” that Amazon bought in 2011 for a reported $312 million valuation. The company, which operates in the U.K. and Germany, is a subscription service that lets consumers rent DVDs that are sent out by mail – similar to Netflix's original business model before it became the streaming powerhouse it is today.
According to Amazon, however, DVD rentals by mail are no longer in demand.
“Over the last few years we've seen a decreasing demand for Blu-ray and DVD rental as customers increasingly move to streaming,” Amazon explained in an announcement posted to its website, detailing Lovefilm's closure.
The company says it will shut down the “Lovefilm By Post” service on October 31, 2017, as a result. Customers won't be billed for the last month, either, Amazon says.
The company also points to Amazon Prime Video as an alternative going forward, and even offers Lovefilm subscribers a £15 discount on a new Fire TV Stick, taking it down to £24.99. (A code that provides the discount is emailed during checkout from the page at amazon.co.uk/firetvstick.)
Amazon is planning to transition Lovefilm's staff – there are around 50 people there, Variety reports – to new roles at the company, instead of letting them go.
It's not surprising that Lovefilm By Post is shutting down. Streaming is rapidly eating away at the number of customers interested in “renting” movies by mail.
Though Netflix, too, still operates a DVD business, its numbers are dropping. There are some 4 million-plus DVD customers left, and they even have their own app for managing their rental queue. But it's streaming that's seeing growth – with Netflix beating industry expectations for the last two quarters, adding 5.2 million new customers in the last quarter, typically its weakest. The company now expects 108.3 million subscribers by the end of the current quarter in September.
Amazon's Lovefilm does not share its numbers, but at its peak it had some 3 million subscribers across both its DVD business and streaming arm, Lovefilm Instant – which was integrated into Amazon Prime Video several years back.

STRASBOURG: The European Parliament backed a contested EU-Canada free trade deal on Wednesday, facing down protests by activists and Donald Trump-inspired calls for protectionism.
MEPs meeting in Strasbourg, France, approved the pact with 408 votes in favour, 254 against and 33 abstentions.
Approval by the parliament allows the provisional implementation of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement as early as next month.
EU states and Canada formally signed the deal in October after seven years of tough talks, overcoming last-minute resistance from a small Belgian region that blocked its national government from approving the accord.
Protests marked the vote, with about 700 people marching outside parliament to voice their opposition to the deal.
Anti-globalisation activists dressed in surgical masks dramatically blocked entrance to the parliament building, before being dragged off by riot police.
"Saying yes to CETA is a trampling of the people," said a banner.
Following the approval by parliament, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will address MEPs in person on Thursday.
EU leaders see the deal as a victory for an imperilled global trade system that is under threat from US President Donald Trump who opposes international trade deals.
Opponents to the accord, which is known as CETA, slam the deal as a danger to health, democracy and the rule of law.
"CETA is the best trade agreement the EU has ever concluded. It will bring Canada and Europe even closer together," said German MEP Manfred Weber, the head of the conservative EPP group, the parliament's biggest bloc.
Deal 'attacks governments'
Some of the more controversial aspects, including a much-derided investor court system, still require ratification by EU member states, which could take years.
The EU is very ambitious about the deal, calling it Europe's most modern ever, and saying it will become a template for later deals, including with post-Brexit Britain.
CETA will remove 99 percent of non-farm customs duties between the two sides, a big win for exporters on both sides of the Atlantic.
And unlike classic trade deals, CETA harmonises regulations on matters such as health and the environment, a major concern for activists.
A major flashpoint for opponents is the proposal to set up special courts to settle disputes between investors and national authorities that is central to the deal.
Opponents believe this provision hands too much power to multinationals that will use powerful lawyers to undermine national regulation.
"Multinationals will be able to attack governments in a privatised court system," said France's far-right presidential candidate and MEP Marine Le Pen, who voted against CETA.
But the deal's EU negotiator, Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem, told MEPs that "nothing in this agreement undermines a government's right to regulate in the public interest".
The vote comes at a particularly sensitive time for global trade matters, with Britain poised to leave the European Union and new US president Trump rejecting an Asia-Pacific trade deal.
Trump is also widely expected to drop a similar proposed deal with the EU known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP.
Trudeau met with Trump on Monday in Washington.
Trump had vowed to put "America first" and rip up the North America Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, but significantly toned down that rhetoric after meeting Trudeau.

While Star Wars: The Last Jedi got the red carpet treatment at Star Wars Celebration this weekend with the unveiling of the first trailer, there are still only two more Star Wars movies definitively in the pipeline at the moment. The untitled Young Han Solo movie hits theaters next May, and the trilogy-capping Star Wars: Episode IX has a 2019 release date set. Beyond that, the future is uncertain. Obviously there will be more Star Wars movies, and Lucasfilm had planned to unveil a Boba Fett spinoff before director Josh Trank fell off the project and the movie was put on ice, but right now the studio is remaining mum.
Which is not entirely surprising. Rogue One only just hit theaters a few months ago, and that film was a major risk in terms of storytelling for Lucasfilm. Its success tells the studio that audiences will show up for Star Wars movies that don't involve the Skywalker family or even Jedi, and no doubt Lucasfilm's story team—headed up by president Kathleen Kennedy—are convening to map out where they want to go.
And indeed we may get a bit of clarity in a matter of months. Speaking with MTV's Josh Horowitz, Kennedy said that they're getting close to nailing down the next spinoff movie to follow Rogue One and Han Solo, and an announcement could come as soon as this summer:
“I think we're getting close. My hope would be sometime around the summer. I never want to predict the creative process because it is its own thing, so we're in the midst of those discussions right now.”
And while Horowitz had Kennedy's ear, he wanted to clear up some confusion that arose recently when Disney CEO Bob Iger teased that the Young Han Solo movie would reveal how the character “got his name,” leading some to believe we'll learn Han Solo really isn't Han Solo. But Kennedy says Iger's comments were likely misconstrued:
“I'm not sure that that's entirely what Bob meant. There's more to Han Solo's name, but it's not that it's not his name. It's obviously his name. It will always be his name (laughs).”
As for whether the Skywalker saga will continue past Episode IX, Kennedy first confirmed that IX does indeed conclude a classic trilogy structure:
“There's no question that this is set up as a trilogy and that three-act structure of the set-up, the conflict, and the resolution very much is what we have planned.”
But beyond Episode IX, Kennedy admits the Lucasfilm team hasn't yet settled on whether the films will continue the story of Rey, Finn, etc., start a brand-new story in a new era, or do something else entirely:

Conor McGregor of Ireland works out at the UFC Performance Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., August 11, 2017.
(Reuters) - Mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor says he has become "the face of the fight game" ahead of his upcoming multi-million dollar boxing match against Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas this month.
The 29-year-old Irishman, who has never boxed professionally, told reporters at the UFC Performance Institute in Las Vegas on Friday that his sole concern was getting the win, and that the cash was a secondary issue.
UFC lightweight champion McGregor is due to face the 40-year old Mayweather, who retied in 2015 with an unblemished 49-0, on Aug. 26 in a 12-round super welterweight boxing bout.
"I am the face of the fight game, period. And I'll rule over both (boxing and MMA) with an iron fist -- an iron left fist," he told reporters.
The fight against "Money" Mayweather will shoot the brash Irishman into the financial stratosphere, but McGregor said he was not worried about the cash.
"The word (money) isn't even in my vocabulary. I'm preparing to win, and to win in devastating fashion," he said. "I don't care about money. As long as I make my correct decisions and don't make stupid decisions, I'm set for life."
Wearing a robe made for him by fashion designer Donatella Versace, emblazoned with his name and "Notorious" nickname in gold on the back, McGregor said he felt in "pristine condition" as he had his hands wrapped for the workout.

"This is a fight that has been in my crosshairs since Floyd's been opening his mouth, simple as that," McGregor said of his decision to chase a match-up against one of the greatest boxers of all time.
Both fighters have said that the contest at the T-Mobile Arena will not go the full 12 rounds. Mayweather told the media at his workout on Thursday that the fight going the distance would represent a victory for his 29-year-old opponent.

"You know what I heard him say yesterday? Nothing," McGregor scoffed when asked about the statement.
"I saw a man scared, that's what I saw, I saw a lacklustre workout, I saw a man trying to talk himself out of it. That's what I saw."
McGregor warmed up and then pulled on his boxing gloves, working up a sweat on a selection of punch bags for 12 three-minute rounds.
After a flurry of punches on the final bag, McGregor still had one more parting shot for boxing fans who he says are bored with how their sport.
"I just want to say to all boxing -- it's OK to love me as much as I love me. It's OK. Let it go," a beaming McGregor said.
China has lodged a diplomatic protest with India over a visit by a parliamentary delegation from self-ruled Taiwan, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday.
Three Taiwanese parliamentarians, led by ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator Kuan Bi-ling, began their visit to New Delhi on Monday.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular press briefing in Beijing that China had lodged "solemn representations" with the Indian government over the issue.
"We have always been resolutely opposed to any country with diplomatic relations with China having any form of official exchanges, or establishment of any official institutions, with Taiwan. This position is consistent and clear-cut."
India's ministry of external affairs said the visit was informal.
"Such informal groups have visited India in the past as well for business, religious and tourist purposes. I understand that they do so to China as well. There is nothing new or unusual about such visits and political meanings should not be read into them," the ministry said in a statement.
A DPP official in Taipei said the legislators were scheduled to return to Taiwan on Thursday and were also in India to visit Taiwanese companies such as China Steel, Taiwan's biggest steelmaker which has a plant there.
Despite efforts by China and India to improve ties over recent years, deep suspicions remain, especially over a festering border dispute.
China considers Taiwan a wayward province, with no right to formal diplomatic ties with other countries.
Beijing has also increasingly squeezed Taiwan's international space following the election of Tsai Ing-wen as president last year.
China suspects she wants to push for the island's formal independence. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China.
A longstanding African ally of Taiwan's, San Tome and Principe, switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing in December.
"We have been requiring countries which have diplomatic relations with China to fulfil their commitment to the 'one China' principle," Geng said.
Defeated Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to the Communists. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control.
(CNN) -- A Texas lawmaker is lucky to be alive after an apparently stray bullet hit his head during a New Year's celebration early Sunday, authorities said.
State Rep. Armando "Mando" Martinez, D-Weslaco, said his wife had just given him a kiss shortly after ringing in the new year with family and friends, and the next thing he knew, "it felt like a sledgehammer hit me over the head."
A bullet fragment had just punctured the top of the south Texas legislator's head.
Martinez said he had just stepped outside a home in a rural neighborhood north of Weslaco when he was hit.
Martinez, 40, was transferred to the neurosurgical unit at Valley Baptist Medical Center in Harlingen, where surgeons removed the bullet fragment. The fragment had penetrated his skull and lodged itself into the dura mater, the top layer of the brain, doctors told Martinez.
The fragment appears to be from a .223 caliber round, said Martinez, who spoke to CNN by phone on Sunday while recovering at the hospital.
"Had it gone any further, I don't think we would be having this conversation," Martinez said.
Hidalgo County Sheriff Eddie Guerra said Martinez's survival was nothing short of a miracle.
The sheriff's office is investigating the shooting, and investigators "have reason to believe that (Martinez) was hit by a stray bullet," county sheriff's office spokesman JP Rodriguez said.
"There is no evidence to indicate he was targeted," Rodriguez said.
"It was a miracle last night. I was given another chance at life and I'm grateful for it," Martinez said.
Martinez was elected to a seventh term in November and scheduled to take the oath of office January 10.

A controversial application to build a new supermarket and family pub on a site in North Lincolnshire is set to be decided on.
Lidl UK has proposed plans to develop the new store on the site known as Top Field, off Ferriby Road in Barton-Upon-Humber.
But the application has sparked protest from local residents who have submitted an 1,800 strong signature petition against the plans.
The Top Field Action Group, who have submitted the petition to North Lincolnshire Council's democratic services, have issued the local authority with letter with intention to take the sale of the land to the Administrative Court.
Paul Chapman, chairman of the action group, said: "Residents have been incensed against the reckless intention of North Lincolnshire Council to line its coffers against the will of the people, its own policy to preserve open space and the will of residents."
A spokesperson for North Lincolnshire Council confirmed the receipt of the petition.
They said: "We can confirm that the council has received a petition opposing the development of the land."
Lidl's application seeks to erect the new supermarket along with a family pub and restaurant with accesses, car parking, servicing and landscaping.
The plans will see the relocation of an existing store in the town.
Objections have been raised by Campaign to Protect Rural England who have said that the plans are unsustainable and will lead to the loss of open space.
The application will be decided by councillors on North Lincolnshire Council's planning committee on Monday (December 18).
Kidney, Liver of Besigye Aide Rot
By John V Sserwaniko
Doreen Nyanjura, a leading assistant to Col Kizza Besigye, is grievously ill and has been confined home for the past few days.
Nyanjura (aka FDC Preacher) is also KCCA Lord Councilor representing Makerere University.
Yesterday she confirmed what has been a rumor for some days by disclosing to us that she was recently diagnosed with life-threatening liver and kidney conditions.
“It's true I was a few days ago diagnosed with very life-threatening complications on my liver and kidney.
The liver was found to have developed a mass which is 45 millimeters thick. I have so far done two scans and they have revealed the same thing.
The second one revealed that whereas my liver was in bad shape, my kidney is even worse and some doctors are saying I'm going to die anytime,” Nyanjura said on phone in an almost resigned voice.
She explained that trouble started on December 23rd.
“I was seated in a salon in Wandegeya as I prepared to travel to the village. Then all of a sudden I felt uneasy.
I was feeling a lot of pain and had breathing difficulties. I went to a clinic in Wandegeya and the doctor said I can't attend to you without carrying out some investigations because your condition is dire.
“I insisted that he gives me any pain killers to relieve this pain in my rib area. The doctor agreed and I got the drugs and went home.
“As soon I the drugs were done, the pain came back and this time it was more severe. I went for CT scans which confirmed the doctor's fears,” said Nyanjura.
Her usual cheerfulness was remarkably absent.
“Right now I'm on some medication and more tests have been ordered but I remain very weak and can't stand for two minutes. I must be seated down all the time otherwise I will fall down if I try to stand up without being supported.” She downplayed wild claims by her diehard defiance supporters on the Makerere defiance social media platforms that she was poisoned.
“I'm a leader Jonnie and I can't just make conclusions. Let's wait for more investigation results so that we speak authoritatively on what exactly caused this condition,” she said.
Strictly ruling out any foul play until reasonable evidence emerges pointing to that, Nyanjura explained how the whole thing started.
“I was brutally arrested on October 30th at Doctor's [Besigye] home in Kasangati as I commanded by colleagues uniting under ‘Women in Command.' KB [Besigye] had just returned from abroad and we vowed to guard his home as FDC women to ensure the police don't return to put him under house arrest.
“We were successful for one day. The following day the aliens [this is how she contemptuously always refers to police] deployed and as commander, I had to be arrested because we wouldn't allow them to detain doctor without a fight.
They brutally carried me away as soon as journalists left. It was late in the evening. They took me to Kasangati police station where I was beaten badly but two ladies as a bulky male police officer stood on my belly.
It was real torture and they said ‘we shall beat you until you denounce your claim that Besigye is the people's president.' My youths at Makerere mounted a social media campaign and they relocated me to Kawempe police station where the torture continued behind those thick walls.
They released me at 9.30pm after a crowd of campusers raided the station. The officer on duty tore the statement I had made because I insisted it must include my revelation that I was tortured.
Since that day I haven't been well to be frank with you but I thought it was the usual thing and I would be okay.
First was a sight problem which I was treated for and ordered to wear spects. This was followed by severe headache which has now graduated into these complications of the liver and kidney.
But more medical investigations will reveal the actual cause as I go for more tests,” said Nyanjura also called the iron lady. As Makerere Councilor, she has led many student demonstrations against police and government.
The foiled demo by defiance activists aimed at forcing Makerere's re-opening was perhaps her last major widely publicized demonstration.
Nyanjura, who is also FDC NEC member, is always with Ingrid Turinawe whom she fondly calls “Commander land forces.” The two are like-minded and Ingrid is politically her role model and mentor.
A number of FDC top bosses have over the years succumbed to liver complications including Vincent Kimera, Sam Njuba and Suleiman Kiggundu.
COSTA MESA, Calif. — Veteran centre Mike Pouncey agreed to a two-year contract Monday with the Los Angeles Chargers, who added a standout run-blocker to their powerful offence.
Pouncey was released by Miami last week after the three-time Pro Bowl selection refused a pay cut. He started all 16 games for the Dolphins last season, his seventh in the NFL.
The Chargers swooped in to grab a new centerpiece for what's likely to be an impressive offensive line. Los Angeles finished fourth in the league last season with 376.6 yards per game despite fielding only the 26th-best rushing attack.
Philip Rivers was sacked a career-low 18 times last season, but Los Angeles sometimes struggled to get traction with its running game. The offensive line's blocking was considered the primary reason for running back Melvin Gordon's inconsistency, and Pouncey is among the NFL's best run-blocking centres.
Pouncey is the second big-name veteran addition to the Chargers' line in two seasons. Los Angeles signed left tackle Russell Okung to a four-year, $53 million deal last year, and he promptly earned his second Pro Bowl selection in a standout season.
Okung and starting right tackle Joe Barksdale are returning for Los Angeles. Promising right guard Forrest Lamp is healthy after missing his rookie season due to injury, and fellow second-year pro Dan Feeney is likely to be the starting left guard.
Spencer Pulley started all 16 games at centre last season. The former undrafted free agent from Vanderbilt could be a versatile reserve after playing extensively at guard in college.
After winning nine of their final 12 regular-season games and barely missing the playoffs, the Chargers waited several days to make a splashy move in free agency. Los Angeles signed run-blocking tight end Virgil Green away from Denver, and also added kicker Caleb Sturgis to address last season's most problematic position.
The Chargers' only significant free-agent departure so far is seldom-used defensive lineman Jerry Attaochu's move to San Francisco.

On July 1, 2016, Canadiens fans were nervously waiting for news on Montreal's free agency plans. You would be lying if you said Alexander Radulov, from the Kontinental Hockey League, would be a Hab by the end of the day, but that's exactly what happened.
The immature, hot-headed, National Hockey League cast-off was back for another round with a team that wanted more “character” and a fresh start. His talent level was undeniable, but many had questions about his maturity or lack thereof. It was up to Radulov to prove the doubters wrong, and man has he ever. Since day one, you could see the talent on display. His hands are magical and effort is endless. Most importantly, his attitude and level of maturity have exceeded expectations.
The best part about Radulov's story is his genuine love for both the city and fans of Montreal. He repeats time and time again that the most important thing for him is to perform and win for Canadiens supporters. As a fan, that's all you can ever ask for from a player and he delivers that and more every single night.
After a season which Radulov posted 18 goals and 54 points in 76 games, we are now witnessing how great of a talent he truly is. He currently sits second in NHL playoff scoring with five points in three games and has been one of the Canadiens the best players so far.
Too Much to Handle
In just three playoff games with the Habs, Radulov has already made his mark. He scored the overtime winner in Game 2 and a Forsberg-esque highlight reel goal against one of the best goaltenders in the world to seal the deal in Game 3.
In any playoff series, your horses need to run if you want to have any chance. In the case of the Habs, Radulov is proving too much to handle for the New York Rangers, and that's no surprise given what we've seen all season. It seems like the motor on the Russian forward never stops. While players like Chris Kreider and Derek Stepan have simply disappeared for the Rangers, the “selfish and immature” Radulov keeps chugging along.
In saying that, we have to remember that we're only three games into what's hopefully a long playoff run. If the Canadiens want to make it a few rounds, Radulov and company have to keep the motor running. The good news for Habs fans is that if the regular season is any indication, they won't have to worry about that with 47.
Alexander Radulov – Wearing His Heart on His Sleeve
Signing free agents is always a crapshoot, you never really know what you're going to get. For example, remember Alexander Semin? The fact is, most of the time free agents don't live up to the expectations put on them with their new teams. Many thought it would be, but that's not the case with Radulov.
Each shift he takes, you can see his passion, effort and love for the game of hockey. His attitude is infectious and runs through the team. If you want a glimpse of it, just look at his reaction when his teammates score. I don't think there's a player in the NHL that gets more excited than him when he's not the one scoring. It's fun to watch.
Some players shy away from markets like Montreal and some relish the pressure on the big stage. Radulov is the latter. Montreal breathes hockey and the Canadiens offer an escape from day-to-day life. Players like Radulov give fans something to believe in. That's special.
When You've Got a Good Thing
While there's all this good going on with Radulov, slowly creeping up is the big decision of the offseason. Do the Canadiens and Marc Bergevin pay up, or risk one of their best players walk out the door?
In my opinion, the Canadiens don't have a choice. How could you let an elite player who's developed a love affair with your city leave after just one season? Bergevin and company hit the nail on the head with Alexander Radulov and they can't let him slip away. They believed in him when many didn't, and he ran with it.
My gut tells me after the expansion draft, he signs on the dotted line. The Habs have a good thing going. Radulov loves Montreal, and Montreal loves him back. I bet none of you expected me to write this back in August, but I'm happy and pleasantly surprised it's come to this point. Here's hoping I get to write about him for many years to come.

It's no walk in the park.
Trail builders Mark Walsh and Rémi Gauthier recently asked Queen Charlotte council to formally support a 10 km hiking trail they have started making along the forested slopes and ridge between Queen Charlotte and Skidegate.
Called the Chief Dempsey Collinson Memorial Heritage Trail, Walsh and Gauthier say it would be a popular hike, a living museum of Haida and non-Haida heritage features, and an effective way to protect the villages' nearby forests and creeks from logging.
Much of the proposed trail is in the Haida Gwaii timber-supply area (TSA), though it also crosses through protected cedar stewardship areas. Walsh and Gauthier would like to see the unprotected areas along the trail removed from the TSA.
“The main objective here is to protect this whole area,” said Missy McDonald, a Skidegate band councillor who is helping Walsh and Gauthier bring their idea to the B.C./Haida Nation Solutions Table for consideration.
“People don't understand the cultural significance to the Haidas for this area alone,” McDonald added, noting there are 54 culturally modified trees along the Crabapple/Gore Creek section that Walsh and Gauthier have marked so far. It is also where Mouse Woman / Kuugan Jaad is said to have got her power and shared it with other supernatural beings.
“It has to be saved,” McDonald said.
Mayor Greg Martin and fellow councillors chose to wait until June 4 before deciding on official village support for the project, giving them time to learn exactly how it might affect forestry tenures.
The TSA portion of the proposed route is expected to become part of a future Haida Gwaii Community Forest, which the village has supported already.
“I don't want to see any logging in the watershed either,” said Mayor Martin, adding that the village may have more control if the TSA remains unchanged.
“It's an issue of means and ends,” he said.
“This sounds great, I'd just like to see more info before we provide anything official,” said Councillor Devin Rachar.
Councillors said they would consult with Janine North, executive director of the Misty Isles Economic Development Society, before the next regular council meeting on June 4.
Walsh said he hoped the area would eventually get the same level of protection as the Damaxyaa Heritage Site / Conservancy and Dover Trail near Sandspit.
“We think it's very important to get the same status for this whole forest behind town and Skidegate, and up over the top of the hill into the drainage of all the creeks that come down through town here,” he said.
Brazil's state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro may extend the deadline for potential bidders for a 60 percent stake in four refineries to sign non-disclosure agreements, a person with knowledge of the matter said to Reuters.
A ruling from Supreme Court Justice Ricardo Lewandowski this week requiring Congress to approve all sales programs of state-controlled companies threw up another roadblock to the effort to sell the refineries, which had attracted only lackluster interest from potential buyers.
Petrobras did not respond to requests for comment.
The deadline for potential buyers to sign nondisclosure agreements for the refinery partnerships - a first step in the sale process that does not signal firm interest - had been set for next Monday, July 2, but the person said it may be extended.
In a securities filing released on June 18, Petrobras said that five companies had signed nondisclosure agreements, a step that allows them to access more detailed information about the refineries.
Reuters reported last month that Petrobras' decision to cut diesel prices in response to a truckers' protest was spooking potential refinery buyers.
Brazilian conglomerate Ultrapar Participações SA, Cosan SA Industria e Comercio and Cepsa SA, an energy company controlled by sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Development Co, are among the five companies that signed non disclosureagreements, one source with knowledge of the matter said.
Another source said Petrobras hopes to get more potential bidders to sign non-disclosure agreements before proceeding to the next phase of the refineries sale.
Despite the Lewandowski decision, which has cast a pall over efforts to sell Brazilian state assets in general, a third source within the oil company said it still intends to sell the refineries and is working to conclude the process, as approved by the board.
The refineries are expected to be sold in two regional blocks: one in Brazil's northeast and another in the southern region of the country. Each refinery cluster Petrobras put up for sale has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), a common gauge of operating profits, of $1 billion, according to a fourth person with knowledge of the process.

The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has released its 2018 report on the state of public pools and it isn't exactly pretty. According to the report, which you can see in its raw form here, more than 27,000 people have gotten ill from recreational water, including pools, hot tubs and splash pads, in the United States over the span on 2000-2014.
Outbreaks of infectious etiology include Cryptosporidium (think major gastro issues), Legionella (can lead to pneumonia) and Pseudomonas (otherwise known as ‘hot tub rash' – enough said). 32% of outbreaks, which the CDC defines as when at least 2 people report similar illness, occurred in hotels, with half of all outbreaks nationwide occurring during June-August with a smaller peak in March.
While most pathogens are inactivated within minutes of coming into contact of chlorine-treated recreational water, some are particularly stubborn. Cryptosporidium, or ‘crypto' to which it is commonly referred, carries a higher-than-most tolerance against chlorine-treated water, able to survive for more than 7 days. It is most often transmitted when a ‘diarrheal incident occurs in the water and the contaminated water is ingested.'
Sustained attention to ‘improving design, construction, operation and management of public treated recreational water venues' is the first-line of defense against pathogens. Educating the public about things such as not letting kids swim if they're sick or have diarrhea is also paramount.
However, the next time you dive in your pool, still remember that “As long as the pH and chlorine levels in the pool are being maintained, the disinfectants will kill off most germs that could make you ill.” (Reader's Digest)

The flamboyant TNM Super League of Malawi favourites Be forward Wanderers FC gathered fabulous momentum over the weekend as they taught Mzuni students a classical and championship football lesson on Sunday at Civo stadium in Lilongwe.
Nomads team manager Steve Madeira told reporters after game that what they wanted was to win against and Mzuni saying its a green light to TNM glory.
“We told our boys that lets go play and teach them football in Lilongwe so that we can forget about this game. Remember this was a game that had a lot of issues involved. Many people developed emotions over this game so we wanted to prove people that we don't take points from the table but on pitch, because many people thought by launching an appeal on that abandoned match in Balaka we wanted free points but we needed true justice.” Madeira narrated.
All the troubleS for Mzuni started with the motivational opener from Yamukani Chester who scored in 16th minute in the first half and that followed with the equaliser punched by Zeliat Nkhoma in 32nd minute and first half ended in 50-50 affairs.
Came second half, more fire came razing the hostels of Mzuni students rendering them hostel less after Esau Kanyenda was knocked down in the danger zone and captain Joseph Kamwendo could not make a mistake as he flared the ball past Chimwemwe Kunkwawa who was too flattered to see the penalty, making it 2-1 in 51st minute.
No much time passed as Peter Wadabwa in 65th minute ended his goal drought connecting a corner heading into the net making it 3-1 to Wanderers FC.
Alex Ngwira, Mzuni coach was quick to concede a defeat and he said his boys lost momentum and confidence soon after the penalty scored by Kamwendo which he called it dubious.
“We played well but our opponents had the game in mind and utilised all the chances converting all important goals and that has helped them win the match.
“Right now our focus will be on our remaining games against Blantyre united and Red Lions so that we can keep our mission alive in the league. And our hope is at least to finish on 40 points,” Ngwira explained.
As it stands, Be forward have 65 points accumulated from 28 games as their contender Nyasa Big Bullets and who have 61 points. Their next assignments this weekend, are against Masters Security and Dwangwa united and finish the season with Red Lions and Masters Security respectively.
The league is expected to rubber stamp everything on Saturday 23 December, 2017 when Silver Strikers will be rapping up the season with Civil Sporting and the holding champions Kamuzu Barracks hosting Dwangwa united.
Iran Focus
London, 15 Feb - The Iranian Regime murdered tens of thousands of political dissidents within a ten-year period from their bloody takeover in 1979, including at least 30,000 during the summer of 1988, according to a source close to the Regime.
This was already made public by the Iranian Resistance but has now received confirmation.
Sadeq Zibakalam, a political science professor at Tehran University, who is closely linked to Ali Akbar Hashem Rafsanjani, the former head of Iran's Expediency Council.
He states that the executions of those many thousands of dissidents, many from the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK), were not judicial and their ‘trials' did not prove any crime.
He notes that the audio tape of a meeting of the Death Committee in 1988, which was released last summer by Ahmad Montazeri, proved that the executed had committed no crimes. Montazeri has been sentenced to 21 years in jail for releasing that tape.
Zibakalam was being interviewed regarding a film festival, held every year to mark the anniversary of the Regime's takeover, and the new film “Majaraye Nimrooz” (Midday Adventures), which depicts the decade following the 1979 regime change from the mullahs' point of view.
He criticised the movie, produced in part by the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), as untruthful.
He said: “We accuse the MEK of conducting a series of assassinations back in the 1980s. Did MEK members carry out these measures for no reason at all?”
It depicts the IRGC as heroes, whereas Zibakalam admits that they killed thousands of MEK members in Evin Prison without due process.
Even, the current Justice Minister, Mostafa Pour-Mohammadi, has claimed he was ‘proud' of his role in sending thousands of innocent people to the gallows during the 1988 massacre.

Iranian Regime gets desperate; holds 300 exhibitions against MEK
The Iranian Regime held 300 exhibitions against the resistance group, MEK, in an increasingly desperate attempt to smear the Iranian Opposition.
This is believed to be in response to a report by the Regime's Ministry of Intelligence which detailed the power of the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI or MEK) and the progress they have made.
The report noted that young people are far more likely to side with the Resistance and that the Iranian Resistance is highly respected both at home and abroad.
Hashemi Nejad the director general of the state-funded foundation, Habilian, said: “We have held 300 exhibitions against MEK in Iran up to now. These days, MEK is getting recognised as a leading institute in Human Rights, our duty is to discuss Human Rights issues against MEK since Iranian youths are the target of MEK.”
The report noted that the MEK favoured regime change and the removal of the Iranian mullahs, but the MEK have never made a secret of that.
It also highlighted that the MEK had assisted the West by revealing Iran's secret nuclear missiles programme.
They noted that in order to stop the youth from joining the MEK, the Regime would have to present a totally warped view of the Resistance Forces, which is what they have attempted to do with the exhibitions.
The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) noted in their recap of the report, that it was weird to hear the Regime admit that they had been trounced by the Resistance in terms of support from the Iranian people.
They wrote: “The truth is that after the regime was unable to destroy the MEK by inhumane siege and missile attacks and Mojahedin were able to maintain the integrity of their organisation and transfer themselves to a safe place, the regime is frightened now. That is why the mullahs regularly yowl and whimper about the danger of Mojahedin.”
They continued: “This fear and sense of danger is particularly due to the fact that the power and cohesion of the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran has coincided on the one hand with the weakness and ultimate decay of the Velayat-e faqih regime and the crises engulfing the regime, and on the other hand by the fact that Iran's society is on the verge of explosion and ready for uprising and revolution and is only waiting for a spark.”
More about the People's Mojahdin Organization of Iran (PMOI/ MEK)
The People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (Also known as MEK, or Mujahedin-e-Khalq / Mujahedeen-e-Khalq), was founded on September 6, 1965, by Mohammad Hanifnejad, Saeed Mohsen, and Ali-Asghar Badizadgan. All engineers, they had earlier been members of the Freedom Movement (also known as the Liberation Movement), created by Medhi Bazargan in May 1961.1
The MEK's quest culminated in a true interpretation of Islam, which is inherently tolerant and democratic, and fully compatible with the values of modern-day civilization. It took six years for the MEK to formulate its view of Islam and develop a strategy to replace Iran's dictatorial monarchy with a democratic government.
MEK's interpretation of Islam
The theocratic mullah regime in Iran believe interpreting Islam is their exclusive domain. The MEK reject this view and the cleric's reactionary vision of Islam. The MEK's comprehensive interpretation of Islam proved to be more persuasive and appealing to the Iranian youth.
MEK's founders and new members studied the various schools of thought, the Iranian history and those of other countries, enabling them to analyze other philosophies and ideologies with considerable knowledge and to present their own ideology, based on Islam, as the answer to Iran's problems.
MEK's leadership's arrest during the 70s.
The Shah's notorious secret police, SAVAK, arrested all MEK leaders and most of its member's in1971. On May 1972, the founders of the MEK, Mohammad Hanifnejad , Saeed Mohsen and Ali Asghar Badizadegan, along with two members of the MEK leadership, Mahmoud Askarizadeh and Rasoul Meshkinfam, were put before death squads and were executed after long months of imprisonment and torture. They were the true vanguards, who stood against the dictatorial regime of Shah. However, they are also recognized for their opposition to what is today known as Islamic fundamentalism.
The death sentence of Massoud Rajavi, a member of MEK's central committee, was commuted to life imprisonment as a result of an international campaign by his Geneva based brother, Dr. Kazem Rajavi (assassinated in April 1990 in Geneva by mullahs' agents) and the personal intervention of the French President Georges Pompidou and Francois Mitterrand. He was the only survivor of the MEK original leadership.
Massoud Rajavi's critical role in characterizing religious extremism
From 1975 to 1979, while incarcerated in different prisons, Massoud Rajavi led the MEK's struggle while constantly under torture for his leading position.
Massoud Rajavi stressed the need to continue the struggle against the shah's dictatorship. At the same time, he characterized religious fanaticism as the primary internal threat to the popular opposition, and warned against the emergence and growth of religious fanaticism and autocracy. He also played a crucial role when some splinter used the vacuum in the MEK leadership who were all executed or imprisoned at the time, to claim a change of ideology and policy. Massoud Rajavi as the MEK leader condemn these individual's misuse of MEK's name while continuing to stress the struggle against dictatorship. His efforts while still in prison forced these individuals to no longer operating under the name of MEK and adopting a different name for their group. These positions remained the MEK's manifesto until the overthrow of the shah's regime.
Release of Political Prisoners on the last days of the Shah
A month before the 1979 revolution in Iran, the Shah was forced to flee Iran, never to return. All democratic opposition leaders had by then either been executed by the Shah's SAVAK or imprisoned, and could exert little influence on the trend of events. Khomeini and his network of mullahs across the country, who had by and large been spared the wrath of SAVAK, were the only force that remained unharmed and could take advantage of the political vacuum. In France, Khomeini received maximum exposure to the world media. With the aid of his clerical followers, he hijacked a revolution that began with calls for democracy and freedom and diverted it towards his fundamentalist goals. Through an exceptional combination of historical events, Shiite clerics assumed power in Iran.
Khomeini's gradual crackdown on MEK in fear of their popular support
In internal discourses, Rajavi the remaining leader of the MEK, argued that Khomeini represented the reactionary sector of society and preached religious fascism. Later, in the early days after the 1979 revolution, the mullahs, specifically Rafsanjani, pointed to these statements in inciting the hezbollahi club-wielders to attack the MEK.
Following the revolution, the MEK became Iran's largest organized political party. It had hundreds of thousands of members who operated from MEK offices all over the country. MEK publication, ‘Mojahed' was circulated in 500,000 copies.
Khomeini set up an Assembly of Experts comprised of sixty of his closest mullahs and loyalists to ratify the principle of velayat-e faqih (absolute supremacy of clerical rule) as a pillar of the Constitution. The MEK launched a nationwide campaign in opposition to this move, which enjoyed enormous popular support. Subsequently, the MEK refused to approve the new constitution based on the concept of velayat-e faqih, while stressing its observance of the law of the country to deny the mullahs any excuse for further suppression of MEK supporters who were regularly targeted by the regime's official and unofficial thugs.
Khomeini sanctioned the occupation of the United States embassy in 1979 in order to create an anti-American frenzy, which facilitated the holding of a referendum to approve his Constitution, which the MEK rejected.
MEK's endeavors to participate in the political process avoiding an unwanted conflict with government repressive forces
The MEK actively participated in the political process, fielding candidates for the parliamentary and presidential elections. The MEK also entered avidly into the national debate on the structure of the new Islamic regime, though was unsuccessful in seeking an elected constituent assembly to draft a constitution.
The MEK similarly made an attempt at political participation when [then] Massoud Rajavi ran for the presidency in January 1980. MEK's leader was forced to withdraw when Khomeini ruled that only candidates who had supported the constitution in the December referendum – which the MEK had boycotted- were eligible. Rajavi's withdrawal statement emphasized the MEK's efforts to conform to election regulations and reiterated the MEK's intention to advance its political aims within the new legal system”. (Unclassified report on the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran(PMOI/ MEK) by the Department of State to the United States House of Representatives, December 1984.)
However, the MEK soon found itself in a direct struggle against the forces of the regime's Supreme leader. The MEK's differences with Khomeini dated back to the 1970s, and stem from its opposition to what is known today as Islamic extremism. Angry at the position taken by the MEK against his regime and worried about the MEK's growing popularity, Khomeini ordered a brutal crackdown against the MEK and its supporters. Between 1979 and 1981, some 70 MEK members and sympathizers were killed and several thousand more were imprisoned by the Iranian regime.
June 20, 1981- Khomeini's order to open fire on peaceful demonstration of half-a-million supporters of MEK
The turning point came on 20th June 1981, when the MEK called a demonstration to protest at the regime's crackdown, and to call for political freedom which half-a-million supporters participated at. Khomeini ordered the Revolutionary Guards to open fire on the swelling crowd, fearing that without absolute repression the democratic opposition (MEK) would force him to engage in serious reforms – an anathema as far as he was concerned; he ordered the mass and summary executions of those arrested.
Since then, MEK activists have been the prime victims of human rights violations in Iran. Over 120,000 of its members and supporters have been executed by the Iranian regime, 30,000 of which, were executed in a few months in the summer of 1988, on a direct fatwa by Khomeini, which stated any prisoners who remain loyal to the MEK must be executed.
Having been denied its fundamental rights and having come under extensive attack at the time that millions of its members, supporters and sympathizers had no protection against the brutal onslaught of the Iranian regime, the MEK had no choice but to resist against the mullahs' reign of terror.
“Towards the end of 1981, many of the members of the MEK and supporters went into exile. Their principal refuge was in France. But in 1986, after negotiations between the French and the Iranian authorities, the French government effectively treated them as undesirable aliens, and the leadership of the MEK with several thousand followers relocated to Iraq.” (Judgment of the Proscribed Organizations Appeal Commission, November 30, 2007.)
MEK Today
The MEK today is the oldest and largest anti-fundamentalist Muslim group in the Middle East. It has been active for more than a half century, battling two dictatorships and a wide range of issues. The MEK supports:
• Universal suffrage as the sole criterion for legitimacy
• Pluralistic system of governance
• Respect for individual freedoms
• Ban on the death penalty
• Separation of religion and state
• Full gender equality
• Equal participation of women in political leadership. MEK is actually led by its central committee consist of 1000 women.
• Modern judicial system that emphasizes the principle of innocence, a right to a defense, and due process
• Free markets
• Relations with all countries in the world
• Commitment to a non-nuclear Iran
The MEK remains a strong and cohesive organization, with a broad reach both worldwide and deep within Iran. MEK is the leading voice for democracy in Iran, supported by its interpretation of Islam that discredits the fundamentalist mullahs' regime.

The Pakistan Cricket Board's (PCB) aggressive posture has not exactly fazed the members of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and they say the PCB is free to take the legal recourse for the 'dishonoured' agreement over the scrapped bilateral series in 2015.
“It can do whatever it wants. When there is no permission from the government, the BCCI can do little," said an influential BCCI member.
Two Tests, five ODIs and two Twenty20 Internationals were to be played and the PCB offered to host India in the UAE or Sri Lanka.
Claiming losses to the tune of over $100 million, the PCB said it would seek compensation.
The BCCI says the PCB has to first raise the matter formally at the International Cricket Council (ICC) forum and the understanding is that that matter was informally discussed at the ICC forum already and the world body, as has been its position, wanted the bilateral issue settled between the boards.
“At the Cape Town meeting, the PCB asked for funds from the ICC in view of the losses due to India not playing them. If they wish to file a case against us, let them do it. We will see when we get the notice," said another BCCI member, who was present at the Cape Town meeting in October last year.
The Pakistan team is slated to tour India in December for three Tests, five ODIs and two Twenty20 Internationals and the indication from the PCB is that its team will not tour till India honoured its agreement.
The BCCI too is not sure if it will get the permission from the government of India to host Pakistan.
But it is not worried for the end-of-the year fixtures because it has to worry about things in the beginning of the year.
PORTLAND, Maine (AP)  The state has lost its effort to impose a greater penalty on a nurse whose license was suspended after letting a disoriented patient leave a hospital during a snowstorm.
The 61-year-old patient was found dead the next day just 380 feet from the entrance of Down East Community Hospital in Machias, leading to an investigation of nurse John Zablotny's actions and an effort by the Maine State Board of Nurses to revoke his license for two years.
A judicial review ordered by the state supreme court reduced the penalty imposed by the Board of Nursing to a 90-day suspension, which was affirmed by the state supreme court on Tuesday.
The judge found that Zablotny failed to provide adequate and complete information to the patient about the risks of leaving the hospital on Jan. 1, 2008.

The patient, Reid Emery, of Eastport, was dressed only in slippers, socks, pants and a flannel shirt. He died from exposure and opiate toxicity.
Zablotny's lawyer, Joe Baldacci, said the tougher sanction sought by the state amounted to an "overreach" that was rejected by two courts. Zablotny has been working continuously since 2010 at Mount Desert Island Hospital and has earned good reviews for the care he provides, the attorney added.
The attorney general's office said it continued to pursue the case because of Zablotny's disregard for his patient's safety and his refusal to acknowledge his errors.
"This relatively minor sanction for what was truly egregious conduct compelled the Board of Nursing to seek review of the (lower court's) decision in order to protect the public safety," said Timothy Feeley, spokesman for the attorney general's office.
TOKYO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average fell on Friday on weakness in most sectors, with banking stocks down on worries that domestic bond yields would be kept low after the central bank conducted a special bond purchase operation to curb rising yields.
Kyocera Corp tumbled 6.6 percent and was the biggest negative contributor to the Nikkei after it cut its annual net profit outlook.
The Nikkei dropped 0.9 percent to 23,274.53. For the week, it dropped 1.5 percent.
The broader Topix shed 0.3 percent to 1,864.20, with 26 of its 33 sectors falling.
The Bank of Japan on Friday conducted a special bond purchase operation to stem the rise in Japanese bond yields, offering to buy an unlimited amount of JGBs with more than five to ten years left to maturity.
Bank shares, which rose the previous day after some banks posted upbeat earnings results, lost ground. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group shed 1.4 percent, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group fell 1.2 percent and Mizuho Financial Group declined 1.1 percent.
Bucking the weakness, Kobe Steel jumped 5.8 percent after it reinstated its annual profit forecast. (Reporting by Ayai Tomisawa; Editing by Sam Holmes and Eric Meijer)

The Metropolitan Community Church is hosting a vigil Sunday night to remember the five men who are presumed dead at the hands of alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur.
“We all feel a mix of horror and sadness and fear… I think the whole city is grieving,” said Rev. Jeff Rock, senior pastor with the Metropolitan Community Church located in the Gerard Street East and Logan Avenue area.
Earlier this week, Toronto police charged alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur with three more counts of first-degree murder, in addition to the two laid earlier this month, following an investigation into the deaths of missing men in the city's Church and Wellesley neighbourhood.

Investigators identified the deceased as 58-year-old Majeed Kayhan, who was part of the Project Houston probe looking into the disappearances of three missing men from 2012 to 2014; 50-year-old Soroush Mahmudi, who was reported missing by his family in Scarborough in 2015; and Dean Lisowick, believed to be in his 40s, who was never reported missing and lived in Toronto's shelter system. Police believe he died between May 2016 and July 2017.
McArthur, 66, a self-employed landscaper, was initially charged with first-degree murder two weeks ago in connection with the disappearances of Andrew Kinsman and Selim Esen from The Village.

The church posted information on the vigil on its website and Rock said the church has cancelled its regularly scheduled mass and will replace it with the vigil on Sunday at 7 p.m.
“We're intentionally not doing a religious-based service but something for the broader community. We have a seating capacity of 600 and I think it would be a real show of solidarity if we got that many people,” he said.
“We are ready to fill this place with a lot of love.”

Rock's intention is for the event to create a safe place for people to grieve.
“Just recognizing there are a lot of unsettled things on people's hearts,” he said.
“This candlelight vigil is designed to create a place for people to grieve and for people to be together so people know they are not alone.”

Bell said the "majority" of overtime hours were logged from the period of Sept. 25 through Oct. 1, the first week of construction work. Another chunk came for a small rally near the site held Dec. 9, long after the walls were up and construction crews had departed.
The medical board alleged that Puliafito “would return to his medical office to see patients within hours of using methamphetamine” and supplied drugs to Warren and her then-minor brother Charles Warren, among others. Puliafito provided Charles Warren with methamphetamine and pipes for smoking the drug when he was only 17, the filing said. Osinoff said Wednesday the doctor never illegally supplied drugs, was never high while seeing patients and has never been the subject of a patient complaint. He stopped using methamphetamine last July, he said.
The in-car delivery option, available to Amazon Prime members, is an attempt by Amazon to overcome the hesitation that many feel about remotely opening their homes for couriers. It's integrated with Amazon's Key service, launched last year to enable customers to automatically open doors for delivery people. Although the service has been touted as a way to reduce package theft, security concerns may still be an issue, as 69% of Americans say they wouldn't want to use Amazon Key to let couriers into their home, according to a survey by InsuranceQuotes.com.

Menlo Park resident Robin Tobias spotted this pretty petunia American flag while out on a run yesterday morning on Fairview Avenue in Atherton. The gardener, Michele Chandler, is from Creekside Landscaping in Menlo Park.
“She came out when I had stopped to look at this beautiful sight, and I was afraid she would question me,” reports Robin. “But instead she offered a big smile and an introduction and invited me to take a look. It was such a wonderful experience. I'm glad I stopped my run to see it!”
FILE PHOTO: David Letterman on stage during the 32nd Annual Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony Show in New York City, U.S., April 7, 201707/04/2017.
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - More than two years after signing off from "The Late Show," David Letterman is returning to television with a six-episode talk show on Netflix, and said that Pope Francis and U.S. President Donald Trump would be top of his wish-list.
Letterman, 70, will host the yet-to-be-titled series, which will feature interviews with "extraordinary people" and segments from the field "expressing his curiosity and humor," Netflix (NFLX.O), said in a statement. The show will premiere next year.
"Here's what I have learned, if you retire to spend more time with your family, check with your family first. Thanks for watching, drive safely," Letterman joked in a statement.
Known for his quick wit, sarcasm, offbeat humor and silly stunts, Letterman interviewed top stars and political figures on more than 6,000 episodes over 33 years in late-night television.
He told Hollywood trade paper Variety on Tuesday that he has one interview already booked for the first Netflix show but would not reveal the name.
"It's somebody who means a great deal to me," he said. "The upbringing of this person is so multi-faceted it makes your head spin."
Letterman said he was looking forward to doing weightier material and longer interviews than his "Late Show" format allowed.
"I'd like to talk to President Trump. I've known the guy for 25-30 years," he told Variety. "I'd like to go back to New York where he was a kid and start there. I'd like to just ask him about the change in him as a man, where did it come from, how did it begin and where is it going."
He said he would also like to interview Pope Francis.
Letterman, who has grown a large white beard since leaving "The Late Show" in May 2015, was succeeded on the CBS (CBS.N) show by Stephen Colbert.
Letterman is just the latest in a long line of big names to join the roster of Netflix's growing original content slate, which includes Chelsea Handler's weekly talk show "Chelsea."
The Letterman news comes a day after Netflix made its first acquisition, purchasing comics publisher Millarworld and bringing on board a host of character franchises it can mine for TV shows and movies.
Netflix last month reported second-quarter revenue of $2.79 billion and net income of $65.6 million.
Two men were killed when the minivan they were in collided with the back of a transport bus north of Fort McMurray Sunday evening.
Mounties said the crash on Highway 63 happened shortly after 5 p.m. at the top of what is known as Supertest Hill — a long, steep hill about 20 kilometres north of town.
RCMP were initially called to reports of a truck rear-ending a Diversified bus, however, officers arrived to find it was actually a 2009 Chrysler Town and Country minivan that hit the bus.
The minivan was driving south on Highway 63 from the Noralta Lodge exit, when it collided with a passenger bus at the top of the hill.

Both the 36-year-old man driving the minivan and his passenger were killed. Police said the male passenger, who has yet to be identified, is also believed to be in his 30s.
Mounties are working to identify him so they can notify the next of kin. Anyone who knows who may have been travelling in the 2009 Chrysler Town and Country minivan is asked to contact the Wood Buffalo RCMP at 780-788-4040.

The driver and 11 passengers of the Diversified bus have not reported any injuries to police.
Weather and alcohol appear to be factors in the crash, RCMP said. Traffic was down to one lane for several hours while police investigated the crash.
Hartlepool was the perfect place to shoot a new prime time comedy.
That's the view of the team who worked on the six-part Hospital People series, which will hit our screens on Friday.
The University Hospital of Hartlepool.
An unused area of the town's hospital and grounds were used as the set for the show, which will see its lead man Tom Binns take on four of its characters.
The show is set in the fictional town of Brimlington, but viewers will be able to spot familiar sights as aerial footage taken over the buildings, nearby homes and the coastline appears in the programmes.
Tom, who grew up in Sheffield but whose father comes from the region, said: “We looked for the best place and Hartlepool was it.
“Brimlington is more based on where I live, so between Derbyshire and Yorkshire, but on the coast, so it's a fictional place.
We looked for the best place and Hartlepool was it. Tom Binns
“Everybody who plays a character speaks in their own voice, but then everyone else has a North East accent because of where it was filmed.
“The hospital was absolutely amazing.
“Lots of our crew came from the North East and they couldn't believe their luck, so they didn't have to travel for hours and they had a great time.
“George Gently and Victoria have been filming there too, so it's growing.”

The mockumentary's makeup artist Jessica Downes and her brother Matt, a sound assistant, are from Hartlepool, while its producer Emma Lawson is from Sedgefield.
While in town the cast, brought together by Roughcut TV, formed a following of Mumbai Indian restaurant, with guest star Mark Williams among those to eat there.
Tom has performed as hospital DJ Ivan Brackenbury and medium Ian D Montfort for several years, with the pair joining characters hospital boss Susan Mitchell and Father Kenny in his repertoire.
For the role of Susan, he had to spend an hour in and also out of make up and he had to shave his head for the part of Fr Kenny.
Tom Binns's character DJ Ivan Brackenbury is one of the central figures in Hospital People.
Tom added: “The role of Ivan is one I've been playing for 25 years, so to go into his studio set inside the hospital was emotional.
“The best thing is the money from using the buildings goes straight back into the NHS.”
Hospital people, which also features stars including Russell Brand, Sally Phillps, Sian Gibson and James Fleet goes out on Friday at 9.30pm on BBC One.

Textures are striking. Anderson oscillates between matte and glossy glazes, in a spare palette of black, white and gold. The pieces, on pedestals and on the floor, marry an industrial look — contemporary, sturdy, spare — with ornate, baroque flamboyance. Sloppy craft may be a popular idiom these days, but Anderson opts instead for the pristine and immaculate, even as he draws from a hodgepodge of visual sources: the sprightly, cartoonish forms of the Japanese superflat aesthetic; the oversized frowning lips of blackface minstrelsy; offensive racial stereotypes and saccharine cuteness. Throughout his work, seduction consorts with repulsion, innocence with threat.
Less than a month in to the new administration, President Trump's national security advisor, Gen. Michael Flynn, has resigned after admitting that he misled his White House colleagues, including Vice President Mike Pence, about conversations he'd had with Russia's ambassador to Washington.
In those conversations, officials say, Flynn discussed sanctions that the Obama administration had imposed on Russia to punish Moscow for its interference in the U.S. election. Those conversations could have violated the Logan Act, which prevents unauthorized citizens from negotiating with foreign governments in relation to “disputes or controversies.” The law, however, which was enacted in the 1790s, has never been used to prosecute anyone.
Here's the timeline of events leading up to Flynn's resignation:
We are an unfortunate country who from its birth never saw an ideal situation of rule of law.
The cleverest, the most thuggish and most dishonest have ruled the country especially after 1999, when a military ruler took over and brought into his fold the famous looters and plunderers depoliticizing the mainstream society! New venues of corruption were opened as the money was pouring in after he sold both sovereignty and dignity of a nation to the USA and west in the back-drop of 9/11.
B.
B's elimination in 2007 was most disastrous and fateful incident happened to this unfortunate nation of 200 million people.
The USA and west now wanted to get rid of dictator and put into power civilian agents serving their personal interests, which were now fast becoming army-hostile.
Since 2008 they (USA and West) have managed to install the governments in the country both corrupt and inept while these civilian thugs were pushed by the USA and west to tease the military establishment.
Asif Zardari's Government avoided all that with cleverness as he got army chief of low stature whose own family members had then got indulged in obtaining dubious contracts and making money.
Secondly, Zardari being always fearful of courts did not resume any adventure against defense establishment so he greatly disappointed USA and west.
In year 2013 Sharif's assumed power in the Center and the formers found new players to work with their agenda against Military establishment.
Sharif's being comfortable with courts and bureaucracy, whom they found always on their side and with changing world scenario, thought it an appropriate opportunity to settle score with military establishment because of their outstation and humiliation in 1999.
The Sharif's tried to asset their position from the very beginning and attempted to cross the red line in the matters of defense and foreign policies but were rebuked indirectly by the real powers in the country.
Since these rulers were not directly resisted by military, they were encouraged and ultimately indulged in teasing the military establishment, through news article widely known as dawn-leaks.
This proved to be point of no return as Government's later avoidance to implement finding of Dawn-leaks inquiry added fuel to the fire which resulted that all the evidences of accumulating illegal money gathered against the Sharif's.
Apart from the corruption of ruling elite both in federation and provinces, the way the institutions are being run by their holders is more worrisome.
Pakistan is a democratic country, though with a farce democracy as many people call it, hence an elected Prime Minister is primarily supposed to be answerable to the masses who elect him.
The state institutions are the product of democratic system so they all are subservient to the will of people.
In Nawaz Sharif's case it became very evident that the court was predetermined to show him the doors which writing on the wall started reading by Nawaz Sharif as the case progressed both in the court and in JIT.
In this whole episode, the weaknesses of our system and especially apex courts have come to the forefront, which indicate that the country is heading towards destructive path not because of people but because of corrupt rulers and inept state institutions.
On the other hand, by acting on the behest of powerful and deciding the corruption and malpractices committed decades ago under the shadow of some special situation the justice system of the country has been exposed in many ways.
First, it seems to be always selective and situation-oriented; secondly, it is not across the board and would be used against certain people in certain situation and thirdly it can be used by the powerful whenever they need so.
Since rulers have failed the governance and democracy in the country and now with failing of our justice system, are we not fast heading towards anarchy?

Officials with the Coast Guard say a person is now being questioned by authorities about a potential threat at the Wando Terminal Wednesday night.
Coast Guard officials confirmed Thursday morning via Twitter four containers had been scanned and cleared. Fourteen agents with radiation detection technology investigated these containers and found no signs of radiation, officials said.
Officials have not yet released details about the person being questioned, but described the person as the "original source" of the threat in their tweet.
#update the original reporting source of the threat in port of Charleston has been detained by authorities for further questioning. — USCGSoutheast (@USCGSoutheast) June 15, 2017
The terminal will be reopened Thursday morning and a safety zone has been lifted.
Coast Guard officials say the FBI was called in to investigate a report of a "dirty bomb" aboard a vessel. A dirty bomb is composed of conventional explosives and radioactive material.
The potential threat had been reported at approximately 8 p.m. Wednesday involving a container aboard the vessel Maersk Memphis, according to a Coast Guard report.
"The Maersk Memphis is currently moored at Charleston's Wando terminal which has been evacuated while bomb detection units from federal, state and local law enforcement agencies investigate the threat," Coast Guard officials said.
The Coast Guard says a unified command was established to oversee the coordinated response. Agencies that responded include the Coast Guard, FBI, South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, Mount Pleasant Police, Mount Pleasant Fire, Charleston County Sheriff's Office, Charleston Port Authority, National Guard, SLED as well as Hazmat and EMS crews.
Workers said they were told to leave the terminal around 9 p.m.
Boaters say they were also escorted off the water due to the situation.

In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria, local residents Richard Rognlie and Kayla James-Rognlie of ‘Salty Dominica' approached the Rotary Club of Portsmouth with the idea to build a plastics shredder and an extrusion machine to help rid the environment of excessive plastic waste, including thousands of relief water bottles shipped to the island.
Salty Dominica and the Rognlies with the encouragement of the Rotary Club donated components for the shredder.
Several months into the effort Rory Dickens joined the effort. He had originally come to Dominica as part of the staff of the charity All Hands and Hearts, here to rebuild the Primary School in Paix Bouche.
Dickens had been working with the organization since 2015 in the Philippines, Ecuador, Peru, Nepal and the British Virgin Islands.
These various charitable endeavors led Dickens to see the importance in seeking entrepreneurial solutions to social problems.
Dickens, who received a Masters in Architecture from Robert Gordon University in Scotland, brought his design ingenuity to manufacturing an injection device largely out of scrap components found locally.
In April of this year he founded his own charitable foundation, Recycle Rebuild, which is an accredited SCIO in Scotland. It is through this organization that he formed a working partnership with the Rotary Club of Portsmouth to develop and build a plastics recycling facility utilizing the source design developed by David Hakkens Precious Plastics Global Initiative in Holland. This is an open source design resource available to communities.
The goal is to take Dominica's discarded plastic and turn it into usable and saleable items for the benefit of Dominicans. The Rotary Club of Portsmouth and Rory Dickens' Recycle Rebuild plan to have a pilot, which includes a shredder and injection molding machine functioning by the end of May.
The organizations will be seeking additional funding to establish a central recycling center in the Portsmouth area within the next six months at which point the product becomes for Dominicans and run by Dominicans.
RCMP are continuing their search for a missing Enoch Cree Nation man who has been missing since 2003, and they've released an age-progression photo.
William Jay Sharphead, known also as ‘Billy', went missing in September of 2003 and has not been heard from since. RCMP said that Sharphead was known to travel between the Edmonton area and Morley First Nation. His family continues to hope for Sharphead's safe return.
Sharphead, 50, is described as an Indigenous man with brown eyes and brown hair, standing 5'7” with a slim build.
More Canadian drivers than you think are getting busy behind the wheel, according to a new survey released Monday.
A report commissioned by Belair Direct found that 14 per cent of drivers “have engaged in romantic activities,” while three per cent have flossed behind the wheel.
It wasn't just extracurriculars that got Canadians in trouble: three out every 10 drivers admitted to running a red light and disobeying road signs.
Money proved to be just the incentive that drivers needed to fix up their habits. Four-fifths of drivers said they were willing to at least one bad habit if they knew they'd get paid for it. In B.C., that number went up significantly; 96 per cent of the province's drivers were willing to give up a bad habit in exchange for some cash.
On the more wholesome end of the scale, Canucks had some good habits too. Just over half of Canadians sing while driving and 96 per cent wouldn't steal another driver's parking spot.

U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar has introduced legislation to rename the U.S. Post Office in Beaverton after the late Col. Alfred Asch.
"Dad truly loved his hometown of Beaverton, Michigan and its people. It is where he laid his life's foundation," said David and Peter Asch, Alfred's sons. "Growing up in Beaverton he faced life's early challenges, overcame them and went on to take on the world. On his behalf and on behalf of the Asch family and citizens of Beaverton, we are thankful and proud to receive this high honor."
Asch grew up in Beaverton and served in the U.S. Army during World War II. He joined the Air Corps in 1941, flying two tours with the 93rd Bomb Group and 455th Bomb Group. Asch served through 1968, earning numerous decorations, including the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross with the Oak Leaf Cluster, the Purple Heart and two unit citations for the 93rd presented by King George II.
After retiring, Asch became a systems engineer with the Mitre Corp., where he spent 16 years developing automation for the air traffic control system of the Federal Aviation Administration. In 2013, he published his memoir, "The Whole Nine Yards," donating proceeds to the Beaverton Activities Center in his hometown. Previous publications included "The Story of the 455th" and the book of remembrance for the B-24 Monument dedication at the U. S. Air Force Academy.
"Col. Alfred Asch was a patriot who dedicated his life to serving the United States and defending the American people," Moolenaar said. "So it is my privilege to introduce legislation to honor his legacy and put his name on his hometown post office."
Everyone in cutting has a preferred draw. Some like a draw in the middle to see how the cows are working, and some like the later draw so they know exactly what they need to mark to win. A few also like the early draws, because any cow could be there's, but there is no denying the pressure that comes from going first.
The first draw sets the bar for the rest of the field and is the first to really test the herd. That first draw today at The Ike Derby and Classic proved to be the money spot, as the leading competitor in all four finals ended up with the Championship.
During the 4-Year-Old Unlimited Amateur finals, Alberto Rodriguez piloted Mo Metallic to a 217 to clinch the Championship. The title was worth $3,291, which pushed Jessica De Filippo's mare and Rodriguez to more than $10,000 in lifetime earnings.
Mo Metallic's other paychecks were earned with Rodriguez at the 2017 National Cutting Horse Association (NCHA) Futurity, where the pair advanced to the Unlimited Amateur and Limited Non-Pro semifinals and moved onto the finals in the Amateur.
The 2014 mare is by Equi-Stat Elite $17 Million Sire Metallic Cat, who won $637,711 in his cutting career. Mo Metallic is out of Mo Flo, who has nine performing offspring with money earned in cutting, barrel racing and reined cow horse. They have records totaling $176,237.
Her leading money earner is 2005 gelding, Metro Fletch (by Royal Fletch), who was a 2008 NCHA Futurity Open semifinalist and is an earner of nearly $115,000.
4-Year-Old Amateur
Marvin Marmande Jr. and Entirely Smoken had some tough luck at the 2017 National Cutting Horse Association (NCHA) Futurity that kept them from advancing to the Unlimited Amateur or Amateur finals, but they stayed focused going into the 2018 season.
As the first draw in the 4-Year-Old Amateur finals, the pair marked a 215 to clinch the Championship. The win was worth $1,538, which pushed Entirely Smoken's Equi-Stat record to $3,158. The gelding's other check to his credit was earned by advancing to the NCHA Futurity Unlimited Amateur semifinals.
Marmande, of Houma, Louisiana, now boasts lifetime earnings of more than $190,000. The homebred gelding is by Dual R Smokin, who has sired 49 money-earners with more than $450,000 to their credit. Dual R Smokin accumulated $220,727 in his cutting career.
Entirely Smoken is the only money-earner out of the 2008 mare Entirely Magic (by Abrakadrabracre) is out of Willys Tivio Dell, who has produced 13 performers with totals of $139,865.
Willys Tivio Dell's top money earners include, Tallic Cat (by Metallic Cat, $49,544), A Spoonfull of Wit (Hes A Peptospoonful, $23,033), One Spoonful of Tivi (Hes A Peptospoonful, $17,232).
5/6-Year-Old Unlimited Amateur
If an athlete takes a long hiatus from their sport of choice, it may be hard to get back to where they were before the break. But Amanda Standish has proved she never missed a beat after taking nearly a year off from cutting.
Standish was out of the saddle surrounding the birth of her daughter, Eloise, but she and Im Countin Starz picked up the Augusta Futurity 5/6-Year-old Unlimited Amateur Championship just a few weeks back and kept the success up at The Ike.
Standish and “Mr. Blue” took Reserve honors in the 5/6-Year-Old Non-Pro by marking a 219, and a day later, they put together another 219 to claim the 5/6-Year-Old Championship.
“It was really neat to win Augusta and then here,” Standish said. “I haven't shown for a year. I was really excited to do it. I was first, which always makes me a little nervous. I prefer to be a little bit deeper, but Austin [Shepard] had three really good cows picked out for me. They all shaped up and were pretty easy to cut. We got them cut clear, and they turned out to be great. He has been so much fun to show. If I do my job halfway right, he does everything else.”
Standish collected $11,181 for her Non-Pro Reserve Championship and an additional $3,766 for the Unlimited Amateur title. After her success at The Ike, Standish now boasts lifetime earnings of $182,148. Mr. Blue has an Equi-Stat record of more than $50,000.
The win was especially sweet because of Mr. Blue's connection to Standish's other prized performer. Out of Catrina Starlight (by High Brow Cat), he's a full brother to 2017 NCHA Open World Champion Deluxe Checks. Standish said she sees some distinct similarities between the two.
“They are both really honest horses and like to do their job,” Standish said. “It makes it easy to ride them and show them. They don't really think about how to get out of it or how not to do it. They pretty much do whatever you ask them to do. He [Mr. Blue] is a lot simpler than she is and easier to show, thought. He is extremely strait forward.”
Standish plans to take Mr. Blue to the NCHA Eastern Nationals, where both she and Shepard will ride him, and she is looking forward to what her year back of showing will bring.
5/6-Year-Old Amateur
Clinching any title at a cutting event is an exciting experience, but accomplishing that win after overcoming a difficult obstacle makes a Championship even sweeter.
When Mike Armstrong, of Marietta, Oklahoma, piloted Red Hot Metal to a 220 for The Ike 5/6-Year-Old Amateur title Armstrong was overjoyed, especially after thinking back on what he and “Red” had been through.
Red, who was bred by Fults Ranch, had to overcome a broken elbow when he was 2 years old to make it to where he is today. Caused by what was thought to be a direct kick, Red shattered his elbow in 3 places. After an extensive procedure, Red now functions a hitch with an 8-inch long plate and 14 screws on that joint.
Armstrong said he has been sound ever since his six-month recovery following that procedure, but his accomplishments in the cutting pen with Red (Metallic Cat x Spots Hot Shot x Spots Hot) are a direct result of his help at shows.
“We were holding our breath with him, because we couldn't really touch him for six months after [his surgery],” Armstrong said. “He was on stall rest for that long, and we just hoped it would heal OK. He has been rock solid and never had a lame step since.
“I had great help today. They put me onto the right cow, and the horse was good. I cut whatever they tell me to cut. I leave the cow picking to the guys who do it the best.”
Armstrong is thrilled with the result of the finals at The Ike, especially because the win, worth $1,670 pushed Red to nearly $50,000 in lifetime earnings.
“It has been a real great journey with him,” Armstrong said. “I will keep going with him.”

Source: Government mulls NOCZIM revival | The Financial Gazette April 13, 2017
GOVERNMENT is mulling a merger between the National Infrastructure Company of Zimbabwe (NOIC) and Petrotrade, which could result in the resuscitation of the National Oil Company of Zimbabwe (NOCZIM), unbundled seven years ago to create the two entities.
The planned merger was revealed by Energy and Power Development Minister, Samuel Undenge, on Wednesday last week when he was asked by Binga North Member of Parliament, Prince Sibanda, why his ministry had created a new fuel retail firm, Genesis, when government already owned Petrotrade.
He told Parliament that discussions on the planned merger were already underway, highlighting that government intended “to achieve the advantages of economies of scale” by merging the two businesses.
NOIC provides bulk transportation, storage and handling of petroleum products to meet the country's fuel requirements while Petrotrade is a trading company responsible for downstream activities, including the selling of petroleum products and lubricants through bulk sales and service stations.
NOIC has storage facilities with a capacity to carry over 500 million litres at its depots across the country. The company has five depots in Mutare, Bulawayo and Beitbridge, Msasa and Mabvuku. It transports petroleum products by pipeline from the port of Beira in Mozambique into Zimbabwe on behalf of its customers.
Oil from Beira is pumped through a 408-kilometre pipeline, which was built in 1966. It passes through the Feruka Oil Refinery in Mutare to Harare.
Its major customers are oil importers who get products from Beira for use in Zimbabwe and in the southern African region.
Zimbabwe imports about 2,5 million litres of diesel and 1,5 million litres of petrol daily. The fuel sector is the biggest consumer of foreign currency in the country.
The company is strategically positioned to provide logistic services for effective re-export of fuel into regional markets such as Zambia, Botswana and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Apart from this, the company also undertakes blending services on behalf of its clients after government directed petroleum players to blend all petrol.
NOIC has been operating profitably, consistently declaring dividends to its shareholder since 2013.
Last year, NOIC declared a US$4 million dividend to government for the 12 months to December 31 2015. This came as a result of a 37 percent increase in profits.
Petrotrade also declared a dividend last year to government amounting to US$225 000 after posting a US$1,8 million net profit for the year to December 2015.
Petrotrade has been without a board for two years, another issue that concerned legislators.
In order to know more about the planned merger, Parliament has asked Undenge to prepare a ministerial statement answering questions around the amalgamation, which most legislators consider to be surprising considering that both Petrotrade and NOIC have been making profits since their unbundling from NOCZIM.
The unbundling process was overseen by former Movement for Democratic Change deputy treasurer, Elton Mangoma, who was then minister of energy during the inclusive government.
A similar plan to unbundle the country's power utility, ZESA Holdings, was scuttled by former energy minister, Dzikamai Mavhaire, following the collapse of the inclusive government in 2013 after ZANU-PF romped to a landslide victory to form the current government.
Mavhaire, who was sacked from both government and the ruling party following a purge of former vice president Joice Mujuru and her allies, alleged that the plan to unbundle ZESA was part of a scheme to destroy the parastatal, which however was beleaguered by allegations of political interference and abuse of funds to support ZANU-PF projects during his tenure.
The then clerk of Parliament, Austin Zvoma, had been forced to hurriedly write to the Registrar of the High Court and the chief secretary to the President and Cabinet demanding the return of the Electricity Amendment Act 2013 which sought to unbundle ZESA into what was described as “an indeterminate number of privately-owned successor companies”.
Mangoma was said to be plotting to “effectively put the critical power sector into the hands of unknown Western investors” through the unbundling exercise.
It was not immediately clear if government's plan to resuscitate NOCZIM was being informed by the same thinking that resulted in the abortion of ZESA's unbundling.
NOCZIM, a corruption-ridden parastatal that was blighted by massive looting and mismanagement, faced many problems since 2002 when government de-regularised the procurement of petroleum products in a move that saw private players coming on board.
The parastatal then embarked on a programme to diversify its operations, venturing into other projects outside its core business such as horticulture and the controversial jatropha plantations.
These were later abandoned after they proved unprofitable, forcing NOCZIM to revert to its core business of importing and distributing fuel.
Before the creation of the Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority, NOCZIM was also a regulator of the fuel sector.
The parastatal struggled to supply the market with fuel, forcing government to break its monopoly in the importation of fuel and eventually unbundling the entity to form NOIC and Petrotrade.

One of the (many) things that makes the Trump presidency so hard to read is that the chapters are all out of order.
Traditionally, during the transition period, presidents-elect are out of the limelight. But while Barack Obama was still in the White House, Donald Trump announced “deals” and appointments that made it seem like he was already in office, hitting the ground running to Make America Great Again. On the entirely subjective calculus of wins, he probably had more before his inauguration than any president.
Conversely, the first 100 days are supposed to be a time of big domestic legislative achievements. Instead, they've looked more like the lame-duck period of a president's second term.
Once sworn in, rather than get a political honeymoon with the news media, Trump had an angry divorce. And instead of giving Trump a big gift-wrapped box of legislation, Congress has mostly given him the sorts of headaches presidents have to deal with when they've lost their clout.
What happens when the list of easy wins runs out?
The White House is touting its raft of executive orders as proof that things are getting done and promises are being kept. That's a fair spin. Trump campaigned on repealing a slew of Obama's executive orders and other “job-killing” regulations.
But that doesn't change the fact that presidents usually turn to executive orders when getting big stuff through Congress is impossible and to prove they still have their mojo. Hence Obama's famous quip in 2014 that he still had “a pen and a phone.”
There's another thing presidents famously do in their second terms, when Congress isn't interested in the president's agenda: retreat to foreign policy. Ronald Reagan concentrated on dealing with the Soviets. Bill Clinton focused on peace negotiations in Northern Ireland and the Middle East and his air war in the former Yugoslavia. George W. Bush launched the surge in Iraq, gave a shot at Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and initiated a massive humanitarian effort to fight AIDS in Africa. Obama's second term was dominated by his obsession with getting a nuclear deal with Iran.
And now President Trump, early in his first term, is trying the same trick. That's because, according to numerous reports from inside the shockingly leaky White House (another feature of lame duck presidencies, when staffers look to their own political future) Trump is eager for “wins.” As Trump advisor Larry Kudlow told the Washington Post, “The president wants Ws — he wants wins.”
His biggest “W” to date was the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, which came when he turned to seasoned pros who know how to get things done in Washington, namely Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society. His other big ”W” was his missile strike on Syria, for which he also had seasoned pros to thank: Defense Secretary James N. Mattis and national security advisor Gen. H.R. McMaster.
It's early yet, but that strike, combined with his authorization of a massive bomb drop on an alleged Islamic State compound in Afghanistan, has yielded other apparent foreign policy Ws. China seems to be cooperating in the administration's effort to squeeze the North Korean regime. Domestically, these moves succeeded in sucking some of the oxygen out of the media's feeding frenzy over allegations that Trump's campaign colluded with Russia and claims that he is a “puppet” of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It seems a fair guess that Trump's response will be, “more please.” As Fox News anchor Bret Baier recently put it, Trump is “not that ideological. He is more practical and he is looking for Ws, wins. If you turn to the Pentagon and say, ‘give me some wins,' they have got a long list of things that can produce Ws.”
Trump's sudden transformation into a foreign policy president isn't necessarily sinister. Obama's policy of “strategic patience” and “leading from behind” left a lot of low-hanging fruit for Trump to pluck.
The question is, what happens when the list of easy Ws runs out? There's little evidence that Trump is operating with a coherent strategic vision, which means that he won't have a thought-out criterion for knowing when to say no to the generals he clearly admires. For a true lame duck president, that may not matter — when the Ws run out, he's out of office. For a first-term president who just acts like a lame duck president, it's another story.

A suicide bomber driving a pickup loaded with explosives struck a bustling market in Baghdad on Monday, killing at least 36 people in an attack claimed by the Islamic State group hours after French President Francois Hollande arrived in the Iraqi capital.
The bomb went off in a fruit and vegetable market that was packed with day labourers, a police officer said, adding that another 52 people were wounded.
During a press conference with Hollande, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said the bomber pretended to be a man seeking to hire day labourers. Once the workers gathered around, he detonated the vehicle.

IS claimed the attack in a statement circulated on a militant website often used by the extremists. It was the third IS-claimed attack in as many days in and around Baghdad, underscoring the lingering threat posed by the group despite a string of setbacks elsewhere in the country over the past year, including in and around the northern city of Mosul.
The attack took place in Sadr City, a vast Shiite district in eastern Baghdad that has been repeatedly targeted by Sunni extremists since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.
Shiite militiamen loyal to Muqtada al-Sadr, the firebrand cleric for whose family the neighbourhood is named, were seen evacuating bodies in their trucks before ambulances arrived. Dead bodies were scattered across the bloody pavement alongside fruit, vegetables and labourers' shovels and axes. A minibus filled with dead passengers was on fire.

Asaad Hashim, an owner of a mobile phone store nearby, described how the labourers pushed and shoved around the bomber's vehicle, trying to get hired.
“Then a big boom came, sending them up into the air,” said the 28-year old, who suffered shrapnel wounds to his right hand. He blamed “the most ineffective security forces in the world” for failing to prevent the attack.
An angry crowd cursed the government, even after a representative of al-Sadr tried to calm them. Late last month, Iraqi authorities started removing some of the security checkpoints in Baghdad in a bid to ease traffic for the capital's 6 million residents.

“We have no idea who will kill at any moment and who's supposed to protect us,” said Ali Abbas, a 40-year old father of four who was hurled over his vegetable stand by the blast. “If the securities forces can't protect us, then allow us to do the job,” he added.
Three smaller bombings elsewhere in the city on Monday killed another seven civilians and wounded at least 30, according to medics and police officials. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters.
Hollande meanwhile met with al-Abadi and President Fuad Masum, and was expected to travel to the self-governing northern Kurdish region to meet French troops and local officials.

Iraqi troops, backed by a U.S.-led coalition, are fighting IS in a massive operation to retake the northern city of Mosul. Iraqi state TV said Hollande will discuss increasing support for Iraq and the latest developments in the 10-week-old offensive.
Hollande promised that France would remain a long-term ally of Iraq and called for co-ordination between intelligence services “in a spirit of great responsibility,” in remarks carried by his official Twitter account.
France is part of the American-led coalition formed in 2014 to fight IS after the extremist group seized large areas in Iraq and neighbouring Syria. France has suffered multiple attacks claimed by the extremist group.

Since the Mosul operation started on Oct. 17, Iraqi forces have seized around a quarter of the city. Last week, the troops resumed fighting after a two-week lull due to stiff resistance by the militants and bad weather.
Mosul is Iraq's second largest city and the last major urban area in the country controlled by IS. Iraqi and U.S. commanders hope to drive IS from the city in the next three months.
DAVIE, Fla. -- Chances don't appear great that Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill could return from a sprained ACL and MCL in his left knee for this weekend's playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Editor's Picks Dolphins must have a short memory, focus on Steelers After Sunday's loss to the Patriots, it's time for the Dolphins to quickly turn the page and focus on their playoff opponent: the Pittsburgh Steelers.
But as of Monday, coach Adam Gase isn't ruling out the possibility.
"I don't want to say yes or no," Gase said during his news conference. "The guy, as you guys all know, is a freak of nature. ... His body is unique, and the way he heals is the same way. We'll kind of take it one step at a time."
Gase said he plans to get a firm update on Tannehill's knee from the team's medical staff late Monday or early Tuesday. An important part of the decision will come down to whether Tannehill is healthy enough to practice, which he hasn't done since missing the past three games.
Tannehill has spent all his time since the injury rehabbing and strengthening his knee. From the sideline, he also helped players during practice and games.
"I need to know what his movement skills are, where we are as far as the structure of his knee and things like that," Gase said. "Once I get that update, I will have a better idea of what we're going to do moving forward."
Backup quarterback Matt Moore has been solid in place of Tannehill. Moore is 2-1 as a starter and has thrown for 721 yards with eight touchdowns, three interceptions and a 105.6 quarterback rating.
The tricky part is weighing the short- and long-term risks of playing Tannehill as the quarterback's knee gets healthier each week. According to Gase, the decision is not expected to be made at game time. Moore and Tannehill have different skills and styles of play, which will affect Miami's offensive game plan in Sunday's high-stakes playoff game against the Steelers.
"It'd be an option, but I'd doubt it," Gase said. "You need to know where he's at. I'm going to have to feel really good about this."

In the ongoing late-night wars over which talk show host is most tolerable consistently, Seth Meyers has had the pack beat for about two years now. In facing the unending idiocy and horror of the Trump administration, no other host has seemingly been able to communicate his anger, fear, and sheer amazement over what's been happening in Washington D.C. while not losing sight of how to make a joke rather than simply sarcastically point to research that makes clear the wild hypocrisy and greed of the current Republican party. Even Stephen Colbert, a brilliant comedian, hasn't been able to quite get over his fury and disbelief enough to make big, bold jokes about our current state of chaotic governing.
Still, it can't all be about politics all the time, and even in the irreverent category of late-night segments, Meyers and his writers' room have been exceedingly inventive. This was once again highlighted last night, when Meyers asked “Since U Been Gone” singer and inaugural American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson to go day drinking with him for a Late Night with Seth Meyers segment. As you might have guessed, it climaxes with an inebriated duet of the aforementioned hit, but the talk beforehand about Trump and a drink called “The Blake Shelton” was just as goofy and entertaining in an overall light way. You can check out the clip below.
Meyers' secret weapon has always been his willingness to be embarrassingly open about his love for certain pop culture totems, including Clarkson's song, but he also clearly learned many lessons from Jon Stewart. Like the former, much-missed Daily Show host, Meyers is a hesitant optimist who is also quick to admit when cynicism has won the day for one reason or another. As you might have guessed, the last two years or so have involved numerous cases where Meyers had to simply embrace pessimism to be honest about what's going on in this country or abroad. It makes clips like this one all the more lively, considering the fact that Monday will likely bring some fresh American hell to commiserate about with his audience.
Here's the clip from Last Night with Seth Meyers:

LAHORE - To pass the bill of prerequisite education of Holy Quran with translation from grade one to Intermediate is the historic accomplishment of federal and provincial governments, Punjab Education Minister Rana Mashhood said on Wednesday.
According ot a press release, he expressed these views while addressing a ceremony organised by Punjab Curriculum and Textbook Board (PCTB) with reference to the compulsory education of Holy Quran in schools.
PCTB MD Abdul Qayyum, PEC Chief Executive Rao Muhammad Aslam, Additional Director Syed Mubashar Hussain and DPI Schools' Mumtaz Shah were also present at this occasion. The education minister indicated that it has been made possible by the joint efforts of school education and Punjab Assembly to implement the education of Quran with translation. He commented that the provincial Secretary Education and PCTB Chairperson Lt Gen (R) Myhammad Akran Khan and PCTB MD Abdul Qayyum must be congratulated in this regard.
“This program has been initiated as a pilot program from Bahalwapur. The education of Quran with translation will help minimise the issue of sectarianism and will encourage mutual cooperation and national solidarity,” he said, adding that Quranic education will become a source of character building and guidance to the young generation with modern education.
Rana Mashood said that according to PCTB Act 2015, the publishing and selling of books without the prior consent of PCTB is a serious offence and Punjab Textbook Board is much vigilant in this regard.
Noted Islamic scholar Maulana Muhammad Hussain Akbar remarked that it is a great work to enforce the education of Quran according to the constitution. He indicated that today's ceremony in this respect is of great importance and value. He said: “Surely the Book of Allah should be our guide.”–PR
The New Brunswick government is making Medicare available to international students studying at the province's post-secondary institutions.
Students with valid study permits who are registered full-time for the entire school year, as well as their spouses and dependents, will be eligible for coverage.

The province's post-secondary education minister, Roger Melanson, says the move will help New Brunswick recruit more international students.
“This will help address additional out-of-pocket expenses international students face when studying in New Brunswick,” Melanson said in a news statement.
Robert Burroughs, the executive director of the New Brunswick Student Alliance, told reporters on Friday that students are happy to have the changes finalized.

“Over the past eight months, it's been that limbo of the government had announced its intent but they were working through regulatory changes. And then we got those changes that have been approved by cabinet and now we can go ahead full steam,” he said.
Burroughs says the change also sends a “powerful message” to international students, who up until this point, spent an average of $1,000 on insurance costs.
“International students have been looking at what is their role here in New Brunswick, what is their place in New Brunswick when they come study here,” he said.
“That sense of belonging, that sense of community, that sense of ‘I do belong here and I'm a functioning member of New Brunswick' and I'm treated as such. That's really been addressed by this.”

In order to receive Medicare coverage, students must submit proof of full-time enrolment in a post-secondary institution, a valid permit from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and documentation showing their date of arrival in the province.

Connecticut Better Business Bureau urges consumers and businesses to begin digital spring cleaning. The safety of your personal and financial information can be stolen by hackers.
Identity theft is one of consumers' leading concerns, with good reason. Recovering from ID theft can be a long, complex and potentially costly ordeal, something to consider this Saturday, which is Secure Your ID Day.
You may have unknowingly downloaded free software or gone on a site that slips a virus into your computer. They can steal your contacts, learn all of your logins and passwords and discover your bank's, doctor's or dentist's contact information, which can help them to get you to reveal personal information by telephone or email.
Connecticut Better Business Bureau spokesman Howard Schwartz says we can lose all of our files, even if our computers are clean of malware.
“Hard drives have a limited lifespan and can suddenly corrupt your files. A mechanical problem such a crash may ruin your storage disk, and if you lose or drop your laptop or it is lost or stolen, all of your cherished photos, videos, emails and documents will be gone.”
BBB tips for digital spring cleaning
Keep software up to date — Those patches and updates often close security vulnerabilities. Install/apply operating system and software patches as soon as possible.
Back up your files — Storage drives are inexpensive and in a few minutes you will have copies of all of your files and other media so that if you get hacked, or if your computer is lost or stolen, you will still have those files.
Secure smart devices — Your smartphone, tablet and all digital storage devices should be protected by a password and contain tracking software to enable you to find a lost or stolen device.
Lock the “digital doors” with software — Antivirus software is of little use if you don't keep it updated and scan your device weekly for malware. If you don't use your computer often, update and scan before you go online.
Fix your passwords — Millions of passwords and logins have been stolen in data breaches, and victims of computer-based fraud often admit they use the same password for multiple accounts, or a password that is easy to guess. Often, information contained in people's passwords are taken from social media profiles, such as pet names or the names of family members.
Experts recommend a combination of upper and lower case letters, numerals and a symbol. Free password management software is available online. It can generate strong passwords, store them and log you in to your favorite sites automatically.

Members of the Saskatoon Fire Department were called to a school bus fire in the Adelaide/Churchill neighbourhood on Tuesday afternoon.
A report of the blaze on Macdermid Crescent came in at around 4:05 p.m. CT.
Upon arrival, crews found the bus engulfed in flames.
Fire department officials said all four children on the bus at the time were safely evacuated by the driver to a nearby home.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and their would-be partners, the Social Democrats (SPD), have made major progress in talks on forming a coalition government but remain at odds on issues like labour rules, a senior SPD member said on Friday.
As he emerged from lengthy talks that Merkel hopes will ultimately secure her fourth term and end political impasse in Europe's largest economy, SPD General Secretary Lars Klingbeil said the parties had taken a “leap forward.”
“But we also saw that we have differences on some topics,” he said.
Senior conservative Peter Altmaier said Friday's talks had been good and the parties were optimistic but a “very tough stretch of road” lay ahead.
The parties became embroiled in another dispute over migration on Friday, with some SPD members saying they wanted to revisit January's coalition blueprint that said the parties did not expect annual migration to exceed 220,000 per year because they were annoyed that Merkel's CSU Bavarian allies seemed to be considering this as an upper limit.
But SPD deputy Ralf Stegner later said the parties had reached a deal. In an apparent defeat for the SPD, the wording of that migration prediction remained the same - as pushed for by the CSU, which calls for a migrant cap.
Stegner said the figure described “expected migration numbers” and beyond that the parties stood by the right to asylum enshrined in Germany's constitution.
He said the SPD had to make compromises: “We can't make progress on our issues without giving something in return.”
But he trumpeted an agreement on a “modern and transparent immigration law” as a success for the migrant-friendly SPD. The parties agreed to encourage skilled migration using criteria such as qualifications, age and language skills.
The two camps aim to finalise a deal for four more years of a “grand coalition” by the end of the weekend or early next week, some four months after an inconclusive election plunged Germany into unaccustomed political uncertainty.
But Merkel said, upon arriving for talks, that they faced divisions in crucial areas, adding: “We have goodwill to overcome them, but there is still a lot of work ahead for us.”
The parties have agreed some eye-catching measures, including a 50 percent tax write-down for fleet electric cars and a 12-billion-euro public investment programme to improve sluggish data networks, documents seen by Reuters showed.
In the field of labour rights, where the SPD wants to signal to its members that it has set its stamp on the deal, the SPD and conservatives agreed to the right for employees in companies with more than 45 employees to move seamlessly back and forth between full- and part-time work.
But long lines of text highlighted in yellow showed the parties had yet to decide on the exact wording of that agreement.
PROGRESS
Other agreements included to raise child benefits by 25 euros per child per month. Senior SPD member Katarina Barley said there would be a women's quota for management in the civil service after the last government focussed on this for firms.
The parties also agreed to give German authorities the ability to deprive people with dual citizenship of their German citizenship if they fight abroad for an extremist organisation.
They said they wanted to start allowing collective lawsuits. Consumer associations and politicians had called for class-action lawsuits to be made possible during the Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal.
As he arrived for talks, SPD leader Martin Schulz said his party would insist on more progress in labour law and healthcare, where the party hopes to reduce differences in the service experienced by the privately and publicly insured.
They made some progress by agreeing to boost funds for hospitals for restructuring, digitalisation and new technologies.
The centre-left SPD has sagged further in polls since suffering its worst postwar result in the Sept. 24 election.
Many SPD activists, who must ratify any coalition deal in a postal ballot, would prefer to see their party reinvent itself in opposition rather than join another coalition with Merkel after serving as junior partner from 2013 to 2017.
Several politicians from both blocs suggested they may need until Monday and Tuesday to reach an agreement, with Schulz stressing they were not under time pressure. But Horst Seehofer, Merkel's Bavarian ally, said: “So far, there is no reason to expect we will need longer than Sunday.”
ISLAMABAD - The row over the ‘findings of report' firmed up by an inquiry commission about the DawnLeaks could widen the gulf between the civil and military leadership.
The controversy continues over the findings of the report about the DawnLeaks largely, a breach of security following the claims and counter claims about findings of the report which is yet to be made public.
Director General Military's media wing Inter Services Public Relations Major General Asif Ghafoor on Monday dismissed the claim earlier made by Interior Minister Chuadhry Nisar Ali Khan about the findings of the report.
“There was no talk about consensus. The commission had agreed on some steps required to identify the culprits”, Maj. Gen Asif responded to a question during a press briefing on Monday.
However, he said since the interior minister has already stated about the timeframe of the report he would get, it is better to wait.
“Now let us see a decision would soon come”, he hoped.
On the other hand, Interior Minister Chaudhary Nisar Ali Khan issued a rejoinder in the same evening saying he stands by his statement about the DwanLeaks he has talked about on April 15.
In his rejoinder, the interior minister reiterated that the delay in firming up recommendations by the inquiry commission was due to lack of consensus.
“The DG ISPR has neither any connection with the inquiry commission, nor he was DG ISPR when the inquiry commission was constituted,” Nisar said.
He went on to say that the head of the inquiry commission Justice (retd) Amir Raza Khan had agreed to head the commission on the condition that he would sign the report of the commission only when all the members will have consensus.
“Had all the members of the inquiry commission reached consensus over the recommendations at the earliest, the commission would not have taken more than five months in compiling its final report”, the interior minister said.
Nisar on Saturday last had said that the DawnLeaks inquiry commission members have developed consensus over the report and it will be presented to the Ministry of Interior "within the next few days."
Addressing a press conference, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said that Ministry of Interior would receive Dawn Leaks commission report within the next two or three days.
"The report would be forwarded to the government after the interior ministry receives it and the media would be briefed accordingly." He said on March 16 last there was disagreement among the members of the commission which caused the delay.
In a related development, a member of the inquiry commission has claimed that Dawn leaks report may not be made public in the coming days as promised by the Interior Minister Chaudhary Nisar Ali Khan.
He told The Nation on the condition of anonymity that the report is yet to be signed by the members.
Official sources revealed that the Prime Minister's Office and members of federal cabinet had approached the committee's few members during the hearing of DawnLeaks case and preparation of the report.
They said the committee had finalized its findings but the report was delayed because the stakeholders could not reach consensus about the recommendations. They are divided about giving recommendations either to punish the people involved or give them minor penalties, the sources said.
The federal government had constituted a committee to investigate the source behind the October 6 Dawn newspaper story to complete the job within 30 days but the deadline was extended twice to compile the report.
Earlier, the Press Council of Pakistan jumped into the DawnLeaks controversy and its chairman Dr M Salahud Din Mengal raised objection over the formation of probe committee without the input of PCP. He said the probe committee should focus on the person who had leaked the information instead of asking the reporter to tell the source of information.

Punjab Chief Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif has said that the journey of progress and prosperity, while continue in the year 2017.
While talking to a delegation of PML-N, Shehbaz said that there will be politics of progress of the country and prosperity of the people in 2017 and it is the year of completion of promises and projects. He said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, the rapid development made in different sectors during last year in the tenure of PML-N government is unprecedented. Development projects including energy projects are being executed speedily with high standard, he added.
Shehbaz Sharif said that various projects are also being completed rapidly under China Pakistan Economic Corridor. He said that work is being carried out round the clock on 1320-Megawatt Coal Power Project in Sahiwal and it will be completed in the beginning of next year. He said that there will be politics of only progress and prosperity and not agitation and anarchy.
People wanted to create hurdles in the development and prosperity of the people and the country through jugglery will fail in future like before, he added. The Chief Minister said that conscious people of Pakistan, by renouncing protest politics, have exposed a handful of political elements and the politics of allegations, lies and protests has died its own death. He said that the people wanted to create hurdles in the way of progress and prosperity of the masses have become politically isolated. There is a need for enemies of progress and prosperity to review their attitude, he added.
He said that people of Pakistan want only progress, prosperity and peace. Shehbaz Sharif said that there is no value of personal interests before the interests of Pakistan and PML-N has always done the politics of norms. He said that all have to move jointly for the development and prosperity of the country and achieve the lost destiny of the nation. He said that 2017 will be the year of completion of projects.
A 3-month-old British baby's trip to Orlando, Fla., had to be postponed after his grandfather accidentally labeled him a terrorist.
Paul Kenyon was due to fly across the pond with his grandson, Harvey Kenyon-Cairns, but he made a mistake on the baby's visa waiver form.
One of the ‘yes' or ‘no' questions asked, “Do you seek to engage in or have you ever engaged in terrorist activities, espionage, sabotage, or genocide?”, to which Kenyon accidentally checked ‘yes'.

The family learned of the error when Harvey's travel was denied.
“I couldn't believe that they couldn't see it was a genuine mistake and that a three-month-old baby would be no harm to anyone,” Kenyon told the Guardian.
The family was forced to drive 10 hours from Poynton, Cheshire to the U.S. embassy in London for questioning.

“Baby Harvey was good as gold for the interview and never cried once. I thought about taking him along in an orange jumpsuit, but thought better of it,” said Kenyon. “They didn't appear to have a sense of humour over it at all and couldn't see the funny side.
“He's obviously never engaged in genocide, or espionage, but he has sabotaged quite a few [diapers] in his time, though I didn't tell them that at the U.S. embassy.”
While the situation was resolved with the trip to London, it was not cleared up in time for the family's initial trip so they were forced to spend $5,000 for new tickets for Harvey and his parents.
“It was a very expensive mistake, but I was hoping the U.S. embassy would realize that it was just a simple error without us having to jump through all the hoops,“ Kenyon told the Telegraph.
“If you are a terrorist, I suspect you'd not be ticking YES on the ESTA form anyway.”

NEW YORK — Thousands of protesters and heavy security were ready to greet President Donald Trump as he headed for his home in the city on Monday for the first time since his inauguration.
Demonstrators stood in pens that police erected across the street from Trump Tower in Manhattan and lined nearby blocks of Fifth Avenue by early Monday evening, hours before his expected arrival. So did a far smaller crowd of Trump supporters.
Some protesters carried signs with such messages as “impeach” and “the White House is no place for white supremacy” as chants including “not my president” and “love, not hate — that's what makes America great” rose above traffic noise. Nearby, an inflatable, rat-like caricature of Trump stood by The Plaza hotel.

The Rev. Jan Powell, a retired minister of the United Church of Christ, carried a sign that read “No justice, no peace” as she stood opposite Trump's signature tower.
She said she was bothered by the Republican president's response to the white supremacist rally that descended into violence Saturday in Virginia. But “what bothers me the most is when folks like Trump try to silence our First Amendment right to free speech, either with violence or ‘fake news' or hate speech,” Powell said.

Still, she said, “I pray for him every day. We are both human beings.”
City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, a Democrat, was among the protesters.
Meanwhile, about two dozen Trump fans were in a separate pen near The Plaza, chanting “God bless President Trump” and carrying American flags.

“Now is not the time for divisiveness,” read one of their signs.
With anti-Trump demonstrators penned across the sidewalk, both sides yelled at each other, “Go home!”
WATCH: Analyzing Trump's response to Charlottesville
A block south of Trump Tower, police officers with bullhorns confronted protesters pressing against and straining the barricades, telling the demonstrators to step back.
Police had stationed sand-filled sanitation trucks as barriers around Trump's signature skyscraper and layers of metal police barricades around the main entrance.
READ MORE: Why has Charlottesville been the location of several white nationalist rallies?
After Trump was elected president Nov. 8, security around the tower ramped up dramatically. Barricades and checkpoints were manned by scores of uniformed police officers. The security precautions have been lessened somewhat in Trump's absence but still have inconvenienced residents and business owners in the highly trafficked area, home to stores such as Tiffany and Louis Vuitton.
Trump, a native New Yorker who cherishes his namesake high-rise, said Friday that he had stayed away because he realized the impact of the street closings and other aspects of a presidential visit.
“I would love to go to my home in Trump Tower, but it's very, very disruptive to do,” he said.
Protester Gabby Parra, however, said she was demonstrating to show Trump “he's not welcome here.”
“We need to let him know that New Yorkers and people from around here are not going to accept his blatant idiocy,” said Parra, a 17-year-old high school senior from Teaneck, New Jersey.
She said she feels the president dehumanizes minorities, noting that he launched his campaign by portraying Mexico as a source of rapists and murderers coming into the U.S. and that he initially failed to denounce white supremacists specifically after Saturday's violence.
Trump, under pressure after initially condemning what he called an “egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides,” on Monday declared that “racism is evil” and described members of the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and white supremacists who take part in violence as “criminals and thugs.”
"While I have tried to work through it, the last thing I want is for it to affect the team," his statement said. "I am going to use this time to focus on a prescribed routine and medication, which has previously been difficult to start in the midst of a season. My goal is to come out of it a stronger and healthier version of myself so I can continue to lead this team to the Championship we are all working towards."

Samsung Electronics continues to make investments in foreign artificial intelligence technology businesses, especially focusing on Chinese firms, according to sources Monday.The South Korean tech behemoth recently invested $20 million in Vion Technologies, a Chinese AI firm specializing in machine vision, in partnership with Swiss automation company ABB, Chinese venture firm Tsing Capital and Hong Kong's Waterwood, reported a Chinese news outlet.Vion Technologies is an AI solutions and product provider that specializes in smart cities and business intelligence. The company is famous for its smart camera used for capturing images of traffic violations, as well as a video analysis terminal capable of recognizing faces and age via monitors.The Chinese firm's focus is known as machine vision, or technology to provide image-based automatic inspection and analysis.Samsung's chipmaking division has been working on machine vision technology in coordination with IBM.Last year, Samsung unveiled a machine vision platform based on IBM's TrueNorth processor, a chip designed to operate like the human brain to process digital imagery at a fast rate.“Machine vision, more widely known as computing vision, is one of the key areas of AI, along with voice recognition and translation,” said Chang Joon-hyuk, a professor at Hanyang University. “Securing the technology will be crucial for implementing virtual reality programs on smartphones, recognizing images on devices and further for autonomous driving programs.”Samsung declined to confirm facts regarding the latest investment, saying, “The company's investment entities that are based in the US are independently making investments in tens of different foreign businesses, including the Chinese companies, which is hard to keep track of at the headquarters level.”According to the industry, the latest investment in Beijing-based Vion Technologies is interpreted as a follow-up measure of Samsung's launch of $300 million Automotive Innovation Fund in September.At the time, Samsung announced the new fund would invest to secure technologies related to connected cars, including smart sensors, machine vision, artificial intelligence and security.Industry observers note that Samsung has been recently expanding investments in AI businesses to catch up with advanced global players, particularly in Chinese companies, including fledgling startups.Less than a year after the Korean company invested $30 million in British AI chip firm Graphcore in October 2016, Samsung provided $40 million for China's Tsinghua-based Deephi Tech in August as a partner company.More recently, Samsung acquired Korean AI startup Fluenty last month, an announcement that was made after the company created an AI center under Samsung Research earlier in November, which was read by industry watchers to enhance its AI capabilities by integrating the formerly separated hardware and software R&D institutes.By Song Su-hyun (song@heraldcorp.com)
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's HNA Group said on Wednesday that Wang Jian, a chairman and co-founder, died during a business trip in France on July 3 after a serious injury caused by a fall.

HNA, one of China's most acquisitive conglomerates which has been selling assets to slash debt, said that Wang, 57, suffered a fall in Provence and received medical treatment but did not recover.
A police source in France said Wang had died after a 10 metre fall off a wall while trying to take photographs in the village of Bonnieux, near Avignon.
He tried to climb a low wall to see the view and take pictures,” the source said. After failing a first time, Wang took a run up. “He fell over the top and dropped 10 metres.”
HNA, based on the southern Chinese island of Hainan is best known as the owner of Hainan Airlines Co and for holding stakes in Deutsche Bank AG and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.
Wang, who held a stake of just under 15 percent in the group, was in charge of its strategy and ran day-to-day operations, sources familiar with the matter have said, while his fellow chairman, Chen Feng, was often the public face of the conglomerate.
“HNA Group extends the deepest condolences to Mr. Wang's family and many friends,” HNA's board and management team said in a statement.
“Together, we mourn the loss of an exceptionally gifted leader and role model, whose vision and values will continue to be a beacon for all who had the good fortune to know him, as well as for the many others whose lives he touched through his work and philanthropy.”
Wang told employees earlier this year that the company's difficulties were the result of a “major conspiracy” against the ruling Communist Party and President Xi Jinping by foreign and domestic “reactionary forces”, according to an internally-distributed email.
However, the embattled group appeared to have won a reprieve of sorts recently, when at a meeting held by China's central bank, lenders were told to “support” HNA bonds, Bloomberg and the Financial Times reported last month.

In the fall of 2010, faced with cuts in public financing, Bulgarian filmmakers and other members of industry bodies swept across the capital, Sofia, in a wave of protests against austerity measures introduced by the right-wing ruling party. At the time, the country's fledgling film industry was in a state of crisis. But eight years later, “the situation is completely different,” says Jana Karaivanova, executive director of the National Film Center. “Bulgarian filmmaking is thriving.”
A selection of contemporary Bulgarian cinema is on display this week at the Transilvania Intl. Film Festival, with the Focus Bulgaria sidebar spotlighting eight feature films and documentaries from the Eastern European nation. Beginning with Stephan Komandarev's “Directions,” which world premiered in Cannes' Un Certain Regard last year, the program showcases the growing cinematic output of a country still building an industry from the ground up.
“It's impossible not to notice that Bulgarian cinema is more and more present in most of the big festivals,” says TIFF artistic director Mihai Chirilov, who compares the movement to the emergence of the Romanian New Wave a decade ago. Such recognition, he says, is “not only a fashion. It's a sign that something's boiling there.”

Festival audiences have taken notice. Komandarev's darkly comic snapshot of Bulgarian dysfunction – told through the lens of a taxi driver's erratic night fares – was joined in Un Certain Regard last year by German writer-director Valeska Grisebach's “Western,” which was shot in Bulgaria as a co-production with local firm Chouchkov Brothers, while Ralitza Petrova's debut, “Godless,” about a nurse who sells the identities of her elderly patients on the black market, took the Golden Leopard in Locarno in 2016. The film will be screening in Focus Bulgaria this week, alongside another Locarno selection, “3/4,” first-time director Ilian Metev's delicately balanced study of the changing relationship between a father and his two children, which took the top prize in the fest's Cinema of the Present section.
Despite acclaim elsewhere in Europe, “Romanian audiences don't know much about Bulgarian cinema,” says Chirilov. Though he describes the two countries as “brothers in arms” who share a border and a common Soviet past, he jokingly notes that their camaraderie finds its most frequent expression at holiday resorts along the Black Sea.
“The irony is that most of the Romanians don't go to the Romanian seaside; they go to the Bulgarian seaside,” he says. “It's sexier, it's cleaner, it's cheaper. This is maybe the only thing Romanians know about Bulgarians.”
There's much to learn. With a third the population of its neighbor, Bulgaria produces the same amount of films each year while making more than double the box office. Despite the success of the Romanian New Wave, which has been one of the world's most formidable cinematic movements since the turn of the century, “we don't have any commercial Romanian cinema,” says Chirilov. “We have films for festivals, but people don't go to cinemas in Romania to watch all these awarded films.”
“It's not just commercial content,” notes Karaivanova, of the popularity of Bulgarian cinema with local viewers. “It's very good artistic pictures that won the hearts of the audience in the theaters.”
Bulgarian filmmakers have gotten a boost from the government. The annual budget includes roughly $7.7 million to fund filmmaking, distribution, and promotion, with Karaivanova pointing to a slight bump in financing this year for minority co-productions. Whereas a decade ago the National Film Center's annual call for funding applications would get 25-30 submissions, that number today tops 100.
The center has been actively strengthening co-production agreements and looking to introduce new ones “in order to make it easier and more productive” for local bizzers to engage with their foreign counterparts, says Karaivanova. Bulgarian producers, for their part, “are very energetic in creating co-productions with our neighboring countries, and with other European countries,” she adds.
This year the National Film Center inked a deal with Sofia's Nu Boyana Film Studios to collaborate on the production, promotion and international distribution of films supported by the NFC, an agreement that Karaivanova says “can take some of the projects to a totally new level.”
“It needs to be encouraged,” she says, of the Bulgarian industry's growth. “It's so important to have success on both the national and the international level.”
MOMENT OF THE DAY
England didn't get off to a flier but at 128-2 in the 28th over Eoin Morgan would have been reasonably content with his team's start on a slowish track. The wicket of Joe Root changed all that. England's star batsman had reached 46 from 56 deliveries when he top-edged an attempted cut stroke off the teenage leg-spinner Shadab Khan into the gloves of Sarfraz Ahmed. It was a dismissal from which England never recovered.
SHOT OF THE DAY
When Morgan handed Adil Rashid the ball 14 overs into Pakistan's reply, it appeared to be England's last throw of the dice. The men in green had made an excellent start and Morgan urgently needed his leg-spinner to make a breakthrough. Rather than go into his shell, Fakhar Zaman came out swinging; the left-handed opener stepping out his crease and playing a premeditated lofted drive which sailed over mid-off's head for a one-bounce four. Fakhar's attacking intent has been a breath of fresh air for a batting unit which generally tends to err on the side of caution.
Celebration of the day
Pakistan barely put a foot wrong all day, but when they did, they even made it look good, as this stumble-turned-wicket-celebration from Junaid Khan proved. Junaid did not let up his slip to spoil the chance to celebrate the wicket of Moeen Ali in second spell of his bowling after having a disastrous three overs with new ball in the start of the innings in which he had conceded 23 runs in three overs.
STAT OF THE DAY
Stokes came into this match in sublime form, having scored an unbeaten century against Australia in England's last group match, but the talismanic allrounder summed up his side's batting travails with an uncharacteristically subdued innings. Remarkably, Stokes failed to score a single boundary during his 64-ball stay at the crease, playing out 34 dots as he scrapped to get his team to a respectable total. He was by no means alone in his struggles. It was the first innings since England's defeat to New Zealand at the 2015 ICC World Cup in which the team failed to hit a six.
“Hamilton” and “Rotterdam,” both took home the 2017 production award during the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle's 49th annual ceremony Monday night at A Noise Within Theatre.

Vernon residents are upset with number of needles being found around town with spring melt
A photo of needles shared on social media in front of an Anderson Way business has sparked community outrage. (Vernon Rant and Rave image)
An abundance of needles springing up around Vernon, B.C. has the public outraged with safety concerns.
The snow melt is revealing discarded needles in various locations around town – including Anderson Way, near the Civic Arena and walking trails around town.
And it's not just Vernon.
“Last time I was in Vernon at a school playground with my daughter we found needles littered around the school yard. It is a terrifying site when you have little ones playing near this trash,” said Zachary Linderman. “I hope a solution is found for the small group of people doing this!”
See related: Needles found at school
According to Interior Health: “Anyone using a needle to inject should dispose of it safely. However, that's not always the case, and sometimes discarded needles and drug paraphernalia are found in public areas.”
Therefore those who are cleaning up needles are urged to use safe needle disposal.
– Do not try to replace the cap on the needle, snap, break or bend the needle.

Related Coverage Flynn resigns as national security adviser amid Russia controversy
WASHINGTON (AP) — Just six days into his presidency, Donald Trump was informed his national security adviser had misled his vice president about contacts with Russia. Trump kept his No. 2 in the dark and waited another two weeks before ousting the aide, Michael Flynn, citing a slow but steady erosion of trust, White House officials said Tuesday.
Flynn's telephone conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. had already drawn attention from law enforcement. He was interviewed by the FBI only days into his own new job.
In their retelling of the stunning downfall of the key adviser, officials said Tuesday that Flynn's error was not that he discussed U.S. economic sanctions with the Russians before the inauguration – a potential violation of a rarely enforced law – but the fact that he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other senior Trump aides about the nature of the conversations. White House officials said they conducted a thorough review of Flynn's interactions, even reviewing transcripts secretly recorded by U.S. intelligence officials, but found nothing illegal.
Pence, who had vouched for Flynn in a televised interview, is said to have been angry and deeply frustrated.
“The evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation and a series of other questionable incidents is what led the president to ask General Flynn for his resignation,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday, one day after the president asked Flynn to leave.
The explanation of the episode left many questions unanswered, including why Trump didn't alert Pence to the matter, why Trump allowed Flynn to keep accessing classified information and taking part in the president's discussions with world leaders up until the day he was fired. White House officials also struggled to explain why Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway had declared the president retained “full confidence” in Flynn just hours before the adviser had to submit his letter of resignation.
The White House shakeup, less than one month into Trump's tenure, marked another jarring setback for a new administration already dealing with a legal fight over the president's travel ban order and tensions among top aides. Flynn's firing also heightened questions about the president's friendly posture toward Russia. Democrats called for investigations into Flynn's contacts, and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said Congress needed to know whether he had been acting with direction from the president or others.
Trump initially thought Flynn could survive the controversy, according to a person with direct knowledge of the president's views, but a pair of explosive stories in The Washington Post in recent days made the situation untenable. As early as last week, he and aides began making contingency plans for Flynn's dismissal, a senior administration official said. While the president was said to be upset with Flynn, he also expressed anger with other aides for “losing control” of the story and making his young administration look bad.
Pence spokesman Marc Lotter said Pence became aware that he had received “incomplete information” from Flynn only after the first Washington Post report Thursday night. Pence learned about the Justice Department warnings to the White House around the same time.
The officials and others with knowledge of the situation were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and requested anonymity.
Ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration, Pence and other officials insisted publicly that Flynn had not discussed sanctions in his talks with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. On Jan. 26, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates contacted White House counsel Don McGahn to raise concerns about discrepancies between the public accounting and what intelligence officials knew to be true about the contacts based on routine recordings of communications with foreign officials who are in the U.S.
The Justice Department warned the White House that the inconsistencies would leave the president's top national security aide vulnerable to blackmail from Russia, according to a person with knowledge of the discussion. The president was informed of the warnings the same day, Spicer said.
Flynn was interviewed by FBI around the same time, according to a U.S. official was briefed on the investigation.
It was not immediately known what questions the FBI asked of Flynn or what he told law enforcement officials.
McGahn, along with chief of staff Reince Priebus and strategist Steve Bannon, also questioned Flynn multiple times in the ensuing weeks, a White House official said. Top aides also reviewed transcripts of Flynn's contacts with the ambassador, according to a person with knowledge of the review process.
At the same time, the official said Trump aides began taking steps to put some distance between the president and Flynn. CIA Director Mike Pompeo and retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, a top Flynn aide, started taking part in Trump's daily security briefings.
Top Trump advisers quietly met with Vice Admiral Robert Harward last week and spoke with the former Navy SEAL again on Monday, the White House official said. Harward is seen as the top contender for the job, though former CIA Director David Petraeus and Kellogg, who has temporarily stepped into the role, are also under consideration.
Spicer said other “questionable incidents” had contributed to Flynn's firing. According to one person with knowledge of the matter, those incidents included Flynn seeking a security clearance for his son during the transition.
At the time, it was Pence who was again put in the position of defending Flynn on television, saying he had not sought a clearance for the retired general's son.
Spicer emphasized that the White House review concluded that Flynn did not create a legal problem by discussing sanctions with the Russian ambassador, despite a law that prohibits private citizens from conducting U.S. diplomacy. He said Flynn was not discussing the matter at the president's behest.
A U.S. official told The Associated Press that Flynn was in frequent contact with Kislyak on the day the Obama administration slapped sanctions on Russia for election-related hacking, as well as at other times during the transition.
Before he resigned late Monday, Flynn spoke with an investigative news nonprofit affiliated with the right-leaning website The Daily Caller. He said “there were no lines crossed” when he spoke with Kislyak, adding that the two spoke briefly about the Russian diplomats expelled by President Barack Obama as part of the previous administration's response to Moscow's interference in the U.S. presidential election.
“It wasn't about sanctions. It was about the 35 guys who were thrown out,” Flynn said. “It was basically, ‘Look, I know this happened. We'll review everything.' I never said anything such as, ‘We're going to review sanctions,' or anything like that.”
Trump, who had been conspicuously quiet about Flynn's standing for several days, took to Twitter Tuesday morning and said the “real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington?” He ignored questions about Flynn from reporters during an education event.
Kellogg convened a brief meeting of the National Security Council staff and urged them to continue with business as usual. Staffers have been told that Flynn's deputy, K.T. McFarland, a former Fox News analyst, is expected to stay at the White House.

Associated Press writers Jonathan Lemire, Eric Tucker, Ken Thomas, Jill Colvin, Erica Werner and Catherine Lucey contributed to this report.
“Sylvia Thompson,” a Snopes reader wrote by email in November 2017, “is supposedly a black conservative woman writer.”
Her name can be found on a variety of non-mainstream right-wing web sites, next to headlines such as “Liberal Progressivism's Assault on Black America” and “No, America Should Not Have a Muslim President.”
But Thompson's columns can't be found in mainstream newspapers, and she doesn't have a Twitter account or a personal web site for her writings.
The reader continued: “Is this simply a matter of ‘fake news' and a ‘fake personality' hoax to rally right-wingers and racists to support ‘her' supposed anti-black opinions?”
In August, Twitter suspended the account of ‘Nicole Mincey,' a young, black female Trump-supporter, when — after she was retweeted by President Trump — web sleuths discovered that Mincey did not exist.
In this climate, it's perhaps inevitable that some might view with suspicion the authenticity of an older black woman popping up on right-wing web sites and offering views that are out of line with a majority of the black community.
For example, here's Thompson weighing in on the NFL national anthem protests:
…I am an American black citizen, and I have had it up to the gills with black people who embrace victimhood. I also highly resent my being expected to do the same in order to affirm my “blackness.”
However, Sylvia Thompson is not the creation of the alt-right or the virtual alter ego of a real-life white man. She is a black conservative woman writer, and has been for years.
Born in Beaumont, Texas but now living in Spring Hill, Tennessee, 30 miles south of Nashville, Thompson has been plowing the same rhetorical furrow for more than a decade.
Readers of the Tennessean newspaper might be familiar with her letter-writing. Here she is in 2007, condemning what she calls the “homosexual agenda” (Thompson has elsewhere written ominously about “homofascism.”)
Although feeling sympathy for people trapped in disordered lifestyles, the majority of Americans do not see foisting the acceptance of homosexuality on society as a wise, sane or healthy endeavor.
It's clear that she has carried this worldview through to her columns, which have appeared on Barb Wire (the web site founded by Christian conservative attorney and former boxer Matt Barber), Canada Free Press and Renew America, the web site launched by perennial Republican presidential candidate and broadcaster Alan Keyes.
We repeatedly attempted to contact Thompson, who did not get back to us. But we spoke to Carol Swain, a former Vanderbilt University political science and law professor, who has met Thompson, corresponded with her, and is familiar with her views and writing. When it was put to her that some people had questioned the authenticity of Thompson's identity in light of her conservative views, Swain — who is herself a black conservative woman — told us, “It's such a joke”:
The new route, which will operate all day with buses at stops every 15 minutes, will go from the new Metrolink station, located on San Fernando Boulevard near Hollywood Way, down Hollywood, then east on Winona Avenue, south on Ontario Street, east on Empire Avenue, north on Lincoln Street and then north on San Fernando back to the station.
Hospital surveillance camera footage captured what police left out of their report.
Two police officers in Paterson, New Jersey, went to a local hospital March 5 on reports of a man who attempted suicide, video showed — and after the man threw an object into the hallway and insulted one of the cops, the officers grabbed the man's wheelchair, punched him in the face and pushed him to the ground, according to a federal criminal complaint.
Another video (this one allegedly recorded by Officer Roger Then, 29, on his cellphone) caught the second stage of the assault, prosecutors said. At that point, the victim was in his hospital bed, video showed. Lying on his back, the suicidal man hurled an insult at an unidentified police officer. In response, that officer grabbed a pair of hospital gloves, put them on and “violently struck” the man two times, prosecutors said.
“I ain't f-----g playing with you,” the unidentified officer told the man, according to prosecutors.

Federal agents arrested Officer Then Wednesday morning on charges of conspiracy to violate civil rights by using excessive force. He also faces charges for concealing the alleged crime, New Jersey U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito said.
If convicted, the civil rights charge could land Officer Then with up to 10 years in prison, while the charge for allegedly concealing it carries as much as three years. He could also face a fine of as much as $250,000, prosecutors said.
Injuries to the victim's face and eye were so severe that he required surgery, investigators said.
The unnamed officer “is no longer on active duty” with the police department, as of April 2018, the complaint said.
The two uniformed, on-duty officers initially responded to the man's home after he attempted suicide the night of March 5, according to the complaint. As the fire department took the man to the St. Joseph's Medical Center for treatment, police went to the hospital as well.
The first incident unfolded in the waiting room, where the victim was sitting in a wheelchair, the complaint said. Meanwhile, an officer was standing at the hospital's admissions desk.
That's when the victim tossed something down the hallway, surveillance video showed. Apparently angry at the man, the officer ran toward the suicidal man “and cocked his right arm as though he was going to punch,” the complaint said. Next the unnamed officer pushed the man's wheelchair, punched him and sent him falling to the ground — still in the wheelchair, according to the complaint.
At that point, Officer Then “used his right hand to grab the victim by the back of the victim's neck and further push the victim to the ground,” the complaint said.
The second video came from the patient's room, the complaint said. Officer Then recorded himself on camera “with a large smile across his face” and then turned the camera to show the other officer and the victim lying in the bed, according to the complaint.
“Ha, ha, b---h,” the victim told the officer, according to the complaint.
“I'm a what?” the officer responded in the video.
“Do it,” the victim said, according to the complaint.
At that point, the unnamed officer pulled on the gloves and began assaulting the man, the complaint said. During the assault, the victim used his hands to shield his face. He remained silent, the complaint said.
“Calm your ass down,” the assaulting officer said, according to the complaint.
But none of that is in the relatively short police report, the complaint said. And the officers didn't disclose the existence of the video on Officer Then's phone.
In their report, the officers wrote that the man “cut his left wrist with a boxcutter” but that the injury “was non life threatening.” They described the man as “combative,” writing that he began to “throw medical glove boxes at the staff.” The officers wrote that they and security staff “restrained” him so he could be taken for a psychiatric evaluation, according to the complaint.
“It should be noted these officers were advised by the medical staff that [the victim] has a history psychiatric issues,” the officers wrote in their report, according to the criminal complaint against Officer Then.
Paterson Police Director Jerry Speziale told NBC New York he couldn't offer comment on the incident because an investigation into it is ongoing.
“This is not indicative of the Paterson Police Department,” Speziale told the Paterson Times, adding that the city's department began the investigation with the FBI hoping to “clean house.”
Officer Then's arrest is the fourth in the department in recent months, the Bergen Record reports. The other arrests were not related to the incident involving Officer Then.
Source: RBZ ready to bail out companies – NewsDay Zimbabwe October 5, 2017
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) says there is cheaper funding for smaller and medium sized companies under the financial inclusion strategy aimed at creating a broad-based economy.
BY BUSINESS REPORTER
Speaking to journalists after a tour of furniture manufacturer, Teecherz, RBZ deputy governor Jesimen Chipika said there is cheaper funding for a graduation from micro into small, medium and large companies.
“We have cheaper funding particular for smaller and medium-sized companies, which we have put under the national financial inclusion strategy when we noted that our SMEs were not accessing the financing. We had to design under different facilities that are not covering not only SMEs but all other previously marginalised groups. We are putting them under the national financial inclusion strategy,” she said.
“To us, we are saying if we do financial inclusion, we support the growing of an inclusive broad-based economy. The moment we have a broad-based economy, that's sustainable development. The progression is natural than instead of dealing with a small enclave economy with a few companies, where we are all looking for jobs.”
Chipika said Teecherz was a fully-fledged facility operating with high level of capacity, lauding the company for venturing into the export market.
Teecherz chief executive officer Phanuel Vheriwa said they were generating about $200 000 monthly from exports and about $350 000 from the domestic market, which could have been more had it not been for limited resources.
He said foreign currency shortages and absence of cheaper financing were obstructing the company from enjoying economies of scale.
This, he said, has a bearing on pricing. Vheriwa said availability of forex and financing would help companies enjoy benefits of import restriction through Statutory Instrument 64 of 2016.
“Support should not be for us, but the entire value chain,” he said.
The company has been operational since 1994 and has two factories, one in Harare and the other in Bulawayo.
It has 24 retail shops countrywide and has a staff complement of 385.

The brutal, deadly attacks in London and Manchester on innocent civilians are the latest in a series of senseless violent acts carried out by the so-called Islamic State, a group that deserves no designation other than the world's most inhuman criminal network.
In response to this threat, the world's Muslims can and should help intelligence and security communities ward off future attacks and eliminate the lifelines of this menace.
From its founding amid the ashes of Al Qaeda in Iraq, ISIS has dealt in deception as well as death. Despite its name, ISIS represents a perversion of Islam. The group's dress, flags and slogans cannot hide their abhorrent betrayal of the spirit of this major world faith.
Denying this barbaric group a geographical base that emboldens them to claim statehood - an essential element of their propaganda to potential recruits - is a worthwhile goal that all Muslims should support. But the challenge isn't only military.
ISIS, and other groups like it, recruits alienated Muslim youth by offering them a false sense of purpose and belonging in the service of a totalitarian ideology.
Countering that appeal will include religious, political, psycho-social and economic efforts. It will require that local communities and government institutions address structural issues such as discrimination and exclusion.
International organizations must protect citizens against violent persecution of the kind we witnessed in Syria and assist with transitions to democratic governance. Western governments, too, have a responsibility to adopt a more ethical and consistent foreign policy.
Muslim citizens and organizations can and should be part of these broader efforts, but we also have a unique role and responsibility in this fight.
Across the world, Muslims need to strengthen the immune system of our communities, especially our youth, against violent extremism. We must ask: How did our communities become grounds for terrorist recruitment? Yes, external factors must be addressed, but we must also look within.
Self-examination is an Islamic ethic. There are actions we can take, as Muslim parents, teachers, community leaders and imams, to help our youth protect themselves. We must defeat these murderous extremists in the battlefield of ideas.
A common fallacy of violent extremist ideologues is to decontextualize the teachings of the Quran and the Prophet (peace be upon him) and misinterpret them to serve their pre-determined goals. These ideologues turn snapshots from his or his companions' lives into instruments to justify a criminal act.
The antidote is a religious education program that teaches the tradition in a holistic and contextualized way. To be able to resist the deceits of radical ideologues, young Muslims must understand the spirit of their scripture and the overarching principles of their Prophet's life. We need to teach our youth the full story of how the Prophet (peace be upon him) moved his society from savagery into ethical norms shared by Abrahamic faiths.
A holistic religious education should start with a commitment to the dignity of every person as a unique creation of God, regardless of faith. When God says “We have honored the children of Adam” (Quran, 17:70), all humanity is honored. The Quran describes taking the life of even one innocent person as a crime against all humanity (Quran, 5:32). Even in a legitimate defensive war, the Prophet's teachings specifically prohibit violence against any noncombatants, especially women, children and clergy. The belief that one can enter paradise by killing others is a delusion.
Violent extremists also commit another major fallacy: transplanting into the 21st century religious verdicts from the Middle Ages, in which political rivalries were often confused with religious differences. Today, Muslims have the freedom to practice their religion in democratic, secular countries. The values of participatory governments align with core Muslim ideals of social justice, the rule of law, collective decision-making and equality. Muslims can and do live as contributing citizens of democracies around the world.
Proactively, we must develop positive ways to satisfy the social needs of our youth. Youth groups should be encouraged to volunteer in humanitarian relief projects to help victims of disasters and violent conflicts. In teaching them to help others, we will give them the tools to empower themselves and feel that they are part of something meaningful. We also have a duty to help the youth engage in dialogue with members of other faiths to help nurture mutual understanding and respect. As Muslims, we are not just members of a faith community, but of the human family.
Since the 1970s, the participants in the social movement Hizmet - the Turkish word for service - have founded more than 1,000 modern secular schools, free tutoring centers, colleges, hospitals and humanitarian relief organizations in more than 150 countries. By facilitating the involvement of young students and professionals as service providers, mentors, tutors and helpers, these institutions and their social networks foster a sense of identity, belonging, meaning and empowerment that constitute an antidote to the false promises of violent extremists.
Indeed, the best way to proactively protect our youth is to provide them with a positive counter-narrative. By offering opportunities for language learning and cultural exchanges, these kinds of institutions nurture a pluralistic outlook, critical thinking and empathy.
As part of their daily rituals, practising Muslims pray for God to keep them “on the straight path.” Today, the straight path means examining our understanding of the core values of our faith, how we embody those values in our daily lives and strengthening our youth's resistance to influences that contradict those values.
Being part of the worldwide effort to help stop violent religious radicals from repeating the London and Manchester cruelties elsewhere is both a human and religious responsibility.

Bengaluru: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address a massive BJP rally in Bengaluru on Sunday that marks the conclusion of the party's 90-day Nava Nirman Parivarthan yatra across poll-bound Karnataka, said a party official on Saturday.
"Modi will arrive in the city on Sunday afternoon and address the rally at the Palace grounds in the evening. Thousands of our cadres from across the state and people from the city will participate in the event," the official told IANS.
Though Modi was scheduled to address the rally on 28 January, on the conclusion of the three-month yatra that began in Bengaluru on 1 November, it was put off to 4 February, owing to his pre-occupation with other engagements.
"As the budget session of Parliament was beginning on 29 January and the Union Budget was to be presented on 1 February, Modi could not attend the rally on last Sunday as he was busy then," recalled the party functionary.
Elaborate security arrangements have been made for the rally at the sprawling venue in the city centre where the party is expecting at least one lakh people to attend and listen to Modi's speech.
"We have invited thousands of youth, especially techies and executives of IT and biotech companies in the city to personally listen to Modi's speech though it will also be telecast live on news channels and available on YouTube," asserted the official.
The party's state unit has opened an online registration and is using the social media, including Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp to personally invite the youth, techies, educated class and prominent citizens to the venue, assuring them of seating arrangements.
"About 30,000 people from across the city have responded, expressing interest in attending the rally and listen to Modi's speech. We hope most of them will turn up as elaborate parking facility has been made for their vehicles at the venue," added the official.
In the run-up to the state election, due in late April and early May, the BJP conducted the yatra, criss-crossing nearly all the 224 constituencies of the Assembly across the state after its national president Amit Shah flagged it off.
The yatra, held with a view to bringing the Bharatiya Janata Party back to power in the southern state on the plank of transforming Karnataka through development, was led by its state unit president and former chief minister BS Yeddyurappa and party's other state leaders.
Besides Shah, party's central ministers Prakash Javadekar and Piyush Goyal who are in-charge of the BJP poll campaign in Karnataka, Ananth Kumar, DV Sadananda Gowda and Ananthkumar Hegde who hail from the state and the party's all-state leaders will participate in the rally and address the public.
As the pro-Kannada organisations have withdrawn their call for a Bengaluru shutdown on Sunday for the prime minister's intervention in the sharing of the Mahadayi river water with Goa state, the party's organisers are betting on a huge response to the rally from the public on a weekend.
Jeremy J. Kamps' play "Runaway Home,” now premiering at the Fountain Theatre, is set in New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward three years after Hurricane Katrina. The waters may have long receded, but the residents still wander like ghosts through the wreckage of their lives.
Stephanie Kerley Schwartz's set is heaped with piles of debris, once-cherished items now good for nothing but reminding people of what they've lost. A half-senile local, Mr. Dee (Jeris Poindexter), notes that his wife's prized ”Sunday wig" is a ratty-looking horror lying atop a heap of boxes.
The play's 14-year-old protagonist, Kali (Camille Spirlin), introduces herself to the audience in a lively rhyming soliloquy as she picks through the junk. A precocious kid with a rebellious attitude and a gift for words, Kali is still mourning her grandmother, who died during the hurricane. She and her mother just moved back to their ruined house after three years in Baton Rouge, but they haven't been getting along. Things are so bad between them that Kali is running away with nothing but her backpack and an old twirling baton.
She isn't on the road for long when she's caught stealing from a bodega by its owner, Armando (Armando Rey), an immigrant struggling to earn the money to bring his two daughters from Mexico. Against his better judgment, softhearted Armando takes a liking to the sassy, pugnacious Kali. She talks him into hiring her to sweep the store, and within days he has given her a set of keys.
Kali also gets to know a self-styled anarchist who calls himself Lone Wolf (Brian Tichnell). Lone Wolf is in the area as a volunteer, “gutting and mucking” mold-ravaged houses — as the playwright himself did in New Orleans after Katrina. Although Lone Wolf means well, he eventually proves a bit of a blowhard, derailing a rally organized by Kali's politically minded neighbor, Shana (Karen Malina White). Still, Kali is impressed. “I'm gonna be an anarchist,” she declares.
“I got a feeling you already are,” Lone Wolf replies.
Lone Wolf also teaches Kali a new way to think about stealing — “liberating” things from the capitalist machine — and she takes it upon herself to liberate a gun. “Just in case my historical moment presents itself,” she ominously explains.
Meanwhile, Kali's mother, Eunice (Maya Lynne Robinson), sits at home wondering where Kali has gone and whether she should bother to look for her. When Eunice's no-good, charismatic former fiance, Tat (Leith Burke), tracks her down and tries to sweet-talk her into a reunion, she is briefly tempted — then recovers her maternal instincts and sets out to find her “demon child” instead.
Kamps has a way with dialogue and the Louisiana patois, and under Shirley Jo Finney's sensitive direction, the actors inhabit their characters with endearing naturalism, even during the expressionistic, poetic interludes. Their conversations are so entertaining that they frequently mask the clanking and grinding of the plot's gears, at least until the implausible, puzzling denouement.
If its story line is still a bit murky, “Runaway Home” conveys a poignant sense of the human suffering that follows a natural disaster — long after the cameras have stopped rolling and the world has turned its attention elsewhere.

A pillar of Alberta's economy is getting greater access into one of the world's largest marketplaces. China is loosening restrictions on Canadian beef and pork, allowing producers to export bone in beef cuts and fresh chilled meat into the country.

“Up to this point, anything we've shipped to China has had to have been frozen and boneless,” said John Masswohl, the director of Government and International Relations with the Canadian Cattlemen's Association.
“It gives us a lot more options.”
The increased access is expected to boost exports of pork products by $100 million over the next five years, and $125 million for beef producers over the same time frame.

For beef producers like Colin Campbell, the potential new customers mean more stability for the entire industry.
“When you have a greater variety of markets, your price stabilizes,” Campbell told Global News on his farm just north of Edmonton.
“The value that is realized over and above our domestic markets is in the excess of $500 per carcass.”
The majority of Canada's beef is produced in Alberta, and the government has made expanding markets into China a priority.

Mashal Khan was a student of Abdul Wali Khan University, Mardan (AWKUM), who was lynched by a mob of fellow students, university employees and outsiders for allegedly having committed blasphemy, a charge that was not substantiated in initial police inquiry.
Later, the joint investigation team set up under the directives of the Supreme Court also reported that the blasphemy charges were unfounded and that the murder was planned by a political group that saw Mashal's activities as a threat. The JIT had also pointed fingers at the administration of AWKUM for corruption and administrative failures. The JIT report also stated that several employees in AWKUM were employed on political basis, which, the report said, had deteriorated affairs at the university.
On June 10, Iqbal Khan had requested the PHC to transfer his son's case to the Anti-Terrorism Court, Haripur or any other safe place, citing possible threats from opponents.
In the petition, Iqbal Khan through his lawyer Abdul Lateef Afridi advocate said that as majority of the accused nominated in the case were not only locals of Mardan district but also very influential, therefore he was unable to pursue the case in Mardan out of security fears.
The petition further said that frequently visiting Mardan for proceedings of the case could put his life in danger.
In light of the security threats, Iqbal pleaded to the PHC to transfer Mashal's murder case from Mardan to an anti-terror court in Haripur or another secured city.
Iqbal has also filed a similar petition with the Supreme Court, seeking the court's intervention in provision of accommodation to his family in Islamabad and admission in educational institutions to his two daughters.
It is pertinent to mention here that some religious elements have been staging demonstration in Mardan calling for the release of the suspects arrested in connection with involvement in Mashal's murder. The religious elements have the backing of an influential figure of the Jamiat-e-Ulama-e-Islam-Fazl, who was also elected a member of the national assembly during the 2002 general elections.

The next-generation Ford Focus, which is due out in Europe sometime next year, will go more upmarket, according to a new report from Automotive News Europe. Jim Farley, Ford's head of global markets, revealed to investors that the automaker is moving its compact offering in a more premium direction and its volumes are expected to be lower than they are presently.
This news follows a recent speech by Ford's new CEO Jim Hackett who outlined changes happening in the company including reducing costs and moving a substantial amount of funds away from internal combustion engines to developing electrified vehicles. Like the new generation Fiesta, which reportedly won't come to the U.S., the Focus will get more upscale features including a Vignale trim for the European market and a crossover-like Active variant. European-spec Focus models will be built in Ford's Saarlouis, Germany plant. Earlier this year, the Blue Oval announced that the North American-spec Focus will come from China.
Sales of the Focus in Europe dropped by 1.2 percent for the first half of 2017 to 119,052 units, meaning it's now behind the Volkswagen Golf, Opel/Vauxhall Astra, and the Skoda Octavia. The move to crossovers has also caused the compact car segment in Europe to fall by 1.9 percent. Volumes for the next-generation Focus will be even lower if Ford decides to concentrate on the more expensive models, which is similar to what happened with the Fiesta.
Automotive News Europe also revealed that the Blue Oval's European arm will “accelerate urban utility products,” but Farley didn't specify what these were exactly. However, it's possible that Ford is developing another small crossover that will slot alongside the EcoSport in its lineup.

Churchill is a tight-knit community of 900 people.
But since the rail line washed out in the spring of 2017, it's a community that is getting smaller each week.
“Churchill has always been the type of place where we are remote but we're not isolated,” resident Echo Finlay said. “To see some really key community people leaving is so scary.”
Town officials told Global News 30 families have left Churchill since last May.
RELATED: Tourism industry in Churchill taking hit since rail line wash-out last spring
“It's challenging for sure,” Mayor Michael Spence said. “We're going through challenges of low employment rates.”
As jobs become harder to find and fuel and food costs continue to soar, some residents felt they were left with no choice but to leave the northern town all together.
“It's like having part of your family move away and then you're stuck there at the table going well now what? It's just an empty seat,” Finlay said.
Those empty seats are being found more often inside the Duke of Marlborough, Churchill's only school.
“We're down about 40 students from where we were last June,” Chief Superintendent of the Frontier School Division Reg Klassen said. “That's a result of what has happened with the rail line. That's a direct result of that based on loss of jobs in Churchill.”
Klassen said it's not surprising, because even the school division is feeling the pinch when it comes to rising costs. In previous years the division would bring students south to participate in different events. But it's now become far too costly.

Klassen also said a lower school enrolment could have an impact on teaching jobs for the next school year.
“It means that we have to look at staffing,” he said. “A significant drop in student enrolment has some correlation to staffing, so that will require some thought on that.”
However, the ultimate impact the community will endure is still undetermined.
There is no timeline for the rail line to be fixed.
The 2017 FINA World Junior Swimming Championships are slated to kick-off in Indianapolis, Indiana on August 23rd and a young, talented British contingent is ready to make its mark. A 22-strong roster, which includes 2017 World Championships semi-finalist Freya Anderson and European Junior Champion Emily Large, will try to improve upon Great Britain's 10th place finish in the overall medal table at the 2015 edition of the meet in Singapore. At that meet, GBR raced away with just 1 gold medal, but will try to collect more hardware this time around.
British Swimming's Head of Elite Development Tim Jones is anticipating some break-out swims from the junior British stars to help make that happen.
“This will be an exciting event coming at the conclusion of a busy season of high quality racing,” Jones said. “We have already seen some incredible performances by junior swimmers from across the globe at the recent World Championships in Budapest and European Junior Championships in Netanya.
“As an event the World Juniors is growing in importance, and for that reason we have chosen to prioritize the meet for a sizeable group of British swimmers.
“Our goal will be to continue to unearth and develop some exciting junior talent who show the potential to add to our British result in Tokyo 2020, but also reinforce the need for our athletes to be at their best at these ‘end of season' benchmark events.
“We look forward to stepping up to the plate against some of our keenest international rivals.”
Below is the British World Junior Swimming Championships roster:

PARIS (Reuters) - France will push for an European financial transactions tax to fund the fight against climate change, four French government ministers said in a joint statement.
FILE PHOTO: Protesters throw up a globe-shaped balloon during a rally held the day before the start of the 2015 Paris World Climate Change Conference, known as the COP21 summit, in Rome, Italy, November 29, 2015. REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi/File Photo
The tax could raise up to 5 billion euros ($5.9 billion) per year by 2020, according to a joint opinion piece authored by finance minister Bruno Le Maire, foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, environment minister Nicolas Hulot and higher education minister Frederique Vidal.
It was published in Le Journal du Dimanche ahead of a climate summit in Paris on Monday.
They said that France had already put in place a financial transactions tax which helps finance its environmental policies.
“We will push for this tax to become applicable in Europe and will ask everyone to take part in this solidarity effort,” the four ministers said.
In 2012, France introduced a 0.2 percent tax on purchases of shares in French companies with a market capitalization of at least 1 billion euros. The tax raised 1.1 billion euros in 2016 and was raised to 0.3 percent this year.
France and Germany have long led efforts to create a financial transactions tax. Ten countries - Germany, France, Italy, Austria, Belgium, Greece, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain - have signed up in principle.
But talks have dragged on since 2011 as countries struggle to agree what instruments should be covered and at which rate.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in July he would push for a European financial transaction tax as long as it was effective. He added that it depended on whether Britain would have access to EU financial markets after Brexit, as otherwise firms would move to London where the tax will not apply.
Banks and other opponents of the tax argue that it only makes sense if it covers many countries or else transactions will shift toward financial centres not covered by it.

Barcelona striker Neymar is confident the Catalans can launch another remarkable Champions League comeback as they look to overturn a 3-0 quarter-final deficit against Juventus on Wednesday.
Just as they had done in the previous round, when Barcelona overcame a 4-0 first-leg deficit to eliminate Paris St Germain, the Spanish giants will be relying on Neymar to produce another magical performance if they are to reach the semi-finals.
The Brazilian scored Barcelona's fourth and fifth goals in the last 16 second leg, setting up the sixth too, as they won 6-1 to progress 6-5 on aggregate.
If Barcelona is to do the impossible in the quarter-final as well, after losing 3-0 in Turin, they will need the winger to be at his electric best.
Neymar should be well rested after missing Barcelona's 3-2 win over Real Sociedad on Saturday, the first of three matches he is suspended for in La Liga, including next Sunday's Clasico.
Having been sent off in the team's 2-0 defeat at Malaga and hit with a longer ban after sarcastically applauding the fourth official, he has a point to prove in the Champions League.
"We have to believe we can do it," said Neymar in an interview with Brazilian television channel Esporte Interativo.
"The other day my father told me one thing which has stayed in my head, and I think it's true. In front of us we have a different team, but Barcelona is the same. And we can do it.
"We did it once and we can do it a second time. We have to give our absolute maximum. If everything goes well, there will be another comeback.
"I believe in the team and in our power. Everything is lost (already), so we have nothing to lose and everything to gain."
Although Neymar will return for the clash, Barcelona are likely to be without Javier Mascherano, who did not train on Monday due to a calf injury, as well as long-term absentees Aleix Vidal and Rafinha.
Juventus forward Paulo Dybala, who scored twice in the first leg, was taken off with an ankle injury as they won 2-0 at Pescara on Saturday, but is expected to be fit to play.
Defender Georgio Chiellini watched Neymar and co. dismantle PSG in the previous round and is wary of the threat the Catalans pose.
"We need to be compact and show no fear. (Barcelona) are like sharks who scent blood and finish you off. We've got to keep them as far away from our goal as possible," he told Sky Italia.
If former Barcelona defender Dani Alves can keep his friend and compatriot Neymar at bay like he did in the first leg, Juventus should be able to book their place in the semi finals.
Talk about hair of the dog. Mere hours after Katy Perry left pal Jeremy Scott's Moschino fete to celebrate his Candy Crush collection, the “I Kissed A Girl” singer was playing hostess to a Easter Day Recovery Brunch, which also marked the launch of the Katy Perry Footwear line.
A field filled with larger-than-life inflatable Easter eggs led the way to the entrance of the private estate in Thermal, Calif., which Perry had taken over for the occasion. Arriving at 3:30 p.m., she posed against a wall of edible doughnuts, inside a larger-than-life shoe, and atop her sky-blue vintage Mercedes convertible, which has also been featured in her ad campaign images.

Perry stopped by all the brand activation stations, which gave partygoers a chance to relax and rejuvenate after pulling all-nighters. The gratis amusements (which brands donated in the name of marketing) included a make-your-own bloody mary bar, a Juicero pop-up and an oxygen bar.
A cheeky purple Easter bunny roamed the grounds posing for photos, whiskey bottle in hand (with no Perry in sight at the time, one had to wonder, could she be beneath the costume?)

The party was produced by Los Angeles nightlife impresarios The H.Wood Group (behind hotspots The Nice Guy and Blind Dragon); cofounder John Terzian is an old friend of Perry's. Her BFF Markus Molinari also produced, joking, “She should name her next shoe after me.”
Brunch included fried chicken and churro waffles, as well as vegan alternatives. Russell Simmons opted for the waffles.

For her Easter Sunday look, Perry chose white shorts, a white tank top and a fishnet coverup, with gold bauble earrings. In keeping with the Easter theme, she wore her own bunny-themed flats and carried a somewhat macabre white rabbit-head-shaped handbag. The style from her collection was actually based on a pair of vintage flats she found years ago, as she told WWD earlier.
She also danced with pal Mia Moretti again (on Saturday night, the two were spotted on the decks together at Scott's event) and posed for photos with her stylist and creative director of her shoe line, Johnny Wujek.

islamabad - Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) has urged Ministry of Capital Administration and Development Division (CADD) to suspend the invigilator Sadat Bashir from services on allegedly harassing more than 80 girls at Bahria College during examinations, said the official on Wednesday.
Director General (DG) FDE Hasanat Qureshi talking to The Nation said that FDE has written to the CADD ministry to suspend the accused examiner after severe allegations of harassment against female students during practical examination, emerged against him. Raising the issue on social media, dozens of students complained that they were touched inappropriately by the examiner during practical examinations taking place on May 24, 26 and 27. He said that FDE has also initiated an internal inquiry against the examiner to probe the matter but ministry of CADD has the authority of suspending the official.
DG FDE said that the accused official has a track record of inappropriate acts and has also faced an inquiry under similar charges in 2014.
“However, charges against him in previous inquiry were not proved and he was exonerated,” said DG FDE.
He added that the inquiry will be held on criminal basis against the accused official and will be taken to end.
“But we cannot convict anyone without evidence and witnesses,” he said.
DG FDE Hasnat Qureshi however, denounced the Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (FBISE) for appointing a male examiner in female college.
“FBISE should not have placed a male invigilator in the female college,” he said.
Meanwhile, controller examination Miss Fatima talking to The Nation said that FBISE has formed a three members committee comprising 02 controllers and a deputy secretary to inquire the matter.
She said that formal inquiry process will start today while during informal proceedings the students and college administration has been approached to provide witnesses regarding the incident.
She said that a number of female students have been called to record their statement but only 5 students have come forward till now.
Controller examination also added that the board initially received ‘mixed reaction' from female students as some of them also denied any incident.
“The students who complained said that the examiner passed indecent remarks on them,” she said.
She also added that the accused invigilator was not the employee of FBISE but was hired as examiner of the biology practical from an H-9 College for duty.
Sources informed The Nation that teachers at H-9 College also held a meeting after the charges of harassment surfaced against their colleague.
“A fair trail must be done instead of character assassination of any individual from both sides,” it was decided in the meeting source said.
According to the source, the accused examiner Sadat Bashir informed his colleagues that he had applied strict criteria during the practical examination and is now being framed for following the merit.
Sadat Bashir in a statement said that he has never been involved in such activities and denies every charge against him.
Students on Twitter and Facebook also claimed that the examiner, misusing his authority, had threatened the students to deduct their marks in exam if they complained against him.
Students also alleged that the internal examiner also advised them to remain keep quite to get fair marks.
However, after the issue went viral on the social media the college administration also lodged the complaint with the FBISE regarding misconduct of the accused examiner. However the college administration refused to lodge the FIR against the examiner.
“We don't want our students to appear before investigations,” an official of the college said.

Contestants in “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda's #Ham4All campaign were vying for a rare prize: tickets to opening night of the musical in Los Angeles, plus airfare, hotel accommodations and a chance to meet the man himself at the after-party Wednesday.
Miranda created the contest in conjunction with Prizeo to raise money for the Immigrants: We Get the Job Done Coalition. The group is composed of 12 organizations that, according to contest organizers, “provide services to immigrants, refugees and asylees, including legal representation, advocacy and awareness campaigns.”
Contestants gave money to the coalition and got a number of entries based on the size of the donation. Miranda posted a video on Twitter encouraging contestants to post videos of themselves singing their favorite “Hamilton” songs labeled #Ham4All.
And the winner, picked at random, has been announced: @majazja. For everyone else, at least they have all those #Ham4All videos, some of which you can watch below.

Wise books have been written about Mozart's last year, and two works of lyrical wonder from it — the 35-year-old composer's Clarinet Concerto and his opera “The Magic Flute” — have maintained a special hold on the popular imagination for more than two centuries. Yet it's still impossible to make sense of 1791. Although Mozart wasn't one to look back, the world has done little else when it comes to contending with an unintended late style.
Gustavo Dudamel chose to end the Los Angeles Philharmonic's brief survey of Mozart's 1791 this week in Walt Disney Concert Hall with that beloved concerto and opera. (The program runs through Sunday.) He also chose, wisely, to stop far short of making sense of that final year.
The Clarinet Concerto and “Magic Flute” are often linked as having been cast in similar sweetly idealistic molds, revealing as they do Mozart's love of life. The composer certainly loved the clarinet and was the first to turn it into the supreme extension of the larynx. No disarming machine — sorry, Siri — has ever sounded so ideally human as Mozart's clarinet. Even “Flute” is suffused with a clarinet aura lent to the orchestral winds in many of its magical passages, passages that help an opera of sheer idealism, however disguised in childlike fantasy, to proscribe a process for society to rise above pettiness.
Curiously enough, the two halves of the program somewhat turned things around. The harlequin-esque Swedish clarinetist Martin Fröst, as is his wont (and a wont that has made him very popular), played and boogied his way through Mozart's concerto. The dancing is both physical and musical. He bops to the left and he bops to the right, back and forth, as he plays and even when he's not playing.
At the same time, Fröst's tongue bops with a liquidity the equal of which I've never encountered. The sheer mutability of his tonguing creates a seductive flow that is indeed the ideal of song. He finds the last drop of beauty in Mozart's concerto. The audience eats it up.
But you have to put up with a lot mannerism. Even though Fröst played a basset clarinet, the elongated early version of the instrument for which Mozart wrote his concerto, Fröst's style has an unsettling post-Mozart quality to it. He may be the epitome of the modern performer, stylish in dress and manner and showman through and through, but the dreamy character of his playing is like looking at Mozart through a misty pre-Raphaelite lens.
While keeping the orchestra more focused, Dudamel mostly deferred to Fröst, but the conductor then took charge of a dynamic 70 minutes' worth of “Flute,” with a spectacular young cast who placed graphic drama over childlike fantasy. There was none of the dialogue, just musical numbers. A handful of major arias and ensemble numbers were eliminated and a couple of minor ones included. There was no attempt to tell the story of the “Flute.”
Instead, Dudamel emphasized a raw dramatic intensity that too often gets buried under cartoon cuteness or Masonic exoticism. He followed the lead of Peter Sellars and Peter Brook — Sellars' Glyndebourne production that eliminated the dialogue and updated the libretto to the drug underworld of the modern-day Sunset Strip, and Brook's mysterious, multicultural ritual reductive version.
Maybe it was no coincidence then that soprano Julia Bullock, the stunning Pamina, got her professional start in Brooks' “Flute” and is a mainstay in Sellars' recent work. (She's starring in the premiere of the Sellars' production of John Adams' “Girls of the Golden West” at San Francisco Opera next month.) Indeed the L.A. Phil purloined much of the cast of “Golden West,” including tenor Paul Appleby as Tamino and baritone Elliot Madore (as well as J'Nai Bridges, who last week joined Appleby in the first 1791 program).
That collegiality of the three “Flute” leads may also explain why what had been planned as a concert performance became theatrical. There was no director; the performers themselves took charge of an effective and unfussy semi-staging in which they used a platform behind the stage as well as the area in front of the orchestra.
There was humor in Madore's otherwise unusually virile and emotional Papageno. And when the three women (Gabriella Reyes de Ramirez, Emily D'Angelo and Sara Couden, all enticing), after padlocking Papageno's mouth for his dissembling, sang (as translated on the projected titles) “If all liars had such a lock to their lips,” there were politically tinged titters in the audience.
But mainly this performance was a kind of pure distillation of the deep human emotions that usually lie buried at the heart of “Flute.” Bullock projected a magnificent aura of implacable spiritual grace in the face of danger. Appleby provided the fervor. Only Jessica Pratt's Queen of the Night seemed studied. Jack Fagan, Brandon Takahashi and Enzo Grappone, the three boy sopranos, all won hearts.
Dudamel, for the most part, exchanged playfulness for passion. The orchestral playing was detailed, carefully colored and stirring. The high priest Sarastro and most of the Masonic business was left out. The fire and water trials of Pamina and Tamino were treated not as magical rites but trials of a deepening relationship. Dudamel ended with the duet between Papageno and Papagena (the lively Vanessa Becerra) as an apotheosis.
This all proved so illuminating you almost didn't want a complete “Flute,” although Dudamel was clearly born to conduct one sooner or later. At the same time the approach proved satisfyingly unilluminating in its willingness to leave the meaning of Mozart's final year the eternal unanswered question it must, like all worthwhile spiritual pursuits, remain.

Police have identified a man killed in a single-vehicle crash northwest of Woodstock. The crash happened on 37th Line, between Road 92 and Road 96, in Zorra Townships at 2:45 p.m. on Sunday, Oxford OPP said.
The driver of the vehicle was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead.
Police on Monday identified the deceased as Robert Loghrin, 67, of Zorra Township. The crash remains under investigation.
Dodgers outfielder Yasiel Puig received a one-game suspension for making an obscene gesture toward fans during Tuesday's game against the Cleveland Indians at Progressive Field.
Puig chose to appeal the suspension, and was in the lineup on Wednesday. The punishment also included an undisclosed fine.
Puig flashed two middle fingers toward fans behind the plate after hitting a home run. He said afterward that four people were heckling him before and after the at-bat.
Puig expressed contrition for having “stooped to their level,” he said on Tuesday night.
Dodgers manager Dave Roberts spoke with Puig before Wednesday's game.
“It was something that he wishes didn't happen,” Roberts said. “It was a reaction of emotion on his part. Bad judgment. I just made it clear that I want to talk about all our players in the context of what they do on the field, not off the field.
“He understood how I felt. It won't happen again.”

President Donald Trump promised Americans “the largest tax cut in our country's history,” but there's not much in Trump's plan to help low-income households. (Photo: Michael Conroy / AP)
Washington — President Donald Trump promised Americans “the largest tax cut in our country's history.” But for low-income households, Trump's plan would amount to crumbs.
The poorest would get an average tax cut of about $60 a year, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center. Middle-income families would get about $300 on average.
“There's no significant benefit for low-income families,” said Elaine Maag, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center. “It's important because when low-income families get money they tend to spend it, putting it right back into the economy. High-income families tend to save it.”
Republicans have backed a budget resolution that would enable Congress to pass a tax package that could add up to $1.5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.
The Tax Policy Center's analysis says most of the tax cuts would go to the wealthiest Americans. For example, the top 1 percent — families making about $700,000 a year — would get an average tax cut of $129,000. Tax breaks targeting the wealthy include lowering the top income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 35 percent, eliminating the alternative minimum tax, and doing away with the federal estate tax, which is only paid by people who inherit multimillion-dollar estates.
Congressional Republicans dispute that their plan will ultimately help wealthy families more than the middle class. They note that the plan unveiled by Trump and GOP leaders last week is incomplete. The plan would reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three, but it doesn't include the income levels for each tax bracket.
The plan would also increase the $1,000 child tax credit, but it doesn't say by how much. Those details are still being worked on.
“There is simply no way for TPC or anyone to deliver these kinds of specific estimates with the information provided in the framework,” said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
“To get their estimates, they filled in blanks with numbers from other proposals, added a pile of exceptionally pessimistic and biased economic assumptions, and came up with a tax plan that, for all intents and purposes, is their own,” said Hatch, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee.
The Tax Policy Center says it filled in the blanks by taking numbers from a tax blueprint released by House Republicans. For example, the analysis assumes that the child tax credit would increase to $1,500.
Republican Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah want to increase the child tax credit to $2,000. Rubio says doubling the credit is the best way to target tax relief for low- and middle-income families.
The main provisions that would affect low-income families are increasing the child tax credit and raising the standard deduction from $6,300 to $12,000. This would be partially offset by eliminating the $4,050 personal exemption.
Also, the lowest tax rate would increase from 10 percent to 12 percent, but the plan doesn't specify the income levels for each tax bracket.
In the Tax Policy Center's analysis, low-income families make less than $25,000 a year. That puts them in the bottom 20 percent of households.
An analysis by the conservative Tax Foundation noted the plan's lack of details. Nevertheless, it found only modest benefits for low-income families, increasing their annual incomes by an average of less than 1 percent.
The liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities argues that if adding to the national debt leads to spending cuts, low-income families could be worse off.
“By increasing deficits and debt, the tax cuts would intensify pressure, likely in the next several years, for steep budget cuts in programs that help low- and middle-income families,” wrote Sharon Parrott, a senior fellow at the center. “Most low- and middle-income children and their families would likely lose more from these budget cuts than they would gain from the tax cuts.”
One reason the poorest families wouldn't get much of a tax break is that many don't pay federal income taxes. About 44 percent of U.S. households pay no federal income tax, according to the Tax Policy Center. Most of these people pay other federal taxes, including payroll taxes.
However, when it comes to the income tax, most low-income families receive tax credits that are greater than the amount of taxes they owe. They receive the tax credits in the form of a tax refund, even though they paid no taxes.
Maag said this would not change under Trump's tax plan.

Roseanne cancelled: Donald Trump breaks silence on race row; calls out ABC for purported media bias
Washington: President Donald Trump on Wednesday broke his silence about the racism row engulfing supporter Roseanne Barr, not to condemn her outburst but to attack ABC television for purported media bias.
The US network on Tuesday cancelled hit sitcom Roseanne, after star Barr fired off a racist tweet against former White House advisor Valerie Jarrett, who was one of Barack Obama's closest aides.
Jarrett revealed that Bob Iger, the head of ABC parent company Disney, telephoned her personally to tell her the network was cancelling the show.
"Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that 'ABC does not tolerate comments like those' made by Roseanne Barr," Trump tweeted Wednesday.
"Gee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn't get the call?"
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders later defended the president, saying that he was hitting out against media bias.
"The president is pointing to the hypocrisy in the media," she said.
"This is a double standard that the president is speaking about. No one is defending her comments. They're inappropriate, but that's what the point that he was making."
When the scandal first broke, the White House had deflected questions with Sanders saying: "We have a lot bigger things going on in the country right now."
Barr, 65 and a vocal Trump supporter who has used Twitter to voice far-right and conspiracy theorist views, took aim at Jarrett in a post that read: "Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby = vj."
She later apologized for what she called a "joke." But ABC said it was canceling the show, condemning her "abhorrent, repugnant" tweet, which was "inconsistent with our values."
"I'm not a racist, I never was & I never will be," Barr tweeted Wednesday, attempting to defend herself against an onslaught of criticism.
"One stupid joke in a lifetime of fighting 4 civil rights 4 all minorities, against networks, studios, at the expense of my nervous system/family/wealth will NEVER b taken from me."
A since-deleted tweet blaming her outburst on a dose of the sleeping pill Ambien, prompted a swift retort from pharma giant Sanofi.
"While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication," tweeted the French pharmaceutical giant in an acerbic post that quickly went viral.
Roseanne had returned to US screens in March after a 21-year hiatus with Barr's character recast as a Trump supporter in a rare depiction of working class life on the US small screen.
The show scored huge ratings and had been renewed for an 11th season following largely positive reviews — including from the president.

Cleveland Cavaliers coach, Tyronn Lue, announced on Monday that he'd be stepping down from his duties to spend more time focusing on his health. Ironically, the surprising news came just one day after he and LeBron James exchanged some heated words on the court:

Meek Mill
Meek Mill will be released from prison today, according to TMZ.
In November, the 30-year-old rapper was sentence to 2-4 years in prison after Judge Genece Brinkley determined that he had violated his probation. Mill's lawyers said the sentencing was unjust and accused the judge of showing “enormous bias” against the rapper. According to Tacopina, Brinkley has repeatedly asked Williams to leave his Roc Nation management in favor of Philadelphia music figure Charlie Mack. The FBI subsequently launched a probe into the allegations.
Today, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania overturned Brinkley's decision.
Mill shared the following statement with TMZ:
“I'd like to thank God, my family, my friends, my attorneys, my team at Roc Nation including JAY-Z, Desiree Perez, my good friend Michael Rubin, my fans, The Pennsylvania Supreme Court and all my public advocates for their love, support and encouragement during this difficult time.”
“While the past five months have been a nightmare, the prayers, visits, calls, letters and rallies have helped me stay positive.”
To the Philadelphia District Attorney's office, I'm grateful for your commitment to justice – not only for my case, but for others that have been wrongfully jailed due to police misconduct. Although I'm blessed to have the resources to fight this unjust situation, I understand that many people of color across the country don't have that luxury and I plan to use my platform to shine a light on those issues. In the meantime, I plan to work closely with my legal team to overturn this unwarranted conviction and look forward to reuniting with my family and resuming my music career.”
This is a developing story…
Brimingham, Alabama: Alabama's race for US Senate settled into church for worship on Sunday, with the minister at a historic black congregation calling the race a life-or-death matter for equal rights, conservatives standing by Republican Roy Moore and others feeling unsettled in the middle.
Speaking at Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church, where four black girls died in a Ku Klux Klan bombing in 1963, the Reverend Arthur Price evoked the civil rights era between hymns. Democratic nominee Doug Jones prosecuted the last two Klansmen convicted in the attack and has attended events at the church, a downtown landmark with twin domed towers.
"There's too much at stake for us to stay home," Price said of Tuesday's election. He didn't endorse Jones from the pulpit but in a later interview called the candidate "a hero" to the congregation and Birmingham.
Despite allegations of sexual misconduct involving teen girls decades ago, Moore isn't being abandoned by worshippers at Montgomery's Perry Hill Road Baptist Church, where Moore spoke at a "God and Country" rally in September before the accusations arose.
Leaving the red-brick building after a service that ended with a hymn and an altar call, Kevin Mims said he didn't believe the claims against Moore. But even if true, he said, they occurred long ago, and Moore is a conservative who stands "on the word of God." "Everyone has to vote their convictions," said Mims, holding a Bible. "My conviction is he's the right man for the job."
Lines aren't so clearly defined elsewhere.
Interviews with a dozen parishioners at Mobile's Ashland Place United Methodist Church, the home church of US Attorney-General Jeff Sessions, turned up neither any Moore defenders nor confirmed votes for Jones. The prevailing mood seemed to be one of frustration over having to choose between a Republican with Moore's baggage and any Democrat.
"I will vote for Judge Moore," said Bill Prine, of Mobile. "I'm not a fan of his, but I'll have to stick with the Republicans."
The candidates also spent time in church. Accompanied by Senator Cory Booker, Representative Terri Sewell, and others, Jones tweeted a photo from More Than Conquerors Faith Church, a large black congregation in Birmingham. Aides to Moore, who has been almost invisible on the campaign trail during the closing days of the race, didn't disclose his whereabouts Sunday.
After church, Jones told supporters in a cramped campaign office that the results of Tuesday's vote would send a message far beyond Alabama's borders. "This is an election to tell the whole world what we stand for," he said, adding: "This campaign, ladies and gentlemen, is on the right side of history."
President Donald Trump weighed in on the race with a phone message that state voters will receive beginning Monday urging them to vote for Moore. "I'm going to make America safer and stronger and better than ever before. But we need that seat; we need Roy voting for us," Trump said in audio of the call provided by the Moore campaign.
Polls show the race too close to call. While Moore had a clear path to victory in a state where no Democrat holds statewide office, the 70-year-old has been fighting for his political life since reports surfaced a month ago that he made sexual advances on teen girls when he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s.
Speaking on CNN on Sunday, Alabama Senator Richard Shelby said allegations that Moore molested a 14-year-old were the "tipping point" in his decision to cast a write-in ballot for a "distinguished Republican" rather than to vote for Moore or Jones. "There's a lot of smoke," Shelby said. "Got to be some fire somewhere."
Roy Moore's chief strategist, Dean Young, tried to tie Moore to the star of President Donald Trump, who remains popular among state Republicans despite low national approval ratings. "If the people of Alabama vote for this liberal Democrat Doug Jones, they're voting against the president, who they put in office at the highest level," Young said on ABC News' This Week with George Stephanopoulos.
In a state considered part of the Bible Belt, the allegations transformed a race into an unexpected referendum on which is better: a man accused of child molestation claims he vehemently denies or a Democrat?
For many conservative Republicans, there's really no choice. "To me, there's only one person in the race, and that's Judge Moore," said David Smith, leaving Perry Hill Baptist with his wife, Cecilia. The two have a recording of Moore's speech earlier in 2017 at their church and sometimes listen to it in the car for inspiration.
At 16th Street Baptist, Merion Turner recalled participating in civil rights marches and was in high school at the time of the bombing. Turner said she would vote for the Democrat on Tuesday, though her choice has little to do with the allegations of sexual misconduct against Moore. "I just don't like all the division in this country right now," she said. "I think Doug Jones would help that."

THE proposed council tax rise of 500 per cent on second homes by the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority lacks evidence to support such a controversial and radical policy.
Before commencing this proposed pilot on an identified ‘at risk' community, a full impact assessment is required.
Otherwise the likelihood of unintended consequences may prevail: villages full of ‘for sale' signs, run-down empty houses, and failing pubs and businesses.
This would lead to a consequential drop in all property values and damage communities that are struggling to survive. Age is the defining feature of most second homes, they require regular significant upkeep and are not ideal homes for first-time buyers.
As second homeowners, we have visited and supported the Yorkshire Dales for the last 60 years: we have a strong family connection to the area as my great-grandfather built the property in the 1800s, and this was inherited from my mother.
Family, now two generations, and friends visit regularly. Family members have lived here for short periods. We've provided work for local tradesmen, from electrical upgrades to modernising and new roofs.
First-time buyers and young families are unlikely to have disposable incomes to do similar work.
We support local amenities, and the local pub thrives on the support of second homeowners who visit when holiday lets are quiet. They also support the community, volunteering in roles which might otherwise remain unfilled, and bring skill sets that are missing within the local population.
YDNP councillors are, understandably, concerned with both a falling and an ageing population. These concerns are reflected nationwide, particularly in rural areas, and not solely related to the Dales. There are alternative solutions rather than adopting a ‘social engineering' measure penalising second homeowners.
Richmondshire District Council has a ring-fenced budget of £2m for the provision of affordable housing: more family friendly homes could be built, and the YDNPA has the ability to relax its planning regulations, and encourage small businesses to move into the Dales.
Without clear specific evidence that second homes are the sole cause of the falling population in the Dales, it cannot be right to target second homeowners. It is discriminatory: it will not achieve its stated aims, but will devastate the housing market and may well speed up the decline it is trying to reverse.

ISLAMABAD - Former President Asif Ali Zardari on Monday expressed profound grief and sorrow over the death of PPP activist Latif Mughal in Karachi after a brief illness.
In a condolence message, Asif Ali Zardari, while paying rich tributes to Latif Mughal said that he had for long struggled against dictatorship of General Ziaul Haq.
“Latif Mughal believed in the philosophy of Bhutto family and struggled all his life for labour rights,” he said.
The former President said that committed, dedicated and loyal workers were asset for the party and Latif Mughal remained a committed and loyal worker all his life.
“He was a true follower of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto. The void left with the death of Latif Mughal will never be filled and he will be long remembered by the PPP leadership and workers alike,” he added.
Zardari expressed his condolences with Latif Mughal's family and said that his thoughts were with the bereaved family.
Meanwhile, PPP Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Secretary Information Senator Rubina Khalid, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly member Nighat Orakzai and Shazia Tehmas paid a visit to the home of Mashaal Khan to express condolence over his death on behalf of Asif Ali Zardari and Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.
Later, the delegation met Inspector General of Police and informed him of the threats to Mashaal Khan's family.
On their demand, the IG police ordered to deploy ladies police at the house of Mashaal Khan.
Senator Rubina Khalid said that Mashaal Khan's murder was a very disturbing and unpardonable incident and the time had come that every citizen should play a role to stop such incidents from happening again.
The Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission are scrutinizing the transaction, with a decision possible in coming weeks. At issue is whether Sinclair, which grew from a single TV station in Baltimore in 1971, can win approval for the purchase of Tribune's 42 stations, including outlets in New York and Los Angeles. The purchase would lift Sinclair's station total to more than 200.

Bigger, better, and modern.
It's all part of the City's plan to give the Blaisdell Center a much-needed facelift. Officials want to turn the Blaisdell into “Honolulu's gathering place.”
It's a 400-million dollar renovation project. Officials say the current Blaisdell Center is outdated, and changes need to be made so it's on the same level as other civic centers.
Improvements include more parking spots, new retail space such as restaurants, a modernized arena, and a larger concert hall.
The renovation project won't start until 2019 at the earliest.
However, it's starting a conversation for those who use the space – some users may get accommodated while others, unfortunately, will not.
The Blaisdell Center was built in the 1960s.
It's been the venue for concerts, farmers markets, and graduations throughout the years.
But the director of the Department of Enterprise Services says it's time for a change.
“It served our community well over 50 years. But we're ready to move forward. This is the 21st century and we need a 21st century facility for our community,” Guy Kaulukukui, director of the Dept. of Enterprise Services, said.
The Hawaii Symphony Orchestra agrees the Blaisdell needs the upgrade, but it worries the projected 2 year renovation project will be catastrophic for the non-profit.
“Right now, most of the plan is focused on the facilities and how best to accomplish those changes. A part of it needs to be the sensitivities that are so reliant on the venue,” Jonathan Parrish, Hawaii Symphony Orchestra, said.
Kaulukukui said the City is working with consultants to come up with the best way to handle the renovations whether through phases or all together.
“The first things we did was have a meeting. We met with our key users, anchor tenants like the symphony, the opera. We brought concert promoters in. Folks who are there on a routine basis. We allowed them to meet with consultants,” Kaulukukui said.
But there is one group of users that will have to find a new alternative, area employees who use the Blaisdell's parking structure.
Several workers at nearby Straub Hospital, Queen's Medical Center, and Hawaiian Electric said it will be hard to find a new place to park because it's hard enough to find parking in town.
“That would probably be the one that's most difficult to avoid because there's a period of time where parking structure will be unavailable. It truly needs to come down. Not only so we can expand but so we can improve the flow of the parking structure,” Kaulukukui explained.
Since the renovations are in its early design stages, the City wants to hear from the public. The next public hearing will be in June.
Guam's leader said on Monday that "sometimes a bully can only be stopped with a punch in the nose", in a spirited defence of President Donald Trump's rhetoric against North Korea, which has the island in its crosshairs.
While Trump's critics accuse him of inflaming tensions with Pyongyang, Guam governor Eddie Calvo said he was grateful the US leader was taking a strong stance against North Korean threats to his Pacific homeland.
"Everyone who grew up in the schoolyard in elementary school - we understand a bully," Calvo told AFP.
"(North Korean leader) Kim Jong-Un is a bully with some very strong weapons... a bully has to be countered very strongly."
Calvo, a Republican, said Trump was being unfairly criticised over his handling of the North Korea crisis, which escalated when Pyongyang announced plans to launch missiles toward Guam in a "crucial warning".
He said North Korea had threatened Guam – a US territory which hosts two large military bases and is home to more than 6,000 military personnel – at least three times since 2013.
Trump has responded by threatening "fire and fury", warning last week that the US military was "locked and loaded" to respond to any aggression.

"President Trump is not your conventional elected leader, what he says and how he says it is a lot different from what was said by previous presidents," Calvo said.
But he pointed out previous presidents had also used strong words to warn off Pyongyang, including Barack Obama who said last year that "we could, obviously, destroy North Korea with our arsenals".
"One president (Obama) said it one way, cool and calmly with a period... the other said fire and fury with an exclamation point, but it still leads to the same message," Calvo said.
He rejected suggestions that Trump and the North Korean dictator were as bad as each other when it came to the sabre-rattling playing out in the western Pacific.
"Well there's only one guy that has vaporised into a red mist his uncle or a general because he fell asleep in a meeting with an anti-aircraft gun, that's Kim Jong-Un," he said.
"There's only one guy that's killed his brother with one of the most toxic nerve agents ever created, that's Kim Jong-Un."
'Safe place to visit'
Some regional players such as China have urged Trump to tone down his rhetoric but Calvo called on them to do more to contain Pyongyang, saying "no-one wants to see a war".
"It's not only in the interests of America and its allies, but also China and Russia to see this fellow does not continue in his effort towards nuclearisation or longer-range missiles," he said.
"You're allowed to voice those opinions without going to prison, whether you're for the military or against it, unlike North Korea," he said.
He acknowledged there were "varying opinions" among Guam's 160,000 residents about the huge US military presence on the island but insisted the majority of inhabitants backed it.
Calvo also dismissed criticism of the US-operated THAAD weapons system, which has been deployed in Guam and is capable of destroying intermediate-range missiles in the final phase of flight.
"It's meant not to shoot people, it's meant to shoot at missiles that kill people," he said.
Calvo said he did not expect the crisis would have a major impact on the island's tourism industry, which draws more than 1.5 million tourists a year.
"Guam's a safe place to go to. Even though all this stuff is going on in the airwaves there has been no added threat level," he said.
"I'm welcoming all the people of the world to come visit Guam; it's a beautiful place."

Two pubs in North Lincolnshire are set to ban plastic straws in the new year in a bid to become more eco-friendly.
From January 2018 drinkers at the White Horse, Brigg, and Blue Bell, Scunthorpe, will also have to ask for biodegradable paper straws.
John Hutson, chief executive of JD Wetherspoon, which operates both pubs, said: “These changes are part of an overall commitment from the company to reduce the amount of non-recyclable waste produced.
“We believe that Wetherspoon pub-goers will welcome this.”
Wetherspoon has previously said the move will help to stop 70 million plastic straws from going to landfill or into the world's oceans every year.
A wider movement by a group called the Plastic Pollution Coalition calls on people to refuse the use of single-use plastic, such as straws.
Straws are thought to take up to 500 years to decompose and moves to cut their use comes after a 5p charge for plastic bags in shops.
Statistics show the introduction of the charge has led to a reduction in the number of bags used of 85 per cent.

A California Energy Commission committee is urging the state to reject a proposal to build a new natural gas plant in Ventura County.
Called the Puente Energy project, the 262-megawatt power plant would be owned and operated by NRG, a Houston-based electricity company. NRG contracted with Southern California Edison to supply power to the utility.
In what the regulators themselves called an “unusual” statement, the two-member committee said that the proposed plant, set for construction on Mandalay Bay in Oxnard, conflicted with state laws and goals for communities and the environment.
“We hereby notify the parties and interested members of the public that we intend to issue a [decision] that recommends denial of the project on the grounds that it creates inconsistencies with LORS [laws, ordinances, regulations or standards] and significant environmental impacts that cannot be mitigated,” Commissioners Janea Scott and Karen Douglas said in their two-page statement.
Southern California Edison said in a statement that the Puente project was competitively chosen and is needed to help meet demand when older power plants close by 2021.
“It is important to remember that the approval for new resources is a very lengthy and costly process, and it is not practical to continually revisit development decisions, as this can make it more difficult to address reliability needs on the system,” Edison stated.
“While there are potential solutions to the needs addressed by the Puente project, it is speculative to assume that preferred resources can be developed on the scale and at the cost needed to competitively replace the Puente project by 2021.”
The recommendation sends the final decision about the project to the full energy commission, but the rare statement all but signals that the power plant plan is dead.
The recommendation follows Los Angeles Times investigations that showed the state has overbuilt the electricity system, primarily with natural gas plants, and has so much clean energy that it has to shut down some plants while paying other states to take the power California can't use. The overbuilding has added billions of dollars to ratepayers' bills in recent years.
Officials in Oxnard, along with state lawmakers who represent the area, have called for clean energy alternatives to the plant. And residents flooded the energy commission with hundreds of emails for days throughout the summer, pressing regulators to reject the project.
California has a mandate that 50% of the state's electricity come from clean energy sources by 2030. Some lawmakers want to increase the mandate to 100%.
In August, the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's electric grid, released a 46-page report detailing that clean energy sources could serve as alternatives to building the natural gas plant. But in its study at the time, Cal-ISO said that the alternatives would cost more than the gas facility.
The report by Cal-ISO, which has argued that additional energy resources are needed in the Oxnard area to ensure reliability in the local area, pegged the new plant's cost at $299 million while the three clean-energy alternatives would cost $309 million to $1.1 billion.
Some critics said that a request for proposals could yield more competitive prices than the Cal-ISO study.
Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, who had joined the opposition to the plant, said rejection of the natural gas facility is crucial for the Oxnard community, which has a substantial low-income population that has been saddled with polluting production plants.
“For decades, corporations have targeted Oxnard as a dumping site, profited from the city's environmental destruction and left behind hazardous waste and pollution that continues to threaten the health and safety of its residents,” Steyer said.
Steyer and others said Californians must continue to support clean energy in the face of the energy industry's push for more fossil fuels.
“California is at a critical and exciting threshold of a clean energy future that will expand clean energy jobs and build healthier communities," said Gladys Limon, executive director of the California Environmental Justice Alliance.

ISLAMABAD, Oct. 6 (APP): Barrister Sultan Mehmood
Choudhary, former Prime Minister of Azad Kashmir and Dr. Ghulam
Nabi Fai, Secretary General, World Kashmir Awareness Forum in
a memorandum submitted to the Secretary General of the
United Nations, Antonio Guterres urged the UN to play a
a leadership role in resolving the 70-year-old Kashmir conflict.
According to information reaching here from New York on
Friday, they maintained that the Kashmir dispute has inflicted
pain, agony, and injustice on a scale that makes East Timor,
and Southern Sudan pale in comparison.more than 100,000 killings in
the past two decades alone, and routine rape, torture,
mutilation, plunder, disappearances, arbitrary detentions,
and ruthless punishment of peaceful political dissent.
Kashmir conflict is perhaps the most dangerous conflict in
the world because of the spiraling nuclear and missile race
between India and Pakistan coupled with historical enmities
that have occasioned three wars between the two rivals.
It is obvious that no settlement can last if it is not based
on justice for the people of Kashmir and recognition of
their inherent rights, they argued.
It is also undeniable that the past 70 years have proven
that bilateral India-Pakistan negotiations to resolve Kashmir
conflict are simply charades that achieve nothing but more strife
and horror stories in Kashmir. A new negotiating formula is
thus urgently required both in the name of international peace,
security and human rights. The element that has been missing
in efforts towards a settlement is the political representation
of Kashmiris on the negotiating table along with India and Pakistan.
The Parties Hurriyet Conference (APHC) that represents
the broader spectrum of the opinion of the Kashmiri people
is unswervingly devoted to a peaceful settlement of the Kashmir
dispute, and is eager to explore constructive approaches
to jump-starting the longstanding Kashmir stalemate that has ensued
when the problem has been perceived as bilateral, to the exclusion of
the 20 million Kashmiri people. As Northern Ireland
required the participation of Sinn Fein in negotiations to
succeed, Kashmir is no different, they argued.
“We completely endorse the statement of the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights who expressed serious concern about the situation in (Indian held) Kashmir and proposed on September 13, 2016
that “an independent, impartial and international mission is
now needed crucially and that it should be given free and complete
access to establish an objective assessment of the claims made by
the two sides. We trust that your personal involvement in
this matter will bring its influence to bear on both India and
Pakistan to initiate a peaceful negotiation with which the
United Nations as well as the genuine leadership of the people of
Jammu & Kashmir will be associated so as to ensure that
settlement arrived at will be based on the principles of justice,
they said in the memorandum”.
“We place the trust in the statesmanship of the Excellency,
as the Secretary General of the United Nations that you will
not countenance any attempt to ignore the wishes of the people of
the State of Jammu and Kashmir and bypass the expression of
those wishes.”

Broccoli has undergone a dramatic image transformation to be crowned Britain's favourite vegetable in a survey from Diabetes UK.
Once the brassica suffered from seriously bad PR and was regarded by many as healthy but horrible. In cartoons and comedy sketches it was often portrayed as the prime example of food detested by children.
But in recent years media attention on the nutritional qualities of broccoli and its re-invention as a "superfood" have won the vegetable a legion of fans.
In the online survey of 2,000 consumers across the UK who were asked to name their favourite vegetable, 12% voted for broccoli.
The vegetable had the biggest share of the vote, beating sweetcorn and tomato which both attracted the support of 10%.
Surprisingly, kale emerged as Britain's least popular vegetable, receiving only 18 votes - less than 1% of the total.
The same poll found that strawberries were the most favoured fruit, chosen by 14% of participants, closely followed by banana, pineapple and mango.
Dan Howarth, head of care at Diabetes UK, which commissioned the survey to promote its "Food You Love" campaign during Diabetes Week, said: "Eating fruit and veg is a great way of getting vital vitamins and fibre and a much healthier snack option than reaching for crisps, cereal bars or even smoothies. They are also low in calories and super filling."
Regionally there were some surprises. Brussel sprouts turned out to be the most popular vegetable in the North West, while people in the North East were passionate for pineapple. Eastern England was the only region to champion the humble pea, voted for by 14%, while Londoners appeared to be mad for mangoes.
The "Food You Love" campaign is aimed at persuading people to eat healthier versions of the food they enjoy.
Broccoli, or Brassica oleracea italica, hails from the Mediterranean and was first cultivated from a cabbage relative by the Etruscans, an ancient Italian civilisation. Its name is derived from the Italian word "broccolo" which means "the flowering crest of a cabbage".
When it was first introduced in England in the mid-18th century, broccoli was known as "Italian asparagus".
Broccoli is a good source of vitamin C and folate. It also contains vitamins A and K, calcium, fibre, beta-carotene and the compounds indole-3-carbinol and sulforaphane that are said to combat cancer.
No. 14 USC (4-1, 2-1 in the Pac-12) vs. Oregon State (1-4, 0-2)
Saturday, 1 p.m., Coliseum. TV: Pac-12 Networks. Radio: 710
Marquee matchup
USC passing game vs. Oregon State's secondary: Last week, the Trojans endured their worst passing game in quarterback Sam Darnold's time as a starter. He completed just 15 attempts for 164 yards, with one interception and no touchdowns. No tight ends or running backs had a reception. Now, USC returns injured starter Steven Mitchell Jr. Oregon State is without two starting cornerbacks. If the passing game doesn't put up big games in this one, when will it?
Getting offensive
USC (459.0 ypg/35.0 ppg): USC's offense has been afflicted with issues in short-yardage situations, problems passing the ball and play calling that has at times been ineffective. The result: USC has had one great offensive game this season, against Stanford, but otherwise production has declined.
Oregon State (321.6 ypg/21.2 ppg): Oregon State is last in the Pac-12 Conference in yardage and scoring. It will likely be without two of its best players. Quarterback Jake Luton has a spine fracture, and there is no timetable for his return. Darell Garretson started against Washington last week and completed just 11 of 22 passes for 74 yards. Running back Ryan Nall hasn't had the breakout season many expected. He has 341 yards in five games, and he is doubtful for Saturday's game with an ankle sprain. If he can't go, he'll be replaced by Artavis Pierce (137 yards this season) and Thomas Tyner (72 yards).
Getting defensive
USC (388.6 ypg/25.8 ppg): USC gave up conversions on eight of 18 third downs against Washington State, including five of eight from 10 yards or longer. USC's pass rush has been a bright spot, with 13 sacks in the last three games. Linebacker Uchenna Nwosu has forced or recovered a turnover on the opponent's goal line in consecutive games.
Oregon State (490.2 ypg/46.4 ppg): Cornerbacks Dwayne Williams and Xavier Crawford are both out. The Beavers have just six sacks and seven forced turnovers in five games. The team leader in tackles for loss is linebacker Manase Hungalu. He has just 3.5. Oregon State ranks 128th out of 130 teams in scoring defense.
Something special
Neither team has been very explosive in special teams, particularly on punt returns. USC has failed to return or even fair catch more than half of the punts it has faced this season. Oregon State's returner, Trevon Bradford, has only one return this season. It went for zero yards.
Of note
Oregon State last defeated USC in Los Angeles in 1960, a 23-game home winning streak for USC. … The Beavers have the ninth-hardest schedule in the nation, according to ratings guru Jeff Sagarin.
Local ties
Oregon State has 27 players from California on its roster, including starting receiver Jordan Villamin (Fontana) and starting cornerback Shawn Wilson (Pomona).
Defensive tackle Marlon Tuipulotu is the only USC player from Oregon, though defensive tackle Brandon Pili, who is from Alaska, attended an Oregon high school for one season.

(Reuters) - Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane has delivered a remarkable trophy haul in his short spell in charge, yet he knows life in the Bernabeu dugout is never secure.
Zidane is set to agree a new deal at the club, according to Spanish media reports, but the French coach said on Saturday that he could be let go at any time whatever the length of contract he signs.
"I know it will end at some point, but I am very happy at the moment," Zidane told a news conference.
"A contract could be 10 years, or 20, but I know where I am and what I must do.
"Maybe in a year's time, I might be gone. I will never argue with Madrid about this. I'm very happy with their confidence in me. The objectives are always the same. We want to win all the games and titles possible."
Zidane is seventh coach in the last 10 years at Madrid, who are notoriously demanding of their managers.
Since being appointed in 2016, the Frenchman has led the club to two Champions League trophies and last season's La Liga title, as well as two UEFA Super Cups and one Club World Cup.
Zidane has the chance on Sunday to take a step towards another trophy, in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup against rivals Barcelona at the Nou Camp.
The Frenchman confirmed striker Cristiano Ronaldo is fit to start, after he appeared from the bench against Manchester United on Tuesday as Madrid won the UEFA Super Cup in Skopje.
"He is very good, he has had his holidays," said Zidane. "He worked very hard physically during his break and he is ready to play now. But we will see the team tomorrow."

Though she may be only 17 years old and all of 5-foot-1, Alicia Hiis is a firecracker. And that is both on the ice and off of it. The young Swedish defender is a multi-sport athlete who is making her first strides in the Svenska damhockeyligan (SDHL) – the top women's league in her country. While she may be one of the younger players to have skated for her club, SDE HF, during the 2017-18 season, she is determined to become an integral player for her team and the league during the years ahead.
The most noticeable aspect of Hiis' game is her physicality, despite weighing only 110 pounds. She is built very solidly and has a low center of gravity in her compact form. Hiis has utilized her build and positioning to not only bring an aggressive style to her team, but has even been known to throw her body around. While hitting is not allowed in women's hockey – and Hiis has at times needed to remind herself of that – there is no question that her rougher style of play makes a statement.
THW had the chance to speak with her one-on-one and learn a bit more about the fearless blueliner. We may even go as far as considering her the female version of a “little ball of hate”, a moniker bestowed on very few but one that certainly does justice to her kind of play. We think that by the time you have finished reading about her, you are going to like Hiis as much as we do, and you will wish that she was on your favorite hockey club.
Still Very Much a Kid Herself
Hiis turned 17 on Feb. 1, 2001. Given when she started playing hockey, she honestly has not been playing the game very long. This makes it even more admirable that she has already made it to the SDHL. Hiis explained that her original roots in hockey stem from the sport of bandy, which is a game that is quite similar.
“I started playing hockey when I was 10 years old,” Hiis told THW. “There were really two reasons why. One was because I played bandy, which is also a skating and stick sport. But I got tired of that, and since I've always been an aggressive player, my dad suggested hockey. I got interested in hockey, but my dad also told me that when I played soccer in for the club AIK, they told me that I had to quit bandy because they wanted me to focus on soccer. I was only 10 years old then, and I didn't accept that I should choose to quit a sport. So, for some reason I told my dad that since they don't want me to play bandy, then I want to play hockey. Maybe a lot of kids works that way – you tell them one thing, and they end up doing a whole other.”
Blir det fotboll eller hockey för backtalangen Alicia Hiis? ”Känner att jag är ganska bra på båda” @hockeysverige @sdehockeydam https://t.co/bJfLWAfAUE pic.twitter.com/GwjpoIUUqd — Ronnies Skrivsmedja (@skrivsmedjan) November 13, 2017
If you have not garnered it already, you will soon realize that Hiis is very strong-willed. It is hard to not agree with her – why should a child be forced to quit a sport so young? As her 10-year-old self recognized the injustice of it all, Hiis stood firm and did things her way. This ended up being the profoundly right decision for her, as she has excelled in hockey ever since.
Growing up in Sweden
Currently living in the capital of Sweden, Hiis has spent most of her life in Bromsten – a middle-class district of northwestern Stockholm. The municipality of Stockholm has a population of over 950,000, while a few million are living in the urban and metropolitan areas of the city.
“I live in Stockholm and I've always lived here,” Hiis explained. “When I was a little kid I used to live in a suburb called Tensta, but then my parents got divorced and I have basically lived my whole life in Bromsten with my dad. There's one hockey team called Spånga, and the rink is about seven minutes from my house, so it was an easy choice.”
Bromsten actually belongs to the Spånga-Tensta borough of Stockholm, hence the hockey team of said name and nearby rink. Hiis has lived in both locations within the borough.
Making the Most of Limited Opportunities
As far as hockey goes though, the opportunities for a young girl to play the sport in this area have been about average for Hiis, and likely even a little less. With the influx of the “Grow the Game” mentality that is being strongly promoted by NWHL teams, CWHL teams, and women's national teams in North America, there should be some thoughts of appreciation for the way that the women's game has encompassed support for young girls in recent years, specifically in this part of the globe. Especially when considering that the same support is not always found worldwide. For Hiis and other players in Europe, a struggle of sorts has been real.
“As a girl there are okay opportunities to play hockey here.” Hiis would go on to explain, “It all depends on what coach you have. Some have given me the same opportunities as the boys. But others I would say have been a real problem in my career, and that's because I played with the boys from when I was 10 to 16. So, it can really effect the players development if you treat them different from the rest of the group. I went to play with the J-18 team (a boys junior team in Sweden) when I was fifteen. But after we switched coaches it was, in my opinion, no longer about how good or bad I was, but the fact that I was a girl. So I didn't play for about a whole year when having that coach. I won't lie – that year I lost a lot of motivation and ‘gained' of course doubts about me as a player, but also doubts about if it was right of me as a female to play hockey. And the fact that no one in the club wanted to confront him about it, I wouldn't say that it's a good opportunity for a girl to play hockey here. At least not if you want to play on the same terms as the boys.”
You certainly have to respect Hiis's candidness and her ability to recognize, that at least in this particular instance, she was sold short because she is a female hockey player. Wise beyond her years, one would have to say that not playing Hiis was more of a loss for the team.
Finding a Place for Herself in the SDHL
Unlike a lot of young athletes, Hiis has not looked up to a particular player or found one whom she tries to model her game after. Instead, she has geared her focus towards observing different skills or body checks she has enjoyed, and then used those for adding inspiration to her own play.
“Oh I´m not really a player that follows the NHL or other leagues”, Hiis shared. “I know that might sound bad, but I just really don't feel like putting in time to watch any games. Usually I might have homework or soccer, so I can't really find the time to follow a team or a specific player. But I usually just watch skills or hits on YouTube, because then I can decide by my own when to watch and learn. When I was younger and played in the J18, I used to look at the older and more experienced players. The biggest thing I think is just confidence on the ice. You might be stressed out in a specific situation but to keep your cool. That's what the better players do. I think that's one of the many things I noticed while watching some of the J18 guys.”
Since the 2014-15 season, Hiis played women's Division I hockey, which is the tier just below the SDHL. In 48 Division I games, Hiis scored six goals and nine assists while picking up a whopping 72 penalty minutes. Her finest season statistically came during the 2016-17 season for AIK 2 when she scored six goals and five assists for 11 points in 22 games, to go along with 34 penalty minutes.
Hiis admits her feistiness, acknowledging that her hard hitting against boys has carried over into the women's game. This desire to hit and play in-your-face hockey has led her to acquiring more penalties, but has also made her presence known.
“Yes, going from playing with the boys to playing women's hockey, the hardest part was just getting used to ‘no' (hits).” Hiis would go onto explain, “my best skill might be hitting, and since that's the one thing you can't do in women's hockey it has been a quite difficult in my way of playing. I've now gotten used to not making an open ice hit, but it sill is one of my favorite things to do. That's one reason why I miss playing boys hockey. Another strength I have is that I'm a good skater. Maybe I got that a little bit from bandy, but for most part it's just repetition. My best characteristic might be that I like to practice – I appreciate a gym session. Well it's not always fun, but you get it – I do appreciate having a lot of training.”
Still Learning the Game and Plenty of Time to Make Decisions
During the 2017-18 SDHL season, Hiis played 15 games for SDE out of the team's 36 total contests. Although she went pointless, she still finished the year as a minus-two. Normally that number might seem a bit paltry, but SDE finished second to last in the SDHL and scored a league worst 54 goals. After allowing 137 goals, the team finished the year as a minus-83. Hiis' plus/minus was actually the best total of all skaters on the team of those that had played at least 10 games.
Despite the record, Hiis feels that SDE suits her perfectly. The club has also given her the opportunity to continue a successful career in soccer too, in addition to hockey.
“I go to a high school that's called Danderydsgymnasium, which is nearby the SDE rink,” Hiis told us. “Also, for this season I wanted to challenge myself a bit, or maybe step up my game. I decided to go for a SDHL team. But since there are three teams in the SDHL in Stockholm, and the other two teams weren't an option for me by the time, I chose SDE. Also, one of my biggest priorities is that my coach has a good attitude about me also playing soccer. In SDE I have been able to play both soccer and hockey. Some coaches are not up for a player having another sport but really, I just think it's better that a player is at practice developing, even if it's not the same sport. You still get to work on other muscle groups or skills that might be useful. Also, it's better that the player shows character and ambition than doing other stuff like maybe partying on the weekends, but maybe that's just me.”
Hiis also feels that there is more she will be able to contribute to SDE next year. She is only 17 years old age, and is playing in a league with some women who are about twice her age. Hiis, however, is staunch in doing her darndest and going with the approach that she can contribute more.
“Well perhaps taking one step up in my game,” she said, when asked what she is most looking forward to for the 2018-19 SDHL season. “I think I did okay this year, but I´d like to say that I got more to give. Also, maybe us as a team doing better this year I think a lot of the girls are exited for showing what we can do next season.”
Hiis Is Growing as an Athlete and as a Person
11 or 12 year old hockey players are not much younger than Hiis is now, but she has come a long way in her game. As you may have gathered too, she is a very determined young lady. One of Frank Sinatra's most famous and beloved tunes is “My Way”. One thing that can be said for certain about Alicia Hiis is that she is doing things her way. Even at an early age, she has already developed a strong sense of self-awareness.
It is a wisdom too, that she is willing to impart to youngsters. THW asked Hiis if she had any advice for young female hockey players about to enter their teenage years. She offered a rather thorough response.
“I wouldn't say ‘don't be afraid'. That's like saying ‘don't be angry' to someone who's angry. Accept the fact that you are a little nervous, but that you have nothing to lose. I have tried all different types of sports. I've tried ballet, basketball, swimming, boxing and that's just four of about fifteen different sport I've tried. Some of them were not for me, but as an example, I still do boxing now and then. I gained so much from participating in different environments and I've met so many people on the way, and I'm glad I did. No one's great at the beginning of something. What matters is if it fulfills your days with joy and you're growing as a person. I would like to say that my confidence is somehow linked to the sports I've played. I wished more kids would be exposed to different types of sports, because maybe their youth years would've been a whole lot of easier. The teenagers I know that party a lot and tried alcohol at an early age, they're just insecure. And maybe if they would've had something that they feel they are good at, for example a sport such as hockey, they would be more confident with themselves.”
Rather sizable thoughts from someone so young, but she knows what she is talking about. Hiis has also incorporated more of a Muay Thai kickboxing training into her off-ice work, as opposed to traditional boxing. The kickboxing has not only helped with her confidence, but certainly has carried over into balance and strength in her hockey playing.
Some Final Thoughts From Hiis
The best is yet to come for Alicia Hiis. It will be interesting to see how much she has grown heading into the 2018-19 SDHL season, and what more she will bring to SDE. This is a particularly strong blueliner who has no hesitation in being punishing on the ice. To each their own, but it is a shame that hitting is not presently allowed in women's hockey. Hiis would be more of a great white shark out there, capable of delivering some devastating hits. For now, she will need to keep herself in check.
Hockey and sports have taught Hiis a lot already, but as a practitioner of the game she is always eager to learn more.
“I've learned that if you want to be good at something the number one key is repetition,” Hiis explained, “and you have got to have discipline. That means maybe choosing a practice or studying, before being with friends or partying. That does not have to mean that you can never be with a friend or not have fun. That just means that you must make your priorities, and do so wisely. I've also learned that everything isn't always fair, but you can do nothing other than to keep going. I feel like you mature faster, in some sort of way than people at the same age. Maybe because as an athlete you have to take more responsibilities for your training, and that has an impact in your personality to also take responsibility for other stuff such as school.”
Wise words from a tough athlete. Or as we like to call Alicia Hiis, our “Swedish Little Ball of Hate”.
Moondance Records, the iconic downtown music shop on George Street in Peterborough, is playing its final farewell tune.
After 46 years in business, owner and music aficionado Mike Taveroff says it's time to close shop as he announced his retirement.

“I think everybody knows online sales overtook physical sales last year and so I said, ‘This is it,'” said Taveroff. “Things have slowed down a lot in the last few years.”
The 68-year-old says he's been wrestling with the idea of when to retire and after nearly five decades in business, as sales continue to decline on top of the 12-hour days in the store, this was as good a time as any.
He'll look back fondly on the years in business and the connections he made with the customers in the store.
“I'm lucky, I got to do something I always wanted to do and I've always been into tunes,” he said. “And this fed my habit so to speak.”
On Friday afternoon, a handful of music lovers thumbed their way through the vast record collection.
When he was 22 years old, Taveroff set up a record shelf in his late wife's clothing store called Moondance, a tribute to the Van Morrison song. Taveroff says there were people lining up just to view the albums and in this, he saw an opportunity and decided to open his own store.

Back in the store's heyday, he says people used to hang around the shop to listen and talk about music — today, it's not the same.
“Back in the day, people were collectors, unlike today,” he says. “And guys would come in for hours, literally and of course, they would walk out with four or five LPs.”
Taveroff prided himself on playing eclectic and unique music that you couldn't find on the radio.
The shop will officially close on April 28.
São Paulo (Reuters) - Brazilian planemaker Embraer said in a securities filing on Friday it has not received any official new proposal from Boeing about a possible tie-up, but said it is in talks about a joint venture that could create a third company.
A Brazilian government source told Reuters the latest proposal for a tie-up between Boeing Co (BA.N) and Embraer SA (EMBR3.SA) included the creation of a third company. But Embraer said in its filing that no deal is guaranteed.
JAKARTA:- A strong 6.4-magnitude earthquake hit off the Indonesian island Sumatra on Sunday but there was no tsunami risk, seismologists said as panicked residents fled their homes. The quake hit at a depth of 35 kilometres (22 miles) at 10:08 am (0308 GMT) 73 kilometres west of Bengkulu, according to the United States Geological Survey. “The earthquake was quite strong and shallow, it was felt all the way to Padang, West Sumatra, but there was no threat of a tsunami,” Mochammad Riyadi, an official at Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency told .
BEIJING, Feb 2 (Reuters) - HNA-Caissa Travel Group Co Ltd , a unit of China's beleaguered HNA Group , said on Friday it would scrap its share private placement plan mainly due to changes in regulations and market conditions.
HNA-Caissa Travel had planned to raise up to 3.09 billion yuan ($492 million) via the private placement, which it had revised three times from an original plan for up to 8.0 billion yuan announced in 2016.
The tourism service company will apply to withdraw its proposal from the securities regulator, it said in a filing to Shenzhen stock exchange on Friday. Trading in its shares has been suspended since January 19.
Since late 2016, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has been tightening its approval process for private placements to clamp down on speculative acquisitions, money misuse and irrational share valuations.
HNA-Caissa is one of many units of HNA Group, an aviation-to-financial services conglomerate which has been scrutinized over its ownership structure recently.
BEIJING - China's industrial output, a key engine of growth, slowed sharply in July as government efforts to rein in debt weighed on demand and economic activity, official data showed Monday.
The figures come as the authorities have sought to tighten regulations to tame debt as well as reduce excess capacity left over from massive government-backed infrastructure spending at the height of the global financial crisis.
Output by Chinese factories and workshops grew by a lower-than-expected 6.4 percent compared to the same month last year, the national statistics bureau said.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had expected growth of 7.1 percent for July after industrial production expanded by 7.6 percent in June.
Retail sales, meanwhile, slowed slightly to 10.4 percent last month, compared to 11 percent in June, while fixed asset investment posted 8.3 percent growth in the January-July period -- both slightly below expectations.
"In general, the national economy was generally steady in July with continued positive momentum and deepening structural reform," national statistics bureau spokesman Mao Shengyong said at a news conference.
"But we also see that the international circumstance is still complicated and fluid, domestic structural conflicts still stand out, and there are still a lot of hidden concerns."
Mao said industrial production was affected by the weather -- high temperatures and floods -- and efforts in some regions to speed up the reduction of excess capacity that does not meet environmental rules. Economic growth could slow by up to 0.2 percentage points in the second half of the year, Mao said.
While China has posted better-than-expected second quarter growth of 6.9 percent, economic analysts have warned that the momentum will not last as authorities clamp down on debt.
Property development investment eased between January and July, signalling that the government's tightening policies "have finally trickled down through the economy," according to ANZ Research in Hong Kong.
Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, said Monday's figures provided "mixed signals" as growth in electricity and steel output accelerated while production of consumer goods and most other commodities slowed.
"The upshot is that both foreign and domestic demand appear to have softened at the start of (the third quarter)," Evans-Pritchard said.
"A few sectors, such as steel, seem to have defied this slowdown in economic activity. But the strength in these areas likely won't last given that policy tightening is set to further weigh on infrastructure and property investment in coming months," he said.
But Betty Rui Wang, senior China economist at ANZ, said the slowdown is likely to be temporary as the bad weather was partly to blame for July's industrial output.
"We expect a rebound in the upcoming months," she said.
China's economy faces another looming challenge as US President Donald Trump was due to sign on Monday a memorandum to launch an investigation into the Asian giant's intellectual property practices.
Trump will direct US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to determine whether any Chinese laws, policies or practices discriminate against or harm American innovators and technology companies, US officials said.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, bluntly accused China of "stealing our intellectual property" -- long a concern of Western companies seeking a share of the enormous Chinese market.
Responding to the looming probe, China's foreign ministry said on Monday: "Fighting a trade war has no future. There will be no winner, and everybody will lose."

Islamabad
The Supreme Court on Monday reiterated that those facilitating Rao Anwar and others accused in the Naqeebullah case, will not be spared.
The warning was delivered by Chief Justice Saqib Nisar on Monday as a three-member bench resumed the suo motu case of Naqeebullah Mehsud's extra-judicial murder and the hunt for Anwar.
During the hearing, CJP Nisar stated that if Anwar comes to court he will be provided security and he will be safe. CJP also wondered who had provided Anwar help at the airport and stated those helping him will not be spared by the court. Inspector General Sindh AD Khawaja told the court that Anwar was provided a boarding pass of a private airline.
On January 13, 2018, Anwar killed an innocent Naseemullah Mehsud alias Naqeebullah along with three others in a ‘staged encounter' with the Malir police. Since then, Anwar has been dismissed and is currently wanted by the police.
According to Anwar, Naqeebullah had links with the banned TTP and was living in Karachi's Sohrab Goth area using a fake name.
However, the family member Naqeebullah claim that he was an aspiring model and was killed in a fake police encounter.
Chief Justice Nisar remarked during the hearing that strict action would be taken against those found facilitating Anwar's bid to escape the country or giving him shelter. If Anwar surrenders himself to the court, he will be protected, the chief justice observed.
When Sindh Inspector General of Police AD Khawaja was asked who issued Anwar a boarding pass, when he made a botched attempt to fly abroad from Islamabad airport, Khawaja replied that the private airline had issued him a boarding pass. The chief justice then summoned the relevant officials of the airline.
During the hearing, the chief justice also from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor, who was present in court, whether Anwar's bank accounts have been frozen.
Replying in the affirmative, the SBP governor said two of the suspended police officer's bank accounts have been seized. Responding to the chief justice's question if the officer's salary is being deposited in his accounts, the SBP chief replied in the affirmative, adding that the officer, however, cannot withdraw his salary. The hearing was then adjourned until later today when Khawaja was directed to give an in-camera briefing to the court regarding the CCTV footage of Anwar's failed attempt to flee the country in late January.
Later in the day, Khawaja completed the first part of his briefing around 3pm and will hold another session in the evening.
You'd have to forgive Taylor Jensen for his belated response to our request for an interview. After a whirlwind series of events last week in Taiwan—which saw Jensen fall in the quarterfinals, only to have to battle for the title in a rare surf-off (the second such scenario in WSL history)—the newly crowned 2017 Men's Longboard World Champ recently returned to his home in Oceanside, where he battled jet-lag as his rambunctious four-year-old, Jagger, vied for his attention, all while the recent spat of California wildfires threatened to spoil whatever homecoming he had hoped to enjoy.
When he did get back to us, we were stoked to catch up with the soon-to-be 34-year old and pick his brain about the state of professional longboarding, the pitfalls of single-fin-centric thinking, his roller-coaster ride to a third World Title, and his plans for a title defense in 2018.
So this one came down to the wire–the 2nd surf off for a title in the history of the WSL. What was going through your head after your quarterfinal exit?
I read that too. I think the first one was Caio Ibelli and Garret Parkes for the World Junior Title. It definitely made for an exciting finish to a year and hopefully it's good for longboarding as a whole. The odds of it happening in a WCT ten-stop tour scenario are super small, but when you're on a Longboard Tour that currently only consists of two events, the possibility becomes much more of a reality. Maybe that's where the whole new WCT format is heading with the Indo finish. No early crowning, more drama, more excitement. It makes sense.
Losing out in the quarterfinals really sucked. In round four earlier that morning, I had a heat total of 18+ and was throwing away 9's and 8's, but a lot seemed to change in the next few hours. The wind came up and the swell just stopped. There was only one wave right at the start of that heat and then nothing else came through for the next 25 minutes. Phil [Rajman] adapted and started groveling on smaller waves to make scores. I stuck it out and waited for sets. Unfortunately, I got nothing and lost. That's the nature of surf contests and an unpredictable ocean. You make decisions and sometimes they are not the right ones.
I honestly thought that was it. I knew in the back of my mind that there was still a slim chance [that I might get a shot at the title], but with all eight of the top surfers remaining in the event at that stage, it wasn't likely. I was pretty bummed out. Then I was sitting in my car, pissed off and dealing with the loss when I watched the number 2,3, and 4 guys lose in the quarters, too. Suddenly it all seemed to shift back to my favor.
The waves in the final were super chunky, lots of texture. How did the conditions dictate your approach?
Honestly, I was just trying to find something that either didn't close out or didn't go fat. The conditions had really deteriorated by the time that surf-off started. Maybe one in 20 waves had a six or better in it. Everything else was junk. Of course with longboarding, noseriding is key, but I try and focus my surfing more on the overall flow and allowing the wave to dictate what needs to be done when and where. Forcing maneuvers in where they don't belong or having some pre-planned approach to a wave can make for some pretty ugly surfing. I feel like all waves have a sort of rhythm to them and if you can flow to that rhythm then your surfing will look better and you'll be rewarded for it.
You said this world title was “the sweetest” of your now three titles. What made this one so special?
The first two were amazing in their own ways and maybe I shouldn't have said this is the sweetest, because they are all pretty incredible moments for me. I think the five-year gap in between my previous titles and this one has a lot to do with this one feeling like I put a bit more into it. In the past two years, I've had a 2nd and a 3rd. I think I might have lost by .03 and .05 on the last waves of the heat in both of those events—heartbreaking losses that really got to me and took a toll on me. I was extremely frustrated and I let that frustration fuel the fire in the lead up to this event. So the sense of accomplishment and the release of all that buildup was pretty crazy. I set the goal of getting three titles in 2012 after I got my second. Five years of working toward that goal and finally accomplishing it is really rewarding.
Can you comment on the state of the WSL Longboard Tour?
This year we had two events. The past few years we've only had one event. When I started doing the Longboard Tour in 2001 there were five events. Obviously the global financial crisis was a major factor in the decline in the number of events—everyone around the world was hit hard, so it was only natural to see all surfing feel the crunch. While the WCT has since rebounded with investors and the change over to the WSL from the ASP, longboarding hasn't seen the rewards from that. Possibly because the WSL has been too busy getting the ‘CT going and possibly because they just don't have anyone in the WSL team dedicated to looking after the longboard side of things like they should have.
There have been some changes discussed and thrown around (going single-fin, exclusively, for example). What would the three-time champ like to see change?
I feel like the talk of going strictly single-fin was just talk. Someone jumped the gun and put it out there. From a business standpoint, that would be a silly move. Longboarding is already seen as a niche in the market so why would you go and cut your market audience in half by only appealing to a smaller percentage. That doesn't make any sense. It's also ridiculous to try and tell someone what they can or can't ride. Think about that for a second. You have someone out there saying, "now you can only ride one type of board with one fin setup." That's such a close-minded approach to surfing and goes against the "ride everything" or "ride the right board for the right conditions" mentality that I believe in. It's detrimental to evolution and creativity. Imagine if the WSL came along and told the WCT surfers you now can only ride six-foot thrusters in every location. It's absurd.
Right now there's a generation of longboard kids out there for who bought into the whole single-fin only mentality and they never learned how to turn a board. I feel for them because it's not their fault, they just listened to one piece of the much bigger story. Look at what's starting to happen in the traditional single-fin events. How do they separate the surfing from a judge's perspective when everyone can hang ten forever? It comes down to who does better turns. CJ Nelson won the Mexi Logfest and the DuctTape in Sayulita this year because he turns better than anyone else on a log. It's a testament to the fact that he's grown up riding everything imaginable so he knows how to set a rail and draw a turn. Now guys are putting hard edges on their logs, making them super refined and using lightweight carbon and epoxy construction. It's almost a re-re-evolution. It seems like it will just repeat the past until we end up back where we were in the late '90s and early 2000's when guys were riding high-performance single-fins like what Colin Mcphillips won his first World Title on. Then the natural evolution is to add some side fins so you can turn on a sharper angle in a tighter radius.
There has to be room for multiple approaches on a longboard, right?
Look, I'm a huge fan of the traditional side of longboarding. I ride a log all the time when the conditions are right for one and I love watching guys like Burch, CJ, Quintal, and Tyler surf their logs. That's all about style, finesse, positioning and trim. But those guys are an exception because they are extremely well-rounded surfers on all crafts. You can't compare or put that in the same pot as modern longboarding. They both deserve their own platform. That's how we came up with the format for the Surf Relik Invitational we hosted at Malibu in early October. The group at Untitled arts in Malibu sat down with CJ and me to create a new platform for longboarding, one where traditional and modern were separate and equal—no discrimination, no divide, no bullshit, just good surfing. Each had their own large prize purse and each had their own judges and own criteria. It gave everyone a chance to sit back and have some respect and admiration for what each other was doing. Regardless of how you want to ride a wave, you can appreciate the difficulty and skill it takes to excel at any approach. To me, that's the best way to present longboarding to the broader market.
You've got a little one at home. You're nearly 34. What are your plans for a title defense in 2018 and beyond?
Yep, I'm a father to my beautiful 4-year old Jagger with my wife Nava. I'll be 34 in March. You know it's funny, if you had asked me before this event, I wasn't sure what was next. But right now I'm feeling hungrier than ever to keep improving. I don't think it matters where you are at in your surfing; there is always room for some improvement. Ultimately that's probably why we are all hooked on it for life. There's no end to the progress. There's no graduation ceremony or titles. You simply keep improving and learning something every time you enter the water. I want to get back into a jersey and get back into contest mode already. Maybe I just needed this win to get over the frustration of coming close so many times and just missing out, but I'm psyching on going for another title. Four would be insane and at 34 I have years left ahead of me to try and accomplish that. I think Bonga [Perkins] won his 2nd World Title at close to 40. Longboarding is not “extreme” like shortboarding so the longevity of ones career is a lot longer if they take care of themselves and continue to try and improve and stay relevant. I'm also excited to continue working with Untitled Arts and the people behind “Surf Relik” to create more events like the one in Malibu. I feel like we are paving a path and creating a platform for the future generations of longboard surfers to have more opportunities at making a career out of such a beautiful lifestyle.

an investigation is underway to determine if it is related to Lelia Faulkner's disappearance (Source: WSFA 12 News)
Authorities are trying to find out who would stab the billboard (Source: WSFA 12 News)
Authorities are trying to find out who would stab a billboard featuring missing Pike County woman Lelia Faulkner.
According to Lelia Faulkner's mother Susan Faulkner, someone took two 12-inch knives and stabbed the billboard located off Highway 231.
"We've gone through a lot since she's been missing," said Faulkner
Faulkner has four small billboards showing her daughter's faces around the county.The road signs contain hotline numbers as well as reward money information.
"They stabbed seven or eight times. They left the knife sticking in Lelia's face," Faulkner said.
This billboard is located at the corner of Highway 231 South and Pike County Road 3304 across from the Pike County Cattlemen's Association.
"We kind of feel like it may be a threat because we won't stop talking about it," said Faulkner.
Pike County investigators say the billboard stabbings appear to be unrelated to the Lelia Faulkner case, but they also added anything could change. It's still early in the investigation. The other knife was found among the weeds below the sign on the ground.
Detectives recovered both 12-inch knives and dusted for fingerprints. So far, those prints are inconclusive because of smudge on the handles. Authorities are wondering who might carry knives like these.
"It's something no one carries on them, what I call butcher knives," said Pike County Sheriff's Department Lt. Troy Johnson.
Lt. Johnson says they think they have an idea who did this but declined to elaborate until they get more facts in the case.
We first profiled Lelia Faulkner's case back in December. The family has since upped the reward to $10,000 for any information on the whereabouts of Faulkner.

A school leaver's chances of going to university depend heavily on where they live, new figures suggest.
Teenagers in London are around 25% more likely to go into higher education than their peers across England, according to new data published by Ucas.
On average, a third (33.3%) of 18-year-olds in England went on to study for a degree this autumn, the university admissions service statistics show.
But a breakdown reveals significant regional differences.
The highest university entry rate was in the capital, where more than two fifths of 18-year-olds (41.8%) were accepted on to degree courses this autumn.
"This means 18-year-olds from London were more likely than 18-year-olds anywhere else in England (and the UK more generally) to be accepted into higher education this year," Ucas said.
The South East had the second highest entry rate, at 33.7%.
Every other English region had entry rates lower than the overall rate for the nation, the Ucas figures show, although in each case, apart from one, the entry rate was over 30%.
The region with the lowest proportion of school leavers going on to university this year was the South West at 28.9%.
This means that 18-year-olds in London were around 44% more likely to go on to study for a degree this year than those studying in the South West, Ucas said.
The figures for the other English regions were: North East 30.3%, North West 32.9%, Yorkshire and the Humber 31.6%, East Midlands 30.3%, West Midlands 31.6% and the East of England 32.9%.
The statistics also show Northern Ireland had an entry rate of 34.5%, while in Wales it was 29.4% and in Scotland 25.9% - although Ucas does not record all higher education in Scotland.
Clare Marchant, Ucas chief executive, said: "A common theme to emerge from our analysis of data from the 2017 cycle is that the entry rate of 18-year-olds to higher education has increased across all parts of the UK.
"This trend is most pronounced in London. There have been significant and much-documented improvements to secondary education in the capital. Understanding how to replicate this high level of attainment could help drive increases in entry rates elsewhere."
Apple Inc on Monday confirmed it had reached a deal to acquire Shazam Entertainment Ltd, the UK-based app that lets users identify songs by pointing a smartphone at the audio source.
Apple did not give a price for the acquisition. Technology news website TechCrunch reported the deal on Friday with a price of as much as $400 million, far short of the most recent $1 billion valuation for privately held Shazam.
Apple said Shazam would be a “natural fit” with its Apple Music streaming service and it would help users discover new songs. Apple Music has 27 million users and competes against Spotify Ltd, which has 60 million users. Apple said Shazam's team would be joining the Cupertino company.
In a statement, Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said Shazam “is used by hundreds of millions of people around the world, across multiple platforms. ... We have exciting plans in store, and we look forward to combining with Shazam upon approval of today's agreement.”
Apple did not elaborate on its plans, but the company will not be able to make any major changes to Shazam until it secures regulatory approval. Shazam is also available on Android-based devices, but Apple did not say whether it would keep the Android version available. Shazam ended support for a version of its software that runs on Microsoft Corp's Windows PCs earlier this year.
“There's an energy and an optimism that those kids bring with them when they are performing,” Neisser said. “Life in those townships is not easy … but you do not get that bleakness when you are with those kids.”
HONG KONG -Asia stocks retreated Monday as tensions on the Korean peninsula weighed on sentiment, but data showing China's GDP growth was higher than expected in the first quarter was a positive sign for the world's second largest economy.
Tensions between Pyongyang and Washington have soared in recent weeks as a series of North Korean weapons tests have wrought ever-more bellicose warnings from US President Donald Trump's administration. During a visit to the heavily militarised border between the two Koreas, Vice President Mike Pence said America was ruling nothing out in its dealings with the hermit state, a day after Pyongyang failed in its attempt to test another missile.
Trump last week ordered a naval strike group led by the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier to the region, though the vessels remain a long way from the peninsula. Tokyo stocks led markets lower -- extending four days of losses -- as the growing tensions stoked demand for the safe-haven yen.
A stronger yen is generally bad for Japanese shares as it dents exporters' profitability. "Geopolitical risk will continue to be closely monitored today as a strapping US Navy Armada moves within striking distance of North Korea," said Stephen Innes, senior trader at forex firm OANDA.
"With all the military adventurism in play, those insidious wartime market correlations take force as the risk-off theme grips markets. "To what extent the markets need to price in geopolitical risk more actively into their psyche will likely drive nearer term sentiment." The benchmark Nikkei 225 index, which closed at a 2017 low on Friday, lost another 0.3 percent by the lunch break. Taipei and Manila also fell 0.3 percent, while Jakarta dropped 0.2 percent and Singapore declined 0.8 percent. Hong Kong and Sydney were closed for a holiday.
China markets also declined despite government figures showing signs of stabilisation in the world's second largest economy.
Growth of 6.9 percent for the first quarter of 2017 was better than the median analyst expectation of 6.8 percent in an AFP poll.
"The national economy in the first quarter has maintained the momentum of steady and sound development," the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement. It added that "positive changes kept emerging and major indicators performed better than expected".
The economy grew 6.7 percent in 2016, its slowest rate since 1990. The government has trimmed its 2017 GDP growth target to "around 6.5 percent" as the economy faces an array of challenges. The Asian giant is a crucial driver of global growth but leaders are trying to reduce its reliance on exports and state-backed investment and instead focus on domestic consumer spending to drive expansion.
Monday data also showed China's industrial output growth rose to 7.6 percent year-on-year in March, beating an estimate of 6.3 by Bloomberg News. Retail spending grew a forecast-beating 10.9 percent, while fixed-asset investment rose 9.2 percent in the first three months of the year, representing a slight acceleration from February.
REUTERS - U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated their mutual commitment to denuclearize the Korean peninsula during a phone conversation on Friday, the White House said in a statement.
Trump and Xi also agreed that the recent adoption of a United Nations Security Council resolution on North Korea was an important step toward achieving peace and stability on the peninsula, it added.
"President Trump and President Xi agreed North Korea must stop its provocative and escalatory behavior," the statement said.
The White House said the "relationship between the two presidents is an extremely close one, and will hopefully lead to a peaceful resolution of the North Korea problem."
A child plays the game "Honour of Kings" by Tencent at home in Dezhou, Shandong province, China July 2, 2017.
HONG KONG (Reuters) - With as many active players as the population of Germany, the Honour of Kings mobile game will likely help boost Tencent's quarterly revenue by about 50 percent, shrugging off play-time curbs imposed by the firm to address addiction woes.
The fantasy role-playing game based on Chinese historical characters has become so popular that Tencent had to introduce curbs on play time last month amid reports of serious addiction among children. But the restrictions have spawned grey online markets in game accounts, snapped up by younger players trying to find a way to get around the limits.
The growth momentum in China is expected to continue as Tencent taps the 938 million users of its WeChat messenger service. The tech giant, which will report second-quarter results on Wednesday, has wider global rollout plans for the smash-hit game but there are concerns it may not be able to replicate the popularity in some overseas markets.
"Asian markets have better outlook. U.S. and EU would still be a longer-term endeavour. I think culture is a major reason," said Bocom International analyst Connie Gu.
Tencent is expected to launch Honour of Kings, which boasts of some 80 million active daily players, in the United States as early as this year, having released variants of the game under different names in markets including Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, Vietnam and Europe.
"We are conservative for the time being on U.S. revenue in our model. Overseas expansion for Chinese gaming publishers is still difficult, there are few success examples," Gu said.

Tencent, the world's largest gaming company, is expected to report a second-quarter revenue of 52.98 billion yuan ($7.9 billion), up 48 percent from a year ago, according to an average forecast from 10 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.
Smartphone games revenue is likely to surpass that from PC games for the first time and account for nearly 30 percent of the total. Tencent's profit over the quarter is expected to rise 31.8 percent to 14.15 billion yuan.
Tencent is also expected to log big jumps in advertising revenue, driven by social advertising, and mobile payment business on WeChat app's growing user base and China's rapid adoption of the cashless lifestyle.
WeChat, China's most popular messenger app that comes with the mobile payment function WeChat Pay embedded in it, had 938 million users at the end of March.
"We believe Tencent, as the largest mobile ecosystem by traffic in China, has far-reaching monetization potential as incremental ad budget moves to mobile," Jefferies analyst Karen Chan said.

The departure of defender Toto Nsiala has freed up cash for Hartlepool United boss Craig Hignett to bring in at least two loan players.
And the Mail understands that one deal is close to completion - although the new boy, thought to be a loan addition, is not expected to be done until after this afternoon's clash at Accrington Stanley.
One deal is close. It is not signed and sealed but we hope to have one in for Grimsby
Yesterday, Pools confirmed DR Congo international Nsiala's exit to League One Shrewsbury Town.
The club received an undisclosed fee for defender, only signed from Grimsby Town in the summer.
Nsiala is reunited with his old Mariners boss, Paul Hurst, who is the Shrews' current manager.
The 24-year-old made 25 appearances in all competitions for Pools, who are believed to have picked up a five-figure fee for the player.
His last appearance in a blue shirt was an unconvincing one in the 3-2 win over Morecambe on Friday night.
In his time at the Northern Gas & Power Stadium, Nsiala has been far from convincing. For every top class performance from the non-league graduate, there have been a fair share of errors, many of which have cost Pools dear in recent months.
As well as on the pitch performances being regularly below par, behind the scenes his professionalism has also been called into question.
And it is thought the player's departure has been welcomed by many at the club.
While manager Craig Hignett is short on defensive options ahead of this afternoon's trip to the Crown Ground, it is thought that he sanctioned the deal. And it is understood that the gaffer, who has always admitted that players must leave before additions can be made this month, will receive an increased transfer budget in January, due to the exit of former Everton training Nsiala. Although, the wages freed up and cash pocketed in the deal is unlikely to mean Hignett can stretch to any permanent transfers, with loans still likely to be high on the agenda.
Speaking about the window ahead, and about a deal being close to completion, the manager said: “Me and the chairman have had a chat.
“There will be one or two things happening in this window. “We have got people who we like and we can afford then we will probably do it.
“One deal is close. It is not signed and sealed but we hope to have one in for Grimsby.”
Ryan Tunnicliffe is determined to make the most of his opportunity to stake a Millwall starting spot – with Shaun Williams' injury opening the door for midfield rivals.
The Lions suffered a setback this week with the news that the Irish midfielder will be out for the next three months with knee ligament damage.
Tunnicliffe, signed just before the Championship campaign started following his release earlier in the summer by Fulham, replaced Williams for Saturday's 3-1 defeat to Barnsley.
“You never like to see a team-mate go down injured – especially with a bit of a long-term one,” said Tunnicliffe, 24. “I do feel for him, because he has been playing well.
“It is bad for the squad but it is an opportunity for me.
“The proper heads-up that I was starting on Saturday was when the boss named the side. We did a bit of team shape before that, which gave me an idea. I'd also spoken to Willo, so I knew his knee was not too great. That made me think I was in with a shout.
“It was an exciting one for me, my first start at home.
“It's hard to say how I did. We lost 3-1 at home, which isn't great. We've all been away thinking about the game and result in the last few days.
“It's one that sticks in the mind. You think ‘could we have done any better?' For my first start I was alright, but there is a lot to improve on.”
Williams has been one of the standout performers for the Lions in the first two months of the campaign, although his understated style of play does not always attract plaudits.
“I've had that in my career at times with the way that I play,” said Tunnicliffe.
“Running around and doing the dirty stuff for the team. You don't get the same limelight as the guy scoring goals. Willo is a vital cog in what we like to do.
“Hopefully I can fill the void. I've been sitting waiting. I'll be trying my hardest to keep Willo out of the team when he is back fit, if that is something I can do. It's up to me to put in the performances to make the gaffer pick me.
“I knew when I first came here it wasn't going to be easy to force my way into the team. I've played against Willo and Sav [George Saville] a few times and know they are good players. I've stayed professional and patient. This feels like my chance now.”
Millwall go to Brentford next weekend. When Tunnicliffe was on Fulham's books it was a west London derby. It is not long – November 25 to be exact – before he is set to return to Craven Cottage.
“Brentford was a game that was always circled on the calendar,” said Tunnicliffe.
“It was one I looked forward too, because it's my type of game where you need to put a few tackles in.
“I'm sure there are still bragging rights for the fans here if we pick something up.
“Fulham is one that I have circled this year. I spent three years there and still have some good mates at the club. To go back and get a good result would be perfect for me.
“We are solid defensively and don't fear any team. We feel we can turn up, keep clean sheets and nick the odd goal here and there.”
One of the best things about the new year is trip-planning for the 365 days ahead.

WATCH: What are the cheapest places for Canadians to fly?
Here are the 17 places we think are most worth exploring in 2017:
1. Canada
You don't have to trek far to enjoy this world renowned travel destination, which has so much to offer coast-to-coast and is finally getting the props it deserves.
The Lonely Planet, the world's largest travel guide publisher, placed our country at the top of its list of “best destinations” for the coming year.
WATCH: An overview of why Canada is awesome
National Geographic also just listed Banff, a crown jewel of Alberta's Rocky Mountains, as one of the world's top 21 travel spots.
Vogue, meanwhile, called Canada's Prairies “vaguely exotic, totally obscure, and an absolute must-visit destination.”
The magazine focused its praise on Saskatoon, a.k.a. “The Paris of the Prairies,” as well as Winnipeg. The latter is home to the world's first human rights museum and a growing number of foodies (we hear the Deer+Almond is definitely worth checking out if you visit).
Another big reason to explore Canada in 2017: it'll be its 150th birthday, and access to all the national parks will be free.

2. Morocco
This gateway to Africa has been recognized by National Geographic and the New York Times, which named Morocco a top pick for adventurous young travellers.
It's “culturally rich, easy to get around and budget-friendly,” the Times explained.
Lonely Planet agrees, including it in its list of 12 “best value” destinations.
Make sure to check out Casablanca, Fez, Marrakesh, and the coastal town of Essaouria, “where you can eat fresh-off-the-boat seafood” on its piers,” says the Times.
“If time permits, you can even head by camel into the desert.”
A stop in Morocco's all-blue gem, Chefchaouen, is another must-do.
3. Sri Lanka
Two top travel bloggers chose Sri Lanka as their must-see country.
Matt Stabile, of theexpeditioner.com, has noticed the country emerge as a favourite among travellers following years of civil war. For an island so small, he says, the country has so much to offer.
“From the ancient ruins of civilizations past in the cultural triangle in the Central Highlands, to the beautiful beaches and once-in-a-lifetime game encounters in the national parks in the South — there really is something for every type of traveller here.”
The vibrant countryside is also “filled with waterfalls and amazing hikes,” added Matt Kepnes of nomadicmatt.com.
Sri Lanka's other big draws for Kepnes are that the locals are super friendly, the food is delicious, and travel in the country is cheap.
He says you can often find inexpensive flights there through Emirates and Qatar Airlines.
4. Namibia
Kristin Addis of bemytravelmuse.com believes the African country is the ultimate escape.
“If you like to be outdoors, love adrenaline activities, and enjoy the beach, it really is perfect. You can sand board, skydive, and surf all in the same day.
“The contrast of the bright orange sand and the corn blue sky is so unique, and the night stars are so clear and stunning. It really is a special place. Plus, when it's winter in North America, it's warm and summery down there.”
Sweetening the deal is that Lonely Planet chose Namibia as a top pick for value, explaining “Namibia's dollar… has been depreciating in value against many currencies for a few years, making now an opportune time to experience this amazing country.”
5. Bulgaria
If you're looking for something different in Europe, Maria Stoyanova of travellingbuzzblog.com suggests heading east and going off the beaten path.
She chose Bulgaria for its “unspoilt charm, gorgeous mountains and nature, amazing Black Sea coast, authentic culture and architecture and centuries old history.”
Stoyanova recommends checking out “the vibrant capital” Sofia, the bohemic town of Plovdiv, doing a hike in “the beautiful mountains,” as well as making a stop in Nessebar and Sozopol on the Black Sea.

Jeremy Scott Foster of travelfreak.net adds the Balkans in general are “one of the most underrated travel destinations.”
“Places like Serbia, Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, and Bosnia are wildly unique and interesting places, unlike any other part of the world. Not only are the Adriatic coastlines opulent and extraordinary, but it's a budget-friendly location for all travellers.”
For those who want to hit a few spots in the region, G Adventures offers an eight-day Montenegro sailing trip from Dubrovnik, Croatia for $1,599.
6. Slovenia
Two travel bloggers showered Slovenia (home of America's next First Lady) with their praises.
“Gorgeous scenery, historic buildings, off the beaten track, similar to Croatia but much cheaper and less busy,” Tamara Elliott of GlobeGuide.ca said of her choice.
She says the country's compact size makes it easy to explore in just a week. Her standout spots to see include: the emerald Soča River Valley in the Julian Alps; Predjama Castle, which juts out of a cave; and the Postjana Cave system, which is one of the world's most diverse karst cave systems and home to the so-called “human fish.”
The most iconic spot in the country, in Elliott's eyes, is Lake Bled. It's famous “for its steepled church perched on a forested island, surrounded by sparkling blue water.”
And of course who could forget Ljubljana, the capital renowned for its café culture and beautifully-preserved Old Town.
“There's so much to see and do for people of all ages around the city and every day there's a new alternative trend popping up where you'd least expect it. Think cat cafes, bars under bridges and graffiti paradise,” said Melvin Böcher of traveldudes.org.
Among his favourite things to do in the eco-friendly city: stand-up paddling down the river, kayaking, bike tours, food tours, and caving.
7. Norway
Lloyd and Yaya, the guys from handluggageonly.co.uk, are really into Norway, which they believe is “one of the most beautiful, friendly and awe-inspiring destinations in all of Europe.”
“Don't forget to include one of the world's prettiest train journeys on the Flam Line, which literally climbs the dramatic mountains,” they told Global News.
“If you're looking for an authentic Norwegian coastal town, make sure to head to Alesund where you'll be able to explore many of the stunning fjords that are in the beautiful region.”
Christy Woodrow of ordinarytraveler.com adds the Scandinavian country is “an adventure-lover's dream destination.”
“Visiting in the winter provides opportunities to view the stunning Northern Lights,” she said, “Travel during the summer months is perfect for hiking, kayaking and waterfall chasing.”
She offers some tips on how to save money when travelling in Norway on her blog.
8. Finland
This northern European nation will celebrate a century of independence in 2017. So if you've ever wanted to visit, now is the time.
“The Finns will celebrate their centenary with gusto, with events planned in every region. Expect everything from al fresco concerts and communal culinary experiences to sauna evenings and vintage-travel-poster exhibitions,” writes Lonely Planet, which ranked Finland third on its list of top countries.
“There's even a new national park, an 11,000-hectare chunk of land in Hossa, studded with pine forests and crisscrossed with rivers.”
Finland will also play host to the World Figure Skating Championships and the Nordic World Ski Championships in 2017, no doubt helping it land a spot on National Geographic‘s coolest hot spots to check out.
9. Netherlands
If you're a fan of art and design, a trip to the Netherlands might a good fit.
Adam Groffman, from TravelsofAdam.com, has his sights set specifically on Eindhoven in the southern province of Brabant.
“The city is the birthplace of Philips electronics and lighting, and as such, it holds an important place in design history,” Groffman said.
“With the annual Dutch Design Festival each October, the city is one of those places where creativity flourishes — not to mention that the year 2017 marks 100 years since the beginning of the modernist De Stijl art movement. So the Netherlands is planning a lot of great events to promote Dutch design.”
He personally loves the Van Abbe Museum and its contemporary art collection, the Kazerne restaurant and gallery, the new Stadsbrouwerij craft brewery and the “super hip Strijp-S area with its shops, galleries, restaurants and converted lofts — once part of the Philips factory and now converted into a creative and cultural hub.”
10. Iceland
While some travellers might think Iceland has had its moment, a Contiki survey of 5,000 people revealed it is the most desired destination for 18 to 35-year-olds in Canada for 2017.
Everyone apparently wants to bathe in Iceland's famous Blue Lagoon. The balmy, self-cleansing water is filled with silica, algae and minerals that make it “a killer natural skin regime.”
WATCH: Why Iceland is the first pick on everyone's bucket list
Just don't forget to bring a parka.
The country has a cold oceanic climate, with average year-round temperatures hovering around of 0°C.
11. Wales
While the U.K. isn't exactly off the beaten path, few tourists make it past London.
For those keen to capitalize on the British pound, which has plunged more than 18 per cent since the Brexit vote on June 23, Matt Long of LandLopers.com proposes a trip to Wales.
“From budget to luxury, Wales has a lot to offer and it's very much under the radar of the casual tourist,” he said.
“With stunning coastlines and rolling green hills… not only is this a nature lover's dream destination, but there's plenty to do if you love adventure travel, food exploration or cultural immersion.”
Make sure to take a stroll around historic Cardiff. Or if you're an adrenaline junkie, get your blood pumping with some coasteering (i.e. climbing, jumping or swimming) in the Irish Sea.
12. Colombia
Fancy a trip to South America? Cartagena, Colombia is on National Geographic‘s radar.
The country also ranks second on Lonely Planet‘s list, with the guidebook calling the South American country the “ultimate comeback kid.”
“Decades of civil war and violent crime meant Colombian passport stamps were once for hardcore travellers only. Fast forward to the present day, and the lost years seem but a dust speck in Colombia's rear-view mirror,” the guide says.
“The country's mix of vibrant culture, nature and hospitality is a rich tapestry woven by welcoming arms. Over a decade into its dramatic about-face, this South American jewel is even expecting a visit from the world's number-one Catholic.
“When Pope Francis kisses Colombian soil in 2017, it will mark the Andean nation's first papal visit in 30 years.”
13. India
India has much more to offer than the Taj Mahal.
Katie McKnoulty of thetravellinglight.com recently fell in love with the town of Bundi in northern India's Rajasthan province.
“Small enough to navigate with ease yet bursting with abandoned forts, ancient stepwells, and palaces left untouched from the last days of the maharajas, it's a great place to venture slightly off the typical tourist trail,” she told us.
She stayed at the “charming” family-run Bundi Vilas, “beautifully decorated and set in a heritage haveli mansion on top of a hill looking out to Bundi's blue buildings below.”
14. Cambodia
The people in Cambodia have been described as some of the nicest you'll ever meet, and its sights some of the most breathtaking.
Travel interest is sure to be piqued after ancient cities were found hidden beneath the jungles near Angkor Wat this year.
G Adventures offers a nine-day tour of the country from $1,299.
15. Nepal
Nepal — which received a visit from Prince Harry in 2016 — is still rebuilding a year-and-a-half after a colossal earthquake struck the south Asian country.
It lands in the top spot of Lonely Planet‘s list of “travel bargains” for 2017.
“It remains a fabulous choice for budget-conscious travellers, who can access the best of its world-famous trekking routes and underrated wildlife for well south of USD$50 a day,” the travel site writes.
“Visitor numbers are slowly recovering and the time is ripe to get back to Nepal's mighty mountains; wherever you go, you'll receive a warm welcome, as your visit brings much-needed income to communities getting back on their feet.”
16. Bhutan
This small kingdom in South Asia, sandwiched between the foothills of the Himalayas and the Indian Ocean, is all the buzz after hosting a couple high-profile visitors this year: Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton.
The royals would have enjoyed the mountains, which dominate the region, as well as “wonderful forests, hidden treasures like the Buddhist temples and waterways.”
Bhutan has a couple big achievements to be proud of. It's the world's first carbon negative country, as well as the happiest country in all of Asia (based on a global survey by Business Week) and the eighth happiest in the world.
Happiness is actually encoded in law there. In 1729, it was declared that “if the Government cannot create happiness for its people, there is no purpose for the Government to exist.” In 1972, the king declared Gross National Happiness to be more important than Gross National Product.
“The people of Bhutan take this so seriously that they have hand-painted signs throughout the country offering life-affirming mantras, such as ‘Life is a journey! Complete it!' and ‘Let nature be your guide,'” according to the Mirror.
A 10-day Bhutan trip with G Adventures will cost you $3,199.
17. Nevis
Last but not least, Canadians looking to warm up over our long, cold winter might want to consider this tiny Caribbean island.
“Nevis is unspoilt, relaxed, and easy-going,” said Charli Moore of wanderlusters.com
“Wide open spaces and a rich cultural heritage implore visitors to ditch the clichéd holiday itinerary of all-inclusive sea, sand and sun, and instead immerse themselves in the real Caribbean.”
Nevis is the epitome of relaxation, with not even a single traffic light.
The more active sun-seekers could spend a day scaling the 3,232-foot Nevis Peak.
“Perfect for all levels of climbers,” Moore assured. “Those who reach the top will be rewarded with unparalleled views that stretch out across the sea.”

Second chances in a revered competition like MasterChef don't come around often, and after winning the cook-off, Tamara is one of the lucky ones who now has another shot at the 2017 title. And you can bet she's back with a renewed sense of chutzpah. Below, our chat with the 28-year-old on flexing her cooking muscles again, her tight friendship with Eloise and her food earring collection.
POPSUGAR Australia: Congratulations on getting a second shot at the competition! How are you feeling at this point?
Tamara: I have to say, I feel like it's been an absolute rollercoaster ride, but it isn't over yet. And I think the team challenge proved that yesterday. I'm back in elimination again, but that's what the competition is about — it's just heating up now.
PS: Your reaction when you found out it was you was the best. Did you see it coming?
Tamara: I approached that second chance cook with no expectations about getting back into the competition, to be honest. I wanted to cook a really good dish for the judges so I could walk away happy, regardless of the result. When the result was announced, I just couldn't contain my excitement or how I felt at that point in time when I got my apron back.
PS: Do you think getting eliminated and then coming back has made you stronger?
Tamara: I think it's tough to go through elimination, leave the competition and come back, but in some ways, it does make you stronger. Whilst it's not that enjoyable to go through those experiences at the time, reflecting on it, I think it does make you a stronger cook.
PS: You seem like such a positive, upbeat person. Tell us your secret to seeing the bright side of things!
Tamara: [Laughs] I feel the feelings just like everybody else does — I feel the pressure, the stress. But I think my reaction to all of that is just to smile through it, and I feel like if I smile, that things will somehow be better. I definitely have a nervous smile, so not all the smiles are 100 percent happy, but I do think it helps to stay positive through it.
PS: What did you learn from that dessert pressure test?
Tamara: I thought that was my kind of dish to recreate and something that I'd be quite strong at, but I think I put too much pressure on myself to succeed in that challenge. I really should've just trusted my instincts a lot more.
PS: What would you say your biggest strength and weakness is?
Tamara: I think my strength is being a little bit creative and thinking outside the box. In terms of weakness, it's definitely hard to back it up every single day, so it can be quite hard to think of things on the spot. But you just have to take every challenge as it comes, and that's what I try to do.
When you've done well and you end up in an immunity challenge, or done badly and end up in elimination, every single cook in the kitchen gives you experience, but it also means that you cannot falter at any point in time. If you make two mistakes in the MasterChef kitchen, it can send you home, as I've seen already! So you've really got to front up for every single challenge. It can be hard when the smallest thing can send you home, but at the same time it's a good thing that everyone is cooking so well.
PS: I'm loving all your little food earrings. Do you have a collection going on?
Tamara: I definitely have a little jewellery suitcase I always carry around with me in the house. It's full of all sorts of earrings. My friends and family actually send me little pairs of earrings from time to time while I'm in the MasterChef house, and when I wear them, I feel a bit closer to home and their support. I do have a lot of food-related earrings. I've got some Bubble O Bills, some avocados, some doughnuts . . . Sometimes in the MasterChef kitchen, it can be tough to stay upbeat and positive all the time, so I feel like even just having a bit of brightness on my ears can make a difference.
PS: I know you and Eloise are close! What do you think made you guys bond really quickly?
Tamara: It was funny, because I met Eloise straight away at the judges auditions, and we just clicked straight away. I'm not sure if it's because we're both short and outgoing people! [Laughs] We have quite similar personalities, but we were fast friends from the start. She's definitely my BFF. We've already spoken about whether we can do things together after the show — we'd love to continue the friendship and continue the food adventure together.
PS: There's been a few new guest judges this season like Yotam Ottolenghi, as well as favourites like Curtis Stone. Tell us a bit about the whole guest mentor situation – do you guys get much time with them at all?
Tamara: Yeah, it's really great, there are a lot of moments — some of them off camera, where they will come around and give you extra feedback on your dish after a cook has happened. They're all really lovely and more than willing to share their time with us. It's really great because it's what we aspire to do in the food industry — they can see that and they want to help us.
PS: Who's really surprised you?
Tamara: Yotam 100 percent surprised me, because I have to say, I'm not really a salad person, I'm not really a massive fan of having my veggies, but that's what Yotam's all about. Somehow, even for someone like me, he was just incredibly inspirational. He just has this aura about him that makes you love his style of food. He completely blew me away and the rest of the contestants with just how beautiful of a person he is.
PS: Who do you see as our biggest competitors?
Tamara: When I was eliminated and thought at that point, who might go on to win it, I actually think Sam has a great chance. I also joked at the time — Sam Goodwin, Julie Goodwin — it might be the Goodwin name, but I think Sam is an extremely versatile cook. He's really creative as well and I think he'll go far.

An emotional video of a young boy talking about the pain of being bullied has gone viral and many artists including Rihanna, Katy Perry, Snoop Dogg and Cardi B are standing up for him.

“Just out of curiosity, why do they bully?” Keaton Jones, a Tennessee native, asked in the video. “What's the point of it? Why do you find joy in taking innocent people and finding a way to be mean to them? It's not okay.”
He explained that kids make fun of his nose and during lunch they pour milk on him and throw food at him. The video was shot by Jones' mother after she picked him up from school when he told her he was afraid to go to lunch.
After viewing the clip on social media, Katy Perry, Cardi B, Snoop Dogg, Hailee Steinfeld, and others provided words of encouragement to Jones.
“#KeatonJones Hero!!! Thank you young KING for inspiring us all who have been in your shoes at any capacity!” wrote Rihanna on social media. “If you have, or currently are going through any form of bullying, my heart and my prayers go out to you! Bullies…y'all corny!”
“This broke my 💔today. Please be kind to one another,” Katy Perry wrote in a caption for Jones' video.
“Say lil Man U gotta friend in me for life hit me on dm so we can chop it up love is the only way to beat hate,” commented Snoop Dogg.
Zedd and Cole Swindell offered tickets to their concerts while Hailee Steinfeld invited Jones to be her guest at the Pitch Perfect 3 premiere.

North Korea has presented leader Kim Jong-un with plans to launch missiles into waters near Guam and “wring the windpipes of the Yankees.”
But at the same time, both Koreas and the U.S. are signaling their willingness to avert a deepening crisis, with each suggesting a path toward negotiations.
The tentative interest in diplomacy follows unusually combative threats and advances in the North's missile development, but it's unclear whether diplomacy will prevail.
From social media to 24/7 news channels, the constant barrage of information can be both overwhelming and alarming.
In a one-on-one interview with Gov. David Ige, we asked about the concerns posed by North Korea, even if Hawaii is not labeled as a specific threat.
“First and foremost, it really is about preparing our community for what actions we should take should there be an attack,” Ige replied. “We do believe that the threat is very low, but we do believe it's time to update our procedures and have the conversation about what we would actually do in the event there was one.”
While Ige doesn't believe there is any reason for immediate concern, some parents have expressed concern to us. They say they're unsure what to do to calm their children's fears about the threat of a nuclear attack in the Pacific.
The Hawaii Department of Education told us families should refer to the city and state's emergency management services guidelines, and there is no plan now for classroom discussion on any potential attack.
So we turned to family psychologist Dr. Allana Coffee.
“First of all, we tell them that they're not alone, but this is not the first time Hawaii has had to prepare itself or something spooky or scary,” Coffee said.
Whether it be the threat of a natural disaster or something worse, Coffee also cautions that before you go to deep into any conversation with your children, consider their age, their awareness level, and their maturity level.
“I think at about seven or eight or nine is when they really begin to pay attention to social media or looking over our shoulders when we watch the news, so in those cases, if they have questions, we address them as honestly as possible but also simply as possible,” she said. “Now the teenagers, they are seeing this and mining for this information on their own through social media, so we might ask them what they already know and see if we can fill in any pukas that they might have or clarify any misinformation that they might have.”
Coffee says if you have any other questions check you can with the American Red Cross, utilize the services of a family therapist, or speak with kupuna who have been through various types of threats or disasters.

Connecticut's Beardsley Zoo's 10-year-old Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica), Changbai, gave birth on Nov. 25 to four tiger cubs, although only two survived. The two surviving cubs, both females, were removed from Changbai when she showed no interest in taking care of them. Both two-week-old cubs are in seclusion in the Zoo hospital, housed in a 90-degree ambient temperature enclosure, with a base warmed to 85 degrees to sustain the cubs' warmth.
“We are hand feeding the babies five times a day,” explained Zoo Director Gregg Dancho. “They are being given a feline milk replacement formula, supplemented with vitamins. They are a little underweight, possibly due to the age of their mother and the fact that there were four kittens in the litter.” Survival of the two remaining cubs is still a challenge. Zoo veterinarians and animal care staff are doing everything they can to get them through this critical time. It will be several more weeks before the cubs will be available for viewing by the public.
Zoo staff was aware of the tiger's pregnancy through fecal hormone testing, and had been keeping a 24-hour watch on Changbai for the past few weeks. A female tiger at the age of ten has only a twenty percent change of a successful pregnancy, so good husbandry and a quick response from the animal care team makes a difference. When Zoo staff saw the firstborn kitten unresponsive and that Changbai was disinterested in grooming or nursing the remaining kittens, a decision was made to remove them to begin feeding. A second kitten died later that night.
Zoo veterinarians and animal care staff are providing around the clock care and supervision for the remaining cubs. The two kittens' survival is an important step forward in maintaining the genetic diversity of Amur tigers worldwide, a critically endangered species that is rapidly disappearing from the wild. The kittens' survival to two weeks was a critical milestone, but it will be another few weeks before they can be considered out of danger.
Dancho said that every possible effort was being made to help the kittens survive.“The birth of these kittens brings a few more precious tigers to the population, which can help ensure the survival of these majestic animals for future generations.”
Bridgeport Mayor Joseph P. Ganim said, “The news of two tiger cubs born at our own Beardsley Zoo is very exciting. I have to commend the staff at the Zoo for all they do caring for the animals, and most recently, for providing the conditions that led to the miracle of these valuable baby cubs. If you didn't already have enough reason to visit Connecticut's Beardsley Zoo in Bridgeport, now you have two new very cute reasons.”
Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are very rare. According to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' (AZA) statistics, today's tigers are thought to occupy less than seven percent of their original range. Threatened by habitat loss and degradation, poaching, tiger-human conflict, and loss of prey, four of nine subspecies have disappeared from the wild just in the past hundred years. The future of the Amur tiger has been a major concern of the world's zoos for many years.
All tigers now have protected status in the wild, but that doesn't guarantee their safety. A breeding program recommendation comes from the Species Survival Plan (SSP), administered by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums in accredited zoos. Connecticut's Beardsley Zoo is home to the parents, a male, Petya, and a female, Changbai, who joined the Zoo family last winter. Managed by the SSP, inter-regional transfers are arranged with careful attention to gene diversity in the hope that successful breeding will take place. Chang was sent to Connecticut's Beardsley Zoo as an excellent genetic match to the Zoo's resident male tiger.
Connecticut's Beardsley Zoo will provide update on the kittens' condition on its website and on Facebook.
About Amur tigers
The Amur, or Siberian tiger, is a rare subspecies of tiger, and the largest cat in the world. Adult male tigers can weigh up to 675 pounds, with females weighing up to 350 pounds. Chang is small for a female Amur tiger, weighing 297 pounds. Similar to people's fingerprints, no two tigers have the same striped pattern. Amur tigers differ from other tigers with fewer, paler stripes, and a mane that helps to keep them warm. They live in southeast Russia as well as small areas of China and North Korea. They live for 10-15 years in the wild, and up to 22 years in captivity.
About Connecticut's Beardsley Zoo
Connecticut's only zoo, celebrating its 95th anniversary this year, features 300 animals representing primarily North and South American species. Visitors can visit Amur (Siberian) tigers and leopard, Brazilian ocelot, Mexican wolves, and Golden Lion tamarins. Other highlights include the South American rainforest with free-flight aviary, the prairie dog exhibit with “pop-up” viewing areas, the New England Farmyard with goats, cows, pigs, sheep, and other barnyard critters, plus the hoofstock trail featuring bison, pronghorn, deer, and more. Guests can grab a bite at the Peacock Café, eat in the Picnic Grove, and enjoy a ride on the indoor carousel. For more information, visit beardsleyzoo.com.
The city is projecting a $12.1 M dollar shortfall for 2018.
The first quarterly report will be delivered to the finance committee next week.
The report indicates about $4.5 million of the deficit is the result of reduced revenue from photo radar tickets, and higher pension and overtime costs from police staffing Winnipeg Whiteout Street parties.
Another $3.7 million is from debt, benefit and overtime costs within the Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service.
Snow clearing also went above budget by $1.6 million.
Scott Gillingham, finance committee chair, said the first quarter often projects a deficit, which is usually reduced by the end of the year.
“Usually over the last three quarters of the year that deficit is diminished and the financial picture improves,” Gillingham said.
The report will be reviewed at the June 5 meeting.
Seven fire departments in northwest Iowa's Plymouth County are now equipped with pet oxygen mask kits, thanks to the efforts of a Le Mars 7th grader.
Brooklyn Bockelmann raised nearly $1,000 within a month to purchase the kits. She collected much of the money by selling root beer floats at a middle school dance.
“I read a news article about two girls in California who purchased these per oxygen masks for their fire department and I really love animals, so I thought it would be a really cool idea if I did the same thing for our (fire department),” Bockelmann said. Each pet oxygen kit contains three masks of varying sizes.
“The large can be used on large dogs and small horses, the medium can be used on small dogs and cats, and the small can be used on gerbils, hamsters and parrots,” Bockelmann said. This week, Bockelmann delivered the pet oxygen mask kits to the Oyens, Hinton, Kingsley, Merrill, Remsen, Akron and Le Mars fire departments.
Her new goal is to raise enough money for every fire department in Iowa to be equipped with the kits.

Gatlinburg, Tenn. — Sugarlands Distilling Company, distillers of award-winning spirits in East Tennessee, have released Electric Orange Cream Liqueur. The newest Appalachian Sippin' Cream is currently available at the downtown Gatlinburg distillery and will soon be available in stores and online at BuySugarlands.com.
The new spirit combines a bright, fresh orange zest with the smooth taste of vanilla cream. The vibrant orange taste pairs perfectly with the cream to create a taste similar to frozen cream pops found in your hometown malt shop. At 40 proof, electric orange can be sipped straight out of the jar or added to your favorite float.
Electric Orange joins an award-winning line of spirits that has won 20 awards internationally since distillation began in 2014. Sugarlands Distilling Company offers dozens of creative cocktail ideas on their cocktail page.

Troy senior guard Wesley Person took a moment to reflect on the season so far for both himself and the team. (Source: WSFA 12 News)
Troy guard Wesley Person has had a phenomenal season to date.
The senior from Brantley has already broken the Troy all-time scoring and the Sun Belt record for three-pointers made records.
“I didn't expect to have as much success as I've had this early in the season,” said Person. “I knew at the beginning of the season I was close to breaking some records, but I thought it would take all 30 or so games to break it. I think I broke it in maybe 21 or 22 games. It has been a fun experience so far the season.”
For Person, basketball is in his blood.
Both his father, Wes Person Sr., and his uncle, Chuck Person, we're veterans of the NBA and that's when Person's love for basketball began.
“Growing up my dad playing in the NBA and my uncle playing in the NBA, I've always been around basketball,” said Person. “It was easy to catch on to.”
Person has made over 325 three-pointers during his four-year career at Troy.
Person said it took hours and hours of practice to perfect his shot.
“What's comfortable for me is to turn my feet a little bit to the side, have my shoulders lined up with the rim, make sure I have my elbows in and my eyes are focused on the target,” said Person. “That's how I prepare for each shot.”
For those who know Person know that he rarely goes by the name Wes. Person has been called “Tatt” ever since his childhood and it's kind of stuck with him.
“It's a nickname of my grandma gave me,” said Person. "When I got mad, I would say, 'Instead of that,' I would say, 'Tatt.' So my grandma just call me 'Tatt.'"
Record-wise the season has not been kind to the Trojans.
Troy is 9-13 on the season with nine games remaining. Despite getting off to a struggling start, Person isn't ready to hit the panic button just yet.
“We are not panicking yet,” said Person. “You saw what we did last year and we pretty much have a lot of pieces from last year and we know we can go on a run and we have players in place to do so. Our coaches have been keeping that in our heads with what we did last year, but that wasn't our goal of the beginning of the year. Wanted to do well to begin the season, but we still have a team that can go on a run like that.”
Troy will take on rival South Alabama on Saturday at 4:15 p.m. looking to end its two-game skid.

PITTSBURGH – Evgeni Malkin scored and picked up an assist in his return from a lower-body injury, Sidney Crosby got his 999th career point with an assist and the Pittsburgh Penguins rolled by the Vancouver Canucks 4-0 on Tuesday night.
Phil Kessel, Jake Guentzel and Matt Cullen also scored for the Penguins. Matt Murray stopped 29 shots for his third shutout of the season and fourth of his career.
Pittsburgh broke it open with three third-period goals past goalie Ryan Miller. Crosby fed a streaking Guentzel down the slot 2:27 into the third to make it 2-0 and pull Crosby within a point of becoming the 86th player in NHL history to reach 1,000 points.
Miller made 38 saves while under siege for most of the night as the Penguins remained unbeaten in regulation since the All-Star break (5-0-2).
Despite a series of injuries, the defending Stanley Cup champions have managed to keep pace in the supremely tight Metropolitan Division, where the Penguins, Columbus and the New York Rangers are separated by all of two points as they try to keep first-place Washington in striking distance.
Malkin appeared ready to return last Saturday night in Arizona before being made a late scratch by coach Mike Sullivan. Given another couple of days to rest, the Russian star picked up right where he left off before getting injured against St. Louis on Jan. 24. He gave Pittsburgh the lead with his 23rd goal, which was also one of his easiest.
The Penguins were swarming around Miller when Trevor Daley found himself with the puck at the top of the zone. Rather than fire it into a sea of bodies, he slipped a pass to Olli Maatta along the left boards. Maatta skated in and fed Malkin at the far post. Malkin shook off Vancouver's Luca Sbisa and tapped it into the net 5:51 into the second.
The Canucks, nearing the end of their second six-game road trip of the season, appeared to be skating in slush at times. The Penguins controlled play for long stretches but appeared too content to pass it around rather than fire it at Miller.
Vancouver counterpunched effectively, generating most of its opportunities on breakouts rather than any sort of sustained pressure, but Murray was spectacular at times. He snagged Jack Skille's wrist shot on a breakaway out of midair late in the second and stoned Skille on another breakaway early in the third.
By then the Penguins were firmly in control after Crosby set up Guentzel's sixth of the season. Malkin then created a tap-in for Kessel by playing keepaway from two Vancouver defenders and Miller before giving it to Kessel on the doorstep for his 20th of the season.
NOTES: Guentzel is the 110th teammate to factor in a scoring play for Crosby. … The Canucks went 0 for 1 on the power play. The Penguins were 0 for 2 with the man advantage. … Vancouver scratched Cs Brandon Sutter and Bo Horvat and D Philip Larsen. … Pittsburgh scratched D Chad Ruhwedel and C Eric Fehr. … Pittsburgh is 62-0-0 when leading after two periods during Sullivan's tenure.

Troy Tolofson of Melfort entered guilty pleas and was sentenced on charges of impaired driving causing death and resisting arrest on Wednesday, April 18 in Melfort Provincial Court. The charges date back to September 2.
Tolofson, who is 46-years-old, was sentenced to 30 months in prison and also received a three-year driving prohibition and a 10 year firearm prohibition.
Tolofson had originally scheduled his preliminary hearing dates for April 18 and April 19, 2018 in Melfort Provincial Court and instead entered guilty pleas.
He was released on an undertaking on Tuesday, September 12. Crown and Defense consented to the release of Tolofson on an undertaking with numerous conditions.
Tolofson initially appeared in Melfort provincial court on September 5, facing charges of impaired operation of a motor vehicle causing death, impaired operation of a motor vehicle causing bodily harm, two counts of failure to remain at the scene of a collision and one count of resisting arrest.
The charges stem from a collision where a truck traveling east on Highway #789 had collided with a car travelling south on the Kinistino grid.
The driver of the car, 46-year-old Quinn Shermeta of the Melfort area, was pronounced deceased at the scene. The 36-year-old female passenger of the car was transported to hospital in Saskatoon by STARS with unknown injuries.
The lone driver of the truck fled, later identified as Tolofson, fled on foot and was arrested a short distance from the collision scene. He was transported to hospital in Melfort with injuries.
New boy Myles Anderson says he felt an immediate “connection” when he first met Hartlepool United's hierarchy.
And as a result, he had absolutely no doubt Victoria Park was where he wanted to continue his so-far colourful footballing journey.
Anderson started out at Scottish Premiership side Aberdeen as a kid, before moving to then Premier League Blackburn Rovers.
Although he did not make an appearance, Anderson cut his teeth in League Two on loan, before deciding to go for broke and head to the continent, and Italy.
Now back home and in the prime of his career, he's determined to make his mark at Pools, a place where he thinks he's going to fit in perfectly.
“I am extremely excited to be here. I can't wait to get started,” said the 28-year-old defender, who spent three years on the continent playing for SS Monza, Pro Patria, Chievo, L'Aquila and Lupa Castelli Romani.
“I got the call last week to say Matthew had been appointed as manager and he wanted to meet me and talk.
“I came up met with Matthew, Craig Hignettt and Mark Maguire. We had a good conversation, there was some connection and understanding.
“Then I came up to get is sorted as quick as possible.”
Anderson continued: “It goes without saying Craig and Matthew have played at the highest level.
“The manager has an understanding of the game at this level. He understands people, styles of football, we spoke in depth about tactics, football, styles of play and we seem to be on the same wavelength.”
He might have spent plenty of time out of the country, but Anderson knows the National League is no place for a club like Hartlepool.
“When I was growing up I remember seeing Hartlepool in League One and League Two,” he said.
“It has been a difficult period for the club over the last few years.
“Now we are looking to find some stability and work our way back up.
“To be signing for such a big club at this level - I'm delighted.”
Having spent time at the likes of Torquay, Chester and Barrow, as well as having trials at the likes of Carlisle, Anderson knows his way around the lower leagues.
And while he might not have played as many games as he would have liked for his age, he is determined to make up for lost time being proving his worth at the Vic.
He thinks the fans and his fellow pros will appreciate his all-action style.
Anderson said: “They are certainly going to see a very passionate player. A very determined player with a strong mentality.
“I have spoken with the manager about this - I can play in the middle on the left, on the left of a three, at left-back, even at right centre-back.
“I am a team player. Whatever is required of me I will provide that service.
“I am hardworking. Hopefully that will endear me to the fans but also to my colleagues, on the pitch and the coaches, too.
“This is a very exciting project for me. I cannot wait to get going, after a little break which I will use to refresh mentally and physically.”
