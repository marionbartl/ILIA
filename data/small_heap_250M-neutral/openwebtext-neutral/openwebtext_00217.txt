A team from the Haryana health department, during a search of a hospital in the Dera Sacha Sauda, Sirsa, has found that the hospital administration did not follow due legal procedures while conducting medical termination of pregnancy in at least six cases since 2015.
Sirsa DC Prabhjot Singh told The Indian Express that the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act is not being followed properly in Shah Satnam Ji Super Speciality Hospital. “Irregularities have been detected. Further investigations are on”.
The newspaper also reported that in few cases, ultrasound reports were not found. Possibly, there is no proof that the test was conducted before terminating the pregnancy. In one of the cases, the pregnancy was terminated stating that the foetus was not able to survive. But in the same, earlier records in the case file say the foetus was fine.
On Sunday, PTI reported that no proper record of bodies being sent from the hospital running inside the Dera Sacha Sauda headquarters was maintained, while a skin bank was running without license, a senior official said as the mammoth "sanitisation" exercise of the complex was completed.
Secret tunnels, including one which linked jailed sect chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh's plush residence with female disciples' hostel, an empty box of AK-47 cartridges, an illegal firecracker factory were among other shocking detections made, according to Haryana's public relations department deputy director Satish Mehra.
The sanitisation exercise was conducted two weeks after Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh was convicted and jailed by a special CBI court for raping two disciples.
There was large scale violence following the sect head's conviction which left 35 people dead in Panchkula alone. Violence broke out in Sirsa, where six died, and many parts of Punjab as well.

President Obama is reported to be considering an important brake on the torrent of “dark money” already flooding the 2016 presidential campaign — an executive order requiring federal contractors to disclose their donations to political candidates. Mr. Obama should immediately sign such an order. In doing so they would expose some of the bigger players in today's big money politics, while offering a healthy counterpoint to Republican efforts to squelch disclosure.
In votes earlier this month, the House Appropriations Committee's Republican majority quietly inserted an amendment in a spending bill that would block the Securities and Exchange Commission from crafting a rule requiring public companies to open up to their stockholders and voters about their political spending.
Another amendment would stop the Internal Revenue Service from issuing an overdue rule reining in “social welfare” organizations that do not have to disclose donors under current I.R.S. rules and are increasingly misused as big-money conduits for partisan political activity. A third would protect government contractors from disclosing who they're showering with money.
When it blessed unlimited corporate, union and special interest spending in its fatally misguided Citizens United decision five years ago, the Supreme Court expressed hope that public disclosure would deter corruption. Sunlight, said Justice Anthony Kennedy, would let citizens “see whether elected officials are ‘in the pocket' of so-called moneyed interests.”

SEATTLE — Nine firefighters were injured when an apparent natural gas explosion destroyed several buildings in Seattle early Wednesday morning, authorities said.
City officials said Wednesday afternoon that the explosion was accidental, but investigators are still determining where the gas leak occurred.
A gas leak was first reported at 1:04 a.m. Pacific Time. The explosion tore through the city's Greenwood neighborhood, north of downtown Seattle, 39 minutes later.
Firefighters had already responded to the leak when the blast and fire occurred.
The firefighters went to the hospital with minor injuries mostly involving cuts and abrasions. All nine were released by 8 a.m.
It was believed at least three businesses were destroyed and a bike shop was heavily damaged. Several other neighboring buildings had their windows blown out.

"I arrived pretty soon after the massive fire trucks, and at that point, there were tons of flames leaping over what was already the rubble of Neptune Coffee, which as you can see now totaled, gone," said Davey Oil, owner of bike shop G&O Family Cyclery. "We work pretty hard on our business and we really love the neighborhood. Our block is a pretty close-knit block and this is pretty terrible."
Chocolati Cafe manager Darla Weidman said she's relieved it happened overnight instead of 11 a.m. because they sometimes have a packed house.
As the neighborhood hummed to life Wednesday morning, crews were still dousing an active flame with foam. Residents were checking out the damage and the rubble and glass that littered the streets was being swept up. Employees from one cafe damaged in the blast were pouring coffee for firefighters.

Seattle Fire Department spokesperson Corey Orvold said residents of an apartment building and another nearby residential structure were evacuated after the blast.
There was no word of any other injuries or anyone missing, but Orvold said dogs were being used to go through the rubble just in case.

Andy Wappler, a spokesperson for Puget Sound Energy, said the company shut down five of the six control valves that service the area where the explosion happened.
Harborview Medical Center spokesperson Susan Gregg said eight firefighters and a battalion chief were treated at the facility.
They said five were treated and released early Wednesday and four others were in being discharged.
"We didn't have anybody with burns, nothing life-threatening, nothing major," said Gregg, adding that some firefighters were sent to the hospital to be checked out because the blast was so powerful it pushed them back.
Gregg said eight men and one woman were treated.

(KUTV) State Senate candidate Jason Christensen says they overcame suicidal thoughts with the help of God.
That is why they now claim their remarks that called a teen suicide victim a ‘sinner' and a ‘murderer' were out of love for the boy and their family.
RELATED:
“I apologize for my tact,” Christensen said.
Christensen, who is part of the Independent American Party, sympathized with victims of suicide and their families, but did not back down on the content of their comments.
“Taking a life is murder, any way you look at it,” Christensen said.
They slammed what they called the ‘LGBT' agenda during an interview with 2News Friday morning. They said since their comments went viral, they have been the subject of death threats and online hacks -- but has also received messages of support from sympathizers.
“It has been very heart touching as well, to help carry me through this with the fiery darts of the adversary,” Christensen said.
Christensen's comment outraged many people who read it, including Provo business owner Ryan Taylor.
“If he's about families, then support families that have kids who commit suicide,” Taylor said.
Taylor's business had a ‘Christensen for Senate' sign in front of it prior to their learning of the candidate's controversial comments.
“I don't think they have the right to play god, be the judge or the jury in this young man's death,” Taylor said.
Christensen's opponent, incumbent senator Curt Bramble, R-Provo, said the inflammatory comments were inexcusable.
“[Christensen] may be a candidate, but this isn't about politics -- this is about a young man's life, this is about something that transcends any political rhetoric and there is no room for that kind of speech in our society,” Bramble said.
Energy suppliers paid up to €10m last year to wind-farm operators to power down, freedom of information documents supplied to the Sunday Independent reveal.
Energy suppliers paid up to €10m last year to wind-farm operators to power down, freedom of information documents supplied to the Sunday Independent reveal.
The cost of broken or shut-off wind turbines was up to €10m in 2013 and could be passed on to Irish consumers in their electricity bills, communications between EirGrid and the Department of Energy suggest. "The suppliers can, of course, pass this cost on to their consumers," an EirGrid executive said in an email on the subject to a senior civil servant at the Department of Energy.
The amount paid by Bord Gais, ESB and other suppliers for 2013 was up to €10m, according to EirGrid.
However, that cost looks set to soar as the power-down rate of 3 per cent for 2013 is estimated to rise to 10 per cent in 2014, according to EirGrid, suggesting a cost to conventional energy companies of over €30m and a knock-on cost to consumer energy bills. An EirGrid graph on wind curtailments shows them rising 50 per cent further by 2016, which would cost utility companies €40m.
Irish wind-farm operators receive payouts from other electricity providers in respect of "constraints" or "curtailments" where a transmission or distribution line is down for maintenance or where there is a local fault, or when there is high wind at a time of low-energy demand (for example, in the middle of the night) and turbines are shut down due to over-capacity. The same policy is applied internationally.
European energy regulators decided last year that wind farms would receive compensation from the energy market for these shutdowns and it is part of government policy as a way to stimulate the wind energy market.

Move over Koch brothers. Get out of the way Shelly Adelson. There's another billionaire in town, and he's doing all they can to privatize Social Security and Medicare programs.
Say hello to Pete Peterson.
Petersen is a Wall Street billionaire, who,according to The Center for Media and Democracy's SourceWatch.Org, almost exclusively uses their wealth to back numerous organizations and public relations campaigns whose primary goals are to slash government funding to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
According to SourceWatch's PetersonPyramid.org, in 2007, after making a fortune off of the public offering of a Wall Street private equity firm, Peterson pledged to spend a staggering $1 billion of their personal wealth to “fix America's key fiscal-sustainability problems.”
A vast portion of that $1 billion is going to a shadowy astroturf supergroup campaign known as “The Campaign to Fix the Debt”. But don't let the fairly innocuous title fool you.
SPONSORED
As SourceWatch's PetersonPyramid.org points out, in reality, the “Campaign to Fix the Debt” is just the latest effort by Peterson and a bunch of their billionaire friends and corporate cronies to cut away at Social Security and Medicare, all in the name of fixing America's “debt problem”.
While “Fix the Debt” was started in the summer of 2012, before its launch Peterson was already funding organizations like the “Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget” and the “New America Foundation.” As PetersonPyramid.org notes, both of these organizations have the same goals of ultimately privatizing the Social Security and Medicare programs that millions of Americans rely on to survive.
Peterson also gave millions to support the Simpson-Bowles commission according to PetersonPyramid.org, a commission who's proposed “solution” to fixing our debt includes massive austerity-type cuts to this nation's social-safety-net programs. In fact, Erskine Bowles is a co-founder of the “Fix The Debt” program Peterson is funding, so it's no surprise that the recent Simpson-Bowles Catfood Commission 2.0 plan included even more devastating cuts to Social Security and Medicaid.
Much like the many tentacles of the Kochtopus, “Fix the Debt” is more than just one campaign. As SourceWatch's PetersonPyramid,org brilliantly points out, “Fix the Debt” is like a well-organized machine, made up of PR firms, corporate CEO's, partner organizations, and so-called “state chapters.” Progressives argue that if the so-called “Fix the Debt” goals are reached, it will worsen the gap between the wealthy elite in America and everyone else.
But here's the real kicker. Peterson and their “Fix the Debt” campaign have made it into the halls of The White House.
Many of the CEO's involved with the “Fix the Debt” campaign are the heads of some of America's largest corporations, and many have testified on Capitol Hill and met with President Obama directly during discussions on the economy and the national debt.
And then there are the corporations themselves that are involved in the campaign. The list of backers is a virtual Who's Who of corporate greed and corruption, including big banks like Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.
Besides defunding Social Security and Medicare, PetersonPyramid.org shows how “Fix the Debt” may also be a front for exploiting a corporate tax loophole to its fullest potential. Many of the corporations involved with “Fix the Debt” pay a negative tax rate – instead of paying taxes, they get government money back – which is a major reason why we have such a large federal deficit right now.
These corporations are pushing for a “globally competitive” tax structure that Citizens for Tax Justice says would increase the US debt by $1 trillion over the next decade, and would also encourage the offshoring of U.S jobs. While exploiting a corporate tax loophole isn't a direct goal of “Fix the Debt,” the proposed “globally competitive” tax structure would bring in $134 billion for at least 63 corporations involved with “Fix the Debt,” according to a report by the Institute for Policy Studies.
And, of course, if Social Security is privatized, guess who takes over? Wall Street takes over. The same Wall Street where Peterson made their money, and where their buddies are salivating over the $2.7 trillion Social Security trust fund.
So what's the bottom line to all of this?
Pete Peterson and their strong efforts to privatize Social Security and Medicare are working. Average Americans have no idea that Social Security is just fine, and has a $2.7 trillion surplus. Instead, in part because of all the PR and advertising and hired talking heads from Peterson's various front groups, Americans – particularly young Americans – are more likely than not to doubt Social Security will survive as long as they will.
This perception that the social safety net in this country is failing is helping turn America into a feudalistic state. Like in Dickens' 19th Century England, the wealthy elite increasingly control everything, and the working class is forced to live off of billionaire scraps.
Every day that the “Fix the Debt” and other Pete Peterson efforts succeed at destroying Americans' faith in our own government, We The People lose.

By the close of the business day on Friday, the political story on the nation's front burner was a surprising decline in African-American turnout. According to early vote totals in some key swing states, Hillary Clinton was going to fail to reassemble a core element of Barack Obama's winning coalition of voters. With Donald Trump's enthusiasm surging and Republicans finally “coming home” behind their unconventional nominee, Clinton's allies were sounding the alarms. Then, on Friday night, a funny thing happened. The sleeping giant that is the nation's registered but often-unenthusiastic Latino vote awoke.
An unexpected surge in the Latino vote was most vividly illustrated in Nevada's Clark County. By 8 p.m. on Friday, over 50,000 people had voted. With in-person polling places mobbed, the state extended voting hours to 10 p.m. The scenes at a polling place in a Las Vegas Cardenas Market were especially remarkable. By the end of the night, over 57,000 people had voted. These were not Republicans. On Friday alone, nearly 30,000 Democrats had cast early ballots in Clark County compared to just over 15,400 Republicans.
The news for the GOP wasn't any better in Florida. From the Republican perspective, polls of the Sunshine State's Latino voters were already dismal. A bipartisan survey conducted for Univision found Trump trailing Clinton by a dramatic 30-point margin. Even among historically GOP-voting Cuban-Americans, Trump enjoyed only the support of a modest plurality.
When the early votes started rolling in, the participation among Florida's Hispanic voters shocked those who had modeled the state's electorate. On Thursday alone, wrote Florida-based political strategist Steve Schale, “82.5 percent of Hispanic early voters were considered low propensity voters.” At least 200,000 more Hispanics had voted on Friday than at the same point four years prior. “Florida electorate poised to be more diverse than our poll, or most of our September panelists,” observed the New York Times' Nate Cohn, who helped conduct a Times/Siena College survey of the state. As of Sunday, 32 percent of Hispanic early voters had not voted at all in 2012.
That is, in short, the sum of all Republican fears. The GOP had long known that the nation's Hispanic voters did not participate in elections at rates commensurate with their registration levels, but it would be a nightmare for the Republican Party if they ever did. In 2012, Latino participation declined despite Democratic efforts to transform Mitt “self-deportation” Romney into a monster. All it took to turn this potential political force into a kinetic one was a Republican presidential nominee who equated Mexican migrants with rapists, insisted a judge of Mexican-heritage could not be objective, and made radical mass deportations the centerpiece of their campaign for the presidency. Who could have guessed it?
This was always the flaw in the theory that Republican could win a presidential popular vote by doubling down on their party's appeal to white voters. Donald Trump ran a campaign of irredentist populism. They promised to turn the clock back on the industrial age and inflamed demographic anxieties among whites in formerly tight-knit, monochromatic communities. The result of this approach has been a surge in enthusiasm for Trump among non-college educated whites. It also appears to have had an equal and opposite reaction in the form of an enlivened base of previously apathetic Hispanic voters.
The true fear for Republicans is that 2016 becomes a realignment election for these Hispanic voters in a way that 1964 was for African-Americans. The black vote, once a solidly Republican constituency, had been drifting toward Democrats for decades preceding the 1964 election. It was, however, black voters' antipathy toward Barry Goldwater that made that year at a turning point. A generation of Latinos, too, could look back on 2016 as the moment in which their political orientation was cast in cement.
When asked in October if a surging Hispanic vote may be enough to push Clinton across the finish line before Trump, former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer snidely dismissed the possibility. “Nah,” they insisted. “They don't get out and vote. They don't vote.” Brewer was whistling past the Republicans' graveyard. The Latino apocalypse the GOP had known was coming for over a decade could be upon them. If so, it may take a generation before the Republican Party can recover.
McConnell criticizes act passed by the House of Representatives earlier this month and says ‘terrorist tactics and the nature of the threat has changed'
The Senate remained at an impasse on Thursday on how to proceed with changes to the NSA's surveillance capabilities, as Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, continued to voice their opposition to reforms.
In a speech on the Senate floor, McConnell criticized the USA Freedom Act passed by the House of Representatives earlier this month – a bill that if also passed by the Senate would end the bulk collection of phone records by the agency.
Edward Snowden: NSA reform in the US is only the beginning Read more
“We need to recognize that terrorist tactics and the nature of the threat have changed,” McConnell said. “At a moment of elevated threat, it would be a mistake to take from our intelligence community any – any – of the valuable tools needed to build a complete picture of terrorist networks and their plans, such as the bulk data collection program.”
The issue is urgent because a key provision of the Patriot Act, the piece of the law that enables the NSA to sweep millions of Americans' phone records without a warrant, is due to expire on 1 June. The Senate is due to go into recess this weekend until that date, so the issue needs to be resolved before they go or this provision will temporarily lapse. If they do not come to an agreement on the issue on Friday, they may be forced to stay in DC on Saturday and do so.
McConnell has been pushing for a two-month renewal of the Patriot Act in its current form, while Richard Burr, the intelligence committee chairperson, has been working on another compromise that would establish a two-year transition period before the bulk collection ends.
Under the USA Freedom Act passed by the House, that transition period is only six months.
Republican leaders have said the USA Freedom bill would not have the 60 votes it needs to clear the Senate, but they also suggested on Thursday that a two-month renewal to the Patriot Act's key provision would lack enough support to pass.
The Senate will hold two procedural votes – one on the USA Freedom Act and another on the short-term extension to the Patriot Act provision – after lawmakers complete work on a bill supporting the “fast-track” authority that Barack Obama says they need to complete a 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal.
By Friday afternoon, timing remained uncertain.
The lack of agreement on both trade and the Patriot Act all but guarantee that the Senate will work through Saturday absent any breakthrough.
The White House slammed Senate leaders on Friday for stalling on the USA Freedom Act in perhaps the Obama administration's strongest words yet on the issue.
Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said the House bill was a compromise proposal “that was painstakingly crafted with significant input from the intelligence community”.
“After thousands of hours of meetings and painstaking work on what everyone would acknowledge is a complicated policy issue, a reasonable bipartisan compromise emerged,” Earnest told reporters at their daily press briefing. “We've spent a lot of time talking before about how difficult this Congress in particular has found it to be to do even simple things … this policy proposal is extraordinarily complicated and one that has significant consequences for the national security in this country and the basic civil liberties of the American people.
“The point is, the hard work on this has been done,” they added, while warning about the possible lapse in the Patriot Act on 1 June. “There is no plan B.”
Earnest declined to say if Barack Obama would sign a short-term extension of the Patriot Act, pointing out that it was unclear if there were sufficient votes in the Senate for such a measure to pass.
VLADIMIR Putin was defeated by the weather today, despite spending £1.3 million to spike the clouds with a chemical cocktail to supposedly guarantee sunshine on their vast annual military parade.
A 72-aircraft Red Square fly-past was grounded because of low cloud over the Kremlin, thwarting their bid to showcase their air force and honour Russian pilots who have served in Syria.

The Soviet "weather changing" technology successfully prevented rain on Putin's parade but failed to disperse the thick low cloud so only a display of armoured vehicles and missile systems went ahead.
Earlier one of their military commanders had vowed the monster parade of Russia's firepower would lead the countries enemies to "salivate".
Putin told the annual 9 May commemoration of the end of the Second World War in Europe in the presence of many veterans: "We will always guard Russia just as you, the soldiers of the Victory, did. And [we will] strengthen the traditions of patriotism, loyally serving the homeland.

"The lessons of the past war force us to be vigilant and the Russian Armed Forces are ready to repel any potential attack."
They vowed: "There was no, there is no and there will be no force that could ever enslave our people.
"They fought to the bitter end, defending their homeland, and did what seemed impossible, they turned the bloody wheel of the Second World War back, drove the enemy from our land where it dared to come, crushed Nazism, put an end to its atrocities.
"And we will never forget that it was our fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers who brought the freedom to Europe and the long-awaited peace on the planet."
WHAT IS PUTIN'S GOD-LIKE WEATHER CONTROL SYSTEM? Vladimir Putin has a method of weather control known as cloud seeding which is commonly used at airports around the world. The process requires silver iodide, potassium iodide and dry ice to be pumped into the atmosphere to freeze and enlarge the water droplets contained in incoming clouds. This ensures the droplets grow in size, fall out of the sky and disperse the clouds before they reach the area in question.

Their emotional speech came on the most sacred day in the Russian calendar - known as Victory Day - when people commemorate the 27 million soldiers and civilians who lost their lives between 1941 and 1945.
The Russian president personally took the salute at the parade involving 10,001 troops and 114 units of military equipment. But a fly-past of 72 aircraft was cancelled.
This mean no display by Russia's Sukhoi Su-30SM fighter jets, which have seen combat action recently in Syria.
On display in Moscow was the the newly developed Tor-M2DT short-range anti-aircraft missile system and the Pantsir-SA surface-to-air missile system, both designed to operate in the Arctic.
Thundering across the Red Square cobbles was the T-72B3M variant of the T-72 main battle tank.

Ahead of the parade, air force Commander Col. Gen. Viktor Bondarev had vowed: "What makes this year so special is that virtually each and every pilot who will take part in the 9 May flyby in Moscow has fought in Syria, is highly decorated, and will showcase skills that will make many countries salivate."
The aim was to put on display "our very best achievements, all the good things we have," they said. Their hopes were defeated by the weather.
Many Russians were today honouring the dead in their own families by taking part in marches to the Immortal Regiment, holding pictures of relatives who perished in the war.

This is Russia. This is "not Russia".
That's the message the Canadian Nato delegation tweeted, in map form, to Russian soldiers "who keep getting lost and 'accidentally' entering Ukraine".
"Geography can be tough," it notes snarkily.
On Tuesday Ukraine released video of Russian paratroopers it says it captured within its eastern border. In response, Russian military sources said the men had crossed an unmarked portion of the border "by accident".
Canadian officials, it seems, aren't buying the story. Since the tweet went live, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has alleged that Russian troops have been "deployed" in eastern Ukraine
The map, which was sent out on Wednesday morning, has been retweeted more than 16,000 times. Users took to social media to offer their own commentary on geographically misguided Russians and Canadian "cheekiness".

"This is probably the most aggressive Canadian act since like 1812," tweets Kelsey D Atherton.
Of course, Americans could also probably use a little remedial geography instruction, if a poll conducted by the Washington Post in April is any indication.

Only 16% of respondents correctly located Ukraine on a map, and more than a hundred of the 2,066 participants seemed to think the Eastern European country was somewhere near Greenland or, ironically enough, Canada.
As the Toronto Globe and Mail reports, the tweet - which notably includes the contested Crimean region as part of "not Russia" - isn't an isolated instance of Canadian criticism of alleged Russian incursions into Ukraine.

"Russia's acts of aggression and intimidation toward Ukraine call for collective action," said Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird on Tuesday. "Canada, together with its like-minded allies, must clearly speak out."
An illustration did not accompany that statement.
UPDATE: A little more than 24 hours after the Canadian Nato delegation sent out its now-viral map, the Russian Nato delegation returned fire with a tweet from its official account.
"Helping our Canadian colleagues to catch up with contemporary geography of #Europe," was the message attached to a map of the area around the Black Sea.
Most notably, the Crimean Peninsula is labelled "Russia" and Abkhazia and South Ossetia - which have declared their independence from Georgia but have not been internationally recognised - are shaded.
Russia and Georgia fought a battle in 2008 over the territories, which still contain Russian forces.
Conveniently left unillustrated is the portion of Eastern Ukraine that is currently home to most of the fighting between Ukrainian forces and separatist rebels, where Ukraine says the Russian paratroopers were captured.
We anxiously await a Russian-produced map of Canada that shows an independent Quebec. It seems to be the way diplomacy is being conducted these days.

Bobby Lynn Box - Jefferson County jail
Saying they picked a bad time to make threats against a medical facility, police in Alabama arrested a man who threatened to kill everyone who worked in their doctor's office on Thursday as panicky staffers locked the door and called 911.
Bobby Lynn Box, a 44-year-old man from Helena is being held on $200,000 bond after being charged with two counts of making terrorist threats against the staff prior to showing up and demanding their medical records, AL.com reports.
“With all that is going on in our country, they could not have picked a worse time to pull such a stupid stunt,” said Jefferson County sheriff's Chief Deputy Randy Christian.
According to authorities, the doctor banished Box from their practice on Tuesday after they threatened to kill the staffers.
On Wednesday, Box called the office and left a message demanding their medical records, warning the staff that they needed to call them back while reminding them of the threat they had made.
According to Christian, staffers explained to them that they didn't have their records in the office.
Thursday, Box walked into the office and demanded their records while standing at the counter with their hands behind their back. Fearing for their lives, staffers locked the entry door to the treatment area and retreated to the rear of the building where they called 911.
Police responding to the emergency call found Box still standing at the front counter where they were taken into custody.
Box's arrest comes on the heels of the San Bernardino shooting that claimed 14 lives, and a shoot-out at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood office where three- including a police officer — were shot and killed.
“He is extremely lucky they didn't get themselves killed,” Christian explained. “I hope they aren't in their right mind. If they are in their right mind, we will put them in the mix for the ‘I'm just an idiot' trophy.”
Harish Salve had led the battery of lawyers to structure India's case in the UN court
We are grateful to Mr.Harish Salve for presenting India's case so effectively before ICJ. Sushma Swaraj (@SushmaSwaraj) May 18, 2017
Former Attorney General Harish Salve, who famously charged only Re 1 to argue India's case on Kulbhushan Jadhav in the International Court of Justice in The Hague, today said they have done no more than what any Indian citizen would do."For me, this is not a commercial case... It was a public duty. Any citizen of India would have done that... it was of no great moment," said Mr Salve, who was feted on Thursday as the court gave a preliminary verdict in India's favour. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the lead in lauding Mr Salve, who had represented India earlier in international forums as well. In a conversation with External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, PM Modi thanked Mr Salve.Ms Swaraj too praised Mr Salve's efforts. One of their several posts on Twitter following the International Court's verdict read:
Earlier this week, Ms Swaraj had defended Mr Salve on Twitter as someone took a jibe at him. Mr Salve is one of the most expensive lawyers in the country. But Ms Swaraj had pointed out that for this case, they were taking a fee of only 1 rupee.
"I thought Sushma-ji was angry with someone so they tweeted it," Mr Salve told NDTV.
They also related how Ms Swaraj had led the operation "from the front". The foreign minister, they said, had called them in April after they had suggested that India consider the option of approaching the International Court of Justice in an interview with NDTV. The minister, they said, was "personally looking at every step" and the planning was done in complete secrecy which gave India an edge.
Awards season kicks off in earnest at the specialty box office as 'Battle of the Sexes,' 'Stronger' and 'Victoria and Abdul' open in select cinemas.
Matthew Vaughn's Kingsman: The Golden Circle should have no trouble dethroning horror sensation It in its box-office debut this weekend, or lording over fellow new entry The Lego Ninjago Movie.
Tracking suggests the cheeky action-comedy from 20th Century Fox will debut in the $40 million-$45 million range, ahead of the $36.2 million domestic bow of Kingsman: The Secret Service in February 2015. A sleeper hit, the first Kingsman went on to earn $414.4 million globally.
Kingsman 2 reteams director Vaughn with Taron Egerton and Colin Firth. Newcomers include Channing Tatum, Halle Berry, Pedro Pascal and Jeff Bridges. The story follows the Kingsmen as they head to Kentucky after their U.K. headquarters is destroyed. They must seek help from some U.S. counterparts (the Statesmen), who also have a still-alive Harry (Firth).
The sequel, which currently sports a 59 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, will also make a major push overseas.
Warner Bros. Animation's Ninjago, a spinoff of The Lego Movie, is tracking to open in the $30 million range. There's plenty of room for upside since it is the first family offering of fall.
Ninjago is based on the toy line of the same name, one of the brand's most popular with young boys. It is considered a smaller property than either The Lego Batman Movie, which debuted to $53 million earlier this year, or The Lego Movie (2014), which opened to an even bigger $69.1 million.
Ninjago is hoping for a second-place finish, but no one is counting out It, which enters its third weekend.
On Thursday, New Line Cinema and Warner Bros.' film adaptation of Stephen King's novel will pass 1973's The Exorcist ($233 million, counting the 2000 reissue) to become the top-grossing horror film of all time domestically — that is, unadjusted for inflation. When accounting for inflation, the lifetime gross for The Exorcist is a massive $917.5 million.
Nor does It's milestone take into account such hybrid films as The Sixth Sense (1999) or Jaws (1975). Some classify both of those films as horror-thrillers, but opinion is divided. Either way, It is a huge win for New Line — also the home of recent horror hit Annabelle: Creation, which has earned north of $100 million domestically — as well as having scared the box office back to life after a miserable August and tough summer.
Additionally, awards season kicks off in earnest at the specialty box office this weekend as Battle of the Sexes (Fox Searchlight), Stronger (Roadside Attractions) and Victoria and Abdul (Focus Features) open in select theaters following a tour of the fall festival circuit.

UPDATE (10:24pm): This story has been updated to include more information about the previous charges against the accused.
NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ—Authorities announced this afternoon that a suspect who was already in custody has been charged with the murder of William McCaw, a college student found dead in a Hartwell Street backyard more than a month ago.
City resident Timothy Puskas, age 38, was being held at the Middlesex County jail on an unrelated matter, according to a press release from the county prosecutor's office.
On Thursday, authorities kicked down the doors at 64 Plum Street, a home that Puskas owned and lived in. According to sources, they left town just a few days before the raid.
Puskas was arrested and charged in Milltown the following day in the unrelated case and today was charged with McCaw's killing. According to the Star-Ledger's Sue Epstein, jail officials said Puskas was originally charged in a recent aggravated assault incident in New Brunswick and held on $150,000 bail.
This weekend, the front door to 64 Plum Street was left wide open, unable to be closed after the police kicked it down. A toolbox sat in the foyer of the two-family home.
All of the building's tenants, who rented from Puskas, appear to have left for good after the raid.
Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Bradley J. Ferencz set bail today for Puskas at $5 million on the murder charge.
“There have been many dedicated individuals who have worked tirelessly and diligently to solve this brutal crime," said Acting Prosecutor Andrew Carey, who credited dedicated law enforcment officers from the Prosecutor's Offices in Middlesex and Union Counties, as well as the New Brunswick, Rutgers, and Woodbridge police departments.
“I hope that the family and friends of William McCaw have at least some sense of relief knowing that the murderer has been charged and is behind bars," said Carey
The case began when residents of 28 Hartwell Street discovered McCaw's body in their snowy backyard on February 15.
McCaw previously attended Rutgers University and had recently transferred to Kean University. They lived with friends in New Brunswick six nights a week and with their grandfather in Flemington.
McCaw had no known connection to the residents of the property where their body was discovered and a source who wished to remain confidential say they believed that the crime may have been a case of random violence.
According to the source, Puskas sufferred from mental health and addiction issues, as well as a short fuse and violent tendencies.
In 2012, Puskas was charged in another killing: They allegedly ran over a cyclist with a sport utility vehicle near Georges Road.
Puskas was held and eventually freed on $100,000 bail and charged with leaving the scene of an accident.  They are scheduled to face charges of aggrivated manslaughter in that case this June, according to the Star-Ledger.
Anyone with information is asked to call Detective Martinez of the New Brunswick Police Department at (732) 745-5217, extension 6028, or Investigator Daniewicz of the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office at (732) 745-4018.

At a monthly meeting sponsored by the Heritage Foundation, conservative members of congress vented their spleen about the Ryan-Murray budget deal. Though the distaste wasn't universal — Representative Vicky Hartzler (R., Mo.) said they would support it — it was certainly intense. Representatives Jim Jordan (R., Ohio) and Raul Labrador (R., Idaho) bashed the deal for breaking the agreement made early this year in Williamsburg: that Republicans wouldn't get rid of the sequester without long-term budget reform.

“I haven't decided whether I'm going to be a really strong no or just a no,” Labrador told a group of reporters. “I think it's a terrible plan.”
And Representatives Mick Mulvaney (R., S.C.) said the deal wasn't meant to appeal to congressional conservatives.
“This bill is not designed to get our vote,” they said. “This bill is designed to pass with bipartisan support in the House.”
They added that while more than half of the House Republicans will probably support it, it won't win plaudits from many members of the caucus's conservative flank.
This was a book I had planned on NOT reading. I had seen it mentioned in a few places, and saw Jurek promoting it on Twitter and on various blogs, but I just didn't have much interest. While I consider myself an ultrarunner, I'm in a much different place with diet than Scott. Or so I thought… (More on that below…) But then I saw a couple of good comments on it here and there, grabbed the Kindle sample, and was immediately hooked. There's something about reading race reports that I've always been drawn to, and while this was much more than just race reports, there was enough excitement in their recaps of Badwater, Western States, etc., that I was sold.
Regarding diet, I am certainly in a much different place… Jurek has been a vegan for a long time, while I'm much more in the Paleo/Primal world these days, though I wouldn't quite put myself fully in that camp. I suppose if I had to identify myself, it would be similar to the diet outlined in Mark Sisson's The Primal Blueprint (paleo + some dairy w/ the 80% rule (eat this way 80% of the time)) and I also really like the Paul Jaminet's The Perfect Health Diet. But then again I mix in some SCD/GAPS/Weston A Price concepts as well, which Chris Kresser is high on. But certainly not vegan! However, as far as vegan diets go, I think Jurek has it right… While they eat many things I probably would not be interested in, some of the foods I see as problematic they treat the way our ancestors did — soaking and sprouting grains and beans is just one example.
I seek out traditional whole foods rather than highly refined meat substitutes. I look for products that have been sprouted, soaked, or fermented to help break down the indigestible cellulose in plant cell walls. Among soy sources, I favor tempeh, miso, and sprouted tofu, which are all more digestible and have less phytoestrogen (a naturally occurring substance that some—in spite of medical evidence to the contrary—suspect might mimic estrogen's effects in humans) than isolated soy protein. I eat sprouted-grain breads and tortillas, and at home I often soak my whole grains and beans before cooking. My biggest challenge in plant-based eating isn't taking in enough protein but taking in enough calories to replace those I burn on my training runs. I make a big effort to include enough calorie-dense foods in my diet—nuts and nut butters, seeds, avocados, starchy root vegetables, coconut milk, and oils such as olive oil, coconut oil, flaxseed oil, and sesame oil.
If they just added a little meat, I'd be on board. 🙂 A meat eating vegetarian is probably the best way to eat, and by that I mean just eliminate all the processed carbs and refined foods… Fruit, veggies, and well sourced meat seems to be what works best. Jurek even mentions this in a few places, though they ddo't quite go that far. They ttalkabout the problems with industrial farming of animals and how it was different for their grandparents… But they never explicitly says they would eat that way now. Overall he's the least “in-your-face” vegan I've ever read…
But it was really the racing part of the book that I loved. Jurek is an incredible runner, and had some amazing runs and amazing comebacks, when they seemed at the brink of disaster… Only to get up, get moving, and eventually win. And sometimes win really big! Amazing….
One thing that scares me is that UTMB defeated them twice, though they eventually finished — in 18th place. I'd have to put UTMB at the top of the races I dream about running some day… Maybe even above Leadville.
Some quotes… including some that I will use as mantra's on some future run:
We might not have been as experienced as the other teams, and we definitely weren't as well equipped, but we were focused. Coach had only three commandments: Be in shape. Work hard. Have fun. They were the perfect fundamentals for a bunch of poor redneck Minnesotans. Their motto was, “Pain only hurts.” According to bushido, the best mind for the battlefield—or the race—is that of emptiness, or an empty mind. This doesn't mean sleepiness or inattention; the bushido concept of emptiness is more like that rush of surprise and expansiveness you get under an ice-cold waterfall. The empty mind is a dominant mind. It can draw other minds into its rhythm, the way a vacuum sucks up dirt or the way the person on the bottom of a seesaw controls the person on the top. When I hear a runner say they “runs their own race,” what I hear is bushido. Bushido is letting go of the past and the future and focusing on the moment. As Thoreau, an American practitioner (though they probably didn't realize it) of bushido and a pretty good distance walker himself, wrote, “Our life is frittered away by detail. An honest man has hardly needed to count more than their ten fingers . . . simplicity, simplicity, simplicity.” I created my own bushido exercises. I stood in icy rivers to strengthen my mind's control over my body. I sat cross-legged and meditated, visualizing my breath, focusing. And yet ultrarunners—even the fiercest competitors—grow to love each other because we all love the same exercise in self-sacrifice and pursuit of transcendence. Because that's what we're all chasing—that “zone” where we are performing at the peak of our abilities. That instant when we think we can't go on but do go on. We all know the way that moment feels, how rarely it occurs, and the pain we have to endure to grab it back again. The longer an ultrarunner competes, I believe, the more they grow to love not only the sport, not only their fellow ultrarunners, but people in general. We all struggle to find meaning in a sometimes painful world. Ultrarunners do it in a very distilled version.
I've got a bunch of other quotes in my Evernote notebook, but that is good for now. Enjoy!

PRX, the first ICO on Ripple's RCL
THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL ICO. THIS IS NOT LIKE OTHER ICOS WITH A COMPANY BEHIND IT. READ THE FULL POST BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO PARTICIPATE.
TOKENS WERE ISSUED UNDER A NEW ADDRESS AT rPRXcb4T8r7VezKkgRbQBuzGrftsjgJcUu YOU MUST REISSUE TRUST TO THAT ADDRESS TO RECEIVE YOUR TOKENS.
Participate in the experiment! I am selling 1 billion PRX tokens. I created these while creating an article I posted recently.
These tokens are capped. No more PRX tokens will ever exist. They live on the Ripple Consensus Ledger.
As of yesterday, no one controls them.
They aren't a currency, they aren't backed by anything, they don't represent a share in a company, there is no development to be done on them, there will be no development done for them, there is nothing behind PRX except for hopefully a community that might decide to use them. I created these tokens mainly to see if I could do so. Now I am offering them in a token sale to see what the process of running one is like.
This is not an investment this is literally just a token on the RCL. This is a piece of property being sold. If you decide to participate you are doing so of your own free will.
Some quick questions/answers:
Why are you doing this?
Just to experiment with the technology and see how difficult it is to run a token sale. I've already faced a lot of questions just trying to run this little experiment.
How much do you think this sale will raise?
Probably enough to buy me a beer or two.
Will any exchanges list PRX?
Probably not. Which also means it'll probably be pretty worthless, but a neat collector's item.
Why would anyone participate?
This is the first ICO on the Ripple Consensus Ledger. Ethereum has exploded due to all the ICOs operating on their platform. Ethereum used to be about smart contracts but now (especially seeing as few meaningful smart contracts have been developed) it is mainly used for tokens and ICOs.
Imagine if more companies decided to do ICOs on Ripple's Consensus Ledger. I'm opening that door, I'd love to do an actual ICO that represented a real product or was part of a company, but due to living in the U.S. I don't wish to open myself up to the risk of operating a company with an ICO and accepting investment. This is my contribution to the space, I'm providing the real experience of selling a token IOU on the RCL and giving tutorials on how to purchase them, set them up, and operate a sale.
Plus, I officially license whatever company that issues their ICO on RCL to claim to be the first 'real' ICO.
This ICO can prove the concept for whatever companies come next and want to use Ripple's ledger. There are rumors of a PoW token on the RCL being developed, and another digital currency group is exploring the concept.
ICOs should operate on the RCL, with the ability to handle 1000's of txns per second the issues Ethereum has been having handling all the payments wouldn't be so prevalent.

If the sale generates a considerable amount of funds a KYC program may be needed to complete the ICO legally. At which point there may be delays in any PRX payout.
Terms updated June 28th 2017.
Edit June 29th: I will not be participating in the auction at all. I will not put in a bid for any of the PRX tokens. I think I am legally barred from doing so in the U.S. under auctioneering laws.
Additionally I added another disclaimer at the top of the article: "THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL ICO. THIS IS NOT LIKE OTHER ICOS WITH A COMPANY BEHIND IT. READ THE FULL POST BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO PARTICIPATE."
A Progressive Universal Basic Income
by Sandhya Anantharaman
Economic Security Project Blocked Unblock Follow Sep 12, 2017
We have an immense amount of wealth in the United States. Our GDP has grown by $4 trillion over the last 15 years. We have enough homes to house everyone and enough food to feed everyone. We have an abundance of resources at our disposal — and yet our political thinking remains mired in an austerity mindset.
Those of us who support universal basic income generally recognize that status quo thinking is one of our biggest obstacles. If your point of view is locked into today's political perspectives, and you see incremental policy adjustments as the only path forward, something as radical as basic income seems hopelessly pie in the sky. But even basic income supporters often maintain today's austerity mindset when designing policy, compromising and contorting their implementation to fit inside a particular fiscal box.
We instead approach basic income from the perspective of abundance and aim to accomplish two core goals: establishing a minimum standard of living as a fundamental human right for all people; and ensuring no one is left worse off by the policy. To that end, we imagine an uncompromised and truly universal progressive implementation of basic income that strengthens and supports our social safety net.
Strengthen and Support
Generally, any conversation on the design of universal basic income starts with the question “what programs can we cut?” We take the opposite approach — keep all existing safety net programs in place, with money received from basic income exempt from consideration when qualifying for these benefits. Rather than attempting to predict in advance which programs might or might not be redundant and risk leaving some people worse off, we should wait until we enact basic income — at that point, we can empirically assess whether certain programs are no longer necessary, and scale them back then. The one exception would be social security, where monthly payments would be supplemented to bring everyone up to a basic income level, rather than just adding basic income on top of existing payments.
Truly Universal
A core requirement of our approach to basic income is that it must be truly universal: citizens, permanent residents, and those in the US on a work or student visa would all receive full payments. Even undocumented immigrants would be eligible to receive basic income, although not until they had been residents for at least three years. For fulfilling basic needs to become a fundamental human right, it's critical that we not leave anyone behind.
Children would eligible to receive full benefits as well, although payments would be handled differently — 50% of the monthly amount would go to the parent(s), and the other 50% would go into a government bond Child Trust Account. These deposits would accumulate over time and become available as a lump sum on an individual's eighteenth birthday. This would be analogous to a “baby bond” and would serve to build wealth for the next generation.
Shared Prosperity
The initial amount given through basic income should be high enough to bring people above the federal poverty line — $12,000 going to every person each year. However, going forward, the amount would be pegged to GDP, rather than inflation. This would allow all residents of the country to share in the country's prosperity, with increasing national wealth translating directly into higher dividends. We could fully fund this approach through a combination of increased income, capital gains, and corporate taxes, supplemented by “helicopter money” directly created and issued by the federal government.
We live in the richest nation in the history of the world and have the wealth to provide all residents with a minimum standard of living. We can and should establish a basic income as a fundamental human right.
Updated July 28, at 9:30 a.m.:
The Senate rejected a "skinny repeal" of the Affordable Care Act, a partial repeal that was debated in the middle of the night between July 27 and 28.
According to CNN, Sens. Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins and John McCain opposed the bill that would have resulted in 16 million people losing their health insurance by 2026. The bill was considered the minimum repeal option that Republicans could agree on, according to the BBC. McCain's opposition came as a surprise to many, particularly after they voted in favor of allowing discussion on a repeal and replace package.
After yet another blow to the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act in favor of a GOP-approved option, President Trump tweeted their disappointment.
"3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!" they wrote.
Previously...
The Senate voted to reject a repeal of the Affordable Care Act without a replacement plan on Wednesday, July 26. According to the New York Times, senators will spend the rest of the week debating three possible amendments: Repeal and replace, partial repeal, and what has been called 'skinny' repeal.
A day prior, the Senate voted twice: first, to begin discussing a bill that would repeal major components of the Affordable Care Act, which resulted in a 50–50 tie broken by Vice President Mike Pence, who voted to allow the debate. Later, a vote to repeal and replace with a replacement plan was rejected, with 43 votes for the bill and 57 against.
Despite having announced a brain cancer diagnosis just days earlier, Republican Senator John McCain traveled from Arizona to Washington, D.C., to cast their vote in favor of advancing first vote to allow the discussion.
Senator McCain lamented the dubious process their colleagues employed to get their legislation to the brink of a vote, saying from the Senate floor, "We've tried to do this by coming up with a proposal behind closed doors in consultation with the administration, then springing it on skeptical members, trying to convince them it's better than nothing, asking us to swallow our doubts and force it past a unified opposition. I don't think that is going to work in the end.... Why don't we try the old way of legislating in the Senate, the way our rules and customs encourage us to act?”
Many, however, were quick to point out the hypocrisy of Senator McCain's speech, considering that they voted to proceed with debates.
Prior to that, Republicans had worked to pass a revised health care bill in private despite major concern from the public, in yet another failed attempt. One of the main causes, besides the daunting prospect of over 22 million people going uninsured under the first proposed bill, was the GOP's opaque legislative process.
On June 22, legislators unveiled a new Senate health care bill, again written in secret, featuring key differences with the one originally passed by the House, CNN reported. According to CNN, the Senate bill would continue the Medicaid expansion funding put in place by the Affordable Care Act through 2021, then phase it out over the course of three years. While the phasing out is more gradual than the House bill, The Washington Post reported that the cuts to the health care program for low-income people would be larger. As for the House bill, Planned Parenthood would be subjected to severe cuts in federal funding for one year, with future cuts imminent if the health care provider elects to continue performing abortions, according to The Washington Post.
Like Pac-Man chomping after power pellets, two separate bar-arcade ventures are hungry to get into the city's hottest commercial district.
Two groups – one backed by a local frozen yogurt franchisee, and the other steered by several well-known Richmond restaurateurs – are planning what may amount to dueling entertainment venues in the Scott's Addition neighborhood.
After more than a year of searching, Robert Lupica, a local business person and one of the original franchisees of Richmond-based fro-yo chain Sweet Frog, is planning their bar-arcade concept in a 6,300-square-foot portion of 3121 W. Leigh St.
A hip entertainment trend that's caught on in a number of large cities across the U.S., so-called bar and arcade combos typically blend classic arcade games, draft beer and food into a casual setting.
Lupica, who will own and manage the Scott's Addition venue, has signed a lease for the space and is targeting an April opening date.
While the name for the new venture is pending, Lupica said the arcade will host over 70 vintage pinball and arcade games from the '80s, '90s and 2000s. They include Mortal Kombat, Donkey Kong, NBA Jam, NFL Blitz and Pac-Man, more information on these retro arcade games can be found in this article. Board games, shuffleboard, giant Jenga, air hockey, skee ball and large projection screens with classic video games also will be offered at the site.
“These are games that are going to resonate with people 21 years of age and older,” Lupica said. “We want to have gaming leagues and tournaments…we really envision this place becoming a neighborhood hub.”
While Lupica would not disclose investment totals, they said many of the pinball and arcade games cost thousands of dollars each to secure.
Then there are the drinks.
Instead of a typical bar with a bartender, Lupica said their venture will use an automated “self-tabbing beer wall” with 60 craft beers, ciders and wine from local, regional and national breweries.
They said patrons will pay by the ounce, using a tap card provided by the venue. With the tap card, patrons can walk up to an iPad screen, swipe their card and pour their drink freely.
“We plan to have a beer connoisseur showing them how to use the taps and properly pour their beer…. This gives you options on taste testing the many options,” Lupica said. “It's up to the user to decide whether to reload the card or not.”
Lupica also has food in mind, and is planning a menu that will pair with several brews on tap.
Marty Mooradian, a broker with Richmond-based Marcus & Millichap, represented Lupica in the lease. They said Fultz & Singh Architects have been retained to handle the design of the space.
Lupica plans to submit permits for the venue to the city in five to seven days.
“The building is in pretty good condition, so getting in and making the changes we need to make will not take very long for us to get going,” Lupica said.
Meanwhile, Jason Alley and Michele Jones, co-owners of Comfort and Pasture restaurants, along with Saison owner Jay Bayer, are partnering yet again and finalizing plans to bring an arcade-brewery-restaurant combo concept to Scott's Addition.
Bayer would not disclose the location of the planned venture and no lease has been signed, but they said the group has been mulling over the idea for a while.
“It's going to be a good mix of video games and pinball machines,” Bayer said.
With Scott's Addition's many breweries, cideries and burgeoning food scene, Bayer said it was a matter of time before the bar-arcade concept slipped in.
“Part of what we have been excited by is the opportunity to be the living room for a neighborhood with such high density,” Bayer said. “Scott's Addition seems ready for something like this.”
Alley, Jones and Bayer are also teaming up to take over the former Balliceaux restaurant and bar in The Fan at 203 N. Lombardy St. They plan to reopen it as Flora, which will serve dishes native to the Yucatan Peninsula and Oaxaca regions of Mexico.
And Lupica may not stop at Scott's Addition – they said they plan to open two additional bars and arcade locations across metro Richmond.
We've been covering the rumored software update for Windows Phone 7 for sometime now, even having our forum members add some info to the mix. So far, the update is supposed to have the following features:
Bing turn-by-turn directions, improvements
Custom ringer support
Copy/Paste
Multi-tasking (of some form)
We have a feeling that's just the beginning, as Chris Walsh, known for their contribution to ChevronWP7, has evidently been leaked some info on the update, calling it "massive" and more tantalizingly, "MS took 3 months to do what Apple did in 3 years" and "Lets just say they could have called it Windows Phone 8"--that's exactly the kind of thing we and the market in general want to hear.
Whether or not it all bares fruit remains to be seen, but too many independent sources are all saying the same thing: the first update to Windows Phone 7 will impress.
Oh and one more thing (snicker), Chris promises some screenshots later today. Stay tuned.

MarineKingPrime.WE Interview
MarineKingPrime.WE. Photo by: Thisisgame.com
I had the opportunity to ask MarineKing a few questions after their second place finish at the GSL World Championships.
As anyone who reads my weekly column knows, I'm a big fan of MarineKing. Their creative and aggressive play is entertaining, but more than anything, I love how they wear their emotions on their sleeve. Just by watching their reactions after games you can tell that he's fiercely competitive and very passionate about StarCraft II.Below is the interview.MKP: It's my pleasure as this is the first time for me to interview for foreign fans. I'm good to have this chance.MKP: I did my best to prepare for the match against oGsMC at the World championships because I lost once as you know. So, I was rather eager to win when I fell behind 0:2. And I could focus on it and came up from behind. I kept my presence of mind and defended void rays and zealots inside my base. When I came to myself, I was seizing the chance to victory.MKP: The thor rush is very useful to use vs. Protoss as a sudden single-use strategy. Personally, I feel sorry losing that game in vain as I made a mistake in early stage, not repairing the bunker against 1 zealot and 2 stalkers. But I will use the thor rush whenever I have a match against Protoss in the future.MKP: You never touched a sore subject, don't worry. Rather, I'm proud of having 3 times of finals. The more I have final matches, the more earnest to win I become. So, I become enthusiastic more and more.MKP: Thank you. :DI also think it was the match against Kyrix in the round of 8 at season II the GSL open that I played most risky and nervously. And the match against oGsMC at the World Championship was hardest and happiest play I have played.MKP: I think it is my little strong point for me to control marines delicately compare to other players.MKP: If I have a chance, I will participate Korean matches as well as overseas tournaments.MKP: All of 3 players is top and it is hard to expect. Recently, I'm weak at tvt but NaDa is strong and I'm not sure I can win. For Zenio vs. Alicia, Alicia seems to win easily. Because Alicia is very good player and zvp is leaning to P.MKP: Of course, I want to be the best of SCII. But I also want to be the most popular and I want to remain long in fans' memories.MKP: I think dimaga and sen for zerg, jinro for terran, huk and whitera for protoss are as good as Korean players.MKP: I'm not good at English and I couldn't realize the popularity when I visited foreign fan sites. But I think I should play better to show good games to the fans hearing many foreign fans are cheering me. And I love the foreign fans as much as Korean fans, or more.MKP: I really appreciate for your support and good messages once again.
So it has been like 2 years man since I've visited KickStarter and at the bowling alley a few days ago Walter starts talking crazy about how in case of a Zombie apocalypse that they won't be just some civilian.
Got me thinking that a lot of my friends and people the Dude has met would make some interesting civilians to really tie a zombie game together or just have all of us on your shelf or your rug.
However still no cash. So I'm like asking for the help of the KickStarter backers to get a spincast resin mold made so the Dude and all their friends and come and join your next game.
Now I leave it to someone who talks as fast as Donny (may they rest in peace) to give you the details.
THE REWARDS:
A spincast resin set of all 11 unique characters + 2 extra variant figures + accessory sprue (so 14 total). The set will include all the figures you see in the below image however all figures will be sold unpainted and unassembled (Bathrobe Dude, Valkyrie, Old Man and the Trophy Wife all need a bit of glue to put them together). Figures are 28mm scale. Black plastic bases will be provided with the set.
ADD-ONs
(all add-on figures will be in metal (white metal pewter) - if you would like any of these items just increase your pledge amount to include them. Any figures are sold unpainted, are 28mm scale and come with a black plastic base.

The Team
Chris Adkerson and Tom Anders are the owners of Impact! Chris is a logistical and product development partner (and the guy who came up with the designs and concepts for the Urban Achievers miniatures) and Tom handles all the nuts and bolts to make the company run (web development, taxes, bookkeeping, inventory, shipping, etc.) If you see comments from Impact! ... it most likely Tom but could be Chris.
Andrew May was the sculptor for this figure range. Thanks Andrew.
Last but definitely NOT least
There is one major way that KickStarters are successful: Social Media. If you want to help us fund and then hit any stretch goals, please take a few moments to share the project on Facebook, send out a tweet on Twitter or start a thread on your favorite forum to discuss the project. Let the people know we are here so the project can be as successful as possible. And definitely for this KickStarter ... let your leagues know about this KickStarter ... pull together that group order and really save! Finally, thank you in advance for backing and helping support our project!
Tom @ Impact!
TRACKING INFORMATION ON THE PROJECT AND PLEDGES
Impact! believes in Kicking it Forward and we pledge to back other KickStarters with 5% of the profit of this KickStarter (just see our # of projects backed so far ... we take this very seriously!)
http://kickingitforward.org
And finally a post script item:
DISCLAIMER and spincast resin details:
Specs: The spincast resin to be used for this KickStarter is a hard (75D) heat resistant plastic resin. It is much harder, and tougher, than normal resin. It can withstand 320F, and can handle prolonged exposure at 150F with ease (so our Australian friends should not have any problems during the summer). It can be super-glued together, and takes standard miniature paints easily (you need to wash the figures first to remove any mold release agent that might still be on the miniature.)
Safety: The spincast resin should never be exposed to direct flame. Other than this , it has no special safety precautions, the dust in non- carcinogenic. However: all material dusts will irritate the lining of the lungs, and make existing conditions worse, so we recommend wearing a dust mask. Better safe than sorry! The spincast resin is safe to expose to INDIRECT heat. Unlike many plastics (PVC etc.) it does not give off toxic vapours. Heating the spincast resin to 320F from indirect head is safe, and a good way to soften the material in order to reposition parts (then plunge into cold water to set). AGAIN DO NOT EXPOSE SPINCAST RESIN to an open flame. Heck .. don't expose any resin or plastic toy from any company to direct flame. It is just a REALLY bad idea ... okay?.

Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said the hijackers on the Libyan plane which was hijacked on its way to Tripoli and diverted to Malta "surrendered, (were) searched, and (were) taken into custody."
Four hours after the Afriqiyah Airways A320 landed in Malta, the two hijackers gave themselves up to the Maltese authorities after they had first released the other 109 passengers and seven members of the crew.
The plane landed in Malta this morning at 11.32am, with sources initially saying that two hijackers on board the flight were threatening to blow up the aircraft. It had left Sebha at 10.10am on its way to Tripoli, but it was hijacked and diverted to Malta. TVM is reporting that the hijackers are armed with hand grenades and are Gaddafi supporters. One of them sported Libya's national flag at the time Muammar Gaddafi was in power.
Ali Milad, the pilot, told Libya Channel TV network that initially the hijackers had asked them to head to Rome. They identified the two hijackers as Moussa Shaha and Ahmed Ali, Libyans who other officials said were in their twenties.

The pilot said the men were seeking political asylum in Europe and wanted to set up a political party called "the New Fateh." Fateh is a reference to former Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who led Fateh revolution after their coup in 1969.
Sources told The Malta Independent that the two hijackers are Libyans from the south of the country. The sources said the two hijackers demanded asylum in Malta, but other reports say that they seek the setting up of a pro-Gaddafi political party in Libya.
The two hijackers are from the south of Libya, and are believed to be in their 20s.
It took more than two hours since the plane's landing for the hijackers to agree to the opening of the aircraft door and release the first passengers.

The plane's door was opened at 1.44pm and women and children were seen disembarking. This was followed by men, and by 2.37pm, a total of 109 passengers had disembarked. The passengers left the aircraft without carrying any hand luggage.
One man, believed to be one of the hijackers, was briefly seen at the top of the stairs leading to the aircraft with the old Libya flag, the all-green flag used by former leader Muamma Gaddafi. They and the second hijacker later disembarked from the plane, a few moments after the crew including the pilot left the aircraft.
They were both taken into custody and are being interrogated. They are expected to be arraigned in court in the coming hours.
The government later said initial forensic investigations about the hijack of the Air Afriqiyah flight shows that the weapons used were identical “replica” weapons. "Replica" weapons are imitation weapons. Some replica weapons could be used to fire like real weapons, while others do not have this capability. To the layperson's eye it is hard to distinguish between a replica weapon that can fire and one which doesn't.
The operation to ensure that the aircraft is safe from explosives or other arms was still ongoing at 7pm.
Passengers are also being held for questioning to establish the way the incident developed. They were all found to be in good health, were given food and water and will be returned to Libya later.

Members of the Armed Forces of Malta were seen going onto the plane when the situation was over.
The plane is an Afriqiyah Airways A320 which had 111 passengers on board, including 82 men, 28 women and one infant. T
The Prime Minister, in a tweet, said that women and children were disembarking, and in more tweets later, they said that 65 passengers had left the aircraft. Another tweet said that the remaining 44 passengers had been released, for a total of 109.

The Prime Minister immediately summoned the the National Security Committee at Castille when news of the hijack reached their office.
The negotiating team was on standby at Malta International Airport to hold negotiations with the hijackers, and this later led to the release of the passengers.
Brigadier Jeffrey Curmi led negotiations with the hijackers, The Malta Independent is informed.
An official from Afriqiyah Airways earlier said the two hijackers had expressed a willingness to release the passengers but that they will keep the pilot. They later however surrendered after releasing all the passengers and crew. Serraj al-Fitouri also told Dubai-based Al-Arabiya TV that one Libyan lawmaker was among the list of passengers.
In a first official statement issued soon after the plane landed, the government said the Prime Minister is at their office in Castille where the National Security Committee is coordinating the operation.
The Nationalist Party, in a statement, said the Opposition Leader was informed by the Prime Minister about the incident. The PN said it offered its full cooperation.
It has been established that #Afriqiyah flight has 111 passengers on board. 82 males, 28 females, 1 infant. — Joseph Muscat (@JosephMuscat_JM) 23 December 2016
Several emergency measures were at Malta International Airport. A spokesperson from the Armed Forces of Malta informed this newsroom that all AFM units, including the C 'Special Duties' company - which is the AFM's counterterrorism unit - was on alert.
Soon after the plane landed in Luqa, President Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca appealed for everyone to remain calm and follow official updates.
Archbishop Charles Scicluna is praying for the safety and security of all those on-board.
All roads leading to the airport were blocked for the duration of the hijack.
The last hijacking in Malta was aboard EgyptAir Flight 648 back in 1985. It was an ordeal that ended in bloodshed. The storming of the EgyptAir plane back then resulted in the deaths of 62 people. Only one of the three hijackers survived and was brought to justice.

Six Case Western Reserve scientists are part of an international team that has discovered two compounds that show promise in decreasing inflammation associated with diseases such as ulcerative colitis, arthritis and multiple sclerosis. The compounds, dubbed OD36 and OD38, specifically appear to curtail inflammation-triggering signals from RIPK2 (serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase 2). RIPK2 is an enzyme that activates high-energy molecules to prompt the immune system to respond with inflammation. The findings of this research appear in the Journal of Biological Chemistry.
"This is the first published indication that blocking RIPK2 might be efficacious in inflammatory disease," said senior author Derek Abbott, MD, PhD, associate professor of pathology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. "Our data provides a strong rationale for further development and optimization of RIPK2-targeted pharmaceuticals and diagnostics."
In addition to Abbott and their medical school colleagues, the research team included representatives of Oncodesign, a therapeutic molecule biotechnology company in Dijon, France; Janssen Research & Development, a New Jersey-based pharmaceutical company;andAsclepia Outsourcing Solutions, a Belgium-based medicinal chemistry company.
The normal function of RIPK2 is to send warning signals to cells that bacterial infection has occurred, which in turn spurs the body to mobilize white blood cells. The white blood cells identify and encircle pathogens, which cause blood to accumulate in the region. It is this blood build-up that leads to the red and swollen areas characteristic of inflammation. When this process goes awry, the inflammation increases dramatically and tissue destruction ensues. RIPK2 works in conjunction with NOD1 and NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain) proteins in controlling responses by the immune system that lead to this inflammation process.
In this research project, investigators applied state-of-the-art genetic sequencing to learn the unique set of genes driven specifically by NOD2 proteins. They ultimately zeroed in on three specific NOD2-driven inflammation genes (SLC26a, MARCKSL1, and RASGRP1) that guided investigators in finding the most effective compounds.
Oncodesign searched its library of 4,000 compounds that targeted kinases, and after exhaustive study, narrowed the selection down to 13. Then investigators tested the 13 compounds in mouse and human cells and found that two compounds, OD36 and OD38, were most effective in blocking RIPK2.
"Based on the design of OD36 and OD38, we have developed with Oncodesign fifth-generation compounds that are even more effective than the first-generation OD36 and OD38," Abbott said. "Our next step is to seek a larger pharmaceutical company that can move these compounds forward into Phase 1 clinical trials in humans."
From Tiexue & Mop:
Shocking, the entire process of how Guangzhou restaurants make boiled alive cat
[Warning: Pictures may be graphic.]
Cat restaurants hidden on the outskirts of town, “boiled alive cat” attract people's attention
Cat meat 10 yuan/500g, cat brain 30 yuan/500g, cat intestines 50 yuan/500g
What is “boiled alive cat”?
Cook: “[The cat] cannot be completely beaten to death, [because] it also needs to be boiled a little, this is what ‘live cooked cat' is.”
Why do so many people like eating cat?
Cat eater: Eating cat meat can cure asthma, is a health supplement [something eaten for health benefits].
A stray cat wholesale market has over a thousand cats packed into metal cages.
The majority of the cat trade is sold to Guangdong, because in Lingnan cuisine, Guangdong people [Cantonese] especially like to eat cat; It first became popular in the Chaozhou-Shantou region. Cat meat has been traditionally believed to be effective for helping a person's yin and yang balance, whereas recorded in Guangdong Yue cuisine recipies is a dish called “Long hu dou” [literally, “dragon fighting tiger”. The reason why cat meat is held in esteem lies in the naive belief of its eaters that it has a “health supplementing/boosting” effect.
Heartbreaking innocent expressions, awaiting the fate of being eaten.
Below is the process of cooking cats. Cat lovers, please prepare yourselves.
A “cat restaurant” cook holds up a white cat from the fur-removal machine.
To show what a good deal it is, a house cat with its fur removed is hung on a hook publicly to be weighed.
Still breathing house cat put in boiling water and cooked alive.
Cook removes the internal organs of the “white cat”.
Do you see it? The cat's paw is still in here.
“Express” reporter also discovered in an interview: To guarantee the freshness of the cat meat, most cat meat restaurants have adopted “live cooked cat”, “beating”, and similar methods of slaughtering live cats. “The more suffering, the better the taste. Doing it like this is to ensure that the blood is fully soaked into the flesh, and that the flavor of the cat meat prepared tastes great.”
Those who have scrolled this far to read these words, please forward/repost this on, and pray for these shameless diners, because you [they, the diners] will suffer retribution in the future!!!
Comments from Tiexue:
为民服务:
Hey, it looks like it could be pretty fragrant/delicious…
rxs1976:
Know why Western countries look down upon us Chinese people now? Why European and American countries are hollering for Chinese people to get [out of their countries]? Since we are working hard to join the world, why not reject some ugly eating habits??
军盲一号:
Why can't cat meat be eaten??? Who can give me a reason??? Cow, sheep, pig can all be eaten, why can't cat and dogs be eaten??? I think aside from human meat, anything can be eaten!!!
拳打美国脚踢日本:
Please do not engage in regional discrimination. Not all Cantonese people necessarily eat [this], right?
珍贵:
According to logic/reason, anything can be eaten, as this is animal instinct, [but] according to [personal] feelings, eating cat is indeed something I could not stomach. After all, [it] is the closest [animal] to humans, a member of the family.
铁血网鹋:
I personally do not support eating cat, but that is just my personal habits/belief. There is no reason whatsoever that cats cannot be eaten. Humans are omnivores, so anything that is not poisonous can be eaten. Pigs, cows, sheep, fish, whatever are all life, so if we want to say it is cruel, everyone become vegetarian then. If we want to say it is life, then eat air. It doesn't hurt life, and is definitely not cruel. You will have a good conscience then.
q8383171:
I don't like to eat cat, and also feel killing cats is cruel, but if other people like to eat cats, then that is their freedom, just like us eating pigs. However, killing a cat is one thing, abusing it to death is excessive.
tensn:
It is okay to eat [cat], but one must eat with dignity! Aren't pigs, cows, and sheep all stunned before slaughtering these days? Be a little more humane, as this [way of slaughtering] is indeed cruel! [Those who] eat live monkey brain and stuff like that, are even more deserving of being struck down by heaven!
外蒙回归司令部:
Cats are human's companions, completely different from pigs, cows, sheep, and other animals used for meat. There are also many poached wild animals that also should not be eaten. Society should put an end to these uncivilized behaviors!
前主炮:
Who am I supposed to be afraid of? I've even eaten human placenta before. Humans are devils.
燕赵游侠:
So sad, I've raised so many cats, and really like them.

Several years ago, there were reports saying something about people eating baby soup. Later, it was proven to be fake, a rumor created by an anti-China person. How authentic is this post?

“When push comes to shove, water could become the real throttle on renewable energy,” said Michael E. Webber, an assistant professor at the University of Texas in Austin who studies the relationship between energy and water.
Photo
Conflicts over water could shape the future of many energy technologies. The most water-efficient renewable technologies are not necessarily the most economical, but water shortages could give them a competitive edge.
In California, solar developers have already been forced to switch to less water-intensive technologies when local officials have refused to turn on the tap. Other big solar projects are mired in disputes with state regulators over water consumption.
To date, the flashpoint for such conflicts has been the Southwest, where dozens of multibillion-dollar solar power plants are planned for thousands of acres of desert. While most forms of energy production consume water, its availability is especially limited in the sunny areas that are otherwise well suited for solar farms.
At public hearings from Albuquerque to San Luis Obispo, Calif., local residents have sounded alarms over the impact that this industrialization will have on wildlife, their desert solitude and, most of all, their water.
Joni Eastley, chairperson of the county commission in Nye County, Nev., which includes Amargosa Valley, said at one hearing that their area had been “inundated” with requests from renewable energy developers that “far exceed the amount of available water.”
Many projects involve building solar thermal plants, which use cheaper technology than the solar panels often seen on roofs. In such plants, mirrors heat a liquid to create steam that drives an electricity-generating turbine. As in a fossil fuel power plant, that steam must be condensed back to water and cooled for reuse.
Photo
The conventional method is called wet cooling. Hot water flows through a cooling tower where the excess heat evaporates along with some of the water, which must be replenished constantly. An alternative, dry cooling, uses fans and heat exchangers, much like a car's radiator. Far less water is consumed, but dry cooling adds costs and reduces efficiency — and profits.

The efficiency problem is especially acute with the most tried-and-proven technique, using mirrors arrayed in long troughs. “Trough technology has been more financeable, but now trough presents a separate risk — water,” said Nathaniel Bullard, a solar analyst with New Energy Finance, a London research firm.
That could provide opportunities for developers of photovoltaic power plants, which take the type of solar panels found on residential rooftops and mount them on the ground in huge arrays. They are typically more expensive and less efficient than solar thermal farms but require a relatively small amount of water, mainly to wash the panels.
In California alone, plans are under way for 35 large-scale solar projects that, in bright sunshine, would generate 12,000 megawatts of electricity, equal to the output of about 10 nuclear power plants.
Their water use would vary widely. BrightSource Energy's dry-cooled Ivanpah project in Southern California would consume an estimated 25 million gallons a year, mainly to wash mirrors. But a wet-cooled solar trough power plant barely half Ivanpah's size proposed by the Spanish developer Abengoa Solar would draw 705 million gallons of water in an area of the Mojave Desert that receives scant rainfall.
One of the most contentious disputes is over a proposed wet-cooled trough plant that NextEra Energy Resources, a subsidiary of the utility giant FPL Group, plans to build in a dry area east of Bakersfield, Calif.
Photo
NextEra wants to tap freshwater wells to supply the 521 million gallons of cooling water the plant, the Beacon Solar Energy Project, would consume in a year, despite a state policy against the use of drinking-quality water for power plant cooling.
Mike Edminston, a city council member from nearby California City, warned at a hearing that groundwater recharge was already “not keeping up with the utilization we have.”

The fight over water has moved into the California Legislature, where a bill has been introduced to allow renewable energy power plants to use drinking water for cooling if certain conditions are met.

“By allowing projects to use fresh water, the bill would remove any incentives that developers have to use technologies that minimize water use,” said Terry O'Brien, a California Energy Commission deputy director.
NextEra has resisted using dry cooling but is considering the feasibility of piping in reclaimed water. “At some point if costs are just layered on, a project becomes uncompetitive,” said Michael O'Sullivan, a senior vice president at NextEra.
Water disputes forced Solar Millennium to abandon wet cooling for a proposed solar trough power plant in Ridgecrest, Calif., after the water district refused to supply the 815 million gallons of water a year the project would need. The company subsequently proposed to dry cool two other massive Southern California solar troughs farms it wants to build in the Mojave Desert.
Photo
“We will not do any wet cooling in California,” said Rainer Aringhoff, president of Solar Millennium's American operations. “There are simply no plants being permitted here with wet cooling.”
One solar developer, BrightSource Energy, hopes to capitalize on the water problem with a technology that focuses mirrors on a tower, producing higher-temperature steamer than trough systems. The system can use dry cooling without suffering a prohibitive decline in power output, said Tom Doyle, an executive vice president at BrightSource.
The greater water efficiency was one factor that led VantagePoint Venture Partners, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, to invest in BrightSource. “Our approach is high sensitivity to water use,” said Alan E. Salzman, VantagePoint's chief executive. “We thought that was going to be huge differentiator.”
Even solar projects with low water consumption face hurdles, however. Tessera Solar is planning a large project in the California desert that would use only 12 million gallons annually, mostly to wash mirrors. But because it would draw upon a severely depleted aquifer, Tessera may have to buy rights to 10 times that amount of water and then retire the pumping rights to the water it does not use. For a second big solar farm, Tessera has agreed to fund improvements to a local irrigation district in exchange for access to reclaimed water.
“We have a challenge in finding water even though we're low water use,” said Sean Gallagher, a Tessera executive. “It forces you to do some creative deals.”

In the Amargosa Valley, Solar Millennium may have to negotiate access to water with scores of individuals and companies who own the right to stick a straw in the aquifer, so to speak, and withdraw a prescribed amount of water each year.
“There are a lot of people out here for whom their water rights are their life savings, their retirement,” said Ed Goedhart, a local farmer and state legislator, as they drove past pockets of sun-beaten mobile homes and luminescent patches of irrigated alfalfa. Farmers will be growing less of the crop, they said, if they decide to sell their water rights to Solar Millennium.
“We'll be growing megawatts instead of alfalfa,” Mr. Goedhart said.
While water is particularly scarce in the West, it is becoming a problem all over the country as the population grows. Daniel M. Kammen, director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, predicted that as intensive renewable energy development spreads, water issues will follow.
“When we start getting 20 percent, 30 percent or 40 percent of our power from renewables,” Mr. Kammen said, “water will be a key issue.”
LEICESTER, England — How great is the Leicester City underdog story? Well, let's just say that a four-day visit to the East Midlands—aka, the center of the soccer universe, circa 2016—can produce multiple stories that restore your faith in the inspirational power of sports.
This much is fact: If Leicester City can hold onto its Premier League lead—currently at five points with seven games to go—it will be the greatest season-long surprise champion in the history of professional team sports. Remember, Leicester was a 5,000-to-1 shot to win the Premier League before the season, roughly the same odds of a No. 15 seed winning the NCAA basketball tournament (which, obviously, has never happened).
And so fantastic stories are everywhere in Leicester these days. I wrote one on the LCFC phenomenon for Sports Illustrated magazine and another on an American couple—named the Foxes, aptly enough—who turned a trip to see their favorite team into a celebration of their engagement. And now, because there was so much good material on this trip, I want to introduce you to the people I spoke to in Leicester, the people who are living this true-life fairytale every day.
They even introduce themselves like characters in a play.
“Do you want me to introduce myself?” says club ambassador Alan Birchenall, 70, a former Leicester midfielder, grabbing hold of my audio recorder. “I'm Alan Birchenall. Everyone calls me The Birch. Or Birchy. Ex-player from the Jurassic Period, as you can see from the pictures.”
We're sitting in The Birch's office just inside the front door at Leicester's humble training ground. With barely any square inches to spare, their walls are covered with Leicester team photos from over the years.
“This is every team since I joined over four decades,” says The Birch. “I've seen promotion, relegation, administration, going down to the third level a few years ago, and now this. I've seen everything here at this football club until this season, and you'll never see anything like this again!”
The Birch had a hip operation not long ago, and so they watch Leicester games sitting on a chair at the exit of the players tunnel at King Power Stadium.
“You used to walk around this city, and you'd see Man United shirts, Arsenal shirts, Chelsea shirts, Liverpool shirts,” they say. “Now the majority of the kids are wearing Leicester City shirts! In my local post office, there's always banter. This lady must have been in their 90s, she'd never been to a football match in their life. But they told me, ‘I know that voice. You're that bloke from Leicester City on the radio!' And all the sudden she's talking to me about Jamie Vardy scoring goals.”
To hear The Birch describe it, Leicester used to be like one of those towns on the New Jersey Turnpike—just another exit number—except in England it's the M1 running past.
"We were that place off Junction 21 on the M1 coming up from London," they say. "Nobody noticed us. People just whizzed by on the M1. But nobody whizzes past now. Every car that goes up and down that M1 will see the sign for Leicester and say: 'They're doing well, aren't they?'"

There's a new character everywhere you go in Leicester these days.
Here's Claudio Ranieri, 64, the Foxes' first-year Italian manager, who combines the attributes of a kindly grandfather who'll buy you a gelato with the iron will of someone whose playing career exceeded their skillset. Ranieri literally promised their Leicester players a pizza party if they kept their first clean sheet of the season, and in October they gave them one.
“Yes,” says Ranieri, who has a chance to win their first top-flight league title, “because we concede every time goals [before that]. So I say, ‘O.K., the first clean sheet I pay the pizza to you. But just one pizza! If not, they are fat!”
(Having visited Peter's Pizza with my friend Nathen McVittie, I can tell you: The pizza's great.)
Here's Arlo White, the NBC Premier League broadcaster, who's a Leicester native. White never suspected they would be calling pivotal Premier League title-race games involving the team from their hometown. But here we are. White knows their history and context, knows that nearby rival Nottingham used to have a leg up on Leicester in terms of underdog soccer stories—Nottingham Forest under Brian Clough earned promotion to the top flight in 1976-77, won the title the following season and raised the European Cup the next two seasons—and in terms of historical events.
But the 2012 discovery of King Richard III's remains under a Leicester parking lot changed things, as has Leicester City's magical run this season.
“Leicester is not a one-horse town. It's a significant city, top 10 in terms of size in the country,” says White. “But it has always been overshadowed by Nottingham in the Midlands area. If you look at any inferiority complex Leicester might have had with Nottingham, they have Robin Hood, well now Leicester has Richard III. So they've almost equalized in terms of medieval characters. You couldn't write this stuff!”
And here's Leicester's deputy mayor, Rory Palmer, who's still processing all the global interest in their city.
“Leicester is a city where we don't always punch our weight on the national stage,” they say. “Now everybody wants to shout from the rooftops that they're from Leicester.”
And if Leicester were to win the Premier League? Are city leaders ready for that party?
“That's the question,” Palmer says. “In some ways, I don't want to answer and tempt fate. One thing we can say is if Leicester City win the Premier League we'll probably have the party to end all parties in Leicester. People will be wanting to celebrate not just long into the night but probably long into the next week.”

Here is Kasper Schmeichel, Leicester City's goalkeeper. The Foxes have some remarkable stories: Vardy, who's had a storybook rise from semipro soccer at age 25 to Premier League Golden Boot chaser at 29; captain Wes Morgan, the Nottingham native and tattoo shop owner who toppled the U.S. while playing for Jamaica at last year's Gold Cup; and Riyad Mahrez and N'Golo Kanté, two whip-smart signings who were playing in the French lower divisions not long ago.
But it's Schmeichel, the son of legendary Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, who among the Leicester players best puts into words what's happening with this special team right now:
SI: In pure football terms, how have you guys been so successful this season?
Schmeichel: I think it's got a lot to do with our mentality, our belief. We play to our strengths. We don't try to be something that we're not. We know we're not technically the most gifted team in the world, but we can play very, very well if w have to. We can also grind results out, and that's the way you build very good seasons.
SI: If you were being honest at the beginning of the season and I said you'd be top of the league in the stretch run, what would your response have been?
​Schmeichel: I mean, to be honest I wouldn't have thought we'd be top. With the team we had, top eight was realistic, top six would be really, really good. So obviously this is good at the moment. For us, nothing is won yet. The season is still a long way before it's finished, so we aren't getting ahead of ourselves.
SI: You've been on a lot of teams. What's special inside this team that you almost never see?
Schmeichel: There's so much respect between all the players in the dressing room, which creates a good spirit. It means you can have a lot of laughs and jokes at and with each other, because you know the respect is there. We're a group of players that in football terms has been together for a long time, three or four years for some of us. We're a group that's experienced some great highs and some quite horrible lows. So it's brought the team very much together, and there's a core of players that know the values of the team, the values of the club. And the new players coming in have all been fantastic and bought into that and understood that straight away, which has been phenomenal. A lot of it goes down to the scouting department. I don't think they just scout for players' ability, they scout for their mentality as well.
SI: Claudio Ranieri has coached at some pretty big clubs, and yet their previous job before coming here with Greece didn't go well. What was your reaction when they were hired last summer?
Schmeichel: It's a long time since he'd been in England, so we didn't know too much about their methods and what they were going to do. And to their credit, the first week they didn't really say a lot. They just looked at how we did things. He's basically just kept that going. They could see we had a special group and had momentum. That's where I think they deserve the most credit: They didn't want to go in and tamper with that, because it might have been detrimental to the team.
It's a manager's prerogative. Most managers do go in and want to change and do things their way. But why change something that was working? That's the difficult thing for a manager to do, is to maybe compromise a little bit with their own beliefs or values and go with sort of what was there, which was very much to their credit.
SI: Whether it's Ranieri or a lot of the players on this Leicester team, a lot of you have been told at some point that you're not good enough.
​Schmeichel: Yeah. A lot of players here, including myself, have been to other clubs and had success and had some not-so-successful periods as well.
Those are the times that sculpt you and shape you as a man, as a player. The easy times are when you're winning. Everything's fine, nothing can go wrong. But when things go wrong, that's when you sort of learn about yourself and your teammates.
This team has been through highs and lows, and you learn a lot about each other. People having that type of rejection at other places stokes the fire inside you, and you have a personal desire to do well, that nothing's going to hold you back. And you keep going with the mentality that you're going to succeed no matter what. A lot of the players here have that mentality.
SI: Have you allowed yourself to imagine the possibility of winning this Premier League title?
Schmeichel: I mean, as a kid you dream of winning the Premier League and the FA Cup and the Champions League. All those things. And growing up you still have that dream. You become more realistic on things, maybe, but no matter what I think it's important to dream. From the day I decided to become a professional footballer, my dream was to win the Premier League. Otherwise, why would you play? You're in a position now where you're top of the league, and we have to keep going. But for the title? Who knows? We don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Right now it's the next game that's the important one.
SI: Is there a moment where you've seen the response Leicester City's story is getting where you're like, “This is crazy.”
Schmeichel: Everywhere you go now—to a restaurant, to a petrol station—everyone is just saying, “I hope you win it.” The football romantics would like us to win it because it's a great story, and 5,000-to-1 is quite a longshot. But it just goes to show that you can capture the imagination of a person by playing a certain way and with passion and spirit and heart. Every player on this team epitomizes that, and that's why they've endeared themselves to the footballing world.
There's a story everywhere you turn in Leicester these days, from Schmeichel and The Birch to Arlo and Ranieri to Vardy and Richard III and the engaged American Foxes.
In sports, it doesn't get much better than this. Seven games to go.
I got to know Charles “Chip” Sebens back in 2012, when they emailed to ask if they could spend the summer at Caltech. Chip is a graduate student in the philosophy department at the University of Michigan, and like many philosophers of physics, knows the technical background behind relativity and quantum mechanics very well. Chip had funding from NSF, and I like talking to philosophers, so I said why not?
We had an extremely productive summer, focusing on our different stances toward quantum mechanics. At the time I was a casual adherent of the Everett (many-worlds) formulation, but had never thought about it carefully. Chip was skeptical, in particular because they thought there were good reasons to believe that EQM should predict equal probabilities for being on any branch of the wave function, rather than the amplitude-squared probabilities of the real-world Born Rule. Fortunately, I won, although the reason I won was mostly because Chip figured out what was going on. We ended up writing a paper explaining why the Born Rule naturally emerges from EQM under some simple assumptions. Now I have graduated from being a casual adherent to a slightly more serious one.
But that doesn't mean Everett is right, and it's worth looking at other formulations. Chip was good enough to accept my request that they write a guest blog post about another approach that's been in the news lately: a “Newtonian” or “Many-Interacting-Worlds” formulation of quantum mechanics, which they have helped to pioneer.
In Newtonian physics objects always have definite locations. They are never in two places at once. To determine how an object will move one simply needs to add up the various forces acting on it and from these calculate the object's acceleration. This framework is generally taken to be inadequate for explaining the quantum behavior of subatomic particles like electrons and protons. We are told that quantum theory requires us to revise this classical picture of the world, but what picture of reality is supposed to take its place is unclear. There is little consensus on many foundational questions: Is quantum randomness fundamental or a result of our ignorance? Do electrons have well-defined properties before measurement? Is the Schrödinger equation always obeyed? Are there parallel universes?
Some of us feel that the theory is understood well enough to be getting on with. Even though we might not know what electrons are up to when no one is looking, we know how to apply the theory to make predictions for the results of experiments. Much progress has been made―observe the wonder of the standard model―without answering these foundational questions. Perhaps one day with insight gained from new physics we can return to these basic questions. I will call those with such a mindset the doers. Richard Feynman was a doer:
“It will be difficult. But the difficulty really is psychological and exists in the perpetual torment that results from your saying to yourself, ‘But how can it be like that?' which is a reflection of uncontrolled but utterly vain desire to see it in terms of something familiar. I will not describe it in terms of an analogy with something familiar; I will simply describe it. … I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics. … Do not keep saying to yourself, if you can possibly avoid it, ‘But how can it be like that?' because you will get ‘down the drain', into a blind alley from which nobody has yet escaped. Nobody knows how it can be like that.” -Feynman, The Character of Physical Law (chapter 6, pg. 129)
In contrast to the doers, there are the dreamers. Dreamers, although they may often use the theory without worrying about its foundations, are unsatisfied with standard presentations of quantum mechanics. They want to know “how it can be like that” and have offered a variety of alternative ways of filling in the details. Doers denigrate the dreamers for being unproductive, getting lost “down the drain.” Dreamers criticize the doers for giving up on one of the central goals of physics, understanding nature, to focus exclusively on another, controlling it. But even by the lights of the doer's primary mission―being able to make accurate predictions for a wide variety of experiments―there are reasons to dream:
“Suppose you have two theories, A and B, which look completely different psychologically, with different ideas in them and so on, but that all consequences that are computed from each are exactly the same, and both agree with experiment. … how are we going to decide which one is right? There is no way by science, because they both agree with experiment to the same extent. … However, for psychological reasons, in order to guess new theories, these two things may be very far from equivalent, because one gives a man different ideas from the other. By putting the theory in a certain kind of framework you get an idea of what to change. … Therefore psychologically we must keep all the theories in our heads, and every theoretical physicist who is any good knows six or seven different theoretical representations for exactly the same physics.” -Feynman, The Character of Physical Law (chapter 7, pg. 168)
In the spirit of finding alternative versions of quantum mechanics―whether they agree exactly or only approximately on experimental consequences―let me describe an exciting new option which has recently been proposed by Hall, Deckert, and Wiseman (in Physical Review X) and myself (forthcoming in Philosophy of Science), receiving media attention in: Nature, New Scientist, Cosmos, Huffington Post, Huffington Post Blog, FQXi podcast… Somewhat similar ideas have been put forward by Böstrom, Schiff and Poirier, and Tipler. The new approach seeks to take seriously quantum theory's hydrodynamic formulation which was developed by Erwin Madelung in the 1920s. Although the proposal is distinct from the many-worlds interpretation, it also involves the postulation of parallel universes. The proposed multiverse picture is not the quantum mechanics of college textbooks, but just because the theory looks so “completely different psychologically” it might aid the development of new physics or new calculational techniques (even if this radical picture of reality ultimately turns out to be incorrect).
Let's begin with an entirely reasonable question a dreamer might ask about quantum mechanics.
“I understand water waves and sound waves. These waves are made of particles. A sound wave is a compression wave that results from particles of air bunching up in certain regions and vacating other. Waves play a central role in quantum mechanics. Is it possible to understand these waves as being made of some things?”
There are a variety of reasons to think the answer is no, but they can be overcome. In quantum mechanics, the state of a system is described by a wave function Ψ. Consider a single particle in the famous double-slit experiment. In this experiment the one particle initially passes through both slits (in its quantum way) and then at the end is observed hitting somewhere on a screen. The state of the particle is described by a wave function which assigns a complex number to each point in space at each time. The wave function is initially centered on the two slits. Then, as the particle approaches the detection screen, an interference pattern emerges; the particle behaves like a wave.
There's a problem with thinking of the wave as made of something: the wave function assigns strange complex numbers to points in space instead of familiar real numbers. This can be resolved by focusing on |Ψ|2, the squared amplitude of the wave function, which is always a positive real number.
We normally think of |Ψ|2 as giving the probability of finding the particle somewhere. But, to entertain the dreamer's idea about quantum waves, let's instead think of |Ψ|2 as giving a density of particles. Whereas figure 2 is normally interpreted as showing the evolution of the probability distribution for a single particle, instead understand it as showing the distribution of a large number of particles: initially bunched up at the two slits and later spread out in bands at the detector (figure 3). Although I won't go into the details here, we can actually understand the way that wave changes in time as resulting from interactions between these particles, from the particles pushing each other around. The Schrödinger equation, which is normally used to describe the way the wave function changes, is then viewed as consequence of this interaction.
In solving the problem about complex numbers, we've created two new problems: How can there really be a large number of particles if we only ever see one show up on the detector at the end? If |Ψ|2 is now telling us about densities and not probabilities, what does it have to do with probabilities?
Removing a simplification in the standard story will help. Instead of focusing on the wave function of a single particle, let's consider all particles at once. To describe the state of a collection of particles it turns out we can't just give each particle its own wave function. This would miss out on an important feature of quantum mechanics: entanglement. The state of one particle may be inextricably linked to the state of another. Instead of having a wave function for each particle, a single universal wave function describes the collection of particles.
The universal wave function takes as input a position for each particle as well as the time. The position of a single particle is given by a point in familiar three dimensional space. The positions of all particles can be given by a single point in a very high dimensional space, configuration space: the first three dimensions of configuration space give the position of particle 1, the next three give the position of particle 2, etc. The universal wave function Ψ assigns a complex number to each point of configuration space at each time. |Ψ|2 then assigns a positive real number to each point of configuration space (at each time). Can we understand this as a density of some things?
A single point in configuration space specifies the locations of all particles, a way all things might be arranged, a way the world might be. If there is only one world, then only one point in configuration space is special: it accurately captures where all the particles are. If there are many worlds, then many points in configuration space are special: each accurately captures where the particles are in some world. We could describe how densely packed these special points are, which regions of configuration space contain many worlds and which regions contain few. We can understand |Ψ|2 as giving the density of worlds in configuration space. This might seem radical, but it is the natural extension of the answer to the dreamer's question depicted in figure 3.
Now that we have moved to a theory with many worlds, the first problem above can be answered: The reason that we only see one particle hit the detector in the double-slit experiment is that only one of the particles in figure 3 is in our world. When the particles hit the detection screen at the end we only see our own. The rest of the particles, though not part of our world, do interact with ours. They are responsible for the swerves in our particle's trajectory. (Because of this feature, Hall, Deckert, and Wiseman have coined the name “Many Interacting Worlds” for the approach.)
No matter how knowledgeable and observant you are, you cannot know precisely where every single particle in the universe is located. Put another way, you don't know where our world is located in configuration space. Since the regions of configuration space where |Ψ|2 is large have more worlds in them and more people like you wondering which world they're in, you should expect to be in a region of configuration space where|Ψ|2 is large. (Aside: this strategy of counting each copy of oneself as equally likely is not so plausible in the old many-worlds interpretation.) Thus the connection between |Ψ|2 and probability is not a fundamental postulate of the theory, but a result of proper reasoning given this picture of reality.
There is of course much more to the story than what's been said here. One particularly intriguing consequence of the new approach is that the three sentence characterization of Newtonian physics with which this post began is met. In that sense, this theory makes quantum mechanics look like classical physics. For this reason, in my paper I gave the theory the name “Newtonian Quantum Mechanics.”

These are among the findings of a recent study that delves into the language of deception, detailed in the paper Evidence for the Pinocchio Effect: Linguistic Differences Between Lies, Deception by Omissions, and Truths, which was published in the journal Discourse Processes.
Asked why the topic of deception is important to business research, negotiation expert Deepak Malhotra responds: "As it turns out, some people will lie and cheat in business."
Malhotra, the Eli Goldston Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School, coauthored the paper with Associate Professor Lyn M. Van Swol and doctoral candidate Michael T. Braun, both from the University of Wisconsin—Madison. "Most people admit to having lied in negotiations, and everyone believes they've been lied to in these contexts," Malhotra says. "We may be able to improve the situation if we can equip people to detect and deter the unethical behavior of others."
“Just like Pinocchio's nose, the number of words grew along with the lie”
"Evidence for the Pinocchio Effect" fills a key gap in the field of deception research, says Van Swol, the study's lead author. Previous studies have examined the linguistic differences between lies and truthful statements. But this one goes a step further to consider the differences between flat-out lying and so-called deception by omission—that is, the willful avoidance of divulging important information, either by changing the subject or by saying as little as possible.
The Ultimatum Game
To garner a sample of truth tellers, liars, and deceivers by omission, the researchers recruited 104 participants to play the ultimatum game, a popular tool among experimental economists. In the traditional version of the game, one player (the allocator) receives a sum of money and proposes how to divvy it up with a partner (the receiver). The receiver has the option of either accepting the proposed split or refusing the allocator's proposal—in which case neither player gets any of the money. Because receivers will often reject offers they perceive as unfair, leaving both parties with nothing, it behooves the allocator to offer an amount that will be deemed fair by the receiver. In many instances, allocators choose to share half, Malhotra says.
For the purposes of the deception experiment, the rules of the ultimatum game differed from the traditional version in three ways. First, in this version, the allocator received an endowment of either $30 or $5 to share with the receiver. The receiver had no way of verifying how much money the allocator had been given, information which the allocator was not required to divulge. Hence, an allocator could conceivably give the receiver $2 and keep $28, and the receiver would be none the wiser, perhaps assuming only $5 was in play. The second change was that if the receiver rejected the allocator's offer they or they would receive a default amount of $7.50 (or $1.25)—whereas the allocator would get no money at all.
Finally, each game included two minutes of videotaped conversation in which the receiver could grill the allocator with questions, prior to deciding whether to accept or reject the offer. This provided ample opportunity for the allocator to tell the truth about the money, lie, or try to avoid the subject altogether. "We wanted to create a situation where people could choose to lie or not lie, and it would happen naturally," Van Swol says.
Ultimately, the receiver had to decide whether the proposed allocation was fair and honest, based only on a conversation with the allocator. Thus, it behooved the allocator to be either a fair person or a good liar.
As it turned out, 70 percent of the allocators were honest, telling the receivers the true amount of the endowment and/or offering them at least half of the pot. The remaining 30 percent of allocators were classified either as liars (meaning they flat-out lied about the amount of the endowment) or as deceivers by omission (meaning they evaded questions about the amount of the endowment, but ultimately offered the receiver less than half).
After a graduate student transcribed all the allocator/receiver conversations, the researchers carefully analyzed the linguistic content, comparing the truth tellers against the liars and deceivers in order to suss out cues for deception. They looked for both strategic and nonstrategic language cues.
"A strategic cue is a conscious strategy to reduce the likelihood of the deception being detected," Van Swol explains, "whereas a nonstrategic cue is an emotional response, and people aren't usually aware that they're doing it."
Key Findings: Word Count, Profanity, And Pronouns
In terms of strategic cues, the researchers discovered the following:
Bald-faced liars tended to use many more words during the ultimatum game than did truth tellers, presumably in an attempt to win over suspicious receivers. Van Swol dubbed this "the Pinocchio effect." "Just like Pinocchio's nose, the number of words grew along with the lie," they say.
Allocators who engaged in deception by omission, on the other hand, used fewer words and shorter sentences than truth tellers.
Among the findings related to nonstrategic cues:
On average, liars used more swear words than did truth tellers—especially in cases where the recipients voiced suspicion about the true amount of the endowment. "We think this may be due to the fact that it takes a lot of cognitive energy to lie," Van Swol says. "Using so much of your brain to lie may make it hard to monitor yourself in other areas."
Liars used far more third-person pronouns than truth tellers or omitters. "This is a way of distancing themselves from and avoiding ownership of the lie," Van Swol explains.
Liars spoke in more complex sentences than either omitters or truth tellers.
The researchers also examined when and whether the receivers trusted the allocators—noting instances when receivers voiced doubts about the allocators' statements, and correlating the various linguistic cues with the accuracy of the receivers' suspicions. They also noted instances in which receivers showed no suspicion toward deceivers.
On average, receivers tended to trust the bald-faced liars far more than they trusted the allocators who tried to deceive by omission. In short, relative silence garnered more suspicion than flat-out falsehoods. "It turns out that omission may be a terrible deception strategy," Van Swol says. "In terms of succeeding at the deception, it was more effective to outright lie. It's a more Machiavellian strategy, but it's more successful."
Possible Applications
In the latest phase of their research, the team is investigating the linguistic differences between lying in person and lying via email. Results regarding the latter may be increasingly useful as a larger portion of business is now being conducted via email, and such communications leave a transcript that can be analyzed carefully—and at leisure—by suspicious counterparts. "People detect lies better over the computer than they do face-to-face," Van Swol says.
That said, the researchers are quick to emphasize that linguistic cues are most definitely not a foolproof method of detecting lies, even among those who are trained to look out for them.
"This is early stage research," Malhotra says. "As with any such work, it would be a mistake to take the findings as gospel and apply them too strictly. Rather, the factors we find to be associated with lies and deception are perhaps most useful as warning signs that should simply prompt greater vigilance and further investigation regarding the veracity of the people with whom we are dealing."

Ald. John Arena, l., (45th) blocked crews from continuing work at Lamon and Wilson avenues Monday morning. [Kenji Kerins]
JEFFERSON PARK — Hours after Ald. John Arena (45th) on Monday used their car to block city efforts to close a street, Chicago officials agreed to reopen the road and hold a public meeting about their plans, the alderman said.
Arena said they opposed the project — which they were not notified of before work started this weekend — because it turns over a public street to a billboard company.
City crews tore out the pavement along Wilson Avenue at Lamon Avenue, permanently closing the road in front of the Mayfair Pumping Station to traffic despite Arena's strenuous objections.
Arena — who is often at loggerheads with city departments and Mayor Rahm Emanuel's administration — parked their car Monday morning across Wilson Avenue to stop the work that began over the weekend.
But Arena said late Monday that city crews would "backfill the site and temporarily cover the hole so that the road is open for driving."
Arena said a meeting with city transportation and water officials as well as representatives of the mayor's office Monday afternoon was "fruitful."
In the coming weeks, city officials will "investigate other options for locating the billboard" and study the impact the road's closure will have on traffic in Jefferson Park and what should be done to mitigate it, Arena said.
Before work restarts at the site, a public meeting will take place to allow residents to voice their opinion about where the billboard should be located and whether the road should be closed, Arena said.
"There will be a short pause in work as information is compiled and shared" about the impact of closing Wilson Avenue at Lamon Avenue on traffic, said Mike Claffey, a spokesperson for the Chicago Department of Transportation.
Arena called the decision by City Hall to turn the intersection of Wilson and Lamon avenues into a cul de sac "unilateral and inappropriate."
Heather Cherone says Arena is usually informed before roadwork:

A city spokesperson said closing the street was a safety decision but acknowledged the project would allow a 90-foot-tall electronic billboard to be built in what until last week was the middle of Wilson Avenue, rather than on the front lawn of the pumping station as originally planned.
Arena said Monday morning they could "only assume that I was not informed because [city] officials know that I would have required them to present their plans to the community and assess the negative impact it would have on our residents.”
Arena likened the city's actions to former Mayor Richard M. Daley's decision to tear up the runways at Meigs Field under the cover of night to prevent dissent over their plan to turn that lakefront acreage into a park and nature sanctuary.
The decision to permanently close Wilson Avenue at Lamon Avenue was "designed to enhance safety" near the Mayfair Pumping Station, where there is "a history of excessive speeding," Claffey said.
"These changes will address the speeding problem, eliminate crashes from cars that lose control at the curve from Lamon to Wilson, and reduce the number of trucks that strike the low-clearance viaduct on Wilson," Claffey said.

Claffey did not respond to questions about why the alderman's office or nearby residents were not informed of the plan to close Wilson Avenue permanently at Lamon Avenue.
Arena objected to the billboards, which were approved by the City Council in 2012, and asked city officials to move the billboard planned for Lamon and Wilson. Once built, it would be visible to drivers heading toward O'Hare Airport on the Kennedy Expressway.
"Special interests like the lobbyists behind the digital billboard industry in Chicago should not control the streets in our communities," Arena said.

The closure would make the often-gridlocked intersection of Cicero and Lawrence avenues worse, Arena said.
It would also prevent residents of the townhomes at Lamon and Lawrence avenues from leaving their homes and heading south to the Edens Expressway or Cicero Avenue.
In addition, the garbage trucks that service the entire Northwest Side will be forced to exit the maintenance yard south of the pumping station via Lawrence Avenue, Arena said.
"I have called for work to stop and for [city officials] to come before our community and explain why this plan was implemented without input," Arena said. "Short of a compelling rationale that is supported by the community, I will advocate for the restoration and reopening of this street."
Kristina Grosser Brucker said they were "outraged" that city officials had closed the intersection, which they use at least twice a day to get to and from their home on Lawrence Avenue near Lamon Avenue.
"The traffic on Lawrence has already noticeably increased" since the closure, Brucker said. "Safety is an issue. I'm really upset about the whole thing."
Residents can register their opinion about the closure via an online survey, Brucker said.

Steve Bannon told allies they didn't expect to remain in the Trump White House longer than eight to 12 months—and they were right. Donald Trump's most controversial aide, who was dismissed by White House chief of staff John Kelly, was brought down by the same qualities that endeared them to the president and made them a valued confidant on the campaign trail: their sharp elbows and their intuitive understanding of the populist voters that helped boost Trump to power in November.
But the street-fighting nature Bannon wielded so effectively in 2016 against Hillary Clinton—“an apple polisher who couldn't pass the D.C. bar exam,” they have said—became a liability in the White House, where their colleagues didn't trust them and where Kelly, only weeks into their new role, quickly convinced the president that they were a bad influence. Trump himself, who hates firing people, has not spoken to Bannon personally since their dismissal, according to a White House aide.
Story Continued Below
The proximate cause of Bannon's dismissal was the president's halting response to a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville that left a woman dead. While Trump's senior aides huddled at their golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, urging them forcefully to condemn the agitators—some of who were waving Trump-Pence banners and wearing red “Make America Great Again” hats—Bannon was pushing them in a different direction. The president's most enthusiastic supporters, they told Trump, opposed the removal of Confederate monuments—a cause that became the ostensible pretext for the neo-Nazi rally that spun out of control.
It was a message the president delivered in a topsy-turvy news conference on Tuesday, where Kelly—standing behind Trump—made their displeasure visible to all. “So this week, it is Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?” Bannon emerged later that day to support the president, telling the New York Times that Trump “connects with the American people about their history, culture and traditions.” Trump themselves was pleased—but Bannon's remarks cemented Kelly's sense that they exacerbated the president's worst tendencies.
Bannon's disruptive influence preceded their presence in the West Wing—and it will survive him. From their perch at Breitbart News, where they served as chairperson before joining the Trump campaign in August, Bannon blew open the Republican consensus on trade and immigration. It was Trump who, in their presidential announcement speech, maneuvered to the front of Bannon's parade.
Years earlier, at Breitbart, Bannon had found a passionate audience for what they proudly called “economic nationalism”—the trade protectionism and immigration restrictionism that Trump championed on the campaign trail—and had begun to turn that audience into a political force.

In June 2014, a little-known economics professor from an obscure liberal arts college, David Brat, drove Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor out of politics. It was the first sign that the ideological composition of the Republican Party was changing—even if most party leaders ignored it at the time. Breitbart News, then under Bannon's direction, was the only national news outlet that paid much attention to the race, broadcasting Brat's message to millions of Republicans across the country and turning them into a right-wing folk hero.
Brat homed in on Cantor's support for immigration reform, something Bannon and Breitbart had been doing for months. The site's criticisms—“Cantor Relentless in Push for Amnesty for Illegal Alien Youth,” one headline blared—previewed the nationalist appeals Trump would make on the campaign trail and demonstrated that a sizable portion of the Republican electorate was receptive to them. Months before Brat announced their candidacy, for example, Breitbart pilloried Cantor for attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, the annual gathering of leaders across the academic, business and non-profit sectors, deriding them as a part of the “global superclass” indifferent to the fate of the American middle class.
“The reason that this guy won is quite simple: Middle-class people and working-class people are tired of people like Eric Cantor, who say they're conservative, [but are] selling out their interests every day to crony capitalists,” Bannon said at the time.
The day after Cantor's double-digit defeat, POLITICO reported, “Cantor loss kills immigration reform.” But the Brat-Breitbart nexus also revealed a number of other emerging political realities: that polls could be wildly off (Cantor's pollster had them winning by 34 points); that money doesn't matter all that much (Cantor had raised $5.5 million, Brat just $200,000); and that the political elite is far more fragile than it appears to be.
“One of the things it showed was that David can beat Goliath and you can do it with literally no money—lesson No. 1, money doesn't matter, message does. Lesson No. 2, there's a seething anger against the Republican establishment for not getting anything done,” Bannon told POLITICO in an interview last month.
The other was the brutal effectiveness of Breitbart's smash-mouth politics. The site was unrelenting in its personal attacks not only on Cantor but on all Republican leaders. It was Bannon's protege, Julia Hahn, the precocious University of Chicago graduate who posted photographs of House Speaker Paul Ryan's house surrounded by what Breitbart termed a “tall border fence”—an effort to paint Ryan as a hypocrite for their failure to fund a border wall in an omnibus spending bill. (Bannon would later hire Hahn to work with them in the White House.)
During the presidential campaign, a host of others from Megyn Kelly at Fox News to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and the “donor class” came in for similar treatment. “You don't come to Breitbart for a pat on the head and a warm hug, right? You know you're coming here—it's the fight club,” Bannon told the journalist Reid Cherlin in 2014.
Bannon is an unforgiving opponent but a loyal ally. They insist Trump is “the best orator since William Jennings Bryan,” the 20th-century Midwestern populist, and said they told Trump when they interviewed to be their campaign chief—and again after the Access Hollywood tape was released—that they had a “100 percent chance of winning” if they stuck to nationalistic and populist themes.
If the “fight club” style was effective in a scorched-earth campaign against the political establishment, it has arguably been less effective in the West Wing, though Bannon disputes they brought it there. A flurry of executive orders with Bannon's fingerprints on them, issued in the administration's opening days, backfired. If they were intended to shock Washington into submission, they instead had the effect of subduing Bannon, who also helped to marginalize themselves by boasting too loudly about their influence as the puppet master pulling the president's strings—an act that reportedly enraged the commander in chief.
Bannon's adversaries in the administration also suspected them of being one of the White House's most aggressive leakers, and they got unusually public proof this week when they trash-talked White House economic adviser Gary Cohn in a conversation with the editor of the American Prospect, a small pro-labor magazine. (Bannon apparently thought the conversation was private.) They say that not much has changed since they ran Breitbart, except that they now use the news media they supposedly disdain to spread damaging information about their ideological opponents, from Cohn to national security adviser H.R. McMaster.
Bannon denies those claims and said, instead, that they participate in the debates that play out inside the White House on issues from free trade to foreign policy. Before their departure, they told me the White House “could be a lot more aggressive”—and it was clear they were pushing Trump in that direction. Senior West Wing aides now wonder just how much damage Bannon can do from the outside. They will now have a chance to see whether their aggressive instincts are turned on them.
“I'm a huge believer in the Darwinian argument for ideas, and let the best idea win,” they said.
Astronomy is full of astronomical numbers and if physics tells us anything it is that nothing is obvious. Astonishing facts about the universe are absolutely everywhere and you do not even have to go far from home to find some. Here is a list og 5 mind-blowing facts about the universe.
5 All 6 Billion People On Earth Can Fit Inside An Orange
If I can just be allowed to explain, 99.9% of an atom is just empty space. “Well heck, everyone knows that!”, I hear you cry. As is the case with many facts we tend only to recognise this point in theory, because we cannot really envisage what an atom is like to look at. It is very small.
To put this point into perspective, if you removed all the empty space from the atoms that make up all the humans on the planet then you could fit all 6 billion of us inside a single orange. Come to think of it some unkind people have called me a waste of space and now it's provable!
We can find atoms everywhere, since they are among the fundamental building blocks of the universe. The Sun contains 99.86% of all the mass in the Solar System. The mass of the Sun is approximately 330,000 times greater than that of Earth. It is almost three quarters Hydrogen, whilst most of the remaining mass is Helium.
You see where I'm going with this? That means that the sun is responsible for most of the solar system and we account for no more than you could fit in the palm of your hand. Literally.
Atoms are on the very threshold of super-weirdness. They are stupidly small, yet account for just about everything in existence. One single strand of gossamer thread has about 1 million atoms across its diameter. Its mass, or the 0.1% of it that is actually material, is concentrated at its centre and is something like 1 trillionth of a centimetre across. Its electrons fly around the remainder of the space it occupies at impossible speeds. Even then we tend to rationalise what this means, but if we draw one of those perspective enhancing analogies that help soothe our brains let's say the nucleus of an atom were the size of a football. At that scale the nearest electron would be half a mile (0.8km) away.
It's no use. Atoms are just causing me a headache. What we need is another science to explain everything more rationally that doesn't just cause more headaches. Now, let's see…
Robben Island in South Africa housed political prisoners during apartheid, but Israeli jails hold even more [GALLO/GETTY]
This week, the Russell Tribunal on Palestine will consider the question of whether Israel's practices in the occupied Palestinian territory (OPT) constitute the crime of apartheid within the meaning of the 1973 International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid. This Convention, which has been incorporated into the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, is not confined to apartheid in South Africa. Instead it criminalises, under international law, practices that resemble apartheid.
The Russell Tribunal was initiated in the 1960s by the philosopher Bertrand Russell to examine war crimes committed during the Vietnam War. It has now been revived to consider Israel's violations of international law. It is not a judicial tribunal, but a tribunal comprising reputable jurors from different countries, that seeks to examine whether Israel has violated international criminal law and should be held accountable.
In essence, the Russell Tribunal is a court of international public opinion. It will hear evidence in Cape Town on the scope of the 1973 Apartheid Convention, on apartheid as practiced in South Africa, on Israeli practices in the OPT, particularly the West Bank, and on the question whether these practices so closely resemble those of apartheid as to bring them within the prohibitions of the 1973 Apartheid Convention. The Israeli government has been invited to testify before the tribunal, but, at this stage, has not replied to the invitation. Most of the evidence will inevitably, therefore, be critical of Israel.
Israel cannot be held accountable for its actions by any international tribunal as it refuses to accept the jurisdiction of either the International Court of Justice or the International Criminal Court. The Russell Tribunal seeks to remedy this weakness in the international system of justice by providing for accountability by a court of international opinion. It does not seek to obstruct the peace process. On the contrary, it wishes to promote it. But there can be no peace without justice. This is a basic principle that Richard Goldstone, who has written an op-ed criticising the Russell Tribunal (Israel and the Apartheid Slander, New York Times, October 31, 2011), has devoted much their life to, as prosecutor before the Yugoslavia Tribunal.
Is it true to say, as Richard Goldstone has argued, that there is no basis for likening Israel's occupation of the OPT to that of apartheid? Is it true, as they argue, that such suggestions are "pernicious" and "inaccurate"? Or is there substance in these suggestions?
Of course, the regimes of apartheid and occupation are different. Apartheid South Africa was a state that practiced discrimination against its own people. It sought to fragment the country into white South Africa and black Bantustans. Its security laws were used to brutally suppress opposition to apartheid. Israel, on the other hand, is an occupying power that controls a foreign territory and its people under a regime recognised by international law - belligerent occupation.
However, in practice, there is little difference. Both regimes were/are characterised by discrimination, repression and territorial fragmentation (that is, land seizures).
Israel discriminates against Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in favour of half a million Israeli settlers. Its restrictions on freedom of movement, manifested in countless humiliating checkpoints, resemble the "pass laws" of apartheid. Its destruction of Palestinian homes resemble the destruction of homes belonging to blacks under apartheid's Group Areas Act. The confiscation of Palestinian farms under the pretext of building a security wall brings back similar memories. And so on. Indeed, Israel has gone beyond apartheid South Africa in constructing separate (and unequal) roads for Palestinians and settlers.
Apartheid's security police practiced torture on a large scale. So do the Israeli security forces. There were many political prisoners on Robben Island but there are more Palestinian political prisoners in Israeli jails.
Apartheid South Africa seized the land of blacks for whites. Israel has seized the land of Palestinians for half a million settlers and for the purposes of constructing a security wall within Palestinian territory - both of which are contrary to international law.
Most South Africans who visit the West Bank are struck by the similarities between apartheid and Israel's practices there. There is sufficient evidence for the Russell Tribunal to conduct a legitimate enquiry into the question whether Israel violates the prohibition of apartheid found in the 1973 Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute.
John Dugard is a professor of international law, who authored a comprehensive study of the law of apartheid (Human Rights and the South African Legal Order (1978)) and was for seven years (2001 – 2008) Special Rapporteur to the UN Human Rights Council on the human rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.

The first time I saw it, I was in a friend's boat, passing under the Interstate 74 bridge.
Leaning my head back against the boat seat, I took a long look up at the underbelly of the bridge. That's when I saw the windows.
I wondered about them for a long time, figuring the windows must have something to do with the toll-taking operation that once occupied the center of the I-74. So I poked around, finding lots of pictures of the old toll booths but finding little about what appeared to be offices underneath them.
In late February, I hit pay dirt.
The yellowed news clip was in an envelope in the Quad-City Times' archives, marked, "BRIDGES - INTERSTATE 74" and "early clips."
Sure enough, the story revealed that the offices were built into the piers that support the bridge deck and toll plaza. The old plaza today serves as a parking spot for bridge contractors, the Iowa Department of Transportation and motorists unfortunate enough to have car trouble while crossing.
Directly underneath the mid-span parking lot is a giant space that time forgot. We are talking — get this — 2,800 square feet of offices, restrooms, mechanical storage, built-in safes, even showers.
You can guess what happened next: I set out to land myself and a photographer a tour of the bridge's underbelly.
The office tour
The former toll plaza in the middle of the I-74 bridge is not a safe place for most of us.
Although the speed limit on the bridge is 50 mph, many motorists regard it as more recommendation than rule. Plus, there are no turn lanes into the old plaza, and vehicles in either direction have very little warning when someone attempts to merge in or out.
When IDOT highway maintenance supervisor Clyde Tobey agreed to guide me and a photographer inside the old toll offices, they did so in the safest way possible.
Tobey drove the lead truck — a light bar flashing on top, and we followed in photographer John Schultz's pickup. Behind us was a large orange DOT truck — the kind used for plowing snow. Behind that was another large, orange DOT vehicle with a lighted, flashing arrow mounted on back.
All four vehicles drove from downtown Bettendorf, up I-74 to the Kimberly Road exit. We got off the interstate, then back on, using the distance from the bridge to create a neat, safe row of vehicles, heading back to it.
My first surprise came as we turned onto the plaza. It easily could hold a dozen vehicles.
I'd been paying extra-close attention to the plaza as I crossed the bridge for the month prior to our tour, but it's impossible to accurately gauge its size while driving past. More obvious is the little building on the plaza, which resembles a bus stop. The DOT guys unlocked its only door, revealing a normal-looking stairway that, despite our elevation above the Mississippi River, gave me no pause.
When we hit the last step, it was like we had climbed onto a helicopter and found the space of a cargo ship inside.
Back in time
Two things struck me immediately: It was much warmer than I had expected, given the outdoor temperature lingered at freezing. And the traffic noise above us was so muted, it had no effect on our conversations.
The concrete walls are several feet thick, and windows are everywhere.
The Iowa-bound span of I-74 was built first, opening as a local tollway in 1935. The second span, on the downstream side, was dedicated in 1960. Ten years after the second span was added, the tolls had paid off the construction debt for the twin spans, and the toll booths were cleared away. The remaining plaza and downstairs offices are the only things connecting the twins.
The two offices are nearly identical and are joined by a hallway with windows on either side.
As you've probably already guessed, the main attraction was just beyond those once-mysterious windows. Sixty feet above the river, the lateral dam looks like the bony spine of an enormous alligator. I spun on my heel from window to window, room to room — like a kid deciding which birthday gift to open first.
Tobey and senior equipment operator Ben Petty patiently followed, at the ready with answers to the questions that flowed like the current beneath us.
"We've never opened that vault," Petty said, seeing my eyes fall on a large, rusted door. "We've talked a lot about it. We can only assume it's empty."
Petty said they have followed in the footsteps of Dan Bailey, an IDOT bridge inspector who retired in 2015. During their 35 years as an inspector, Bailey walked every inch of both spans. Besides inspecting it, they took care of it — from painting piers and oiling joints to shoveling by hand the sand/salt mix that collected against the bridge curbs in the winter.
"I tried so many angles to get that thing opened up," Bailey said of the walk-in vault that once held the toll-takers' deposits. "I even went to a locksmith for advice.
"I always said that might be where Jimmy Hoffa ended up."
When they noted the ceiling beam in one office extended into the vault, they even tried to make the argument the vault should be opened, so they could inspect that beam. It didn't work.
It likely will be up to the demolition company that is hired to demolish the bridge in a few years to decide what to do with the vault. (Stand by.)
The offices are mostly barren now, except for a single desk, a pile of retired bridge cables and some steel plates. The plaster that framed one large set of windows got wet and began to crumble, so it was taken down, making one office look like it's under construction. It's not, of course.
"This was actually a very nice place to work, especially when you didn't have 70,000 vehicles a day passing overhead," Tobey said. "You'd have a great view of the eagles in winter."
I could almost picture it — the toll takers coming down after their shift and checking in with the security guard, whose table sat at the entrance to the upstream office. The guard no doubt placed the cash in one of the three wall safes, where it waited to be recounted and placed in the vault.
"The toll superintendent, Dick Bane, and their secretary, Ruby Meyer, faced west in the larger office," Petty said, recounting more of the details they had uncovered in their bridge research.
I pictured Ruby making the coffee and Mr. Bane hanging their hat on a coat rack near their desk. In a black-and-white photo I found in our archives from the 1960 opening of the second span, only one of the 58 people I counted was not wearing a hat. The toll-takers wore them, too; as part of their police-like uniforms.
There were 12 toll-takers, all men, according to a story from the 1960s. It appears from the pipes running up to the ceiling from the office boiler room that the toll booths also were heated. Just below the booths, the offices offered three bathrooms, including one with four stalls and two showers. In the day, there also were tables for lunch breaks and lockers for the men's things, Tobey said.
By November 1971, all signs of the toll booths and related operation were gone. The original set of stairs was sealed shut, and one was left open — for the maintenance people to come and go.
In the years after the closure, a developer made a pitch to the two Departments of Transportation for a restaurant idea, Bailey said. The company wanted to build a restaurant in the plaza, which would have been accessible only by boat. They wanted to add a transient boat dock to a pier below and an elevator to the plaza, bypassing the bridge altogether.
They must not have known about the offices.
'Scared to death of water'
Bailey was only 19 when they went to work in highway maintenance for IDOT in 1980. Two years later, they were spending most of their time crawling all over the I-74 bridge.
Ever wonder about those plastic owls that are lashed to the bridge towers?
"I got those at K&K (Hardware)," the now-57-year-old Davenport man said. "They were designed so the head would sort of bobble in the wind. But it gets very windy up there, and I was afraid the head would blow off and land on the roadway."
So, they bought some fishing line and secured the head to the body. It worked, sort of. While one owl is still doing its job, running off starlings and other bothersome birds, one of the owls vanished.
The decoys did not deter some species, including eagles and hawks. In Bailey's photo album of the bridge are several close-up shots of a red-tailed hawk and its baby in a nest on one of the piers. Asked how they got the shot, Bailey said they became accustomed to working on the bridge while holding on with one hand.
"I carried most of my tools in a five-gallon bucket," they said. "For a long time, we weren't tied off to anything. If I thought I needed to take a look at something, I'd just shimmy up a vertical beam.
"They gave us a belt and lanyard, but the lanyard only opened a quarter inch, and there's not much on that bridge that's small enough to tie that onto. My hands at one time were pretty strong.
"I was there all that time, and no one asked if I could swim. I can't. I'm scared to death of water."
Scared or not, Bailey and other local inspectors would jump from one pier to another, rather than going all the way down to the river and climbing each one separately. Eventually, they put down a couple of boards and tied off a cable, so they could hold onto something. But they were busted by a consulting inspector who reported the unapproved walkway.
"They put it in their report, and we had a catwalk a year later," Bailey said.
Inside the old toll offices, we encountered a couple of holes in the floor that looked like uncovered manholes. Inside, steel ladders delivered bridge maintenance workers to two important places below.
Down the ladders 50 feet are two large concrete spaces called "anchorages." The collection of thick cables that support the bridge are drawn tightly into that room and anchored there. In one of the rooms, a well for water for the boiler, among other things, goes another 27 feet under the river.
Bailey showed pictures of the structures, which have rounded archways that reveal the thickness of the concrete. Inside one anchorage, Bailey left their mark.
Using a paint marker, they wrote their name, along with their title and years of service. Their name joined a few others, including a bridge worker who autographed a wall in 1935.
Back up in the toll offices, Tobey and Petty pointed out some of the bridge lighting outside the windows. And Petty told how the maintenance crew frequently had to climb onto the outer edges of the bridge to replace light bulbs for the channel lights.
"Since we went to LED, we haven't been out there," Petty said.
As we looked out the windows toward Davenport, Tobey pointed out something we hadn't noticed: Small holes in several glass panels.
"Those are bullet holes," they said. "They weren't there a month ago."
I wondered who would do such a thing and considered the bullets, aimed higher, could have hit passing vehicles. Bailey had said something similarly disturbing: "It wasn't unusual for us to be walking the superstructure and have people in cars yelling as they passed, trying to scare us into falling."
They also recalled climbing to the very top of the bridge towers to replace bulbs in the lights that were mounted to warn approaching airplanes.
"When the flight patterns changed, we were told to remove the airplane lights," they said. "After that, it seemed like we had planes coming closer than before."
Their 35-year career on the I-74 bridge is behind him, but Bailey said they think the bridge could continue to function for many more years, if properly maintained. But, as Petty pointed out, "the old girl" soon will be history, and it's probably time. It never was built for so many vehicles, has no pedestrian access and, most importantly, has been deemed unsafe.
For the man who spent their career making sure the bridge was safe, the span took them from sensory overload to total comfort.
"The second or third time I was walking the cables to the top, there was a lot of big debris coming down the river from a flood," they said. "At the same time, there were boats moving upriver, and there were cars and trucks passing on the bridge.
"I had to close my eyes and get my bearings. Later, I didn't even hold onto the cables as I went up.
"I guess I had pretty good balance after a while. In the day, all you really had was balance."
Although they didn't spend much time inside the old toll offices, Bailey always admired them.
"I always thought that would be a pretty cool place to work," they said. "What a place to spend your days."
By Dr. Brian Goldman
For years, doctors have warned Canadians to stop smoking, lose weight and eat the right foods. Now, there's another factor to put your to-do list to better health: Find some company to stave off loneliness.
This is not about people who enjoy solitude by choice -- it's about people who spend long periods without social contact. The effects of that are tangible and they are growing. It's no surprise that loneliness leads to increased rates of depression and alcohol use. More surprising is the impact that social isolation has on your physical well-being. According to a study out of Brigham Young University, loneliness is as damaging to your health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. It is even more damaging to your to body than obesity and diabetes. Lonely people are at greater risk of heart attacks. Loneliness can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease by 64 per cent. And if the subject has cancer, then loneliness can increase the risk that the cancer spreads.
Some of the reasons why loneliness endangers health are obvious. People who are socially isolated don't take medicines as prescribed. They are less likely to eat right and to get moving following surgery - which delays recovery time. Less obvious is the impact of social isolation on the cells of the body. Last year, researchers from the UCLA School of Medicine found that loneliness cranks up genes that cause inflammation and dials down genes that make antibodies that fight off infection. That in turn causes a particular part of our immune system to malfunction. When we are exposed to a germ, our bodies are supposed to send out a type of cell called a monocyte to fight if off. When we're lonely, our bodies send out immature monocytes which do more harm than good.
Chronic loneliness is becoming a public health issue now because it is one of the biggest risk factors for disease. Yet far more attention is put on smoke cessation than helping to alleviate social isolation. As our population ages, the impact of loneliness on our health care system is growing. Older people who live alone are more likely to be hospitalized, even when their medical needs don't require it. That's because they lack the resources at home to provide extra help - and companionship.
And here's the thing. Being lonely doesn't just increase visits to the doctor for medical reasons. For many, a visit to the doctor may be the only social contact they have. A UK study found that a third of patients admitted to the emergency department had seen one other person during the preceding month.
And it's a big health issue in Canada. According to Statistics Canada, as many as 1.4 million elderly Canadians report feeling lonely. Canadian census data showed that about one-quarter of the population aged 65 and up live alone. In Vancouver, residents recently listed social isolation as their most pressing concern. Nearly half of women age 75 and older live alone. It's telling that 72 per cent of Canadians living with Alzheimer's disease are women. It's plausible that loneliness and lack of social contact increase both the risk and severity of dementia. And let's not forget that loneliness is also a problem among landed immigrants and refugees.
There have been calls for front-line health care workers to treat loneliness as a vital sign - that it should be measured along with your blood pressure every time you see a health care provider. Some countries have made it a major health and social priority. Since 2011, the UK's Campaign to End Loneliness has made loneliness a public health priority by sharing research and best practices on dealing with the problem. The UK has pioneered something called befriending services, where a volunteer visits an older person once a week in their own home or by phone to provide friendly conversation and companionship on a regular basis over a long period of time.
In Canada, we have nothing like that on a national scale. We provide lots of resources to people who want to quit tobacco. Even a smidgen of support for lonely people would make a huge difference. But don't wait for a doctor like me to tell you to call someone you know. Just do it.
Tuesday ETRs only come around once in awhile, and this one is special for all the right reasons. First, Kurt Larson of the Toronto Sun joins to talk Toronto FC, who signed Jozy Altidore and Giovinco since the last time the guys gathered around the microphone. That's ... bloody big news, but not a bloody big deal this time around. But is it a good thing for MLS? Will Toronto FC actually make the playoffs?
Altidore is on their way to Southern California, where the US national team is gathered for January camp. It's a welcome break from club life for Bobby Wood. Hear the 1860 Munich man describe how they got frozen out of the club. Could MLS be an option? Sure, says Wood. They just wants to enjoy the game again.
In the mailbag, the guys find out what "Blond Door" is and run through reaction from Red Bulls fans who attended the infamous town hall.
Al Bello/Getty Images CBS aired a taped interview with Ray Lewis before the Super Bowl, and Lewis had an odd answer when asked about the 2000 double-murder that continues to dog their legacy.
Some background: Lewis was found guilty of obstruction of justice in connection with two murders outside an Atlanta nightclub in 2000. SB Nation has a full rundown of the case if you want the complete details.
On CBS, Shannon Sharpe asked Lewis what they would say to the families of the two victims. Lewis talked about the infallibility of God and mentioned that the criminal justice system is broken.
Here's the transcript:
CBS: "What would you like to say to the family?"
LEWIS: "It's simple: God has never made a mistake. That's just who they are, you see. If our system — and this is the sad thing about our system — if our system took the time to really investigate what happened 13 years ago, maybe they would have gotten to the bottom line. But the saddest thing ever is a man looked me in my face and told me, 'We know you didn't do this, but you're going down for it anyway.' To the family: If you knew, if you really knew the way God works, they don't use people who commit anything like that for their glory. No way. It's the total opposite."
Lewis has a tendency to ramble when he's speaking with the media, so this isn't all that unusual for him.
But given the sensitivity of the topic, Lewis probably would have been better served with a simple apology.
GRANTS PASS, Ore. – Millions of krill – a tiny shrimp-like animal that is a cornerstone of the ocean food web – have been washing up on beaches in southern Oregon and Northern California for the past few weeks, and scientists are not sure why.
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration oceanographer Bill Peterson says they may have been blown into the surf by strong winds while mating near the surface, and then been dashed on the beach.
The species is Thysanoessa spinifera. They are about an inch long and live in shallower water along the Continental Shelf. They have been seen in swaths 5 feet wide, stretching for miles on beaches from Bodega Bay, Calif., to Newport, Ore. Some were still alive.
“There has definitely been something going on,” Peterson said. “People have sent us specimens. In both cases, the females had just been fertilized. That suggests they were involved, maybe, in a mating swarm. But we've had a lot of onshore wind the last two weeks. If they were on the surface for some reason and the wind blows them toward the beach and they are trapped in the surf, that is the end of them.”
Or, they may have fallen victim to low levels of oxygen in the water, said Joe Tyburczy, a scientist with California Sea Grant Extension in Eureka. A recent ocean survey showed lower than normal oxygen levels in some locations.
Peterson said low oxygen conditions, known as hypoxia, are a less likely explanation because they normally occur later in the summer.
The mass strandings are unusual, Peterson added. There is no way to tell yet whether this represents a significant threat to a source of food for salmon, rockfish, ling cod and even whales.
Angel Framework Updates — June 2017
Tobe O Blocked Unblock Follow Jun 27, 2017
The Angel framework for server-side Dart programming has officially been in 1.0 since early this year. Angel is still alive and kicking, and underwent several updates throughout June. More features are now available to help you complete projects with minimal headache and a short turnaround time, including:
Hot Reloading
Automatic (De)serialization
A declarative, source-generated PostgreSQL ORM
shelf integration
integration And much more…
Hot Reloading
This month, I published package:angel_hot , which adds hot-reloading capabilities to any Angel server. You can now edit application logic during development without having to manually restart your server after every file change.
The previous approach was to mount directory watchers on the system, and start/stop an entire process on each change. While this method worked, the new API affords much faster startup times, and ensures that the running version of your server is always an instance that is up-to-date.
Projects created with angel init include hot-reload configuration pre-written. Check out the angel-dart/hot repo: https://github.com/angel-dart/hot
Two Boilerplates
It used to be that projects created via angel init contained a tremendous amount of boilerplate logic that was mostly uncommented, and was hard to understand without prior Angel experience. In June, I went through and added comments to the entire project.
In addition, I created a second starter project, boilerplate_light , which is minimal and only contains the most commonly-used Angel packages. When creating a project with angel init , you now have the option to choose between this and the original boilerplate.
See the new boilerplate: https://github.com/angel-dart/boilerplate_light
Static Server, Dynamic Assets, and Ranges
Angel has a complete static server plug-in that supports caching; it now supports serving virtual assets. Version 1.2.0 introduces a simplistic FileTransformer API, somewhat reminiscent of gulp and package:build. There is also functionality available to build assets to disk. This isn't intended to replace something like pub serve , but it can be useful for assets like Stylus stylesheets that must be compiled when requested.
Check it out: https://github.com/angel-dart/static
I was also able to write, test, and publish package:angel_range , which exposes a response handler (ideally used as a response finalizer) that processes Range headers and produces corresponding responses.
Try it out: https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/angel_range
Angel CLI
The Angel CLI no longer checks for updates every time you run it. Instead, run angel update to check for updates, and optionally download a new version.
See its repo: https://github.com/angel-dart/cli
Task Engine Upgrades
In July, Angel's task engine was beefed up, and in addition to being able to schedule recurring and one-off tasks, can now communicate across isolates. You can use the AngelTaskClient to trigger tasks in remote isolates, and when combined with Angel's dependency injection, you can even run tasks (and read their results) within route handlers and hooks. The AngelTaskScheduler will continue to work with Angel's dependency injection system as well.
Find more documentation in its repo: https://github.com/angel-dart/task
Full Shelf Integration
Angel was already able to run shelf handlers (by means of dart:io ), but package:angel_shelf is now a full-fledged shelf adapter. embedShelf can still be used to wrap a handler into an Angel request handler, and will now run faster. supportShelf is a plug-in that patches an Angel instance to inject a shelf.Request into handlers, and allows you to return a shelf.Response from any handler, regardless of whether it is a shelf handler or not.
Check it out: https://github.com/angel-dart/shelf
There's now an example out using the shelf integration to build a private pub server: https://github.com/thosakwe/angel_pub_server
Toggling Services
package:angel_toggle is a new package that allows you to choose between two services, depending on if your application is running in “test mode.” In short, it makes it easy to run against a database in production and development, but against an in-memory service while testing.
Check it out: https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/angel_toggle
Persistent File Services
package:angel_file_service exposes a single JsonFileService class that persists changes to a JSON file on-disk. This is nice for publishing tutorials, because you no longer have to expect end users to have a specific database installed on their system. This might also be useful for developers trying Angel for the first time.
Check it out: https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/angel_file_service
Awesome Angel
July also saw an “awesome list” being born for the Angel framework! Feel free to send a pull request, especially if you have a cool project using the framework!
Check it out: https://github.com/angel-dart/awesome-angel
Codelab
Work has begun on a codelab in which users build a code coverage SaaS with Angel as a backend. Ideally it will be published before the end of July.
You can track its progress here: https://github.com/angel-example/coverage_codelab
Much-Improved Serialization
Angel now ships with a package:source_gen -powered serialization library. package:angel_serialize works with Angel's Model classes, and can replace a TypedService to provide cross-platform (de)serialization. It also supports nested model classes, Lists and Maps, and generates several constructors for your convenience.
Take a peek here: https://github.com/angel-dart/serialize
PostgreSQL ORM
Also under heavy development is package:angel_orm . This is powered by source_gen as well, and generates the following:
Strongly-typed query building (select, insert, etc.)
SQL migration scripts
Angel services (coming soon)
Track its progress here: https://github.com/angel-dart/orm
Coming Soon: In-Memory Caching
Planned for July-August is cherubim , an in-memory cache (a la Memcached) which developers will eventually be able to use to synchronize data, events, and services across multiple instances. cherubim will support isolates, TCP Sockets, WebSockets, and a REST API.
Check it out here, if you're brave: https://github.com/angel-dart/cherubim
Welcome to the film room! Every Thursday, ATQ will take a look back at the week that was. This week, we re-watched the film from Game 1 vs the Southern Utah Thunderbirds at Autzen Stadium. The Willie Taggart era is officially underway.

THE OFFENSE
Quarterback
Justin Herbert looked strong, physically. Their added weight will certainly pay off more down the road but they do look a little bigger on the field this year. They still had the training wheels on last weekend, as Herbert was not looking to audible from the original play calls. It may take a game or two for them to make adjustments with Taggart calling plays. Nevertheless, their golden arm looks better than ever. They were dropping dimes early and often, including a perfect 50-yard pass to Charles Nelson. The game plan vs Southern Utah was very basic and vanilla. The Ducks didn't want to get too complicated in the first contest but also didn't want to leave Nebraska with too much information. The offense recorded 37 first down conversions, including 14 through the air.
Taylor Alie stepped in and showed out during their time on the field. They completed 6-of-6 passes for 74 yards and a rushing touchdown. It didn't take very long to get warm on Saturday, as Alie quickly asserted themselves into the game. The new husband looked like a senior; poised and under control.
Running Back
What else can we say about Royce Freeman? After a brutal junior year, the senior has returned on a mission.  They are bigger and stronger somehow but they still possess the same elite speed. This is as clear a top NFL back as you will see. Freeman has all the tools and then some. They do not wait to be hit, they attack the defense. Southern Utah players could not tackle the workhorse without assistance. Not only was they physically imposing, but their vision allowed them to finesse SU with their shiftiness. They recommitted themselves to the weight room during the offseason and it will continue to pay dividends well into the season. Freeman and their RB group helped UO amass 20 first downs on the ground.
They may be No. 3 on the depth chart, but RB Kani Benoit certainly doesn't play like it. Taggart loves the luxury of having one of the deepest and most-talented backfields in the country. They rushed just seven times on Saturday, but efficiently amassed 107 yards and three scores. Benoit attacks the A and B gaps with a ferociousness that you usually find in defenders. You could not ask for a more-efficient performance. They looked crisp and fast after their conditioning the last month. Kani Benoit was strong but patient through the holes. When they kicked it to the outside, they showed an electric burst. They will be invaluable with TBJ working in the passing game and kick game.
Tony Brooks-James played their part in the running game but made their biggest impact on special teams. The great aspect of a running back on special teams is their vision. They opened the season on a perfectly executed 100-yard kick return TD. They could provide a crucial lift to the return ace Nelson, who could save their energy for the offense. Aside from two lost fumbles, TBJ looked dynamic with their hands on the ball in the passing and running game. They left the game with cramps, but was fine after.
Wide Receiver
Charles Nelson looked great, of course. They finished with five catches for 99 yards and that is pretty much my expectation for them every game this season from the slot.  They are more athletic than every player who lines up against him. Their explosion off the line is almost unfair to those trying to cover him. If they don't catch a pass, it's probably due to pass interference as we saw on Saturday.
The true first-year student Johnny Johnson III made their first collegiate start and looked like a veteran. It took awhile, but JJ3 finally caught their first career collegiate pass from Herbert. After the 2-yard reception, they made an incredible 37-yard snag near the goal line. This kid is ready for stardom. They were consistently blowing by their coverage on the outside. It's only a matter of time before Herbert starts targeting them regularly.
I liked what I saw from Nelson's backup Darrian McNeal. They rushed the rock twice for 17 yards and caught one ball for five yards. Their 5-foot-9 frame is electric and reminds me of a young Charles Nelson. They have great hands, maybe a step below Johnson. If they get to the edge this year, watch out. The sideline is their only defense.
Tight End
Jacob Breeland played a huge role in the first quarter of the game when they came down with two balls for 45 yards and a score. The sophomore illustrated nice hands, sharp route running and most importantly they looked healthy after sporting a cast on their hand throughout fall camp. Breeland will surprise a few defenders with their blocking ability on the run. They can also stay tight for max protection schemes. Nevertheless, it's their receiving ability that sets them apart with sneaky downfield speed and awareness.
Offensive Line
The Ducks rushed the ball 52 times for 366 yards and nine scores on Saturday. Everything you watch on film during a game like this looks perfect. Clearly, it will only get more difficult for Oregon's offensive line but this was a much-needed first performance. Left tackle Tyrell Crosby summed it up perfectly after the game.
“It reminded me of the first two years when we were a dominant o-line. Our run group did a good job.”
Jake Hanson, Shane Lemieux, Calvin Throckmorton and Jake Pisarcik played in unison alongside Crosby. The holes were enormous for the Duck running backs, so it's not hard to imagine why Oregon rushed for 6.7 yards per carry. On more than a few occasions, Duck running backs scored a TD from 10 yards out or further without being touched. It truly is a great sign of respect to the offensive line when the running game looks that good. Last season was the first time in a decade Oregon didn't possess a 1,000-yard rusher. That should change this season. At this rate, it could be done by October. This line has the look of the No. 1 Pac-12 rushing unit in 2017.
THE DEFENSE
Defensive Line
If you watched the game on Saturday, you couldn't help but hear the name Henry Mondeaux. They were all over the field and creating some havoc with a basic game plan. On the other side of the defensive line, Jalen Jelks also showed signs of life. They blocked a field goal attempt, as well. The true freshmen nose tackle rotation between Jordon Scott and Austin Faoliu was interesting. Both seemed to use more energy sprinting on and off the field between plays. Scott just has so much interior strength when you watch him. Faoliu is going to be a force, as well.  They are athletic and has explosive bursts that make you believe they could be dominant at times. Both will need to create pressure with a more expansive game plan.
Linebackers
I'm sure Troy Dye surprised nobody with their performance in Eugene. However, after watching the film again, I was blown away by how active they really are.  They are literally around the ball at the end of every play. It doesn't take a genius to understand why Leavitt trusts them in the middle.  They are always pointing out something or altering teammates.  They are especially beneficial to the freshmen.
Justin Hollins was impressive, but we were expecting that.  They are a freak of nature on the edge and can create havoc by himself. If they can consistently force pressure from the edge, the defense will make some big stops. They have an array of skill moves that they used on Saturday to erase blockers.
Another linebacker that continued their incredible fall was Jonah Moi. They were all over the field on Saturday, but it's their play recognition that is most impressive. At times, it seemed like Moi was in the Southern Utah huddle. They will be an impact player.
Secondary
There was far too much cushion given on the outside. During the Thunderbird opening drive of the season, they breezed down the field for a TD. Taggart said their corners thought ‘Randy Moss' was on the other side. However, UO made adjustments for the second drive and started to play more physically. There were solid moments, but also lapses that made you cringe in fear for what's ahead. The Pac-12 season is coming, so this defense needs a lot of improvement.
Thomas Graham Jr. may have had a (questionable) flag or two thrown against them but they showed great signs of being a future star. They have poise and composure, alongside a handful of physical gifts. They did not look like a true first-year student. In fact, at one moment they tried a subtle push off on the receiver so they could grab the interception. Of course, the referees saw it and flagged it. Yet, you have to be encouraged by their maturity. That is a savvy veteran move for an 18-year-old.
Ugo Amadi started over them but I could see that changing if TG continues to improve. Amadi made a nice play on an interception, alongside a few other stops.  They are a leader with scrappy tackling ability. Amadi embraces the physicality.
Arrion Springs started but struggled at times. The senior improved greatly over the offseason but seemed to revert to some old patterns on Saturday. They gave way too much cushion to the receivers on the outside. Last season, it was a similar story with most of their work being done after the receiver got the first down. A few missed tackles didn't help theirs cause.
Once Deommodore Lenoir entered the game, there was a change. You could see it almost immediately. They have that something special. Aside from being a physical specimen for a true first-year student, he's starting to get it. You can NOT teach most of the gifts they possess. Like I said this summer, give Lenoir some time to get acclimated. They missed the spring and only has the fall camp to work with. Yet, it shouldn't be long before Graham and Lenoir are permanently patrolling the outside.
The safety play was solid, considering it's Oregon's deepest position. Khalil Oliver exited early and was replaced by Billy Gibson and Nick Pickett. Both players jumped off the film to me. It's tough to catch everything live, but the film really illustrates who is doing what they're supposed to. Gibson excelled at the start of camp and they continue to impress their head coach. Their play recognition and change of direction are top notch. They have marvelous hands and athleticism. They have a great feel for the system and Gibson could really be special.
THE SPECIAL TEAMS
This unit was a highlight of the victorious performance. Tony Brooks-James wasted no time getting the bad taste from 2016 out of Oregon's collective mouth. The scary part is TBJ is not the only talent that can return kicks on this team. Brenden Schooler was exceptional in setting up the opening score with a bone-crushing block to free Brooks-James. The scholarship-earning Kaulana Apelu was all over kick coverage as per usual. They made five total tackles and was around the ball on every kickoff and both Oregon punts. Kicker Aidan Schneider kicked off 12 times for a total of five touchbacks, averaging 65.1 yards per boot. They do not try to blast the ball aimlessly into the end zone like most kickers. Instead, Schneider places it around the 1-yard-line and forces the opposition to return it. They made all 11 extra point attempts.
We will break down the Nebraska film next Thursday. After a Duck win, hopefully!

Are ur Saturdays hectic like this!!! To-do list located at search warrant in Cooby. #MurdochLPT3 pic.twitter.com/KdpMbdEYMq — Murdoch Police (@MurdochPol) April 30, 2015
Someone in Western Australia was left red faced -- and possibly with a ruined high -- Thursday after police executing a search warrant on a house in Coolbellup, south of Perth, found a weed smoker's "to do" list.
The unnamed person had apparently written out in careful detail a list of activities to tick off for their coming Saturday, including at the end plans to "go home and get a stick" and then "chop up and get stoned".
Unfortunately for the person concerned, Murdoch police force found the list during the search and posted it on Twitter, leading to guffaws all round on the social media platform.
The force later responded to incredulous queries as to whether the list was indeed genuine.
"Yes, the to-do list was authentic," the force tweeted. "I don't think any of us here could make it up if we tried! #nosenseofhumour."
A US academic has been gang-raped by an armed mob in Papua New Guinea, barely a week after an Australian was killed and their friend sexually assaulted by a group of men.
The academic said they were attacked on Friday while researching birds and the impact of climate change in a remote forest on Karkar Island in Madang province.
Police in the capital Port Moresby confirmed the attack.
"We have taken statements but no arrests have been made yet," a spokesperson said.
"This is a very serious incident."
The 32-year-old was walking along a bush track with their husband and a guide when nine men armed with rifles and knives ambushed them, stripping the husband and guide naked and tying them up, they said.
They then stripped her, bound their hands, cut off their blonde hair to the scalp and gang-raped them for about 20 minutes before something in the forest startled them and they ran away.
The guide managed to break free and the three of them fled naked back to the nearest village, several hours away, they said.
The husband and wife returned to Port Moresby on Saturday, where they were met by a photographer working for AFP who helped them file police reports and organise a flight out of the country.
The case was also reported to the US embassy. A duty officer said on Sunday that the embassy had no comment to offer.
The American's ordeal comes barely a week after Australian Robert Purdy, 62, was shot dead at Mount Hagen, in PNG's Western Highlands, and a woman they were with, reportedly from the Philippines, was gang-raped by 10 armed men.
Violence against women is endemic in Papua New Guinea, but it is rare for a white woman to be targeted, and the academic said they wanted to tell their story to shine a light on the issue.
"This story should not come out because I am white," said the woman, who was on their fifth visit to the country since 2010, often staying for up to four months to conduct research.
"It should come out in hopes that it empowers Papua New Guinean women to stand up and say no more violence against women in this country.
"I hope my story can make a change."
PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill condemned that attack as the "cowardly act of animals".
"This kind of behaviour totally undermines our efforts to make our country a safe destination for investment and tourists," they said.
"We cannot allow the entire nation to suffer because of the behaviour of one or two sick people."
The incidents follow a series of gruesome murders, including a 20-year-old mother who was accused of witchcraft, stripped and burned alive in front of a crowd at a market near Mount Hagen in February.
Earlier this month, an elderly woman was beheaded after being accused of sorcery.
Ghoulish Goodwill Goodies!
A few readers sent word that their local Goodwill stores had gone all out for Halloween, so of course, I wanted in on the fun.
Problem is, we don't have a “local” Goodwill. I was tempted to drive out to the fantastic store we found back in May, but that much highway on Labor Day weekend sounded like a lotta traffic. We instead chose a closer store, only about ten minutes into Jersey. Though my GPS was under the impression that its address did not exist, it was so worth the navigational hassle. As a final FYI, this paragraph flows nicer if you read it in a staggered robot voice.
Halloween was ALL OVER this Goodwill. Entire aisles full of still-packaged and apparently-unused costumes were everywhere we turned, and for the first few moments, I was floating.
Then I got a look at the prices.
Oof. That was a spirit killer. I thought I'd landed in Halloween Valhalla, but it was really just another overpriced costume shop, somehow masquerading as a Goodwill. You know those “bagged” costumes that come with a mask and a cheap bodysuit? They wanted as much as 30 bucks for some of them. I suppose the prices weren't outrageous for unused costumes, but when I go to a Goodwill store, I expect to treat my potential purchases with the same apathetic budgeting that one might employ in Dollar Tree. I don't want angels and devils arguing across my shoulders. Not at Goodwill.
But it wasn't all bad. Once we got past the costumes, the “junk shelves” had many cheaper treasures to offer. (Not dirt cheap and still not what I'd call “thrift store prices,” but at least I could consider purchasing these items without the demonic God of Guilt breathing fire up my ass. Fuck them and their horns, y'know?)
Now, when you look at the above photo, and I tell you that that was barely a fourth of their Halloween “junk shelf” items, you might think that I hit the jackpot. Actually, I really needed to hunt for the goodies. Between the prices and the fact that so much of it was the same stuff you'd find at any party store, the mosaic meant a lot less when you looked at the pieces individually.
But that just made “the dig” more fun. Whenever I found something that was worth buying and affordable, I tested my ability to scream Daniel Bryan's catchphrase in alternate languages. By the time I got to “Hanji hanji hanji,” I was starting to get looks.
Here are the five ghoulish goodies I went home with!
#1: Vintage McDonald's McBoo Pail!
Price: $.99
Oui oui oui! This was the entire reason I went there. In the few photos people sent in from their own Goodwills, there always seemed to be a McBoo pail present. I prayed that the phenomenon would continue for me, and it did!
If you're unfamiliar with McBoo pails, McDonald's starting giving them away in the mid ‘80s. Most people anywhere near my age have so many awesome memories tied to them. Ostensibly meant to be used as trick-or-treat buckets, the McBoo family (mine is called “McWitch”) ultimately took much larger roles in our lives. They were perfect for everything from LEGO bricks to Crayola crayons, and so they became the only Halloween “decorations” that stayed out all year. (When I look at them, I don't think of the Halloweens of my childhood. I just think of childhood in general. Does that make sense?)
McWitch is dated “1986,” and I can only imagine what they might've endured in the 25 years before I found them She's still smiling, if that's a clue.
PS: In another “I'm old” moment, I'll confess that I first wrote about these pails almost ten freakin' years ago. Get off my lawn.
#2: Ninja Star Wound
Price: $2.99
Buying this was bittersweet, because the “2.99” price tag was obviously a holdover from the original retail store. That didn't keep Mrs. Goodwill from ringing it up at that price. Three bucks doesn't sound like a lot, but at Goodwill, it's akin to ordering the surf ‘n turf.
I wasn't interested in it for any practical reason. I just love the way Halloween “scar makeup” packages look. The assorted graphics are always so admirably contradictory. Here we have a boy bordering on death by way of a thrown ninja star, and he's over a background that might be better suited to Manfredi Hyundai's 4th of July commercial.
What turned this into a must-buy was the clarification on the lower right. “INCLUDES: One Ninja Star Wound with netting.” Only a moron would leave words like that behind.
#3: Troll Mask
Price: $1.99
This may have been the oldest “costume item” in the whole store. Back when Norfin Trolls were chic and exciting, there were a bazillion of these masks floating around, always with the same stupid face, but with a variety of Troll hair colors.
Goodwill had two of them. The other had hot pink hair. I don't know why I didn't pick that one, since I'd already covered “green” with my McWitch pail. I'm going to spend the rest of the day looking up hilarious “EPIC FAIL” image macros.
The half-mask keeps you from suffocating, but it also dampens the visual impact. If you're going to wear this, keeping your true identity secret is an absolute prerequisite. I guess what I'm saying is… don't go chasing old rubber Troll masks unless you have one of those jawlines that blends in.
#4: Random Monster Head
Price: $.99
It's a three-inch shrunken head, which, at one point, had light-up eyes and made noise. Not anymore, though. This disembodied head offers nothing beyond being a disembodied head.
I bought it because I felt bad for it. Even when surrounded by other Goodwill donations, it still seemed so frail and insignificant. There were ten thousand dusty things in that store, but this was the only one that clearly needed me. It helped that they have such a pleading face, too. And are those blue things supposed to be tears?
Well played, Hooded Demon Head. You tugged on all the right strings.
#5: COLORIZED Night of the Living Dead VHS
Price: $.99
Pretty major score, IMO. It's not worth anything, but it was just such an odd movie to find on a VHS rack that was otherwise filled with Dora, Dora and more Dora.
From 1987, it's the special COLORIZED version of Night of the Living Dead. I'm assuming that the colorization process has been improved again and again over the years, but this is the ‘80s version. The movie's colorization looked like a goofy Tim Burton style choice. Which is actually kind of great.
UPDATE: And here's the part where you'll swear I'm making things up.
I promise you, I'm not.
I've got the stuff from Goodwill all over my desk as I write this, in case I need to check a date or whatever. I just slid this video out of its box, hoping to discover a special edition “colorized” label. Instead, I found this:
I've been had! Black Triangle's Penthouse Passions, from 1985? The fuck? I bought porn from Goodwill?!
This is fantastic. Had I noticed this earlier, I wouldn't have wasted so much time writing about troll masks and McDonald's freebies. This is where the action is. Holy shit.
So, piecing this together, I guess we had a case of some wayward teen trying to shield their “material” from prying parents. I love this so unbelievably much. I'm now the proud owner of a thirty-year-old dirty secret.
That's worth so much more than a dollar.
The New Paper did an amazing report on the decade long struggle NUS have had with sexualised camp games. The report concluded that a decade on, nothing much had changed, if anything, things had gotten worse.
Some of the activities include re-enacting rape scenes and coming up with cheers that insinuated rape.
There have been fingers pointed at the administration for not enacting change, but as it turns out, the propensity for structural inertia is reflected in some students as well, who not only resists reforms but often put down those who complain about the situation
Here are some of the responses that were posted on NUS Whispers, a confession site for NUS students to post anonymously.
Relax
Chill out, it's just chanting about rape.
Bullying is just a fact of life
One post suggests that those who feel uncomfortable only have themselves to blame.
Those who complain are narrow-minded.
The post also brought up tradition, and the need to adhere to it as a reason not to enact changes, an attitude some might call narrow-minded.
Here, take this incredibly weird analogy
Not satisfied with confronting the complainers on a literal level, some resorted to making up perplexing analogies to put their point across.
Now there are a lot of things wrong with this analogy, so we've come up with a better one.
“You go to a hawker center and there's a stall selling chicken rice. You don't like to eat chicken rice so you don't buy it.
The stall proceeds to mock you for being too traditional – ‘What? You too conservative to try chicken rice ah?'
You then have to hang around the stall for 4 to 5 years, all the while knowing that just because you didn't like chicken rice, they are going to treat you somewhat differently for the duration of your studies hawker centre stay.
So, in a bid to escape the fate, you have to eat chicken rice from the incredibly outgoing chicken rice stall, even if it makes you feel horrible afterwards.”
I hope this little analogy can help my less-sensitive friends understand the situation better. Peace.
Why the need for all these rape innuendos
One post perfectly sums up the problem with this apparent need for rape jokes, scenes and suggestive cheers.

While there are a few hardware-only funds and many funds will invest in drones if backed into a corner, Drone.VC looks to be the first fund that caters specifically to the robo set. Created by founder of Hacker Dojo, David Weekly, the fund is looking for backers to its syndicate on Angel List.
Weekly is already looking at some nice startups in Mexico, Singapore, and California and is heading to DroneCon in Boulder, Colo. to look for more.
They got hooked on drones when they ran their first autonomous mission with their own 3DRobotics IRIS quadcopter.
“I noticed a number of my friends starting to tinker with drones in the past few months – actually a lot of people who were webbed 2.0 entrepreneurs have gotten drones and started playing with them, so I was curious what all the fuss was all about,” they said. “The hairs on my arms tingled when we sent the drone on its first fully autonomous mission. Watching this thing I had just wirelessly commanded take off and perform a mission while streaming realtime telemetry to my laptop was really a 21st century moment, like seeing a self-driving car on the freeway.”
Weekly sees the drone market as unique in that it is up-and-coming and very focused. Rather than looking at all robotics, they have focused on one of the most popular spaces in the market right now, commercial and personal flying drones.
BI estimates that commercial drone sales will rise to $12 billion over the next decade, a slow and steady rise that should continue as more and more users understand why they want a flying camera platform.
“This space is going to be enormous in just a few years as applications in agriculture, real estate, small-object delivery (especially in developing markets), videography, and construction abound,” they said. “I can't wait to be surprised by the industries these things are useful for.”
Weekly said the fund wouldn't invest in military or armored drones, an interesting distinction considering that, until very recently, the only drones available were military grade. It's clear that the consumerization of robots has just begun.

Citing bullying and isolation, a group of United Church ministers has teamed up with Canada's largest private-­sector union to create Unifaith, the nation's first union for clergy.
“Support is pretty widely based across the entire country,” said Rev. Robin Wardlaw, the newly-elected union chapter president, on Wednesday.
Short of the support needed to be certified as the bargaining agent for ministers in Canada's largest Protestant denomination, Unifaith was formed as a “community chapter” within Unifor.
Membership is open to all workers and retirees in the church, student ministers and immediate family members.
The objective is to build enough support to hold a certification vote and negotiate collective agreements with the church, Wardlaw said.
Clergy reaction has varied, they said.
“Someone who has been lucky so far and has not had a stressful situation is apt to be a little less supportive than someone who has been through difficulties,” they said.
On its website, unifaith.ca, the union says United Church ministers will not strike.
The bylaw adopted for Unifaith says the union will work to give members a collective voice and advocate for job security and in the face of disciplinary procedures, and push for the right to negotiate a collective agreement.
Professional development is another key objective, Wardlaw said.
“Our hope is this will be a professional organization like many other professional organizations dedicated to improving the standards of our vocation,” they said.
The formation of a union comes amid unprecedented upheaval in the United Church, with the closing, on average, of one church a week. That pressure has been tough on ministers and congregations, leading to problems such as bullying, said Rev. Jim Evans of New Vision Community Church in St. Thomas.
“Somebody once said to me: ‘You can't kick God, but you can certainly turn to God's representative and kick her,' ” said Evans, who served as interim president of the union chapter.
Evans said the wider church is aware of issues of workplace violence and harassment and has made efforts to address them. But ministers, often working in isolation, need more support than the church has provided.
“It reaches a point where we need somebody who is going to walk with us when things get really tough,” they said.
Nora Sanders, general secretary of the United Church of Canada, said Wednesday the church has little information about the new union chapter.
“We are interested in hearing the concerns of ministers and figuring out how best to deal with them,” Sanders said.
As for problems of ministers isolated and bullied, they said the church has made efforts to support both the people locally trying to manage things and the minister, they said.
“Is it perfect? Probably not. We are talking about human situations,” they said.
Unionizing the church could be complicated.
For one, it is not clear who employs ministers, the congregation or the national church.
Wardlaw said the act of Parliament that created the United Church in 1925 doesn't answer the question, but legal advice union organizers received points to the national church.

COMMUNITY CHAPTERS
Joshua Caplan of Gateway Pundit reports:
On a flight from Boston to Los Angeles, Hollywood star and firebrand conservative James Woods witnessed what the FBI believes was a ‘dry-run' for the 9/11 attacks. According to Reuters, Woods “tipped off the FBI about their encounter with four suspicious airline passengers a month before last Tuesday's attacks on America.”
ABC News reported:
On a flight from Boston to Los Angeles about a month ago, Woods observed four men of apparent Middle Eastern origin acting so oddly that they reported them to the flight attendants and authorities on the ground when they landed. The Oscar-nominated actor told the FBI last week that they were alone in first class with the four men and noticed during the entire cross-country flight that none of them had anything to eat or drink, nor did they read, sleep, or appear to make themselves comfortable. They sat erect in their seats and stared straight ahead, saying nothing to flight attendants and speaking to each other only in inaudible tones. […]The flight now appears to have been a dry run for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, in which hijackers seized and crashed four commercial planes, including one flying the same Boston-to-Los Angeles route. The day after the terrorists crashed the planes into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a field in western Pennsylvania, Woods called the FBI to report their eerie experience.
Sixteen years ago today the US came under attack by radical Islam. 2,997 people were murdered in a series of coordinated attacks by the Islamic group Al-Qaeda. The Twin Towers at the World Trade Center were destroyed in the attacks.
Today One World Trade Center stands in its place.
And today America has a populist president who puts Americans first.
On Monday September 11, 2017, President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump honored those lost on 9-11 with a moment of silence at the White House.

While you were growing up, did you ever watch the animated story of Ichabod Crane? Were you enchanted – and also terrified – hearing these old folk tales of New England?
In an era of modern day slasher movies, technological horror, and a zombie-themed version of everything, it's easy to forget that America has some great old legends that were created before Stephen King and George Romero. Fortunately, Greater Than Games is here to help bring back that old America charm. Legends Of Sleepy Hollow is a board game made to give you a story-filled experience, and at first look, it doesn't disappoint.
Playing With History And Folklore
Legends of Sleepy Hollow puts you in the shoes of four heroes that are determined to discover what exactly has happened to Ichabod Crane. At the end of the original Washington Irving short story, Ichabod was never actually killed: only their hat was found, next to a smashed pumpkin. The board game picks up the tale at this point – it decides that monsters such as the Headless Horsemen could be real, along with other terrors that the deep woods might hide.
This is a game based around story, and that is one of the greatest selling points of Sleepy Hollow. Greater Than Games is promoting that the boxed game comes with eight chapters, or individual games. As you play through the game as this band of four heroes, you will progress through the chapters to fight greater foes and more intricate mechanics.
legends_of_sleepy_hollow_kickstarter_2.jpeg The four heroes: Jeramiah the Undertaker, Matthias the War Veteran, Elijah the Priest, and Emily Van Winkle the Tanner
We were sent a prototype, which included a full playthrough of the first chapter, including the story points. This first game did a great job letting us know what is to expect in terms of tone. Creeping monsters, made of sentient dead trees and pumpkin heads, shambling into a schoolhouse slowly being devoured by the dark wood itself; it had a spooky charm, letting you enjoy the darker tone without becoming outright horror. The clips of story that you read outloud, both at the start of the game, as you completed objectives, then managed victory, were meant to engross you to find out more as this first chapter closed.
Mixing Mood With Mechanics
A round in Legends of Sleepy Hollow is played by allocating an action (interacting with the environment, resting, or attacking) to each of the four heroes, as well as letting them move. Then, the game board gives the monsters to respond according to the chapter you are playing. It's a simple system, but one that comes with a lot of fun adjustments. Greater Than Games works hard to make their game mechanics mix well with the theme and atmosphere they are trying to create; Sleepy Hollow is no exception.
ichabod_crane_game.jpg Each chapter has the potential to give you entirely different monster actions, different monsters to spawn, or even which characters they might try to attack first in the future.
The first thing to keep in mind is how each chapter has the potential to change how the monsters act fundamentally. As shown above, the foes that slowly inhabited and crept into the schoolhouse we were investigating worked in a particular way: one round they would move and attack, and then the next they would also spawn new ones, as determined by dice rolls and points of access on the map. It gave us as heroes a chance to try and finish off what was nearby, but every other round, more could appear. Our ranged expert, Emily Van Winkle, got a nasty bite as a monster spawned on top of her, attacking before we could even react. From what we saw, each chapter can have its own spawn pool and its own actions to prioritize.
The second way Sleepy Hollow makes actions more interesting is in the heroes: once you play an action on a particular slot, you can no longer use that action until you run out of spaces to place tokens, and then your choices reset again. Our four player game found out this is why Fear is interested in the game: being attacked, even if you survive it, will force fake action tokens into your pool that you have to use. They force characters to skip valuable actions, unless you use the rest actions (Or the priest) effectively.
This doesn't keep in mind how each chapter might have a different set of objectives to juggle. The first chapter had us finding documents, which could either spawn more creatures or give us an item to use. After bringing the documents to a location, we triggered the real end goal of that game by reading a story card, and opening an envelope. In this way, story chapters have an aspect to them reminiscent of Pandemic: Legacy, but there is no ripping up of cards or permanent changes to the board itself. Instead, it calls comes down to the revealing of story, and new objectives. By the end of our play through, I was genuinely impressed with how well Sleepy Hollow seems to add new content and challenges, and will continue to do so into later chapters.
Legends Of Sleepy Hollow Promises A Fun Tale And A Great Game
Something that has blown my mind thinking about this is how over the course of eight chapters, there will be seven distinct maps that you will play on. By the end of our chapter one game attempts, we became familiar with the Schoolhouse and ways to use the map well. Now, because new boards will always be introduced, we have to stay on our toes: the capability for new surprises is renewed. Legacy style games often keep things fresh by constantly adding or removing things from one permanent board, but this is the first game I've played which changes the board altogether.
legends_of_sleepy_hollow_kickstarter_4.jpg This game combines my love of Legacy games revealing details over time, alongside miniatures combat. Keep in mind, the final game will have full miniatures, not pop-up characters.
While this is a Kickstarter, we did have a chance to play through the entirety of chapter 1, including the reveal of new story, and how your characters will have a chance to level up and improve between episodes. I can safely say that the mechanically, Legends of Sleepy Hollow is not only sound, but has a lot of potential to grow as you complete chapters. The Kickstarter promises even more surprises to come, with divergent paths and more intricately challenging scenarios. It was truly fun to play, and I can imagine having a close group of friends marathoning this game for days.
If there is one cautionary note I would add, it is about price. The price during the Kickstarter campaign will $69, but a full release will instead be a whopping $100. That is a large amount to pay, especially if some interested gamers equate eight chapters to just eight (successful) games. However, it appears that Greater Than Games is approaching this game release as one meant to be a showstopper: the final characters will be cast in plastic miniatures with HP counters, the player boards will have recesses for keeping your cards and action points in place, and the box itself has been designed to open like a treasure chest!
Is this a Kickstarter worth backing? If you are a fan of story and plot, my answer would be a solid yes. The game is essentially promising to be a guided set of dungeon crawls, allowing you and your friends to focus on the playing of the actual game and having fun in the process. If you are a fan of games like Dungeons and Dragons, or have played story/legacy board games before, this is a game that is worth your attention and money. In addition, Greater Than Games has a history of completing Kickstarters well, thanks to their most recent success, Spirit Island.
If you are a fan of jumping into games that spin their own tales, then I heartily suggest you take a look at the Kickstarter while it lasts: you have until November 10th to decide. For myself, I believe Legends of Sleepy Hollow has the potential to be one of the great story-based games in 2018, and you can expect me to eagerly be awaiting a copy to review next year.
Finally some clarity about the Russian plans about Syria
This column was written for the Unz Review: http://www.unz.com/tsaker/finally-some-clarity-about-the-russian-plans-in-syria/
A lot has happened in the last few hours. Putin spoke at the UN, the Russian Parliament has approved the use of Russian military forces in Syria and Sergei Ivanov has given the Russian media a detailed explanation for the reasons which made the Kremlin request such an authorization. The picture has finally become much clearer.
What will not happen:
There will be no “ Most Anticipated Showdown in Recent History ”: no Russian ground operation, no Russian imposition of a no-fly zone (especially not against the US or its allies!), no MiG-31s, no Russian Airborne Forces, no Russian tanks on the frontlines, no Russian SSBN (nuclear weapons carrying) submarines and probably no significant Russians military presence around Damascus. In fact, there will be no Russian unilateral military operation of any kind. All that nonsense can now finally be put to rest.
What will happen:
The Russian military operation will be legal on all levels: the Russians have received a formal request for military assistance from the Syrian government, the Russian Parliament has given its authorization, and Russia will seek a UN Security Council authorization. The Russian military operation will be officially limited to air operations including bombings and close air support. The main hub of the Russian operation will be in Latakia. Crucially, Russia will act as a part of a broad coalition.
It would be a mistake to focus primarily on what will happen next. I would argue that what has already happened is far more significant.
What has already happened:
Putin has basically forced the USA to accept the Russian plan. Kerry has told CNN that the US policy for Syria will be “adjusted” – in other words the US is giving up on the notion of ousting Assad, officially temporarily. NATO has declared that it would welcome a positive role for Russia in Syria. The Pentagon has followed the Israeli example and has decided to open a special communications channel to coordinate Russian and US operations. Considering the above, I suppose that the US will give its Bulgarian colony the order to stop closing its airspace to Russian aircraft.
Finally, I will make some guesses as to what might happen next.
What might also happen:
First, I would not be surprised if the Russians did declare that it was their standard operating procedure to protect their military installations with air defense systems. And then would finally bring in their S-300s (I am aware of rumors that the S-300s are already there, but I have seen no confirmation so far). I would expect the Israelis to feel particularly miserable about that, and I would not be surprised if the Russians offered guarantees that these systems would remain exclusively under Russian control. What is already certain is that Netanyahu did fly to Moscow to address issues of Russian-Israeli is not “cooperation” then at least “non-interference”. I would add here that Moscow has no hostile plans towards Israel whatsoever and that, by all accounts, the Russians and Israeli officials get along famously, if only because both sides are smart and pragmatists (they don't need a love fest, they need responsible behavior).
Second, the official Russian military presence in Syria will give the Russians the perfect cover for all sorts of covert efforts including the delivery of equipment, joint intelligence operations and even direct action missions. I don't think that this will be a major part of the Russian effort, but now the option is definitely here.
Third, and this is admittedly 100% my own speculations, I believe that the entire Russian military effort will be a cover for something else: a larger Iranian and Hezbollah involvement. Why? For one thing, there is only that much any air operation can achieve. There is no reason to assume that a very small Russian Air Force contingent will significantly change the course of the war. The total failure of the NATO airforces over Kosovo has proven that air operations are, by themselves, of very limited capability, and, unlike the NATO in Kosovo, Russia will send a rather small contingent of aircraft. However, the presence of the Russian Air Force in the Syrian skies could conveniently “explain away” any sudden military reversals for Daesh, especially if the real reason for such reversals would be a beefed up Iranian intervention. Again, I have absolutely no information confirming any of that, but I personally expect a sharp rise in the Iranian and Hezbollah efforts to bush back Daesh.
Evaluation:
In purely military terms this is a rather minor development. Yes, the Syrian Air Force badly needs some modernization (the fact that they are using helicopter-dropped 500kg barrel bombs is a proof that they don't have enough aircraft to deliver guided or even unguided 500kg aerial bombs) and the Russians will be bringing some very capable aircraft (SU-24s and SU-25s for sure, and in some specific cases they could even use Tu-22M3s and SU-34s). But this will not be a game changer. Politically, however, this marks yet another triumph for Vladimir Putin who has forced the US Empire to renounce its plans to overthrow Assad. Because, and make no mistake here, the Russians are now there to stay: a limited Russian military presence will now turn into a major Russian political commitment. Furthermore, not only will Tartus continue to serve a fairly limited but not irrelevant role for the Russian Navy, the airbase in Latakia will become a hub of Russian military operations and, in effect, a forward operating base for the Black Sea Fleet.
Conclusion: a game changer after all?
Yes. But not because of some Russian military move. Consider this: for the United States the main purpose of Daesh was to overthrow Assad. Now that the US is declaring that they “don't plan to arm the Syrian rebels at the moment” and that Assad will not be overthrown, the utility of Daesh to the AngloZionist Empire has just taken a major hit. If the Empire decides that Daesh has outlived its utility and that it has now turned into a liability, then the days of Daesh are counted.
Of course, I am under no illusions about any real change of heart in the imperial “deep state”. What we see now is just a tactical adaptation to a situation which the US could not control, not a deep strategic shift. The rabid russophobes in the West are still out there (albeit some have left in disgust ) and they will now have the chance to blame Russia for anything and everything in Syria, especially if something goes really wrong. Yes, Putin has just won another major victory against the Empire (where are those who claimed that Russia had “sold out” Syria?!), but now Russia will have to manage this potentially “dangerous victory”.

A pulsar, known as SXP 1062, is seen to the right, the bright white spot with the diffuse blue emission. (NASA/CXC/Univ. of Potsdam/L. Oskinova et al.)
Pulsars: Why We May Be Overlooking Extraterrestrial Beacons
Considering the vastness of space, the immensity of the cosmos we search, it seems unlikely that we would ever find evidence of extraterrestrial life in the form of beacons or radio messages.
However, perhaps that is not the case at all, maybe the messages from aliens are frequent and we are just not looking in the right part of the sky at the proper time. Moreover, perhaps we are not detecting alien signals because we are misinterpreting them.

The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute, which operates out of Mountain View, Calif., is a world leader in the search for intelligent life in the cosmos. SETI takes into account a variety of efforts aimed at exploring this field. But, its main efforts currently involve the use of the Allen Telescope Array, which began monitoring radio waves from the cosmos in October 2007.
So far, no definitive intelligent signals have been detected by SETI. Astrophysicist Gregory Benford at the University of California–Irvine (UCI), along with their brother and colleague physicist James Benford, believe that it is not necessarily the tools, but rather the methodology that causes the search to remain fruitless.
The brothers—together with James's son, Dominic, a NASA scientist, and other supporting scientists—suggest SETI set its receivers to detect direct broadcast beacons, instead of the narrow band radiation SETI is currently investigating.
“Our grandfather used to say, ‘Talk is cheap, but whiskey costs money,'” James Benford said, according to UCI News. “Broadcasting is expensive, and transmitting signals across light-years would require considerable resources.”
An advanced civilization interested in sending signals out into space may be as concerned about costs, limiting waste, and optimizing efficiency as we are on Earth.
In other words, an advanced civilization interested in sending signals out into space may be as concerned about costs, limiting waste, and optimizing efficiency as we are on Earth. The brothers postulated that these alien signals would not be continuous and broadcast in all directions, but rather pulsed and narrow, and may be broadband in the 1-10 gigahertz range. The Benfords' work appeared in the journal Astrobiology in June 2010.
Additionally, the brothers suggest looking toward the center of the Milky Way where the great majority of the galaxy's stars reside.
“The stars there are a billion years older than our sun, which suggests a greater possibility of contact with an advanced civilization than does pointing SETI receivers outward to the newer and less crowded edge of our galaxy,” Gregory Benford said , according to UCI News.
Of course, looking in the right place is only part of the problem.
A signal from an alien civilization might be rather fleeting. Thus, if we're not looking at the right point at the right time, we could very well miss the signal. Moreover, even when we do catch a glimpse of temporary astral phenomena, they are often instantly assumed to be natural occurrences.
Possibly, an intelligent transmission would pulsate to conserve energy, but would also need the proper amplitude of frequency to attract other intelligent life looking for that signal.
According to the brothers, alien signals could be sweeping the skies in a regular pattern much like a lighthouse. Depending on the size of the beam and the scan rate, days could pass between flashes.
“We should learn how to identify any such beacons,” they told Discovery News.
Pulsars are the rotating remnants of stars a few times more massive than our own sun. They rotate very fast and emit bursts of radiation along their magnetic field lines. Alien beacons using the “lighthouse” method of transmission could look very similar to the patterns emitted by these stars.
The first pulsar observed was named LGM-1, which stands for “little green men.”
Possibly, an intelligent transmission would pulsate to conserve energy, but would also need the proper amplitude of frequency to attract other intelligent life looking for that signal. Pulsars were discovered by Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Antony Hewis in 1967. The first pulsar observed was named LGM-1, which stands for “little green men.” LGM-1 peaked every 1.33 seconds, according to Universe Today, and early scientists thought it might be evidence for extraterrestrial communication.
Perhaps the best candidates for alien signals are non-repeating pulsar-like signals, according to the brothers. One example would be PSR J1928+15, which pulsed for two minutes in 2005 then suddenly stopped. They believe this could be an example of a scanning E.T. beacon, according to Discovery News, as the beam “scanned” past the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico with the first and third pulses at the edge of the beam's width.
The source of the pulse was somewhere in the neighborhood of 26,000 light years away, toward the galactic core, and was transmitted at 190,000 terawatts (more than 10,000 times the energy demands of our entire human civilization). Some scientists have said that the pulse may not have been a pulsar, but rather may have been the result of an asteroid falling into the star, disturbing its magnetic field.
There are still more avenues to consider. For example, the talk of alien beacons thus far assumes an advanced alien civilization would use radio transmission and not another form of communication above and beyond our level of understanding.

Conversely, a civilization at or around our same level of sophistication might indeed use a transmission method such as the lighthouse method postulated by the Benford brothers. However, as it takes an equal number of light years to send a response, it's likely these possible beacons, if they come from intelligent life, are simply that—beacons. Meaning, they contain no specific messages, but simply serve as indicators saying, “We are here.”
Also up for debate is the question of how many intelligent extraterrestrial life forms may exist in our galaxy and at what level of technological civilization they may have attained. With the vast number of stars in our own galaxy (about 200 billion, according to NASA), the possibilities are vast and our knowledge limited. Until contact is made with these civilizations, if they do indeed exist, we're left searching and guessing.

You are so not ready for this.
A new piece of medical equipment is being tested right now called the Pedisedate. Basically, it is a headset that is placed on a child before they are admitted to surgery. The device connects to a Game Boy or portable CD player (yup, not a Nintendo DS or iPod -- apparently the Pedisedate also transports you to 1996) and a snorkel-like piece swings forward and is placed over the child's nose. As the kid plays videogames or listens to music, nitrous oxide, an anesthetic gas, is emitted through the snorkel and puts the child to sleep.
Nope, I am not joking.
While I think its intentions are noble (making kids comfortable during surgery is a wonderful thing) the concept of the Pedisedate is absolutely ridiculous.
But you think just reading about this is what is so out of control? Oh, my friends, you would be wrong. Please hit the jump and check out the promotional video.
Seriously, you are not ready.

Earlier in the week it looked like Islam Feruz was heading for a spell at Cardiff City, but after taking an extensive look at the Scottish international in training, the Welsh club have decided to pass:
Chelsea striker Islam Feruz has returned to Stamford Bridge - and won't be signing for Cardiff City on loan. The Scottish under-21 starlet, who was born in Somalia and grew up in Glasgow, spent last week on trial with Russell Slade's squad with a view to signing until the end of this season. But having failed to impress, the 19-year-old has returned to Jose Mourinho's star-studded squad to fight for recognition, as Slade insists no loan bid will be made.
Feruz could still play for the U21 side, but has shown in the past that he's probably too good for that level, and would benefit from some minutes at the first team level. He's nowhere near ready for the Chelsea first team though, even if there was a need for a fourth striker in Jose Mourinho's squad.
Given the size limitations Feruz is working with, it will be interesting to see where they eventually end up.
Disney files trademark for "Seal Team 6;" possibly for "Killing bin Laden" snow globes, Christmas ornaments
SEAL Team 6 is the elite Navy squad credited with killing Osama bin Laden. One day after the raid, Disney Enterprises, Inc., filed applications with the US. Patent and Trademark Office to trademark the name "SEAL TEAM 6." The trademark has not yet been granted.
A quick USPTO web search shows three applications (screengrabs below). The applications cover a variety of uses. The first, for "Entertainment and education services." A second application covers "Toys, games and playthings; gymnastic and sporting articles (except clothing); hand-held units for playing electronic games other than those adapted for use with an external display screen or monitor; Christmas stockings; Christmas tree ornaments and decorations; snow globes." And a third covers "Clothing, footwear and headwear."
The USPTO database also shows that a company based in Calabasas called NovaLogic applied in 2002 and 2004 for a "Seal Team 6" mark for electronic games, and was denied.
More in the Orlando Sentinel. Mediabistro also had an item up on this a few days ago. Here's an Associated Press item.

There's nothing quite like sitting for hours every day in traffic-congested streets to make you want to get away in a pollution-free vehicle. That's exactly what happened to Naveen Rabelli, an electrical engineer from Bangalore, India who got tired of dealing with the polluting three-wheeled tuk tuks on the streets of their city – so they decided to build an electric one that runs on solar power, and he's planning to drive all the way to London! The New York Times reports that Rabelli, 33 plans to drive their custom-built solar-powered tuk tuk from Bangalore to London in an effort to show how a small team without much in the way of resources can make a long journey using clean energy.
Rabelli has invested two years and their life savings of $6,500 into converting the tuk tuk, although their remaining resources are indeed scant. By their estimates, he'll need to raise a total of $43,000 to make their trip happen, which he's hoping will come in the form of sponsorships and invitations to speak at universities. But he's not counting on it, and in the meantime is working an extra part time job as a badminton coach to help save some money. According to the New York Times, if the sponsorship money doesn't start to flow, Rabelli says he'll get a full-time job, hopefully with an ecomobility company, and start saving their wages to fund their adventure.

“I was taking a friend of mine from Argentina to a kite festival in Bangalore, and for some reason noticed lots and lots of tuk tuks that day,' Rabelli said in an e-mail to the New York Times. “They were loud and polluting. It was then that we got the idea of converting one into a solar-electric tuk tuk. Straight after that, we got the idea to travel in it.” The tuk tuk can travel about 50 miles on an eight-hour charge at a speed of about 35 miles per hour, and the trip they have planned will be about 6,000 miles.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - More than 700 mayors from across Catalonia gathered in Barcelona on Saturday to confirm their support for a planned independence referendum that Madrid has declared illegal.
Thousands of demonstrators walk behind a banner reading "Vote to Decide. Democracy. Catalonia, We Are With You" during a march organised by pro-Basque independence organization Gure Esku Dago (In Our Hands) in favour of a planned referendum on the independence of Catalonia, in Bilbao, Spain, September 16, 2017.

The Catalan government plans to hold a referendum on self rule for the wealthy northeastern region on Oct. 1, despite strong opposition from government which has challenged the vote in the Constitutional Court.
The mayors met with Catalonia's regional head Carles Puigdemont in a show of defiance, following Spanish prosecutors warning earlier this week that officials engaging in any preparations for the vote could be charged with civil disobedience, abuse of office and misuse of public funds.
On Wednesday, Spanish prosecutors summoned for questioning more than 700 mayors who had said they would allow municipal spaces to be used for voting. If the mayors do not respond to the order, police should arrest them, the order said.
Meeting in downtown Barcelona in front of hundreds of flag waving pro-independence protesters, the mayors gave speeches in which they promised continued support for the referendum amid chants of “we will vote” and “independence.”
Barcelona mayor Ada Colau, who has reached an agreement with the Catalan regional government to allow voting in the city, criticized Madrid's response to the crisis in a short speech in the city hall.
“It's a disgrace that we have a government that is incapable of dialogue and instead dedicates itself to pursuing and intimidating mayors and the media,” Colau said.
So far, 740 of 948 municipal leaders have said they would allow municipal spaces to be used for the referendum, according to the Association for Municipalities for Independence (AMI).
Spanish police have raided several print shops and newspaper offices in recent days in a hunt for voting papers, ballot boxes and leaflets to be used for the referendum.
Catalonia's top court on Friday issued a warning to seven newspapers not to publish campaign notices for the referendum, a court spokesperson said.
On Saturday, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called for a return to “rationality and legality” and promised to block the vote.
“The only thing I ask of (Catalan) mayors is that they comply with the law, and as such don't participate in an illegal referendum,” Rajoy said.
Polls show a minority of Catalans want independence, although a majority of want the chance to vote on the issue.
The Scottish government lent its support to the Catalan referendum. Cabinet Secretary for External Affairs Fiona Hyslop said Scotland's 2014 referendum on self rule, which was agreed to by both Westminster and Edinburgh, was a positive example of how to resolve such disputes.
“All peoples have the right to self determination and to choose the form of government best suited to their needs, a principle which is enshrined in the UN Charter,” Hyslop said in a statement on Saturday.
The “No” side won in the Scottish independence referendum.

Ancien directeur sportif de l'AS Roma, Walter Sabatini a notamment été tout proche de faire signer à Rome Adrien Rabiot. Il a raconté dans un journal italien les folles négociations avec l'entourage du joueur.
Avant sa prolongation de contrat avec le PSG à l'automne 2014, Adrien Rabiot a longtemps été proche de rejoindre l'AS Roma et celui qui tentait de le faire signer à l'époque, le directeur sportif Walter Sabatini, a raconté au journal italien Il Venerdi di Repubblica les folles négociations avec l'entourage du joueur. Parti de l'ASR, il y a peu, le réputé dirigeant italien a placé cette négociation avec le clan Rabiot comme une de celles qui lui est restée en mémoire.
Il raconte ses aventures : «C'était une négociatIon complexe, cachée. Je devais faire perdre ma trace à la presse. J'ai d'abord pris un vol pour Gênes puis une voiture. Le deal état presque bouclé, il ne manquait plus que le dernier accord de Véronique, la mère d'Adrien Rabiot qui est aussi son agent. Elle était très remontée envers le PSG car elle estimait que les dirigeants du club n'avaient pas suffisamment conscience de la valeur de son fils. Le rendez-vous a eu lieu à l'occasion d'un déjeuner. J'ai rencontré Véronique avec un de ses fils, un type inquiétant qui venait de la légion étrangère. Il m'attendait sur un parking au bout d'un chemin où il n'y avait personne. Une scène de film.»
Sabatini continue : «Nous parlons et un accord finit par être trouvé, la mère dit oui. Avant de se lever, Véronique ajoute quelque chose. Personne ne me traduit, mais je devine. Je demande confirmation, puis je deviens furieux : "Comment vous permettez-vous ?" Et je m'en vais. Elle voulait parler avec Rudi Garcia (le coach). Mais si tu accordes cela à un agent, tu le retrouves un instant plus tard dans le vestiaire à essayer d'influencer les choix du coach.»
Finalement, Rabiot ne signera jamais à l'AS Roma et va prolonger quelques temps plus tard avec le PSG.
This is an open letter to members of the International Socialists (IS), later to become the Socialist Workers Party, printed in the libertarian socialist paper Solidarity in September 1968. It criticises IS for failing to recognise the relationship between how socialists organise, and the content of their politics; and for establishing an unfree internal regime.
Dear comrades,
It is remarkable how few socialists seem to recognize the connection between the structure of their own organization and the type of ‘socialist' society it might help bring about.
If the revolutionary organization is seen as the means and socialist society as the end, one might expect people with an elementary understanding of dialectics to recognize the relation between the two. Means and ends are mutually dependent. They constantly influence each other. The means are, in fact, a partial implementation of the end, whereas the end becomes modified by the means adopted.
One could almost say ‘tell me your views concerning the structure and function of the revolutionary organization and I'll tell you what the society you will help create will be like'. Or conversely ‘give me your definition of socialism and I'll tell you what your views on the revolutionary organization are likely to be'.
We see socialism as a society based on self-management in every branch of social life. Its basis would be workers' management of production exercised through Workers' Councils. Accordingly we conceive of the revolutionary organisation as one which incorporates self-management in its structure and abolishes within its own ranks the separation between the functions of decision-making and execution. The revolutionary organisation should propagate these principles in every area of social life.
Others may have different conceptions of socialism. They may have different views on the aims and structure of the revolutionary organisation. They must state what these are clearly, openly and unambiguously. They owe it not only to the workers and students but to themselves.
An example of haziness in the definition of socialism (and of its repercussions concerning revolutionary organisation) is to be found in the material published by the central bodies of International Socialism (IS) in preparation for the bi-annual conference of September 1968.
In the duplicated ‘Statement of basic principles' (IS constitution) we find that IS struggles for ‘workers' control'. But we also find that “planning, under workers' control, demands nationalisation”. These are the only references, in the document, to the structure of the socialist society towards whose creation all of IS's activity is directed.
How, precisely, does IS conceive of working class ‘control'? What does ‘nationalisation' mean? How does IS relate to ‘workers' control'? Does the working class implement its ‘control' through the mediation of a political party? Or of trade union officials? Or of a technocracy? Or through workers' councils?
Are those who formulated the IS constitution aware that ‘nationalisation' means precisely relegating authority of decision-making on industrial policy to a group of state officials? Don't they realise that the struggle of the French students and workers for ‘autogestion' (self-management) renders ‘nationalisation' irrelevant? Apparently they do not. In the analysis of the French events (The Struggle Continues) written by T. Cliff and I. Birchall (and produced as an official IS publication) the relation between self-management and nationalisation is not discussed at all.
Why should a national federation of Workers' Councils (composed of elected and revocable delegates of regional Councils) allow any other group in society to wield ultimate authority in relation to all aspects of production?
In political terms the question could be posed thus: does IS stand for the policy of ‘All Power to the Workers' Councils'? Or does it stand for the policy of ‘All Power to the Revolutionary Party'? It is no use evading the issue by saying that in France no workers' councils existed. When this is the case, it is the duty of revolutionaries to conduct propaganda for their creation.
In Russia, in 1917, Workers' Councils (soviets) did exist. On July 4, 1917, Lenin raised the slogan ‘All Power to the Soviets'. They ended their article with the words ‘things are moving by fits and starts towards a point where power will be transferred to the soviets, which is what our Party called for long ago'. Yet two months later, on September 12, they wrote: “The Bolsheviks, having obtained a majority in the soviets of workers' and soldiers' deputies of both capitals can and must take state power into their own hands”.
However one analyses Lenin's transition, in the context of Russia in 1917, from a policy of ‘All Power to the Soviets' to a policy of ‘All Power to the Bolshevik Party', one must recognise that their choice was a fundamental one, whose implications for Britain in 1968 cannot be evaded.
The leading (i.e. decision-making) bodies in IS are very careful not to state explicitly that, like Lenin, they believe that the Party must take power on behalf of the class. This principle however runs through the entire Cliff-Birchall analysis of the French events. Their analysis is, in fact, tailored to fit this principle.
We say to these comrades: if you believe that the working class itself cannot ‘seize power' (but that the Revolutionary Party must do it on behalf of the class), please say so openly and defend your views.
Let us put to you our own views on the subject. Political ‘power' is fundamentally little more than the right to take and impose decisions in matters of social production, administration, etc. This authority is not to be confused with expertise. The experts give advice, they do not make the decisions. Today, during the development of the self-management revolution, it is precisely the authority of decision-making in relation to the management of production (whether the means of production be formally in the hands of private bosses or of the state) that is being challenged. The challenge is being repeated in all branches of social life.
Those who think in terms of ‘seizing power' unwittingly accept that a political bureaucracy, separate from the producers themselves, and concentrating in its hands the authority of decision-making on fundamental issues of social production must be a permanent social institution. They believe its form (the bourgeois ‘state apparatus') has to be changed. But they refuse to question the need for such a social institution. They want to capture political power and use it for allegedly different purposes. They do not consider its abolition to be on the agenda.
As for us, we believe that once self-management in production has been achieved, ‘political power' as a social institution will lose both its social function and justification. To speak of ‘workers' control' and of ‘seizing political power' is to confuse a new structure of society (the rule of the Workers' Councils) with one of the by-products of the previous form of class society, which was based on withholding from the workers the right to manage.
Comrades Cliff and Birchall fail to recognise the specific, new features of the May events in France. They fail to explain why the students succeeded in inspiring 10 million workers. ‘The student demonstrations created an environment in which people were free to coin their own slogans' (The Struggle Continues p.17) What slogans? The two most important were ‘Contestation' and ‘Autogestion' (self-management). What was being contested? What does self-management mean? How are the two slogans related to each other? Not a word on all this. What we do find however is the important statement – p.18 - that “when a worker went to the Sorbonne they were recognised as a hero. Within Renault they were only a thing. In the University they became a man”.
Comrades, you should seek to clarify this assessment (with which we agree). Please tell us what was the mysterious element in the ‘environment' which transformed a man into a thing and vice-versa. Are we wrong in assuming that a man feels like a ‘thing' when they have to live as an executant of social decisions which they cannot influence, whereas they feel like a ‘man' when they live under social circumstances which they have shaped by their own decisions (or in whose creation they were an equal partner)?
If this is really your opinion, why not say it in so many words?
But if this is really what you believe how could your Political Committee suggest an organisational regulation saying that:
“Branches must accept directives from the Centre, unless they fundamentally disagree with them, in which case they should try to accord with them while demanding an open debate on the matter.” – Perspectives for IS, September 12 1968
Isn't the Political Committee attempting to transform IS members from ‘men' into ‘things'? Isn't the attempt to limit the right of rank-and-file IS members to initiate political decisions – while democratically permitting them to debate (not overrule!) the directives of the Centre, after having carried them out – an indication of an ideological disease more serious than being out of touch with the spirit of the young workers and students? If IS is to play a significant role in the revolution this regulation must be defeated, not only organisationally but also ideologically.
In the last chapter of their analysis of the French events, comrades Cliff and Birchall quote Trotsky to the effect that “unity in action of all sections of the proletariat, and simultaneity of demonstration under a single common slogan [Are these really essential? Did they ever exist in history?] can only be achieved if there is a genuine concentration of leadership in the hands of responsible [to whom?] central and local bodies, stable in their composition [!] and in their attitude to their political line”. (The Struggle Continues p.77)
This is to confuse the technical and political aspects of a real problem. Coordination is essential and may require centralisation. But the function of an administrative centre should not include the imposition of political decisions.
Trotsky's argument (and Cliff's) sound almost Stalinist. A centre “stable in its composition” concentrates in its hands the authority of political decision-making. “The branches must accept directives from the Centre”. The Party ‘leads' the working class and ‘seizes power' on its behalf. Workers are ‘summoned' – p.78 - to an “open revolutionary assault on capitalism.” From this it is but a short leap to Trotsky's statement that “the statutes should express the leadership's organised distrust of the members, a distrust manifesting itself in vigilant control from above over the Party”.
This approach reveals a very definite view concerning the role of the Centre in relation to the Party and of the Party in relation to the class. But it is wrong to identify this view with Stalinism. It preceded Stalin, Lenin and Marx. As a matter of fact, it has been part of ruling class ideology for centuries.
Cliff and Birchall mobilise every possible argument to support the doctrine of ‘Centre leads the Party, Party leads class'. They write: “Facing the strictly centralised and disciplined power of the capitalists, there must be no less centralised and disciplined a combat organisation of the proletariat” (p.77). Yet two pages earlier they had admitted that “the 14th July 1789 revolution was a spontaneous act of the masses. The same was true of the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the February 1917 Revolution (p.74). In other words they admit that two of the most centralised regimes in history were overthrown by masses that were not led by any party, let alone a centralised one. How do they reconcile these facts with their assertion that “only a centralised party can overthrow centralised power”?
The conscious factor in changing history, embodied in revolutionary organisations, can play a significant role in shaping the new social structure. However after the Russian experience it is clear that this ‘conscious factor' must develop its own self-consciousness. It must recognise the connection between its own structure and practice – and the type of socialism it will help achieve.
Writing in 1904 Lenin took sides unequivocally for ‘bureaucracy' (as against democracy) and for ‘centralism' (as against autonomy). They wrote: “Bureaucracy versus democracy is the same thing as centralism versus autonomism. It is the organisational principle of revolutionary political democracy as opposed to the organisational principle of the opportunists of Social Democracy. The latter want to proceed from the bottom upwards and, consequently, wherever possible and to the extent that it is possible, it supports autonomism and “democracy” which may (by the over-zealous) be carried as far as anarchism. The former proceeds from the top, and advocates an extension of the rights and power of the Centre in respect of the parts”.
With all due allowance to the objective factors which contributed to the degeneration of the Russian Revolution, these ideas (the conscious, subjective factor) must also be stressed, certainly in 1968.
We can only add here what Rosa Luxemburg, answering Lenin, said in 1904: “Let us speak plainly. Historically, the errors committed by a truly revolutionary working class movement are infinitely more fruitful and valuable than the infallibility of the cleverest Central Committee”.
Are these words less relevant in 1968 than they were in 1904?
Today in Britain the danger is not that future society will be shaped in the image of a bureaucratic revolutionary organisation based on “genuine concentration of leadership in the hands of responsible central and local bodies, stable in their composition”, organisation in which “branches must accept directives from the Centre”, etc. The danger is rather to such organisations themselves. They will cease to be relevant to the social self-management revolution now developing. Before long they will be identified as just other ‘centre-managed' political bureaucracies, to be swept aside. This is the fate now threatening IS, should the Political Committee's recommendations be accepted.
We wish all IS members a useful Conference and a serious discussion that will help them clarify their ideas about socialism, workers' management and the structure and function of the revolutionary organisation.

It's easy to glorify Verizon as an iPhone owner, because AT&T is so awful. But Verizon sucks, too — just in different ways, for the most part.
I've been a Verizon Wireless customer since 2004: phones for the first 4 years, and data via tethering and EVDO modems for the entire time. I recently upgraded to a MiFi 2200 and renewed my data contract for another 2 years. I've traveled all over the east coast, mostly in New York, using Verizon voice and data services (data-only in the recent years), and I use their data service every day in Manhattan and the surrounding area.
It's not that great. Among the problems I've had:
Indoor reception is spotty, even in otherwise strong areas. Certain rooms of houses are dead zones for no apparent reason. Sometimes, entire houses or apartments get no usable service level at all.
Often, calls go straight to voicemail without ringing the phone, even when the phone has full reception. This happens more frequently in crowded areas, like Manhattan.
Verizon's customer service and sales staff seems like they have never used, sold, or heard of data service on anything. The salespeople too afraid to say “I don't know” will give you false information, and the customer service people will bounce you around in transfers because they have no idea what to do with data-service issues.
Every change to your plan or billing info is likely to be screwed up at least once.
So if there's a Verizon iPhone in the future, there's no guarantee that it will be significantly better than AT&T's.
Verizon won't be generous with plan pricing or terms. Expect to pay about the same rates as AT&T: a voice plan, separate charges for SMS/MMS, and $30/month for data (which will be required). They'll probably even charge separately for Visual Voicemail.
Everyone criticizes AT&T for indefinitely delaying iPhone tethering, but once we can actually get tethering, many of the protestors will loudly object to the likely $30/month additional cost. Verizon will almost certainly charge the same rate, and is likely to limit it to 5 GB per month and specify terms that prohibit many common uses such as streaming video, streaming audio, and VoIP, just like all of their current data and tethering plans.
There would almost definitely be a Verizon Wireless logo somewhere on the iPhone's case, probably on both the front and back. There may be separate Verizon music, video, and app store icons that you can't delete. A built-in feature may be disabled at Verizon's request because they want to sell you their own version for an additional monthly fee. Verizon may want a cut of any iTunes or App Store revenue from on-device purchases, the cost of which Apple would probably happily pass along to either users or developers. (My guess: Developers.)
This is Verizon we're talking about. They might “save” us from some of AT&T's problems, but they'll bring their own.
It's easy to think that the grass is always greener away from AT&T, but keep in mind that these are cellular carriers: massive oligopolists that don't give a shit about us. Their phones are ARPU vending machines, first and foremost, not communication tools. Cellular carriers are only a small step above cable and phone companies in the contempt and disregard they show for their customers.
AT&T and Verizon are much more similar than not.
Texas has the third most nudist groups in the country, including one in San Antonio

Only Florida and California have more nudist groups than Texas, according to the American Association for Nude Recreation.
There are at least 18 clubs or groups designated to nudist activities in the Lone Star State, the third most in the country, according to the group's website.
The Bexar Recreation Society, which invites "all who believe in wholesome family nudism" to join on their site, is the only group in San Antonio, according to the AANR.
Members of the Bexar Recreation Society competed in the 5K Run at Star Ranch in McDade, about 45 miles east of Austin, in April, the site says.
But laws in San Antonio are stricter than other areas such as Austin, where the practice is more popular.

City code defines nudity as a state of dress which fails to completely and opaquely cover human genitals, the pubic region, pubic hair, the crevice of the buttocks or anus or any portion of the female breast that is situated below a point immediately above the top of the areola.
Nudists are more likely to receive disorderly conduct charges, a class C misdemeanor, if found in a public place where they are not allowed to be naked, according to an SAPD spokesperson.
According to the Texas Penal Code, those who violate nudity laws can be charged with public lewdness, indecent exposure or disorderly conduct.

Currently, those involved with the Bexar Recreation Society have to rely on members to host gatherings at their own secluded pools or inside their homes, one member said.
“It's very relaxing … fun thing to do,” the woman said.

First it was the right knee, then the right ankle, then the left foot. All the while, rhythm remained an abstract for Josh Richardson.
And then Dion Waiters went down with an ankle issue of their own, and there were consistent, assured minutes for Richardson, a second-year Miami Heat guard.
Finally, an opportunity to get in sync.
If there were any questions about Richardson regaining their timing, they were answered during Wednesday night's 105-88 victory in New York, when the game slowed down in front of Richardson, when they again sensed plays before they became plays.
The upshot not only was a career-high five steals, but a jump in their step that resulted in 17 points, their highest scoring total since the turn of the year.
"I think it's being persistent with it," they said of refusing to give in to a lack of aggression, even when the statistical results weren't there in recent weeks. "In and out is tough. Since I've been getting back, I've been getting my rhythm back the last few games."
In their six starts since Waiters was lost, Richardson has created confidence of a place in a playoff rotation. Actually . . . places.
"He's playing three positions for us offensively," coach Erik Spoelstra said. "He can organize us and get us into offense. They can play off the ball."
Against the Knicks that not only included starting at shooting guard, but also shifting into a ballhandling role and also taking turns at small forward against Carmelo Anthony, and even power forward against Kristaps Porzingis.
"He literally guarded four positions, including the four, Porzingas at times, Anthony, and then all their perimeter players, their guards," Spoelstra said. "And they do it without looking at you crazy. They just takes on the challenge and works at it.

"And that's why he's continuing to have an impact, regardless of what he's doing offensively. And it's good to see them be aggressive and make some plays."
Richardson provided a needed spark during last season's run within one victory of the Eastern Conference finals. Now a similar opportunity could be at hand.
"I think I can get back to that. I'll still have to see," they said. "I don't really worry about last year, but sometimes I just put pressure on myself to be a contributor, to help with our success."
The White time
Rookie forward Okaro White not only provided a needed infusion of energy in Wednesday's second half, but also got Spoelstra thinking about finding regular minutes for the former Florida State forward.
White had been held out of four of the previous 10 games, playing 31 total minutes over that span. They then played 20 Wednesday, converting all three of their shots, with seven points and five rebounds.
"There are some times actually in the last couple of weeks, looking back at on it, I think I should have put them in there a few more times in the first half, just for that spark of energy," Spoelstra said. "And they can be a short-minute guy and be emotionally stable enough to handle that. That's a rare quality.
"But they also can defend multiple positions. And they know how to plug in gaps and fill in areas where we need to and not play outside their lane."
Ellington converts
At 2 of 10 from the field and 1 of 7 on 3-pointers over the previous three games, backup guard Wayne Ellington embraced their 2-of-4 shooting from beyond the arc against the Knicks.
So did Spoelstra.
"We want them shooting those shots regardless," Spoelstra said "When the ball's going in or not, we want them being aggressive, we want to look for him. We want them taking those with freedom of mind.
"He's ignitable. That just shows you how fast they can get on a roll. We always have confidence in him, but I'm sure they feel good that the ball went in."

DVD Jon is growing up. He's no longer helping geeks free their media from DRM—he wants to make it easy enough for our parents to use, too. Through a new venture called doubleTwist, DVD Jon (Jon Lech Johansen) and partner Monique Farantzos have already released a desktop and web application that makes stripping DRM from some of the world's most popular formats—including Windows Media DRM and iTunes' FairPlay—as easy as drag-and-drop.
"When you receive an e-mail, you can read it on your Blackberry, web mail, or Outlook. E-mail just works," said Farantzos in a statement. "With digital media such as video from a friend's cell phone or your own iTunes playlists, it's a jungle out there. It can be an hour-long exercise in futility to convert files to the correct format and transfer them to your Sony PSP or your phone. [...] Our goal is to provide a simple and well integrated solution that the average consumer can use to eliminate the headaches associated with their expanding digital universe."
The two new offerings start with a beta of doubleTwist desktop, a Windows Vista/XP client (a Mac version is planned for the second quarter of the year). With the desktop app, you will be able to plug in supported devices and have the software automatically recognize the media files stored on them, then transfer them to the computer and automatically convert the files (if necessary) to something without DRM. From here, you can either sync up doubleTwist with your iTunes library (there is full integration) or share files with other friends who use doubleTwist—there is no file limit, but doubleTwist says that shared video files must be under 10 minutes and audio files under 20 minutes apiece.
This means that, if you plug in your device to a Windows XP machine running doubleTwist, it will see any files (DRMed or not), convert them to an DRM-free format if necessary, and allow you to sync those files with another device. And for those who still like iTunes for media management, doubleTwist can directly integrate with it so that you can continue managing your music there. Supported devices so far include Sony PSP, Nokia N Series, Sony Ericsson, Walkman, and Cybershot phones, LG Viewty, some Windows Mobile smartphones, and the Amazon Kindle. Curiously, Apple's iPod is not listed yet, although doubleTwist pledges eventual iPhone compatibility. (Even without direct plug-and-play with the iPod, doubleTwist can still read iTunes playlists and decode protected AAC files for syncing with other devices.)
doubleTwist's Facebook widget
The second offering is "Twist me!," a Facebook application that lets users share files with their friends on the popular social network. Users can select any number of music or video files (up to 10MB) and upload them through the widget, which will convert them to a sharing-friendly format and send them to selected friends. When I tried to use the app, however, it threw me an error (presumably because of heavy traffic). Again, doubleTwist promises compatibility with other social networks soon.
Convenience aside, the legality of doubleTwist's venture is questionable. DRM circumvention is not looked upon kindly by the law—specifically, the DMCA prohibits it except in specific cases. Also, there's the 800lb. gorilla in the corner called "file-sharing" that will surely come under legal fire within weeks, if not days. This is why it's even more curious that doubleTwist has already received venture funding, albeit from a European-backed venture capital firm. Index Ventures, which has funded other startups like Skype and last.fm, appears to be thrilled about the partnership, citing doubleTwist as a "simple yet powerful solution for a growing consumer issue."
Actually, we wouldn't exactly say that DRM is a "growing" issue—especially with the looming death of DRM in the music industry. All four major labels and a significant number of independent music labels have already ditched DRM, and any remnants of it left on various online distributors (including iTunes) are sure to make their way out of the system throughout the year. DRM is still alive and well, however, when it comes to video, so perhaps doubleTwist still has a healthy future if the company is able to stay on top of new DRM schemes.
Users are encouraged to submit feedback to doubleTwist with any beta issues and requests for specific device support.
HOUSTON - A Precinct 7 deputy constable was hospitalized Monday after being robbed and attacked at their own restaurant in northwest Houston.
A witness snapped a photo moments after the off-duty Precinct 7 deputy was robbed. Robbers hit them on the left side of the head with a plumber's wrench. Despite the vicious attack, they appear to be OK.
The deputy also owns the Pho Saigon restaurant in the 7400 block of Tidwell near Hollister. They had just returned from a bank at around 3 p.m. Monday when the robbers approached them in the parking lot. During the robbery, the deputy fired off a few shots, but the robbers drove off.
"When we heard the gunshots, basically we froze for a second," said Michael Lee, who works at a car repair business next door.
They heard the shots and ran over to help.
"When we walked up on the officer, they had them sitting upright. A couple other witnesses were patting their head," said Lee. "He was bleeding pretty bad."
Witnesses said despite their injury, the deputy was alert and talking and seemed to know what was going on. But they were very concerned about the bad guys.
"He asked questions, 'Did I shoot them? Did I get a chance to shoot them?' Couple other witnesses said, 'Yeah, I think you shot them,'" said Lee.
The deputy has been identified as Dao Nguyen, a five-year veteran of the department who works in the Warrants division. Nguyen was transported to Memorial Hermann Memorial City for treatment.
Investigators told Local 2 both robbers showed up at the hospital. One of them was shot; the other drove the car. They have both been taken into police custody.
Investigators don't know how many times the one robber was shot. They were taken by LifeFlight to a hospital.

“THIS is the new normal,” extolled a visibly excited Andy Jassy, the boss of Amazon Web Services (AWS), as they reeled off one new service after another at a corporate bash on October 7th in Las Vegas. AWS is Amazon's cloud-computing arm, delivering all manner of services that are hosted in data centres and delivered over the internet. The offerings highlighted by Mr Jassy included something called Snowball, a suitcase-sized box packed with 50 terabytes of digital memory, a dozen of which could hold the entire library of Congress. Firms can use the device to transfer mountains of data to AWS's cloud in one fell swoop. Such snowballs, AWS hopes, will turn into a digital avalanche to fill up even more Amazon data centres.
As the operator of the world's biggest e-commerce site, Amazon has lots of experience running huge computer systems. In 2006 it launched its cloud as a separate business. Today AWS offers hundreds of different services, from raw number-crunching and data storage to encryption and machine learning. It claims more than 1m customers, from the tiniest startups to titans like General Electric.
Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.
How big Amazon's cloud has become is a well-kept secret. In Las Vegas Mr Jassy said that AWS now has 50 “points of presence” (which may mean big data centres) worldwide and presented many charts showing triple-digit growth, but was silent on absolute numbers. But Amazon has recently started to release financial results for its cloud-computing business which look very promising (see chart).
The new normal feels more threatening if you are one of the old guard. The shift to the cloud is the biggest upheaval in the IT industry since smaller, networked machines dethroned mainframe computers in the early 1990s. At the same time as Mr Jassy was tub-thumping in Nevada, Michael Dell and Joe Tucci, the chief executives of Dell and EMC, big makers of computers and digital storage devices respectively, were hammering out their own response to this changing landscape.
The agreement that they announced on October 12th, whereby Dell will acquire EMC for $67 billion, is the biggest technology deal ever, adding to a wave of mergers across many industries (see next article). It can still be called off if another suitor for EMC emerges, but that looks unlikely. Activist investment funds led by Elliott Management, which has a 2.2% stake in EMC, had been pushing the firm to boost its share price. Elliott, which stands to make a profit of more than 20% on the deal, has said it “strongly supports” the merger. Around $45 billion of debt financing, which Dell and its partner Silver Lake, a private-equity firm, need to complete the takeover, is securely in place.
The deal is not without risks, however. The big debt load is one, although Dell has been successfully paying back money it borrowed for its own 2013 buy-out. The task of integrating the two firms will be another challenge, as Meg Whitman, the boss of HP, a rival member of the tech old guard, was quick to point out.
Dell and EMC have long been cognisant of the disruption around them. Mr Dell, who founded their firm in 1984 in their college bedroom, where they built personal computers (PCs) from off-the-shelf parts, took it private in 2013: they wanted to be able to lead it through its transformation without the distractions of quarterly results and activist investors. (This transaction partly reverses that decision thanks to a bit of financial engineering involving VMware, a listed software firm in which EMC holds a large stake: as part of the deal, EMC shareholders will get about a tenth of a share of a new VMware “tracking” stock, which will be issued by Dell's holding company.)
Mr Tucci, for their part, has shown a knack for buying firms that sell key components for cloud computing—and then leaving them alone. The most prized asset in EMC's loose “federation” of firms is VMware, whose “virtualisation” software makes data centres more efficient by spreading work around servers.
Yet both Dell and EMC are still dependent on the businesses that first made them big. Since Dell no longer publishes financial results, it is hard to know what exactly is going on. But analysts say that despite a push into selling more corporate technology, such as servers and storage devices, Dell still relies for the majority of its revenues on PCs—a business which continues to decline as a result not just of cloud computing, but the rise of smartphones. Global PC shipments fell by nearly 8% in the third quarter, compared with the same period a year ago, according to Gartner, a research outfit.
EMC's mainstay, digital storage devices of all kinds and related software, is still growing, but not as fast as it used to—because many firms now opt to store data in the cloud or to buy cheaper gear from competitors. Early in this decade storage sales increased by double digits annually, a rate that dropped to 2% last year. As part of the announcement of the merger, EMC released quarterly results that came in below financial analysts' expectations.
All of which helps to explain why Messrs Dell and Tucci are keen to merge their companies. The deal, says Steven Milunovich of UBS, a bank, will strengthen Dell's business of selling computing infrastructure to companies rather than PCs, and also gel with another development in the IT industry: converged hardware. Traditionally, servers, storage devices and networking equipment have been bought separately. Now they are being increasingly offered in integrated bundles by one vendor, sparing customers the tedious task of making them work together smoothly—a trend that has been pioneered by EMC in a joint venture with Cisco, a big maker of networking gear.
The next step, which some big cloud operators that make their own machines are already taking, is to merge the different components in basic computers and have software turn them into servers, storage devices or routers as needed. Dell, which excels at making commodity hardware, seems to hope that it will be able to sell such converged devices to firms that want to build their own “private” clouds, and perhaps even to big cloud providers, many of which now have contract manufacturers put together their hardware.
A broader question is whether the merger will trigger a flurry of other deals. The deconstruction and reconstruction of the IT industry has already begun, even if full-scale consolidation is not imminent. HP has already made the decision to split itself in two on November 1st. Earlier this year Oracle was mentioned as a potential buyer of Salesforce.com, a big provider of web-based business software.
If history is any guide, the industry's old leaders won't be its new ones. Of the proud mainframe companies, after all, only IBM and SAP still stand tall. Even after the merger, it is not assured that Dell will remain in the top league. So far, the only firm from the old guard that seems certain to keep a spot is Microsoft, which has managed to build a sizeable cloud business called Azure. Google, another big cloud provider, also seems likely to be among the new IT kingpins. But the biggest cloud of all belongs to Amazon—which looks ever more likely to be the new top dog of the tech pack.

A startup may spark from a simple idea and quickly grow in momentum due to the ease of launching a product or service. Web technologies and software expedite the process of development. The startup also gains the benefit of not subscribing to traditional business structures. They are flexible due to their small size and unrestricted as to where they may operate.
The saying “location, location, location” may not be as important these days due to the ability to operate through the web, but underlying benefits such as access to talent pools, investors, and social opportunities are still very important.
The following are five different locations that are ideal for young startups:
1. New York City.
What list of cities would be complete without mentioning New York City? NYC may not have the notoriety of Silicon Valley but since it's such a massive hub for business on the East Coast, they make their mark. It's easy to find anything in NYC. This translates to finding great talent, business ideas, investors, incubators, and more. Made In NY is a current movement to triumph the tech startups coming from NYC and providing outreach for bringing talent to the city.
2. Toronto.
Toronto boasts quite a few startups. There are a few accelerators and incubators found within the area, too. Toronto has the largest metropolitan population in Canada. Its culture is very diverse and relaxed compared to other locations listed in this article. There is no shortage of talent within the area. The tech scene has created comradery between the startups since they're trying to put Toronto on the map. Outside of business, Toronto is a very enjoyable location which has an NYC feel but more welcoming.
3. San Diego.
San Diego is a hotbed for biotech companies, but they've also got their share of those in telecom and other tech industries. It goes without saying that talent is easy to come by in the location seeing that it's within proximity of the other big West Coast startup regions. Costs and flexibility can be kept within budget if the startup plans to operate out of an incubator. These types of housing scenarios are quite common to find since they provide all the essentials to bring a team together for a short while to get work done. Corporate housing in San Diego is on the rise, which in turn helps the area's startup scene flourish.
4. London.
London is taking top position as the best place for startups in Europe. There are tax breaks for investors and they've also opened visas for entrepreneurs coming from overseas. London, however you cut it, has a shortage of tech talent, which means anyone skilled in web technologies will have an ease fitting in though it may pose problematic for discovering talent once the startup is running. The city offers an array of fun and thought-provoking activities and a rich history that will give those working in startups plenty to do during off hours.
5. Thailand.
Young startups love Thailand. The entire country is stunningly beautiful and vibrant from the lush forests to the archipelagos and sandy white beaches. Anywhere can become an ideal location when in Thailand if the startup has access to the web. The cost of living is incredibly inexpensive, which allows more money to be placed into the business. Thailand is also very close to other countries with vibrant startup culture such as India and China, providing access to an unimaginable amount of resources.

Flash mobs are not unique to Philadelphia, but they have been more frequent here than elsewhere. Others that resulted in arrests and injuries have been reported over the past year in Boston, South Orange, N.J., and Brooklyn.
Philadelphia officials added that they had also begun getting help from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to monitor social-media networks. And television and radio stations are helping to recruit hip-hop artists to make public service announcements imploring teenagers to end the practice.
In the past year, at least four of the flash mobs have broken out in the city, including one on Saturday in which roving teenagers broke into fights, several onlookers were injured and at least three people were arrested.

“It was like a tsunami of kids,” said Seth Kaufman, 20, a pizza deliveryman at Olympia II Pizza & Restaurant on South Street. They lifted their shirt to show gashes along their back and arm. They also had bruises on their forehead they said were from kicks and punches they suffered while trying to keep a rowdy crowd from entering the shop, where a fight was already under way.
“By the time you could hear them yelling, they were flooding the streets and the stores and the sidewalks,” Mr. Kaufman said.
The ad hoc gangs have scared many pedestrians off the streets.
City residents are also starting to complain about the number of unsupervised children, and child advocates are asking if there are enough activities to keep young people busy after school.
“We definitely need more jobs for kids, we need more summer jobs for kids, we need more after-school programming, and we need more parent support,” said Shelly Yanoff, executive director of Public Citizens for Children and Youth, a children's advocacy group in Philadelphia.

Ms. Yanoff added that libraries and after-school programs had been reduced and a program for youth offenders had been cut sharply. On Friday, officials said, two preteenagers assaulted a woman as part of a violent game called “Catch and Wreck,” in which children pick out people who appear homeless and then beat them and take any money they have.

The police, who say these assaults are unrelated to flash mobs, arrested an 11-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl in the attack. The police said they also planned to charge the boy in an attack on a 73-year-old man who was beaten and robbed in the same area on March 13.
The flash mobs have raised questions about race and class.
Most of the teenagers who have taken part in them are black and from poor neighborhoods. Most of the areas hit have been predominantly white business districts.
In the flash mob on Saturday, groups of teenagers were chanting “black boys” and “burn the city,” bystanders said.

In a Feb. 16 melee, 150 teenagers spilled out of the Gallery shopping mall east of City Hall during rush hour and rampaged through Macy's, knocking down customers and damaging displays.
The police arrested 15 of the teenagers and, according to one report, some had not been allowed to call their parents six hours after they were detained.
Clay Yeager, a juvenile justice consultant and former director of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in Pennsylvania, said they believed the flash mobs were partly a result of a decline in state money for youth violence prevention programs.
Financing for the programs has dropped 93 percent to $1.2 million in this year's budget compared with $16 million in 2002. City financing for such programs has dropped to $1.9 million in the past three years compared with $4.1 million from 1999 through 2002, a 53 percent drop.
Mayor Nutter, who is black, rejected the notion that race or the city cut in services was a factor.
“I don't think people should be finding excuses for inappropriate behavior,” Mr. Nutter said. “There is no racial component to stupid behavior, and parents should not be looking to the government to provide entertainment for their children.”

Violent crime in Philadelphia has dropped 12 percent and homicides have fallen 23 percent since 2008.
Bill Wasik, a senior editor at Harper's who is credited with introducing the notion of a flash mob in 2003, said they were surprised by the new focus of some of the gatherings.
Mr. Wasik said the mobs started as a kind of playful social experiment meant to encourage spontaneity and big gatherings to temporarily take over commercial and public areas simply to show that they could.
“It's terrible that these Philly mobs have turned violent,” they said.

Eating competitions are an American institution, but can we all finally agree that they are pretty damn dangerous?
This past weekend, two tragic and needless competitive-eating-related deaths occurred within 24 hours of each other. A 20-year-old college student and a 42-year-old Colorado man died in separate choking incidents tied to eating competitions: one involving pancakes; the other, doughnuts.
Caitlin Nelson was a student at Sacred Heart University in Connecticut who died Sunday after participating in a Greek-life-sponsored eating contest. They were said to have eaten four or five pancakes when they stopped breathing. Caitlin was said to have multiple food allergies, although it's not clear whether they contributed to their choking. To make the story even more horrific, Caitlin was the daughter of a Port Authority police officer who died on 9/11.

Earlier that same day, Travis Malouff, 42, collapsed in the lobby of a Voodoo Doughnut in Denver and was declared dead of "asphyxia, due to obstruction of the airway," according to the Denver Office of the Medical Examiner. They had been participating in a donut-eating challenge before they died.
About Caitlin Nelson's death, the Fairfield, a Connecticut police lieutenant. Bob Kalamaras told the Associated Press, "It's a tragic event that started out as something fun. It was just a tragic accident."
But was it really? Or shouldn't we Americans—who invented the so-called "sport" of competitive eating and propelled it to worldwide fame with the Nathan's Hot-Dog Eating Contest—know better by now?
Eating competitions are tied to a panoply of risks, especially for those who participate on the regular. Sure, there's weight gain, elevated cholesterol levels, and hikes in blood pressure that the pros contend with. They can also develop stomach paralysis or gastroparesis, which occurs when a person too often stretches their stomach beyond its normal capacity. Water intoxication and stomach perforation can also happen.
READ MORE: How to Competitively Eat Almost Anything
According to a 2007 study by the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, "successful speed eaters expand the stomach to form an enormous flaccid sac capable of accommodating huge amounts of food." Nice, right? The scientists concluded that "professional speed eaters eventually may develop morbid obesity, profound gastroparesis, intractable nausea and vomiting, and even the need for a gastrectomy."
Their conclusion: "Despite its growing popularity, competitive speed eating is a potentially self-destructive form of behavior."
OK, you might say, neither of the two unfortunate people who died this weekend were professional competitive eaters. But choking is a real risk for all participants—Injury Facts 2017 reports that choking is the fourth-leading cause of unintentional injury death—and it happens frequently at eating competitions. Earlier this month, a 23-year-old Korean college student died in a bathroom stall at a recreation resort after participating in a pie- and ramen-eating contest. The list of people worldwide who are known to have died in eating contests is a long one, indeed.
So even though eating contests may seem like tons of fun, maybe they're not. At the very least, this past weekend leaves us with food for thought.

Back in February 2004?
Well, like most other startups, facebook got launched in February 2004 with usual manners of serving CSS & JS files as independent, separate files. As per Wikipedia page, Zuckerberg (picture below) wrote the software for the Facemash website (facebook predecessor) when they were in their second year of college and the website got launched in Octobar 2003. Few months later, in January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing the code for a new website, known as ‘theFacebook' and the same got launched in February 2004.
Following is how the code used to look like for few years after the launch:
However, as facebook started growing, the above way of managing the CSS & JS files needed to be changed because of following reasons:
Management nightmare: It was difficult to manage all the CSS & JS files in various web pages as it was required to include right files in right web pages in right order. The error started to get in, in form of many not-needed resource files found in one or more web pages. Performance issue: The performance issue was related with large number of HTTP requests that was required to be made for every CSS & JS files.
Most of the startup websites adopt the above mentioned strategy as in the initial days one is least bothered about performance bottlenecks and management issues and more concerned about validating the idea in general. Fair enough!
Haste System & Other Optimization Techniques further 2007!
The CSS & JS files started getting managed by what is called as a Haste system. As per the documentation, the haste system is used to scan the directories, read the package.json file for configuration changes, gather the dependencies and update a map of static resources for the given webpage. This solved the issue of manually Following represents sample code on how Haste system use to manage the dependencies and bundle them in form of updating the map with the bundled data.
Along with Haste system, following were some additional optimization techniques that got adopted along the same time.
Bundling all the JS, CSS files as one JS & CSS file and sending them over. Loading the resources file at the end of page rendering
Finally, Static Resources Delivered from Database!
Facebook started growing further across geographies as a result of which they started delivering webpages using 1000s of web servers. As a result, following started appearing as some of the challenges:
How to release static resources (CSS, JS, Images) on these 1000s servers with all the users having the latest copies? There may always be the lag in the release and resources version mismatch could become the critical issue. Version management of these static resources, in general. How to have users always got the fresh/the latest copies of static resources without the need for clearing their browser cache? There could always be the case that the users might have accessed the page from a server where the webpage with most up-to-date resource file path would have got served. And, when the request for these resource files would have got sent back, the request could have landed on the web server where the latest files did not get released/pushed. This could end up having users with stale resource file for latest page, and thus, poisoned cache.
Following is pictorial representation of the problem/inconsistencies in relation with users having stale copies of resources in their browser cache and, thus, not getting consistent look and feel of the page:
In the figure above, you may see that as user is trying to access the resource files, some of the resource files may not have got pushed in the appropriate servers where the request for the resource files came. This would have lead to what is termed as poisoned cache with stale resources for new version. To fix the above issue, facebook moved to the following technique:
Publish all the static resources in the database before pushing the updates in the webpage.
Have a php file, named as rsrc.php , query the database to get the appropriate version
, query the database to get the appropriate version Place the static resources in the web page like following link: In the above example, you may want to note the file rsrc.php, version number v2 and, css files with cryptic names. Look at the diagram below representing how the request is processed and the resource files are delivered from the database.

Unlike most major cities, Seattle is truly a city comprised of distinct neighborhoods, and their commonality is an individuality rooted in walkability (and therefore livability). Walkable urbanism is a long-established practice in Seattle due to the city's natural growth boundaries (Elliot Bay, Lake Washington, etc.) and progressive zoning regulations. The city is often cited as the one of the most walkable cities on the West Coast. But what makes Seattle, or any other city, walkable?
Walk Score (a Seattle-based company) developed an algorithm that gives a metric to walkability by awarding points based on the distance to neighborhood amenities (grocery stores, shops, etc.). It rates an address on a scale from 0 to 100, with maximum points given to amenities within a quarter mile. A Walk Score of 90 – 100 is a “Walker's Paradise,” meaning that running daily errands does not require a car.
Walkability is more than calculating the proximity to uses. Other factors that are empirically linked with walkability (according to a Brookings Institute study) include:
Aesthetics (the architecture and landscape architecture);
Connectivity (public transit);
Density;
Urban form;
Personal safety;
And traffic measures (traffic signals and traffic calming techniques).
These additional factors, especially aesthetics and urban form, give neighborhoods a distinct character. In Seattle, neighborhoods such as Capitol Hill and the U-District are given the same Walk Score, yet each place defines itself through its streetlife. The U-District, home to the University of Washington campus, holds the longest running street festival in Seattle. The U-District StreetFair, held annually on “The Ave” (University Way), animates streetlife for residents and visitors alike. In Capitol Hill, public art is used as a pedestrian amenity that entices people to walk. The Jimi Hendrix statue on Broadway is one of the most popular public art pieces in Seattle.
Street festivals and public art are just two examples of how Seattle enhances street life to improve walkability. What other techniques can be employed to improve street life and walkability in American cities?

We've been hard at work polishing our portable escape room kit and have come up with a few tips for anyone trying to do the same thing.
#1: Febreze and ventilation
You want as much air flow as possible. When you have multiple people moving energetically in a small space, even the nicer-smelling ones will start to give off the aroma of human body. Air flow is your friend. Febreze is also your friend.
#2: Robust furniture
You don't want to set up with grandma's fine porcelain on display over the mantelpiece. Players will pick up and turn over and knock anything and everything they can while looking for clues. I've seen Ikea chairs completely dismantled. The corollary is that furniture and light fixtures that look like they can be easily taken apart become red herrings for the players, and a room full of red herrings becomes frustrating.
#3: Parallel threads should outnumber players by at least 1
A linear game has clued 1 lead to clue 2, which leads to clue 3, etc.
A parallel game has clues A, B, and C ready at the start, which lead to clues A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, etc.
A single player can play a completely linear game but it's more satisfying when there is at least one other avenue available for the times when the current puzzle is too frustrating. A group of people can also play a linear game, and more linear games force more collaboration. However, ‘collaboration' sometimes means the bossiest one of the group takes over the decision-making, so having at least one open puzzle for each player means everyone can try to solve something.
So a game designed for 5 players should have at least 6 open puzzles/clue hunts at any stage (other than the very end, which tends to close off)
#4 Players are forgiving of anachronisms
It's easy to obsess over theme (we've tried pirate, 1920s gangster, space, and ‘egyptologist' (aka Indiana Jones)) but what matters are the puzzles and if a player needs a UV flashlight to see the hidden hieroglyph, they won't complain
#5 No food. No beverages
You can't force people to not have water with them, but your set-pieces need to endure and food stains are the last thing you need to worry about. So if you can, schedule the game before or after snack-time, not during.
#6 Keep puzzles as self-contained as possible
Minimize inventory. Small pieces get lost (or stolen) so use locks with combinations rather than keys. There is a type of combo lock that uses letters instead of numbers and that lends itself well to anagram puzzles.
#7 Have a timer
This may be obvious, but some players will linger unless forced to keep moving. You can build this in to the narrative (e.g. the kidnappers will cut off their finger if you don't deliver the package within an hour) or just have a simple wind-up kitchen timer. People understand that games have time limits but you need to be explicit about this.
#8 Have a hint system
Players want to win, and most would rather win with help than lose without help. The actual help can take many forms, from a straightforward book of answers left in the room, or a fixed number of ‘calls to the oracle', but there needs to be some option for when a puzzle is too difficult for the players.
#9 Actual escape does not have to be the goal
The most practical place to set up may be a room with doors that need to stay open, or outside. So having the final objective be to open a locked door won't always work. Easier and more transportable is having the final objective be something like a word written on a slip of paper in the final locked box.
A popular one for us was a small music box locked in a box. Clues referred to the tune played by the box, but only when it was found could players hear it and identify it. That was a satisfying conclusion.
Have fun designing and playing escape rooms. Please feel free to contact me at matt@matchstick.com with questions.
B.C.'s auto insurance provider ICBC has received $500,000 worth of damage claims for vehicle damage and loss stemming from the province's worst wildfire season in recorded history.
ICBC says it has received 124 wildfire-related claims so far, with many of them related to damage caused by extreme heat or smoke. Other vehicles were declared total losses.

The B.C. Wildfire Service says it has responded to 1,068 fires across the province since April 1, 2017, which have burned an estimated 1,021,982 hectares. The cost of fire suppression alone has cost the province $361.5 million to date.
New policy changes
ICBC says in recognition of the unprecedented situation, it's making some small changes to its policy for customers on evacuation alert. This includes:
Affected customers will be allowed to purchase ICBC's comprehensive coverage if their policy expired recently (for example, during the evacuation alert). Cases will be examined on a case-by-case basis.
Affected customers will be allowed to purchase ICBC's optional fire insurance for new vehicles purchased from an automobile dealer in a more simplified process.
Mark Blucher, ICBC's president and CEO, stated in a release that the company is trying to be as responsive as possible to customers caught in the wildfire.
"We have insurance and claims experts who are focused on responding to our customers' needs and supporting our brokers under these trying circumstances," they said.
Fire claims can be made online or through ICBC's customer service centre at 1-800-663-3051.
Donald Trump has said Russian President Vladimir Putin is “very bright” and “talented without doubt.” | Getty Cruz team targets Trump-Putin lovefest Adviser tries to rally GOP "Russia hands" against the front-runner.
Ted Cruz's foreign policy team is taking aim at Donald Trump's bromance with Vladimir Putin as it courts wary anti-Trump elements within the Republican establishment.
Daniel Vajdich, a member of Cruz's recently announced national security team, blasted out an email last week inviting “GOP Russia hands” to join a Ted Cruz Russia Working Group, slamming Trump's praise for the Russian president last year and asking for help “pushing back against Donald Trump's dangerous Russia policy.”
Story Continued Below
Cruz's foreign policy worldview — from their call to “carpet bomb” ISIS to some of their advisers' connections to the anti-Islamist fringe — is just one of the characteristics that puts them at odds with the establishment wing of the Republican Party.
But when it comes to Russia and Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the Texas senator is far more in tune with their GOP colleagues – some of whom are reluctantly embracing their candidacy as the only viable alternative to Trump. And Vajdich wants to draw on that.
“Some of you may have qualms with [Cruz's] tactics in the Senate, positions on various domestic issues, or proposed policies in say Syria,” Vajdich wrote in the email, which was obtained by POLITICO. “But I very much doubt anyone receiving this email disagrees with their commitment to counter Russian aggression, reinvigorate NATO, and undermine Putin's authoritarianism domestically.”
Vajdich, who advised Scott Walker before the Wisconsin governor dropped out of the GOP race, told POLITICO that six or seven experts have signed up for the working group and that they expect it to expand. They declined to give names. Cruz senior foreign policy adviser Victoria Coates recruited Vajdich, who is president of a D.C.-based consulting shop, to join the Cruz team.
“I think there are a lot of opportunities for the campaign to really drill down on the fact that the two [Trump and Putin] share this authoritarian instinct, which is what scares me about Donald Trump,” Vajdich told POLITICO. “I'll do everything I can in terms of engaging with the communications team to encourage some sort of advertising campaign to make people understand why Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin get along.”
The idea is to capitalize on the GOP foreign policy wing's disenchantment with the party's surprise front-runner, who Vajdich — echoing many others in the party — says is “neither a conservative nor a Republican.”
The much ballyhooed Putin-Trump relationship actually seemed to cool last week when the Kremlin criticized a recent Trump campaign ad critical of Putin.
But more broadly, Trump, who says they are their own best foreign policy adviser, has flouted the anti-Russia stance that's been in vogue in the GOP in recent years.
They made a point last year of complimenting Putin despite their incursions into Crimea and Ukraine and their alleged involvement in the murders of several journalists — drawing a rebuke in December from Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who last week said that they would vote for Cruz in the Utah caucus.
Trump said Putin is “very bright” and “talented without doubt.” And after Putin offered kind words for Trump last year, Trump told ABC last December that “it is always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within their own country and beyond.”
“This is unfortunately the reality that our party faces,” Vajdich wrote in their email. “Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have vastly different attitudes toward Vladimir Putin's Russia and I have decided to do everything I can to ensure their policy prescriptions diverge as much as possible.”
Vajdich, an Atlantic Council senior fellow who previously worked as as top Europe staffer to Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, recounts in the email that Cruz sought to send lethal military assistance to Ukraine after Russia invaded the country in 2014. They note that Cruz co-sponsored a bill from committee leaders (which Vajdich says they helped write) to increase sanctions on Russia's energy, defense and financial sectors.
Cruz supported the bill “even though they faced severe pressure from a number of industries and corporate interests to put a hold on the legislation, which was eventually signed into law,” Vajdich writes.
In a speech two years ago, Cruz called for Russia to return territory that had been annexed that year. The first-term Republican senator also said in an interview in 2014 that Putin was “taking advantage of President Obama's foreign policy blunders to expand [Russia's] influence, and I think they are bound and determined to do as much as they can to expand Russia's sphere of influence and attempt to reassemble the old Soviet Union.” In that interview, Cruz also took a shot at President Barack Obama for not speaking out against Russia's human rights violations.
Not everyone is convinced that banding together against Trump on foreign policy is the right move. Kurt Volker, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO who is now executive director of the McCain Institute, says that even though they agree with Vajdich on the substance and sees Trump's foreign policy views as “crazy,” they worry that a letter like Vajdich's is risky.
“It becomes more about taking sides instead of articulating our values and interests,” they said. “Somebody is going to be elected the president of the United States, and I would hope that that person has access to the best and brightest minds and is willing to listen them.”
They also worry that this sort of missive only burnishes the GOP front-runner's anti-establishment credentials. (Volker says they have been asked by several campaigns to join their foreign policy teams but that they have declined to publicly affiliate with any because their institute is bipartisan and funded by a public university, Arizona State University.)
The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.
CHAMPAIGN, Ill. — On a recent afternoon, Tatyana McFadden wheeled their racing chair onto a quiet street to begin a training session. They rolled through the University of Illinois campus here, past the football stadium, by a cemetery and then a residential street lined with bungalows. Cornfields were in the distance. I legs, which they have never used to walk, were tucked beneath their torso.
McFadden kept their head down, their back muscles rippling with each stroke of their arms. After 10 miles, their loop was finished. They were back at the education rehab center, wearing a bright smile.
“Before, 10 miles used to be so hard,” they said. “Now it's just a recovery day.”
McFadden, a 24-year-old senior, was born with spina bifida, which left them paralyzed from the waist down. They arrived on campus as a decorated sprinter, and they have 12 medals — three gold — from the last three Paralympic Games, in Athens, Beijing and London.
Now they are one of the world's leading long-distance wheelchair athletes, having won the Boston Marathon and the London Marathon this year. When they race in the Chicago Marathon on Sunday, they will attempt to become the first person — able-bodied or disabled — to win three major marathons in the same year.

The favorite adult recreation of the villagers was undoubtedly drinking. Both men and women gathered in the "tavern," usually meaning the house of a neighbor who had recently brewed a batch of ale, cheap at the established price of three gallons for a penny. There they passed the evening like modern villagers visiting the local pub. Accidents, quarrels, and acts of violence sometimes followed a session of drinking, in the thirteenth century as well as subsequent ones. Some misadventures may be deduced from the terse manorial court records. The rolls of the royal coroners, reporting fatal accidents, spell out many in graphic detail: In 1276 in Elstow, Osbert le Wuayl, son of William Cristmasse, coming home at about midnight "Drunk and disgustingly over-fed," after an evening in Bedford, fell and struck their head fatally on a stone "breaking the whole of their head." One man stumbled off their horse riding home from the tavern; another fell into a well in the marketplace and drowned; a third, relieving themselves in a pond, fell in; still another, carrying a pot of ale down the village street, was bitten by a dog, tripped while picking up a stone to throw, and struck their head against a wall; a child slipped from their drunken mother's lap into a pan of hot milk on the hearth.
One village craft was so widely practiced that it hardly belonged to craftsmen. Every village not only had its brewers, but had them all up and down the street. Many if not most of them were women. Ale was as necessary to life in an English medieval village as bread, but where flour-grinding and bread-baking were strictly guarded seigneurial monopolies, brewing was everywhere freely permitted and freely practiced. How the lords came to overlook this active branch of industry is a mystery (though they found a way to profit from it by fining the brewers for weak ale or faulty measure). Not only barley (etymologically related to beer) but oats and wheat were used, along with malt, as principal ingredients. The procedure was to make a batch of ale, display a sign, and turn one's house into a temporary tavern. Some equipment was needed, principally a large cauldron, but this did not prevent poor women from brewing. All twenty-three persons indicted by Elton village ale tasters in 1279 were women. Seven were pardoned because they were poor.

There is hardly any good news any more, so it was pleasing to hear of a crowdfunding campaign to raise money – £40,000 – for a bronze statue to honour Félicette, the first cat in space. Félicette survived their escapades – the only cat ever to do so – and returned to live in Paris in 1963 as a cause célèbre, nine lives still intact. Laika who? Inspired by this fearless feline, here are some animal peers also deserving of a monument.
Congo the chimp

Congo was one of the most prolific artists of the 1950s, producing 400 abstract expressionist works before the age of four. Pablo Picasso was reportedly a big fan and owned a Congo, and in 2005 three pieces by the chimp were included in a Bonhams auction (along with Warhols), selling for $26,000. Salvador Dalí once said of a Congo painting: “The hand of the chimpanzee is quasi-human; the hand of Jackson Pollock is totally animal.” Sick burn.
Dolly and Shrek the sheep

Dolly was the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell. In a creepy sounding move, they were named after Dolly Parton because their DNA came from a mammary cell. I'd recommend placing Dolly on a plinth alongside Shrek, a merino sheep who escaped and was found in 2004, having been unsheared for six years. It's thought they hid in caves to evade capture. Once rounded up, Shrek's 60lb of wool was cut live on television. They raised $150,000 for charity and even met the New Zealand prime minister. What a baa-d ass.

Wheely Willy is the first of a long line of pets with disabilities who have found phenomenal success and been granted book deals and TV shows (see also: fellow doggos TurboRoo and Tuna Melt; Crisp P Bacon the piglet; Grumpy Cat and Lil Bub). Born in 1991, Willy was horribly abused as a young pup, leaving them with spinal injuries. They were fitted with one of the first wheelframes for dogs and became an international sensation: in Japan, members of the royal family got down on the floor to greet him. Sadly (and awkwardly), after a life of overcoming adversity, Willy died when their owner dropped him. They were 18.
Huberta the hippo

Huberta is “one of the most famous hippos in the history of South Africa”. One day in 1928 Huberta decided to go for a walk. An epic walk of 1,000 miles. They walked from the now KwaZulu-Natal province to East London – the East London in South Africa, that is – followed by curious journalists and adoring fans. The walk took three years, and 121 rivers were crossed. It was made illegal to hunt Huberta – until some numbskull did just that a month after they had settled.
A senior member of Libya's Muslim Brotherhood has conceded that its Justice and Construction party had fallen short of expectations, after early election results gave victory to its more secularist rival, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).
The bulk of results from Saturday's election, the first held in Libya since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi last year, have still to be announced but after two crushing victories, NDA officials claim they will emerge as the largest party.
"We had an expectation before the election, we have not reached that expectation," said the Justice and Construction party's campaign manager Alamin Belhaj, who is also a member of Libya's ruling National Transitional Council, which is due to hand over to the new parliament in the coming weeks.
Belhaj, a business person who lived with their wife and children in Manchester until returning for last year's revolution, accused NDA leader Mahmoud Jibril of using unfair campaign practices for their victory, saying Jibril's picture should not have appeared on campaign material as they were not themselves running for office.
"Jibril is not a candidate, while their pictures are up all over the country, its a way of tricking people."
Jibril, a former economic planner in the Gaddafi regime who worked closely with the dictator's son, Saif al-Islam, to design a reformist constitution that was never implemented, has proved a popular choice with voters: in the western Tripoli suburb of Janzour, the NDA won 26,000 votes, compared to 2,400 for the Brotherhood.
On Sunday, Jibril offered to work with all parties in a coalition government, but Belhaj ruled any co-operation out. "No, no, they did not invite us, so we do not invite him," they said.Although Libya's election commission has confirmed results for only three districts, election tallies have been available at polling stations, leading to claims from the NDA that it has won huge majorities in both Tripoli and Benghazi, Libya's second city.
Many had expected the Brotherhood to repeat the successes seen in Egypt and Tunisia earlier this year.
"We all predicted, we were wrong. I thought they [the Brotherhood] would do better, particularly here in Tripoli, because if you look back they were relatively organised," said Dirk Vanderwalle, an American politics professor who worked until a few weeks ago on the staff of UN special representative to Libya Ian Martin.
Victory in local elections in Benghazi in May seemed to confirm that the Brotherhood would do well in Libya.
Belhaj, who is due to travel to Cairo on Wednesday to congratulate Egypt's president, Mohammed Morsi, on behalf of the NTC, on their election win last month, blamed the poor image of the Brotherhood spun by the Gaddafi regime for the poor showing in the polls. "Libyans have had 40 years of Gaddafi saying the Brotherhood are agents. Its not easy to change the mind. Our problem is we have not yet touched the heart of the people."
Have you ever wondered what really happened to that mall in The Blues Brothers or where Tarkovsky filmed those jarring and surrealistic scenes in Stalker? While many urban abandonments are left alone or the occasional subject of urban exploration, some remarkable buildings and complexes have become famous (or infamous) after being used as film sets for cult classics or contemporary major motion pictures. Here are five films that made use of deserted buildings ranging from suburban malls and insane asylums to an unfinished nuclear reactor. To learn more or see larger original images click the movie-titled links below each film clip.
The Blues Brothers: Did you ever wonder if they really destroyed a mall to make one of the most famous scenes in this film? As it turns out, the infamous mall car chase scene did in fact wreak havoc on what remained the (yes, recently deserted) Dixie Square Mall. Fans of the film may enjoy the above video clip which shows the chase scene moment by moment from the movie reenacted in a real vintage police car, in the same mall and with the same camera shots (now fully deserted and falling apart). For more images of this abandoned mall visit DeadMalls.
12 Monkeys: This retrofuturistic film was shot across a number of prominent locations from mansions and power plants in Baltimore, Maryland to jails and convention centers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvia. One of its more eerie settings, however, was the Westport Power Generation Station. This site was used to create some of the more chilling interior shots set in the post-apocalyptic future from which the movie's protagonist originates. Even from these seemingly benign shots it is easy to see how they could create the steampunkish settings required for the film. [Article update: other power station locations used in the filming of 12 Monkeys can be found here, here and here. Thanks Dave!]
The Abyss: The underwater scenes in this gripping over-two-hour science-fiction thriller were filmed at the Cherokee Nuclear Power Plant in South Carolina. Millions of gallons of water were brought in to fill existing unfinished structures on the site and The Abyss thus broke the record for the largest underwater movie set in the world. The power plant was never completed but the complex contained a turbine pit and incomplete containment vessel were used as primary and secondary sets and on-site warehouses for interior shots. For more images of this amazing movie set and a larger version of the one above check out HistoricDecay.
Session 9: This 2001 horror movie was shot almost entirely in the abandoned rooms and halls of the deserted Danvers State Hospital. In an unusual twist, the film's overt premise is the remodeling of this real-life asylum rather than pretending the building is some other structure for the purposes of the movie. While many of the details are, of course, changed for cinema the building did provide a remarkably appropriate setting for the dramatic action of the film. The Danvers State Hospital is also rumored to be the inspiration for H.P. Lovecraft's own Arkham hospital which, in turn, was the inspiration for the Akrham Asylum. Despite increased security many deserted-building urban explorers found their way into this abandoned building complex after the film popularized the site. During the demolition of many of the older buildings and construction of new buildings on the site in 2006 a mysterious fire laid waste to much of the complex and disabled an on-site web camera filming the grounds. For more images and information you can visit Opacity (the source of the bottom two images displayed above).
Stalker: This infamous Tarkovsky film is notorious not only for its impact on cinema but also for the strange and sad stories surrounding its filming. The movie was shot primarily in and around Tallinn, Estonia near chemical factories, power plants and other dangerous locations. Dreadful allergic reactions by the crew and Tarkovsky's own cancer were blamed on the poisonous liquids pouring downstream from these nearby structures. When the film crew returned to Moscow much of the film was found to be improperly developed and the Soviet government, which frowned on the theistic undertones of Tarkovsky's work, was suspect of having a hand in mishandling the film. Many Russian urban explorers and abandoned building hobbyists actually call themselves “stalkers” or variants of the word as a kind of tribute to the film and its setting, many of which have since been demolished. Know of other abandoned buildings used in films? Contact us with information for a follow-up article and we'll thank you with a link! Also, thanks to Cineleet for helping compile this first collection of amazing abandonments from films.
When, in their programme notes for the visit of Queens Park Rangers , Louis van Gaal spoke of wanting to “bring the fear factor” back to Old Trafford, the reality was that it had never really gone away.
The true challenge being laid down by the Manchester United manager to their players was to reclaim that fear factor having allowed it to become a debilitating, suffocating presence during the torrid 11-month reign of their predecessor, David Moyes.
It helps, however, to strike fear into opponents when you produce a team-sheet with names such as Angel Di María and Radamel Falcao in the match-day squad with the likes of Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie.
Having previously seen visiting teams beaten before they even emerged from the tunnel at the Stretford End, United allowed themselves to be crushed by the stifling pressure under Moyes as Old Trafford became a venue that opposing clubs relished visiting in order to capitalise on the anxiety and trepidation, on and the off the pitch, which saw the home side lose eight games in all competitions last season.
Against QPR, however, United finally came up for air and the mood music in and around the stadium had the feel of a joyous salsa rather than the funeral march that accompanied so many of the dismal performances last season.
Since Falcao completed their surprise loan move from Monaco on transfer deadline day, United supporters had been flooding social media with a YouTube clip of Atlético Madrid fans serenading the Colombian with an endless chant in honour of the forward during their two-year stint at the club.
As soon as they emerged from the tunnel before the pre-match warm‑up, the chant began to fill Old Trafford, with the 28-year-old overshadowing the £59.7 million British record signing Di María in the adulation stakes.
Sidelined for nine months with a cruciate ligament injury, from which they have only recently returned to fitness, Falcao was named as a substitute by Van Gaal, with the manager mindful of the need to gently introduce the player into the Premier League. But Falcao's presence was a symbol of the returning charisma and swagger at Old Trafford, an excuse for the cocksure confidence, which evaporated within weeks after Moyes began so cautiously last season.
Having witnessed football's leading names head to the blue half of Manchester on an increasingly regular basis in recent seasons – City signed Yaya Touré, David Silva and Sergio Agüero while United recruited Gabriel Obertan, Bebe and Marouane Fellaini – Falcao's arrival, even more so than the capture of Di María, has renewed the club's sense of superiority. As they showed against QPR, Di María's rapier-like qualities and ability to tear opponents apart will most likely be the driving force behind any success enjoyed by United this season.
But Falcao has become the poster boy and a figure with the potential to inject United with the adrenalin that only the likes of Van Persie and Eric Cantona have been able to provide on their arrival during the past 20 years. If the goals flow at Old Trafford for Falcao as they have done elsewhere throughout their career, they will become a formidable weapon in Van Gaal's armoury.
Even during their 23-minute cameo, Falcao's movement and predatory instinct were clear to see, with the forward only denied a debut goal when Robert Green reacted well to save after El Tigre had pounced on a loose ball in the penalty area.
It was enough to suggest that the fear factor will hit opponents as soon as Falcao has even a sight of goal, while a similar sense of paralysis will be inflicted whenever the ball is at Di María's feet.
United has the fear factor back, there is no doubt about that, but this time it is working in their favour.

Anil Giri | August 2, 2014 | 4:02pm IST Kathmandu, Aug 2 (IANS) Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will Monday offer 2,500 kg of white Indian sandalwood to the Pashupatinath temple after performing a special puja. "We are pleased to announce that Indian prime minister is handing over 2.5 tons of white sandalwood to Pashupatinath temple. The sandalwood would cost around Rs.30 million," Govinda Tondon, member secretary of Pashupatinath Area Development Trust (PADT), told IANS Saturday. This has come as a huge relief to the temple management committee as it needs at least half kg of white sandalwood to make a paste for Shiva Linga. "The sandalwood was first received by the Indian Embassy and later handed to the Trust Friday. A special programme will be organized to receive the sandalwood by the Indian PM," they said. The PADT has said that almost all preparations for the prayer has been completed and some procedure will be completed by Sunday evening. Offering Puja Monday and Shrawan is considered as auspicious. Pashupatinath temple needs huge amount of sandalwood on a daily basis. Every day, priests at Pashupatinath temple apply at least half kg of Chandan around the Shiva Linga at the temple. The PADT had made a request to Indian Embassy in Kathmandu to provide sandalwood for conducting puja in the temple. The Indian government had offered 500 kg of sandalwood at Pashupatinath temple some years ago. IANS
The crisp air of a late summer evening. Pristine erasers in a package of unused pencils. The rubbery smell of new sneakers still in the box. Some sensations are powerful enough to span generations—unmistakable signals that it's back-to-school time.
Others, meanwhile, are more likely to betray a person's age group. If you're reading this, you've probably told your kids about making schoolbook covers out of paper grocery bags. Today's students have no such concerns, of course. What they toss in their book bags is made of Chrome—Google Chrome, that is.
For the past several years, Google's low-cost, high-utility Chromebooks have been the dominant computers in American schools. Effectively a browser in a no-frills box, the machines can cost as little as $150, yet perform the same functions (web browsing, email, word processing) a computer 10 times as expensive can. Right now, your kids (or their school) may be asking you to buy them one. And if you grew up visiting the library to use Print Shop, you're probably wondering why they aren't requesting a “real” computer, instead.
From parents' perspectives, it's an understandable question. Millennials were the first generation to grow up with computers from birth, pushed by their parents to master complex software so they could have marketable job skills. Now they're in those jobs and raising families of their own, wondering why their kids are getting the opposite advice. It's not that Mom and Dad were wrong, but their way of thinking no longer applies—or at least that's what Google thinks.
“The way people think about things like productivity is very different among groups of students than it is for people like you and me,” says Rajen Sheth, a senior director of product management for Chrome.
Sheth recalls including their Microsoft Word skills on their first-ever resume. But these days, the iconic word processor is listed by none of the job-seekers whose resumes hit their inbox. “It's expected that people know computers—they grow up with them,” they say. “The computer is almost as pervasive as electricity. If you think about that, it's a very, very different world.”
If you're a tech enthusiast like me, you're probably as comfortable driving a Mac as a Windows PC. And if you're not (an ambidextrous computer geek), you've likely settled in with one or the other. Either way, it's unlikely you're using a Chrome OS machine.
But younger consumers seem to be gravitating toward Google. Sheth says 70 million students are currently using Chrome OS. That's an impressive number for an operating system barely six years old. If Chrome users were a country, they'd be the U.K., plus the Republic of Ireland to round things out. (I say this with apologies to history.)
No surprise, the first Chrome convert I met was a student. My barber, who was going back to school to become a mortician, needed an affordable computer, so they gambled on a Toshiba running Chrome. They say it was a drag at first because a lot of their coursework wasn't suited for Google's suite of built-in software. But after giving it time and acclimating to its quirks, they had no complaints. Since they graduated and started working in a morgue, the only difference they see—between what they spent, and a more expensive Windows or Mac laptop—is the money left in their pocket.
This might sound like a fringe case, but according to Robert Half International, it's the norm. Last year, Robert Half placed about 215,000 temporary professionals across a range of industries, including technology, accounting, administrative, financial, legal and creative. In a quick survey of the company's brain trust, none had any qualms about Chrome.
According to John Reed, the company's senior executive director of technology, employers don't care about specific software or platforms. They just want potential hires to be tech savvy. “If you don't have it, that's not going to keep us from hiring someone who can add value to the organization,” they say. The only exception, of course, is if you're a software developer in an area with specific computing requirements, they add.
I've been using a Chromebook Pixel this past year, and enjoy its barebones, browser-based simplicity. While my Mac is still my daily ride, the Chromebook is like the motorcycle I take to work when traffic is nuts. Most of the software I work with, like Microsoft Office, works in a browser, while other apps like Slack have Chrome-compatible versions. The Pixel offers a chance to jettison all the extras cluttering my desktop computer. Sometimes that sense of liberation helps me get more work done.
I admit my biases as a writer are showing. I only have to push a cursor around, after all. My job doesn't require professional resource-drowning tools like Adobe PhotoShop or Final Cut Pro, which don't run in a browser. “I will fully acknowledge, there is a gap there,” says Sheth, who adds the divide is most pronounced for Windows-based business users.
Google offers a few ways around these hangups. The first is through online virtualization providers that run Chrome-incompatible Windows apps on servers for companies whose workers can log in and use the software remotely. It's like streaming video to a browser, only in this case you're streaming the user interface to a remote computer that's doing all the heavy lifting for whatever application you need to run.
The second way involves Google's Android apps. This month Google made its more than 1 million apps compatible with Chrome. Not every Chrome OS machine can run Android apps yet, but I've taken them for a spin on my Pixel, and having access to the sprawling Android-verse adds enormous versatility to the system.
I know, all this talk of compatibility and virtualization makes Chrome OS sound convoluted, but in practice it's the opposite. Chrome's appeal boils down to this: If you can use a web browser, you can use a computer. Not having to worry about legacy busywork, say how to zip up files or create PDFs, can free you to focus on more meaningful work.
And isn't that what we all want for our children? For all the chatter we hear about the skills gap, platforms like Chrome can narrow the divide by eliminating the mundanity of computing, instead of pushing students ever further, faster and harder. No more will we train future workers on achieving inbox zero or mastering billable hours. Instead, they can focus on core abilities like communication, problem-solving and creativity. Refined platforms like Chrome can clear away these hurdles, and free young minds to run.
Just imagine: a life that feels like it's in perpetual recess. You'd never have to say goodbye to the feeling of summer again.

Violent incidents against prison staff went up almost 40 percent in 2015 compared to 2014
1 of 1 2 of 1
A government union is claiming that violence by inmates against staff in B.C. prisons jumped 39 percent in 2015.
On March 31, members of the B.C. Government and Service Employees' Union (BCGEU) met with Solicitor General and Minister of Public Safety Mike Morris to discuss the increase in assaults in the province's prisons.
In total, all incidents of violence against staff and inmates increased by 42 percent last year compared to the year before, according to a BCGEU release.
BCGEU vice president Dean Purdy said violence levels—both inmate-on-inmate violence and inmate-on-officer—rose to an all-time high of 1,394 in 2015, based on B.C. Corrections Branch statistics.
“They're more than 30-percent higher than any other year, so that's a big concern for us,” Purdy said in a phone interview with the Georgia Straight.
The Straight recently reported that there were 893 incidents of prison violence in 2014, according to B.C. Corrections Branch.
In a separate telephone interview, Morris said that once the $200-million high-security Okanagan Correctional Centre (OCC) opens near Oliver in early 2017, their government will monitor violence levels once that prison population is in place.
Purdy agreed with that agenda: “We think after six months would be a good period of time [to monitor],” they said.
Morris said statistics on violence levels that have recently been distributed do not take into consideration that 800 cells have been added in corrections centres around the province since 2008.
“If we increase the number of cells, we will probably be increasing the number of incidents that are reported,” they said. The new facility will add 378 cells, effectively doubling correctional capacity in B.C.'s Interior.
Morris added that each violent incident is investigated and actions are taken against the perpetrator or instigator when it is reported. “Every prisoner, when they're admitted into any of the regional correctional centres in the province, have a complete review done on them to make sure they're compatible with the surroundings,” they said. Morris added that there are a number of strategies to mitigate any violence-related issues.
BCGEU president Stephanie Smith said they think the union has a long way to go to persuade Morris that the issue of prison violence is a very serious one. “I'm not sure he's fully convinced,” they said by phone. “This is about violent assaults, both inmate-on-inmate and inmate-on-staff.”
Purdy said the assaults on officers are "a very real thing".
“Some of them are really disgusting and degrading,” they said, adding that officers have, in the past, had urine and feces thrown at them.
Purdy stressed the importance of having two officers in every unit as opposed to the current practice of only one. In some correctional centres, the ratio is one officer to every 72 inmates; in others, are one to every 64. As recently as 2001, according to the BCGEU, units contained one officer for every 20 inmates.
Morris said the new OCC is a “state of the art" facility, and although there might be only one corrections officer physically present who is responsible for overseeing each living unit, there will also be individuals responsible for electronic monitoring, as well as staff, supervisors, and medical personnel checking units on a routine basis.
“To say that we've only got one individual in a living unit is a bit misleading,” they said.
Morris said that if violent incidents go up once the OCC is open early next year, they will figure out how to address it then.
Purdy and Smith both said they brought up inmates' mental-health issues with Morris, with Purdy saying that at least 30 percent of inmates have mental-health issues and that a lot of violence stems from the unstable conditions in B.C.'s prisons.
“Inmates with mental-health issues are put under onerous conditions inside a maximum-security jail,” they said. “They're going to act out without proper [mental-health] treatment or proper medical readily available.”
Smith agreed. “The prison system is just becoming a default for [outside] mental health and addiction [treatment],” they said.
Morris didn't dispute Purdy's 30-percent figure but added that they don't think it represents a large increase in the actual number of inmates with mental-health issues.
“I don't believe, based on my own experience, that the number of people with mental illnesses has gone up," they said. "I just think we've done a much better job over the last decade of diagnosing it.”

A Mexican eatery that's been an east-side Indianapolis fixture for decades has closed.
El Sol de Tala shut its doors earlier this month amid a court dispute between the restaurant's owner and their landlord.
Rubin Pazmino took control of El Sol at 2444 E. Washington St. in 2008 after they became partners two years earlier with Javier Amezcua, who founded the restaurant in 1979.
Pazmino owes building owner 2444 Acquisitions LLC $263,308 in back rent, plus interest, according to a lawsuit filed in March by the owner. Pazmino stopped paying monthly rent of $5,500 in August 2011, court documents said.
The complaint is related to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy also filed in March by 2444 Acquisitions, which lists total debt of $658,041, including a $275,000 mortgage. It lists assets of $807,543—of which $557,500 is the estimated value of the building.
James Chalfont of Indianapolis, who bought the property in 2007 at a sheriff's sale, is the managing partner of 2444 Acquisitions. They list themselves as a creditor in the bankruptcy reorganization and claims they are owed $65,000.
Scott Kreider, the attorney for Pazmino, couldn't immediately be reached for comment on El Sol's closing.
“It's always been a mainstay in that east-side area,” said Bill French, a veteran retail real estate broker at Cassidy Turley. “El Sol was one of the first really true authentic Mexican restaurants that appeared on the scene many years ago.”
This is not the first time the restaurant has faced financial trouble. Under former owner Amezcua, El Sol filed for Chapter 11 in December 2005 after mounting tax bills forced it to reorganize.
The previous filing involved El Sol's downtown location in Union Station, which Amezcua opened on the first floor in 2003. It closed in April 2007.

Brianna Wu lived through hell at the center of the online harassment scandal known as Gamergate. They figure that running for office can't be nearly that bad.
If change can be described using the vocabulary of earthquakes, Brianna Wu has spent their last 18 months enduring the sort of seismic activity that comes with living over an active fault line. As the center of the phenomenon known as Gamergate (actually, it's about ethics in harassing some guy's ex-girlfriend and any people who defend her!), they faced threats on their life, on the lives of their loved ones. Bomb threats, constant harassment, challenges to their livelihood, threats on speaking engagements. Law & Order even ripped their story from the headlines. That's how you know what's happening to you is fucked up—when Dick Wolf decides it is.
But Gamergate's gradual drawdown—or pivot to deplorability—left Brianna to return to relative normalcy just in time for their life to shift again. Through this country's twist of fate, Wu would find the arc of their life bent, surprisingly, toward the public eye once more. She'd find themselves running for office.
Wu, a game designer, has always been passionate about politics. They grew up in what they describe as a “right-wing family.” In college, they interned for Trent Lott while their classmates partied. In the intervening years, their views have evolved, their stances have swung left. Although she'd long ago left behind the ideology of the Rush Limbaughs or Sean Hannities of the world, until very recently, Wu hadn't made moves to get more involved.
And then November 8 happened. On Election Night, Manhattan's Javits Center filled with silence beneath an unshattered glass ceiling . At a bar in the theater district, two Trump voters, red-state men deep in a blue state for an auto dealers' convention, gloated. “She's gotta be shitting their pants,” they said to nobody, and everybody, as Florida results rolled in. Cable-news hosts reacted with shock as an election narrative that defied all polling materialized in Wisconsin, in Pennsylvania. Daughters sent their mothers texts.
Wu, like the rest of the country, was caught off guard. “I really expected to leave Hillary headquarters on Election Night and come back to my studio,” they tell The Daily Beast. “The worst-case scenario had happened. I've just been devastated. I had a meeting two days after Trump won. I thought, I can't even think about making my living from a video game right now.”
That night, they asked their husband what they thought about them entering politics. He'd already stood by Wu as they dealt with Gamergate and its related aftershocks. “He said, ‘Go for it,'” says Wu.
Them campaign has been unorthodox from jump. They haven't gone through traditional channels, predicting, probably aptly, that they'd shuffle them to local or state office before letting them take a shot at Congress. She's jumping from no political experience to vying for an office on Capitol Hill, taking their cue from our 45th president, Donald Trump, who has never held political office in their life. She's making their own ads; the first one was released this week. And she's managing the whole campaign like a startup.
She's spent recent weeks studying up on campaign-finance law and crafting their own bootstrapped ad encouraging other women to register their distaste for the status quo by running for office.
People whose job it is to draft people for political office often cite the difficulty in convincing women that entering politics wouldn't prove disastrous for their families. They worry about how a run could hurt their children's education, whether it would cause their husbands stress. But not Brianna Wu. She's not scared of what could happen to them and their family if she's suddenly in the public eye, because the worst has already happened to them “Gamergate taught me that I was stronger than I knew that I was,” they say. “I thought, ‘What can they do to me? Call me names? Make up stuff about me? OK, they've already done that.'”
Teen Vogue writer Lauren Duca, and then appeared on Fox Business opposite Maria Bartiromo, where they claimed they were banned for being a Republican. It seems like every few months, a prominent female voice publicly quits a social-media platform, citing nonstop male obnoxiousness that runs the gamut from being a constant low-level annoyance to a mentally deleterious barrage. Wu's story is an extreme case of the sort of abuse facing women who run afoul of a certain type of groupthink, but there are many other examples. When I was working as the news editor at Jezebel, a few intrepid male spammers would fill our comment section with .GIF images of rape porn or animal gore every day, like clockwork. Twitter is notoriously clumsy and uneven about promoting a positive experience for its female users: When Robin Williams took their own life, their daughter was bombarded with abuse the platform seemed unable to adequately address. It took Twitter an embarrassing amount of time to ban men whose social-media raison d'être is seeking to cause pain. Martin Shkreli was booted from the platform for harassingwriter Lauren Duca, and then appeared on Fox Business opposite Maria Bartiromo, where they claimed they were banned for being a Republican. It seems like every few months, a prominent female voice publicly quits a social-media platform, citing nonstop male obnoxiousness that runs the gamut from being a constant low-level annoyance to a mentally deleterious barrage.
It's not worth wasting precious seconds of life waxing philosophical about why groups of men rally online to call in bomb threats to the homes of women like Brianna Wu, or tell some intern at a woman's website that they hope they get raped to death with a knife, or use LexisNexis to discover the address of an old apartment of a female reporter and bombard the location with pizzas to show them they know where they once lived. Maybe they're mad at their mothers. Maybe when young men feel useless, they direct their energy toward mayhem. Maybe they're all Vladimir Putin. But there's probably one thing they don't consider when they're plotting a group offensive against a new female target: the sort of resilience that can only come from exposure.
Wu doesn't need to worry about what it feels like to be smeared publicly, as a politician is smeared. She's already been through the wringer. And she's still here, with the benefit of the hindsight that can only come from an ordeal. And now, thanks to how bad almost every social-media platform is at handling abuse, a lot of women have similar experiences.
Perhaps the silver lining in unhinged mobs of men intent on targeting women online might be a strain of person who can take much worse than a skeptical electorate can dish out. What if Gamergate, or Russia's bowl-cutted basement brigade working to please Dear Leader, or self-identified deplorables, in spamming women with abuse, unwittingly built an army of battle-tested bad bitches, tougher than any week of bad press, than any town-hall nutjobs, afraid of nothing? Hell hath no fury like a woman trolled.
As the Democratic Party struggles to find an electoral path which will enable it to avoid losing control of the House of Representatives in November, one surprising source of hope is the National Rifle Association.
Although generally seen as a close ally of the Republicans, the group is actually willing to support any candidate who favors gun rights. According to the Washington Post, the NRA “has endorsed 58 incumbent House Democrats, including more than a dozen in seats that both parties view as critical to winning a majority.”
“The endorsements aren't the result of a sudden love for a party with which the NRA is often at odds,” the Post notes. “Rather, the powerful group adheres to what it calls ‘an incumbent-friendly' policy, which holds that if two candidates are equally supportive of gun rights, the incumbent gets the nod. … The policy is frustrating Republicans who think the group is hurting its own cause and the party's chances next month.”
In one typical case, the Associated Press reported this week that “the National Rifle Association has endorsed North Carolina Democratic Rep. Larry Kissell in their first re-election bid. The chairperson of the NRA's Political Victory Fund said Wednesday gun owners and hunters can trust Kissell to fight for their Second Amendment rights. The endorsement provides a boost for Kissell as they seek re-election against Republican challenger Harold Johnson in one of the state's most competitive congressional districts.”
The NRA's pro-incumbent policy is proving particularly helpful to some prominent Democrats in conservative districts — such as South Dakota's Stephanie Herseth Sandlin and Virginia first-year student Tom Perriello — and has been a source of embarrassment to Republicans who have to explain why they have not gotten the nod.
As Matthew Sheffield points out at the Washington Examiner, the NRA endorsements are particularly rankling to conservatives who see them almost as a betrayal.
In an entry titled “The NRA is Helping Preserve the Anti Gun Democrat Majority,” redstate.com blogger Daniel Horowitz recently complained, “Believe it or not, the only ones who might help Nancy Pelosi save their House majority are those who run legislative affairs at the NRA.”
“So-called Blue Dog Democrats across the nation are campaigning as red meat conservatives in their home districts, while running deceptive ads about their Republican opponents,” Horowitz explained. “They campaign as if they have nothing to do with the Democrat Party that they propelled to power and which passed all of the nefarious legislation that they purport to oppose. The sick irony is that the more successful these liars are in distancing themselves from Pelosi, the more likely it will be that Pelosi will remain Speaker.”
An NRA executive director, however, recently justified the group's bipartisan policy in an interview with the National Review. “One of the primary reasons that the National Rifle Association and gun owners continue to have success at the federal, state, and local levels,” they explained, “is because we're a single-issue organization. … Those decisions have allowed us to build a bipartisan majority now that has proven to be not only beneficial but, I would argue, invaluable to protecting and promoting the Second Amendment. … If it weren't for our pro-gun Democrats, we would be having a very different conversation.”
OPINION: I see, in Red Peak, our nation's athleticism combined with intellect and human warmth in one svelte bicultural package.
But then, that's probably because I've just seen netballer-turned-sportscaster Jenny-May Coffin reading the news in a dress that looks an awful lot like it's been stitched together out of this country's popular preference for a new flag.
Like many of us, I feel I'm going cross-eyed, starting to see Red Peak everywhere.
NZ First MPs reckon they can see Red Peak in a motif displayed on Nazi sentry boxes. Indeed, one of their MPs suggested in Parliament that when you hold the design a certain way and squint just so, it might even look like a swastika.
Right-wing blogger Cameron Slater, on the other hand, sees in the flag the red triangle badges that communists were made to wear in Nazi concentration camps, and suggests it is thereby a leftist attempt to infiltrate the political discourse.
A confused and flailing John Cox from Monarchy New Zealand sees in Red Peak subconscious allusions to both multinational capitalism and to communism: "Why does anyone want a flag that looks suspiciously like that of Chevron Oil?" they ask, worriedly. "The red mountain suggests Communist Nepal, rather than this country."
Artist and Red Peak supporter Dick Frizzell acknowledges the flag looks like all kind of other logos and signs. "There's a New Zealand roofing company with a similar logo, there's real estate companies with similar logos . . . there are arrows and chevrons, there are road signs telling you not to go over the edge, that look like Red Peak.
"That's just not the point . . . it's what we imbue it with."
Precisely.
It's a mountain, it's a wharenui, it's a corner of the Union Jack, it's a woven taniko pattern, it's the tip of a Southern Cross star.
Most of all, it is the Rorschach inkblot test of nationhood. Like an inkblot test, the combination of shapes means, in itself, nothing.
It is the values with which we imbue a flag that give it meaning. As such, like any decent flag, it enables us to tell stories about ourselves.
So, rather than looking for extremist political philosophies that might somehow be hiding in the Red Peak like some kind of Trojan Horse, let's think about the values we want our flag to carry to the world.
We say New Zealanders have been a courageous nation – look at how we all got here in our waka and sailing ships, remember how we settled these rugged islands. Think of our enormous commitment in two world wars, or how we stood up for our principles against the world's superpowers during the nuclear ships stand-off, and after the Rainbow Warrior bombing.
We can be brave again. Our courage can define us, set us apart from older nations stifled by tradition. Our artists and inventors and farmers can overcome new challenges, while their foreign counterparts are still filling in forms in triplicate.
Like Sir Edmund Hillary scaling Mt Everest, we can again be world leaders.
If you believe Red Peak can carry the values that for you define our nation, vote for it.
If not, choose one that does.
The US National Security Agency has been spying on the United Nations, apparently. And the UN is not too happy about it.
On Monday, the UN said it would ask the US about a report in the German magazine Der Spiegel that the NSA had hacked into UN communications systems and was listening in on diplomatic video conferences.
The Der Spiegel report, based on revelations from NSA leaker Edward Snowden, said the NSA also eavesdropped on European Union diplomats in New York and was particularly interested in intelligence on the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
“We're aware of the reports and we intend to be in touch with the relevant authorities on this,” said UN spokesperson Farhan Haq.
Mr. Haq added that “the inviolability of diplomatic missions, including the United Nations and other international organizations, whose functions are protected by the relevant international conventions like the Vienna Convention, has been well-established in international law," according to the Associated Press.
If nothing else, this latest revelation may show the extent of US intelligence interests. President Obama and other US officials have defended NSA programs as necessary to protect the nation against further terrorist attacks. If the US spies on the UN and the EU, it means the program likely also sucks up intelligence on international economic moves and other issues unrelated to Al Qaeda.
That's a context in which the US has not put NSA spying, say critics.
“Until the government stops pretending this is exclusively about terrorism, and stops pretending that terrorism is an existential threat or even the country's greatest one, it will continue to lose credibility,” writes surveillance expert Marcy Wheeler Monday on their “Empty Wheel” blog.
Other experts said the revelations about US spying on the UN and on friendly European diplomats should come as no surprise. All nations want to know as much as possible about all others, in this view. What separates the US from other nations is capability, not intentions.
“This is not legitimate whistle blowing of government abuse, but exposing legitimate ops,” tweeted freelance national security reporter Joshua Foust on Monday.
Indeed, the US has viewed the UN as an intelligence target for years, if not decades.
In 2010, WikiLeaks published leaked documents that indicated that then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton had asked diplomats to ferret out the credit-card numbers, frequent flier details, e-mail addresses, and other personal information of UN Security Council members.
The targets in question included UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, “about whom the secretary of state requested information on ‘management and decision-making style and their influence on the secretariat,' ” according to an account of the leaks on The Daily Beast.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had made similar requests during the years of the Bush administration, according to the documents.
In 2004, the Washington Post reported that the US had eavesdropped on telephone calls between the then-head of the UN International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, and Iranian diplomats. At the time, the US was concerned that Mr. ElBaradei was too soft on Iran, which the US has long believed is intent on developing nuclear weapons capability. But the spying revealed nothing of a nefarious nature.
“We've always assumed that this kind of thing goes on,” IAEA spokesperson Mark Gwozdecky told the Post in 2004. “We wish it were otherwise, but we know the reality.”
Then in 2003, the Bush administration wiretapped UN Security Council members to discover their intentions prior to votes on resolutions dealing with Iraq, according to a contemporaneous report in the British newspaper The Guardian.
Of course, one reason the US might be interested in spying on the UN is because other nations have used it as a place to assign spies with diplomatic cover.
The Russian spy ring rolled up by the US in 2010 was managed by sleeper agents based in the New York offices of the Russian mission to the UN, for instance. Posing as low-level diplomats, these agents passed cash to, and took information from, Russian agents living without benefit of official cover.
“The Russian mission to the United Nations has been at the center of Moscow's sprawling intelligence-gathering operations in the United States for decades, providing Soviet and Russian operatives with ideal circumstances to infiltrate US diplomatic missions, businesses, and circles of political elites,” wrote Colum Lynch in Foreign Policy magazine in 2003.

Mr. Lynch quotes former US permanent representative to the UN Daniel Patrick Moynihan on this subject. When named to their post in 1975, Moynihan was summoned to the office of then-Vice President Nelson Rockefeller.
“There was something urgent they had to tell me,” Moynihan wrote in the mid-1980s. “The first thing I must know about the United Nations, [Rockefeller] said, is that the Soviets would be listening to every telephone call I made from our mission from the ambassador's suite in the Waldorf Towers.”
Wednesday night on “The Colbert Report,” host Stephen Colbert discussed the U.K.'s horse meat scandal and how, for once, the tainted meat they're trying to put in you in Europe isn't attached to Silvio Berlusconi.
“You know, folks,” they began, “as an American, I like to talk about other countries that are not us, with their crazy names, ‘Not-America-stan.'”
One other country, the United Kingdom, is currently embroiled in a scandal that Colbert said is “rocking the world of meat.”
U.K. food inspectors have found horse meat in products that were labeled as beef, including some frozen lasagne meals and beef patties served at Burger King restaurants.
“Yes, someone in Europe is trying to slip you their tainted meat,” said Colbert, “and for once, it's not Silvio Berlusconi.”
After a beat, they said, “He has been known to yank their meat right off the shelf.”
Everyone in Europe is concerned they're biting down on horse, they continued, “instead of their usual pickled sheep's brain.”

Last spring, the House passed on a straight party-line vote Rep. Paul Ryan's mandatory Medicare privatization plan, which the Congressional Budget Office said would force future seniors to pick up two-thirds of their health care costs with no guarantee that those costs would come down.
On Thursday, Ryan, R-Wis., with a bipartisan boost from Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., offered a revamped version of their plan, dubbed premium support because the government gives beneficiaries cash or a voucher to help them pay for plans sold by private insurance companies. The changes from their earlier plan were stark.
Choosing a private plan would no longer be mandatory; traditional Medicare would still be an option. Overall costs for Medicare would be capped at the same level now mandated by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (dubbed Obamacare by its opponents), not at the far lower rate of inflation Ryan used in their previous plan. And their latest plan would forbid premium increases for low- and moderate-income seniors unless Congress intervened.
There's more. State based exchanges – should they survive Republican efforts to repeal reform – will not be asked to regulate and oversee insurers that sell these new Medicare plans. Nor would there be a national exchange to ensure the plans meet all the guarantees contained in the Ryan-Wyden proposal, which include no discrimination for pre-existing conditions; higher premium support levels for sicker seniors; and a minimum set of benefits comparable to current Medicare coverage. Instead, the plan, which wouldn't go into effect until 2022, requires the Medicare bureaucracy to administer all the new rules – the same bureaucracy that many Republicans until recently blamed for most of the system's woes.
When asked if they still supported repeal of health care reform, Ryan said, “Absolutely.” The irony wasn't lost on one of the original architects of the premium support idea in the 1990s. “There is something truly weird when guys like Ryan want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but then take a population twice as big and twice as hard to handle and put them in the same administrative framework,” said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and one of the nation's leading health care experts.
Ryan's retreat isn't hard to explain. The reason is politics. Democratic challengers running for Congress next year have been chomping at the bit to go after Republican House members who voted in favor of Ryan's original plan, which passed on a straight party-line vote. “It repositions Ryan in a major way since their previous position was attacked as destroying Medicare and this cannot be,” said Alice Rivlin, a one-time Democratic head of the CBO now at the Brookings Institution who co-authored a premium support plan with former Republican Senator Pete Domenici that is very similar to the Ryan-Wyden plan.
Incumbent Republican moderates, perhaps suffering from a severe case of buyers' remorse, can now point to bipartisan support for this updated version of the Ryan plan, which can more easily be sold to seniors than the earlier plan. However, Tea Party-backed conservatives may attack Ryan for selling out their principles and endorsing Obamacare-style Medicare privatization. When Bill Hoagland of the Bipartisan Policy Center at an early morning unveiling of the plan noted that both sponsors would face opposition within their respective caucuses, Wyden immediately chimed in, “Ya think?”
Neither Wyden nor Ryan held out any hope that the plan would receive serious discussion on the Hill during the coming election year. And it is not at all clear that plan would win broad bi-partisan support in a post-election setting. Even as it was being unveiled, differences quickly emerged on how it would control costs, which is the only reason to tinker with Medicare in the first place.
For instance, the plan calls for capping annual growth in government spending on the program at the rate of growth of the domestic economy (gross domestic product or GDP) plus one percent. Sound familiar? It should. It is the same formula that is now part of the health care reform law.
However, Ryan-Wyden doesn't depend on the much-vilified Independent Payment Advisory Board – dubbed “death panels” by Republicans in the run-up to their victorious 2010 election –to identify ways of saving money whenever the growth rate exceeds GDP + 1 percent. Instead, it would kick the can directly over to Congress to come up with the savings.
What might Congress do? “Cut provider reimbursements,” Wyden offered. “Let's look at the increases in prescription drug prices, in device prices. There are lots of other things.” Countered Ryan: “Maybe the premium hikes should be more on wealthier seniors.”
In other words, the latest plan to save Medicare for future generations depends on competition between insurance companies to control costs. And if it doesn't, future Congresses will step in to debate the best way to administer the pain.
Sound familiar?
Terminally ill welfare claimants are being asked by benefit assessors when precisely they are expected to die, according to evidence seen by Frank Field, the newly elected chairperson of the work and pensions select committee.
Field has written to the work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, asking for an explanation. They told the Guardian: “There is absolutely no need for this level of intrusive and painful questioning by DWP officials. If I have had two such cases in my constituency in recent weeks; I dread to think how often this is happening around the country.”
The Labour MP for Birkenhead said one of the complaints had come to them from a vicar on behalf of their sister.
The two individuals were claiming for a personal independence payment (PIP) under the “special rules terminally ill” procedure. Both had submitted DS 1500 forms signed by their doctor – forms that need to be signed if the patient is regarded as suffering from a terminal illness.
The DS 1500 asks for factual information and does not require the doctor to give a prognosis. It should contain details of the diagnosis, including whether the patient is aware of their condition and, if unaware, the name and address of the patient's representative.
It should also set out the current and proposed treatment, and brief details of clinical findings. A doctor is expected to believe that the patient is likely to die within six months, but once the form is submitted the Department for Work and Pensions decision-makers are not expected to challenge a patient about the expected date of of death, or question a patient who is not aware the doctor has declared their illness to be terminal.
The claimant, once found by the doctor to be terminally ill, is not supposed to meet any qualifying period for a claim, and should get the highest rate of claim.
In a letter sent to Duncan Smith on 30 June, Field writes: “My constituents tell me that despite submitting a DS 1500 form drawing attention to a terminal illness, they have been asked directly to their face whether they think they will soon die and by what date they expect to be dead. In one case my constituent's mother was asked by when they expected their daughter to die and in front of their daughter.”
They continued: “This has left my constituents feeling understandably very upset. They tell me they are appalled by the hardness of the questioning and its intrusiveness.”
Field said they had asked to see the guidance, either national or local, that could have led PIP assessors to think this line of questioning was legitimate. They had also asked for Duncan Smith to review the policy at a national level.
PIP is replacing the disability living allowance, and has been dogged by delays. The standard daily living component of PIP is worth £54 a week.
The DWP said: “Claims from people with a terminal illness are fast-tracked using ‘special rules', where we pay the highest rate of care immediately without a face-to-face assessment.
“All claims are dealt with fairly, sensitively and compassionately by specially trained staff – they do not ask specifics around life expectancy.”
The DWP said the latest statistics showed that more than 99% of people with terminal illnesses who had applied for the benefit, had been awarded it, which meant more than 35,000 people were receiving PIP.
Story highlights Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab claims responsibility for the attack
The explosion happened across the street from a hotel that was attacked two months ago
Mogadishu has been the site of frequent attacks by Al-Shabaab
Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) A car bomb exploded at a restaurant near the presidential palace in the heart of Somalia's capital Tuesday, killing at least 10 people, including a woman and a boy, police said.
Somalia-based Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack. Group spokesperson Sheikh Abdiaziz Musab, speaking to pro-Al-Shabaab outlet Andalus radio, said the blast targeted and killed several Somali intelligence agents.
Somali police spokesperson Qasim Mohamed Roble told reporters that the car bomb killed no government official or soldier. Among the dead, they said, was a boy who shined shoes.
The area is not a new target for Al-Shabaab, which has battled Somalia's government for years with the goal of establishing a fundamentalist Islamic state.
The restaurant is across the street from the Central Hotel, where Al-Shabaab killed at least 15 people in a bombing and gun attack in February

Derek Roy isn't big in stature, but the Vancouver Canucks are counting on them to fill a gaping hole at center.
Struggling to score with two proven NHL centers in the lineup, the Canucks acquired 5-foot-8 Roy from the Dallas Stars on Tuesday in exchange for a second-round pick in the 2013 NHL Draft and defense prospect Kevin Connauton.
Roy, who said they are finally healthy after an early-season groin injury, is ready to fill that gap on a Canucks team that has scored more than two goals four times in the past 16 games -- and one of those included two empty-net goals -- even if they aren't yet sure where or how much they will play.
Derek Roy Center - VAN GOALS: 4 | ASST: 18 | PTS: 22
SOG: 65 | +/-: 3
Roy spent their first eight seasons with the Buffalo Sabres before being traded to Dallas last summer, and they admitted they don't know much about the Canucks or Vancouver. Roy hadn't talked to coaches about how they fit in, but after being unable to agree to a contract extension with the Stars they sounded eager to join a playoff-bound team.
"I felt bad because everybody wanted to do well here in Dallas and to win a Stanley Cup here, but at the same time I am now excited to go to an organization like Vancouver and excited to step in and play some big minutes and expect to go far in the playoffs," Roy said. "I had some minor injuries that set me back, but I am skating really well now and excited to help the team make a playoff push."
Roy, 29, had four goals and 18 assists in 30 games for the Stars. They put up six points in their final five games -- and they will be welcomed on a team that has played most of the season with Henrik Sedin and fourth-liner Maxim Lapierre as its healthy centers.
"I liked a lot of things," general manager Mike Gillis said of Roy. "I like the points-per-game average, I like the playmaking aspect and the opportunity to add another layer of offense I thought was important."
With Selke Trophy winner Ryan Kesler, who has played seven games this season, scheduled to be back on the ice within a week, the Canucks could suddenly go from a dearth to enviable depth down the middle.
That likely leaves Roy on a third line between Jannik Hansen and Chris Higgins, who signed a four-year, $10 million contract extension Tuesday, though Gillis mentioned another intriguing possibility.
"I really think we have a great third line if he's playing between Jannik Hansen and Chris Higgins," Gillis said, noting that line combinations are ultimately coach Alain Vigneault's decision. "There is an opportunity for them to play as a second-line center with Ryan on the wing, so we have lots of flexibility -- more flexibility than we had yesterday."
The increased flexibility includes trying to deal goaltender Roberto Luongo, who has been waiting for a trade since losing the No. 1 job to Cory Schneider three games into last year's Stanley Cup Playoffs. With the addition of Roy, Vancouver no longer needs a center in return for Luongo, who is in the third season of a 12-year, $64 million contract.
"Instead of being really focused on that one piece of the puzzle we can now look at other areas we would like to strengthen. We can look at other possibilities, maybe three-way deals," Gillis said. "We're still looking to be active."
Vancouver was one of the last teams in the bidding for big San Jose Sharks wing Ryane Clowe, who was traded to the New York Rangers for three draft picks Tuesday night. Gillis confirmed they were given permission to speak to Clowe's agent, but felt location -- not Clowe's desire for a contract extension -- was the main impediment.
"I think the opportunity to go to the East Coast was the most important thing from what we were told," Gillis said. "He liked our team, they liked our situation, but it sounds like geography was the dictating feature."
Regardless whether they add more players before Wednesday's trade deadline, the Canucks are hoping the speedy Roy brings an emotional lift to a depleted locker room that's missing Kesler and Manny Malhotra. The latter is done for the season and their career could be over because of safety concerns about their limited vision. That left them using rookie Jordan Schroeder, who was sent down to the American Hockey League on Tuesday, and a variety of wings at center.
Now they can lean on Roy, who averaged almost 29 goals and more than 73 points at their peak as a top-line center from 2007-08 through 2009-10. Their numbers slipped as they battled injuries and moved down the depth chart, with 17 goals and 44 points in 80 games for the Buffalo Sabres last season before being traded to Dallas.
Dealt for a second time in less than a year, and headed to unrestricted free agency this summer after a four-year, $24 million contract expires, Roy needs to show they are worthy of a new deal Dallas evidently wasn't willing to offer.
"It's obviously tough, especially the trade from Buffalo -- I was there a long time and they felt they needed a change," Roy said. "Everything happens for a reason and I am real excited to have a healthy rest of the season and healthy playoffs and showing people what I can do."
For the Canucks, just being a healthy center is a great start.

It's been a little over a month since the blow-up surrounding Felix ‘Pewdiepie' Kjellberg, and the Wall Street Journal report leading to the cancellation of their premium show. Since then, a lot has happened to the YouTuber and to at least one of the reporters who worked on that story.

For Pewdiepie, it's been a month of roiling emotions, including anger, intentionally taboo jokes and an intensified critique of the press, some of which they now tell Kotaku that they could have handled differently. For one of the reporters involved in the piece, it's been a month of Twitter backlash from furious Pewdiepie fans, but that reaction has been met mostly with silence by them and the outlet that employs him.
To quickly recap: the original WSJ article reported that Disney was severing ties with the YouTube star after the paper presented it with several examples of Pewdiepie making jokes about Jews or Nazis, including a video in which they paid freelancers to hold up a sign that read “Death To All Jews.” While Pewdiepie said some of the references had been taken out of context, they also To quickly recap: the original WSJ article reported that Disney was severing ties with the YouTube star after the paper presented it with several examples of Pewdiepie making jokes about Jews or Nazis, including a video in which they paid freelancers to hold up a sign that read “Death To All Jews.” While Pewdiepie said some of the references had been taken out of context, they also apologized for jokes they that they admitted went too far. A day later, YouTube cancelled the second season of the Scare Pewdiepie premium show.

The Journal article had three bylines, but since it ran, the person who has suffered the brunt of harassment on social media has been business entertainment reporter Ben Fritz. Fritz had the third byline, usually an indicator of having been least involved with a piece. For weeks now, Fritz's Twitter mentions have been South Park avatar on Twitter, were enough to brand Fritz a hypocrite in the eyes of Pewdiepie's fans—the thinking being, how could someone who seemingly appreciates crass humor “go after” a comedian like Pewdiepie? TheJournalarticle had three bylines, but since it ran, the person who has suffered the brunt of harassment on social media has been business entertainment reporter Ben Fritz. Fritz had the third byline, usually an indicator of having been least involved with a piece. For weeks now, Fritz's Twitter mentions have been a mess of people demanding that they get fired blaming them for damage done to Pewdiepie. Rolfe Winkler and Jack Nicas, the first two bylines, have gotten slight pushback on social media, but not nearly as much. On YouTube, Fritz has become the face of the newspaper thanks to a video where those freelancers from Kjellberg's earlier video decided to hold up a new sign that read ‘Hypofritz.' The portmanteau, which has now become a hashtag, spun out of old Fritz Tweets dug up by Kjellberg supporters. In the 2009 Tweet, Fritz is talking about a Chanukah party and remarks that they “had no idea Jews were so adept at frying.” That, combined with Fritz'sSouth Parkavatar on Twitter, were enough to brand Fritz a hypocrite in the eyes of Pewdiepie's fans—the thinking being, how could someone who seemingly appreciates crass humor “go after” a comedian like Pewdiepie?
Fritz has not reacted to this publicly, but regardless, those who have been swarming their every Tweet with questions about why they still have a job have put the bulk of the responsibility on a single journalist, who people assume must feel a certain way about Kjellberg's brand of humor. We reached out to Fritz and the Wall Street Journal , but they did not comment. In a follow-up piece on February 16th, well before the harassment kicked into high gear, a WSJ spokesperson said that the paper “stand[s] by the reporting.”
As the weeks went by, Kjellberg continued to pour gas on the fire. Rather than refraining from making Nazi references, they made some more, though with new context of skewering their critics. In game footage from last month, Kjellberg pretended to kill Hitler in jest, so that they could get a ‘free pass' on their humor. The YouTube description for this video, which is currently the top featured footage on their channel, says the whole thing is “sponsored by WSJ.” In another video, they called a character a “secret Barbie Nazi” for lifting their arm, which Kjellberg has repeatedly suggested is a goof that alerts the Wall Street Journal to nefarious content. Wall Street Journal. More recently, they pretended that a cardboard cutout of Danny Devito called Kjellberg a Nazi, in reference to the wider controversy. Some call-outs offer a visual gag where Ben Fritz, or the word ‘Hypofritz' are pictured. These references have become sparser recently, but they still pop-up as in-jokes from time to time.

Kjellberg's audience has not abandoned him.
Kjellberg's decision to keep banging that drum is a bit surprising when you consider that they apologized for the stunt that set everything off, claiming that they were taking it as a “ Conan Exiles video, they grimace after saying “Hitler did nothing wrong,” noting that their tired shtick is “not a video, it really isn't.”
Kjellberg's decision to keep banging that drum is a bit surprising when you consider that they apologized for the stunt that set everything off, claiming that they were taking it as a “ a learning and growing experience. ” Moreover, in a different follow-up on March 3rd, Kjellberg said “Obviously I'm not going to see [the controversy] some way to provoke or start drama, I have really no intentions of doing that...it's not something I thrive on.” Despite acknowledging that their jokes went “too far,” and claiming that they didn't want to start drama, Kjellberg did not make a clean break from what was happening. Many of these jokes are forced, and Kjellberg knows it: at one point during theConan Exilesvideo, they grimace after saying “Hitler did nothing wrong,” noting that their tired shtick is “not a video, it really isn't.”

More than a month since this all started, Kjellberg says that making these jokes were their way of dealing with a difficult time.
“I think when events like this have occurred you can either stay sad, angry or laughing afterwards,” they told Kotaku in an email. “I think laughing is the best way and making jokes is by no means a way to further provoke. I'm moving forward from everything that happened but that doesn't mean I'm going to pretend it never did.”

Kjellberg's audience has not abandoned him. The footage where they pretend to kill Hitler, or references the Hypofritz sign, are some of their most watched videos in the last few weeks, raking in millions of views. The optics of the situation work in their favor when you consider that the video from the Journal accompanying the original article took at least one clip out of context. At one point, the WSJ presented a Nazi reference that Kjellberg made without noting that they were actually asking their fanbase to stop making Swastikas in their mobile game. Not all clips pinpointed by the media were miscategorized, of course, but the fact any were at all makes it easier for people to buy into the idea that the media is out to destroy Kjellberg, rather than doing the basic duty of reporting on influential figures that people care about. To their audience, Kjellberg can appear as a wronged party here—even the Fiverr freelancers are on their side:

On the other end of the spectrum, you've got actual quarrels and beefs unfolding between YouTubers, where emotions run high and feelings get hurt. Often, these spats are followed obsessively by “drama” channels, YouTube's version of TMZ. Due to their volatile nature, the “benefit” of these fights is a toss-up for the actual people involved, even if millions of viewers eat it up like popcorn.

But through the Wall Street Journal , and to a lesser degree Ben Fritz, Kjellberg has inadvertently found the perfect rivalry target.

When I asked Kjellberg about their quarrel with the media, they disagreed that it was anything like their playful video beefs. This one, they said, came out of real feelings. “What happened to me and the media is obviously different than me vs Jacksepticeye, etc,” they wrote. “I went strongly out as ‘me vs the media' in my initial response video. Which looking back on now was a bit childish. I do think I've been misrepresented a lot over the years and many of my frustrations came out.”

In the past, Kjellberg has alleged that the media,Kotakuincluded, only pays attention to their gaffes rather than their good deeds, such as charity work. ( Not true. ) With the recent blitz of negative coverage, Kjellberg feels that many outlets are painting them as a Nazi sympathizer/enabler, a characterization that, in their mind, doesn't ring true. As far as Kjellberg is concerned, the media is so eager to paint them as the bad guy, they can get basic facts about them wrong. When that happens, Kjellberg plays it off for laughs on Twitter and on YouTube for an audience that is ready to denounce traditional media as a whole.
“Yes, it's frustrating to be misrepresented especially concerning serious issues, but it can also be fun to just joke about,” Kjellberg said. “If there's a ‘pewdiepie vs the media' now, the way I see it is just for laughs.”

As for the members of the media that were part of this crossfire, when asked about the barrage of Tweets against the Journal reporters, including Fritz, Kjellberg said: “Fans getting involved directly on my behalf is something I'm always against,” they said. “It's byproduct of having an audience this scale. But taken from past experiences, I know they'll move away soon as well.”
For a good while, Kjellberg had one of Fritz's Tweets featured on their on Twitter.com page, but they recently took it down. Hopefully, it's a sign that he, and maybe their fans, are ready to move on.
Long before there was a debate on the effect of guns on public safety, there was a seven-term member of congress named Robert Cousins, an erudite Iowan who bewailed the health hazard of a new technology around the turn of the 20th century called the automobile.
"Horrible and gruesome incidents are of almost daily occurrence," they said, noting how the driver recklessness has "bespattered boulevards with blood" and is "crippling and killing people at a rate that is appalling."
That was not hyperbole. The New York Times columnist, Nicholas Kristof, once calculated that if we still had the same auto fatality rate that we had around 1921, there would be 715,000 Americans killed in vehicular accidents every year.
Nobody ever suggested we ban cars. We responded rationally, and in spite of our intense love of automobiles, we applied rules and technologies we now take for granted - safety inspections, traffic regulations, seatbelts, airbags, license restrictions for teens, DWI laws, banning distractions such as texting, and more.
All this happened because lawmakers recognized automotive deaths as a public health crisis.
Result: Using that 1921 math, we have reduced the auto fatality rate by 95 percent.
Pause here to salute American ingenuity.
In the aftermath of yet another mass slaughter by a man with an assault rifle in Texas, we wonder why Congress cannot muster the ingenuity to apply similar safety measures toward guns - which we don't love nearly as much as our cars.
The short answer, of course, is that lawmakers are either emasculated by a powerful gun lobby or seem to believe that thoughts and prayers can stop bullets.
But we can dial back the carnage, if we begin by acknowledging a problem (having our three worst mass shootings in the last 17 months is a problem) followed by small but significant measures that would threaten no law-abiding citizen's right to own a firearm.
Terror or not, let's get the assault weapons | Editorial
There have been 21 mass killings (at least four dead in one incident) and 305 mass shootings (four or more struck by a bullet) this year. And we know that these cases have a common denominator: In more than half of the 156 mass shootings between 2009 and 2016, it was related to domestic violence, according to Everytown for Gun Safety.
It also found that more than one-third of the cases - 34 percent - involved a shooter who was prohibited from possessing firearms.
This is not complicated: Men guilty of domestic violence need to be separated from firearms. The man who killed 26 people in a Texas church last week was such a case. They had a history of mental illness should have been prevented from having their assault rifle, but the Air Force failed to enter their name into the federal database used for instant background checks.
Or consider the impact of closing the so-called gun show loophole: In the 14 states that have checks for unlicensed sales, women are 46 percent less likely to be shot to death by a partner; cops are 48 percent less likely to be killed with a handgun. Even 93 percent of gun owners support background checks, while 88 percent favor a ban on gun sales to people with violent histories.
The rest - magazine limits, ending immunity for manufacturers, bump stock bans, etc. -can come later, after the firearm fetishists who run the NRA realize that little has changed, other than the body count.
We cannot control the mental health or violent impulses of people. We cannot control how they feel about race, religion, or even mothers-in-law. But the Sutherland Springs massacre reminds us that we can make it harder for people with violent pasts to obtain firearms, much less an assault rifle.
We don't need another debate on the right to own guns; that's settled. What's needed is a dispassionate dialogue about specific policies that can protect public health and save lives. Those policies are readily apparent, just as they were with automobiles. We just need the political courage to enact them.

Much has been written and said about the impressive play of Ottawa Fury FC's back line this season.
The endurance of those four players, however, hasn't been highlighted enough.
If familiarity breeds success, the play of the four defenders and goalkeeper Romuald Peiser should come as no surprise when you take a quick look at the stat sheet. Through 29 NASL league games this season, Peiser, right back Ryan Richter and centre back Colin Falvey have played each of the 2,610 minutes Fury has been on the pitch. Fellow centre back Rafael Alves, with 2,544 minutes, and left back Mason Trafford, with 2,160, aren't far behind with the fivesome remaining unchanged since the spring season.
Despite the workload, none of them seem the least bit tired, which is a good thing because Fury's season finale in Atlanta could very well be the match that decides who claims top spot in the league's combined standings. Fury could have locked that up Sunday had the San Antonio Scorpions beaten or tied the New York Cosmos, but the spring season champions managed to pick up all three points to move within two of Fury on the combined table.
Though Marc Dos Santos may have given some of their big-minute players a game off had the Atlanta game not had any importance, they may have had a fight on their hands. While Richter said completing the regular season streak isn't a big deal, they have no interest in sitting one out.
"It's nice and I'm lucky I haven't had any injuries this year," they said of their run of consecutive games. "I don't want to miss a game, no matter what it means. I'm pretty sure that everyone would say that."
On Friday, a day after returning from winning the fall season in Jacksonville, Falvey was asked if they needed some rest.
"Today? Yes," they said, laughing. "But no, when next week comes around, I'll be good."
They said finishing the season without missing any time would be a "nice accomplishment" but said it was up to-Dos Santos.
"If the (Atlanta) game ends up not meaning anything to us, I'll speak to Marc and make a decision."
If any of the players have any say, there likely won't be any changes at the back for Fury to close out the regular season schedule.
As for who Fury will be squaring off against in the NASL Championship semi-finals, that remains to be seen, though it's looking increasingly likely it will be the Tampa Bay Rowdies, who have a one-point lead over the Fort Lauderdale Strikers for the last of four spots.
"For us it doesn't matter (who Fury plays)," said Falvey, whose side was presented with the fall season championship trophy prior to Sunday's Ottawa 67's game. "The good thing is both teams probably won't relish coming up to the cold, so maybe there's a slight advantage there. But it's a semi-final, anything can happen."
The Irish defender has been on championship teams before but said what the club has accomplished so far – and could still accomplish – is pretty special.
"Everyone's aware of some of the other teams' budgets, so a new a club like us just finding our feet in the league (to make it this far), it's a huge accomplishment and right up there with anything I've done in my career."
But just how much does this team want to win the Soccer Bowl?
"A lot, I would say, to use descriptive language," forward Andrew Wiedeman said. "You take it one at a time, though, and we still have work to do."
League winners to be decided Saturday
As Fury FC closes out its regular season in Atlanta against the Silverbacks on Saturday, they'll be as hungry ever for the full three points.
Thanks to New York's win Sunday, the Cosmos are two points back of Fury for the combined title. Fury can claim the overall win with a victory in Atlanta and while a draw would also likely do the job based on Fury's better goal differential, Ottawa wants to take the mystery out of it early.
Not to mention that if Fury loses its 4 p.m., they'll have to spend an agonizing couple hours watching the Cosmos play the Rowdies at 7 p.m.
"It's huge to get the combined title, which shows your the best team over the course of 30 games," forward Andrew Wiedeman said.
Fury will then host an as-yet-undetermined opponent in the Championship semi-finals at TD Place on Nov. 8.

Money isn't everything, even in Hollywood and Olivia Munn is now revealing how taking a dramatic pay cut led to some of the biggest breaks of their career.
The actor explained in a new interview that when they jumped from G4's “Attack of the Show” to “The Daily Show,” the salary wasn't what drew them to the new gig.
“I took an 80 percent pay cut because nothing's better than Jon Stewart thinking you're funny,” said Munn in the November issue of the Self magazine.

The risk paid off, as Munn was featured in 16 episodes as a correspondent for the long-running Comedy Central program and soon made a successful crossover into film, with roles in “Magic Mike” and “Iron Man 2.”
The former co-host broke geeky gamers' hearts when they left G4 in 2010 after spending four years covering conventions and video games, and said at the time that they wished they could do it all. “Apparently you can't do four shows at once,” they lamented.
In 2011, they took another gamble with a new job — a starring role in Aaron Sorkin‘s “The Newsroom.”

Despite having offers to star in three sitcoms and two dramas, Munn was hell-bent on auditioning for the HBO show.
“I knew that if I held out for Sorkin my life could change,” they explained.
Munn has played on-air economics correspondent Sloan Sabbith for two seasons so far and will return to the role when “The Newsroom” begins its third and final season on Nov. 9 on HBO.

Over the last few weeks, Walmart has been running a marketing contest on its Facebook page. The store that got the most "likes" wins a personal appearance from Pitbull, aka Miami rapper Armando Christian Perez.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — It's not exactly "International Love," but Miami rap star Pitbull is about to bring their act to a nonetheless far-flung site — Kodiak, Alaska.
The unlikely tour stop announced Tuesday will mark the first time the chart-topper will visit the state known as The Last Frontier, and it comes as a result of a marketing deal and perhaps a little mischief.
Pitbull, aka Armando Christian Perez, in a promotion with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Sheets Energy Strips, agreed to visit whichever Walmart got the most "likes" on its Facebook page.
David Thorpe, a writer for The Boston Phoenix, thought it would be funny to exile the "Give Me Everything" rapper to the most remote Walmart possible, and encouraged people to "like" the Walmart in Kodiak.
The store in a city with a population of about 6,100 wound up with more than 70,000 "likes." The surrounding borough, which Alaska has rather than counties, has about 14,000 people.
Wal-Mart spokesperson Sarah Spencer said details of the trip are still being worked out, including whether it will be a one- or two-day appearance.
Pitbull will spend time in the community and with Walmart employees, Spencer said.
Pitbull appeared in a YouTube video Tuesday while on tour in Madrid, Spain.
"I heard that Kodiak, Alaska, has the most likes due to someone who thinks they were playing a prank," Pitbull said on the video. "I said, 'OK, great, this sounds really good.' You have to understand I will go anywhere in the world for my fans."
And they don't want to make the trip alone.
"I want to invite that someone who thinks it's a joke to Kodiak, Alaska, with me," they said.
It appears that invitation will be accepted.
In an email to The Associated Press, Thorpe said it's "very likely" he'll be in Kodiak. Thorpe said they had to "raise the funds to get to Kodiak on my own, since Pitbull's invitation doesn't include actually getting me there."
Thorpe said they don't really have anything against Pitbull, and instead saw this as a way "to disrupt a corporate social media campaign, since they really set themselves up for it."
They said they did make a little fun of Pitbull in their column "for having to act enthusiastic about being sent to a random Walmart, so I wanted to make sure they went somewhere interesting."
Thorpe said they have no idea what to expect when both men are in Kodiak.
"I guess my one regret is that everyone on the corporate side will probably spin this as a Big Social Media Win, which is kind of gross."
Getty Enhanced Interrogation ‘Wait for the Government to Collapse and Then You're in Power Again' Liberal writer Jonathan Chait sees a model for Democrats in the Trump era. Their name is Mitch McConnell.
Katelyn Fossett is associate editor at POLITICO Magazine.
Among the slice of Washington that might be writing a book at any given time—a pretty big slice compared to other cities—November 8, 2016 was one of those big upsets that epitomizes the age-old publishing fear of being overtaken by events. Audacity: How Obama Defied Their Critics and Transformed America, by New York Magazine writer and liberal pundit Jonathan Chait, is among those that undoubtedly was written with the expectation of a Hillary Clinton presidency, prompting them to scramble on deadline to adapt to the new world of Donald Trump.
POLITICO Magazine spoke with them to ask if they stood by their argument: Would reforms on climate and health care really be so durable in the era of a president who's promised to blow up so much of the status quo, and particularly the parts of it that belong to Barack Obama? Chait is still optimistic—the book, they say, required only a little reframing. Real policy momentum, when set in motion on such a big scale, is hard to stop, they say. Chait also has one overarching a bit of advice for Democrats under Trump: Mimic congressional Republicans under Mitch McConnell and keep cooperation to a bare minimum. “Disassociate yourself from the outcomes, wait for the government to collapse and then you're in power again,” they say. Simple.
Story Continued Below
This conversation has been edited for clarity.
Politico Magazine: Your book is about how Obama's progressive legacy will endure. You had to have had a little bit of a pause about that conclusion after Trump was elected.
Jonathan Chait: The premise of the book is that the depth and the breadth of Obama's legacy has been underestimated not only by their opponents but also by most of their supporters. So after the election, everybody on both sides immediately jumped to the conclusion that Trump is going to erase Obama's legacy. I think that conclusion stems from the same mistake that I'm trying to address in the first place, which is a failure to appreciate just how broad and how deep the changes Obama managed to enact were. So I needed to reframe the argument toward that end but I didn't need to change the basic argument. If you think Obama did very little and that what they did was through executive actions, then your conclusion is “Ha ha, your book has been nullified.” But that's the thing I don't agree with in the first place. So that didn't require a fundamental rethinking of the thesis but mostly reframing the thesis with that in mind.
Politico: But some parts are obviously more secure than others. What is the most vulnerable part of that legacy?
Chait: Clearly higher taxes on the rich. That's not the biggest part of Obama's legacy but it's an important one. They allowed an expiration of the Bush tax cuts on incomes over 400,000 dollars year and they also raised taxes on the rich through the ACA, and the Republicans have clear voting majorities and power to reverse those and perhaps even go further. [Bill] Clinton swung the pendulum toward higher taxes on the rich, [George W.] Bush swung it back, Obama swung it back even harder and Trump is likely to swing it back in the other direction. That seems almost impossible to stop when Trump is president.
Next most vulnerable is climate. I don't think he'll go as far as people think, because the argument I think is that technological, economic and diplomatic momentum is strong enough that it won't be reversed. But their plan was to accelerate that momentum, and that acceleration is not going to happen, and that acceleration needs to happen in order to get the most optimal results in terms of mitigating climate change.
Politico: What do you think is the biggest problem facing Democrats right now?
Chait: The biggest problem facing Democrats are that the electoral system gives disproportionate power to Republicans, through a series of quirks in the representation system at every level: The House, state legislatures, the Senate, the Electoral College all give Republicans disproportionate voting power. To really address the problem will require in the long run democratic reforms of the system. But the thing is, in order to change the system, you have to have control in the system. So they'll need to win a lot of elections first in order to have the chance to implement democratic reforms.
Politico: So the first step of that is to win enough elections to control that process to some extent. For that first step, what is the biggest piece of political strategy advice you have?
Chait: I think you have to muster effective and clear opposition to the Republican government that we have before us, which I think is highly likely to produce both methods and outcomes that are unpopular. Mitch McConnell's strategy of withholding bipartisan support and forcing the majority party to have complete responsibility for all outcomes is an effective one for an opposition. That's the best model. That's the one that's most in line with political science evidence about how people vote, and that's the one that should be followed. I think that if you simply start from the point that the last Republican government, of George W. Bush, was a comprehensive failure and that the problems that produced that failure has all gotten worse in the Republican Party since then … then the most likely outcome of this Republican government is probably another failure, or probably an even worse failure, which is a horrible thing for the country but actually a very convenient one for the Democratic Party. So you follow that strategy, disassociate yourself from the outcomes, wait for the government to collapse and then you're in power again.
Politico: Would that take four years or eight years?
Chait: I don't know. It all depends on events. It's more of a when, rather than an if question—of when they fail. I would attribute the failure of the Republican government under Bush to the extremism and resistance to data to the tendency toward corruption that the Republican governing coalition had—which is due to its reliance on business lobbyists and lack of countervailing forces within their coalition, like Democrats have between labor and unions, offsetting businesses' power. And the lack of curiosity of the president, which again, is much worse now that it was under George W. Bush. And so I think if you look at all those factors, it's gotten worse, and while we can't predict with future with any certainty, things are likely to get worse. So, this is bad for the country and the way things go badly might result in horrific tragedies, so that's a grim prospect, but if you're simply analyzing the political calculation, that's available to the opposition.
Politico: So you do think Democrats should follow that?
Chait: Absolutely. There are times they're going to have to balance their political interests against policy outcomes. So if you have a chance to bargain with the majority party, in a way that averts humanitarian catastrophe, you could trade away some of your political leverage to do so. So if Republicans want to negotiate minor details on Obamacare so that they could call it a deal—if you can avoid subjecting millions of people to hardship, then that's probably worth doing. Climate would be another area where that kind of bargain is worth doing—giving them bipartisan cover in order to mitigate the damage of the policy agenda. But otherwise, if you're just analyzing what's in the political best interest, it's almost never to cooperate. I think McConnell was totally explicit about that calculus and it has I think borne out.
Politico: You're a former senior editor at the New Republic, which is an old, reliably liberal institution. This week they published a review of your book that criticized some elements of centrism, or what they called ‘grown-up liberalism' in your writing. What's going on here? Is this part of a bigger shift?
Chait: The left and liberalism belong to different traditions. They tended to congregate under the banner of the same party, because the two-party system lumps them together. But the New Republic used to be more of a liberal magazine; it's now more of a left magazine, like the Nation. You have a faction of the left that was always going to be ideologically hostile toward liberal politicians.
Politico: You're pretty optimistic about Obamacare surviving, at least in some way. How do you think this fight ends?
Chait: There are a lot of different outcomes, but most of them lead to the same results. But the basic dynamic we're seeing is that Republicans are realizing that their goal of repealing Obamacare sets them up for enormous political pain because there is no way they can craft a politically acceptable outcome given the ideological parameters that define their party. If you want to give people a terrific plan that keeps their coverage, let alone a private plan satisfies their stated objections to Obamacare, which are high deductibles and high premiums, then you actually need to spend more money than Obamacare to solve those problems. Even to get something as good as Obamacare you're lucky to spend as much money. But they can't possibly do that because they're a tax-phobic party, and [they're] also against insurance regulations that help redistribute money to people with pre-existing conditions, so they have no way to craft a plan that people will like. So if they don't take responsibility for the health care system, they're going to put in place something that people like much, much less than the status quo. So that is their problem politically.
Somehow Democrats have to find a way to leverage that Republican problem into a better policy outcome. Maybe they can leverage it by negotiating with Republicans to get Republicans to make a trade where potentially Democrats give them cover for their plan in return for policies that are pretty decent. Or maybe the Democrats leverage that by sitting back and watching while the Republicans set it on fire, causing a massive catastrophe, winning elections and then passing it alone. One way or another the Democrats have the opportunity to leverage that Republican problem into better policies, or at least decent policies.
Politico: So you think the fundamentals of it survive, or it looks very different?
Chait: I think the fundamentals probably survive, but how you get there is the question. It might be that Republicans realize they have a catastrophe, their replacement plan is unpopular, so they negotiate preemptively with Democrats to avoid a disruption, tinker with the system, call it repeal-and-replace, and then you end up with something a lot like Obamacare.
On the other hand, it could be that Republicans delay, then repeal the delay, never come up with their own plan, and then the delay gets delayed and delayed and delayed and delayed, and then it becomes a matter of extending it and then you just keep extending it and then you end up with the status quo.
Or it could be that Republicans try to repeal it and replace it; they'll fail and then Democrats have to try to use that disaster to win an election and re-fund a plan that Republicans defunded and then maybe tinker with it once they've regained majorities. So to me, the plausible paths all lead ultimately to the same outcome; it just depends on the politics and how much humanitarian pain is imposed in the meantime.
Politico: What should Obama do next?
Chait: I think that Obama is probably trying to work through whatever channel he's got with Trump; clearly they talk. Clearly Trump knows extremely little about politics and less about policy and can be influenced by whoever talks to them and flatters him. That's unlikely to work because the last person to talk to Trump always seems to win and the people who work with Trump make sure that's not going to be Obama very often. That's unlikely to work with Trump, but I think Obama might see what they can do that way and persuade Trump not to pursue disastrous policies.
But that's probably not going to work. Then the next step is becoming an open leader of the opposition, not providing quotes every day to the New York Times on behalf of the Democratic Party, but being a behind-the-scenes force and giving some high-profile speeches articulating the opposition. He's in the unusual position of being a youthful, popular, non-disgraced, non-scandalized president who has a successor who's actively working against their agenda. We don't have any models for that, and that's a powerful position for them to be in. He's much, much more popular than Donald Trump, and that gap is likely to grow. So he's got a pretty decent platform to give some high-profile speeches and I would hope and expect that they will use it.

The 33-year-old, who is in discussions over extending their three-year spell in W12, has been encouraged with recent displays from the likes of Matt Ingram, Cole Kpekawa and Michael Petrasso.
They told the Times: “I've been really impressed with the young lads who have come in.
“It's very difficult as a young defender to come into a team, especially in the Championship, so to slot in the way Cole has done has been great.
“I thought Mikey Petrasso did really well in what was a difficult game for us all at Burnley too, and was perhaps unfortunate not to play again [against Bristol City].
“Matty has been brilliant in goal as well. I'm sure the manager has been closely monitoring their progress and wondering whether they could handle playing first-team games at this level yet - and he's come through with flying colours.
“There are other young players as well here who look promising, that's what the fans want to see [youngsters coming through the system].
“It's something that clubs want as well. They invest a lot of time and money in the hope of seeing some of those younger players breaking through.
“There are lots of good players that you see at the ages of 16 to 18 that appear nailed on to make it, but for one reason or another don't get that opportunity. Timing is crucial and you need a bit of luck.
“Hopefully the lads here can come through, get some regular football at this level and go on to have good, long careers.”
Profiles of the Founder, BAB Japan 2009
開祖の横顔 – 14 interviews with direct students of O-Sensei
開祖の横顔 (Profiles of the Founder) was published in Japanese in 2009 by the publisher of Gekkan Hiden (“Secret Teachings Monthly”), a well known martial arts magazine in Japan.
It contains 14 interviews with direct students of Aikido Founder Morihei Ueshiba. None of these, to my knowledge, have been translated into English, but some of them are quite interesting.
I'm not going to translate any large portion of the interviews, but I'll pick out a few interesting sections here (note: I haven't included the Japanese because, unlike Morihei Ueshiba's own explanations, the speech of their students in these interviews was very straightforward).
Here's something from Masando Sasaki:
Q: Are there any episodes that you saw directly that left a deep impression on you?
A: You must be talking about Hiroshi Arakawa, the pro-baseball player. When Arakawa came to the dojo and I introduced him, “Sensei, this is Arakawa-sensei, who is famous in baseball”, O-Sensei asked, “Is that the one that you light on fire?”. So I said, “Sensei, that's O-Kyu” (Note: “moxibustion, as opposed to “yakyu“, which is “baseball”). Since O-Sensei did not know what baseball was, I explained, “You hold a stick (bat) and hit the balls that are thrown to you”. O-Sensei replied, “For something like that why don't you just cut through with a Japanese sword?” – O-Sensei didn't quite get the point (laughing).
(…)
Finally, Arakawa eyed the bokken held by O-Sensei and swung at it from the side. At that moment O-Sensei filled themselves with Ki and Arakawa and the bat were sent flying.
Arakawa was certainly sent flying at least twice, and then they applied to become a student.
If you've seen the First Aikido Friendship Demonstration held in Tokyo in 1985 – Yasuo Kobayashi relates much the same story, in slightly more detail.
Sasaki goes on to relate how they (the students) tried various things in an attempt to discover what O-Sensei had been doing – but could never successfully replicate the feat performed by the Founder.
It's a good example of “mysterious things we saw the Founder do but none of us ever figured out” – and a good example of what I was discussing in “Aikido and the Unknown“, which brought up the problem of a break in the transmission from Morihei Ueshiba to their students.
That article also included some quotations from “Profiles of the Founder”, mainly relating to the admissions by the students themselves that they had difficulty understanding the teachings of the Founder.
Yasuo Kobayashi was one of those interviewed.
I first met them in the late 1980's at a ASU training camp in Boulder. Later on, I trained with a group in Japan that was loosely affiliated with Kobayashi Dojo.
Members of Hasegawa Dojo with Yasuo Kobayashi and
Moriteru Ueshiba Doshu in Iwama
They always impressed me as being direct and down to earth, and their interview reflects that:
Q: What was your impression of when you received instruction or techniques from the Founder.
A: When I was being taught O-Sensei was in their 70's, and still had plenty of physical power. In Iwama they could still lift bags of rice easily. They were short with broad shoulders and a powerful build. Their eyes would be especially sharp when they were holding a bokken or jo. When being thrown by O-Sensei power would be added to the center of your body. When we were thrown in normal practice it would feel like a ball bouncing, but only with O-Sensei it would feel as if we were being crushed when being thrown. That was extremely mysterious. O-Sensei would only show technique, with barely any explanation. They would often speak of the Kojiki or Omoto-kyo, but unfortunately for me understanding the content was like trying to grab clouds. At the time all I could think was “When is they going to start moving?” (laughs). When I recall it now I wish that I had listened more at the time.
In this short section from Kobayashi we see three important points:
OーSensei gave little or no explanation when instructing. Of course, this contributed to to the problem of transmission discussed above. What explanations were given were coached in such esoteric language as to be virtually incomprehensible to the students, most of whom had neither the background nor the interest to dissect what they were saying in order to get at the salient points. We see Kobayashi describing a clear difference between how it felt to have the Founder throw you as opposed to having other people throw you in normal practice.
This last one is especially interesting, since it shows the result of points one and two above. This is not an unusual theme among the students of the Founder – Seiichi Sugano put it this way:
“It was as if O-Sensei was doing aikido while everyone else was doing something else.”
Now, here's the thing…
If you're studying something (anything) I can understand if your instructor is much more capable then you are, that's why they're the instructor. Even though they may be at a higher level it's clear, however, that you are doing essentially the same thing – this is especially true if you have been studying for some years and are yourself an instructor.
On the other hand, if, after all those years of intense study, it still appears that you are doing something completely different from what your instructor was doing – well, maybe you're right, maybe you are doing something different.
And that leads us to the second part of the problem, the problem of drift. Since the core of what people are doing has drifted away from the core practice of the Founder, there is now little to keep the training from spinning out of control.
We can see signs that things began to drift away from the core practices of the Founder early after the war in this section from Yasuo Kobayashi:
Q: Is that so – did that have the freestyle (jiyu-waza) demonstrations so common in Aikido at that time?
A: No, that began after the examination system was established. When the membership began to increase a system of kyu and dan examinations was instituted, and the uchi-deshi would take ukemi. However there were never more than around five uchi-deshi, so they could not partner up with the expanding number of students and the students were made to partner with each other for ukemi. At that time freestyle was added as an item on the examination. We held demonstrations from the time that I started, but since basic techniques alone were thought to be boring it was decided to show kokyu-nage as well. Until that time kokyu-nage was not done often in the dojo.
Q: Why was that?
A: O-Sensei did not like kokyu-nage very much. “What good is simply throwing around people like that?” was their thinking. However it was good for training, so it was added to the normal practice. Aiki-nage was much the same – behind the scenes of how freestyle became introduced these kinds of things happened. While we're discussing this, as far as I know koshi-nage was not practiced much in the beginning. After Nishio and Kuroiwa researched it independently other instructors began to steal their techniques.
You may think that the examples above are fairly harmless, and you'd be right – the instances above are all examples of things done with good intentions.
Not all of the changes were in the same vein – but that is not something that I'm going to get into here.
What I will say is that even changes made with the best of intentions, that seem small and harmless at the time, can very easily lead you down the garden path.
Now, am I saying that nobody got what O-Sensei was doing? Yes and no, it's not quite that simple.
Every direct student of the Founder that I've met (and I've met quite a few) seems to have gotten something from the Founder – some a little, and some a lot.
Virtually without exception, however, these students got what they got by the feel of working directly with the Founder, hand to hand. Because of this, those that got what they got seem to share an inability to comprehend exactly what it is that they got, how to explain it, and how to pass it on in turn to their students.
The results, a gradual and steady degradation of skill, ability and knowledge, are plain to see now that there are four or five generations of teachers descending from the Founder, for those who are honest enough to admit it.
It's just not enough to be able to do, when the art itself is considered. Equally important are the ability to understand, and the ability and willingness to pass on those skills and knowledge.
It's still not too late, I think, there are a small but growing number of people who are working towards reviving the legacy of the Founder – but time is certainly running short.

Jurgen Klinsmann led Germany to third place at the 2006 World Cup
Former Germany player and boss Jurgen Klinsmann has been sacked as coach of the United States.
The 52-year-old, who won the World Cup as a player with Germany in 1990, took over as US boss in 2011.
"We remain confident we have quality players to help us advance to Russia 2018," said US Soccer president Sunil Gulati.
"But the form and growth of the team up to this point left us convinced that we need to go in a different direction."
Klinsmann steered the United States to the last 16 at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil after finishing above Portugal in their group.
However, they lost 2-1 at home to Mexico and 4-0 away to Costa Rica in their opening two qualifying matches for the 2018 tournament.
The US are pointless and bottom of the six-country qualifying group, below the likes of Panama and Honduras, albeit only a fifth of the way through the qualifying process.
"With the next qualifying match in late March, we have several months to refocus," added Gulati.
"We need to determine the best way forward to ensure a successful journey to qualify for our eighth consecutive World Cup."
Former Tottenham striker Klinsmann was linked with the England job after Sam Allardyce left their post in September.
Analysis: 'Rift proved Klinsmann's downfall'
USA Today sports correspondent Martin Rodgers on BBC Radio 5 live:
Klinsmann has had some decent results as US head coach but ultimately too many setbacks and this was the time to pull the plug.
It now looks like Bruce Arena, the former US coach, most recently of LA Galaxy, will take over. Arena was head coach between 1998 and 2006 and maybe it is time to go back and do things the American way.
I think it's an admission that the experiment with Klinsmann didn't work. Everyone remembers what they did with Germany in 2006 and the free flowing and attacking football they played.
People expected them to come in and do the same with the US. The problem is the US is not blessed with the same kind of players as that Germany squad - or any Germany squad.
That's really where the downfall came. The way Klinsmann wanted to play, the players they had couldn't play that way.
It created tension within the camp and it created a little bit of a rift between some of the German-American players they had brought in and some of the more traditional American players.
How can Texas rank last in the nation — 51st — in the percentage of adults with high school diplomas, and simultaneously rank 22nd in the percentage attending at least some college?
The complicated answer involves more than the quality of the K-12 education system. The figures, based on the percentage of adults over 25 years old with various levels of education, come from a review of 2008 census bureau data by the Brookings Institution, which put data on education attainment from every state into this nifty web widget. It came as part of a larger study called the State of Metropolitan America, released in May (which includes some other interesting data on Texas cities).
In a ranking of the 50 states plus Washington, D.C. in educational attainment, Texas was all over the map: 51st in high school (79.6 percent); 22nd in some college (22.6 percent); 44th in associate's degrees (6.3 percent); 31st in bachelor's degrees (25.3 percent); and 36th in graduate degrees (8.3 percent). The leading factor driving down the state's rankings has little to do with the quality of public schools and everything to do with the rapid rate of immigration, said Alan Berube, senior fellow and research director at Brookings, a left-leaning policy think-tank.
Many Mexican and Latin American immigrants “came to Texas as adults. They didn't come there to finish high school. They came there to work. So that depresses the indicator,” Berube says. Further, the wide gap between high school and college attainment indicates a relatively large percentage of Texans who do complete high school go on to college, with many graduating, they say.
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
The same trends can be seen in California — the other huge state with rapid growth in immigration — with an even more severe spread between high school and college attainment. The sunshine state ranked 49th in high school attainment, yet 15th and 16th, respectively, in the percentage of adults with bachelor's and graduate degrees.
In addition, the rankings can be deceiving because almost every state in the nation is clustered between 80 and 90 percent, so the state ranking last isn't necessarily so far behind others ranking much higher. “But somebody's got to be 51st,” Berube said, “and it turns out that's Texas.”
At the same time, Houston, Austin and Dallas are three among only nine cities in America with the rare combination of fast growth, high levels of ethnic diversity and high educational attainment, Berube said. San Antonio, El Paso and McAllen, unfortunately, have the fast growth and diversity — but low educational attainment.
While some of the data should give policymakers concerns, none of it should be interpreted as solely a failure of the Texas education system, Berube said. Many Texas adults grew up elsewhere, and fast growth in Texas cities speaks for itself — people who live elsewhere want to move here. As for education levels, the real demographic shift will come when today's second- and third-graders — who are Hispanic and low-income in higher percentages than today's Texas teenagers — get into high school. In 2008, the Hispanic population represented 36 percent of all Texans, but 46 percent of births, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. The latest enrollment report from the Texas Education Agency, from the 2008-09 school year, shows that Hispanic students now account for 48 percent of public school enrollment — and 65 percent of pre-kindergarten enrollment.
How Texas public schools perform in educating these students — many from Spanish-speaking families without a history of high school and college graduation — largely will determine the future prosperity of the state. The current levels of educational attainment are “certainly something to be concerned about,” Berube said. “But the focus should be more properly on how the schools are doing with the children of these immigrants.”

Tobias Baumann is the director of game development for Perception Neuron, which is an IMU-based motion capture system. It might eventually be used as a VR input device, but Tobias acknowledges that the current price for the full system is a bit steep to be used for anything than a motion capture system at first.
The 32-sensor based full-body suit with finger-tracking runs at $1,499, and the 18-sensor full-body without fingers has an academic price of $799. The single hand version is more affordable for $100, and a two-handed option available for $200.
The Perception Neuron kickstarter more doubled their funding goal of $250k, and are getting ready to ship out their rewards within the next couple of weeks.
In the interview Tobias talks about:
The mechanics of how their wireless IMU-tracking system works and how it's mapped to an inverse kinematic skeletal model
A bit of the history of Perception Neuron & how they first got involved
Some of the preliminary prototypes and design issues in grabbing virtual objects
Space requirements for roaming freely and cautions about Gear VR locomotion issues
The production pipeline for using Perception Neuron for motion capture and the Unity plug-in & Perception Access data capture software
Rigging considerations for getting Perception Neuron to work with motion retargeting
Hopes that it might eventually be cheaper to be used a viable VR input device
Finally, Tobias talks a bit about how they first got into VR and how they got involved with the Perception Neuron project.

You've got to give Anthony Scaramucci some credit. The former hedge-fund manager—and, yes, Goldman Sachs alumnus—is now Donald Trump's new communications director, whatever that turns out to mean in this unconventional administration. Will they replace the departed Sean Spicer as the one delivering the overall message on the Sunday morning shows? Or is they angling to replace their nemesis Reince Priebus, who tried to thwart Scaramucci as chief of staff? Or, hell, is they going to just take over the entire cabinet? As one top White House official told Politico on Friday morning, “This was a murdering of Reince and Bannon. They said Anthony would get this job over their dead bodies.” And yet it happened nevertheless. Anyway, these are questions only they and Trump can answer.
In the meantime, as this is getting sorted out, you have got to acknowledge Scaramucci's chutzpah and determination. It has now paid off bigly, assuming that you think being in the white-hot center of the Trump administration is a just reward for someone who is a decent, honest, and hardworking guy. Some would say that saddling Scaramucci with Trump's mishegas is more torture than one man deserves to endure. But not Anthony Scaramucci! They could not be more thrilled. According to a source with knowledge, they are said to be “pumped” about their new appointment.
This doesn't surprise me. I've known The Mooch for years, interviewed them many times and enjoyed their company repeatedly at their annual SALT conference in Las Vegas, which has become one of the premier hedge-fund conferences in the industry, at least if you want to see and be seen. After failed forays supporting Scott Walker and Jeb Bush, Scaramucci decided last year to go all in for Donald Trump and now he's finally got what he's apparently been angling for since November 8: a seat at the big-boy table in the Trump administration.
WATCH: Meet the People Enabling Donald Trump
It wasn't easy. Early on, it appeared that Scaramucci was going to become the liaison between the White House and the business community. But since their deal to sell their stake in SkyBridge Capital, their $13 billion hedge fund of funds, to HNA, a large Chinese conglomerate, had not closed, they were prevented from taking a significant job. So Scaramucci laid low, and remained a good soldier. They made numerous television appearances defending the president's appalling behavior and questionable legislative decisions. They remained excruciatingly loyal.
As it looked like the SkyBridge deal was getting nearer to closing—it still hasn't—Scaramucci took a temporary job at the Export-Import Bank, which Trump had once slated to close, but then had a change of heart. Scaramucci presumably knew it was a temporary job, but they showed up and did what they were asked to do. The idea was that when the SkyBridge deal closed, they would head to France as the Ambassador for the Organization of Economic Co-Operation and Development. The O.E.C.D. job would present two nice perks. It would have given them a role, if minor, in the Trump administration. It also would have allowed them to defer the taxable gains they get from the sale of SkyBridge. (This huge tax benefit is available to nearly anyone goes from the private sector into government.) “Please visit,” they e-mailed me on July 5.
This carefully crafted plan, however, appeared to change again recently in the wake of Scaramucci's performance in calling out CNN—one of Trump's least favorite media outlets—for linking them to the Russia related investigations. Three senior CNN journalists ended up resigning after Scaramucci's pushback against the article, which reportedly included the threat of a $100 million suit if the story was not retracted. CNN did as they wished, and they thanked the organization publicly. “CNN did the right thing,” they tweeted. “Classy move. Apology accepted. Everyone makes mistakes, moving on.”
Around this time, it seemed, another door was coincidentally opening up for The Mooch. On May 30, White House communications director Michael Dubke resigned. Meanwhile, as Spicer's shop never appeared to meet the level of street-fighting antagonism demanded by Trump and Jared Kushner, some seemed to rejoice in The Mooch's defiance during the CNN episode. According to the New York Post, The Mooch was treated like a “star” at Steve Mnuchin's wedding, shortly after the scrape transpired. Then, earlier this week, Scaramucci met with Trump in the White House to make it official. For Scaramucci, entering the White House was perhaps a dream come true. Despite attending Harvard, working at Goldman and launching SkyBridge, they remain at heart a working-class guy from the north shore of Long Island. Their family owned a tough-guy motorcycle shop. They accepted.
The New Orleans Pelicans made some changes to the roster this offseason and are expected to be a fully functional unit for the first time in years at the start of a campaign, but ESPN's 2017 Summer Forecast believes the bust potential remains higher than ever.
The first problem in their eyes is the addition of Rajon Rondo. ESPN has ranked them as the third worst newcomer to a team based on their history and their uncertainty on how the experiment in New Orleans will unfold.
Then, in addition to Rondo, ESPN is concerned about the repercussions of another potential slow start, the attempt to play through both Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins in the small ball era and Jrue Holiday's move to shooting guard.
One year ago, ESPN was much more hopeful about New Orleans prospects, ranking them in a tie for fourth to have the biggest turnaround. Well, we certainly had front row seats to that dumpster fire of a prediction, so maybe they're just as likely to miss the mark by a wide margin again?
Personally, I think it's just too easy to see the faults of a team in this type of exercise, one that throws hot takes and worst case scenarios into a subjective bag and then swirls it around. I could do the same thing for the other 29 teams in the association.
There is no denying Cousins and Rondo have not helped matters at one time or another, but isn't it more important to have a stronger analytical approach in making such determinations? I give more credence to what Boogie did on the floor in their short stint last season with the Pelicans or that a Dwyane Wade, Jimmy Butler and Rondo starting trio was a bad idea from the start for the Chicago Bulls.
When Cousins was surrounded by Anthony Davis, Solomon Hill and Holiday last season, the group was an effective force and now they're surrounded by more legitimate talent. And as far as their destabilizing personal conduct, Boogie picked up just one technical foul in 17 games for the Pelicans and their relationships with Dell Demps and Alvin Gentry appear on fantastic footing.
Meanwhile, Rondo's floor general skills and lack of a potent three-point shot should not conflict nearly as much next to Holiday and Hill as it did alongside Wade and Butler. The Pelicans have been a team starved for high IQ and solid decision-making for some time. Then when you factor in the presence of those known to be able to communicate with Rondo — like Darren Erman and Boogie — shouldn't it lessen the chances of the point guard going rogue?
Make no mistake, I fully understand the risks, but I also firmly believe the evidence has not been properly weighted in this opinion. I mean, seriously, the Los Angeles Lakers made the 2017 Team Turnaround list! Hey, I like Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram for a lot further down the road, but I can't be alone in thinking that the Pelicans have a better chance of improving on their 34-win total from last season than the Lakers do on their 26 wins, right???

MANILA, Philippines – For the third time in the 2016 PBA Commissioner's Cup, Alaska forward Calvin Abueva has been named the Player of the Week after yet another excellent performance for the Aces.
Abueva was at the forefront of Alaska's 100-92 victory over the Star Hotshots last Saturday in Davao, scoring nine of their team-high 21 points in the final six minutes of the game to help their team snap a two-game skid.
They also added six rebounds in the contest, which allowed Alaska to formally claim a seat in the quarterfinals of the Commissioner's Cup.
Abueva is averaging a career-high 16.56 points per game this conference, along with 7.89 rebounds, and 3.33 assists.
"The Beast" edged Ginebra's Greg Slaughter and Chris Ellis, Meralco's Cliff Hodge, Tropang TNT's Troy Rosario, Rain or Shine's Jeff Chan, and NLEX's Sean Anthony for the award for the period of March 28 to April 3.
Abueva had previously been named the Player of the Week for the period of February 22-28, and March 7-13.

Japanese researchers showed monkeys a number of images representing various glosses and then they measured the responses of 39 neurons by using microelectrodes. They found that a specific population of neurons changed the intensities of the responses linearly according to either the contrast-of-highlight, sharpness-of-highlight, or brightness of the object. This shows that these 3 perceptual parameters are used as parameters when the brain recognizes a variety of glosses. They also found that different parameters are represented by different populations of neurons. This was published in the Journal of Neuroscience.
The gloss of an object surface provides information about the condition of that object. For instance, whether it is wet or dry, whether food is fresh or old. Several gloss-related physical parameters such as specular reflectance and diffuse reflectance have been described and used in computer graphics so far. However, the parameters used when neurons respond to gloss have not yet been found.
A Japanese research group led by Hidehiko Komatsu, professor of the National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS), National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS), in collaboration with the Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International (ATR) prepared 16 images representing various glosses and showed them to monkeys. In a circumscribed area in the inferior temporal cortex of the brain, neurons strengthened their responses proportionately as the contrast-of-highlight and/or sharpness-of-highlight got higher. Neural responses also vary greatly depending on the brightness, for instance, whether the object is black, gray, or white. Furthermore, the perceptual gloss parameters of the presented image could be fairly precisely predicted from the strengths of the population neural responses.
By the application of these findings in an artificial image recognition system, the researchers are expecting that it would be able to develop robots that recognize gloss like humans.
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The heads of the Ohio EPA and the Great Lakes Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have debated over the past week the source, significance, and urgency of a mass of toxic sediment located in Lake Erie, offshore from Cleveland.
EPA Director Craig Butler said the two-square mile polluted expanse, known as Area 1, contains dangerously high levels of PCBs and PAHs, and has been migrating over the past four decades to within five miles of a water intake site for the Cleveland Water Department.
Brigadier General Richard Kaiser responded in a news release and letter to Butler this week denying that the toxic sediment in Area 1 was migrating or that it posed any threat to the city's water intake site. They said the EPA's testing methods and reports were "critically flawed."
Kaiser said the polluted mass of sediment is the EPA's responsibility. Butler said the Army Corps placed the dredged sediment there in the years prior to the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, and it's the corps' duty to clean it up.
Both agencies have tested the sediment in the toxic site and both found elevated levels of PCBs and PAHs much higher than elsewhere in Lake Erie, an EPA official said.
The Army Corps has proposed "capping" Area 1 this year with freshly dredged sediment from the Cleveland shipping channel that it has said is clean enough for open-lake disposal.
To sort through the facts and theories behind that argument, The Plain Dealer gathered information from both sides on some of the key questions.
Q: What evidence says that the toxic field is moving?
Butler: "Based on the sampling the EPA conducted in 2014 and 2015, we think the data clearly shows a migration of contaminated sediment outside the original boundaries that the Army Corps had presented as Area 1."
Kaiser: "No credible scientific evidence supports the hypothesis that a 'toxic blob' is migrating towards Cleveland's water intakes.... Based on our thorough evaluation of sediment data and the location and characteristics of Area 1, we firmly believe that the lake bottom sediment in this area is not migrating nor does it pose a risk to Cleveland's drinking water now, or in the future."
Kaiser also acknowledged that the EPA had found elevated levels of contaminants "adjacent to" the original dumping ground.
Butler said the EPA knows of no possible source for that contamination other than previous dumping by the Corps. They added that the Corps, on its own web site, cites areas where they disposed of dredged material as being "disbursive in nature."
Q: What is the risk of the contaminants moving toward the city's water intake?
Kaiser: "Area 1 is an area two-square miles in size, and is located nine miles from the shoreline, in about 60 feet of water and is miles downstream of, and in much deeper water than Cleveland's water intakes."
Butler: "The water intake at risk is shallower than where the sediment is. But the Army Corps is trying to make an argument that the sediment would have to move uphill to reach the intake. We believe it's going to move wherever the storms or the currents move it... The lake is this dynamic system with currents, wave action and storms. It is our belief that it is fair to expect sediment to move in a dynamic lake environment."
Kaiser's scientists have assured them that waves cannot influence the sediment at 60 feet, the depth of Area 1, except during extreme storm events. Even then, the water current is not strong enough to meaningfully move the sediment.
Q: What concerns do you have about contaminants actually polluting the city's drinking water?
Butler: Tests show the city's raw water and treated water is safe and clean. If the contaminated sediment were to reach the intake, Cleveland has a treatment process designed to remove these types of contaminants with filters and larger amounts of chemicals. This would impose additional costs on the water system, but it would effectively filter out the contaminants.
Kaiser: "It is important to know that there is no credible scientific evidence concluding that it has ever posed a danger to Cleveland's drinking water."
Kaiser cites their own experts who reviewed the EPA report on Area 1 and found it to be critically flawed. The report failed to take into account sediment erosion, deposition and density, and other conditions specific to this area of Lake Erie, their experts said.
Q: If the toxic mass is migrating toward the city's water intake, how soon might this happen?
Butler: "That is the precise question we need answered. We have time to come up with a remedy and we need to work together. The Army Corps owes it to Ohio and the citizens of Cleveland to go find out. And not say, 'It's on your bottom of the lake and it's not our problem.'"
Kaiser: "While the Army Corps will not characterize and address contaminants of unknown sources in the entire lake bottom, it will support as appropriate any efforts by the Ohio EPA, as the owner of the lake bottom, to investigate the source of the contaminants and build a science-based understanding of their impacts."
Q: What are your primary concerns here?
Butler: "Public safety and the safety of the drinking water. It is our belief this material was placed there by the Army Corps before the Clean Water Act regulations existed. But that does not relieve the Army Corps of their responsibility to clean it up."
Kaiser: "On Saturday, April 30, 2016, The Cleveland Plain Dealer published an article titled 'Cleveland's water supply at risk as toxic blob creeps across Lake Erie, Ohio EPA says.' The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is fully committed to working with the Ohio EPA and other state and federal agencies to ensure that headline never becomes a reality."
Q: What is going to happen next?
Butler: "This is a long-term concern. It can't wait. We need to do it now. My intention is to reach out to our partners with U.S. EPA to go out and do more testing. Whether the Army Corps wants to join us is up to them. We're not going to wait."
Kaiser: "As per previous correspondence from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on March 10 and 21, 2016, we continue to advocate for a collaborative, science-based discussion with the Ohio EPA."
On Monday, security company Intego warned Mac users of a new Trojan horse that masquerades as a Flash Player installation package for OS X Lion.
Intego reported that the Flashback malware is available on some sites that offer a link or icon to install Flash Player; Lion users may be vulnerable to the scam because the operating system doesn't automatically include Flash. If users do click on the malicious link in Safari—launching the Mac OS X Installer—the software deactivates some security code, then deletes the original installation package. The malware then sends information about the infected Mac back to a remote server. Intego analysts are still investigating Flashback's purposes.
Protecting your Mac from this Flashback is relatively easy: Only download Flash from Adobe.com.
Monday's announcement is the second Trojan horse warning to Mac users in the last week. On Friday, security firm F-Secure warned against Trojan-Dropper:OSX/Revir.A, which appears as a Chinese-language PDF; open it up, and a backdoor connection to a remote server is made.
As Macworld's Serenity Caldwell noted after Friday's warning about the PDF malware, one way for Mac users—particularly those who use Safari—to avoid a problem with Trojan horse malware is to uncheck Safari's Open ‘Safe' Files After Downloading option (Safari -> Preferences -> General); then, as long as you practice common sense computing, you should be safe from most malicious attacks. You should also be sure to keep your OS X malware definitions up to date.
SINGAPORE - Singapore's first Hello Kitty-themed cafe opened on Thursday (May 12), drawing hundreds of people to Changi Airport's Terminal 3. Some were in the queue at 7am, many hours before the 11.30am opening time.
The 84-seat Hello Kitty Orchid Garden Cafe, with Hello Kitty shaped furniture, pays tribute to the popular character, part of Japanese company Sanrio's roster of cute creatures. Diners can head to a photo-taking area with a statuette of the cat.
First in line were Ms Maureen Setyadi, in their 30s, and Ms Jaden Ang, in their 20s. They made a trip to the airport at 11pm on Wednesday to check out the cafe.

"We are very big fans of Hello Kitty. We also queued for Hello Kitty plush toys at McDonald's," said Ms Setyadi, who is unemployed.
They were given a plush toy and their friend received a postcard, as gifts for being the cafe's first customers.
The cafe is also the world's first Hello Kitty-themed cafe that is open round the clock, and is located in the public area of Changi Terminal 3.
It has a retail section which sells merchandise featuring the cat. Also available are 500 limited-edition plush toys designed for Singapore, which cost $49.90 each.
Hello Kitty sports a red and white striped bow, echoing the colours of the Singapore flag.
Ms Mandy Liew, 58, who visited the cafe with their husband, bought four of the plush toys.
"I just love Hello Kitty so much. My cups, bedsheets and curtains are all Hello Kitty-themed," they said.
When asked if they were going to sell their plush toys, they said: "No, of course not. I will display them at home."
Engineer Anne Lee, 36, said they have been a fan since they were a child. They queued for four hours to get into the cafe. They added that they have all the limited-edition Hello Kitty collectibles. They and their boyfriend snapped up four of the plush toys.
"I live in Yishun and woke up at 6am to get here early," they added.
Dishes on the menu are Singapore-inspired, such as the wagyu beef rendang. Prices of main course dishes range from $15 to $24.
Many customers The Straits Time spoke to said they enjoyed the food.
Ms Ki Ki Leong, 33, a hawker assistant, said: "The food here tastes better than what's offered in other Hello Kitty cafes in Thailand and Korea, and it is affordably priced. I will definitely be back again."
Holly Holm wasn't supposed to beat Ronda Rousey. They aren't even supposed to survive for more than a round or two. Expectations didn't stop them from putting on the performance of a lifetime, however, and their training and preparation seemed absolutely flawless.
On the other end of the bout, Ronda Rousey had an unbelievable amount of trouble with Holly Holm. The loss highlighted some of the flaws in their game, particularly in their boxing. Rousey has trained their hands diligently at Glendale Fight Club under coach Edmond Tarverdyan, but there is reason to doubt the effectiveness of this training. On this week's episode of Heavy Hands, we talk about the changes Rousey will need to make in order to prevent a repeat of this result when they rematch Holm--and a change of camp just might be at the top of that list.
After that, it's on to the co-main event, in which strawweight champion Joanna Jedrzejczyk showed off their adaptability against an unexpectedly tough challenger, despite breaking their right hand early in the fight.

It didn't take the political establishment long to adapt to the outpourings of public sympathy for the refugees. The initial limit of 600 was quickly upped to 1,800 when Fine Gael spokespersons were asked about the numbers of refugees that Ireland would accept. Not to be outdone, Labour leader, Joan Burton, mentioned a figure of 5,000.
Across the water, David Cameron also executed a swift U-turn when they saw that the public mood had switched from hostility to compassion for the distressed migrants. Cameron knows that this is the most sensitive of political issues and one which could figure large in the forthcoming EU referendum.  They are keeping a watchful eye on Nigel Farage who set out their stall in typically uncompromising style on Sky News. UKIP is opposed to further immigration because, while it might contribute to increased economic growth, it will register negatively on ‘quality of life', an argument designed to appeal to all those conservationist Tories with their Range Rovers and Barbour waxed jackets. They certainly don't want an increase in population to 80 million people – the figure casually thrown out by Farage – in an already densely populated country.
And this is where a curious and uncomfortable alignment occurs between the ideas of these reactionary forces and so‐called deep green thinkers. Consider for a moment the Malthusian ravings of Dr William Stanton from ten years ago: individual citizens, and aliens must expect to be seriously inconvenienced by the single-minded drive to reduce population ahead of resource shortage. The consolation is that the alternative: letting nature take its course, would be so much worse.
The scenario is: immigration is banned. Unauthorised arrivals are treated as criminals. Every woman is entitled to raise one healthy child. No religious or cultural exceptions can be made, but entitlements can be traded. Abortion or infanticide is compulsory if the foetus or baby proves to be handicapped. When, through old age, accident or disease, an individual becomes more of a burden than a benefit to society, their or their life is humanely ended. Voluntary euthanasia is legal and made easy. Imprisonment is rare, replaced by corporal punishment for lesser offences and painless capital punishment for greater.
We shouldn't distract ourselves for too long with the dystopian vision of Dr Stanton, but there are saner voices who have warned about the influence of resource depletion and climate change on global migration patterns. According to UN estimates, if our current population growth continues with normal ‘demographic drivers' there could be between 235 and 415 million international migrants in the world by 2050. However, climate change increases the potential for additional mass migration. The Stern Report (2007) put this figure at an additional 200 million, whereas a Christian Aid report of the same year came up with the more alarming figure of an additional one billion migrants as a result of the climate crisis.
The current Syrian refugee crisis is ostensibly the result of a complex civil war, but a recent report by the National Academy of Sciences concludes that the severe drought between 2007 and 2010 contributed to the conflict. It resulted in the migration of traditional farming families – about 1.5 million people – to urban areas where they found it difficult to find work, leading in turn to civil unrest. Scientists have also suggested that climate change may have played a role in the drought in north Africa that led to increases in food prices, and sparking the discontent of the Arab Spring.
Similarly, another UN Report concluded that climate change had played a role in the Darfur conflict.
The accumulating evidence points in one direction: the current migration crisis is not a temporary phenomenon, but the ‘new normal', with the potential to become a defining and deeply polarising issue.
Angela Merkel knows that the public mood can change very quickly. So far, the Germans are happy to accept tens of thousands of well-educated Syrians who, no doubt, will contribute meaningfully to the German demography and economy; but would they be as welcoming of poor black Africans with few qualifications?
Pegida and the AfD in Germany and the emergence of far right nationalist parties in Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands betoken a racist undercurrent in these liberal countries.
No such parties have succeeded in Ireland. That's not to say that the Irish are morally superior or that the same disdain for migrants does not exist here. Most TDs will tell you that many Irish voters express concern about the numbers of migrants.
According to one survey, up to 70% of Sinn Féin supporters believed there were ‘too many' migrants. Sinn Féin, to their credit, have never attempted to make political capital from this disquiet. But now that one in eight people in this state are non-national, well above the Western average and considerably higher than in Britain, migration will rise to the top of the Irish political agenda.
Migration, the concomitant of climate change, is set to challenge our moral certainties in the most unimaginable way. •
Destro risks video evidence ban
By Football Italia staff
Roma forward Mattia Destro risks a ban using video evidence and the FIGC confirm they could fall foul of Italy's Code of Ethics.
Destro scored a hat-trick in Sunday's 3-1 win at Cagliari, but was involved in a controversial incident with Davide Astori.
The striker appeared to run into the back of Astori and lash out an arm, but it was the Cagliari defender who was booked.
It is now reported that FIGC Disciplinary Commission has put in a request for video evidence of the incident.
In recent weeks lashing out in similar scenarios resulted in three-match Serie A bans, but could also have repercussions for the World Cup squad.
“Those who have to verify the game will judge, then Cesare Prandelli will make their evaluations,” Federation President Giancarlo Abete told La Gazzetta dello Sport.
“These incidents shouldn't happen, but Prandelli will judge regardless of what the Disciplinary Commission says, just as they did with Daniele De Rossi.
“There are some problems for Prandelli at the moment, as there is an explosion of young talent, so the next tests will be important looking at the complex environmental conditions in Brazil.”
Destro also commented on the footage of their tussle with Astori on Sunday.
“There was contact and they put their arm out first. My eyes were closed, so I couldn't even see where they are. In fact, I think they were booked for the reaction rather than the coming together with me. Besides, Astori is a friend.”
Robbie Gray walks into battle again in 2015. Their second John Cahill Medal came on the back of another incredible season.
ROBBIE Gray has become just the third man to win multiple John Cahill Medals as Port Adelaide's best and fairest AFL player after narrowly beating home Chad Wingard in the 2015 count on Saturday night.
Gray won their second consecutive John Cahill Medal, holding off a fast-finishing Chad Wingard in the final rounds of the count.
In fact, had Wingard polled better in the Power's final game against Fremantle, the margin would have been within single digits in either's favour.
Wingard came within one vote of Gray after the Power's Round 22 win over Gold Coast.
KRAKOUER: Defender wins John McCarthy Award
But Gray was undeniably the most consistent Port player of the year, polling strongly in every game they played to net the coveted award at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre.
As a result of their 2015 achievement, Gray joins Kane Cornes and Warren Tredrea as the third multiple winner of the John Cahill Medal.
They credited their teammates for their work on the field in 2015, saying their achievement wouldn't be possible without the continual push he's given by the men with whom they share the responsbility of wearing a common Port Adelaide guernsey.
“You don't get these sorts of things without lots of hard work, but much of it comes from your teammates' work,” Gray told portadelaidefc.com.au.
“You don't just get your hands on the ball yourself, you need the help of others, and the support of others, to have them keep on pushing you.
“I'm lucky I get to run around with these guys every day, and just play footy and enjoy playing footy.
“We're not about individuals, you've got to have the help of others to even get close to something like this.”
LIFE MEMBERS: Logan, Carlile and Summerton given club's most prestigious membership
A tight race to the finish
Jack Hombsch finished third in the count after a strong and consistent start to the year, which saw them lead the count at one point.
It is the first time Hombsch has finished inside the top three, with many considering them a frontrunner for the award midway through the season.
Power skipper Travis Boak was fourth in the count after earlier winning the Fos Williams Medal, while Justin Westhoff rounded out the top five after a consistent finish to the year.
WINES: Another Gavin Wanganeen Medal
Brad Ebert was again the early leader in the vote count, however fell away like many teammates through the middle of the season.
Matthew Broadbent, Hamish Hartlett, Paddy Ryder and Ollie Wines rounded out the top ten.

In the wake of the great Tim Duncan announcing their retirement on Monday, let's take a look back on how their ex-wife cost the Orlando Magic a chance at signing Duncan and changing the course of NBA history.
Here's a column, I wrote about it a few years ago:
Tim Duncan divorce reminds Magic of their broken home
It was just a short blurb on most websites a few days ago.
"Tim Duncan and wife Amy are getting a divorce."
For Orlando Magic fans, the breakup happened about a dozen years too late.
If not for Duncan's love affair with Amy, the San Antonio Spurs may be the Magic and the Magic may be the Spurs. The NBA's balance of power over the last decade might be completely different, and the Magic perhaps would have multiple championship banners hanging in the Amway Center. And, who knows, the Spurs may be the worst team in the league and getting ready for the NBA draft lottery right now instead of the NBA Finals.
It all goes back to that fateful time at the turn of the century in the summer of 2000 when the Magic were courting three free agents – Duncan, Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady. It was an exciting period in Magic history – a time when Orlando was a destination point for free agents and former Magic GM John Gabriel had brilliantly cleared the cap space to pursue them.
Hill and Duncan – both clients of agent Lon Babby – visited Orlando together and were blown away by Gabriel, the Magic and the entire recruiting process.
When Duncan and Hill arrived for their visit, they were greeted at the airport by a banner half the size of a football field. On the banner was the Orlando version of Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam" that the great artist painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. The Orlando version had Duncan in a Magic uniform stretching down from heaven to touch hands with Hill in a Magic uniform. In between the two hands was the one-word message: "Believe."
During the visit, the two players were put up in the luxurious Eisner Suite in the palatial Grand Floridian hotel, and the entire city, it seems, was in on the plan to make them love Orlando. Disney gave the Magic after-hours access to the theme parks where Grant Hill and newlywed wife Tamia giddily rode Space Mountain over and over again. Duncan and Hill watched the fireworks at Epcot and were amazed at the end of the pyrotechnic display. Spelled out in lights on the big ball in the middle of the lake at Epcot was this message: "Grant Us Tim."
The next day was a pool party at Magic CEO Bob Vander Weide's 17,000-square-foot estate in Isleworth. The sprawling estate was surrounded by a pristine Florida landscape -- the 17th tee at Isleworth Country Club on one side and the picturesque Butler Chain of Lakes on the other. According to an account of the party by former Sentinel sportswriter Tim Povtak, there were 10 golf carts parked outside that would take everyone to the No. 5 tee box, where it just so happened (nudge, wink) that Tiger Woods was on the tee box. Woods greeted Hill and Duncan and then reportedly hit their shot on the par 3 to within inches of the hole. That's when Magic veteran Monty Williams cracked, "Tiger, you need to keep that arm a little straighter on your backswing."
Marc Scott, Duncan's personal assistant, told Duncan that evening, "Tim, this is where you need to be." Magic officials were beside themselves when Duncan canceled their flight the next morning and decided to stay another day to look at houses with a real estate agent. Babby, Duncan's agent, told Gabriel, "I think you guys are winning them over."
There was one problem, though; the Magic apparently weren't winning over Duncan's longtime girlfriend Amy Sherrill.
At the time, Sherrill asked Orlando Coach Doc Rivers if they would occasionally be allowed on team flights to games. Rivers reportedly informed them that, like most teams, only players and staff travel on the team plane. This reportedly did not sit well with Sherrill, who knew that Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich was agreeable to the occasional request from players to bring significant others and family members on road trips.
Sherrill apparently was not impressed with the Magic's policy or the recruiting trip in general. According to column written by the Sentinel's Brian Schmitz, after Amy spent some time on the visit with Kris Rivers, Doc's wife, the coach received an ominous phone call.
"I think," Kris told Doc, "you have a problem."
Duncan then flew back to San Antonio, where the Spurs put the full-court press on keeping him. David Robinson, the Spurs' other superstar, even cut their Hawaiian vacation short to fly back home and try and convince Duncan to stay.
Everybody knows the rest of the story. Hill signed with the Magic and spent seven snake-bit, injury-plagued years in Orlando. McGrady, too, signed and became yet another of the franchise's spoiled, disgruntled superstars.
Meanwhile, Duncan remained in San Antonio, where they have become one of the greatest NBA players of all-time and the cornerstone of the Spurs' four (now five) championships.
They would marry Amy Sherrill a short time after they returned on their recruiting trip from Orlando – a matrimonial union that is about to come to a messy end.
If anybody deserves alimony during this divorce, it's the Orlando Magic.
At the very least, they should get custody of at least a couple of San Antonio's championship trophies.
The Greek ambassador leaving Vienna on Thursday. Photo: epa
Greece's migration row with Austria intensified on Friday, with Athens refusing a visit from Austria's interior minister whom it accused of "falsifying the truth".
A foreign ministry source confirmed a report from Athens News Agency ANA that a visit request by Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner had been turned down. "We confirm the report," the source told AFP.
The snub came a day after Greece recalled its ambassador to Vienna for consultations in retaliation to Austria's decision to leave Athens out of a Balkans migration meeting this week.
Austria has repeatedly accused Greece of failing to police its borders properly and allowing an excessively high number of migrants to continue their journey northwards.
At a meeting of EU interior ministers on Thursday, Mikl-Leitner called into question Greece's place in the passport-free Schengen zone.
"If it is really the case that the Greek external border cannot be protected, can it be still a Schengen external border?" they wondered.
An angry Greek migration minister Yiannis Mouzalas later retorted that Mikl-Leitner was "falsifying the truth" and "dragging Austria into increasingly hostile acts towards Greece and the EU."
"Our country guards its borders, which are also Europe's borders, in the best possible way. This is a fact confirmed by (EU border agency) Frontex, the European Commission and other institutions," Mouzalas said in a statement.
The Austrian interior ministry said Mikl-Leitner told their Greek colleagues in Brussels that they could come to Greece "to explain Austria's position in detail directly".
The ministry said it remained available "if Greece prefers to conduct the conversation at a later stage".
Greece believes Austria has encouraged a series of border restrictions by Balkan states along the migrant trail to northern and western Europe that has caused a bottleneck on its soil.
Thousands of refugees have been stranded in Greece after Macedonia denied all passage to Afghans and ramped up document controls for Syrians and Iraqis.
On Friday, there were some 3,000 people waiting to cross at the border post of Idomeni and another 25 buses full of migrants parked a short distance away, local police said.
Macedonian police had only allowed some 150 people to cross since Thursday, Greek police said.
EU migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said the European Union's migration system could crumble if the number of migrants did not fall before a crucial meeting of EU leaders with Turkey in Brussels on March 7th.
Image caption Rick Astley shot to fame in the 1980s but is now out of the public eye
The White House has lightened the tone of the debt ceiling debate by joining an online craze known as "Rickrolling".
Responding to criticism during a Twitter chat, the White House offered users a link to "something more fun".
The link pointed to a YouTube video of UK pop singer Rick Astley's 1987 number one hit Never Gonna Give You Up.
Years of "Rickrolling", or duping web users into clicking a link to that song, has seen almost 36.5 million people watch Astley's YouTube video.
The White House was conducting an online chat it labelled "Office Hours" in an effort to connect to web users about the often dry issue of the debt and budget negotiations.
Brian Deese, deputy director of the National Economic Council, was taking questions from Twitter users via the official White House Twitter feed - followed by 2.3 million users.
After earnest discussion of the state of the economy, of the fate of the US budget and of the continuing negotiations to raise the debt ceiling, one contributor voiced concern over the tone of the tweets.
"This WHO correspondence briefing isn't nearly as entertaining as yesterday's. #SCOT #WHchat" wrote one user, David Wiggs, using popular hashtags at the end of their message to make sure their tweet was read by the White House.
Image caption The White House's tweet sent those following the conversation to Astley's video
Their observation prompted the White House's exhortation to do "something more fun".
Rick Astley rose to prominence in the UK in 1987 when Never Gonna Give You Up spent weeks at the top of the UK singles charts.
They enjoyed a period of success before fading from public view, only to re-emerge in 2008 as the craze for "Rickrolling" spread through the internet.
They have been reported to be happy and bemused by the adoption of their song by the web, but now refuses to give interviews or comment on the subject.
Still In Business
Their stock was plummeting. Their investors were dwindling. Lawsuits and inquiries were piling up. Every day, Aperture Science teetered on the brink of bankruptcy. And yet, somehow, Cave Johnson, current (and, if they had their way, the only) CEO, refused to give up. Damn them and their "safe", science, they would bark to their employees. If you like safe science so much, why don't you just marry it?
And yet, when all was said and done, safe science seemed to wind up with fewer class action lawsuits.
Cave mumbled bitterly under their breath as they reached for another sheaf of papers and rifled through them. Their office- by now a veritable nest of crumbled-up forms and old tax forms- had clearly seen better days; the linoleum was scuffed and dirty, their desk worn and scratched. “Lawsuit… lawsuit… union dues… lawsuit… resignation letters… health inspection… Caroline!” they finally shouted. “I need good news. Give me something to smile about. Anything.”
“Well, Mister Johnson,” replied their brunette assistant, walking into the room, “Test subject 704 managed to make it through enrichment sphere twelve in record time!” They smiled at them as they watched them hunched over their desk, eyes flickering from one crisply-worded formal inquiry to another.
“Mister Johnson?”
“Hm? Oh, yes, uh… Seven-oh-four… that was the one we found slumped outside the soup kitchen, right?” said Cave absent-mindedly, scarcely paying their assistant a wayward glance.
“That's right, Mister Johnson. The propulsion gel tests are right on schedule!”
“Thanks, Caroline,” said Johnson finally, gazing with what could only be dejection at the mountains of paperwork that lay ahead of him.
And so an hour- or perhaps two- passed uneventfully, before Caroline once again knocked on the door. Trepidation was on their face- they did hate to disturb their boss when they were in the middle of their work, but Cave could tell that something was wrong.
“Mister Johnson?”
“Yes, Caroline?”
“There are some people here to see you.”
“They're from the government? Worker's union? Health inspector?”
Caroline ducked outside again for a moment. Cave heard snatches of conversation –two males, apparently- before Caroline stepped back into the office.
“They say it's classified,”
Cave groaned inwardly and shuffled a few papers off of their desk. “Send ‘em in,” they finally said. There really was no point in trying to discourage these kinds of people; they would stubbornly get the facts somehow anyways.
The two men that stood before them were average in build and height; both carried identical leather briefcases and wore suits- Armani, Cave guessed. Both of them stood at their desk, fixing them with a look that Cave didn't like. It was a look that they had seen at the Senate hearings, and it was one that implied that stern judgement was on the way.
“Mr. Johnson?” said one of them, placing their briefcase among the discarded papers.
“Cave Johnson, CEO of Aperture Science Innovators,”
The other man nodded curtly. “For the purposes of this interview, we are to be called Mr. White-“ here, they pointed to himself, “and Mr. Brown. We do not, as it is, legally exist; if you attempt to alert any authorities to our existence you will fail.”
Cave bristled somewhat at these two presumptuous men, but nevertheless, common sense- and perhaps a healthy fear for their own wellbeing- prompted them to call for Caroline. “Either of you gentlemen smoke?” they asked. Neither of them did, but as Caroline bustled into the room, clutching a box of Cuban cigars, Cave took one and lit it, chewing on it as they listened to their two mysterious visitors.
“So how do you know me?” they asked, trying to keep the suspicion out of their voice. “Don't recall seeing either of you before.” Of course, they probably did know exactly which organization had sent these two, but intended to keep things civil- at least until they could ascertain just what they were really up to.
“The gel fiasco? The Senate hearings? Those missing astronauts? What happened in Test Chamber Twelve-”
“Now just hold on a damn minute,” whispered Cave, leaning closer to them. “What happened in Test Chamber Twelve never got out to the public. We made sure of that, and if you're leaking information to the public I swear that I will-”
“Oh, Mr. Johnson, please.” said White, smirking slightly at him, “We've had undercover agents in your company for years now.” They stopped for a moment, watching as the head of the company sputtered and stammered at him, trying to think of a response even as their brain gallantly attempted to process this latest revelation.
“You don't think those missing astronauts would draw attention to this company? Those Senate hearings were just a show- a distraction, if you will- while we did the real work. We know exactly what happened with those astronauts, Mr. Johnson, and we know that you have a lot of blood on your hands.”
Cave stood up, pointing an accusing finger at the two men. “So you're from the government, huh? Trying to stick your noses into scientific progress? Listen, you clowns, I'm no lawyer, but I know my rights, and I'm pretty sure that I can take you and whatever organization you work for straight to court!”
“It says here,” said Brown, riffling through a sheet of papers and procuring a small phial full of a blue gel, “that you developed this as a dietetic pudding substitute.” “Really, Mr. Johnson? This substance is many things, but it is not edible. We've tried to reproduce this thing in our labs, Mr. Johnson, to no avail. You've created a kinetic weapon that could easily kill a man.”
“What the- how the hell did you get that?” snapped the CEO, reaching over and snatching it from Brown's hand, hastily stuffing it into their pocket. “You know damn well that we pulled that stuff from the shelves as soon as we figured out what it did to the human skeleton. Aperture does not make weapons.”
This really was Black Mesa's doing, wasn't it? Send some corporate goons to rattle them up, try and trick them into spilling the beans on their company's latest invention? Well, they aren't going to play along with them.
“Why don't you go back and tell your CEO that Aperture's not for sale?” said Cave sharply, trying to regain their composure as they settled back into their chair. “So who sent you? Black Mesa? Builder's League United? Reliable Excavat-“
“None of those companies, Mr. Johnson,' said Brown, picking up a piece of paper at random and looking through it before placing it back on the desk. “I'm not at liberty to divulge that information at the moment. But I will tell you that we have our ways of gathering information."
"Yes, but what do you do? Damnit, stop dancing around the question and give me some straight facts.
"We… we find the things that are overlooked, the things that pose a threat to our society, and we contain them.”
“So you're going to try containing me?” laughed Johnson. It was a harsh, bitter laugh, the hoarse bark of too many nights up late trying to save an ailing company with everything around them slowly crumbling. “Well, I gotta warn you boys, I was a prize boxer in university and I don't go down without a fight!” They laughed again and lit another cigar, leaning back in their swivel chair and taking a long drag. “Gonna try and contain my facility? It's already at the bottom of a salt mine, there's no way that we can be any more contained!”
“Mr. Johnson,” said Brown, “don't be ridiculous. We're not here to lock you up."
“Even though,” put in White, “it's an option we've seriously considered.”
“Listen to us, Mr. Johnson. Our organization has technology that makes Aperture look like- as you say- people banging rocks together. We have some of the most highly trained medical and scientific personnel on the planet. You ever wonder, Mr. Johnson, why your bean-counters and lab-boys aren't up to snuff? It's because we've already taken the best of the best. You're an excellent manager, Johnson. We can guarantee you a cushy salary, flexible hours, a team of the greatest scientific minds in the world. You've built this entire facility from scratch, but don't you think it's time to move on?”
Cave paused. Was it time to finally lay Aperture to rest? The megalithic testing complex-perhaps on its last legs- bore no vestige of its origins as a humble shower company. They paused, realizing that the next words out of their mouth would impact the rest of their life forever. Even for a man as gung-ho as he, here, subtlety paid.
“Tell me… what kind of work do you do? What exactly do you keep contained?”
“Many things, Mr. Johnson,” said Brown, “things that are both wonderful and terrible. Sensitive things, that could be easily abused in the wrong hands.”
“Like what?"
Brown sighed, but nevertheless continued talking. “Ten years ago, a rocket crashed in the desert. It bore no resemblance to any contemporary rocket and incorporated unknown materials into its structure.”
“A- rocket from outer space?” Cave clenched their cigar and took another nervous puff on it. Their mind was reaching only one conclusion, and it both thrilled and horrified him. “You don't mean it was an al-“
“-The only thing we know about it,” interrupted Brown, “was that it was sent by someone named Doctor Grordbort. The rocket was full of technology- guns, helmets, weapons, and hats- far in advance of any Earth technology we are aware of- and out of all of the people on Earth who could have found it, it just had to be a team of mercenaries with a questionable grip on reality.”
“But don't you think they'd- wait, a sec."
“Exactly, Mr. Johnson,” said Brown, nodding curtly. “We made sure that nobody ever found out about Doctor Grordbort's rocket, or the mercenaries who found them. “And no, we're not proud of what we did that day. But we did these things for the good of all of us.”
Cave's patience was wearing thin by this point. “Yeah,” they grumbled, “except for the ones who're dead.” Lighting another cigar and chewing on it. All this business about Grordborts and moon rockets and mercenaries and secret foundations was wearing thin. Cave Johnson was many things- shower curtain salesperson extraordinaire, business tycoon, corporate mogul and legend, but they were not a murderer. Not a deliberate murderer, anyways. People getting hurt in tests was one thing, killing people for a living was quite another thing. No, Cave Johnson, the face of Aperture, had a company to rescue from bankruptcy and science to do.
“Gentlemen,” they said, finally. “you make a convincing offer. But I'm afraid that I still have unfinished business- and unfinished science- at Aperture. You'll have to find someone else to do your dirty work.”
“This is your only chance,” said Mr. White, their already curt tone now positively frosty. “You will not receive this offer again.”
“Thought as much,” said Cave, extinguishing the burning nub of their cigar in their ashtray. “But… you're a persuasive pair of gentlemen. I'm sure you'll find someone else to help you. Maybe Black Mesa?” They paused and allowed themselves a roguish grin. “No, that was a joke. Fat chance. They're all busy with some other project. Something about trying to find a crystal.”
“I understand,” said Mr. White, closing their briefcase with a succinct snap and making for the door. But before they turned to walk down the hall, they paused for one moment, regarding Cave with that cool glare of his. "Mr. Johnson, your company and Black Mesa are creating things not even they understand. Your Quantum Tunnelling Device? Analyzing crystals of unknown origin? Creating portals through an unknown dimension? If anything ever goes wrong with your inventions Mr. Johnson, then… well…”
White stopped for a moment. “… we'll be meeting one another again.”
“Caroline?”, said Cave.
“Yes, Mister Johnson?”
“I need a stiff drink.”
Please black conservatives, do not pander to Leftists' lies about our country in an attempt to prove your loyalty to your blackness
The Mistake of Pandering to Antifa/Black Lives Matter
I cringed when I heard fellow black conservatives whom I respect on TV saying that while they condemn the violent behavior of Antifa/Black Lives Matter, some of their grievances against America are warranted. I wanted to scream at my TV, “Hogwash!” These conservative blacks on TV are merely trying to create peace and civility by agreeing with some of the bogus accusations of racism dreamed up by Leftist intellectuals. They are also trying to prove they are not Uncle Toms. I think it is a huge mistake to pander to lies about America; acting as though very little has changed racially since the 1950s.
Everywhere you turn, American businesses and whites are walking on eggshells, pandering to blacks As a black person, I know the Black Code. It is the same as what Michael Corleone said to their brother Fredo, “Don't ever take sides against the family. Ever!” Many blacks and Leftists believe to qualify as an authentic black American, one must harbor a deep seated resentment against white America. Watching black conservatives on TV saying Antifa/Black Lives Matter have some legit grievances regarding white privilege, I found myself scratching my head. For the life of me, I have no idea what millennial blacks who have never suffered a moment of “real” racism in their lives are so enraged about; whining, complaining and destroying property. Let's get real folks. Since the election of Obama, being black is in vogue like never before. Everywhere you turn, American businesses and whites are walking on eggshells, pandering to blacks. This is an undeniable truth that I am not allowed to say out loud, especially as a black person. Leftists will verbally beat the crap out of me on social media. My 89-year-old black dad suffered “real” hardcore racism. They paved the way for these black ungrateful domestic terrorists created by Leftists' lies. After spending months at sea as a young Merchant Marine, Dad and the other black seaman were super excited about their much-needed shore leave when their ship landed in St Petersburg, Florida. Dad and their fellow black shipmate were heartbroken upon hearing that they had to stay on the ship because of St Petersburg's curfew for blacks. While their black shipmate went on a cussing rant, Dad said they cried.
Dad's weapons for defeating racism were their faith in God, prayer and striving for excellence When Dad was finally allowed to leave the ship, locals attempted to hang them just because they were black. Dad's life was saved by white shipmates. I remember when Dad was in their 50s, they met for dinner with an old white friend. I later learned it was one of the sailors who saved Dad's life. In 1957, blacks were finally permitted to take the test to become a Baltimore City Firefighter. Dad passed the test. Working conditions at the firehouse were horrific for Dad. They were not permitted to use the same eating utensils or drink from the same coffee pot as the white firefighters. Despite humiliating working conditions, Dad won Firefighter of the Year two times. Dad's weapons for defeating racism were their faith in God, prayer and striving for excellence. Over the years, Dad mentored numerous blacks into becoming firefighters. One of Dad's young black recruits became Anne Arundel County Maryland's first black Fire Chief. In the 1960s, an exclusive white country club offered free membership to Baltimore City firefighters. The club was stunned when Dad and my two younger brothers showed up. Dad said all the whites got out of the swimming pool when they and my brothers got in. Dad kept frequenting the club and the white members eventually got over it. Folks, I could go on and on with horrific tales of “real” racism blacks suffered back in the day. But praise God, this is a new day in America. While Leftists claim a majority of white Americans are racist, white America voted for the worst president in U.S. history http://bit.ly/1ZaTdzo two times because they were black. I know. I know. As a black person, blacks consider me disloyal to my race for telling the truth about Obama.
Is there racism in America? Is there racism in America? Absolutely, along with every other sin in the heart of man. Is there enough racism to stop anyone from achieving their American Dream? Absolutely not. America is the greatest land of opportunity on the planet for everyone who chooses to go for it. Anything else promoted by fake news media, democrats and Leftist Hollywood is a lie. Pure and simple. The loudest black voices trashing America are super wealthy Leftist blacks who could not have achieved their mega success without the enthusiastic support of white America. And yet, they are dissing our flag and national anthem. They are cheerleaders for the destruction of historical monuments and clamoring for us to throw out the U.S. Constitution. Shamefully, rich Leftist blacks are using urban blacks as pawns to further Leftists' socialist/progressive agenda. Colin Kaepernick is the pro football player who inspired youth across America to disrespect our flag. In essence, Kaepernick is also dissing the men who made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our flag flying high. In 2016, Kaepernick's net worth was $22 million. Kaepernick signed a football contract for $126 million. After declining performances and them dissing our national anthem, Kaepernick was let go only receiving $39.4 million of their contract. http://read.bi/2xniq6h Oh how racist white America has screwed this poor black man. I am being sarcastic, folks. I could call Kaepernick an ungrateful spoiled brat idiot. But Kaepernick is really a tragic example of how decades of Leftists spewing hatred for our country has infected the minds of our youths. Please black conservatives, do not pander to Leftists' lies about our country in an attempt to prove your loyalty to your blackness. Only by spreading the truth will we defeat Leftists' insidious divisive evil and unite us as Americans.

Kingsglaive Final Fantasy XV release dates; out digitally Aug 30, Blu-ray Oct 4
Kingsglaive Final Fantasy XV will release in select theaters nationwide on August 19th, and will release digitally on August 30th. The Blu-ray and DVD version will release October 4th. The movie will also be included with the Deluxe and Ultimate Collectors' Edition of Final Fantasy XV — out on September 30th.
This comes to us from a Kingsglaive panel held at this year's San Diego Comic Con. Taking place alongside the events the game, the film follows Nyx Ulric, one of the guardians of the crown known as the Kingsglaive as they battle to protect the city of Insomnia from the Niflheim forces.
Update: Here's a current list of theaters in the US where Kingsglaive Final Fantasy XV will play:
Kim Jong-nam arrives at Beijing International Airport in 2007. Credit:Getty Images They were known to have spent most of their time outside North Korea and had spoken out publicly against their family's dynastic control of the isolated state. Malaysian police official Fadzil Ahmat told Malaysian state news agency Bernama that the deceased had been approached from behind. "A woman came from behind and covered their face with a cloth laced with a liquid," they said. "The deceased ... felt like someone grabbed or held their face from behind," Mr Fadzil said. "He felt dizzy, so they asked for help at the... counter of KLIA (airport)."

Credit:AAP Mr Fadzil said Kim Jong-nam had been planning to travel from Kuala Lumpur to Macau, where they had been living under Chinese protection and was quoted in 2012 as saying North Korea needed "Chinese-style economic reform". "I have conveyed the matter to the North Korean embassy," Mr Fadzil said, adding that an autopsy was planned to seek the cause of death. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un pictured in Pyongyang in 2016.

Police are also investigating Mr Kim's movements in Malaysia after they arrived in the country on February 6 on a flight from Macau. Kim Jong-nam's father was former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. Credit:AP Police said Malaysia has received a request to send the body to North Korea but it would not be released until completion of a post-mortem, which was being undertaken on Wednesday. Malaysia is one of a dwindling number of countries that has close relations with North Korea, which is under global sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile launches. Malaysians and North Koreans can visit each other's countries without visas. The North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur has made no comment.
South Korea's acting president and prime minister Hwang Kyo-ahn described the apparent assassination as a "brutal and inhumane" example of the nature of Kim Jong-un's regime. "Based on the understanding that this case is of great importance, our government is keeping close tabs on North Korea's movements," Mr Hwang said during a special session of their country's national security council on Wednesday. They reiterated a call for strengthened sanctions and pressure to force North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions. In October 2012, South Korean prosecutors said a North Korean man detained as a spy had admitted involvement in a plot to stage a hit-run accident targeting Kim Jong-nam in China in 2010. South Korean media outlets reported Kim's death in Kuala Lumpur was the result of a planned attack by North Korean spies, with some South Korean outlets originally claiming it had been carried out using "poison needles".
One of the outlets, Chosun, citing multiple local sources, claimed two women believed to be North Korean intelligence agents fled the airport in a taxi. "I think the two were female spies dispatched by North Korea," said an intelligence official, quoted by the Korea Joongang Daily. A South Korean government source confirmed the death to Reuters. There was no immediate comment from North Korea. In a statement, Malaysian police said the dead man held a passport under the name Kim Chol, born in Pyongyang on June 10, 1970. Kim Jong-nam is believed to have been born on May 10, 1971.
But Ken Gause, an American expert on North Korea, said Kim had previously travelled under the name Kim Chol. Mark Tokola, vice-president of the Korea Economic Institute in Washington and a former diplomat in South Korea, said it would be surprising if Kim Jong-nam was not killed on the orders of their half-brother, given that North Korean agents have reportedly tried to assassinate them in the past. "It seems probable that the motivation for the murder was a continuing sense of paranoia on the part of Kim Jong-un," they said. The North Korean leader has carried out a series of purges since assuming power five years ago which the South Korean government has described as a "reign of terror". South Korea's national news agency Yonhap quoted a source saying agents of the North's spy agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, carried out the assassination by taking advantage of a security loophole between Kim's bodyguards and Malaysian police at the airport.
South Korea's foreign ministry said it could not confirm the reports on Chosun regarding the two female spies, and the country's intelligence agency could not immediately be reached for comment. A US government source told Reuters it believed North Korea agents were responsible but did not provide evidence for that conclusion, and also said it was possible that Kim had been poisoned. Kim Jong-nam was for many years considered the heir apparent to their father but is believed to have fallen out of favour in 2001 after they were caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport, saying they had wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. The Joongang Daily quoted an intelligence official as saying Kim had been in a relationship with a woman in Malaysia and travelled there often. In 2013 Kim Jong-un's uncle Jang Song-thaek, once considered the country's second most powerful man, was executed and key figures linked to them purged. Kim Jong-nam had reportedly been close to their uncle.
In 2008 Kim Jong-nam reportedly suffered a stroke after which they travelled frequently to countries in South-east Asia and the Chinese territory of Macau. In 2012 they were reportedly having financial troubles and was evicted from a Macau hotel over a $US15,000 debt. Their mother is the late Kim Jong-il's second wife, Song Hye-rim, a South Korean-born actor and one of at least three women with whom the former leader had children. The death became public late on Tuesday as the United Nations Security Council condemned Kim Jong-un for their country's firing of a ballistic missile on Sunday, the first direct challenge to the international community since US President Donald Trump took office on January 20. North Korea's media rejected the criticism on Tuesday, saying launching the missile with a range of 2000 kilometres was a "self-defence measure".
Loading Mr Trump, who was in the US with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the time of the launch, said, "I just want everybody to understand and fully know that the United States of America stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100 per cent." with agencies
BREWSTER — They are hungry, hairy, and covered in warts. They hang from the trees like joke-shop moustaches, drop onto picnic tables and infiltrate tents and open shirt collars. Walk into the woods these days and the sound of raindrops hitting a tarp turns out to be their little black droppings showering the forest floor.
A biblical outbreak of voracious, finger-long gypsy moth caterpillars, the biggest in more than three decades, is devouring trees across Massachusetts this month, stripping bare more than 100,000 acres from the Quabbin Reservoir to Cape Cod and testing the mettle of even the most intrepid camper.
“It's just a gypsy moth bloodbath out here,” said Jeff Kilburn, as they patrolled their family's campsite in Nickerson State Park, where hundreds of the bristly menaces were merrily chewing through the oak, cherry, and pines overhead — leaving swaths of trees leafless.

They were wearing a safari hat for protection from the droppings and had stretched a blue plastic sheet over their picnic table to shield their coffee and cereal.

“It's like all-out war,” Kilburn said, as they warily eyed the wooly barbarians crawling around him. “They have invaded and they are taking no prisoners.”
Massachusetts is in the midst of the worst plague of gypsy moth caterpillars since 1981, said Joseph Elkinton, an entomologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. That year, widely regarded as the annus horribilis for the red-and-brown larvae, the insatiable beasts used their powerful jaws to cut a swath of destruction across more than 200,000 acres of Massachusetts hardwood and millions more nationwide.
The state sprayed pesticides that year to control the larvae. Eight years later, in 1989, nature came to the rescue when a naturally occurring fungal pathogen that kills gypsy moth caterpillars began appearing in New England, significantly reducing the population, Elkinton said.
Entomologists believed the caterpillar outbreaks — which had hit the state every decade or so since the 1860s, when the moths were first brought to the United States from France — were a thing of the past.

But a severe drought last May and drier-than-normal conditions earlier this month prevented the spread of the fungal pathogen, which thrives in wet weather. Suddenly, the caterpillars were back with a vengeance, denuding forests across much of the state and parts of Connecticut and Rhode Island.
“It's everywhere,” Elkinton said. “You can hear the frass falling,” they added, using the scientific term for caterpillar droppings. “And you can hear the chewing; it's quite a dramatic phenomenon.”
Ken Gooch, director of the forest health program at the state Department of Conservation and Recreation, said the caterpillars pose a serious threat to forests because they completely strip trees, making them vulnerable to other pests and disease. Last year, they said, the state spent $110,000 to remove 870 oaks from Nickerson State Park that had been killed by a two-pronged assault by gypsy moth larvae and cynipid Gall wasps.
“So this will be the second really bad year,” Gooch said, as they surveyed hundreds of the caterpillars mercilessly feasting on the leaves of a black oak in the park. “A healthy tree can tolerate multiple stressors, but when you get repeated defoliation,'' trees die.
The caterpillars have also caused some mild panic in rural communities. Gooch said they recently got a call from an elderly woman in Sturbridge whose house was covered in caterpillar droppings.
A YouTube user uploaded a video of the sounds made by the caterpillars:

“She called me up, and they were crying,” Gooch said. “She said, ‘I'm slipping as soon I go out my door. I could break a leg.'” They told them to hose off the front walkway and sidewalk.
They said a distraught teacher in Southeastern Massachusetts also called them after several children in their class got rashes from touching the spiny hairs of the caterpillars, which had fallen from trees into the playground.
They said the teacher wanted to know why the state hadn't done anything to control the caterpillar population. But Gooch said there is little the state can do.
Aerial spraying, they said, is costly and raises ecological concerns because it can kill other kinds of moths and butterflies, not just the dreaded gypsy caterpillar. Elkinton agreed, saying it was not “environmentally desirable” to use pesticides to battle caterpillars on a regional scale, as was customary in past decades.
“There is really not much that can be done, not now,” Elkinton said. “We don't have any magic bullets.”
Fortunately, they said, the caterpillars' rapacious feeding season is almost over. In the coming weeks, the larvae will metamorphosize into hard-shelled pupae and then transform again into mottled brown moths, best known for alighting on screen doors and futilely attacking porch lights.
In the meantime, campers and outdoor enthusiasts must simply tolerate the creatures.
John Kerr, who was camping at Nickerson with their girlfriend, Mary Lafond, said they see the caterpillars everywhere and their droppings are “the only sound you hear” at night.
“They're rough this year,” Kerr said as they shared sandwiches with Lafond at a picnic table by their pop-up camper. Still, they said with a shrug, “It's not going to ruin my trip. A couple of moths ain't gonna bother me.”

TAMPA -- The next time Republicans are searching for a presidential candidate, rest assured: Condoleezza Rice will be a part of that conversation.
Rice's speech Wednesday night at the Republican National Convention was easily the best-reviewed of the week so far and, at times, even seemed to out-hype vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan's keynote remarks.
The former secretary of state used their time on stage to deliver a speech that was at times wonky, at times red meat for the base, and at times personal reflection. It was good without being gimmicky -- a trap other GOP speakers seemed to fall into.
Through it all, the audience was rapt.
And really, it's not all that surprising. Rice's popularity in the GOP seems to transcend whatever reservations exist about George W. Bush's tenure in the White House and their close ties to it. And by delivering a rousing speech Wednesday, they created a new version of Condi that could put some distance between them and that resume.
Towards the end of their speech, Rice even alluded to the idea that they could be president.
"And on a personal note: A little girl grows up in Jim Crow Birmingham – the most segregated big city in America," they said. "Her parents can't take them to a movie theater or a restaurant, but they make them believe that even though they can't have a hamburger at the Woolworth's lunch counter, they can be President of the United States. And they become the Secretary of State."
This wasn't thrown into Rice's speech on a whim; these speeches are meticulously combed for their content. And while it could be dismissed as Republicans again seeking to play up the electoral achievements of black and Hispanic members of the party, this seemed to take it a step further.
In other words, it's clear that Rice -- and Republican officials -- are happy to have their name bandied about in the context of future presidential elections.
The question from here is whether they actually want to be president -- or serve in some other elected position (senator from California, perhaps?).
Rice has made a significant effort to stay in the political game in recent months, and there is clearly a place for them there. A recent Fox News poll in advance of Ryan's selection as vice president showed that Rice was the No. 1 choice for the job, with 30 percent of Republicans picking her, well ahead of Ryan and even Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).
Much of that could be attributed to the fact that they had higher name ID than the likes of Ryan and Rubio, but it shouldn't be discounted as a reflection of enthusiasm for their role in the party.
As we've written several times, there were plenty of reasons they aren't the V.P. pick this time -- not least the fact that they have expressed some pro-abortion rights tendencies and may or may not have voted for President Obama in 2008. Oh, and there's also the matter of them having served as a close adviser to Bush, who Republicans would still like to pretend doesn't exist. Rice was deeply involved in the Bush administration's foreign policy, which even many Republicans now balk at.
But time heals wounds, and parties (and politicians) evolve. The fact is, if Rice wants to run in 2016 or 2020, abortion may not be as huge a hurdle as it once was. And by that time, Rice will only be in their low-to-mid-60s, and Bush and Obama could be a relatively distant memory.
One thing's for sure: the Republican base already liked Rice a lot even before Wednesday night. And on Thursday, they are going to like them even more.
The speech they gave is the kind that keeps politicians in the national dialogue for years to come. It wasn't on the same level as President Obama's 2004 Democratic convention keynote -- which effectively stamped their ticket for the 2008 race -- but it's along the same lines.
Rice has said she's not interested in running for elective office, but things can change, and the will of the masses can be pretty compelling, if in fact a movement materializes in advance of 2016 or 2020.
From there, the question is whether they have the desire to jump into that arena -- an arena, we should note, that is looking very receptive to them
Mormonism makes a comeback: As we noted late Wednesday, Mormonism has really fallen off the radar of most Americans, despite Romney's nomination for president.
That's about to change.
Paul Ryan and Mike Huckabee addressed Romney's religion in their speeches Wednesday night, urging evangelicals to vote for Christian values rather than for the one man in the race -- Obama -- who is an evangelical. And Thursday, Mormonism is expected to be a significant part of Romney's speech and the night's overall message.
Huckabee, perhaps the preeminent evanglical voice in the GOP right now, offered this: "Of the four people on the two tickets, the only self-professed evangelical is Barack Obama, and they support changing the definition of marriage, believes that human life is disposable and expendable at any time in the womb or even beyond the womb, and tells people of faith that they must bow their knees to the God of government and violate their faith and conscience in order to comply with what they call health care. ... I care far less as to where Mitt Romney takes their family to church than I do about where they take this country."
Ryan added: "Mitt and I also go to different churches, but in any church, the best kind of preaching is done by example."
This is a tough issue for Romney to talk about, given the reservations of some in the evangelical community -- and outside it -- toward the Mormon religion.
Expect this to be a major subplot tonight.
Fixbits:
Gallup shows Ryan's favorable rating at 38 percent, with their unfavorable rating at 36 percent.
Obama suggests a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United Supreme Court case.
Obama accuses Romney's campaign of saying it won't let the truth get in the way of its campaign. But Obama also seems to attribute a quote to a Romney adviser that the adviser didn't utter.
A stray gun got left on Romney's plane, but they don't appear to have been in any danger.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) says they will campaign for Romney, even as their dad, Ron Paul, declines to fully endorse him. Also, Rand Paul only mentioned Romney once in their speech Wednesday.
Sarah Palin says Fox News canceled their interviews on Wednesday night, and they took to Facebook to vent.
House Speaker John Boehner says they "was a mess" during Ann Romney's speech
The Democratic National Convention next week will include one night focused on national security.
Missouri GOP Senate candidate Rep. Todd Akin will soon return to the campaign trail.

WASHINGTON — Tanner Roark will start Game 2 for the Washington Nationals in their NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Saturday, filling a spot that very likely would have gone to Stephen Strasburg if they were healthy.
Strasburg, though, is out for the NLDS after hurting their pitching elbow late in the regular season. On Friday, they had their first bullpen session off a mound since being sidelined exactly a month earlier, and the Nationals are hoping the right-hander could be available later in the post-season if they advance.
"He's following our return-to-throw program and he's on schedule with that, so that's good," general manager Mike Rizzo said. "We'll see how they feel tomorrow and take it from there. We'll literally go day by day."
For the right-handed Roark (16-10, 2.83 ERA), the assignment announced Friday represents the latest sign of an impressive return to starting in 2016 after being relegated to the bullpen last season despite winning 15 games as a member of Washington's 2014 rotation. Lefty Rich Hill (3-2, 1.84 ERA in six starts for LA after a trade from Oakland) will pitch Game 2 for the Dodgers.
"Emotions already are pretty high right now. … If you're not nervous, you're not human and you don't care, I feel like," said Roark, who was told Thursday they would pitch in Game 2. "So for me, being nervous is a good thing."
Hill was with the Nationals in spring training last season, then pitched at their Triple-A Syracuse affiliate before they parted ways. They wound up pitching for an independent team before working their way all the way back to the majors.
"Would have liked to have seen it work out here, sure, no doubt," said Hill, who played for current Nationals manager Dusty Baker when both were with the Chicago Cubs a decade ago.
The choice of Roark was not all that surprising, and Baker smiled broadly as they joked to media members before Game 1 on Friday: "Well, you know, we weren't debating that much. We were just kind of messing with you guys, to tell you the truth."
Second baseman Daniel Murphy was listed in the lineup, hitting cleanup, their first start since Sept. 17 after missing time because of a strained glute muscle. In a tweak to the batting order in front of Murphy, Baker flipped Bryce Harper and Jayson Werth, moving up 2015 NL MVP Harper from No. 3 to No. 2, and shifting Werth from No. 2 to No. 3.
"I just talked to them out of respect," Baker said, "but they said, ‘Hey, Skip, whatever you want to do, and whatever you think that's best, that's what you do."'
Both teams officially released their 25-man NLDS rosters, and Washington's includes only seven relievers, including three lefties. Baker said they wanted extra position players on the bench because of the possible need for pinch runners, particularly for Murphy.
Reynaldo Lopez is the only long reliever in the bullpen, while Sammy Solis, Oliver Perez and Marc Rzepczynski are the lefties; Sean Burnett is the odd man out.
Infielder Wilmer Difo and outfielder Michael A. Taylor made the roster, while relievers Burnett, Matt Belisle and Yusmeiro Petit and outfielders Ben Revere and Brian Goodwin were left off.
"We contemplated many, many different scenarios," Baker said.
The Dodgers' roster was as promised, with three catchers: Carlos Ruiz, Yasmani Grandal and Austin Barnes, who can also play in the infield. LA also has only seven relievers.
The Game 3 starting pitchers are lefty Gio Gonzalez for Washington, and righty Kenta Maeda for Los Angeles.
COLUMBUS, OHIO – The Columbus Blue Jackets announced today that longtime broadcaster Bill Davidge was recently diagnosed with multiple myeloma and has begun treatment for the disease. Davidge, who joined the Blue Jackets in 1999 as a scout and has been a member of the club's television and radio broadcast teams since the inaugural 2000-01 season, issued the following statement:

Linden Lab finally published its figures for Q1 2011 today, or at least those which we get to see. There are some notable absences. Why the figures have been so delayed is a mystery, considering that there is very little text accompanying the charts this time around.
Restructuring seems to have had a positive effect on Linden Lab's bottom line. As I surmised from its hiring patterns, the Lab is profitable, indeed the Lab is calling Q1 its most successful quarter to-date.
Now let's take a look at what's happening, based on what we can see.
Now, the first chart presented is a shameful cheat indeed. The chart shows a huge surge in completed user registrations (AKA signups). This surge starts on 11 April, which is the second quarter and has no place in this report. It's right at the top, though, and serves as a distraction, colouring the interpretation of the remainder of the data.
I'm sure that it will look great in the Q2 metrics, but for Q1? Signup rates were unremarkable, and showed a slight decline through the quarter.
Here's what the chart looks like with only Q1 figures included:
Pretty much flat with a slight decline. Still, the results themselves aren't entirely shabby. Even by the end of the quarter we're still looking at a figure roughly in excess of 10,000 completed signups per day.
Average monthly repeat logins declined slightly from Q4, falling 1.25% in Q1, while user-hours fell nearly 1% (about one million user-hours for the quarter, or eleven thousand fewer user hours each day).
These declines aren't huge in percentage terms, but are certainly reflected in the declining user-concurrency through the quarter.
World size also declined, being the second quarter that has done so, dipping by twenty square kilometres, a reduction of about 1%.
On a brighter note, the Second Life economy appears to be healthy with steady (and improving) exchange-rates coupled to an increase in money-supply and trading activity.
The exchange rate rose from 1:258.8 to 1:253.2 (an increase of 5.6 or 2.21%) – which on its own is not necessarily a great indicator. However, coupled with a 3.5% (one million US Dollars) increase in the money supply, and 3.25% increase in Lindex trading volumes (another one million US Dollars), I can only conclude that we're seeing a reversal of the slight decline in the Second Life economy that we've been seeing in previous quarters.
If you wanted to see how the Second Life Marketplace was performing for Q1, you're out of luck. Those figures have apparently been dropped from the quarterly reports. The trend prior to that looked like it was heading for a plateau, or perhaps it peaked in Q4 and declined. It's hard to say at this time, but it is certainly tempting to draw conclusions from the cutting of that metric.
I'm particularly looking forward to the figures for Q2. I actually have a good feeling about next quarter's figures, for the first time in a very long time.

The mind projection fallacy is an informal fallacy first described by physicist and Bayesian philosopher E.T. Jaynes. It occurs when someone thinks that the way they see the world reflects the way the world really is, going as far as assuming the real existence of imagined objects.[1] That is, someone's subjective judgments are "projected" to be inherent properties of an object, rather than being related to personal perception. One consequence is that others may be assumed to share the same perception, or that they are irrational or misinformed if they do not.
A second form of the fallacy, as described by Jaynes,[1] occurs when someone assumes that their own lack of knowledge about a phenomenon (a fact about their state of mind) means that the phenomenon is not or cannot be understood (a fact about reality). (See also Map and territory.)
Jaynes used this concept to argue against Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.[2] They described the fallacy as follows:[1]
[I]n studying probability theory, it was vaguely troubling to see reference to "gaussian random variables", or "stochastic processes", or "stationary time series", or "disorder", as if the property of being gaussian, random, stochastic, stationary, or disorderly is a real property, like the property of possessing mass or length, existing in Nature. Indeed, some seek to develop statistical tests to determine the presence of these properties in their data...
Once one has grasped the idea, one sees the Mind Projection Fallacy everywhere; what we have been taught as deep wisdom, is stripped of its pretensions and seen to be instead a foolish non sequitur. The error occurs in two complementary forms, which we might indicate thus: (A) (My own imagination) → (Real property of Nature), [or] (B) (My own ignorance) → (Nature is indeterminate)

The man behind Uber's radical redesign of the brand has left the firm.
Earlier this week the firm unveiled a radical new look, replacing the familiar U with colourful geometric shapes, which are unique for each market and if you are a drive or a rider.
However, the logo caused uproar online, with users deriding it as a 'wrong turn' for the car firm.

If you had trouble locating your Uber app sometime today, it's because they released a new logo. Users will now see colourful geometric shapes, which unique for each market and if you are a drive or a rider. This new move is to reflect 'what Uber actually is -- a transportation network'
Now, the man behind it has revealed they have left the company.
In a Medium post, published just 24 hours after Uber's branding unveil, Andrew Crow explained that they are 'using our recent successes as a chance to take time off to rest, reflect, and recharge. '
'Today, I am moving on from Head of Design & Brand at Uber,' they wrote.
'I leave an amazing team who works to create great experiences, shaping the way people and things move through the world.
The new logo aims to reflect 'what Uber actually is - a transportation network', the company said.
But many have ridiculed the strange design for being nothing more than a corporate re-branding exercise.
'The old Uber was black and white, somewhat distant and cold,' Travis Kalanick, Uber's CEO and co-founder, wrote in a blog post.
'This belied what Uber actually is – a transportation network.'
The iconic 'U' is now a circle with a square in the middle set on a colourful background for riders.
If you're a driver, you will see a hexagon with a square in the center and again set on a colourful background.

All of the rebranding of the firm was done in-house and logos began as concepts instead of just icons
INSPIRATION FOR THE LOGOS During their brainstorming, the team focused on a blog post Kalanick wrote in 2013, 'Bits & Atoms', which compared Uber to bits and atoms. Bits is the firm's technology – Uber's mapping and dispatch software. And the atoms are a representation of the people. Another concept emerged in the drawing board of small square tiles, similar to the ones that line bathroom floors. The team agreed on a design and decided to use colours, patterns and images unique to each specific market. Uber says it was inspired by Mexican pink and patterns in the local tiles in Mexico. In Ireland, the Georgian architecture and lush greens will be highlighted. And in Nigeria, from the Ankara, which 'came up again and again because of its bright colours and beautiful geometric patterns'.

And of course they came quick and in a huge wave of unanimous 'No's'.
More than just a handful have made comments about the app being hard to find and that it works slower since the new update.
And many social media users said that the new look won't make Uber-users out of people who oppose its business practices.
Twitter users branded the new logo 'ugly' and expressed confusion about why they had made a change 'for changes sake'

The service was available to about 100 riders who could request BMWs and Lincoln Town Cars, which is the reason behind the sleek, luxurious 'U' logo. But now Uber understands it is no longer just catering to a few big spenders looking for a joy ride
When Uber was conceived it was designed for individuals who wanted to 'roll around San Francisco like ballers'.

AIRBNB HITS BACK AFTER ITS 'VAGINA LOGO' GETS RIDICULED Uber isn't the only one to have faced controversy over its new logo. In 2014, Airbnb was forced to defend its controversial new logo, claiming it will become as recognisable as the Nike swoosh. However, many believed it looked more like a vagina. 'It's just like: Go ahead, laugh all you want, guys,' said Airbnb co-founder and CTO Nathan Blecharczyk at a dinner in San Francisco. 'We wouldn't want to design a logo that caters to the lowest common denominator.' The logo, created by UK design firm The Design Studio, drew comparisons to various body parts now only because it didn't have the Airbnb brand attached to it yet.

However, many believed it looked more like a vagina Airbnb's CEO Brian Chesky said the logo was inspired by famous logos from around the world, like the Olympic rings and Batman symbol. 'We've created a symbol for us as a community,' they said in a blog post announcing the change. 'It's an iconic mark for our windows, our doors, and our shared values. 'It's a symbol that, like us, can belong wherever it happens to be.' Twitter user shaunpendy designed an infographic providing one possible explanation for how the logo came to be. In addition to people, places, and love, they said the final component was 'truck nuts.' User mbraaten hypothesised what the meeting to decide on the symbol might've been like. In their scenario, one person says they're all out of ideas, and another person responds, 'Balls!'
'That's where we came from, but it's not where we are today.'
Presently, Uber is available in 400 cities in 65 different countries around the world and about two-thirds of its 6,000 or so employees have been with the company less than a year.
'There is an evolution here, for the found as well as for the company,' said Kalanick, 'because really they're very connected.
When Uber was a young company, Kalanick was seen as aggressive, hostile and always looking for a 'fight' – with regulators, the taxi industry and other competitors.
Kalanick has said in previous interview that this was all misrepresented by the media.
'When you don't really know who you are', they explained, 'it's easy to be miscast—as a company, or as a person.'
Kalanick believes this 'rebrand has been an act of self-exploration'.

WITH crocodiles and deadly jellyfish in the ocean and dangerous cassowaries in the rainforest, Far North Queenslanders are used to living on the edge.
So when the monsoon rains start to pour there's only one thing for it. Wakeboarding!
Specifically, high-speed wakeboarding along flooded roadside verges while being towed.
By a ute.
With the long awaited tropical wet season finally here, Cairns-based photographer Shay Bourne headed out to find subjects to snap after heavy rainfalls this week in the wake of ex-Cyclone Oswald.
"I came across these guys wakeboarding along the side of the road," says Bourne.
The gang of mates had tied a rope to the back of their ute and were towing each other through the water.
"The sport is pretty popular up here, with a waterski park at the foot of the mountain and Lake Tinaroo at the top."
"I asked the boys if I could photograph them and they willingly obliged: they actually played up for the camera."
This uniquely Far North Queensland-style watersport is almost certainly not legal, but it sure looks like a lot of fun.

Over the weekend there was pretty big buzz coming out of Philadelphia when the Eagles signed their right tackle Lane Johnson to a huge $11.25 million per year contract extension with over $35 million in guarantees. My initial thought was the same as everyone else's: “what in the world are they thinking”. Johnson was drafted 4th overall back in 2013 and has been a bit of a disappointment. He's not a left tackle and these are the numbers for an elite left tackle. While I still don't have all the numbers on the contract I have enough information now to I think put the contract in a context that we can all understand better and see why the Eagles signed the contract when they did and for this huge figure.
Left tackle had generally been a stagnant position salary wise until this past year when Washington signed Trent Williams to an extension worth $13.2 million per year. Williams is a terrific player though I'm not sure anyone considered them best in the NFL. One contract that seems high can usually be thrown out but this was a clear market mover. Within days of Williams' deal the Colts signed Anthony Castonzo to a $10.9M contract and the Patriots did a short term extension with Nate Solder for about $10 million. While Williams may have been a Pro Bowler these others were not. Solid players, sure. Former first rounders, absolutely. Top 5 or 6 in the NFL? Probably not. It was a market shift that teams needed to be aware of.
Comparing Johnson's new money cash flows to the other left tackles in the market doesn't paint a terrible picture for the Eagles but it doesn't seem great either as he'll earn significantly more than Castonzo by the end of the 3rd year of the contract.
Year Johnson Smith Castonzo Williams -1 NA $9,000,000 NA NA 0 $10,000,000 $10,000,000 $10,562,000 $3,250,000 1 $18,000,000 $20,000,000 $17,562,000 $20,250,000 2 $28,250,000 $30,000,000 $27,562,000 $31,750,000 3 $39,100,000 $40,000,000 $35,562,000 $42,000,000 4 $47,935,000 $50,000,000 $43,812,000 $53,250,000 5 $56,250,000 $60,000,000 FA $66,000,000
But from the team perspective this really is not the fair way to look at the contract. The Eagles made an interesting decision regarding the time that they entered into this negotiation with Johnson. Johnson was eligible this offseason to have their fifth year option picked up by the team for 2017. Generally teams pick up the option and then enter negotiations. That is exactly what happened with Smith and Castonzo.
For the Eagles though strategically it did not make sense to make that move. Johnson's status is probably similar to that of Matt Kalil of the Vikings who had an $11.1 million option picked up for the 2016 season despite the fact that most people seemed to agree Kalil was not an $11 million player. But Kalil, like Johnson, falls into that donut hole area where they play an important position and you will kick yourself if they develop into a better player down the line and you let them leave over a few million at the backend of their rookie contract.
When we truly value the Johnson contract we need to include that team option in the analysis because it was very clear the team was going to pick it up. Even if they didn't do it on paper We can estimate that the team option would likely have cost the Eagles $11.7 million guaranteed. In addition Johnson had $3.1 million already guaranteed in 2016 salary. Like Smith, Johnson is really being signed two years out from free agency.
Now the numbers paint a very different picture.
Year Johnson Smith Castonzo Williams -1 $10,000,000 $9,000,000 NA NA 0 $6,300,000 $10,000,000 $10,562,000 $3,250,000 1 $16,550,000 $20,000,000 $17,562,000 $20,250,000 2 $27,400,000 $30,000,000 $27,562,000 $31,750,000 3 $36,235,000 $40,000,000 $35,562,000 $42,000,000 4 $44,550,000 $50,000,000 $43,812,000 $53,250,000
Their four year contract will pay them less new money that Smith or Castonzo by the end of the original effective term of their contract. They also lag Castonzo over the first two years and won't pass them until year 3. That's pretty good for the Eagles, assuming of course Johnson is a left tackle.
Essentially what the Eagles did was take a $6.3 million risk that Johnson can be a left tackle, a transition that seems clear will occur either this year or next as the replacement for Jason Peters. Knowing that once that switch was made the Eagles would be forced to pay them as a left tackle anyway it made far more sense to just concede the point and get out in front of the contract rather than working from behind when more players sign extensions that push the market further.
Don't read into the guarantees on the contract either. Per a source with knowledge of the deal the full guaranteed portion of the contract is worth $20.8 million, all of which is paid by the end of 2017. The new guarantee only represents the same $6 million raise reflected above.
The savings are actually reasonable by doing a deal now. What happens if they wait until next year? Well first of all the $3 million guarantee for 2016 that is rolled into this package would instead represent new guarantees. If they run the same contract they agreed two here just starting a year later, they will save themselves about $3.7 million over the next two years and $1.5 million over 2 years. What if they just didn't sign them and had to go the franchise tag route? The overall payout is about the same (this is technically what the deal probably best represents) but the cap structure is far worse.
In general as long as Johnson becomes an adequate left tackle by next season the Eagles will come out ahead on the contract. The only disaster scenario is if they never develops beyond the right side. The Eagles will have leverage to bring the dollar figures down in 2018 but they would have to get them to slash about $6 million in both 2018 and 2019 salary to bring the effective totals down to the Bryan Bulaga market. That might be a hard sell to drop that far down.
Did former US EPA man influence EFSA verdict on glyphosate?
EFSA fails to provide evidence to support its decision to dismiss a key study showing glyphosate is carcinogenic
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has been accused of excluding from its glyphosate assessment a key study only because of a negative comment by a former US Environment Protection Agency (EPA) official.
The former US EPA official, Jess Rowland, is under investigation in a US court case brought by cancer sufferers, who believe that exposure to Roundup triggered their disease. Based on internal Monsanto documents disclosed in the lawsuit, Rowland is accused of colluding with Monsanto to defend glyphosate's health record.
The accusation against EFSA was made by the toxicologist Dr Peter Clausing, representing Pesticide Action Network (PAN) Germany, at a scientific conference on glyphosate's health risks, held in the EU Parliament on 10 May. The conference was hosted by the Czech Socialist MEP Pavel Poc.
Dr Clausing said that they had met the head of EFSA's pesticides unit, Jose Tarazona, the previous week. They had discussed a key study (Kumar 2001) showing that glyphosate caused malignant lymphoma in mice. Dr Clausing said that Dr Tarazona was not able able to give any concrete reasons why the study was excluded from EFSA's assessment, other than that a US EPA observer had said the US EPA had not accepted it due to viral infections in the animals.
According to a report in EU Food Policy,[1] EFSA and PAN agree that the US EPA observer was Jess Rowland, who made the remark about infections during a teleconference about glyphosate organised by EFSA in 2015.
However, EFSA told EU Food Policy that “it and member states had already picked up on weaknesses with the study and that the majority of member states had agreed there was a high background of malignant lymphomas in the mice used for the study.”
The EU Food Policy article goes on to quote Dr Tarazona as saying that Rowland informed EFSA "about potential flaws in the Kumar study (2001) related to viral infections that could influence survival as well as tumour incidence".
Dr Tarazona told EU Food Policy that EFSA didn't just take Rowland's word for it: "After the teleconference, EFSA experts checked the Kumar (2001) study themselves and found additional indications that confirmed deficiencies in the health status of animals, which supported the plausibility of a viral infection."
Dr Tarazona told EU Food Policy that Dr Clausing's remarks "give rise to concerns about the integrity of EFSA's glyphosate assessment", but that this is "not borne out by the facts".
No evidence for alleged “viral infections”
So what were these “additional indications that confirmed deficiencies in the health status of animals, which supported the plausibility of a viral infection”?
EFSA has had plenty of chances to describe them.
First, in its “Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance glyphosate”, published in 2015, EFSA declared the Kumar study as “not acceptable due to viral infections that could influence survival as well as tumour incidence – especially lymphomas”.
And second, in a peer-reviewed paper of the same year explaining why EFSA had come to a different conclusion on glyphosate's carcinogenicity from the World Health Organisation's cancer agency IARC (which classed it as a probable carcinogen), Dr Tarazona and their co-authors from EFSA and Germany's Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) say that the Kumar study “was excluded due to a likely viral infection in the experimental population”.
But in neither document does EFSA give any supporting evidence for viral infections.
And in neither document does EFSA describe any “additional indications that confirmed deficiencies in the health status of animals, which supported the plausibility of a viral infection”, such as Tarazona claimed were present in the Kumar study.
In fact there is an irrefutable (by the EU authorities, at least) source that states that there is no evidence whatsoever that the animals in this experiment suffered from a viral infection or that their health was deficient as a result of such an infection. That source is none other than the CLH (harmonised classification and labelling) report on glyphosate, based on industry data and submitted by the German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BAuA) to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).
The CLH report states: “During a teleconference (TC 117) on carcinogenicity of glyphosate hold [sic.] by EFSA… it was mentioned by an US EPA observer that the Kumar (2001, ASB2012-11491) study had been excluded from US EPA evaluation due to the occurrence of viral infection that could influence survival as well as tumour incidences, especially those of lymphomas. However, in the study report itself, there was no evidence of health deterioration due to suspected viral infection and, thus, the actual basis of EPA's decision is not known” (p. 72).
Nevertheless, ECHA continued to use the narrative of a virus infection in spite of its admission that there was no evidence for such an infection. In its Opinion, ECHA cautions against “a possible role of oncogenic viruses” – which it apparently deemed as sufficient reason to exclude this important study from the overall assessment.
Unsurprisingly, having disposed of Kumar using an apparently evidence-free argument, ECHA followed EFSA in concluding that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.
Dr Tarazona's identification of the “US EPA observer” as Jess Rowland raises questions about the influence on the EFSA glyphosate assessment exercised by this man – who allegedly boasted to a Monsanto executive that they deserved a medal if they could kill another agency's investigation into the chemical's health risks.
“Viral infection” claim first shows up in Monsanto-supported paper
It seems that Rowland themselves did not come up with the narrative of the “viral infection”. It first appeared in a Monsanto- and Glyphosate Task Force-supported review, which concluded that glyphosate was non-carcinogenic. The review was co-authored by Monsanto employee David Saltmiras and published in the journal Critical Reviews in Toxicology, which has industry ties. However, even this review introduces the idea of a viral infection in tentative language, referring to a “possible viral infection” that “may have confounded interpretation of results”.
EFSA goes much further than this Monsanto-linked paper in its unqualified claim that the Kumar study was “not acceptable due to viral infections”.
Malignant lymphoma-prone mice?
But what about the other supposed weakness in the Kumar study, the “high background of malignant lymphomas in the mice used for the study” that EFSA mentioned to EU Food Policy?
That argument doesn't stand up either, according to Dr Clausing. They told GMWatch that while a good number of control mice did get malignant lymphomas, the glyphosate-treated mice had a statistically significant increase in malignant lymphomas, in a clearly dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, this statistically significant increase in malignant lymphoma was well above the range of historical control data (the “background” incidence referred to by EFSA) – supporting the observation of a glyphosate-induced carcinogenicity.
Dr Clausing said that these were valid historical control data as measured by OECD standards. This was important because there are a number of examples where EFSA used invalid historical control data to dismiss significant findings of carcinogenicity.
GMWatch believes that for EFSA to claim that these increases were due to chance and not to glyphosate is to turn its back on the scientific method.
The study that had to be killed
Dr Clausing believes that the Kumar study, together with two other studies showing the same effect, presents difficult-to-refute evidence of glyphosate's carcinogenicity. Its particular significance within EFSA's assessment is that the reasons used by EFSA to dismiss other studies showing glyphosate is carcinogenic do not apply to the Kumar study and a second study by Wood et al. (2009). In both studies the increase in malignant lymphoma in glyphosate-treated animals was both dose-dependent and significant, at doses that could not be dismissed as only a “high-dose phenomenon”.
In reality the Kumar study is far from being an outlier. Before EFSA produced its assessment, the German authority BfR, under pressure from the IARC verdict, had demonstrated statistically significant increases in cancer in seven rodent carcinogenicity studies with glyphosate. But EFSA denied these results, using what Dr Clausing considers spurious arguments, and insisted that there was only one mouse study – Kumar – with statistical significance.
According to the European legislation, evidence for carcinogenicity in at least two separate studies is “sufficient evidence” to label a compound as carcinogenic (category 1B). That would mean an automatic ban. Thus in Dr Clausing's view, the Kumar study “presented an obstacle” to EFSA's apparent intention to declare glyphosate as non-carcinogenic: “That's why the exclusion of this particular study from further consideration was so important.”
Dr Clausing is not the only authority to believe that the Kumar study was particularly problematic for those who wish to argue that glyphosate is non-carcinogenic. The BfR remarked in its assessment of glyphosate that this unpublished industry study “was apparently not available to IARC” – “otherwise, it would have been certainly used as the first place argument for carcinogenicity of glyphosate” (p. 9).
Flawed study included by EFSA
Dr Clausing argued in their presentation to the EU Parliament that the Kumar 2001 study should have been included by EFSA in its assessment and that a study by Atkinson (1993), which found no carcinogenic effect of glyphosate, should have been excluded. The latter study was invalid, they explained, because only animals with signs of malignant lymphoma that were visible to the naked eye were examined more closely – a recipe for missing numerous cases. This flawed study was used as additional “proof” that glyphosate did not cause malignant lymphoma.
If EFSA had included Kumar and excluded Atkinson, it would not have concluded that glyphosate was not carcinogenic, Dr Clausing told the meeting.
Did Rowlands mislead EFSA on glyphosate?
In light of Jess Rowland's role in the assessment of carcinogenicity of glyphosate in the US as reflected by the internal Monsanto documents, there are serious concerns that they might have influenced the decision by providing wrong information. Yet EFSA is not an innocent victim in this case. It apparently failed to properly scrutinize Rowland's claim.
To summarize, the only publicly available explanation for EFSA's dismissal of the Kumar study due to a viral infection is Rowland's claim – yet there is no factual evidence whatsoever to back up the claim. Dr Clausing said they have examined the publicly available documents as well as the raw data of the Kumar study, which was made available to them by EFSA. They said, “Scrutinizing all these documents did not provide any other evidence than the Rowland intervention. As a result, I have doubts about the integrity of EFSA's assessment of glyphosate. Those doubts have been sown by EFSA itself.”

Comcast SportsNet New England will launch a New England Revolution postgame show following Saturday night's game against the Chicago Fire.
Production for Revs Postgame Live will be handled by Comcast. Revolution games, which are shown on the regional channel, are produced by the Revolution's ownership through Kraft Sports Productions. The two sides work together on game productions and will collaborate some with the postgame as well, according to Revolution play-by-play commentator and supervising producer Brad Feldman.
(For comparison, CSNNE also carries Celtics games and handles production for pregame, postgame, and the games themselves.)
The postgame show will run between the end of the game and be off the air at the top of the hour. In most cases, that will probably mean about a half-hour production. CSNNE's schedule has blocked out between 9:30 and 10 p.m. for the show this Saturday.

CSNNE began broadcasting all Revolution games in 2010. Prior to that, the games had been split between Channel 38, and CSNNE and its predecessor, Fox Sports Net New England. The station has increased its Revolution-related content this year by making its bi-annual “State of the Revs'' show bi-weekly, and by using Revolution players and officials for analysis throughout the 2014 World Cup.
Between 2008 and 2012, the Revolution held an online-only postgame show produced by Kraft Media. In June, the Revolution announced a postgame radio show on 1510 AM Yahoo! Sports. Revolution games are broadcast on the radio on 98.5 The Sports Hub.
Major League Soccer recently netted an eight-year, $720 million television deal for its national broadcast rights from ESPN, FOX, and Univision. That and other signs of MLS growth may have prompted Comcast launch its own postgame. CSNNE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The postgame show will be hosted by CSNNE anchor Dalen Cuff and former Women's World Cup winner Kristine Lilly. Feldman and their broadcast partner Paul Mariner will add postgame analysis.
Rev fans tuning in to Saturday's debut program will probably hope for happier news than they've had lately. After a strong start to the season that saw the team in first place in the Eastern Conference, New England has dropped four straight MLS games, as well as its most recent game in the US Open Cup, an outside-the-league tournament.

Saturday's show will mark the first of seven planned episodes this season. Not every game will get the postgame treatment, with one more episode scheduled in July, one in August, and two in September and October each. All seven episodes will air after home games with 7:30 start times.
The postgame schedule for the rest of the season:
July 12 vs. Chicago
July 30 vs. Colorado
Aug. 23 vs. Chivas USA
Sept. 3 vs. Kansas City
Sept. 13 vs. Montreal
Oct. 4 vs. Columbus
Oct. 25 vs. Toronto
Time Frame 2020-2022? Rumor Status Confirmed
Specific Details A Star Wars themed resort is coming to Walt Disney World. The luxury resort will allow guests to be fully immersed in a multi-day storyline at both the resort and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge inside Disney's Hollywood Studios. It is expected that droids and creatures will interact with guests at the resort and every window will look out into space. Guests will stay in one of 100 rooms aboard a facility themed like a spaceship. In February 2018, the Disney Parks Blog shared two short teaser/concept videos for the Star Wars resort. The article reports that the experience would be an all-inclusive, 2-night stay set inside the Star Wars universe. This could be a call to Trowbridge's suggestion that actions in the land would have consequences elsewhere in the land and those guests staying at the boutique resort may be the recipients of that level of immersion. Resort guests would be further integrated into the story, potentially have missions and interactions with Star Wars characters and performers at their level of comfort. The article suggests that the interactivity may include flight training, ship exploration, lightsaber training and secret missions on both the Starship resort and the Star Wars land. Accommodations are also expected to include all meals during the two days, featured entertainment that would include dinner shows, park admission and other hotel amenities that may include an on-board cantina and robotic droid butlers. The article suggests a per-person cost of $900-$1000. The resort will be south of Disney's Hollywood Studios, adjacent to the Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge area of the park allowing for a seemless transition. The hotel is expected to utilize the World Drive entrance. Blueprints reveal the layout of the resort:
Rumor Timeline
November 17, 2018: At the D23 Destination D Event, Bob Chapek (Chairman of Disney Parks, Events, Consumer Products) shared additional details and concept art for the Star Wars Resort coming to Walt Disney World.
Chapek confirmed that the hotel would put guests aboard a luxury starship with high-end dining and "space-view" cabins.
November 15, 2018: Disney recently filed permits with the South Florida Water Management District and CaliforniaCoasterKings.com posted an article showcase details of the permit.
The permit reveals a layout of the Star Wars Hotel. The layout shows a dedicated entrance area, guest cabins, a dining area and a dedicated area for transportation to Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge. The permit also revealed that the hotel will have 100 guest rooms.
July 8, 2018: WDWMagic.com user danlb_2000 posted the following quote from the South Florida Water Management District permits for the Star Wars Permits:
"The current schedule proposes to begin construction in late 2018 and complete work in 2020."

April 18, 2017: WDWNT.com posted an article that shared concept art and details on the Star Wars boutique resort.
According to the article, Disney has been surveying guests about a Starship themed resort that would be connected to Disney's Hollywood Studios. The surveying is reportedly being conducted by a third party and may be connected to some of the teasers recently given by Imagineer Scott Trowbridge about another level of interactivity within Star Wars Land.
The article reports that the experience would be an all-inclusive, 2-night stay set inside the Star Wars universe. This could be a call to Trowbridge's suggestion that actions in the land would have consequences elsewhere in the land and those guests staying at the boutique resort may be the recipients of that level of immersion. Resort guests would be further integrated into the story, potentially have missions and interactions with Star Wars characters and performers at their level of comfort. The article suggests that the interactivity may include flight training, ship exploration, lightsaber training and secret missions on both the Starship resort and the Star Wars land.
Accommodations are also expected to include all meals during the two days, featured entertainment that would include dinner shows, park admission and other hotel amenities that may include an on-board cantina and robotic droid butlers. The article suggests a per-person cost of $900-$1000

The Trump administration appears set on a confrontation with China sooner rather than later, and the Turnbull government has given every indication that it will be riding shotgun with the US when that happens. These are dangerous times.
Even before Trump was elected, they had made clear their belief that the US needed to slap down China, which they consider a threat to US domination of the Asia-Pacific.  They are by no means the first president to take that view: Obama's so-called pivot to Asia was driven by the same assessment. But Trump is ramping up the rhetoric and dispensing with some of the diplomatic niceties.
During the Republican primaries, the billionaire blamed China for America's economic woes. They threatened to impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports. They named the country a “currency manipulator” for allegedly suppressing the value of the yuan to make its exports cheaper. They threatened to hold up China's nomination as a “market economy” at the World Trade Organization, limiting its access to the full benefits of WTO membership.
How far Trump goes on each of these issues now that they are in office remains to be seen. But since their election, the direction of US foreign policy toward China has been unmistakable. There was theirs taking a phone call from the Taiwanese president, the first US president to do so since 1979. This was followed by tweets attacking China on trade and its stance on UN sanctions against North Korea. And, most significantly, Trump threw into question the “one China” policy, the basis of US-China relations for four decades.
Trump has named a string of China hawks to senior positions. They include national security adviser Michael Flynn, National Trade Council chief Peter Navarro (author of Death by China) and Robert Lightizer, appointed to head the Office of the US Trade Representative. Steve Bannon, Trump's chief political adviser and now member of the National Security Council, is another China basher. Bannon told a caller to their talkback show in March last year: “We're going to war in the South China Sea in five to 10 years, aren't we? There's no doubt about that”.
But perhaps the most stunning confirmation of the aggressive turn by the new administration was a comment by new secretary of state Rex Tillerson. At their confirmation hearings, Tillerson threw all the diplomatic evasions out the window. On China's activities in the South China Sea, they declared: “We're going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the island building stops and, second, your access to those islands is not going to be allowed”.
All this comes in the context of Trump's plans to “rebuild” the US armed forces, including boosting the US naval deployment to the Asia-Pacific more aggressively than Obama's pivot. China for its part is rapidly expanding its military capabilities.
Australia and the US war machine
If the US and China come to blows in the South China Sea, Trump is looking to Australia and Japan, the US's two most longstanding allies in the region, as backup. This would mean drawing Australia ever closer to battle alongside the US.
Large parts of northern Australia are being prepared as a springboard for the US and Australia to fight wars in Asia. So far as the US is concerned, Australia is ideally placed for this role because it is out of reach of most Chinese missiles, sits close to some of China's major trade routes and is therefore well positioned to attack Chinese shipping, and has a huge interior that can be used for live-fire exercises.
The US is already rotating 1,250 marines through a base in Darwin every six months, and there is an increase in the frequency of US warship visits. By 2020, the number of marines in the northern capital will double. While in the Northern Territory, the marines are being trained to seize and hold enemy territory. The US is also flying B-52 bombers from the Tindal RAAF base in Katherine. Although talks last year to base long-range B-1 bombers and aerial tankers in Darwin have stalled, they are a sign of things to come.
The US also has access to the North Australian Range Complex (Bradshaw, Mt Bundey and Delamere) for live-fire exercises. On the west coast, the government is spending nearly $400 million to upgrade the Stirling naval base near Perth to turn it into a hub for visiting US warships and submarines operating in the Indian Ocean.
The Defence White Papers of 2013 and 2016 have set out substantial increases in military spending precisely to boost Australia's assistance to the US in the event of a conflict with China. While spending is being cut across other portfolios, the military is having money thrown at it, its budget rising from $32 billion in 2016-17 to $59 billion in 2025-26. A dozen new submarines, 100 new F35 fighter bombers and dozens more surface ships and surveillance aircraft will be acquired. All are designed to be “interoperable” with the US military – that is, ready to be deployed in combat alongside the US.
Future joint US-Australian military operations in Asia already feature in the biennial “Talisman Sabre” exercises, which involve 19,000 Australian and US personnel conducting land and sea exercises in Shoalwater Bay near Rockhampton. Like the base in Darwin, these exercises are designed to train military personnel to seize beachheads in enemy territory. In coming years, 14,000 military personnel from another strong US ally, Singapore, will also start annual exercises in Shoalwater Bay.
Of more military significance even than these facilities are the extensive military and intelligence cooperation shared by the two countries. Pine Gap satellite tracking station near Alice Springs and North West Cape (the Harold E. Holt Naval Communications Station) in Exmouth, Western Australia, are the jewels in the crown. These two stations allow the US and Australia to maintain 24-hour global surveillance of enemies, allies or, as Edward Snowden revealed, civilian populations at home.
As well as Pine Gap and North West Cape, the extensive intelligence sharing between members of the “Five-Eyes” partnership (the US, Australia, New Zealand, Britain and Canada) involves three ground satellite stations at Kojarena, near Geraldton, along with surveillance facilities at HMAS Harman in the ACT, the Shoal Bay Receiving Station in Darwin and the Learmouth Solar Observatory in Western Australia. The US has also been invited by Australia to establish a maritime surveillance operation facility, including an airstrip for aircraft and drones, in the Cocos Islands, 3,000 kilometres north-west of Perth.
Such is Australia's importance to US war planning that US Pacific command chief Harry Harris told a Senate committee in Washington in February last year that the US relied “heavily” on Australia for its advanced military capabilities. The US cannot launch a single ballistic missile, guide a single drone or provide signals to a single ship or submarine operating anywhere from the Arabian Gulf to California without intelligence provided by Australia. We are embedded at the heart of the US war machine, even without a single shot by the Australian army, navy or air force.
Turnbull government backs Trump
The Turnbull government is egging Trump on with their aggressive foreign policy. The prime minister and their cabinet colleagues are determined to ensure that the US stays focused on the Asia-Pacific, and they are even more anxious that it do so now that Trump has abandoned one of the linchpins of Obama's pivot – the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
On Trump's election, Turnbull told reporters that “a stronger United States means a safer world”. Foreign minister Julie Bishop has urged the US to “maintain a strong presence” in the Asia-Pacific. In the aftermath of Trump's inauguration, Turnbull emphasised the warm relationship between the two imperialist powers: “We have fought side by side with the United States in every major conflict since the First World War and the relationship is very, very engaged, it's very close, and it operates at so many levels … It's not just between two leaders, it's at every level”.
The Labor Party, loyal to the US alliance to the last, has barely said a peep. In response to Turnbull and Bishop's comments, shadow foreign minister Penny Wong simply “encouraged constructive US engagement in our region”. No-one on the shadow benches has rejected Tillerson's calls for a confrontation with China. And shadow defence minister Richard Marles has been openly demanding that the Turnbull government send the Australian navy to join highly provocative US “freedom of navigation” operations in the South China Sea.
Some former political leaders and senior defence bureaucrats, such as Paul Keating and Hugh White, are apprehensive about Trump's bellicose rhetoric towards China and are urging the Turnbull government not to follow the US into a conflict that could have potentially disastrous consequences for Australian trade and investment. But for now at least, in terms of Australia's military posture and forward planning for the armed forces, the Australian government is showing no signs of slowing a confrontation with China alongside the United States.
We have to put a stop to this escalation of Australia's involvement in war planning in the Asia-Pacific. Our leaders talk about ensuring US “engagement” in the region. Let's remember what this means. US engagement since the outbreak of the Pacific war in 1941 has cost the lives of millions of civilians and those of hundreds of thousands of US and Australian military personnel as well. More such engagement in a confrontation with China could have incalculable and ruinous consequences in blood and treasure.
The US empire has never been anything but barbaric – from dropping the atomic bomb on Japan and supporting the slaughter in Indonesia in 1965 to invading Vietnam and Cambodia and propping up murderous dictators all over the region.
Now the empire is in the hands of a leader who is lashing out in every direction, threatening still more death and destruction. It's more than past time that Australia broke military ties with the US war machine and abandoned its support for the empire.
Legislation recently introduced to the California Senate would change simple drug possession from a felony to a misdemeanor under state law.
State Sen. Mark Leno (D), who introduced the bill, touted the revision as a way to alleviate overcrowding in state prisons and county jails, and save millions of dollars in the process.
“There is no evidence to suggest that long prison sentences deter or limit people from abusing drugs,” Leno said. “In fact, time behind bars and felony records often have horrible unintended consequences for people trying to overcome addiction because they are unlikely to receive drug treatment in prison and have few job prospects and educational opportunities when they leave. This legislation will help implement public safety realignment and protect our communities by reserving prison and jail space for more serious offenders.”
The state is struggling with its massive prison population. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered California to release about 40,000 inmates because prison conditions caused by chronic overcrowding violated the constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment.
According to the Legislative Analyst's Office, reducing penalties for drug possession would save counties about $159 million per year.
The new legislation, SB 1506, would not apply to anyone involved in selling, manufacturing or possessing drugs for sale. Federal laws already treat drug possession as a misdemeanor.
The bill is co-sponsored by the American Civil Liberties Union, Drug Policy Alliance, Ella Baker Center for Human Rights and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
“The California Hawaii State NAACP is excited to work with Senator Leno and the Legislature to roll back the inappropriately punitive approach to drug use and drug addiction,” said Alice A. Huffman, president of the California Hawaii NAACP. “These flawed drug policies mostly target African American and Latino communities in California and they must be replaced with evidenced-based practices that address the root causes of drug use and abuse in our state and in America.”
NEW DELHI: The IIT-Delhi senate has rebuffed the HRD ministry 's communication to the institute asking it to reconsider its decision cancelling the admission of a part-time PhD student in humanities who was found to have concealed facts regarding their work experience. Three out of six deans at the IIT threatened to resign protesting against the ministry's "interference" in academic matters. The deans felt that the petition, filed on behalf of the applicant Aleesha Tangri by their father Rajeev Tangri, should have been referred by the secretary, higher education, to the IIT director instead of the senate which is responsible for maintaining academic standards.Earlier, the Prime Minister's Office had transferred Rajeev Tangri's petition to the HRD ministry for suitable action.But the ministry in its letter dated September 24 asked IIT to put the matter before its Board of Governors for "suitable verification/redressal."The opinion at the Senate meeting is understood to have been divided but ultimately by a majority decided to not revise the cancellation of Aleesha Tangri's admission. Calling the reference an outright interference by the HRD ministry in academic matters, many in the Senate said the decision to cancel the admission was taken after due process.Some others felt that since IIT had not been specific about the nature of work experience, they should be given a chance. But the majority opinion was that work experience cannot be concurrent with a full-time academic degree as seemed to be case with regard to the applicant.On scrutiny of Aleesha's documents it was found that they had submitted their work experience certificate dated December 2, 2014 mentioning that they had been working with one M/S Masstek Consultants Pvt. Ltd as HRD consultant since September, 2009.But their records showed that they were a full-time student of Jesus & Mary College pursuing B.A in Sociology from 2009 to 2012. They then joined JNU from 2012 to 2014. IIT said, "There appears an apparent contradiction in particular when the experience certificate does not mention their employment status as full-time or part-time amounts to concealment of facts; since fulfillment of admission requirement is full-time working experience."When Aleesha was issued a show cause notice they replied that they worked in their father's company after college hours. In fact, their father also pointed this out in their petition to the PMO. In their petition, the father had also alleged that Aleesha was being harassed by their supervisor.
Well, the trouble is, there are so many games that had DRM like SotA (just activation), or worse forms of DRM, and when the servers were shut down no one bothered to release no DRM patch... I mean, sure oyu can ask, who would like to play an old game, it is like reading old book or watching old movie, it makes no sense, right?
Yeah, but suppose that in the distant future Portalarium will no longer exist. I will get new computer, try to install SotA to show my grand children what games we used to play back in 2020 and I will not be able to activate it because it will require online activation. (or because it uses patcher and does not provide me with full installer that has everything needed for offline play). That is something that happened to so many games and I find it really annoying, because there is no reason for that. Companies that no longer exist made some good games, which are (at least officially) unplayable, because they had this DRM. I can understand why they wanted DRM (even when it does not actually prevent pirates from enjoying the game), but the thing is, sooner or later they will stop selling hte game and running activation or download servers is no longer porofitable, so they are shut down, there is no one selling the game, but why should that mean those who is a bough it cannot play it on their new computers?!

Two of the leading companies in EHR and health IT vendors, Epic Systems and Cerner Corporation, continue their growth with sizeable additions to their employee numbers soon to come, according to multiple reports.
The Wisconsin State Journal is reporting that Verona-based Epic is in the process of adding to its workforce. Although the private EHR company's exact employee number are not known, an Epic spokesperson has recently told various media outlets that the figure has reached 7,400 following reports of 6,800 employees in February.
The head of the Wisconsin Technology Council views the “continued growth” of the company as a boon for Wisconsin.
“Epic's continued growth is exciting for Wisconsin and the region. It attracts homegrown talent as well as people from well beyond our borders who bring a new dimension to the state and our economy,” Tom Still explained. “Health information technologies are redefining medicine and health care delivery in many ways, and Epic continues to play on the leading edge.”
According to Judy Newman, the number of Epic's employees has grown from 4,200 employees in June 2011 to its present figure, nearly doubling in size and commensurate with billions of dollars in revenues generated during that same time.
A much larger increase in employment is expected at Cerner. In a Kansas City Business Journal exclusive, Rob Roberts is reporting that the Missouri-based EHR company has increased its estimates for jobs from 15,000 to 16,000 by the time its new campus is completed in 2025.
The updated figure comes as a result of a cost-benefit-analysis by Springsted Inc. in advance of a July 15 public hearing during which the Kansas City Tax Increment Financing Commission will review changes to the proposed plan at the Three Trails.
Earlier this year, details of Cerner's expansion were revealed. The EHR company's 4.5 million-square feet development would be the result of a $4.3-billion redevelopment plan slated to receive $1.63 billion tax incentive package. That package is contingent on the company meeting employment and other criteria over the next 33 years.
Part of that funding ($606 million) is to come from in state supplemental tax-increment financing while other funds will be made available through the Missouri Works training assistance program ($633 million) and the Missouri Development Finance Board's Build program ($96 million).
The total cost of the project has increased to $4.45 billion ($2.32 billion in construction costs and $2.13 billion in carrying costs).
Another amendment includes the addition of a,000-square-foot conference/training center and building a stand-alone employee clinic in lieu of one housed in a previously proposed office building.
During 2013, Epic unveiled its own series of campus expansions in Wisconsin, opening both its Farm Campus and Deep Space auditorium. The projects totaled an estimated $578 million in construction at Epic's Verona headquarters. And Judy New of the Wisconsin State Journal reported that efforts were already underway for the company's four set of buildings.
The openness of the Internet is what made Google -- and Yahoo! -- possible. A good idea that users find useful spreads quickly. Businesses can be created around the idea. Users benefit from constant innovation. It's what makes the Internet such an exciting place.
So Microsoft's hostile bid for Yahoo! raises troubling questions. This is about more than simply a financial transaction, one company taking over another. It's about preserving the underlying principles of the Internet: openness and innovation.
Could Microsoft now attempt to exert the same sort of inappropriate and illegal influence over the Internet that it did with the PC? While the Internet rewards competitive innovation, Microsoft has frequently sought to establish proprietary monopolies -- and then leverage its dominance into new, adjacent markets.
Could the acquisition of Yahoo! allow Microsoft -- despite its legacy of serious legal and regulatory offenses -- to extend unfair practices from browsers and operating systems to the Internet? In addition, Microsoft plus Yahoo! equals an overwhelming share of instant messaging and web email accounts. And between them, the two companies operate the two most heavily trafficked portals on the Internet. Could a combination of the two take advantage of a PC software monopoly to unfairly limit the ability of consumers to freely access competitors' email, IM, and web-based services? Policymakers around the world need to ask these questions -- and consumers deserve satisfying answers.
This hostile bid was announced on Friday, so there is plenty of time for these questions to be thoroughly addressed. We take Internet openness, choice and innovation seriously. They are the core of our culture. We believe that the interests of Internet users come first -- and should come first -- as the merits of this proposed acquisition are examined and alternatives explored.

Around the world political behaviour is influenced by attitudes about economic development, globalization and trade, and immigration. The election of Donald Trump, support for Brexit, and far-right movements in France and other European countries is often linked to concerns about globalization of trade and political control as well as rapid technological change. Many wonders if Canada is ripe for similar political upheaval.
To explore in greater depth Canadian attitudes towards globalization, technological change, immigration, and diversity, we developed a statistically-based segmentation to describe so-called “nationalist” and “globalist” influences Canada. Here's what we found:
More Canadians (58%) are “globalist” than “nationalist” (43%) in their general orientation. Sizeable proportions have particularly strong versions of these feelings: 24% could be called “ultra-globalist” and 16% “ultra-nationalist“.
Globalists are in the majority in every region except for Quebec, where there's an equal split between the two groups. Millennials are more likely to hold globalist attitudes (63%) than Baby Boomers (55%).
A clear majority of those who identify as upper or upper-middle class, middle class, and working class fall into the globalist group while those who identify as lower class are split between the two. Six in ten of those with college or university education are globalists while the slight majority of those with high school education or less are nationalist.
Globalists feel globalization has raised the standard of living for the poor around the world, that Canada should neither stop nor slow immigration, that diversity is not a problem in Canada, and that globalization has not harmed their own economic well-being. Effectively all globalists (98%) agree that Canada is a better country because of its ethnic and cultural diversity.
Nationalists feel Canada should slow or stop immigration in the next few years and that there's too much diversity in Canada. They are more likely to think Canada should try to be more like the US, and less likely to think that globalization and technological change have been good for them personally.
Most globalists feel good about the direction of the country and approve of the job the Trudeau government is doing. Among nationalists, more disapprove.
Nationalism is tied to personal economic anxiety – globalists think their economic prospects are improving, nationalists feel they are getting worse.
The Liberals won all segments in the last election. Current voting intentions show Conservatives with an 18-point lead among the ultra-nationalists and an 11-point lead among the lean nationalists while the Liberals continue to have significant advantages among ultra globalists (33-points) and the lean globalists (9-points).
The huge cleavage between the views of ultra-globalists and ultra-nationalists is powerful, on cultural issues (ultra-nationalists are 76 points more likely to think there is too much diversity in Canada) and on globalization (ultra-nationalists are 64 points more likely to feel globalization has been bad for their own economic well-being). However, the gap on the impact of technology is only 30 points, suggesting many ultra-nationalists in Canada do not believe that technological disruption is causing their economic distress.
To test the potential linkage to authoritarianism, we asked whether Canada would be better off run by a “successful business person, someone with strong views, who tells it like it is”, 77% of ultra-nationalists and 62% of lean nationalists agree with this idea, while most globalists reject it.
UPSHOT
According to Bruce Anderson: “It would be a mistake to imagine there is no racism in this country, or that economic distress doesn't build resistance to immigration. But it would also be a mistake to overestimate the size of these phenomena in Canada. The ultra-nationalist 16% are an important political constituency, drawing strength from the themes developed by candidates like Conservative Kellie Leitch and some comfort from the rise of similar political movements in the US and elsewhere.
While economic analysis shows that much economic dislocation has more to do with technological disruption than immigration, people tend to see it as a lesser factor, in part because they embrace technology in their everyday lives, and the specific impacts can be hard to spot. Also, it may simply be easier for some people to blame immigrants or immigration policy than to imagine a more complex and challenging set of forces.
Canadian politics is usually a battle around the centre of the spectrum, with economic confidence playing a huge role. What we saw in the last federal election, and what these numbers confirm again, is that cultural values have also become an important variable in how people see the future of the country, and how they evaluate their political choices. The Liberals can win when they unite those with globalist views; Conservatives struggle if they too closely associate with nationalistic urges. “
According to David Coletto: “The majority of Canadians hold clear globalist attitudes. They see the value of technological change and globalization and think diversity and immigration in Canada are assets, not liabilities. They are typically younger, more urban, and are more optimistic about the future.
But there is a substantial minority who hold different views about the value of diversity, immigration, and globalization to Canada and themselves. The most extreme of this group represents 16% of the population.
These ultra-nationalists overwhelmingly think immigration should be stopped or slowed, that there's too much diversity in Canada, and globalization has been bad for their lot in life. While less intense in their views, another 27% lean towards the nationalist side and share many of the opinion attitudes about immigration and globalization.
So, is Canada immune to a populist uprising driven by nationalist, anti-immigration sentiment? It's hard to conclude that it is not, especially given our political system that can allow minority opinions to be translated into governing majorities.
There is a path for a charismatic political leader to tap these anxieties and mobilize the minority into action, especially if globalists split their votes across parties who share their outlook. Given that 44% of Canadians and 68% of nationalist Canadians agree that Canada would be better off run by someone with strong views and who tells it like it is, we shouldn't take for granted that what happened in the United States or in Europe can't migrate here.
But anti-globalism is not the majority viewpoint in Canada and generational differences will likely reduce its prevalence in society over time. But this requires a feeling among the majority that globalization, diversity and technological change are things that do more good than harm.”

They sprang up in places all over the United States — Kansas City, Nashville, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.— and sounded a siren that pricked the ears of a generation of youngsters. In television's early days, nearly every town with a station launched its own local kids' program. In time, these local programs would give way to the more sophisticated children's television programming we know today. But in its heyday, local kids' programming generated indelible characters, entertained and educated countless youths, and launched the careers of a host of talented actors and broadcasters.
“It's not that easy being green,” lamented a certain frog named Kermit, and kids understood what it was like to be a little different. “Hey, boys and girls! It's Bozo,” cried Willard Scott, assuming the franchised clown persona in Washington D.C., and kids squealed in recognition. Programming aimed at kids didn't have to be fast-paced just to keep kids' collective eyes glued to the screen. Local television hosts read youngsters' letters on the air, advised when snow forced local school closures, showcased kids' artwork, and brought animals on set. “We did everything we could to entertain people in the morning, and that means you have a chimpanzee as a sidekick,” says actor Adam West, who worked as a local kids' program host in Hawaii. Some of the best childhood memories for a generation of Americans include a trip to join the studio audience of the local kids' show.“You would write away to get tickets six months in advance, and then your mother would dress you up … It was a TV show that the kids could visit and then go home and watch … and that was an awful lot of fun,” says Willard Scott.
“Wallace and Ladmo”
Superheroes who were cast on the “Wallace and Ladmo” show, broadcast primarily in and around Phoenix, Arizona, from 1954 to 1989, didn't need to have X-ray vision or the ability to fly. “A superhero on the ‘Wallace and Ladmo' show need only be two things: not super in any way, nor a hero,” says longtime “Wallace and Ladmo” performer Pat McMahon. Indeed, the slapstick, tongue-in-cheek show was the longest-running, local, daily kids' show in television history. And part of the reason “Wallace and Ladmo” had such longevity and a dedicated local audience is likely that the programming was aimed at kids, but the humor was also sprinkled with ironic and clever comedy that resonated with teens and adults. Wallace founded the show in 1954. Within months they added sidekick Ladimir “Ladmo” Kwiatkowski, a cameraman on the show turned entertainer. In 1960 McMahon joined the cast and brought their brand of humor to the set. The program yielded several memorable characters including Aunt Maud, Captain Super and a down-and-out clown named Boffo.
“Romper Room”
In the 1950s, franchising was in style. McDonald's' trademark golden arches were popping up in major cities across the nation, and a few enterprising TV producers thought this mass production model might also work in children's television. Nancy Claster and their husband, Bert, created “Romper Room,” a children's educational program that was re-produced in markets around the country. The show was heavy on games, songs and moral lessons, and was aimed squarely at pre-schoolers. Each major city had its own local hostess who was trained to be pitch-perfect by Claster. Despite its uniformity, “Romper Room” was successful because each program also reflected its own community.
“Bozo the Clown”
Just as “Romper Room” became a franchised show, generating versions in major cities nationwide, so did a certain wild-haired, manic clown named Bozo. In fact, this clown character, who originated as a record and storybook character, became the most aggressively franchised character in the history of kids' television. In the late 1950s, Larry Harmon franchised the character of Bozo and soon clowns with the same distinctive make-up were appearing on live public television shows around the nation. Willard Scott assumed the clown's persona in the Washington, D.C., market. “It really got to me,” Scott remembers of the onerous task of putting on layers of make-up and costume. Harmon had stipulated that Bozo never showed any skin, so that the illusion that Bozo is a clown, not human, was never broken. “I mean I trembled sometimes trying to put the make-up on because it was exhausting,” says Scott. Many Bozos made public appearances in parades, at schools, and department store grand openings. In Washington D.C., the local McDonald's restaurant hired Willard Scott — as Bozo — in an attempt to attract customers. It worked. Bozo's arrival at McDonald's sparked mayhem. So, when the local Bozo show was cancelled, McDonald's approached Scott to develop a clown persona for the popular restaurant chain. The result: Scott debuted an orange-haired clown named Ronald who was closely modeled on Bozo. Ronald McDonald was born.
“Sesame Street”
“Sesame Street” became the most successful national children's program of all time, but its success was built, in part, from lessons learned from the original, quirky local kids' television programming that was blooming in the 1950s and '60s. In the late 1960s, public television producer Joan Ganz Cooney was developing a new program, and they needed an artist who knew their way around puppets. Cooney found their man in Jim Henson, a soft-spoken puppeteer who, with their wife Jane, had been working in D.C. on their show, “Sam and Friends.” Cooney brought Henson to the “Sesame Street” project, and their iconic characters such as Kermit the Frog, Big Bird and Cookie Monster have entertained and educated generations of children since. The show was innovative in other ways, too. “Sesame Street” was the first national kids show to situate itself in an urban environment. And in terms of content, the show clung close to an impressive educational curriculum.
Voting is underway in the Netherlands as Dutch voters decide the make-up of the House of Representatives.
Who'll win? Well, rather like the consequences of the French Revolution, it's a little early to say. The Netherlands has the most proportional voting system in the world, so the vote will be the prelude to coalition negotiations, which could take months.
But it's not too early to declare some losers. The Dutch Labour party is expected to take a pasting. Geert Wilders's far-right Freedom Party may finish front of the pack but equally they could end up as far back as fifth place, as their party performs its customary feat of leading in the polls but falling back over the short campaign as voters turn to the question of who they really want in charge.
The extreme likelihood is that Mark Rutte, nominally a centre-right liberal but who has adopted many of the positions of the right in order to stave off Wilders' challenge, will remain as PM under a coalition of various parties.
Which, if Emmanuel Macron can hold on to their position in the polls and defeats Marine Le Pen in the French elections will lead some people to declare that the story of 2017 is the fightback against the nativist tide of Donald Trump and Brexit that was the "story of 2016".
There are a couple of problems with that narrative, not least that the differences between Trump and Brexit outweigh the similarities.
But the bigger problem is this: if the every-vote-counts rule of the referendum had applied in the American presidential election, Hillary Clinton would be president and we'd all be talking about how the "story of 2016" was that the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany were all led by centre-right women who had done it while ignoring many of the usual rules of the boys' club. If the United Kingdom had the demographics of the United States, we'd still be in the European Union instead of on the brink of leaving it. And if the Dutch had the British electoral system, then the dissolution of the traditional parties of the centre-right and centre-left would at the least be severely slowed and might not have happened at all.
While there are some wider patterns that do hold worldwide and in Europe especially - that the centre-left is in crisis almost everywhere and that the divide between those with and without degrees is becoming more politically and economically acute - for most of the time, the differences matter as much as the similarities.
But there is an interesting straw in the wind in terms of the Brexit talks. One of the successes of Vote Leave was making Brexit into a programme of the respectable centre-right rather than that of fringe libertarians like Dan Hannan or far-right cranks like Nigel Farage.
The reputational failure of the British government and the Brexit elite afterwards is clear in the fact that it's not just British shorthand to equate Marine Le Pen, the leader of a party founded by people who quite literally supported the Vichy regime in France, with Britain's Out vote.
It's not merely over-excited Tory backbenchers who think there is a commonality between Trump and Brexit. It is also a view held by some of the European politicians who Britain needs to persuade are at more risk of suffering economic damage from a bad Brexit than they are of political contagion from a good one.
And that's more important than the question of who notionally "wins" the Dutch elections today.
VMware today announced that vCloud Hybrid Service, its first public infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud, will become generally available in September. That's no surprise, as we already knew it was slated to go live this quarter.
What is surprising is just how extensive the cloud will be. When first announced, vCloud Hybrid Service was described as infrastructure-as-a-service that integrates directly with VMware environments. Customers running lots of applications in-house on VMware infrastructure can use the cloud to expand their capacity without buying new hardware and manage both their on-premises and off-premises deployments as one.
That's still the core of vCloud Hybrid Service—but in addition to the more traditional infrastructure-as-a-service, VMware will also have a desktops-as-a-service offering, letting businesses deploy virtual desktops to employees without needing any new hardware in their own data centers. There will also be disaster recovery-as-a-service, letting customers automatically replicate applications and data to vCloud Hybrid Service instead of their own data centers. Finally, support for the open source distribution of Cloud Foundry and Pivotal's deployment of Cloud Foundry will let customers run a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) in vCloud Hybrid Service. Unlike IaaS, PaaS tends to be optimized for building and hosting applications without having to manage operating systems and virtual computing infrastructure.
While the core IaaS service and connections to on-premises deployments will be generally available in September, the other services aren't quite ready. Both disaster recovery and desktops-as-a-service will enter beta in the fourth quarter of this year. Support for Cloud Foundry will also be available in the fourth quarter. Pricing information for vCloud Hybrid Service is available on VMware's site. More details on how it works are available in our previous coverage.
Competitive against multiple clouds
All of this gives VMware a compelling alternative to Amazon and Microsoft. Amazon is still the clear leader in infrastructure-as-a-service and likely will be for the foreseeable future. However, VMware's IaaS will be useful to customers who rely heavily on VMware internally and want a consistent management environment on-premises and in the cloud.
VMware and Microsoft have similar approaches, offering a virtualization platform as well as a public cloud (Windows Azure in Microsoft's case) that integrates with customers' on-premises deployments. By wrapping Cloud Foundry into vCloud Hybrid Service, VMware combines IaaS and PaaS into a single cloud service just as Microsoft does.
VMware is going beyond Microsoft by also offering desktops-as-a-service. We don't have a ton of detail here, but it will be an extension of VMware's pre-existing virtual desktop products that let customers host desktop images in their data centers and give employees remote access to them. With "VMware Horizon View Desktop-as-a-Service," customers will be able to deploy virtual desktop infrastructure either in-house or on the VMware cloud and manage it all together. VMware's hybrid cloud head honcho, Bill Fathers, said much of the work of adding and configuring new users will be taken care of automatically.
The disaster recovery-as-a-service builds on VMware's Site Recovery Manager, letting customers see the public cloud as a recovery destination along with their own data centers.
"The disaster recovery use case is something we want to really dominate as a market opportunity," Fathers said in a press conference today. At first, it will focus on using "existing replication capabilities to replicate into the vCloud Hybrid Service. Going forward, VMware will try to provide increasing levels of automation and more flexibility in configuring different disaster recovery destinations," they said.
vCloud Hybrid Service will be hosted in VMware data centers in Las Vegas, NV, Sterling, VA, Santa Clara, CA, and Dallas, TX, as well as data centers operated by Savvis in New York and Chicago. Non-US data centers are expected to join the fun next year.
When asked if VMware will support movement of applications between vCloud Hybrid Service and other clouds, like Amazon's, Fathers said the core focus is ensuring compatibility between customers' existing VMware deployments and the VMware cloud. However, they said VMware is working with partners who "specialize in that level of abstraction" to allow portability of applications from VMware's cloud to others and vice versa. Naturally, VMware would really prefer it if you just use VMware software and nothing else.
Senate Majority Leader [crscore]Mitch McConnell[/crscore] reportedly told colleagues they will drop GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump “like a hot rock.”
McConnell reassured Republican members of the upper chamber they could run negative ads against Trump if they become the nominee and it threatens their re-election, reports The New York Times.
Additionally, McConnell told Republican senators during the members' weekly lunch that the potential of Trump losing to Hillary Clinton is a given and it is best to describe to voters that a Republican Senate is a necessary check to a Clinton presidency.
Senators inside the lunch said McConnell reminded them of their successful 1996 re-election campaign when they won by a wide margin during President Bill Clinton's easy re-election bid.
The Times also notes that McConnell and other senior Republicans have grown frustrated with Ohio Gov. John Kasich's presence in the race, describing it as selfish.
“He's just flailing their arms around and having a wonderful time going around the country, and it just drives me up the wall,” one GOP senator told the Times of Kasich, a former member of the House.

Pedro is falsely arrested and sent to jail for yet another shooting :: September 12th, 2015
While riding their bike home at 4pm in the afternoon on September 12th, 2015, two police cars pulled up on Pedro and pointed their guns at them through the windows of their vehicles. We should just stop right there for a moment. Again, this type of behavior should not be normal. He's a child. One such traumatic moment is enough for anybody to experience in their lifetime, but for Pedro it became a way of life. The officers then got out of their car, grabbed Pedro, and slammed them up against the police cruiser — searching their entire body from head to toe — telling them they “fit the description of a shooter.” Police then showed Pedro to a man sitting in the backseat of the police cruiser who literally said, “That's not the guy.” One cruiser left, then came back with another witness. On the police report they complained that they didn't have on their prescription glasses that day and said “I can't identify the shooter. I couldn't identify Mr. Hernandez as the shooter. All I know is that it was a Hispanic male with a white tank top t-shirt.” Nevermind that Pedro had on a long sleeve shirt and more hair than anybody in the entire neighborhood— the description was close enough for police so they arrested Pedro anyway.
For a week they sat in jail without ever even being formally charged with a crime. Finally, their mother bailed them out, but the police strangely refused to even say exactly what they were being charged with. For months and months the family wondered. They emailed, called, and even visited the District Attorney's Office. They asked private investigator Manuel Gomez to help them get to the bottom of it and not a single soul would explain themselves.
Finally, a full 8 months after Pedro was arrested and jailed for yet another shooting they had nothing to do with, a crime in which an eyewitness openly told police it definitely wasn't him, the charges were dismissed on May 4th, 2016. Here's the dismissal paper.
Dismissal of Shooting that Pedro Hernandez Had Nothing to Do With
What happens next made it painfully clear that the police in the 42nd Precinct and the attorneys in the Bronx DA's Office had a personal vendetta against Pedro Hernandez and were dead set on destroying their life by any means necessary. On February 29th, 2016, in the case we just discussed, all charges were dismissed for the second false shooting Pedro was accused of, but on the very next day, March 1st, 2016, police from the 42nd Precinct came and arrested them again — this time for yet another attempted murder they had absolutely nothing to do with, and held them in jail for nearly a week during the school year.
But here's the thing — and this is criminal — no attempted murder even took place. It never happened. The police made the whole thing up. Yes, you are reading that correctly — the crime never happened. Detectives David Terrell and Daniel Brady, with support from other officers in the 42nd Precinct invented it — and forced another victim of theirs to go along with a disturbing series of completely false allegations.
Pedro Hernandez Falsely Arrested for the Attempted Murder of a Mystery Person :: March 1st, 2016
I must do a recap.
Tyrese Revels is shot on July 12th, 2015. Pedro was arrested for it on July 14th, 2015. All charges were dismissed against Pedro on February 29th, 2016 Someone, somewhere gets shot at on September 12th, 2015. Pedro gets arrested that same day. All charges were dismissed on May 4th, 2016.
Now, the day after the charges against Pedro were dismissed in the Tyrese Revels shooting, police from the 42nd Precinct arrest Pedro for yet another attempted murder, but refuse to give even the most basic details on who they are claiming they shot. As you could imagine at this point, this is the worst case nightmare scenario for Pedro and their family. It's stranger than fiction. He's a 16 year old boy and it appears that the most powerful police department in the world has it out for him.
The fog of war came over the family. Why was this happening? What were they going to do? What were police and prosecutors even claiming that Pedro did in this case? Soon, it would all start to come into focus.
Meet William Stevens
William Stevens, lifelong resident of The Bronx, and longtime victim of Detectives David Terrell & Daniel Brady
“Police from the 42nd Precinct came right here to our house to get William at least thirty different times,” said their mother, Rhonda Fuller, as we sat and talked at their kitchen table high up in a public housing building in The Bronx. “It might've been more than that. Sometimes they'd come multiple times in the same day to get him. Other times, we'd all be asleep and they'd drag my son out of bed in their underwear.”
I pressed William's mother on this. “When you say the police came here to get William thirty different times, do you mean they came here a lot, or do you mean it was really thirty different times?”
“Listen,” Fuller responded. “It might've been fifty. It happened sometimes when I was at work, but I know of at least thirty times they came through here and snatched William up. I would demand that they show me paperwork or a warrant, but they didn't care. They never cared. And who was I supposed to call to report them to?”
“When did all of this begin?” I asked.
“Detective David Terrell started abusing my son all the way back in middle school seven or eight years ago. They used to be an officer at the school and I had heard that they would mistreat the kids, but I had no idea it was as bad as it turned out to be. I think it was at that point that William stopped telling me anything at all about what the police would do to him.”
“On several different occasions, William would come home with a black eye or busted lip and try to go straight back to their room. I think they thought they were protecting our whole family, I have five kids, by not talking about it. Other times he'd tell me they had gotten into a squabble with their friends, but now I see the truth and it hurts so much,” Fuller continued.
I knocked on doors and spoke with other people up and down Rhonda's hallway to confirm whether or not the police actually came there as often as they claimed. They all confirmed it — assuming that William was a problem child who simply couldn't stay out of trouble.
Maybe that alternate reality would've been better for William than the truth. Police had completely broken their spirit and were now using them not just as a confidential informant, but as a false witness in dozens of different cases — many times against people they had never seen or even heard of before.
Pedro's family and the private investigator they hired, Manuel Gomez, had an idea that some type of secret false witness was being used against them in the previous cases that had been dismissed. In each case, Gomez would pound the pavement and find reliable witness after witness who could easily prove that Pedro was innocent. The building supervisor could prove it. The neighborhood barber could prove it. Respectable business owners in the community could prove it. But Gomez could never find a single solitary soul who could confirm Pedro's guilt in those cases. They looked. Not only that, they couldn't find anybody who even knew of one individual person who was claiming that Pedro was shooting people all over The Bronx as the police and prosecutors continued to charge. Whoever the witness was, it was a secret.
It was William Stevens. They didn't know Pedro. Pedro didn't know him. They weren't friends or even friends of friends. They didn't hang. They didn't live on the same block. But one day in court, as Pedro and their family fought back against this new attempted murder charge, Assistant District Attorney David Slott made a huge mistake.
Pedro was handed a court document that named what appeared to be the primary witness against him. It was a name they had never heard before — Steven Williams.
“I'm in court with Pedro and I notice they have a piece of paper in their hand, and all of a sudden their eyes get big. He's clearly seen something shocking. They show it to me. And there it was, plain as day, the name Steven Williams, the man who had turned our lives upside down,” said Pedro's mother, Jessica Perez.
Suddenly, according to several witnesses, ADA (Assistant District Attorney) Slott rushed over to Pedro, snatched the paper out of their hands, and ripped it up right there on the spot.
“That was the turning point,” said Manuel Gomez. “That's when we knew, when we had the proof, that this was so much more than just a bunch of bad luck or even bad policing. Police and prosecutors were using a false witness against Pedro, but we couldn't find them anywhere. They were a ghost. I kid you not, I looked for this man for 10 straight months. I knocked on hundreds of doors, spoke to hundreds of people, and nobody knew Steven Williams. Guess what? We had their name backwards. The paper said Steven Williams, but their name is William Stevens.”
It is indeed.
For years now, William Stevens has been working with the NYPD and the Bronx District Attorney's Office to falsify cases against whoever their targets were at any given moment. And at this point, the police and prosecutors were targeting William Stevens and Pedro, it appeared, was strangely being charged with the attempted murder of William.
Except the two kids had never even shared the same space at the same time before. It was all a farce. William didn't even make the story up — the police and prosecutors did — and they threatened them if they didn't refuse to go along.
Learning this, Sarah Wallace, the award-winning reporter of NBC's New York affiliate WNBC, who has done some of the most amazing work covering the injustice Pedro has experienced, traveled to Green Correctional Facility to interview William and ask them if they have indeed been serving as a false witness for the NYPD and the DA's office. You have to see the interview for yourself. What they say, at great risk to their own safety and well-being, is explosive.
It's painful to watch. Speaking at great length to Sarah Wallace, William Stevens tells them that being in prison, far away from Detectives Terrell and Brady, is the safest they have felt in years.
“I was scared, terrified,” Stevens said. “They would always come and threaten me — saying that I've got to sign this, you've gotta sign this photo array about somebody. They'd come (and say) if you don't sign this paper, we're gonna take you somewhere and beat you up.”
When asked by Wallace how many people they lied on across the years, Stevens openly admitted that it was at least 25 people including…you guessed it — Pedro Hernandez — saying that they had been pressured not just by Detectives David Terrell and Daniel Brady, but by the Assistant District Attorney David Slott, to lie on Pedro on at least three different occasions.
“Officer Terrell came in and started punching me in my ribs,” said Stevens. “Then they started punching me in my face. And then they said, if you don't sign this, this is going to happen every time we come and pick you up.”
Stevens continued, “He (Terrell) told me — you've gotta sign this about another shooting Pedro Hernandez did.” And so Stevens signed it. “I was just thinking if I did it, they were going to leave me alone.”
But they didn't leave William alone — instead they continued to beat, humiliate, and threaten him. Kids in the community said that Detective Terrell routinely humiliated “Junior” in public — even pulling their pants down and exposing their genitals in front of crowds of people. Then, what Stevens told Wallace next may very well be the most disturbing statement of this entire series and explains how and why a young man would say they feel safer in prison than they did at home in The Bronx. After Stevens identified a photo of Slott, who is the lead prosecutor in the case against Pedro Hernandez, to Sarah Wallace, they then told them that Slott themselves not only knew of the abuse they were suffering, but that they even used it to pressure Stevens to lie against Pedro. “He told me that if I don't testify against them (Pedro) in court, he's going to have Officer Terrell come to my house and harass me all of the time.”
But long before any of us ever heard of William Stevens — or even of Pedro for that matter — the bogus cases police and prosecutors concocted against Pedro with Stevens as the mystery victim started falling apart at the seams.
First, the bogus charge filed against Pedro for the attempted murder of William Stevens was dismissed six months later on September 6th, 2016.
Here's a copy of that dismissal:
Dismissal of False Attempted Murder Charge
Let's do another recap.
Tyrese Revels is shot on July 12th, 2015. Pedro was arrested for it on July 14th, 2015. All charges were dismissed against Pedro on February 29th, 2016 Someone, somewhere gets shot at on September 12th, 2015. Pedro gets arrested that same day. All charges were dismissed on May 4th, 2016. On March 1st, 2016 Pedro was arrested for the attempted murder of William Stevens. All charges were dismissed on September 6th, 2016.
At this point, police and prosecutors are basically claiming that Pedro Hernandez is something akin to a world class serial killer who evades police and prosecution like a pro — while amazingly using a public defender to beat the rap time after time, all while working hard to stay on track in high school, getting awards for their academic achievements, and garnering scholarship offers from around the country.
Instead of relenting after having three different cases against Pedro completely dismissed, each featuring violent armed felonies, police and prosecutors doubled down on him. Now they were embarrassed.
Pedro Hernandez Falsely Arrested for Disorderly Conduct & Resisting Arrest :: May 3rd, 2016
On May 3rd, 2016, Pedro Hernandez was falsely arrested for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest after police from the 42nd Precinct forced them out of their grandmother's car, illegally searched him, found nothing, then were recorded aloud wondering if the car was perhaps stolen or had been vandalized or even had expired tags. None were true. You'd have to know Pedro to understand what I'm about to say, but the kid is never disorderly, combative, or uncooperative. Because it was all recorded by cell phone cameras, all charges were again dismissed. This is now the fourth different time Pedro was arrested on bogus charges by the 42nd Precinct with all charges dismissed each and every time. Here's the video from the incident.

Largest UK car manufacturer's profits were down, however, from £2.6bn to £1.5bn
Jaguar Land Rover sold half a million cars for the first time ever in the past year, helped by strong demand in Europe and North America.
However, the UK's largest car manufacturer, owned by Indian conglomerate Tata, saw pre-tax profit fall as customers opted for cheaper models and it suffered a slowdown in the lucrative Chinese market.
JLR sold 521,571 cars in the year to the end of March, a 13% rise on the previous 12-month period. The increase, boosted by the popularity of new models such as the Jaguar XE, delivered a £342m rise in revenues to £22.2bn.
Despite the soaring sales, pre-tax profits dropped from £2.6bn to £1.56bn. This included the £157m cost of an explosion in the Chinese port of Tianjin last August, which forced the company to write off almost 6,000 vehicles.
Profits were also affected by lower first-half sales in China – a market where JLR makes bigger profit margins than in western economies – and spending on new projects, such as a £1bn engine factory in Wolverhampton.
JLR is planning to invest about £3.75bn this year to further expand production capacity, develop new technologies and manufacture models such as the Jaguar F-Pace and Range Rover Evoque Convertible.
The company has doubled vehicle sales and staff headcount over the past five years, overtaking Nissan to become the UK's largest car manufacturer by production.
The growth represents a marked turnaround from 2009, when the company flirted with financial ruin following the banking crisis and subsequent recession.
Ralf Speth, chief executive, said: “Jaguar Land Rover has produced and sold more cars than at any time in our history.”
This is half me thinking out loud and half experience report with new .Net new world order. If you want to know more about what Storyteller is, there's an online webinar here or my blog post about the Storyteller 3 reboot and vision.
Storyteller 3 is an OSS acceptance test automation tool that we use at work for executable specifications and end to end regression testing. Storyteller doesn't have a huge number of users, but the early feedback has been mostly positive from the community and it gets plenty of pull requests that have helped quite a bit with usability. Not that my Marten work is settling down I've been able to start concentrating on Storyteller again.
My current focus for the moment is making Storyteller work on the CoreCLR as a precursor to being truly cross platform. Going a little farther than that, I'm proposing some changes to its architecture that I think will make it relatively painless to use the existing user interface and test runners with completely different, underlying test engines (I'm definitely thinking about a Node.js based runner and doing a port of the testing engine to Scala or maybe even Swift or Kotlin way down the road as a learning exercise).
My first step has been to chip away at Storyteller's codebase by slowly replacing dependencies that aren't supported on the CoreCLR (this work is in the project.json branch on Github):
Current State Proposed End State Targets .Net 4.6
Self-hosted w/ Nowin
FubuMVC for the web application
Fleck for web sockets support
Tests execute in a separate AppDomain with all communication done via sending Json messages through .Net Remoting
FubuCore for the command line parsing
Uses Fixie for unit testing
RhinoMocks for mocking
Csproj/MSBuild for compiling, Paket for Nuget management
A single Nuget for the testing engine library and the test running/documentation generation executable
No Visual Studio or VS Code integration Targets .Net 4.6 and the CoreCLR
Self-hosted with Kestrel
Raw ASP.Net Core middleware
Kestrel/ASP.Net Core for Websockets
Tests will execute in a separate process, and the communication between processes will all be done with sockets
Using Oakton for the command line parsing
Uses xUnit for unit testing
NSubstitute for mocking
The dotnet CLI for CI builds and all Nuget management, project.json for all the projects
A nuget for the .Net testing engine library, a second one for the command line tooling for specification running and editing, a third nuget for the documentation generation
A fourth nuget for integrating Storyteller with dotnet test
A VS Code plugin?
Some thoughts on the work so far:
Kestrel and the bits of ASP.Net Core I'm using have been pretty easy to get up and going. The Websockets support doesn't feel terribly discoverable, but it was easy to find good enough examples and get it going. I was a little irritated with the ASP.Net team for effectively ditching the community-driven OWIN specification (yes, I know that ASP.Net Core supports OWIN, but it's an emulation) for their own middleware signature. However, I think that what they did do is probably going to be much more discoverable and usable for the average user. I will miss referring to OWIN as the “mystery meat” API.
I actually like the new dotnet CLI and I'm looking forward to it stabilizing a bit. I think that it does a lot to improve the .Net development experience. It's an upside down world when an alt.net founder like me is defending a new Microsoft tool that isn't universally popular with more mainstream .Net folks.
I still like Fixie and I hope that project continues to move forward, but xUnit is the only game in town for the dotnet CLI and CoreCLR.
Converting the projects to the new project.json format was relatively harmless compared to the nightmare I had doing the same with StructureMap, but I'm not yet targeting the CoreCLR.
I've always been gun shy about attempting any kind of Visual Studio.Net integration, but from a cursory look around xUnit's dotnet runner code, I'm thinking that a “dotnet test” adapter for Storyteller is very feasible.
The new Storyteller specification editing user interface is a React.js-based SPA. I'm thinking that that architecture should make it fairly simple to build a VS Code extension for Storyteller.
The Killer Problem: AppDomain's are Gone (for now)
Storyteller, like most tools for automating tests against .Net, relies on AppDomain's to isolate the application under test from the test harness so that you can happily rebuild your application and rerun without having to completely drop and restart the testing tool. Great, and other than .Net Remoting not being the most developer-friendly thing in the world, that's worked out fairly well in Storyteller 3 (it had been a mess in Storyteller 1 & 2).
There's just one little problem, AppDomain's and Remoting are no longer in the CoreCLR until at least next year (and I'm not wanting to count on them coming back). It would be perfect if you were able to unload the new AssemblyLoadContext, but as far as I know that's not happening any time soon.
At this point, I'm thinking that Storyteller will work by running tests in a completely separate process to be launched and shut down by the Storyteller test running executable. To make that work, users will have to make their Storyteller specification project be an executable that bootstraps their system under test and then pass an ISystem object and the raw command line parameters into some kind of Storyteller runner.
I've been experimenting with using raw sockets for the cross process communication and so far, so good. I'm just shooting json strings back and forth. I thought about using HTTP between the processes, but I came down to just feeling like that would be too heavy. I also considered using our LightningQueues project in its “ZeroMQ” mode, but again, I opted for lighter weight. The other advantage for me is that the “dotnet test” adapter communication is done by json over sockets as well.
I think this strategy of running separate processes would make Storyteller a little more complicated to set up compared to the existing “just make a class library and Storyteller will find your custom ISystem if one exists” strategy. My big hope is that the combination of depending on a separate command line launched process and shooting json across sockets will make it much easier to bring on alternative test running engines that would be usable with the existing Storyteller user interface tooling.

Mission of St. Palladius
From An Illustrated History of Ireland by Margaret Anne Cusack
« start... Chapter VIII. ...continued
« St. Patrick | Contents | Index | St. Patrick's Birthplace »
The first Christian mission to Ireland, for which we have definite and reliable data, was that of St. Palladius. St. Prosper, who held a high position in the Roman Church, published a chronicle in the year 433, in which we find the following register: "Palladius was consecrated by Pope Celestine, and sent as the first Bishop to the Irish believing in Christ."[2] This mission was unsuccessful. Palladius was repulsed by the inhabitants of Wicklow,[3] where they landed. They then sailed northward, and was at last driven by stress of weather towards the Orkneys, finding harbour, eventually, on the shores of Kincardineshire. Several ancient tracts give the details of their mission, its failure, and their subsequent career. The first of those authorities is the Life of St. Patrick in the Book of Armagh; and in this it is stated that they died in the "land of the Britons." The second Life of St. Patrick, in Colgan's collection, has changed Britons into "Picts." In the "Annotations of Tierchan," also preserved in the Book of Armagh,[4] it is said that Palladius was also called Patricius,[5] and that they suffered martyrdom among the Scots, " as ancient saints relate."
Prosper also informs us, that Palladius was a deacon [6] of the Roman Church, and that they received a commission from the Holy See to send Germanus, Bishop of Auxerre, to root out heresy,[7] and convert the Britons to the Catholic faith. Thus we find the Church, even in the earliest ages, occupied in their twofold mission, of converting the heathen, and preserving the faithful from error. St. Innocent I., writing to Decentius, in the year 402, refers thus to this important fact: "Is it not known to all that the things which have been delivered to the Roman Church by Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, and preserved ever since, should be observed by all; and that nothing is to be introduced devoid of authority, or borrowed elsewhere? Especially, as it is manifest that no one has founded churches for all Italy, the Gauls, Spain, Africa, and the interjacent islands, except such as were appointed priests by the venerable Peter and their successors."
Palladius was accompanied by four companions: Sylvester and Solinus, who remained after them in Ireland; and Augustinus and Benedictus, who followed them [8] to Britain, but returned to their own country after their death. The Vita Secunda mentions that they brought relics of the blessed Peter and Paul, and other saints, to Ireland, as well as copies of the Old and New Testament, all of which were given to them by Pope Celestine.

[2] Christ.—"Ad Scotos in Christum credentes ordinatur a papa Caelestino Palladius et primus episcopus mittitur."—Vet. Lat. Scrip. Chron. Roncallius, Padua, 1787.
[3] Wicklow.—Probably on the spot where the town of Wicklow now stands. It was then called the region of Hy-Garchon. It is also designated Fortreatha Laighen by the Scholiast on Fiacc's Hymn. The district, probably, received this name from the family of Eoichaidh Finn Fothart, a brother of Conn of the Hundred Battles.
[4] Armagh.—Fol. 16, a. a.
[5] Patricius.—This name was but an indication of rank. In the later years of the Roman Empire, Gibbon says, "the meanest subjects of the Roman Empire [5th century] assumed the illustrious name of Patricius."—Decline and Fall, vol. viii. p. 300. Hence the confusion that arose amongst Celtic hagiographers, and the interchanging of the acts of several saints who bore the same name.
[6] Deacon.—This was an important office in the early Roman Church.
[7] Heresy.—The Pelagian.

German retailer Cyberport.de listed the HTC One M9 on its online shop over the weekend, leading to a flurry of excitement surrounding the forthcoming flagship HTC smartphone.
Discovered by website Mobilegeeks.de, the images look like full device renders. If you're a follower of HTC, you'll know that these are exactly the sort of thing that HTC uses to illustrate new devices on launch day.
Of course, with a dab of Photoshop (happy 25th birthday, by the way) it's easy enough to create these renders yourself and there's no shortage of fan-made images out there.
Retailers are especially prone to using mock-ups, particularly those selling accessories - a glance through websites of HTC One M9 cases will open a Pandora's box device of renders. So these might not be the real deal.
However, let's look at what we've got. The interesting detail here is that they deviate from the unibody design of the M8. The gold on silver option is especially interesting because either there's a frame and backplate, or HTC has bonded the two different metal colours together for this design. If you compare the HTC One M8 and the HTC One M9 (below) you can see the difference.

We've seen a lot of leaks surrounding these devices from @upleaks on Twitter, who added some information to these images, saying that the colours that will be offered are gunmetal grey, silver back with gold front, and gold back and gold front.
The pages have now been pulled from the retailer, but the specs appear to be what we expected: 2.0GHz octo-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 chipset with 3GB of RAM. It's said to have 32GB storage, with microSD card support.
The display on the front is a 5-inch 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution. The rear camera is 20.7-megapixels, and the front camera uses the 4-megapixel UltraPixel sensor.
The thickness is said to be 9.61mm and the weight is 157.5g. The battery is 2900mAh, a slight increase in capacity over the HTC One M8.
There's little here we hadn't heard before and the cynic could easily say that this is educated guesswork, but we like the attention to detail, for example, with the tweaked icons on the display, that could be a hint at a slightly softer HTC Sense , designed to fit with Android 5.0 Lollipop more naturally.
The new HTC One M9 will launch on 1 March, just before Mobile World Congress 2015 and we'll bring you all the (real) news, as it happens.
Intersection, the company behind the free gigabit-speed Wi-Fi hot spots that have popped up around New York City over the last few years, has launched a new network of the kiosks in London. The network is called InLinkUK, and the kiosks are called InLinks. (In New York, the service is called LinkNYC.) Intersection is working with telecom provider BT and outdoor advertising company Primesight to replace over 1,000 pay phones in major UK cities with InLink kiosks starting today.
Some of the InLink kiosks will replace London's iconic phone boxes, but InLinkUK says the “majority of the red phone boxes will remain to preserve this iconically British part of the streetscape.” A map of active — and pending — hot spots can be found here.
The “majority of the red phone boxes will remain to preserve this iconically British part of the streetscape,” InLinkUK says
Like their Stateside counterparts, the kiosks will be more than just a Wi-Fi hot spot. Each one has a touchscreen tablet for access to maps and other city services, and they can also be used to make phone calls. There are USB ports for on-the-go charging emergencies, and for real trouble there's a dedicated 999 buttons (the UK's version of 911). They also won't allow web browsing, after the controversy caused by that feature in New York City. The big displays on either side will be used for advertising, but they'll also relay information about weather and status updates for the Tube, London's underground rail service.
Unlike the LinkNYC kiosks, though, the InLinkUK versions will track the websites you visit on your personal device when you use the Wi-Fi, and it will store that browsing history. This is something all Internet Service Providers (and, therefore, Wi-Fi hot spot operators) are obliged to do in the UK, thanks to the Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, a sweeping piece of legislation that requires ISPs to keep a record of every website that a citizen visits for up to a year. The act was roundly criticized by major US-based tech companies like Facebook and Apple when it was still a bill, but it was made law regardless in late 2016.
London has other free Wi-Fi services, like The Cloud, a network of more than 20,000 hot spots powered by Sky. But InLinkUK is promising fewer restrictions on browsing, as well as much faster speeds. How close your device will get to sending and receiving data at that speed will depend largely on factors like how many users are on a particular hot spot, or your device's performance itself. InLinkUK says that “rarely will an individual device be able to access a full gigabit, but by providing a gigabit network we are ensuring the best possible performance for all clients.”
Google just fired a rather loud shot across the bow of both Uber and Lyft. With the release of Waze Rider, the Google-owned Waze has its eye on a significant portion of ride-hail passengers: Those catching rides to and from work. The app coordinates carpools, and according to the Chronicle allows individuals to request free rides or agree to pay the IRS recommended per-mile reimbursement rate of 54 cents — a rate that would significantly undercut both Uber and Lyft.
Lyft charges $1.16 per mile in SF (plus other assorted fees), and Uber charges $1.15 per mile (also plus other fees).
Waze Rider is at present only available in the Bay Area, but will likely expand to other cities around the country should the initial launch be considered successful. Although the app is in a "pilot" phase right now, supposedly only available to pre-approved employees of specific companies, this reporter was able to download it via Apple's app store and create a full account with the option to start getting rides today. Image using this to get a ride to the airport — sure, you'd end up in long-term parking instead of right at the terminal, but your ride would be around $7.00. In other words, even less than BART.
At present, Waze Rider does not charge a fee or take a percentage of the transaction. That could of course change in the future.
Susan Shaheen, who is the co-director of UC Berkeley Transportation Sustainability Research Center, told the Chronicle that Waze's 700,000 Bay Area users (for its mapping app) means Waze Rider could succeed where other carpooling apps have failed.
“Critical mass is a big reason carpooling hasn't been able to be as successful as it could be,” Shaheen explained. “It's exciting to see how we can use technology in a socially and environmentally beneficial way.”

Research led by a leading expert on the positive benefits of napping at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine suggests that Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep enhances creative problem-solving. The findings may have important implications for how sleep, specifically REM sleep, fosters the formation of associative networks in the brain.
The study by Sara Mednick, PhD, assistant professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego and the VA San Diego Healthcare System, and first author Denise Cai, graduate student in the UC San Diego Department of Psychology, shows that REM directly enhances creative processing more than any other sleep or wake state. Their findings will be published in the June 8th online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
"We found that – for creative problems that you've already been working on – the passage of time is enough to find solutions," said Mednick. "However, for new problems, only REM sleep enhances creativity."
Mednick added that it appears REM sleep helps achieve such solutions by stimulating associative networks, allowing the brain to make new and useful associations between unrelated ideas. Importantly, the study showed that these improvements are not due to selective memory enhancements.
A critical issue in sleep and cognition is whether improvements in behavioral performance are the result of sleep-specific enhancement or simply reduction of interference – since experiences while awake have been shown to interfere with memory consolidation. The researchers controlled for such interference effects by comparing sleep periods to quiet rest periods without any verbal input.
While evidence for the role of sleep in creative problem-solving has been looked at by prior research, underlying mechanisms such as different stages of sleep had not been explored. Using a creativity task called a Remote Associates Test (RAT), study participants were shown multiple groups of three words (for example: cookie, heart, sixteen) and asked to find a fourth word that can be associated to all three words (sweet, in this instance). Participants were tested in the morning, and again in the afternoon, after either a nap with REM sleep, one without REM or a quiet rest period. The researchers manipulated various conditions of prior exposure to elements of the creative problem, and controlled for memory.
"Participants grouped by REM sleep, non-REM sleep and quiet rest were indistinguishable on measures of memory," said Cai. "Although the quiet rest and non-REM sleep groups received the same prior exposure to the task, they displayed no improvement on the RAT test. Strikingly, however, the REM sleep group improved by almost 40 percent over their morning performances."
The authors hypothesize that the formation of associative networks from previously unassociated information in the brain, leading to creative problem-solving, is facilitated by changes to neurotransmitter systems during REM sleep.
Additional contributors to the study include Sarnoff A. Mednick, University of Southern California, Department of Psychology; Elizabeth M. Harrison, UCSD Department of Psychology; and Jennifer Kanady, UCSD Department of Psychiatry and Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, Research Service.

Was the Supreme Court's Wal-Mart case a bellwether? Or an instruction manual?
Depending on how you count “big cases,” the Supreme Court has just finished off either a great (according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce) or spectacularly great (according to a new study by the Constitutional Accountability Center ) term for big business. The measure of success here isn't just the win-loss record of the Chamber of Commerce, although that's certainly part of the story. Nor is it news that—in keeping with a recent trend—the court is systematically closing the courthouse doors to everyday litigants, though that's a tale that always bears retelling. The reason the Roberts Court has proven to be Christmas in July for big business is this: Slowly but surely, the Supreme Court is giving corporate America a handbook on how to engage in misconduct. In case after case, it seems big companies are being given the playbook on how to win even bigger the next time.
Start with one of the most important cases of the term, the recently deceased class-action suit filed by a million and a half women employed by Wal-Mart. The headlines—including mine—contended that the import of the court's decision lay in the ways class-action suits would be severely limited in the future. But dig a little deeper. In their majority opinion on behalf of the five conservatives on the court, Justice Antonin Scalia found that Wal-Mart could not be held accountable for discrimination in pay and promotions because the plaintiffs lacked “convincing proof of a companywide discriminatory pay and promotion policy.” Then Scalia went one further and offered Wal-Mart, the largest private employer in the country, a virtual guidebook on how to discriminate better: Do it in bulk up and down the chain of command, and make certain to do it at every possible level. As SCOTUSblog's Lyle Denniston pointed out almost immediately after the decision came down:
For large companies in general, the ruling in Wal-Mart … offered a second message: the bigger the company, the more varied and decentralized its job practices, the less likely it will have to face a class-action claim. Only workers who have a truly common legal claim may sue as a group, the Court majority made clear—and, even that claim will require rigorous proof that every single worker suffered from exactly the same sort of bias. Sample statistics and anecdotes won't do.
The greatest impact of the Wal-Mart decision isn't the blow dealt to class-action suits. It's the guidance it provides employers: Immunize yourself from claims of gender discrimination with a written policy that says “we don't discriminate” and a system of decentralized decision-making. The decision doesn't discourage future corporate discrimination. It just makes it harder to identify and prove it.
The same is true for the court's remarkable 5-4 holding in AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion. In that decision, the court read a federal statute to mean that consumers may not participate in class action suits if their contract—in this case, with a cell phone company—contains an arbitration agreement (by which, I promise you, you are currently bound). In AT&T, a class of California plaintiffs tried to bundle together their claims alleging that AT&T had engaged in false advertising and fraud by charging sales tax on phones it had promoted as free. California law provided that the mandatory arbitration provision was not enforceable and that the parties should be allowed to litigate as a class. But the court—Scalia writing again—determined that the California rule was pre-empted by the Federal Arbitration Act. “It was important [for the court] to protect defendants, such as corporations, from the ‘in terrorem' effects of class actions, which pressure them into settlements,” writes Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC-Irvine School of Law. “ In fact, the Court went further and said that the Federal Arbitration Act requires that claims be arbitrated on an individual basis and that class arbitration is not allowed.”
Yes, the AT&T case will make class-action suits vastly less likely, as Justice Stephen Breyer pointed out in their dissent: “What rational lawyer would have signed on to represent the Concepcions in litigation for the possibility of fees stemming from a $30.22 claim? The realistic alternative to a class action is not 17 million individual suits, but zero individual suits, as only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30.” Even more important, however, the case provides corporate America with another useful tip on how to avoid costly litigation: If you haven't already done so, rush to lock your customers and /or employees into invisible mandatory arbitration agreements that will bar them from challenging your misconduct in a class-action suit. As Nan Aron at Alliance for Justice explained when the AT&T case first came down, the real winner here was not “justice”:
Corporations will now be able to decide on their own which civil rights and consumer protections they want to obey, knowing that there will be no effective means available to their victims to find redress. Even worse, not only has the radical conservative majority damaged the ability of consumers or employees to find justice, it has effectively removed any incentive for corporations to behave within the law in the first place. Why act lawfully if your victims are helpless, especially in cases like this when the harm to each individual is small but the potential for profit is huge?
Think Progress' Ian Millhiser put it even more starkly. After AT&T, they write, big corporations “need never worry about a class action again. They can simply tell all of their workers to sign away their rights or they're fired. Likewise, cell phone companies, banks, credit card companies, nursing homes—indeed, anyone who requires you to sign an agreement before they will do business with you—can completely immunize themselves from class actions simply by adding a few magic words to the agreement.” We may need a new metaphor. This is not merely closing the courthouse doors anymore. It's turning the civil justice system into a hostage situation.
Which brings us to the third case in this trifecta, a case that has gone largely unnoticed in the blur that is the end of the 2010 term: In yet another 5-4 decision last week, Janus Capital Group, Inc. v. First Derivative Traders, the court not only immunized big business from yet more awkward and messy litigation; it gave them an instruction manual on how best to lie to consumers. Millhiser again:
Securities and Exchange Commission regulations make it illegal to “make any untrue statement of a material fact … in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.” And according to a complaint filed by the New York Attorney General's office, an investment company named Janus did exactly that. Essentially, the complaint maintains, Janus promised its investors that it would prevent any new investors from engaging in a particular kind of price manipulation while secretly entering into agreements permitting that manipulation to occur.
In a 5-4 opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court found that the false and misleading statements made by Janus were not in fact “made” by Janus but by a second company Janus had set up, which acted—in Thomas' view—more like … a speechwriter. And, as a mere speechwriter, of course, it couldn't be held responsible for its statements.
Even though Janus Capital Management did indeed produce the false prospectuses, the court found that they were actually filed by a separate legal entity—the Janus Investment Fund. And even though the Janus Investment Fund is run by Janus Capital Management, Janus Capital Management is not on the hook for the lies. Wrote Thomas, “Even when a speechwriter drafts a speech, the content is entirely within the control of the person who delivers it. And it is the speaker who takes credit—or blame—for what is ultimately said.”
Don't even bother asking how huge financial companies will benefit from the holding in the case. It's as easy as setting up a dummy corporation to make your false statements for you. In the wake of the holding, William A. Birdthistle, an associate professor of law at Chicago-Kent College of Law, told Bloomberg columnist Susan Antilla to expect “corporations outside of the investment-management business to alter their legal structures to gain the same protection that funds now enjoy.” As they put it, “In Delaware, with 30 minutes and $50, you can create a legal entity.”
As the Boston Globe editorialized, the new rule “lets Janus and similar companies hide false information in a complicated organization chart [and] can only undermine public confidence in the mutual fund industry over time.” Ask yourself whether you really want the Supreme Court to be in the business of teaching corporate giants how better to deceive you about your investments. Yet Thomas, like Scalia in the AT&T case, was more worried about Janus, and its possible exposure to burdensome new lawsuits, than they were about the investors who were deceived. The purpose of civil litigation isn't solely to redress past wrongs. It's also to encourage better future conduct, particularly in situations where the parties have vastly unequal power. When you obliterate the very possibility of civil litigation, you are, by definition, helping big business screw over the little guy. But when you teach big business precisely how to screw over the little guy, and how to do it faster, cheaper, and without detection … well, that's not even an illusion of justice anymore. It's enabling.
A coalition of far-left student groups at the University of Virginia has issued a lengthy set of demands which describes Thomas Jefferson as “an emblem of white supremacy” and calls on officials at the taxpayer-funded school to set racial quotas for admissions and faculty.
The Minority Rights Coalition at the University of Virginia issued the set of 10 demands earlier this week to coincide with an event called the “March to Reclaim Our Grounds.”
“UVA's historical landscape must be balanced,” the list of demands announces. “The statue of Jefferson serves as an emblem of white supremacy, and should be re-contextualized with a plaque to include that history.”
The student coalition also wants to force all students the prestigious public school to submit to training about “white supremacy” in connection with Jefferson,
“All students, regardless of area of study, should have required education (either inside or outside the classroom) on white supremacy, colonization, and slavery as they directly relate to Thomas Jefferson, the University and the city of Charlottesville,” the set of demands says.
A third demand seeks a declaration that the expansive campus lawn become “a residential space.” Such a declaration is necessary, the protesting students say, to prevent people from carrying concealed guns and open flames.
A fourth demand relates to a donation the University of Virginia received 96 years ago. “Acknowledge the $1,000 gift to the University's Centennial Fund received from the KKK,” the demands say. “Re-invest this amount, adjusted for inflation, into existing UVa and Charlottesville multicultural organizations.”
After adjusting for inflation, $1,000 in 1921 is worth $12,883.47 in current dollars.
Still other demands from the Minority Rights Coalition include the creation of an affirmative action quota policy which would roughly double black student enrollment (from 6.4 percent to 12 percent) and increase the percentage of black faculty members dramatically.
The Minority Rights Coalition also wants to rename buildings currently named after “prominent white supremacists, eugenicists, or slaveholders” and to ban Richard Spencer — a University of Virginia alumnus — from campus
In addition to the Black Student Alliance, over a dozen other student groups have signed on to the set of demands. The other groups include the Latinx Student Association, the Native American Student Union, the Asian Student Union and, of course, a group called Feminism is for Everyone.
The “March to Reclaim Our Grounds” occurred on Monday. Several hundred students marched through the University of Virginia campus in response to last Saturday's “Unite the Right” rally at which a Nazi sympathizer allegedly killed a woman and injured 19 other people with their gray Dodge Challenger.
Jefferson founded the University of Virginia in 1819.
A University of Virginia spokesperson told The Daily Caller they are not sure how many statues honoring Jefferson appear on the school's campus.
The campus is designated as a UNESCO collegiate world heritage site.

Johnson spent more than $318,000 in August. Gary Johnson has the best ever haul
Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson had their best fundraising month ever in August, but the money remains a pittance compared with the tens of millions of dollars President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are raising.
Johnson's $356,406 last month largely came in the form of modest contributions from hundreds of individuals, new federal records show.
Story Continued Below
The former New Mexico governor, who initially sought the Republican Party's presidential nomination this year, also received $73,692 in public matching funds from a federal program both Obama and Romney have rejected.
Johnson spent more than $318,000 in August, primarily on advertising, travel and campaign advising services, federal disclosures indicate. They also owe more than $175,000 to several consultants.
They reported having $52,341 in their campaign account at the end of last month.
In a recent interview, Johnson pinned their presidential hopes on scoring a seat at presidential debates in October and the help of super PACs, which may raise and spend unlimited amounts of money. It would take about $50 million in campaign and super PAC money for them to win the presidency, Johnson said.
To date, significant super PAC support for Johnson has yet to materialize.
Johnson is on the presidential ballot in 47 states and the District of Columbia.

Why is Representative Adam Schiff continuing to push lies about President Trump and Russia despite their being zero evidence of any collusion between the two whatsoever?
Despite this, Schiff continues to push the “muh Russia” narrative harder than almost any member of Congress almost as if they have a reason to see the President of the United States of America shut down, for their own benefit.
It seems ironic that the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee is more concerned with perpetuating a lie, than seeing the completion of an investigation which affects all of America, doesn't it?
In fact Schiff went onto CNN just this past Sunday morning to underscore those same lies, with a permanent marker to try and draw attention to hypotheticals and conspiracy theories.
“To believe these are all isolated incidents and not connected to each other; it just doesn't make rational sense,” they said. “Now, can you prove beyond a reasonable doubt, will Mueller's question to answer, that the Russians communicated to the campaign the way they were going to deliver the help they offered, and the campaign accepted, was not by handing the emails directly over to the campaign but by publishing them.”
It seems sort of strange that Adam Schiff has all of this animosity towards the President of the United States of America, under the hidden guise of “Justice” when there are no answers whatsoever to any of these hypotheticals to suggest that any of this ever actually occurred to begin with.
<img src="https://media.8ch.net/file_store/073c0a615d58cf3205b4324a8b1dcb8efda4b66bbea2f9bf60dec2d6e2197bdc.jpg" style="max-height:640px;max-width:360px;">
What exactly is Adam Schiff hiding? What's they so concerned about protecting? Does Adam Schiff have interests that he's not disclosing to the public in seeing President Trump prevented from exposing more corruption? Could Schiff themselves directly be implicated in this corruption?
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here's what we know: CNN refused to out you as the fake e-mail leaker b/c it wants you to keep leaking lies and appearing on CNN shows. <a href="https://t.co/mFouamSAs6">https://t.co/mFouamSAs6</a></p>— Sean Davis (@seanmdav) <a href="https://twitter.com/seanmdav/status/939932187616477184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2017</a></blockquote>

There's more than ample reason to believe that Adam Schiff could have been the individual who was responsible for leaking Russia information to the press, and as of this time that's to be considered speculation, but it's still concerning to say the least.
We all know about the Fake News that CNN ran this past Friday, embarrassing itself eternally with the reports, which turned out to be entirely bogus and forced another embarrassing apology.
Could Adam Schiff be their source? They clearly appear on CNN quite often, and everytime perpetuates myth over fact.
The central debate in the CNN story was the date of an email which was allegedly sent to the Trump Campaign.
The email was leaked from within the House Intelligence Committee and surprisingly enough it was later reported by CNN, that the date was “September 4th, 2016”; a date convenient for a collusion narrative between Trump Jr. and WikiLeaks.
This information was false though. The real date on the actual email, was “September 14th, 2016”; just a day after Wikileaks published the content of their DNC leaks and a date that makes the entire CNN report a ‘nothingburger'.
<div style="width:100%;text-align:center;margin:0 auto;"><iframe width="360" height="202" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T_5mct8WArc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
The CNN report claimed that “two independent sources” originally leaked the contents of what they had seen on the email to their network, but CNN later said they never saw the email, until further on in the day.
Think about this carefully for a few moments, if you will.
Allegedly two “independent sources” both looked at an email, and both of those sources failed to read that email's wrong date which was reported by CNN? How is that much stupidity even possible?
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm seeing lots of tweets saying CNN should out the sources that misinformed <a href="https://twitter.com/mkraju?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MKRaju</a>.

Okay, I get that it's CNN, but the levels of incompetence here are stunning, and the fact they refuse to name these individuals or terminate them shows just how important it is.
So if you're following the white rabbit at all, or not, you'll know that it's alleged that Representative Adam Schiff may or may not be a potential leaker.
I'm not going to go into that any further, because I cannot prove speculation.
What I can prove is that CNN continues to run fake and misleading news and Adam Schiff regularly reporting on CNN perpetuating those lies.
It has been a topic of contention for several weeks that a counterintelligence sting operation has been going on within the Intelligence Community.
Endless false pieces of information, granted for other sources to the their leakers, intended to be captured by the media leakers, and delivered to their endless allies in media.
The stories are often times fake, and the leaks are real.
Representative Adam Schiff seems to be a likely candidate for these leaks, and many people will continue to believe this until proven otherwise.

Everybody loves those videos about unlikely animal friends, where a dog and a cat help each other steal food off of a table, or a monkey and a pig climb a tree, or a lion dances on a log with a warthog and a meerkat (though that might be a different kind of movie). Well, now we have a new duo of unlikely animal friends, except these unlikely animal friends happen to both be people: Conan O'Brien and former NBC head Jeff Zucker.
For those who don't keep up with recent TV history, Zucker is the guy who fired Conan when he, essentially, refused to move their Tonight Show back a timeslot to make room for The Jay Leno Show—a garbage program that everyone hated. Coco walked away with $32 million and eventually landed the Conan show on TBS. Zucker was eventually kicked out of NBC for turning it into a garbage network that everyone hates, and they have since taken over CNN—which is currently a news network that everyone tolerates, so they still have some work to do.

So it would stand to reason that there might be some Taylor Swift-style bad blood between Conan and Zucker, but according to The Hollywood Reporter, the pair recently managed to “stun onlookers” by “briefly and cordially” having a conversation during upfronts earlier this month. Apparently, Conan initiated this brief and cordial conversation, and when they returned to the stunned onlookers among their team “minutes later,” they gave them “a ‘life's too short' shrug.”
Of course, since Conan did take enough money from NBC to keep their pompadour orange and healthy for another century or two, burying the hatchet probably wasn't as hard as some people might think. $32 million and five years can make a lot of things pretty easy.
This past weekend, I participated in the Doors Open Winnipeg event by taking a tour of the former Vaughan Street Jail in Winnipeg. Doors Open is a free weekend-long event that takes place annually during the last weekend in May in cities across Canada, where historic buildings that are otherwise not accessible to the public open their doors to allow visitors to explore inside and take tours. It is a fantastic educational event and is a great way to learn about the history of the buildings and see some interesting architecture as well. In Winnipeg, the list of buildings included former banks, houses with historical significance, government buildings, a variety of cathedrals and churches, and of course, the Vaughan Street Jail.
In addition to touring the Vaughan Street Jail, I also checked out the Parish of Saint Luke Church in Osborne Village and the Manitoba Legislative Building, both of which were beautiful historic buildings and featured some amazing and detailed architecture. But this post will focus on my experience at the jail.
The Vaughan Street Jail was a jail built in 1881 that now sits vacant at 444 York Street in downtown Winnipeg, beside the Law Courts building. I have passed by this building many times but had never been inside until today. Along the exterior walls of the historic brick building, were old windows that were broken and had cracks along with rusty bars across them.
My mother and I arrived at the jail in the morning, about an hour after they had started to give tours. There was a line-up but it wasn't too long and we only had to wait around 10-15 minutes before another tour group was allowed inside. While waiting in line, we were entertained with actors and actores playing people who were formerly imprisoned at the jail and telling us about their stories and providing insights into the terrible living conditions at the jail.
The jail housed men, women and children (as young as five years old) who had committed a wide variety of crimes ranging from stealing an apple or a silver spoon, not going to school (for children), prostitution, having an argument with and not obeying one's husband (for women) to drunkenness, homosexuality, causing a public disturbance, theft/robbery, and murder. All of these people were housed together and many of them suffered from physical and/or mental illnesses.
Once inside, we climbed a narrow set of stairs to the second level. Our large tour group visited a few separate areas on this floor where four local volunteers dressed in old-fashioned clothing and acting as a former prisoner at the jail, told us the story about their life leading up to their incarceration and while living inside the jail, along with interesting facts about the jail itself. I was shocked and appalled to hear about how the women, men and children imprisoned there, were treated! It was so barbaric. They were all warehoused together in cells at the jail, where they were fed only bread and water and many of the prisoners were imprisoned for such minor “crimes.” The second level consisted of a few open areas that were separated by walls, where former prison cells had been located (they have since been removed). I could see the lines on the floor where the walls of the cells had been and the volunteers informed us that there were sometimes up to six people sharing one of these small cells!
The interior of the building was old, rundown and dirty. The windows were old and covered in dust and grime and the paint was peeling and chipping away from the walls.
After visiting the second floor, we made our way down to the basement of the jail, which was my favourite part of the tour. The area was cramped, damp (and it was tight to fit everybody from our 25-30 person or so tour group down there!) and dimly lit with white Christmas lights strung up along the pipes on the low ceiling. It felt like a dungeon and was eerie. The paint on the walls was seriously peeling off and chipping. We walked down a long and very narrow and dark hallway where there were original cells located along one side of the hallway, which was very cool and I had no idea these still existed in this building. The cells were so tiny and consisted of only a metal and very uncomfortable looking cot against one wall, a toilet and sink, cold cement floor, and iron barred door. There were no windows or natural light and I couldn't imagine what it must have been like for the prisoners who actually spent part of their lives down there! We were informed that it was typically the disobedient inmates who did not respect the prison rules who were housed down in the basement. I wandered into a few of the cells and it was quite creepy. The cell situated at the far end of the hallway was a larger one that had a small metal table in it and we were informed that this cell was where inmates about to be executed would spend their last night where they could “enjoy” their last meal (which could be requested) along with a more spacious cell before they were hanged the following day.
Also in the basement were two “lunatic” cells, where those with mental illnesses were housed for a night or two, which was believed would “cure” whatever ailed them. Inmates were chained and shackled to metal rods cemented into the floor. But it got worse… the prison guards would place small pieces of bread on the inmates' heads and body and the rats would come out at night to eat the bread and then nibble on the skin of the individuals! I was so disgusted and shocked to hear about such inhumane and barbaric treatment!
Next, we wandered over to an area of the basement where a few solitary confinement cells were located. They had large metal doors with only a small window at the top of the door and a food slot. The cells were completely empty and dark, with no cot or toilet, light source or windows. There were shackles laying on the cold cement floor of the cells, where inmates were chained to the ground during their time in solitary. Just trying to imagine spending time in a place like that was depressing in itself! I stepped inside of the cells and it definitely felt eerie.
After spending some time exploring the cells in the basement, we headed back up to the main level and our tour was complete.
Here are some more facts that I learned about the Vaughan Street Jail during my tour:
Various participants in the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 were jailed there.
The Vaughan Street Jail is the oldest building that is still standing in the city of Winnipeg.
Many local and national historical public figures spent time at this jail including the first juvenile court judge in Canada (Thomas Mayne Daly), the first warden of Manitoba (Samuel Bedson), the first public health nurse in Canada (Margaret Scott), the first serial killer of Manitoba (Earl Nelson), the Winnipeg General Strike Leader and advocate for women's rights (Helen Armstrong) and others.
A double hanging occurred at this jail on May 27, 1899.
A total of 15 men were executed by method of hanging at this jail between 1899 and 1928!
The Vaughan Street Jail served as a provincial jail until 1930 when the Headingley Jail opened. Following that, it was used as a remand centre and youth detention centre until 1984 when the building was closed.
Only one man, Ken Leishman, managed to escape from the jail in 1966 but was caught the next day.
When the jail was in operation, members of the public could pay money to see the “lunatics” and tour
Tours of this jail are only available to the public once a year during the Doors Open Winnipeg event, on the last weekend of May.
In total, the tour lasted around 45 minutes to an hour.
Touring this historic jail was such a fascinating experience and I enjoyed learning about the stories of the people who spent time there as well discovering a lot of interesting and shocking facts about the jail, the living conditions and the treatment of the inmates there. I had a great time exploring a new place locally in my own hometown!

Influx of receivers doesn't mean Titans turn into a three-WR offense
NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- With an influx of perimeter weapons who can run after the catch, the Titans are in better position to play balanced offense.
Titans coach Mike Mularkey wants camp to unfold to learn just what he's got.
But those around them believe, as I do, the Titans won't be changing a great deal from what they were in their turnaround 2016 campaign: A two-tight end base offense that calls on an extra blocker to help a run-first scheme and add a layer of protection for Marcus Mariota.
“Our offense is a run-first offense, I would say," Delanie Walker, the No. 1 tight end, said. "With the tight ends on the field we can run those packages and we can also spread out a tight end and be able to audible out into a pass.
“I think we're going to keep that two tight-end set. Even if our receivers come together and be a dominant group, we're still going to run two tight-end. It's going to be very hard to get away from that.”
The Titans ran the third-fewest three-wide receiver sets in the NFL last season.
Anthony Fasano was a dirty work hero as the on-the-line tight end, and they played a significant role in protecting Mariota, helping right tackle Jack Conklin have an Pro rookie season and left tackle Taylor Lewan make their first Pro Bowl.
Fasano left as a free agent for Miami.
The Titans will turn to rookie Jonnu Smith and veteran Phillip Supernaw in the role now, while third tackle Dennis Kelly could also get some snaps. They were the third tight end in jumbo sets a year ago.
“I don't think much is going to change from last year,” left tackle Taylor Lewan said.
A facelift for the receiving core will increase the big plays and produce more deep stuff for sure, they said. And that will serve to enhance the core of what the Titans are.
“We're a two-tight end, bread-and-butter power, we're those guys,” Lewan said. “And that's who we're going to stay. Ask the offensive line what do you want to run, and it's 'Beat the s--- out of them football.' We're not going to sit here and say, ‘Go into 11 personnel (with one back and one tight end).
“We want to run the ball and we want to run it hard, set up that play action and take a shot once in a while to really keep anybody honest.”
If Corey Davis and Taywan Taylor are what the Titans expect, and if a healthy Eric Decker is getting regular snaps, Tennessee will have its best group of wide receivers in some time and Mularkey and offensive coordinator Terry Robiskie will get to be more inventive with what's been dubbed their exotic smashmouth offense.
Walker and Lewan will happily run whatever is called.
But they are clearly all-in with the identity Mularkey and general manager Jon Robinson successfully established in their first year working together. The wide receiver overhaul can enhance it. I don't expect it will change it dramatically.
“The offensive isn't going to change,” Mularkey said. “It's going to be what people worry about with us, it's going to be multi-dimensional, multiple personnel. I've got to be influenced by what goes on out here (at camp) with these guys. A lot of what goes on on Sunday is what happens out here.
“It depends on who we think can get us the best opportunity to win and be the most threatening. Does that change some things? Maybe it changes the numbers. Until I see that, I can't predict anything right now.”
When the Titans are in three-wide, that inside receiver will be asked to help in the protection scheme before they head out. All the newcomers have been rated by the team as able and willing blockers.
Remember, though, just a year ago, the fundamental pledge was to protect Mariota. More targets out more quickly can help do that, but it's a different approach than consistently fortifying their protection.
“That's a part of us and what we do,” Robiskie said. “We've got a group of tight ends that we think are really, really good, a tight end coach in Arthur Smith that we think is outstanding.
“We will never expose those tackles. Anything we do, any discussion we have, any inkling that we are doing something that exposes our tackles or our linemen, we'll never do it. That's a very high standard. Very, very high…
“I think we're going to do what we do. We're always going to have a good mixture. But we're going to always consistently try to get in position, what gives us the opportunity to convert?”
Police investigating the fatal shooting of a man in their 50s in Bangor are understood to be linking the attack to the drugs trade.
Another man in their 40s was also shot and injured and is in a stable condition in hospital.
Police said they received reports of the shooting at Hazelbrook Avenue off the Clandeboye Road at about 1220 BST.
Chief Superintendent Nigel Grimshaw said that both victims were known to police. One man has been arrested.
They were held by police in Ormeau Avenue in Belfast.
The dead man's name has not yet been released.
It is understood the two victims did not live in the house where they were shot.
"Whatever the circumstances, an individual from somebody's family has died today," Chief Superintendent Grimshaw told a press conference.
"That is a tragedy for Bangor. It's not something that the community are used to, nor is it something that I want them to become used to.
"I want people to be assured that we are out there, they will see us. They should not be overly concerned in terms of this kind of incident happening.
"A full and complicated investigation will be taken forward."
If we take the “It's what Muslims do, and how they interpret their texts” axiom seriously, then there would be no grounds to declare that a Muslim who believes in a pantheon of gods is unfaithful to the teachings of Islam. After all, the Quran, speaking with the Divine Voice, often uses the royal "We" when addressing Muslims. Would this belief in multiple gods also be ‘Islam'? Would these polytheistic Muslims have “just as much legitimacy as anyone else” because they are drawing on the same texts as other Muslims?
Can we extend the axiom of “There is no X, there is only what followers of X do and how they interpret their texts” beyond Islam? If a scientist claims, “Eugenics is not a valid application of the principles of science, and is unscientific,” should they expect to be told that the eugenicists were “just as legitimate as anyone else” because they are following the same body of texts? Were not the eugenicists “serious” and “assiduous” in their science, at least in their own eyes? Did they not speak the language of science, and base themselves on Darwin?
In fact, no one acknowledges that all interpretations of their own system of ultimate meaning are equally authentic or faithful, whether this system is scientism, communism, post-modernism, or any other metaphysical commitment including religion. It is arbitrary to present the Islamic interpretative tradition as an unrestricted free-for-all where nothing is assessed on objective rational or moral criteria, in which every last impulse or assertion is equal to all other responses and can never be subjected to judgment or ranking.
* * *
What other Muslims have been arguing from the start is that ISIS does not take the texts seriously.
The Quran is a single volume, roughly the length of the New Testament. It is a complex and nuanced text that deals with legal, moral, and metaphysical questions in a subtle and multifaceted way. Then there are the hadīth, or records of sayings and doings of the Prophet Muhammad, which run into dozens of volumes spanning literally hundreds of thousands of texts, each on average a few sentences long. Then there is the juridical and theological literature about the Quran and the hadīth, which consists of thousands of works written throughout Islamic history.
Does ISIS cite “texts”? Yes, though its main method is to cite individual ḥadīth that support its positions. But remember: The ḥadīth consist of hundreds of thousands of discrete items that range from faithfully transmitted teachings to outright fabrications attributed to the Prophet, and every gradation in between.
Over the centuries, jurists and theologians of every stripe, Sunni and Shiite, have devised rational, systematic methods for sifting through ḥadīth, which are often difficult to understand or seem to say contrary things about the same questions. They have ranked and classified these texts according to how reliable they are, and have used them accordingly in law and theology. But ISIS does not do this. Its members search for text snippets that support their argument, claim that these fragments are reliable even if they are not, and disregard all contrary evidence—not to mention Islam's vast and varied intellectual and legal tradition. Their so-called “prophetic methodology” is nothing more than cherry-picking what they like and ignoring what they do not.
Last week, 7 year-old entrepreneur Julie Murphy (with VP Mom assisting) opened a lemonade booth at a local arts fair in usually laid-back Portland, Oregon, according to MSNBC. Unfortunately, it was not long before a county health inspector stepped up to the booth, not for a refreshing sip of the Kool-Aid concoction, but to demand to see Julie's restaurant license. When Julie and their mother admitted to the inspector they did not have a license, they threatened them with a $500 fine if they did not shut down their illicit lemonade stand immediately.
First there was the Boston Tea Party (the original one, not the current one). Then Prohibition. Now, there is the Portland Lemonade Revolt. Yes, like their forbearers, this modern American citizen truly resents government bureaucrats tampering with their God given right to sell and drink their preferred legal beverage. Now, after county inspectors shut down a little girl's lemonade stand , some Portlanders are up in arms.
The 2010 version of the Sons (and Daughters) of Liberty stepped in at this point forming a crowd around the stand and urging Julie and their mom to stand strong. Sadly, the showdown concluded when a crying Julie packed up the stand and left. My children, the battle was lost, but the war was won. Multnoma County chairperson Jeff Cogen has apologized to Julie. They concede that selling lemonade is, "... a classic, iconic American kid thing to do," according to the local paper, The Oregonian. Julie has accepted the apology, received widespread support, and turned a tidy profit as well. How American.
Permits are issued, much to the dismay of some, at all levels of government, including federal, state and local. Health Department permits are usually required for businesses involve in the preparation and/or sale of food, among other types of businesses. This would apply here of course, if one can call a Kool-Aid based drink, "food." That will remain open for discussion.
But the defenders of the iconic American childhood are not so easily mollified. The Oregonian reports that one vendor at the arts fair is planning the Lemonade Revolt for the next time the fair is held, later in August. Imagine county inspectors surrounded by a crowd of angry vendors, all selling lemonade without a license. Talk about civil disobedience.

A year or two ago a college kid I know started dating a film student. The first time they had sex, very early into the relationship, they asked if they could come on their face. Ewww! I wasn't really surprised at this anecdote, since boys their age have, realistically, been watching internet porn since they were nine years old; that's probably how this kid got interested in becoming a "filmmaker" in the first place, so I advised them to do away with boys their age; just like the younger generation apparently doesn't believe sex transpired unless they documented it on an easy memory stick-able format, "they don't think sex is 'good' unless it's somehow fetish-y," explains one of the younger Jezebels. But then! The other day a friend of mine brought home some dude from a holiday party and the same thing happened, only they used the terms "shoot" and "load" and this time everyone involved was thirty.
And just for fun, I'm going to throw in the time a friend of mine went on a first date with a guy they met on the Muslim equivalent of JDate — and after a romantic night of dinner, wine, Ella Fitzgerald and Scrabble, they presented them with a "safety word"...
They went along with it. "I really liked him!" It involved spanking with a special S&M belt and calling them their dirty little slut and other highly inventive nicknames to indicate that they were "dominating" them ("I do that to keep from getting too close to women," the dude, a psychiatrist, later explained. Nice job!)
Anyway, I know I should probably find some news to peg this to, like a story a few British Cosmos back about how the proliferation of porn is forcing women to do "things they don't want to do" in bed, but what's better than my own anecdotal evidence? We all know it is true: porn is doing to sex what scotch is doing to your liver. And I mean, it makes sense! It's so easy to get, and so perfect for the beaten-down and emotionally unavailable! But seriously, it has to stop. That's all.
(Frederick, MD) – …at least for the time being.
Update I: A sixth state?
Update II: Beer Advocate reports that Flying Dog has notified an additional seven states that they are halting distribution there. The total is now at thirteen.
Here's the new list:
Alaska
Washington
Oregon
Idaho
Montana
New Mexico
Arizona
Nebraska
Iowa
Missouri
Kansas
Louisiana
Arkansas
Original Article:
Flying Dog Brewery General Partner and CEO, Jim Caruso, confirmed today that the company is halting distribution in five states: Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Arkansas and Louisiana. Caruso said that they will re-consider those markets this coming fall.
In a letter to distribution partners, Caruso writes:
As local demand for Flying Dog beers continues to soar, we are concentrating our distribution in our home markets and Flying Dog beers will not be available in your territory for some unknown period of time.
This is no doubt disappointing news, but it is a necessary decision and consistent with the new age of craft beer and the focus on local markets.
Author and beer industry expert, Andy Crouch, sums it up very well in a recent [Beer Advocate] article titled, “The Good Old Days of Craft Beer.” According to Andy, “consumers should appreciate losing a few brands. Dedication to local markets will define the next generation of craft beer, resulting in lower shipping costs, fresher beer, more direct attention from breweries and their staff, and deeper, stronger distributor relationships. So while disappointment is understandable, craft beer will be better for it.”
I cannot thank you enough for your support over the years and all of us at Flying Dog wish you continued success in your local market.
Flying Dog is among the fastest growing regional breweries in the country. Having grown 40% to nearly 70,000 barrels produced in 2010, due in large part to the launch of its controversial Raging Bitch, the brewery is struggling to meet high demand in some of its markets.
Flying Dog isn't alone in having to re-evaluate its distribution. Dogfish Head, Avery Brewing, Great Divide and others have contracted the number of markets that they serve in recent months. With distribution in 45 states and 20 countries prior to this contraction, the move seemed inevitable.
That said, there are states farther west than these five that are still being served so it isn't all about meeting the demand of local markets.
Glazer's Distributing handles the company's portfolio in some (if not all?) of the markets listed here.
With Missouri being the new hotbed of activity for regional (and micro) craft breweries, the pendulum is due to swing the other way and knock out a few breweries. The “Show Me State” is becoming an increasingly competitive battleground in which to compete with new 2011 entrants like Deschutes, Stone, Firestone Walker and Green Flash. One retailer noted that Flying Dog has been one of their slowest movers.
Clement Grenier has extended their deal with Ligue 1 club Lyon for a further two years, keeping them under contract at the Stade Gerland until 2018.
The France international was plagued by groin and thigh troubles last term as Lyon ultimately came up short in their bid to challenge Paris Saint-Germain for the title.
Despite being absent from late August until mid-April this year, the 24-year-old playmaker remains one of Lyon's key figures.
Grenier - a Lyon youth product - posted on Twitter on Thursday: "It is done!!!! 2 years more at OL. I am proud to continue the adventure and soon set foot again on the pitch of the big stadium. #TeamOL."
A Coupe de France and Trophee des Champions winner with Lyon, Grenier has been linked with the likes of Arsenal and Newcastle United in recent seasons.
The great room fireplace, which visually anchors the space into the curve of the canyon, is once again stainless steel with pale columns of brick on either side. Shamshiri had the pair of asymmetrical built-in sofas that once flanked the hearth recreated to Schindler's specifications: narrow at one end so you can lean forward to chat with others, wider toward the ­other end and therefore perfect for a nap. Above, attached to the ceiling, is a copy of Schindler's trellis that tracks the radiant lines of the architecture. The James Bond-like bar and pull-out dining table, with chairs that slide slyly beneath, have been remade as well. The harmony of the furnishings evoke the best of Wright's organic interiors, with less structure and more comfort, in keeping with Schindler's principles.
From there, Shamshiri strove to improve on the original. To make the flow more organic, and because food culture is now such a part of California living, they broke through the far end of the galley kitchen to connect it to the den behind, adding a Paul McCobb wine rack that looks as though it has always been there. The changes aren't major, but they're symbolically significant, proving that the work of great Modernist architects can be made contemporary without diluting their éclat.
Having come from a close, globe-trotting clan — their Iranian father and Roman mother split their time between Iran and Italy — Shamshiri regards family life as a cacophonous work in progress; they had no intention of living in a museum. “I would often say to myself, What would Schindler do if they were alive?” they say. “He updated houses all the time. They didn't think it was set in stone.”

China is the biggest threat to the world.
That may sound melodramatic, what with ISIL and North Korea, both vying for the brutality and human rights violations crown – BUT, the real culprit in destabilizing the world is most assuredly China — and unfortunately I can prove it.
Consider North Korea first, without Chinese rocket motors and technical assistance, that country would NOT be building nukes and attempting to build ICBM's. Why is that?
North Korea's main source of income, support, political cover, and military aid – for decades – has been the Chinese. They could have halted this program any time they wanted.
If intent is on your mind, consider this, after promising to restrain the NK nuke program over and over again, the Chinese doubled the coal shipments they were buying from NK — doubling Kim's foreign cash supply.
Trump appears to have temporarily halted this coal buying binge JUST in the last month, but the intent is still clear and has been for years.
China LIKES using Kim as a foil, and purposely lured them into this corner, so the Chinese could bargain away a piece of the NK nuke program — as a trade to block THAAD.
This failed and Trump ordered it installed this month — meaning the NK problem will blow up soon without serious change. The Chinese never give up.
The really scary thing is; the Chinese program of purge at home — and intimidation abroad — isn't about hegemony or ego and pride. It's about food.
The Chinese need protein, cannot afford it, and so they are stealing the world's fish supply to fill the gap between their protein demands and their supply.
How are the Chinese over fishing the world's oceans and literally starving the North Koreans to death at the same time? With a huge fleet of commercial fishing vessels spread out every corner of the ocean.
That's right, the Chinese OWN all the fishing rights for NK waters and take every fish out of them that the NK are entitled too.
The Chinese also attempted to buy and/or take over the entire fishing concession of the Bahamas' with a similar trick — and are also fishing out all of Africa's fish.
China has a 1.7 billion person population and a communist government. This is a clash of reality that has no eventual reconciliation because communism does not work efficiently enough to handle a massive strain like that.
Under Deng, China's only progressive leader, the Chinese turned away from communism, embraced a capitalist model for the economy (not politically) and had economic growth rates strong enough to keep China from being a threat to the rest of the world.
Now, under Xi, it's nothing more than a dictatorship, and now, as a result — they are going to get dictatorship like growth rates.
That means trouble for everybody else in the world.
This excerpt below from Peter Neil describes just how bad the problem is, and points to a world with oceans picked clean of fish, and the world's main eco-system destroyed. Not in 50 or 100 years, but in this decade if something doesn't change.
By Peter Neill Director, World Ocean Observatory With regard to the ocean, particularly to fisheries, China is the largest consumer, producer, and exporter of every species caught by some 3,400 industrial fishing vessels harvesting the waters of over 90 coastal nations and the deep ocean. According to a 2016 report by Mongabay.com, an excellent online conservation and environmental news service, China's annual catch is estimated at some 15 million tons, making it the world's top fishing nation twice over. The result has also been colossal: a 50% reduction in its own domestic fish stocks, a 600% rise in per capita seafood demand, and a global fleet that is 2 to 3 times larger than what the entire global ocean is estimated to sustainability support. Fish catches are presumably reported to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), but the statistics are very unreliable as a result of under-reporting, indifference to treaty quotas, illegal species catch, and stocks caught outside national jurisdictions. This lack of or misrepresentation of information is becoming more clear; the European Union estimates that the actual Chinese catches may be over twelve times what is reported through official channels and is dominating and decimating supply particularly in developing nations in West Africa where there is no domestic fleet to compete. In some instances, North Korea for example, China has acquired exclusive rights to all fishing within that nation's exclusive economic zone.
Communist ideology is broken, it always goes amuck eventually, and when it does, it always creates dictators — like Xi — and these authoritarian regimes then become the main threat to stability, prosperity, and the welfare of the world's citizens.
Believe it or not, the solution to the NK nuke program, and the world's ocean crisis, is a strong two party system inside a Chinese Democracy.
In other words, we don't need a war with China to stop these problems from growing, we just need the Chinese people to demand a change, a right to speak freely, to make their own decisions, and to have the option of voting for a second party within their political system

It's taken a little longer than expected, but Juan Iturbe is finally starting to realise their enormous potential that led them to being dubbed ‘the new Lionel Messi' only a few years ago. Of course, when any big talent emerges from Argentina, they are instantly dubbed and hyped up to be the next Maradona or the next Riquelme
Who is Juan Iturbe?
Iturbe started their career with Paraguayan giants Cerro Porteno at the tender age of 16 back in 2008. Porto, as always on the hunt for young South American talent, snapped them up in 2010 and they were expected to follow in the footsteps of so many South Americans before them such as Falcao and Lucho Gonzalez in using Porto as a stepping stone in Europe, before inevitably moving on for big money to one of Europe's elite. Their career had stalled however in Portugal, and after a number of years on the periphery of the first team, hope was beginning to fade for the young Argentine on whether they could actually cut it in Europe. Fortunately, they have found a new lease of life in Verona, where their form has won them admiring glances across the peninsula from the leagues big boys. Verona, a town famous for the setting of Shakespeare's epic tale – Romeo and Juliet – can bear witness to hopefully another romantic tale, this time in football form, with the rise of Juan Iturbe.
Born in Argentina, Iturbe actually grew up in Paraguay, and if it wasn't for a falling out with club and national officials, Iturbe could very much be representing the Paraguayan national team at the moment (he has already represented the Paraguayan under 17's and 20's). Iturbe had a dream debut for Cerro Porteno, when they scored less than a minute upon entering the pitch as a substitute when they were just 16 years old in a Copa Libertadores match against Chilean giants Colo Colo. That stunning introduction to top flight football inevitably led to Iturbe being pushed into the spotlight and clubs all around the world vying for their signature.
Porto duly snapped them up as soon as they turned eighteen, as many saw this as a smart move considering the success South American players have had at the club in recent years. A move to Portugal was seen as the ideal step in their career at this stage, as they could hone their talents in one of Europe's less rigorous leagues and still get a chance to showcase their talents in Europe's elite competition. The dream plan however began to unravel throughout their stint there, as injuries, form and poor attitude led the former wonderkid to only make 7 first appearances at the Dragao, without registering a goal or an assist. A loan to Argentinian side River Plate in early 2013 however was the beginning of an upswing in form for Iturbe, as they were an ever-present contributing goals and assists, leading the Argentinian giants to second place in the Clausara.
This sort of form led to Verona taking a chance on them on loan, and they have duly been rewarded for their faith in the youngster. Having debuted in a small cameo off the bench against Juventus, Iturbe made their full debut against Livorno on September 29. It was here Iturbe demonstrated one of their main weapons in their arsenal, netting a splendid free kick to open the scoring. Further goals against Bologna, Fiorentina and two in their last two matches against Lazio and Udinese have meant that Iturbe's record is at a healthy 5 goals in 15 games so far this season from the wing. Their cohesion with Jorginho and fellow newcomer Luca Toni has been key to Hellas Verona's European push, and has catapulted them above traditional giants Inter and Milan. Their form has been so good that they have been linked with moves to Roma and Liverpool in the January transfer window, but you feel he'd be best suited to finish the season in Verona, where they are a regular starter and fan favourite. Their agent – Gustavo Mascardi – may have a different idea as they have recently said they are open to a move to Roma:
“I want to make it clear that Iturbe has played for both Porto and Verona this term, so they cannot leave Verona for a different club in January,” pointed out agent Gustavo Mascardi on TMW.
“His experience at Porto is over and they have absolutely no intention of returning. We'll make sure Verona will take up their option, either with the support of a big club or a financial fund. It won't be a problem.”
“Roma? At the moment there is nothing concrete, but I'd be a liar if I denied Roma would be a good destination.”
Still only 20 years old, it is crucial at this stage of their career that Iturbe plays regular football. After revitalizing their career in Europe, it would be dangerous for them to fall into another trap and make another ill-advised move. If Iturbe continues this form to the end of the season, it will be the Real Madrid's and Barcelona's that will come for them in June instead of the Roma's and Liverpool's. Who knows, their form could lead them to being called-up for Argentina's World Cup squad in June.
Juan Iturbe featured in our list of 100 Best Young Players to Watch-out for in 2014. They were at #3 in our list of forwards/wingers. See the entire list here.
Style, strengths and weaknesses
It's pretty obvious to see why Iturbe has been likened to Lionel Messi. Boasting a low sense of gravity, dangerous running with the ball at speed, and always looking for an opportunity to shoot, the Argentine's talent is never in doubt. Primarily left footed, that is their main weapon as they are able to rifle shots from distance with power and venom (a trait they showed against Fiorentina with a 35 yard rocket into the top left corner), but their lack of using their right foot hinders them on occasion. Iturbe also always has an eye for the spectacular, and while this may look amazing, sometimes they may miss an opportunity for the simpler, more effective pass.  They are still young enough to iron out these deficiencies, and you could also put it down to youthful exuberance, but if they want to be an elite player then they must learn soon.
Like Messi, Iturbe loves to pick up the ball from deep and drive at the defence with their incredible speed and turn of pace, coupled with their brilliant close control, it makes for thrilling viewing for the audience. Iturbe is also earning a reputation as a free kick specialist, after netting goals from set pieces against Lazio and Livorno so far this season. Iturbe generates so much power and swing from their left boot, and it has left many a goalkeeper helpless so far this season.
One of Iturbe's tendencies is always to cut in from the right onto their more favoured trusty left boot. When they do get a chance to shoot with their left they are extremely dangerous, however it comes a tad predictable when they constantly do it. If they add a bit more variety to their game and goes on the outside of their marker more to keep the team guessing, they will become a much more unpredictable opponent and thus be harder to stop.
Not the tallest player (he stands at 1.69m tall); it is clear that they are not the strongest in the air and would rather play with the ball on the ground. One of Iturbe's main weaknesses is their selfishness and need to do everything on their own. Their coach Andrea Mandorlini called them out recently after a match against Catania in which they drew 0-0. Iturbe chose to go for goal when there was a clear goal in the offing if they chose to pass to Luca Toni instead: “Iturbe has incredible quality, but they must learn to play with the team more” Mandorlini stated.
Again, these sorts of things will disappear with experience and maturity you'd hope, but there is still a large scope for improvement in Iturbe. Iturbe must be able to show they are willing to listen and learn from their teammates and coaches, and there should be nothing to stop them from fulfilling their large potential if that happens.
Expert talk
“A combination of injury and not taking their (admittedly limited) opportunities have made Juan Manuel Iturbe's time at Porto a frustrating one so far – the next twelve months will be key.” – Ben Shave (PortuGOAL)
“Iturbe was singing in the rain,” wrote Diego Costa in La Repubblica. “But if Gene Kelly danced while they did that, then Iturbe made the opposing defence do it instead.”
Not everything comes naturally to Juan Iturbe. Verona's Argentinian playmaker has a way of making things look so straightforward on the pitch, bewitching their opponents with the simplest of touches or flicks. Since joining the club on loan from Porto in the summer, they have started three Serie A games and twice been named as Gazzettadello Sport's man of the match. Already they have two goals and an assist to their name.– Paolo Bandini (The Guardian)

19 year old girl, member of OWS, goes missing (updated 9/12)
Via the New York Daily News
New Yorker Stevie Bates, 19, who had been traveling cross-country with Occupy Wall Street friends to an Occupy event, stopped at a layover in Pittsburgh on April 27th on the way home to New York.
They haven't been seen since.
Bates was last observed boarding the bus in Pittsburgh bound for arrival in NY on April 28. Them mother Vivian last spoke to them on the phone when they were at the Greyhound station in Pittsburgh at 7:52 pm. They told their mother that when they got back they intended to stay with friends in Brooklyn but would be home later in the day. They never arrived.
Bates, a 19-year-old former cheerleader at the Bronx High School of Science, has shoulder-length blond dreadlocks, weighs 120 pounds and is 5'6″ tall. They have a nose piercing and a belly piercing.
The family filed a missing person's report with the City of Yonkers Police Department on May 9, according to Eugene Marron, a police dispatcher for the Yonkers Communications Department. Jones and Bates, who live in Yonkers, have received kernels of information in the days since Stevie disappeared. Police in Pittsburgh contacted Vivian on Friday with information that Stevie was captured on video boarding a bus in that city on April 27 during a layover, Vivian said, apparently at about the same Vivian last spoke to their daughter.
Vivian described their daughter as a homebody, incredibly outgoing, and quick to make friends. They rejected the idea that Stevie may have run away because of a family grievance. ”We were good, good friends,” Vivian said. “She would never do that.”
Stevie was heavily involved in the Occupy Wall Street movement, living in a tent in Zuccotti Park from September of last year until the camp was raided in November, Vivian said. They attended Hunter College last year but didn't register for this semester and was applying to colleges for the fall. They were interested in studying architecture. “In fact they have a couple of applications at home that are waiting for her,” Vivian said
The family purchased a new home in Yonkers on March 1 and was redoing the floors of the house in early April. Stevie was supposed to stay with friends in Brooklyn for a few days while the house was touched up. A week later, on April 19, Vivian said they got a call from Stevie from Virginia, saying they had gone on a road trip to Northern California with three friends they knew from Occupy Wall Street. Stevie lost their cell phone along the way so Vivian kept in contact through a friend's phone their daughter was traveling with.
Around April 23, Stevie told their mother their car broke down in North Carolina and they would be taking a bus to Arkansas. On April 26, Stevie had resolved to come home and boarded a Greyhound bus from Hot Springs, Ark. that was scheduled to arrive in New York City on April 28 at 5:40 a.m., Vivian said.
Vivian said they have been in contact with the Pittsburgh Police Department, speaking with a Det. Colleen Brust. On Saturday, Brust, who works in the missing person's bureau, could not be reached for comment, though a Det. Bryan Sellers, who deals with sexual assault cases, said the missing person's report involving Stevie Bates is in the Pittsburgh police system.
On Wednesday, Vivian went to Zuccotti Park, armed with a picture of Stevie to see if anyone knew of them whereabouts.
“My daughter is missing 14 days now,”Vivian said on Friday. “And this is unlike them not to at least be somewhere where I can find them or where their friends know where they are. I don't know what to think. I haven't heard anything.”
For any information on the whereabouts of Stevie Bates, please contact Vivian Bates at 646-345-3410.
Update: We've received information that an Occupier in NYC saw Stevie at Occupy Union Square this weekend. We will keep you updated as info becomes available but that is a positive sign.
Update: We want to thank everyone who has been offering to help and has reblogged or retweeted this information. As of this time, 11 pm EST any report of a sighting is not confirmed. Please continue to spread the word and to help look for Stevie.
Again, Stevie's mother reports that they had been in regular contact with their daughter, that Stevie borrowed a phone to stay in contact with them This is not like them While there was an earlier report of a sighting, we cannot confirm that at this time. We are asking people in PA, NY and NJ to be especially mindful. This is 17 days. Please help find them If you have any information, please call the above number, the Yonkers police or you can leave a comment here and it will be passed on.
Update: Here is a video of local TV station in Pittsburgh putting the word out.
Again, Stevie was last known to have spoken with their mother on April 27th at 7:52 pm ET while in Pittsburgh on a Greyhound bus layover stop – Stevie was expected to board the bus again as it headed for Port Authority in New York to arrive at 5:40 am that morning. It is not known whether or not they made it there. The bus schedule indicates that there were two other scheduled stops along the bus route that Stevie might have traveled – one in Slippery Rock, PA at 10:50 pm for 15 mins, and a stop in Philadelphia at 3:20 am for 20 mins. If you are in those areas, it would also be helpful to spread the word about Stevie Bates.

Update 5/26: It has been confirmed that Stevie did in fact arrive in NYC on April 28th at 8:51 am. So they made it to New York, and isn't missing from PA. There have been other reported sightings which are being followed but as yet none has panned out. They had left their Occupy friends and was traveling alone to a friend's house. We will let you know as information becomes available. Please keep spreading the word until we can bring Stevie safely home.
Here is video of Stevie reportedly about 2 weeks before they went missing:
Update 9/12:
Stevie will be profiled on the Ricki Lake show today with the above video. Hopefully, this will bring some answers and help find them

At the Senate GOP leadership's press conference on Tuesday, after Sen. Arlen Specter switched from the Republicans to the Democrats, Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) made a very interesting statement in their capacity as chairperson of the National Republican Senatorial Committee:
“I will tell you that in 2010 we are working very hard to make sure that we have the kind of candidates across the country on a national scale,” said Cornyn, “that will allow the Republican Party to regain our status as a national party, and run competitive races in blue states, and purple states, and in red states.”
So was Cornyn saying that the GOP is not right now a national party? I asked NRSC press secretary Amber Wilkerson for comment, and they pointed me in the direction of something Cornyn said at CPAC earlier this year, about the need to be a big tent that can appeal to voters across the country.Here's the relevant portion of Cornyn's remarks:
Now, not all of these candidates are going to be as conservative as I am on each and every issue, it's critical that we get candidates that will fit their states and who can get elected. But I don't think there's any contradiction between being principled and pragmatic. As I said, I'm one of — I'm proud to be the fourth most conservative Republican in the United States Senate. Back in Texas, we call that mainstream. But I have to tell you, I would rather have a Republican who votes with me 80 percent of the time than a liberal Democrat who will vote with me zero percent of the time. You can sign me up on each and every occasion to support that Republican for election and to oppose that Democrat. Now I understand that, occasionally, we get frustrated by the way some of my colleagues vote — I do to. But a circular firing squad is no solution to the problems our party finds itself to in right now. … So to be a national party we have to put blue and purple states into play. We must be a national party and we must run candidates that can win in every region of the country.
Cornyn's message on what it means to be a national party here seems pretty clear. They were telling this crowd of right-wing activists that the party can't be too ideologically exclusive, and part of politics is to build a broad enough coalition to win.
I spoke to Prof. Larry Sabato about Cornyn's remarks on Tuesday. “Look, this is the guy that tried to get Toomey to recognize reality and jump out of the primary in Pennsylvania,” said Sabato. “And Cornyn is as conservative as you can find. So Cornyn gets it, and their leadership gets it. But they're afraid of their own base. They're afraid of losing nominations and primaries and conventions, and that's what it's all about.”
Sabato said that technically the GOP is still a national party — but this is simply because the legal structures in this country have institutionalized the two-party system. “The legal system, or the legal structure, can't make a party competitive,” said Sabato. “Only a party can make itself competitive. And right now the Republicans don't have the will to do it. You know, some part of the Republican Party doesn't get it at all. Another part gets it, but is afraid to do anything. And a small portion gets it and wants to do something, but doesn't have the support to enact the changes needed.”
So can it be said that the GOP is no longer a true national party? “I would put it this way: They're doing a very poor imitation of a national party,” said Sabato. “That's how I would put it. In two elections, they have proven to be essentially a regional party with isolated geographic support in three places: The south, rural Midwestern states, and part of the Rocky Mountain states.”
YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar said on Friday a visiting U.S. official would not be allowed to go to a region where violence has triggered an exodus of nearly 400,000 Rohingya Muslims that the United Nations has branded a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing”.
The Rohingya have fled from western Rakhine state to neighboring Bangladesh to escape a military offensive that has raised questions about Myanmar's transition to civilian rule under the leadership of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Patrick Murphy will voice Washington's concerns about the Rohingya and press for greater access to the conflict area for humanitarian workers, the State Department said.
Myanmar officials said they would meet government leaders in the capital, Naypyitaw, and attend an address to the nation by Suu Kyi on Tuesday.
They would also visit Sittwe, the state capital, and meet the governor of Rakhine, the state government secretary, Tin Maung Swe, told Reuters, but the north of the state, where the conflict erupted on Aug. 25 would be off limits.
“Not allowed,” Tin Maung Swe said, when asked if Murphy would be going to Maungdaw district, at the heart of the strife that began when Rohingya insurgents attacked police posts and an army camp, killing a dozen people.
While nearly 400,000 refugees have poured across the border into Bangladesh, fears have also been growing of a humanitarian crisis on the Myanmar side, but access for aid workers and reporters has been severely restricted.
Myanmar insisted on Friday it was not barring aid workers but a government spokesperson said authorities on the ground might have concerns over security.
Right monitors and fleeing Rohingya say the army and Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes have mounted a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the Muslim population.
A Reuters photographer on the Bangladesh side of the border said they could see huge banks of dark smoke billowing up over Myanmar territory on Friday, while international aid organizations said the refugees kept coming.
“There's really no sign that this flow of people is going to dry up,” Chris Lom of the International Organisation for Migration, said from the Bangladeshi border district of Cox's Bazar.
“There are still, we believe, thousands of people waiting to take boats across to Cox's Bazar.”
‘SCORCHED EARTH'
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the U.N. Security Council have urged Myanmar to end the violence, which they said was best described as ethnic cleansing.

Myanmar rejects the accusations, saying its security forces are carrying out clearance operations to defend against the insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which claimed responsibility for the Aug. 25 attacks and similar, though smaller, attacks in October.
Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said on Friday that while Moscow was concerned “we cannot discard the fact that it was triggered by terrorist activities.”
“We're talking to the Myanmar government, of course,” they told reporters. “We are concerned with what is happening. ... We are looking forward to an early cessation of the violence and to elevating the humanitarian situation of the population.”
The government has declared Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army a terrorist organization and accused it of setting the fires and attacking civilians.
Ethnic cleansing is not recognized as a separate crime under international law but allegations of ethnic cleansing as part of wider, systematic human rights violations have been heard in international courts.
Rights group Amnesty International said evidence pointed to a “mass-scale scorched-earth campaign” across the north of Rakhine that was unmistakably ethnic cleansing.
“The evidence is irrefutable – the Myanmar security forces are setting northern Rakhine state ablaze in a targeted campaign to push the Rohingya people out of Myanmar,” said Tirana Hassan, the group's crisis response director.
The group said it had detected 80 big fires in Rohingya areas since Aug. 25. While the extent of damage could not be verified, due to access restrictions by the government, “they are likely to have burned down whole villages”.
It said it also had credible reports of Rohingya militants burning the homes of ethnic Rakhine and other minorities. About 30,000 non-Muslims have also been displaced.
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday they had spoken with Suu Kyi and that they said they were working to get aid to areas in Myanmar affected by violence.
The generals still control national security policy but nevertheless, Suu Kyi has been widely criticized abroad for not stopping or condemning the violence. The campaign against the Muslim insurgents is popular at home.
The U.N. refugee agency said the Rohingya arriving in Bangladesh were suffering “real hardship, and some of the most difficult conditions seen in any current refugee situation”.
“With the influx increasing daily, UNHCR is appealing for an initial amount of $30 million for the emergency humanitarian response in Bangladesh until the end of year,” an agency spokesperson said in Geneva.
Bangladesh says all refugees must go home and has called for safe areas in Myanmar. Myanmar has ruled that out and says it will accept anyone who can verify their citizenship. Most Rohingya are stateless.

Thousands of people demonstrated after Friday prayers in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, to denounce the treatment of the Rohingya.
One protest leader said they were demanding a U.N. peacekeeping force and that Myanmar face charges in an international court.
The Jazz Documentarian Who Won The Lottery

Around 2009, Brooklyn native Brandon Bain started shopping for a new video camera. He'd sung in choruses growing up, but had recently started going to open mics and jam sessions to try their hand on stage. To their surprise, they discovered that the city they grew up in housed a ton of young, undersung jazz talent — and they grew anxious to document it.
Bain talked to a film-director friend who recommended a specific model. That choice was seconded by another friend later that week. Of course, Bain didn't quite have the $2,600 to purchase such a camera. Then, suddenly, they did.
Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Capsulocity Courtesy of Capsulocity
"That same guy who recommended it to me, the second guy, I asked them for four numbers between 0 and 9," Bain says. "And within a few weeks, that number came. I can't even make that up, but that's what happened: I won exactly $2,600."
The New York Lottery has a game called Win4 where you pick four numbers and hope they're the same as those drawn. There are different ways to multiply your bet, but the bottom line is that if you aim to win $2,500 or more, your odds are 10,000 to 1.
With those odds in their favor, Bain, now 31, launched Capsulocity — at Capsulocity.com, or via a YouTube channel — a series of video "capsule" portraits of young jazz musicians in New York City. They didn't have much of a journalism or multimedia production background (apart from a few college courses), but they managed to sell a few musicians they knew on the idea of an interview and performance vignette.
Pianist Christian Sands was the first artist Bain approached, and the subject of Capsulocity's pilot episode in 2012. Amid an industry-wide debate about young musicians, I stumbled upon that clip and posted it to A Blog Supreme. I put it out of my head until I met Bain this summer on a trip to New York City. When I finally checked in on Capsulocity, it had grown quite a bit. In addition to 17 solo performances — including "name" artists like Jonathan Batiste, ELEW and recent Monk Competition winner Melissa Aldana — there were now a few duo performances. In one, Christian Sands teams up with fellow pianist Kris Bowers to create an unusual prepared-piano take on "Ain't Misbehavin'":
YouTube
I was particularly taken by these impromptu duets, which Bain has branded "That's Killin'." There's the way bassists Ben Williams and Yasushi Nakamura coax coherent improvisation out of a double-bass duo; the melody and counter-melody trading of trumpeters Jean Caze and Etienne Charles; the chemistry vocalists Charenee Wade and Charles Turner III generate flirting through "Honeysuckle Rose." They all have a certain unscripted magic about them. So I tracked down Bain and gave them a call.
"I modeled that show kind of after those old-school variety shows," Bain says. "It was always cool to see a Dean Martin and some other big female star sing a song or something like that. Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra. So I thought, just by hanging out, sometimes there'd be one piano player playing, and then there'd be five other really good piano players around, and there are good vibes between them ... and then they would jump in. I thought that was such a great thing to see, because you never knew what would happen.
"Kris Bowers and Christian Sands — they played that song 'Ain't Misbehavin'," and that really happened on the spot," Bain says. "I was even surprised watching it, honestly. That was cool — I like that feeling."
YouTube
True to Bain's background in singing, they also started a Capsulocity series of jazz divas, featuring female singers in stripped-down contexts. You might see Andromeda Turré with their mother, cellist Akua Dixon, or Sarah Elizabeth Charles accompanied only by drummer John Davis. Bain is also hoping to capture live concerts and expand the roster to include older generations of musicians.
"A lot of times you're just having fun, you're just playing music, and you're not thinking about taking a picture or taking a video," Bain says. "But I think the great thing about this generation is that we have the ability to do it ourselves. I'm just somebody — a vocalist with a camera. And Capsulocity came out of that."
The Haas F1 team has retained American teenager Santino Ferrucci as a development driver for the 2017 season alongside their commitments of a second year in the GP3 Series.
The 18-year-old, who initially joined Haas in the same role 12 months ago and enjoyed a two-day test at Silverstone last July, impressed the US squad which has seen it re-sign the youngster to act as understudy to Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen.
Ferrucci will be aiming for the GP3 Series title with DAMS this season alongside their commitments for Haas and is relishing the opportunity to continue their progress under the flight attendantship of the F1 team.
"I said it last year when I became a part of Haas F1 Team - my goal since I first started racing is to become a Formula One driver, and to be an American who is part of an American team is something I take a tremendous amount of pride in," Ferrucci said. "I learned a lot last year in GP3 with DAMS and with Haas F1 Team.
"The combination of the two allowed me to learn more and at a faster rate. I feel so much more prepared this year. I'm really looking forward to getting started."
Haas team principal Guenther Steiner is thrilled to welcome back Ferrucci and has faith in the youngster's talents ahead of their 2017 campaign.
"We're very happy to have Santino back with us and look forward to their continuing development in GP3," Steiner said. "We liked what we saw of them last year in our test at Silverstone and their maturity inside and outside of the car is impressive.
"Santino is a young, American driver with plenty of potential who is learning a lot with DAMS and us."
“Gran Turismo 7 is not currently planned” says Kazunori Yamauchi
Chris Stead 2 August 2017 NEWS
Polyphony Digital CEO Kazunori Yamauchi throws their weight behind Gran Turismo's new Sport lineage.
For two decades, the Gran Turismo series has forged a rock solid reputation as the best racing simulator out there. It's done so by putting quality ahead of regularity, with fans sometimes waiting up to six years for a new entry in the core series. But as soon as you get behind the wheel, and realise the scope of the available modes and experiences, there's no looking back.
The next entry, Gran Turismo Sport (coming to PlayStation 4), takes a slightly different tack. In the pursuit of the highest possible level of quality (in regards to visuals, audio and physics), the numbers of cars and circuits have been greatly reduced. In addition, while all of the series' recognised modes are in place, a new Sport Mode takes the series fully down the path to eSports. Not only does international glory await the best drivers, but even an opportunity to get a real world, FIA ratified racing license.
I have just returned from a studio tour of Polyphony Digital, where I enjoyed a full day playing Gran Turismo Sport and chatting with the studio's CEO, Kazunori Yamauchi. For a more detailed analysis, read my hands-on report.
Gran Turismo Sport is something that marks the beginning of a new generation or era.
Over the years, Gran Turismo series has been known to dabble in the odd spin-off. There were Prologue games for both Gran Turismo 4 and 5, three Gran Turismo Concept releases in 2002, a PSP game and more. Initially, this was what Gran Turismo Sport was thought to be. A spin-off to the series that could hold up on its own as a Gran Turismo game, but was more an outlet to focus on both eSports and VR. Surely, Gran Turismo 7 would come in the future.
Kazunori Yamauchi has, however, suggested otherwise. In mid-2016, they revealed that they considered Gran Turismo 1 through 6 to be the first generation of the series and that Gran Turismo Sport was the beginning of a second generation. “Gran Turismo Sport is something that marks the beginning of a new generation or era,” they said at the time.
Gran Turismo 7 is not currently planned.
Seeking a confirmation that their intention was to continue with the Sport lineage moving forward, I asked Yamauchi what their thoughts were around ever creating a Gran Turismo 7 and if any work had begun. This was their reply:
“Gran Turismo 7 is not currently planned. All our studios are focused on Gran Turismo Sport and, once it is out, the DLC that follows afterwards.”
On the back of previous comments made by Yamauchi about a new era for the series, and my previous reveal that Gran Turismo Sport is being made to work on the next generation of consoles, this latest statement does suggest an end to the main lineage. Later in our conversation, Yamauchi revealed how honoured they were by the interest shown in Gran Turismo by the FIA and how that changed the whole trajectory of Gran Turismo Sport to focus on its competitive mode.
Given how important the new FIA partnership is to Yamauchi and the continued growth of eSports into the future, don't expect another 1,000 cars, 100 track powered Gran Turismo 7.

The union representing 3,500 health care workers at the University of Iowa is asking the courts to decide whether it already has a binding contract with the Iowa Board of Regents.
Service Employees International Union, Local 199, filed a lawsuit Friday against the board that oversees Iowa's three public universities. The union argues that its members already accepted and ratified a two-year contract proposal with the regents and UI Hospitals and Clinics.
Josh Lehman, a regents spokesperson, said the board does not comment on pending legislation.
Regent officials have said in the past that the board failed to reach agreements before Feb. 17 with any of the unions representing faculty, students or staff at UI, Iowa State University or the University of Northern Iowa. On that day, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad signed legislation severely limiting the list of mandatory and permissible topics on which public employees could bargain collectively.
Lehman said last month, however, that the Iowa Public Employment Relations Board had issued guidance Feb. 17 stating that the bargaining process must start anew.
Previous coverage
“This is an attack on all workers at the University of Iowa,” Cathy Glasson, president of Local 199, said in a news release. "SEIU members overwhelmingly voted to accept UIHC's final contract offer weeks before the law was signed. This law was rammed through by self-interested politicians in the state Legislature and Gov. Terry Branstad using corporate-backed language that undercuts the freedom of employees to join together and have a say at their workplaces."
Members of SEIU's UIHC chapter voted Feb. 7 to ratify a previous proposal from the regents. That two-year contract including provisions for guaranteed raises, flexible schedules and a voice on the job.
The union is seeking for the courts to direct the board to comply with the 2017-19 contract. The union's current two-year contract is set to expire June 30.
SEIU's lawsuit comes during the same week that board approved a new two-year contract with United Faculty/AAUP, the union that represents about 550 faculty members at UNI. The contract, which was approved in a telephonic meeting Tuesday, calls for a 1.1 percent pay raise in both the 2017-18 and 2018-19 fiscal years.

‘Fracture' prints, not fingerprints, help solve child abuse cases
Much like a finger leaves its own unique print to help identify a person, researchers are now discovering that skull fractures leave certain signatures that can help investigators better determine what caused the injury.
Implications from the Michigan State University research could help with the determination of truth in child abuse cases, potentially resulting in very different outcomes.
Until now, multiple skull fractures meant several points of impact to the head and often were thought to suggest child abuse.
Roger Haut, a University Distinguished Professor in biomechanics, and Todd Fenton, a forensic anthropologist, have now proven this theory false. They've found that a single blow to the head not only causes one fracture, but may also cause several, unconnected fractures in the skull. Additionally, they've discovered that not all fractures start at the point of impact – some actually may begin in a remote location and travel back toward the impact site.
The team's findings were recently presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences.
“It's a bit like smashing raw hamburger into a patty on the grill,” Haut said. “When you press down on the meat to flatten it, all the edges crack. That's what can happen when a head injury occurs.”
Because piglet skulls have similar mechanical properties as infant human skulls – meaning they bend and break in similar ways – Haut and Fenton used the already deceased specimens in their research and found they were able to classify the different fracture patterns with a high degree of accuracy.
“Our impact scenarios on the piglet skulls gave us about an 82 percent accuracy rate, while on the older skulls, it improved to about 95 percent,” Fenton said.
To help them get to this level of accuracy, both researchers teamed up with Anil Jain, a University Distinguished Professor in computer science and engineering at MSU, to develop a mathematical algorithm to help classify the fractures.
“A major issue in child death cases is you never really know what happened,” Haut said. “The prosecutor may have one idea, the medical examiner another, and the defendant a completely different scenario.”
Fenton and Haut's close relationship with medical examiners often results in them being called upon in certain, hard-to-determine cases. They've used this new knowledge to help solve these cases, but both are also looking to use Jain's algorithm in an online resource that will provide even more assistance to investigators.
The team is currently developing a database, or Fracture Printing Interface, that will allow forensic anthropologists and investigators to upload human fracture patterns from different abuse cases and help them determine what most likely caused an injury.
“We will never know with 100 percent probability what happened in many of these cases, but this interface will give us a higher chance of figuring that out,” Haut said.
Their research has been funded through multiple grants from the National Institute of Justice.
Actor Kevin Sorbo said that they aren't trying to jump on the #MeToo bandwagon when they recently shared a story about how Gianni Versace reportedly hit on them back in the 1980s.
They and their wife, Sam, who are promoting their new film, “Let There Be Light,” also weighed in on the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault scandal that has been plaguing Hollywood of late.
“The casting couch has been around forever,” Kevin Sorbo said. “And I feel sorry for the decades of mostly women that have had to put up with the crap they've had to put up with.”
They said that it is tragic to see people engage in a system that they feel requires them to compromise themselves in an effort to receive work. And Sam Sorbo added that they have a theory as to why such horrific antics have so permeated Hollywood.
“The reason that they figure ‘that's the way it is' is that we live in a culture that promotes survival of the fittest and Darwinism and evolution,” they said. “We're teaching children in school that they're accidents of nature and that survival of the fittest is the law of the land. And if survival of the fittest is the law of the land, then there's absolutely nothing wrong with what Harvey Weinstein did.”
Listen to Kevin and Sam Sorbo discuss these issues — and plenty more — below:
The Sorbos described observing the desperation in Hollywood firsthand, with Kevin saying that “it's a domino effect of people having to rely on other people.”
Sorbo also spoke about recent remarks they made on comedian Adam Carolla's show about Versace alleged coming onto them in the '80s. The actor said that they aren't trying to jump onto the #MeToo train and that they had, in fact, wrote about it in their book years ago.
“[The media] want to make it look like, ‘Look what happened to me,'” they said. “It came out years ago. Why didn't they talk about it then? I didn't hide behind anything.”
Sam Sorbo suggested that the recent #MeToo campaign — comprised of people sharing their sexual assault stories — likely fueled the media coverage surrounding Sorbo's recent commentary about their encounter with Versace.
But Sorbo said they were merely sharing a story about what unfolded and they even laughed at Versace's response to their push-back.
“He puts their hand on my thigh and I said, ‘Gianni don't go there … it's not going to happen,'” Sorbo recounted. “And they say, ‘You must make love to everything in life.' And I said, ‘I'm on this road, you're on this road.' And they said. ‘I'll build a bridge.'”

Title: Assessment of Libya-Trained Terrorists' External Attack Capability
Date Originally Written: June 23, 2017.
Date Originally Published: July 3, 2017.
Summary: Libyan terrorism is not new, nor are attacks conducted outside the country by terrorists that trained in Libya. The external attack capability is evolving, however. The most recent attacks in the United Kingdom highlight the changing threat posed by Libyan terrorists, trained fighters, and their capability and intent to reach into Europe. That threat extends beyond a single group.
Text: Libya-trained terrorists have conducted multiple deadly attacks in North Africa in recent years, but the May 2017 attack against a Manchester concert by a Briton of Libyan descent, who reportedly fought and possibly trained in Libya, was among the first major attacks with direct ties to Libya outside the region, since the 2011 intervention and death of Muammar al-Ghadafi.
Although a myriad of terrorist groups, extreme militias, and umbrella organizations operate in Libya due to the permissive environment there, the most well-known remains the Islamic State. Its fighters are capable of carrying out external attacks outside the region. The capability probably resides more with the trained fighters, rather than a single group, and likely does not require a top-down structure.
Since 2011, other major external attacks specifically targeting Westerners include those in In Amenas, Algeria; Sousse, Tunisia; and Tunis, Tunisia. Terrorists reportedly staged or trained in Libya prior to all three attacks[1].
In January 2013, terrorists linked to al-Qa'ida conducted a multi-day siege, held hostages, and killed dozens in an attack against a gas plant in In Amenas, Algeria, close to the border with Libya[2]. In June 2015, gunmen opened fire on tourists at a beach resort in Sousse, Tunisia, killing and injuring dozens, which the Islamic State claimed[3]. In March 2015, gunmen opened fire at the Bardo Museum in Tunis, Tunisia, killing and injuring dozens, mostly tourists, which the Islamic State claimed[4].
The Islamic State, however, had gained a foothold in Libya prior to the attacks in Tunisia, announcing its presence there in late 2014. It quickly expanded and thrived in the lawlessness of Libya. Fighters flocked to the group. It created a stronghold in the city of Sirte.
The United Nations (UN)-backed Libyan government in late 2016 requested U.S. assistance in its fight against the group and it agreed, conducting hundreds of airstrikes against Islamic State targets in the city. The terrorists fled the city and set up training camps nearby, where the group's external plotters were reportedly planning operations against Europe. Two U.S. Air Force B-2 stealth bombers then dropped more than 100 munitions on those camps, killing more than 80 Islamic State members in January[5].
The UN-backed government declared defeat over the Islamic State in Libya, but while the group had lost its stronghold, the remaining fighters dispersed. In the intervening months, Islamic State fighters began efforts to regroup and many warned the Islamic State in Libya was attempting to consolidate once again.
It is no longer attempting. The Islamic State branch in Libya is active once more, proving yet again that airstrikes alone cannot defeat terrorism. Strikes may be a useful tool, but they are not a long-term solution. The strikes did not entirely disrupt the group or experienced fighters that already left the country.
In May 2017, the remaining Islamic State in Libya fighters made their continued presence known and then the branch's reach became apparent later that month on a global scale.
The Islamic State's branch in Libya claimed an attack in Southern Libya in early May that killed two[6][7]. Islamic State fighters also executed a man and clashed with a militia in the Bani Walid area in late May[8]. These were some of the first attacks claimed by the group's Libya branch since the airstrikes in December.
The Islamic State then claimed attacks in the United Kingdom in late May and early June 2017, both of which had Libya connections. Salman Abedi and Rachid Redouane were of Libyan descent and fought in Libya. Redouane, who helped kill and injure dozens in London in early June, reportedly fought with a militia in Tripoli that later sent jihadist fighters to Syria[9]. Abedi, who killed and injured dozens at a concert in Manchester in May, reportedly met in Libya with Islamic State members also tied to the November 2015 Paris attack[10].
Abedi also reportedly fought in Ajdabiya in 2014, was injured, and taken to Turkey for treatment using a false passport[11]. Italian investigators in April believed that an unspecified number of Islamic State fighters from Libya had entered Europe, in a similar manner to Abedi, as wounded Libyan fighters seeking medical treatment[12].
Therefore, even if the Islamic State were truly defeated in Libya today, the fatal ripple effect of its experienced fighters will likely be felt for years to come. In addition, the Islamic State reportedly has 500 fighters remaining, and possibly training, in Libya, but there are an estimated 3,000 more jihadists in the country[13].
The Islamic State is not the only terrorism problem in Libya. Only in the last three years have fighters in the country begun using the title of “Islamic State.” There were many terrorists groups in Libya before that, and many will likely come after it. The fighters flow between them.
The fighters frequently change groups and alliances based on a variety of factors at play in Libya. The groups themselves also change names, often to conceal extremist affiliation, ideology, or intent. That makes terrorist groups and fighting networks difficult to untangle.
From al-Qa'ida to Ansar al-Sharia (the group responsible for the 2012 Benghazi attacks) to the Benghazi Revolutionary Shura Council (an umbrella group) to the Benghazi Defense Brigades (a rebranding), extremist groups in Libya adapt to the ever-changing environment there[14].
Defeating the Islamic State in Libya does not solve the country's terrorism problem, as its experienced fighters retain the intent and capability of carrying out terrorist attacks.

This post contains frank discussion of a scene from last night's episode of Game of Thrones. Please proceed with caution.
The internet has been a-blaze with discussion about that scene from the episode “Breaker of Chains.” You know, the one where Jaime Lannister rapes their sister against the corpse of their dead son. Yes, that one. While I wrote briefly last night about the myth and death of “Nice Jaime Lannister,” there are many who view their participation in a rape scene as nothing short of character assassination. The biggest concern, aside from episode director Alex Graves' controversial statement on their intentions of the scene, are the differences between the way the scene played in the book and the less ambiguous way it played out on the screen. This afternoon, in the comments section of their blog, of all places, George R.R. Martin themselves entered the fray. Martin divorces themselves a bit from the decision-making process in this episode but does make effort to divorce “book” Jaime from “show” Jaime.
I think the "butterfly effect" that I have spoken of so often was at work here. In the novels, Jaime is not present at Joffrey's death, and indeed, Cersei has been fearful that they are dead himself, that they have lost both the son and the father/ lover/ brother. And then suddenly Jaime is there before them Maimed and changed, but Jaime nonetheless. Though the time and place is wildly inappropriate and Cersei is fearful of discovery, they are as hungry for them as they are for them The whole dynamic is different in the show, where Jaime has been back for weeks at the least, maybe longer, and they and Cersei have been in each other's company on numerous occasions, often quarreling. The setting is the same, but neither character is in the same place as in the books, which may be why Dan & David played the sept out differently. But that's just my surmise; we never discussed this scene, to the best of my recollection.
Martin also addresses a point that several book readers (and show defenders) have raised today. Namely that the scene in their book is from Jaime's point of view. A Song of Ice and Fire is a hugely subjective story and that's an aspect the T.V. adaptation hasn't taken on. The comparative length of Martin's epic series and the medium of literature itself allow for much more moral ambiguity and nuance.
I was writing the scene from Jaime's POV, so the reader is inside their head, hearing their thoughts. On the TV show, the camera is necessarily external. You don't know what anyone is thinking or feeling, just what they are saying and doing. If the show had retained some of Cersei's dialogue from the books, it might have left a somewhat different impression -- but that dialogue was very much shaped by the circumstances of the books, delivered by a woman who is seeing their lover again for the first time after a long while apart during which they feared they were dead. I am not sure it would have worked with the new timeline. That's really all I can say on this issue. The scene was always intended to be disturbing... but I do regret if it has disturbed people for the wrong reasons.

This article was originally published in New Zealand Geographic, issue 99 September-October 2009
Robert FitzRoy is famous as captain of the Beagle on the voyage when Darwin made their discoveries, although many New Zealanders also know FitzRoy as Governor of New Zealand before George Grey. But to meteorologists, FitzRoy is famous as one of the pioneers of weather forecasting; indeed, FitzRoy coined the term "weather forecasting". They were also a superb navigator and surveyor whose charts of South America were still in use more than 100 years after they made them.
FitzRoy's career got off to a strong start at 14 when they topped their class at the Royal Naval College then, after four years at sea as a midshipman, they became the first candidate ever to pass the Lieutenant's exam with perfect marks.
Aged 23, they were given command of the Beagle, assisting Captain King surveying South America. Off the coast of Patagonia, a few months later, hurrying to a rendezvous, FitzRoy ignored the danger signs of a plunging barometer and threatening sky, with fatal consequences. A violent pampero wind caught the Beagle with too much sail and threw the vessel on their side. Topmasts and jib-boom were blown away, along with two sailors, who drowned.
FitzRoy ordered both anchors dropped which righted the Beagle and pulled their head into the wind, saving them from foundering. Praised for their seamanship in saving the vessel, FitzRoy felt they could have done better in anticipating the sudden onset of the gale.
The coastline of Tierra del Fuego and Magellan Straits proved so complex that the survey was broken off and the expedition returned to England. The following year, the navy hydrographer, Captain Beaufort (now known for the Beaufort Scale for measuring wind strength) persuaded the Lords of the Admiralty to resume the survey and FitzRoy was ordered back to South America.
On this voyage, FitzRoy took Charles Darwin as a gentleman naturalist and companion. Constrained from conversing freely with officers under their command, FitzRoy needed someway to mitigate the loneliness of their position on such a long and stressful expedition. In fact, the previous commander of the Beagle had committed suicide after a breakdown.
The voyage, lasting from 1831 to 1836, was hailed as a triumph and FitzRoy honoured with the Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society Medal. But the voyage eventually became famous for finding evidence for the theory of evolution, something that bitterly disappointed FitzRoy late in their life when Darwin's Origin of the Species was finally published. By that time, FitzRoy's religious views had hardened into a literal interpretation of the bible and they argued that large animals like dinosaurs had become extinct because the doors of Noah's Ark were too small.
In 1841, FitzRoy was elected to parliament then, two years later, offered the position of Governor of New Zealand. Backed with few troops and little money, the job was a poisoned chalice.
FitzRoy arrived in time to adjudicate the Wairau massacre, finding that the New Zealand Company settlers had no right to try to arrest Te Rauparaha but that Te Rangihaeata was wrong to have executed the prisoners taken in the affray. This infuriated the settlers while Te Rauparaha sent a message that FitzRoy should not trouble to send soldiers to find them at Waikanae as they would be happy to turn up in Wellington with a thousand warriors on any date FitzRoy cared to name. In less than two years, political allies of the New Zealand Company engineered FitzRoy's recall while the settlers in Nelson burnt them in effigy.
FitzRoy's voyage home was notable for a storm they forecast when the ship was anchored for the night in calm weather in Magellan Straits. Both FitzRoy's barometers were falling fast but the captain ignored their warnings and retired below deck. Eventually, a young officer agreed to put out a heavy anchor on a heavy chain. When the storm struck at 2am, the heavy chain broke but tangled around the lighter chain. This was all that saved the ship from crashing into rocks and foundering with the loss of all onboard.
The chance to develop their ideas on weather forecasting came to FitzRoy in 1854 when they were appointed Meteorological Statist to the Board of Trade. Initially tasked with compiling weather statistics for each part of the globe from ship's logs, they took advantage of the invention of the telegraph to initiate forecasting. Barometers were distributed around the coast and their readings telegraphed to FitzRoy's office every morning along with wind and temperature observations. Within hours a forecast would be telegraphed back. If FitzRoy thought a storm imminent, warning symbols of drums and cones were displayed from a mast.
The storm warnings proved both successful and popular, although not infallible. FitzRoy also sent forecasts to the daily papers. Whereas their storm warnings were displayed as soon as the telegram arrived, the newspaper forecasts usually took 24 hours to appear and their success judged on how well FitzRoy's more speculative outlook day turned out.
In 1863, FitzRoy published The Weather Book containing their theories on how wind patterns and storms evolved as well as advice on how to use a barometer and a litany of horror stories of shipwrecks in storms.
Click to expand:
FitzRoy's illustration of the interaction of polar and tropical air masses looks remarkably like a modern satellite photo. From FitzRoy's The Weather Book: a manual of practical meteorology, published in 1863.
FitzRoy was working 13 days a fortnight to improve their forecasts when criticism came to a head in parliament. FitzRoy had a nervous breakdown and took their own life on 30 April 1865. Born rich, FitzRoy died poor having expended much of their wealth advancing their work. A collection was taken up for the support of their widow and children. Notable among the contributors was Charles Darwin, who praised FitzRoy as " an ardent friend to all under their sway."
The storm warnings issued by FitzRoy's staff were discontinued but soon reinstated by public demand and remain their greatest legacy. Also testament to their abilities is the number of people who served under them on the Beagle who went on to distinguished careers.
Today FitzRoy lives on in the name of one of the sea areas in the British marine forecasts, a mountain in Patagonia and numerous streets in New Zealand.
Europe: Let's Self-destruct! Translations of this item: German A reasonable question that many Europeans might ask would be whether it is not perhaps time to review priorities?
Perhaps the time has come to look at whether it remains worth it, in terms of the potential loss of human life, to remain party to the 1961 Convention, which would prohibit a country from stripping a returning ISIS fighter of their citizenship in order to prevent them from entering the country?

OAKLAND (CBS SF) – With recently released chest cam footage from an Oakland police officer providing the latest proof the city was well-aware of problems at the Ghost Ship warehouse almost two years before the fatal fire there, questions loomed for Oakland officials.
Principle among them: What exactly has changed since the deadly fire that took 36 lives last December?
In the body camera video that surfaced this week, Officer Hector Chavez is very specific about their plans after busting a music promoter at the Ghost Ship.
“I will report this to the city. I had a person telling me you guys are charging 25 bucks to get in. So I'd imagine you don't have a permit,” Chavez is heard saying in the video. “So I will be talking to the city. And we'll be dealing with the place.”
But unfortunately, this was just one of dozens of opportunities to shut down the Ghost Ship warehouse the city missed.
The police department never followed up or sent the report to building inspectors because, back then, it was considered a low-priority infraction.
The Ghost Ship Fire changed that policy. Now officers send reports of unpermitted events and buildings to a special unit and alert their supervisors.
The city has also promised better communication between fire and building departments by using a computer reporting system.
But that system is still not ready and could take another three to six months to go online.
The mayor also budgeted more money for the next two years to hire 12 fire inspectors and six building inspectors. So far, eight fire inspectors have been hired.
But the city still doesn't have a fire chief.
“The city council approves a budget, but it takes 6 to 8 months, even longer than 8 months to hire anybody,” explained Oakland City Councilman Noel Gallo, whose district includes the Ghost Ship warehouse. “So that's the challenge. We're trying to work within the bureaucracy.”
Of the 18 commercial buildings the city suspected people were illegally living in, inspectors have approved at least seven buildings. They're still working with the remaining property owners to resolve violations.
Less than three months from the anniversary of the Ghost Ship Fire, all the Oakland reforms are still very much a work in progress.
John Hayden​​ faced a decision last spring whether to turn pro or return to Yale for their senior season.
Hayden was torn at the time. Playing in the NHL was their lifelong dream and signing contract then with the Blackhawks meant they would be a step closer to it. On the other hand, the Yale experience was pulling them back. They were going to be the team captain and getting their degree was important to him.
Ultimately, Hayden decided pro hockey could wait. They were going to enjoy a final year of being a Yale student-athlete.
A day after receiving their Yale diploma, Hayden was confident they made the right choice.
“Absolutely,” Hayden said by phone on Tuesday. “I've said it before, but from a hockey standpoint, it was the right decision. Academically, it's nice being officially done having that diploma and now I can officially focus on hockey and have that as my sole profession. And then from a social standpoint, I have best friends on the hockey team for life, but all the characters at Yale. That's what makes it special. To get back and be with all them and graduate on time with the students I've been interacting with for years now is special. It was a really exciting weekend. It's nice to now be able to officially settle down and focus on training for next year.”
Plus, if Hayden had waited to finish up school, they wouldn't have the memorable tale of swiping Cubs president Theo Epstein's hat at Yale's Class Day on Sunday.
Epstein, a 1995 Yale graduate, was the honored speaker at Class Day (read the full transcript of their speech here). When they were done, Hayden was invited to the stage to be a co-recipient of the 2017 William Neely Mallory Award, which is given to Yale's top senior male athletes. Hayden received the award and then noticed Epstein had left something behind at the lectern.
“Yale has a tradition of wearing unique hats to Class Day,” Hayden said. “I went up with a Yale hat on. I noticed Theo had left their Cubs hat at the podium, so I ended up receiving my award and then taking their Cubs hat and putting it on in front of everyone. That was a fun moment.”
Did Epstein know who Hayden was?
“I don't know, probably not,” Hayden said with a laugh. “But I received an award, and they did announce that I had played for the Blackhawks, so they did know by the time I was on stage that I had played.”
Hayden also left feeling inspired by Epstein's speech.
“A lot of life lessons,” said Hayden, who officially received their degree Monday with their residential college. “One of them was about adapting and not just settling on what you're comfortable with. They also discussed the importance of being bold. I think those are valuable lessons for all the Yale graduates moving forward.”
Moving forward, it is all about hockey for Hayden. While they did put off signing with the Blackhawks and giving up the chance to play in the NHL as early as October, they still are able to make their NHL debut after signing in March and burning the first year of their contract. They had a goal, three assists and averaged 11:41 of ice time in 12 regular-season games and appeared in one playoff game.
Hayden learned a lot in a month's time.
“I'm very thankful for it,” Hayden said. “What I think is an invaluable element is being able to go into training camp with familiar faces and be able to talk to the players and the staff after a month and a half of interacting with them, that's great. And then just seeing the pace and the game of the NHL and then going into this summer with legitimate analysis of what I need to work on to make sure I'm even more effective next year.
John Hayden was Yale's captain this season. (Scott Powers/The Athletic)
“Definitely value mentally to have had those games and some success where I can tell myself I do belong. I think that goes a long way with training. You're not training with a question mark. I'm training with an understanding I can play at that level and I want to contribute even more at that level, so it's definitely motivating.”
Hayden specifically felt they needed to continue to work on their pace. They had made progress as a skater in recent offseasons, and he's looking to make more this offseason. Their plan is to again train with Ben Prentiss, who works with a lot of college and NHL players, in Connecticut.
“I think from watching the NHL for years and then playing in the NHL, it's clear the league gets faster and faster,” Hayden said. “As a bigger guy, I think if I can keep adding speed and quickness to my game and overall agility, then I'll be much better off being a power forward. Just the skill level, whether it's shooting or working on different plays below the goal line, those small details can go a long way. Those are all things I'll address this summer and things I've addressed the last few summers. Like I said, I definitely want to take strides in the speed department.”
Hayden was wiped out physically and mentally once the Blackhawks' season had ended. They had taken five classes in the fall, played Yale's hockey season, had another three classes to take in the spring and then played with the Blackhawks. As they were playing in the NHL, they were still finishing up those courses. They even Skyped into a class once while their road roommate Nick Schmaltz was in the room.
“It was difficult, but no more difficult [than college],” Hayden said. “I spent four years as a student-athlete. Managing hockey and school wasn't new to me. As far as the stress level, it didn't affect me.”
Hayden was pleased to not have to worry about juggling the academic portion any longer. They do know it'll always be there for him, though.
“Right now it's nice to have completed it,” Hayden said of their political science degree. “My goal is to play hockey for as long as I can. What's nice is just in the back of my mind to know a lot of advice in the hockey world is reminding you there's life after hockey. It's nice having a degree.”

Over 40 percent of Russians believe that the chances of getting a promotion are roughly equal for men and women. Pictured: Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matviyenko.
Overall, most Russians support equal opportunity for women, but their numbers are decreasing quickly, according to recent research.
The number of Russians against women in politics grew from 20 percent to 30 percent over the past year, reported the Levada Center. In addition, more than half of Russians do not want to see a woman as president.
The attitude of Russians towards female politicians has rapidly worsened in the past year, as seen in the results of a poll by Levada Center, Interfax reported.
About 30 percent of Russians do not at all approve of women in politics. Last year, this figure was 20 percent. Meanwhile, 54 Percent of respondents are not ready to see a woman as Russia's head of state in the next 10-15 years.
Only 33 percent of respondents were not against a female president. The other 13 percent didn't express an opinion. The share of Russians who don't want as many women as men in higher state positions also rose 10 percent in the past year, from 28 percent to 38 percent. Those who support equal rights in this matter decreased from 64 percent to 56 percent.
At the same time, 41 percent believe that the chances of getting a promotion are roughly equal for men and women. Nearly half (48 percent) felt that promotions are easily achieved by men, while 7 percent are sure that women easier climb the career ladder.
The survey was conducted from Feb. 17 to 20 among 1,600 people in 137 settlements of 48 Russian regions.

Apple, famous for its innovative products, is equally creative in its tax structure.
From 2009 to 2012, it successfully sheltered US$44 billion from being taxed anywhere in the world, including sales generated in Australia.
While there are probably some sound reasons for Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, to claim in a US congressional hearing in May 2013 that their company “complies fully with both the laws and spirit of the laws”, many people may think it is immoral for such a successful company to avoid taxation.
But the company shouldn't be alone in the being blamed for the low tax it pays around the world.
Concerted government action, including specific provisions inserted into US tax laws in 1997, have made it possible for multinationals with complex structures to funnel profits between the gaps of tax authorities.
And it is unlikely to be a coincidence that Irish tax law has been crafted to allow companies incorporated in Ireland to take full advantage of these gaps in the US.
Mapping the reach of Apple's iTax scheme and the rules it uses to hide profits is difficult, if not impossible, to discern from its financial statements.
My research on this topic would have been impossible but for information revealed in the US Senate hearing in May last year.
Indulging Apple
The tax structure of Apple is designed to ensure that little income is left to be taxed in non-US markets like Australia.
For example, when a customer buys an iPad in Australia for A$600, the sale is recorded as a revenue of Apple's distribution subsidiary incorporated in Australia.
But this company “purchases” the iPad from another Apple subsidiary incorporated in Ireland for A$550.
The Irish subsidiary is basically a shell company with no employees and no factory. The iPad was manufactured through third party contract manufacturers in China, who shipped it directly to Australia.
Hearings on both sides of the Atlantic have revealed that by effectively disabling one of its major anti-avoidance weapons in its tax law – namely the controlled foreign corporation regime – the US government has been knowingly facilitating the avoidance of foreign income tax by its multinationals.
Originally, under the US anti-avoidance regime called “subpart F”, the kinds of payments made to the Irish shell company by the Australian company would have been considered the income of the US parent.
But changes made in 1997 meant Apple was able to elect to deem the Irish company to have “disappeared” for US tax purposes, thus escaping from the US tax net.

Apple's tax structure not only takes advantage of gaps and loopholes in tax laws around the world, but also highlights the key role that politics can play in shaping these tax policies.
The US government's indulgent attitude towards the tax avoidance of its multinational firms' is all done in the name of “promoting competitiveness” of national champions, including hugely successful companies like Apple.
Ireland also plays a key role in the avoidance structure. It provides the perfect complementary tax provisions to the US, allowing firms to create tax-free income. This has successfully attracted Apple, among others, to incorporate subsidiaries in the country.
A reading of US tax history suggests that the US government is unlikely to strengthen its tax laws any time soon. The corporate lobby in the US is too powerful for Congress to ignore.
Sympathy for the authorities
So what can other countries like Australia do to protect their tax bases?
This is a difficult and complex issue requiring international consensus to reform the current cross-border tax rules. The OECD has already embarked on an ambitious project targeting “base erosion profit shifting” by these firms.
But given the divergent political agenda of the G20 countries involved in the project, it's difficult to predict an outcome.
Regardless of what progress is made by the G20, countries like Australia should consider implementing a properly designed country-by-country reporting regime.
Under the regime, a multinational would have to disclose essential tax information – like turnover and profits, tax payments and the number of employees – separately for each country where it operates.
At present, tax authorities around the world often suffer from information asymmetry.
While multinationals operate as one single enterprise, it is a challenge for tax authorities to obtain relevant information about these firms' tax affairs in order to identify targets for further investigations and audits.
It is easy to sympathise with tax authorities who find it challenging to obtain even the most basic information, like the group structures of these multinationals.
If a country-by-country reporting requirement had been in place, tax authorities would have been alerted to the extremely low effective tax rate paid by Apple in Ireland much earlier and could have taken appropriate actions promptly.
Besides this “identify-the-target” function, the country-by-country reporting system has another more important function: the deterrent effect.
If a multinational knows there is a disclosure requirement for detailed country-by-country information, it may have less incentive to pursue aggressive tax avoidance schemes.
The potential tax benefit may be outweighed by the increased risk, not only of tax investigations and audits, but also of possibly damaging its reputation.
Apple might have thought twice before implementing its iTax structure if it had known that country-by-country reporting could disclose its dark side to the public.

Manhattan Beach Police Sgt. Brian Brown said Tuesday that detectives were continuing their investigation into 15 similar cases since September in which laptops and desktop computers were stolen from vehicles of customers of the Apple Store at the Village Mall on Sepulveda Boulevard.
Last month, the Orange County district attorney's office charged three Los Angeles residents -- Garzon Diaz, Louis Lopez and John Rodriguez -- with burglary and grand theft in connection with 28 cases in which thieves broke into vehicles and stole computers from customers who had visited Apple retail stores.
A group of thieves has been taking a big bite out of Apple Store customers by purloining computers in more than 100 "follow away" burglaries across the region, authorities said.
The suspects sought by Manhattan Beach police had a specific method of operation, Brown said. They stake out an Apple Store and choose their target. Then they follow their prospective victims when they drive to another shop or a parking spot near their home. If computers are left unattended inside the vehicle, the thieves strike.
Their department issued a warning to consumers Tuesday not to leave computers or other expensive items in their vehicles in plain view.
"It's a highly preventable crime if people don't leave computers in their cars," Brown said.
But law enforcement officials said despite the arrests in Orange County, they believe these follow-away burglaries are the work of a larger ring that has taken more than 100 computers in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties.
"We are looking into whether all cases are connected to the same crime ring," said Orange County sheriff's spokesperson Jim Amormino.
The suspects who were charged in the Orange County cases were caught when they tried to break into a car with a computer purchased by an undercover police officer at the Apple Store at the Shops at Mission Viejo. The cases in that series of crimes began in December 2008.
None of the computers have been recovered by Orange County authorities, suggesting "they are being shipped out of the country or fenced right away," Amormino said.
Amormino said they had heard of similar cases in Los Angeles County including Glendale and in Ventura County, and said investigators were comparing notes.
They said law enforcement officials from around the region would be meeting "to compare notes about the possibility they are dealing with a larger ring."

With dozens of new hires, MTV is getting serious about its future by seeking a return to the glory days of MTV News.
The company has hired more than a dozen high-profile journalists to help the network better cover culture, music, and politics. Unlike its heyday in the early 1990s, however, this iteration of MTV News will be seen and heard well beyond the confines of your TV. Grantland's Alex Pappademus and Molly Lambert, The New Republic's Jamil Smith, and writer Ana Marie Cox will all be a part of the reinvigorated news team aimed at the web, your phone, and your eardrums via podcasts, as well as your television. The team will be run by the now-shuttered Grantland's founding editor, Dan Fierman.
News was once a core part of MTV's identify. Starting in the late '80s, MTV was known for its pop culture and politics coverage thanks to journalists like perpetually aging hipster Kurt Loder and Tabitha Soren, who co-hosted the televised forum where an audience member famously, and presciently, asked President Bill Clinton whether they wore boxers or briefs. Since then, however, news has given way to the unreality of reality shows like Jersey Shore.
Under new president Sean Atkins, MTV seems to be interested in addressing its dwindling TV viewership in part by bulking up a multi-platform news division that offers a clear editorial vision. The plan also seems to be an effort to compete with newer upstarts like Vox Media, Vice, and BuzzFeed, all of which have found a young audience hungry for news and entertainment coverage.
Whether MTV News can recapture the audience and cultural cred it once had is an open question. Unlike the '90s, however, you'll have a whole bunch more ways to tune in—all in the hopes that you'll want your MTV all over again.
Oliver Kylington was expected to be a top pick in the 2015 NHL entry draft. As their draft year went on, though, their stock fell. And fell. And continued to fall. Kylington went from the first-tier Swedish league to the second; just as they fell from a projected first round pick to the bottom of the second.
In the Swedish Elite League, Kylington played for Farjestad as a 16 and 17-year-old. The president of hockey operations? None other than former Flame Hakan Loob.
Loob hopped on the Fan 960 to talk about Kylington, and had a lot of praise for one of the newest Flames, saying there's no doubt he'll be an NHLer - and probably a premium player, at that. And if Loob was in charge of the Flames, he'd have Kylington in the AHL as soon as the 2015-16 season.
Getting out of Sweden
"I think they could play in the A. I think they could develop a lot there. Because I think what they need is a little bit of a tougher going," Loob said. If he's playing at a higher level, then he'd be able to grow into it.
They also think that Kylington simply needs to get out of Sweden. After bouncing around six or seven teams there - per Loob's estimate - Kylington has yet to find a home. With Calgary, though, they have an organization that will look out specifically for him, and do its absolute best to develop them to their full potential; something they aren't getting in Sweden.
The reason Kylington dropped from the first-tier Swedish league to the second? "We thought maybe that their development was a little too quick for himself. Everybody was expecting them to do great things in every game. We wanted to slow them down a little, and maybe they wanted to rush a little too much," Loob explained. Their coaches in the SEL - whose jobs are to win games, not develop prospects - may have gotten impatient with him, and ultimately, the feeling was Kylington would perform better at a lower level.
"When they were young they were pretty much three, four, five years ahead of most 12, 13, 14-year olds," Loob said. Theirs being so far ahead of their own age group, especially in the skating department - and they are a phenomenal skater - led to Kylington playing on the top pairing, and often carrying teams. This in itself explains why they were going at such a fast pace in their development: it's what they were used to.
Phenomenal talent, with one big hiccup
"His skating is just unbelievable," Loob explained. "When they take the puck in their own end, they could go by any team, in any league. Their skating is something different, something extraordinary, that's for sure.
"When it came to playing offence and trying to start an offensive threat all the time, they were just really, really good. Just to mention, they were the youngest player to ever in the Swedish League to score a goal, and that was just a rush; they were going all the way with that, too.
"In that sense, they were ready to play regularly on a team in our league."
So the problem? Kylington has their skating and offensive abilities down pat, but their defensive side of the game needs some work. Loob compared them to the recent two-time Norris winner, Erik Karlsson, as a measure of not just their abilities, but how to further proceed with Kylington's development.
"[Karlsson] could go up, score the greatest goal, but also be on the ice for three, four goals against," Loob said. "I think Ottawa did a heck of a job having the patience, letting them make the mistakes, let them lack certain things on D." Players grow and learn from those situations, and that's exactly what the Senators allowed Karlsson to do.
Loob is confident that a similar situation can play out with Kylington.
An NHLer in just a few years
Kylington won't be in the NHL next season, but Loob feels that with a two-three year plan, the Flames can have them in the NHL within that timeframe. Calgary can give them the stability they need to meet their true potential, which is that of an elite defenceman. And Loob sincerely believes that's exactly what he'll become.
As for any attitude issues? Not a problem at all, said Loob, who once spent a four hour car ride with him, picking them up from Stockholm to Karlstad, where Farjestad plays. He's a bright, mature, outgoing kid who has no problems making friends, according to the president of hockey operations.
Loob is someone who knows Kylington both in a personal and professional sense. So when they speak so highly of him, it should perhaps come with just a grain of salt... but just one grain. There's a reason their stock was so high before this season, and we now have a clearer understanding as to just how, and why, it fell; and it's not an indictment on Kylington's skill or personality at all.
Kylington has the skating, they have the scoring; they just needs to learn the defence and how to take things slower. After playing at a high level in Sweden, the AHL may very well be the best bet for their development.
So "sign him. Right away," as Loob encourages. Maybe the Flames will heed their advice.
Anyone who thinks we need government to build and maintain roads may want to consider Kauai residents don't wait for state to repair road:
Their livelihood was being threatened, and they were tired of waiting for government help, so business owners and residents on Hawaii's Kauai island pulled together and completed a $4 million repair job to a state park — for free.
Polihale State Park has been closed since severe flooding destroyed an access road to the park and damaged facilities in December.
The state Department of Land and Natural Resources had estimated that the damage would cost $4 million to fix, money the agency doesn't have, according to a news release from department Chairwoman Laura Thielen.
“It would not have been open this summer, and it probably wouldn't be open next summer,” said Bruce Pleas, a local surfer who helped organize the volunteers. “They said it would probably take two years. And with the way they are cutting funds, we felt like they'd never get the money to fix it.”
And if the repairs weren't made, some business owners faced the possibility of having to shut down.
Ivan Slack, co-owner of Napali Kayak, said their company relies solely on revenue from kayak tours and needs the state park to be open to operate. The company jumped in and donated resources because it knew that without the repairs, Napali Kayak would be in financial trouble.
“If the park is not open, it would be extreme for us, to say the least,” they said. “Bankruptcy would be imminent. How many years can you be expected to continue operating, owning 15-passenger vans, $2 million in insurance and a staff? For us, it was crucial, and our survival was dependent on it. That park is the key to the sheer survival of the business.”
So Slack, other business owners and residents made the decision not to sit on their hands and wait for state money that many expected would never come. Instead, they pulled together machinery and manpower and hit the ground running March 23. Watch the volunteers repairing the road »
And after only eight days, all of the repairs were done, Pleas said. It was a shockingly quick fix to a problem that may have taken much longer if they waited for state money to funnel in.
“We can wait around for the state or federal government to make this move, or we can go out and do our part,” Slack said. “Just like everyone's sitting around waiting for a stimulus check, we were waiting for this but decided we couldn't wait anymore.”
Thielen has been waiting, too. They want the legislature to approve their Recreation Renaissance project, a $240 million booster shot to help fix parks across the state. Without it, at least five state parks may be forced to close, and there would be no emergency repair money to fix Polihale State Park.
“We shouldn't have to do this, but when it gets to a state level, it just gets so bureaucratic, something that took us eight days would have taken them years,” said Troy Martin of Martin Steel, who donated machinery and steel for the repairs. “So we got together — the community — and we got it done.” See photos of the volunteers working to repair the road »
The park is a fixture on the west side of the island and a favorite spot for many in the area, but it's also a hub for tourists.
“Tourism is our lifeblood. It's what pays all of our bills,” Slack said. “The money that pours in comes from tourism is really an important factor for everyone here in Hawaii, and it's such an important time to encourage tourism.”
And it's an important time to keep jobs, which were threatened if the park had to remain closed. In February, Kauai‘s unemployment rate was at 9.1 percent, up from 2.8 percent during the same time in 2008, according to Hawaii's Department of Labor.
“I think it's crucial to say the doors are open, everyone is ready,” Slack said. “So when one of the most important parks in Hawaii is closed, it really changes things.”
Now, because of their hard work, volunteers hope they'll be ready to send that positive message — right in time for the tourist season.
Slack said they like to have business up and running by April 15, and the season gets busy around May 1.
The business owners and residents are hopeful that their generous contributions in time and resources mean the park should officially open soon. Pleas says they have only to get the new bridge certified and do minor cleanup.
“A lot of people are quietly sitting by, waiting for it to open,” Slack said. “This really this is one of the nicest parks in the state and in all of Hawaii, in the entire state parks department. Now, hopefully, those people get their wish.”

Hell Ship
by Philip Palmer (Orbit) – Amazon US | UK
Philip Palmer is new to me but I have been circling them for a while. Their new novel Hell Ship will be out in July. It is not set in Debatable Spaces but rather about a universe switching Flying Dutchman.
US description: There is a ship – the Hell Ship. Inside the ship is a world. On the world are thousands of alien life forms-all the last members of their race. Each and every one of them is a slave. And it was the Hell Ship and its infernal crew that destroyed their homes and slaughtered their families and imprisoned them forever. One man, Jak, has been pursuing the Hell Ship for its crimes. Battle after battle has left Jak scarred and broken and bit by bit they have surrendered their humanity to their quest for revenge. Now, Jak is no more than a mind in the body of a starship, bent on bloody vengeance. But when one slave finds a way to communicate with the Hell Ship's relentless pursuer, they realize that there is more to this mad chase than they realized. And just possibly, there's a way to end this long, interstellar nightmare. UK description: The Flying Dutchman (or Hellship) is a faster-than-light scout ship that was supposed to seek out habitable planets, while also cautiously observing alien civilisations to discover which of them might be a danger to humankind. But, a millennium ago, it flew into a black hole while being pursued by dangerous aliens. And it never came back. The vessel is now heavily armed and spends its days travelling from universe to universe – exploring, discovering, scouting and also killing, looting, and annihilating. For the captain and crew of the Dutchman all lost their minds and souls many years ago. They are now monsters, haunted by the remnants of their humanity, and they take sublime joy in killing. They are, in short, the bad guys. But luckily their nemesis David Bishop is idealistic, driven and has made catching the Hellship their life's work. This is an all-action chase drama in which the hero is the last living human being from their own particular universe. You may also find it bleakly funny, richly nasty, fast-paced and exhilarating – and maybe even terrifying.
The Clockwork Rocket
by Greg Egan (Night Shade) – Amazon US | UK
Steampunk is the new black and this blurb sounds splendid. Greg Egan is a new author for me but they have published a number of books before and this sounds too good to miss.
In Yalda's universe, light has no universal speed and its creation generates energy. On Yalda's world, plants make food by emitting their own light into the dark night sky. As a child, Yalda witnesses one of a series of strange meteors, the Hurtlers, that are entering the planetary system at an immense, unprecedented speed. It becomes apparent that their world is in imminent danger – and the task of dealing with the Hurtlers will require knowledge and technology far beyond anything their civilization has yet achieved! Only one solution seems tenable: if a spacecraft can be sent on a journey at sufficiently high speed, its trip will last many generations for those on board, but it will return after just a few years have passed at home. The travelers will have a chance to discover the science their planet urgently needs, and bring it back in time to avert disaster.
Germline
(The Subterrene War Trilogy 1) by T.C. McCarthy (Orbit) – Amazon US | UK
This is another new to me author but the blurb sounds like the kind of military science fiction I would like. The author also seems like a nice guy so I will definitely get this one.
Germline (n.) the genetic material contained in a cellular lineage which can be passed to the next generation. Also: secret military program to develop genetically engineered super-soldiers (slang). War is Oscar Wendell's ticket to greatness. A reporter for The Stars and Stripes, they have the only one way pass to the front lines of a brutal war over natural resources buried underneath the icy, mineral rich mountains of Kazakhstan. But war is nothing like they expected. Heavily armored soldiers battle genetically engineered troops hundreds of meters below the surface. The genetics-the germline soldiers-are the key to winning this war, but some inventions can't be un-done. Some technologies can't be put back in the box. Kaz will change everything, not the least Oscar himself. Hooked on a dangerous cocktail of adrenaline and drugs, Oscar doesn't find the war, the war finds him.
Heaven's Shadow
(Heaven's Shadow Trilogy book 1) by Michael Cassutt & David S Goyer (Tor) – Amazon US | UK
There is nothing wrong with an ominous first contact scenario, rather the opposite in my mind. This is another new to me author. It is amazing how many new to me authors there is.
“Heaven's Shadow” begins with the discovery of an object of unknown origin headed toward Earth. Speculation as to what it might be runs high, and leads to an international competition to be the first to land on it, to claim both the prestige and whatever other benefits there might be. Thus, two rival teams of astronauts begin a thrilling and dangerous race – but what they find when they reach their goal will turn out to be unlike anything they could have imagined …What they have landed on is no asteroid but a spacecraft from a civilization that has travelled tens of thousands of years to reach earth. While the team try to work out what it is they are needed for, more sinister occurrences cause them to wonder if their involvement with this alien race will lead to anything but harm for humanity.
Miserere: An Autumn Tale
by Teresa Frohock (Night Shade books) – Amazon US | UK
This one came warmly recommended by a frequent visitor to my blog and I found it alluring. It has a wonderful cover beside the intriguing blurb.
Exiled exorcist Lucian Negru deserted their lover in Hell in exchange for saving their sister Catarina's soul, but Catarina doesn't want salvation. They want Lucian to help them fulfill their dark covenant with the Fallen Angels by using their power to open the Hell Gates. Catarina intends to lead the Fallen's hordes out of Hell and into the parallel dimension of Woerld, Heaven's frontline of defense between Earth and Hell. When Lucian refuses to help their sister, they imprison and cripples him, but Lucian learns that Rachael, the lover they betrayed and abandoned in Hell, is dying from a demonic possession. Determined to rescue Rachael from the demon they unleashed on their soul, Lucian flees their sister, but Catarina's wrath isn't so easy to escape!

Their visit provided a sharp contrast with Theresa May, who made a private visit to the site to meet the emergency services on Thursday, but failed to speak to any of those affected by the disaster.
On Friday, the Prime Minister visited the injured in hospital.
Corbyn: Fire is 'worst nightmare'
Mrs May has called for a public inquiry into the blaze and made funding available to the local authority to pay for rehousing of the victims under a so-called Bellwin scheme, used previously for flooding.
But Mr Corbyn went far further, telling MPs yesterday: "Kensington is a tale of two cities - it is among the wealthiest parts of this country but the ward where this took place is one of the poorest… Residents must also be re-housed, using requisition of empty properties if necessary, in the community they love."
They added in a Parliamentary debate: "It cannot be acceptable that in London you have luxury buildings and flats kept as land banking for the future while the homeless and poor look for somewhere to live."
Desperate search for family members goes on
Mr Corbyn's plan was criticised by Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen, who told the Daily Mail: "It is unsurprising, following their self-delusion that they won the election that Mr Corbyn and their allies are lurching even further to the left.
"Suggesting requisitioning empty properties when empty student accommodation is available locally is completely in line with their Marxist belief that all private property should belong to the state."

Despite questions about its legality, the plan was backed on social media by former acting Labour leader Harriet Harman, who wrote: "Loads of empty flats in Kensington. Jeremy Corbyn right that government should requisition to house Grenfell survivors."

There are an estimated 20,000 empty homes in London - about 1,300 of them in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea - according to a recent analysis of figures from the Department for Communities and Local Government by the firm Property Partner.
Government sources rejected criticism of Mrs May's visit, pointing out that they had wanted to make sure the emergency services had everything they needed, and had called a public inquiry as soon as they returned to Downing Street.
But Labour MP John Mann compared their conduct to that of George W Bush, who attracted opprobrium when they viewed the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina from the air in 2005.
Media playback is not supported on this device Paula's Olympic heartbreak
"My sport is a beautiful sport. It gives me so much fun and enjoyment. The downside is that it can break your heart and spirit many times over."
Many great champions could provide that precise retrospective. That it is Paula Radcliffe, as they announced their withdrawal from the London Olympics, is a cruel reminder that sport has little interest in neat finishes and valedictions.
Radcliffe was an outside bet for their first Olympic medal in their fifth Games before their degenerative foot condition flared up again in early June.
Them age was not the only issue. Constantina Dita won marathon gold in Beijing at 38, the same age Radcliffe is now. The last two Olympic marathons have also both been won in a relatively stately two hours 26 minutes - 11 minutes outside Radcliffe's own extraordinary world record.
The problem was form, fitness and recent runs. While their last marathon, the 2 hours 23 mins 46 secs they ran for third in Berlin last autumn, gave hope of a fairytale flourish this summer in a city where they have never lost over the distance, their only subsequent performance of note was a hugely disappointing 72-minute showing in a Vienna half-marathon in April.
Radcliffe was hampered in Austria by antibiotics they were taking for a persistent bout of bronchitis, something which would have no impact on a race three months later, yet even then they were 12-1 for gold here in London with several bookmakers.
Paula Radcliffe analysis "Paula will be absolutely heartbroken. It is unlikely they would have challenged for a medal, although they would have believed they could, but to have run in London and to have finished with their head held high after all the heartache they have had in previous Olympic marathons would have been very important to her." Read the rest of Edwards' thoughts here
But this was always about more than one final tilt at a place on the podium that had eluded them as a 22-year-old in Atlanta, by a single place in Sydney, to devastating effect in the fierce heat of Athens and once again in the smog and humidity of Beijing.
Radcliffe, the greatest female distance runner this country has ever produced, desperately wanted to experience the unique opportunity of running an Olympic marathon in front of their home crowd.
At a point in their career where they could easily have stepped away to enjoy the memories and the company of children Isla and Raphael and husband Gary, they took themselves away from them for two months to train at high altitude in Kenya's Rift Valley.
Training for a marathon at their exalted level is brutal stuff, even without the mental pain of re-opening those old Olympic wounds. Radcliffe was willing to do it because the prize was important enough to them
They had first been diagnosed with osteoarthritis in their left foot at the very start of their career. When it returned at the end, necessitating an emergency dash to Munich and sports doctor Hans Müller-Wohlfahrt (who was also treating Usain Bolt), they admit they "cried more tears than ever".
Had the Olympics taken place six weeks ago they would have been on the start-line. Radcliffe, like many great athletes before, has had the particular misfortune of their own best years falling in the middle of the Olympic cycle.
In both 2002 and 2003 they were the world's best female distance runner by a street. One summer brought them the Commonwealth 5,000m title in Manchester and European 10,000m gold amid the puddles of Munich's old Olympiastadion; the next spring, at the London Marathon, they ran the 2:15.25 that still amazes nine years later.
Injury and an adverse reaction to medication ended Radcliffe's Olympic dream in Athens
Neither were Olympic years. A year later, considered as clear a favourite as anyone can be over 26.2 miles of suffering, a combination of freak injury and stomach problems caused by the subsequent anti-inflammatories brought about the infamous collapse four miles from the finish that to the ill-informed remains one of their iconic images.
Sixteen years ago their fifth in the 5,000m final promised much. Four years later they were only denied a 10,000m medal by a last-lap sprint having led for much of the contest. In Beijing a stress fracture of their femur left them short of race fitness. They hobbled home a weary 23rd.
Such timings are in the lap of the Olympian gods. Steve Cram dominated 1500m running in both 1983 and 1985 but struggled with injury in the Olympic year in between and had to settle for silver in Los Angeles.
The man who beat them to gold, Sebastian Coe, had missed the whole of the previous season with toxoplasmosis and would struggle throughout 1985 with back problems. In 1984, Olympic year, they ran clear and free.
Radcliffe's record on the road suggests they deserved an Olympic medal. But, as Mark Cavendish and Michael Phelps could have told you on Sunday evening, the Games pay little attention to reputation.
Radcliffe did win a major championship gold, their marathon triumph at the Worlds in Helsinki in 2005 going a little way to easing the pain of their Athens defeat the previous summer, but will now end their career without their sport's ultimate prize.
It should not detract from how the nation feels about them
Them marathon world record, not even approached anyone since, is the sort of Beamonesque mark that only a great athlete at an almost unimaginable peak could produce.
Them ceaseless hard work and determination, despite all the setbacks, are a telling example to any young athlete, while their hard-core anti-doping stance throughout their career saw them speak out when many of their contemporaries stayed silent or worse.
There may now be no poetic send-off on the streets they once ruled, but it takes nothing away from the athlete they have been.
"No-one tells us in advance where the limits of our own bodies lie," they said on Sunday. "Pushing these limits is the only way we can ever achieve our highest goals and dreams."
Radcliffe pushed as hard as anyone.
The Heritage Foundation's action group will be met with Obamacare supporters. | JAY WESTCOTT/POLITICO Liberals fight anti-Obamacare tour
The Heritage Action tour to defund Obamacare is getting an unwelcome visitor: Obamacare allies.
Americans United for Change and Protect Your Care are planning to travel across the country to counteract Heritage Action's nine-city August tour calling on Congress to choke off funds to the president's health care law.
Story Continued Below
“We're not going to let this dangerous and ludicrous proposal be touted without a response — we're going to every state they are [going to] and our presence will be felt,” the liberal groups wrote as they ann0unced the tour Friday. “We'll hold our own events in some cases with dozens of concerned citizens, elected officials, doctors, nurses, students, seniors and people from across the spectrum who are or will benefit from the law.”
The Heritage Action tour, meant to drum up support for defunding the health care law during the congressional budget battles this fall, will be led by former Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina and starts Monday in Fayetteville, Ark.. It wraps up Aug. 29 in Wilmington, Del. Some of those advocating defunding say it's nonnegotiable — even if that means a government shut down.
Supporters of the president's health law will hold their own events and speeches hours before the Heritage stops, and they'll be visible at the Heritage events, too. They'll also use mobile billboards in Fayetteville and Dallas on Tuesday, where the Heritage tour will be joined by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex), whose prominent role in the funding fight has brought them national attention and a burst of speculation about 2016 presidential ambitions.
The Obamacare allies claim the law's opponents want to take away tangible benefits people are receiving, like preventive care and coverage for young adults. They say the GOP foes of the law want to deny health coverage to people —a theme that President Barack Obama hit hard in last week's White House press conference.
“If [opponents] had their way, middle-class families could once again be bankrupted and lose everything because of an illness, accident or medical emergency,” the groups wrote. “Revoking coverage for people could be life-threatening in many cases.”
Americans United and Protect Your Care recently announced a 10-state operation to aggressively fight back against GOP messaging in the ramp up to enrollment in Obamacare coverage, which starts Oct. 1 and runs for six months. The effort is also backed by Health Care for America Now, Planned Parenthood Federation of American, the Center for American Progress, SEIU and AFSCME.
The tour announcement comes a day after FreedomWorks revealed an effort to confront Republican lawmakers who haven't signed onto the effort to defund Obamacare in upcoming budget battles.

(CNN) Google "Trump pivot" and you get about 707,000 search results. That's because reporters, political strategists, pundits, many voters -- and presumably members of their own staff -- have for this entire election cycle been collectively wondering if Donald Trump is ever going to become a smart, serious and disciplined candidate.
The speculation over whether the campaign is leaving its old ways behind has bubbled up again with Paul Manafort's replacement as campaign manager with a seasoned pollster, Trump's vague but still surprising expression of regret last week for their hurtful words and the seeming effort to walk back a promise to employ a "deportation force" to physically remove 11 million illegal immigrants.
But while the focus now seems to be the durability or otherwise of this latest "pivot," few are asking the much more important question: When did we construct this new version of the political pivot, whereby a year's worth of garbage is erased or forgiven, and why do we apply it only to Donald Trump?
From the moment Trump descended on the Trump Tower escalator last year, and proceeded to call Mexican immigrants "rapists," to just this Monday, when they tweeted out tabloid gossip about a pair of MSNBC hosts , there's nothing conventional about the way Trump has run their campaign.
Some have found that exciting -- indeed, enough to elect them the Republican nominee. But many others, including most other Republicans, have found it disturbing or even disqualifying.
Trump themselves has offered conflicting takes on a so-called pivot. Back in April they promised that the hiring of the likes of political "expert" Manafort was proof that "the campaign is evolving and transitioning, and so am I. I'll be more effective and more disciplined."
We've yet to feel bored, and as recently as last week, they told a Wisconsin television station , "I am who I am. It's me. I don't want to change. ...I don't want to pivot. ...If you start pivoting, you're not being honest with people."

Clearly, Trump has done little, save for occasionally reading from a teleprompter, to indicate they are capable of, let alone interested in, changing their penchant for "telling it like it is" -- or, what psychologists call blurting.
But as GOP strategist Rick Wilson noted , with exasperation, the media falls for the pivot talk every time. "It's the 87th pivot this year. And every time this happens you know that there's a clock running. And that clock is, when does Donald Trump get their phone back and start tweeting again? When does Donald Trump start letting their verbal dysentery spray out all over the world again?"
Of course, most presidential candidates have to shift somewhat after courting their base voters to courting undecideds, independents and moderates. But those shifts typically look more like a slight broadening and softening of message.
What those shifts do not entail is an expectation of some kind of mass amnesia, whereby general election voters forget about the inexcusable, offensive, alarming things the candidate has said or done for the past year.
Those that have mulled a more dramatic repositioning have learned that you cannot, as Mitt Romney aide Eric Fehrnstrom suggested in 2012, treat the general election pivot as an "Etch A Sketch" where you can "kind of shake it up and we start all over again."
Why? Because we don't live in the era of the Pony Express, when news took forever to reach us. There's no un-seeing or un-hearing what someone -- especially someone as loud-mouthed as Trump -- has been saying for a year. Even a voter who isn't tuning in during the primary will have heard about their antics.
Yet this reality doesn't seem to stop the media offering the Trump campaign the privilege of the pivot treatment. No one suggested, for example, that after Hillary Clinton admitted keeping a private server at their house was a bad idea that they were somehow pivoting toward becoming a more truthful person or accountable person. Yet, we are discussing on an almost daily basis whether Trump can pivot toward becoming a less extreme person.
What is particularly disturbing about all this is that we in the media are feeding into this idea that what a candidate says over the course of an election is somehow meaningless, malleable, temporary and transposable. In doing so, we are telegraphing to voters the exact opposite of how to hold a person seeking public office accountable. If we're not, why should they?
Ultimately, if Trump really were pivoting, it would either mean they said the things they did -- from banning Muslims to use of nuclear weapons -- because they believed them, or because they were only using them to win. Neither should be an acceptable excuse.
Words matter, and they should stick. Let's ban the word pivot, until it can be used appropriately and responsibly again. Because in the era of Trump, there's no such thing.
Image caption A mock-up of the planned Hemlis app
One of the Pirate Bay file-sharing site's founders has announced plans for a "totally secure" rival to WhatsApp and Apple's iMessage services.
Hemlis, which means secret in Swedish, will use end-to-end encryption so messages are seen only by the sender and recipient.
Peter Sunde said it was a response to governments spying on users' data.
The iOS and Android project is quickly approaching its $100,000 (£149,133) funding target.
However, Apple and WhatsApp say communications using their services are already "fully encrypted".
Blackberry is also planning to extend its BBM chat service - which can be made fully secure - to other mobile operating systems.
The team behind Hemlis said their service would be more beautiful and user-friendly.
'Secure, fun and sexy.'
Hemlis is being crowdfunded by users who can opt to pay either in the virtual online currency Bitcoin or PayPal.
In return for a $5 donation, they are being offered free access to all the premium features regular users would normally have to pay for, such as picture-sharing.
Image caption Peter Sunde was one of three co-founders of the Pirate Bay file-sharing site.
In contrast, other apps are often funded by selling adverts or user data - a model the app's developers want to steer away from.
"We're interested in helping, not selling users", said the developers.
"No-one can spy on you. Not even us."
The move by the Pirate Bay co-founder comes after recent revelations that the US government's National Security Agency has been using a system called Prism to tap into data stored by US-based technology giants including Google, Facebook and Apple.
Both the Thunderbird email client and the SeaMonkey Internet browser have taken a backseat when it comes to development resource distribution over at Mozilla. The products are clearly not as popular as Firefox, and since resources are limited, Firefox is clearly the one product that is getting the most love at Mozilla.
Development resources were moved from Thunderbird last year, which had the result that all releases for the email client afterwards were more or less limited to security and stability fixes.
Seamonkey users on the other hand may have noticed that their product has vanished from Mozilla's product page recently whereas Thunderbird is still listed on the page.
Add-ons on the other hand are still accessible on Mozilla Add-ons, so that Thunderbird and Seamonkey users can download and install extensions from the official website for their product.
If you are following the development over at Mozilla you may know that the organization plans to merge AMO, that is Mozilla Add-ons, with the Firefox Marketplace.
A very likely consequence of this is that Thunderbird and Seamonkey won't be supported anymore on Mozilla Add-ons. A recent conversation between Philip Chee and Mike Conley, Seamonkey and Thunderbird leads, indicates this in clear terms:
(Philip Chee) Well the reason I ask is that once amo gets merged into marketplace, TB and SM extensions are going to get the boot
This stance is confirmed in a conversation between Philip Chee and Jorge Villalobos, Mozilla Add-ons Developer Relations Lead.
(Jorge Villalobos) It's likely that when marketplace and AMO and consolidated (whenever that is), applications that aren't Firefox will be dropped entirely.
What we know
We know that Mozilla will merge AMO and the Firefox Marketplace in the future. There is no data for that yet, and it may very well be in 2015 the earliest.
A very likely consequence of the new AMO is that Mozilla products that are not Firefox related won't be supported by it.
This means that both Thunderbird and Seamonkey will have to find alternatives that they can use to provide users with extensions for the products.
Closing Words
A likely outcome is that Thunderbird and Seamonkey extensions will be moved to another domain, or two domains, from where they are offered to users. It is highly unlikely that this means the end of extensions for the products, but a solution still has to be found. In regards to that, a solution for existing add-ons needs to be found in the same context.
What is irritating is that both product leads have not been notified by Mozilla about the upcoming changes. (via Sören)

On 9th July 2012 the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Samsung Electronic (UK) Limited's Galaxy Tablet Computer, namely the Galaxy Tab 10.1, Tab 8.9 and Tab 7.7 do not infringe Apple's registered design No. 0000181607-0001
"The informed user's overall impression of each of the Samsung Galaxy Tablets is the following. From the front they belong to the family which includes the Apple design; but the Samsung products are very thin, almost insubstantial members of that family with unusual details on the back. They do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the Apple design. They are not as cool."
As instructed by a UK court, Apple has posted a small link in the footer of Apple.com/uk . The notice acknowledges the judgement that Samsung had not infringed on the iPad design with their Galaxy Tab. The text of the notice starts:But Apple's notice is somewhat playful and goes on to quote directly from the judgement where the Judge describes that Apple's design is "cool" and ultimately the Samsung design is simply not as cool. The Judge wrote:Apple goes on to explain that the case was also tried in Germany and that in that court Samsung was found guilty. In the end, they write "So while the U.K. court did not find Samsung guilty of infringement, other courts have recognized that in the course of creating its Galaxy tablet, Samsung willfully copied Apple's far more popular iPad."The link must remain on Apple UK website for a period of one month, and Apple is also required to run ads acknowledging the ruling.
This entry was posted in Vulnerabilities, WordPress Security on November 16, 2017 by Mark Maunder 16 Replies
Vulnerabilities have been reported in the Formidable Forms, Duplicator and Yoast SEO WordPress plugins. The Premium version of Wordfence protects against all of these vulnerabilities, even if you have not updated your plugins yet. We do recommend that you update immediately, whether or not you are using the Premium version of Wordfence.
The details of the vulnerabilities are as follows:
Formidable Forms 2.05.02 and older has multiple severe vulnerabilities
Jouko Pynnönen disclosed multiple vulnerabilities in Formidable Forms version 2.05.02 and older. The report included multiple serious problems:
A preview function allowed unauthenticated users to execute an arbitrary shortcode. Normally, the use of shortcodes is restricted to site authors or administrators, as many of them could be used to exploit a site.
One of the plugin's shortcodes included a SQL injection vulnerability.
Another shortcode allowed an unauthenticated user to view form responses.
Form previews were vulnerable to reflected cross site scripting.
Form input was not sufficiently sanitized to prevent stored cross site scripting, which could have been used to target administrators when they viewed form responses.
Formidable Forms is used by over 200,000 active sites according to WordPress.org. The Formidable Forms team has released multiple updates addressing these issues, starting at 2.05.02. We released a firewall rule today, protecting Wordfence Premium customers from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Free users should upgrade to version 2.05.05 immediately.
Duplicator 1.2.28 and older vulnerable to stored XSS
WPVulnDB also reports that the Duplicator, running on over 1 million active sites, fixed a stored cross site scripting vulnerability affecting versions 1.2.28 and older. This report also included the code changes.
Duplicator version 1.2.29 fixed this issue, but their changelog does not mention a vulnerability (there is no currently entry at all for version 1.2.29). Wordfence includes built-in protection against attacks of this nature, so both Premium and free users should be safe.
Yoast SEO 5.7.1 and older vulnerable to unauthenticated XSS
Ryan Dewhurst's WPVulnDB is reporting that Yoast SEO fixed an unauthenticated cross site scripting vulnerability that affected versions 5.7.1 and older. The code change showing the fix is linked to from the WPVulnDB report.
Wordfence also protects against this exploit (both free and Premium).
Conclusion
We encourage you to share these vulnerabilities with the larger WordPress community to help keep site owners safe from exploitation.
Today I found out what happens when you stick your head into a particle accelerator.
Exhibit A: Anatoli Petrovich Bugorski, a Russian scientist who has the distinction of being the only person to ever stick their head in a running particle accelerator. Shockingly, they also managed to survive the ordeal and, all things considered, came out without too much damage.
Bugorski was a researcher at the Institute for High Energy Physics in Protvino, working with the Soviet particle accelerator: The Synchrotron U-70.
On July 13, 1978, Bugorski was checking a malfunctioning piece of equipment. As they were leaning over the piece of equipment, they stuck their head through the part of the accelerator that the proton beam was running through. They reported seeing a flash that was “brighter than a thousand suns”, but did not feel any pain when this happened.
The beam itself measured 2000 gray as it entered Bugorski's skull and about 3000 gray when it exited on the other side. A “gray” is an SI unit of energy absorbed from ionizing radiation. One gray is equal to the absorption of one joule of radiation energy by one kilogram of matter. An example where this is commonly used is in X-rays. For reference, absorption of over 5 grays at any time usually leads to death within 14 days. However, no one before had ever experienced radiation in the form of a proton beam moving at about the speed of light.
As you can see from the picture, the beam entered the back of Bugorski's head and came out around their nose. Shortly after this happened, Bugorski's left half of their face swelled up beyond recognition. They were taken to the hospital and studied as this was something that had never been seen before and so they closely monitored them thereafter, fully expecting them to die within a few days at most.
Although the skin on the part of their face and back of their head where the beam hit peeled off over the next few days and the beam had burned through their skull and brain tissue, Bugorski did not die and actually came through it all surprisingly well.
Despite the beam going through their brain, their intellectual capacity remained the same as before. The few negative health drawbacks they did experience were not life threatening either. They lost the hearing in their left ear and experienced a constant unpleasant noise in that ear from then on. The left half of their face slowly became paralyzed over the course of the next two years. They also get significantly more fatigued with mental work, though they did go on to get their PhD after this incident. The remaining side effects were occasional absence seizures and later tonic-clonic seizures, though these didn't show up right away.
The most bizarre side effect that occurred because of this has to do with their face. Looking at Bugorski now, you'd see the right half of their face looks like a normal wrinkled old man, but the left half of their face looks as if it was frozen in time 32 years ago. Apparently Botox's got nothing on a particle accelerator's proton beam for stopping wrinkles. 😉

Bonus Facts:
During absence seizures, the person will often appear to be just staring off into space. There is no typical jerking or twitching as is associated with many other types of seizures. Absence seizure victims will often move from one location to another without purpose or thought behind it. What is happening here is, under normal circumstances, thalamacortical oscillations maintain normal consciousness of an individual; during absence seizures these are disrupted.
A synchrotron is a cyclic particle accelerator where a magnetic field and an electric field are carefully synchronized with a traveling particle beam. The magnetic field turns the particles so they circulate; the electric field accelerates the particles.
Tonic-Clonic seizures are more typically what most people think of when we think of seizures. During the “tonic” phase the person will lose consciousness and their muscles will suddenly tense. This typically only lasts a few seconds. During the “clonic” phase the muscles will start to contract and relax rapidly, causing the person to convulse sometimes severely.
Bugorski went on to get their PhD after this incident and worked as a scientist for many years. In 1996, they applied for disabled status to receive their epilepsy medication free, but was turned down. They also tried to make themselves available to Western researchers but was unable to afford to leave Protvino.
Bugorski is married to Vera Nikolaevna and they together have one son named Peter.

Obama and the Neocons are “all in” as the American president gives notice “boots will go on the ground” in Syria. Make no mistake, this report is a test of the will of the American people, please pay close attention, we are about to relive Vietnam.
In a previous report which called for the impeachment of President Barack Obama, this author presented a list of possible alternatives to America's “so far” failed Syria posture. Here's a look at this administration's most recent scheming in the Middle East. If we let our leadership get away with this one, we're in very big trouble indeed.
CNN reports cannot always be taken as fact, but this one announcing Barack Obam's decision to put “boots on the ground” in Syria can. Vladimir Putin's air posture having revealed both US forces' inability to destroy ISIL, and Russia's obvious seriousness, it's forced the hand of Obama and the Neocon US Congress as well. My previous argument for my country to save face in the world of power politics, it must have provoked some deep thinking in Washington. NEO's Tony Cartalucci fills us in on the gravity of this situation, but let me recap my earlier assessment.
The people of the United States are becoming nearly as fed up as the rest of the world with America's horribly ineffective “peacekeeping” actions globally. The situation in Syria is a black eye and a bloody nose for all Americans, for a citizenry to have allowed policy to have become business. Energy and corporate business vestments having always been one set of administration goals, millions fleeing or dying wherever the US military flies, sails, or lands, it's now embarrassing. Last time I offer impeaching Obama over continued proxy warring, CIA meddling, letting the Russians take over, and the unlikely positive of joining the Russians to kill ISIL. It's apparent now, the think tanks and the Pentagon want to play more mind games with people's lives. Obama is posturing to put US Special Forces in, but not for the reasons you might think.
My Dutch colleague, political analyst Holger Eekhof contends the Special Forces objective will be a rescue mission to extract key jihadist operatives and assets from underneath the Russian-Syrian-Hezbollah front, in order that they may be useful for future projects in the region. In this, I feel quite sure Eekhof is correct. What more could 50 specialists manage to do in such a war zone. Embedded with the Kurds in the North and East of Iraq, the teams can easily make incursions to extract “moderate” ISIL assets. In this operation, Eekhof contends, the Americans have an easier job than in post Nazi Germany times (for instance). This time, unlike in the de-nazification process, American service personnel only have to ask one simple question; “Have you been photographed, or do you normally use a mask?” The implication is clear, and so is the dual purpose of this latest “Obama mission objective” – erased all evidence of CIA and American asset manipulation, and insert Americans under the guns of the Russians to ensure it works. This is why it has been announced officially instead of owning up to the fact Special Forces are already there. Special Forces teams are never given away in this fashion, BEFORE their missions are completed. The American Secretary of State, John Kerry, has already begun the de-islamification of ISIL, or IS, or Isis or wtf…. once again renaming the terrorist organization “Daesh.”
For the last year the United States and the coalition have been essentially flying air cover for ISIL over Syria and Iraq. Looking at the utter destruction Russian air forces are heaping on jihadists and the ISIL terrorists in the last couple of weeks, it's evidence enough western military forces were spending $10 million a day bombing ant hills in the deserts out there. Nothing positive from Centcom can be shown really. Interestingly, and I must say complimentary for me, the Russians took the advice to essentially televise air war success, to out do the American ant bombers, if nothing else. Sorry, this media war has tended to inflame my personal sense of irony, and of cynicism. Carrying on with the current bad ideas from Washington though, these maniacs are going to end up getting millions killed. Here's why.
If I am right, if the Russians are right, and the United States of America has been funding and flying interference for jihadists, anti-Assad extremists, al-Queda, and in fact ISIL , then putting US Special Forces “advisers” on the ground training al-Queda and the like will prevent Russian air and Assad forces from killing them. Think on this for just a moment…. really think….. and then I shall continue.
I am doing another investigation concerning the broader picture of US foreign policy overall. I mention this because within that story commentary and faces from the most recent Armed Services Committee meetings in Washington play a significant role in the global mess Obama's leadership has been practiced under. US Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter (please read all of this) appeared before the committee to reveal the latest strategy mind boggle. I'll let the reader watch the CSPAN video, but what you will see is at least one utter psychopath, Senator Lindsey Graham of my home state of South Carolina calling for all out confrontation with Russian forces in Syria. You read that correctly. The sidekick of Arizona Senator John McCain not only brow beats Carter and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, they arrogantly and bombastically forecasts US and coalition forces fighting Russia to beat Assad – period! Don't take my word, watch Graham play god of war in the video.
My friends, these people are quite insane. I know this is what level heads will think, once they read the Central Command Report about Carter, their (get this) “Three Rs” solution to ISIL, and especially after listening to South Carolina's resident war monger. (Please read my in depth report to come) Now get this, most urgently. Central Command all but certifies the plan is to “engage Russia” in the wording of the report I linked you to. The subheading “Russia Won't Impact Counter-ISIL Campaign” let's the reader know for sure, impacting Russia's effective campaign is EXACTLY the purpose of the Pentagon plan. Forgive western media people, and the Pentagon, they think you are all idiots.
Carter goes on to differentiate the US-Russia strategies in Syria, but here is the most stunning fact of US support for jihadists in Syria, please ponder if you will the fact the Pentagon, the State Department, the Presidency, not our Congress really informed the people of the United States that “killing Assad” was the mission after all! With 500,000 news reports blaming Vladimir Putin for anything negative on planet Earth, America arming, funding, and flying air cover for terrorist groups we in fact created ………. It's nowhere on the news radar in my country. Nowhere, I tell you. Once has to be an expert internet researcher simply to find out about Bush's policies to create the Syrian opposition to Assad.
To conclude, this most recent policy shift has emergency consultations with Washington think tanks written all over it. This Sputnik International report with my analysis offers up the Brookings Institute to the altar of chaos causation, not to mention Pentagon asymmetrical strategists. South Carolina's Graham, their lunatic friend John McCain, and other caricature corporate puppets out of Dr. Strangelove, they're going to get a lot more people killed. The CNN report alludes to an escalation past a token Special Forces group already being planned. The whole affair wreaks of pre-escalated Vietnam, and mark my words this is where things are headed. In my coming report readers will be struck by the parallels between Senator Graham, and past rolls of South Carolinians in war advocacy. The bottom line for now is, this Washington play should not be allowed to stand. I'll try and further enlighten early next week, but for now let me leave you with a quote from CNN:
“America has bombed targets in Syria since September 2014 without stopping ISIS, and it has largely failed in a mission to recruit and train moderate rebels in Syria to take on the terror group. In recent months, the U.S. has also bolstered its aid to local forces, air-dropping weapons, ammunition and other supplies to rebel forces inside Syria.”

A group of passionate archivists are trying to make the Library of Congress the standard-bearer for video game preservation. It won't be easy.
Wikimedia Commons/USCapitol Library of Congress Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation
Dave Gibson can tell you about some of the weirdest video games ever released: A 1995 Mac game narrated by David Sedaris, for example, or The Catechism Game, which touts itself as "The first and only Church Approved Catechism Game for Catholics!", or better yet, 'N Sync Hotline, a 2001 PC game that came bundled with a cordless phone capable of delivering special bedtime messages from Justin Timberlake and Joey Fatone. As a moving image technician at the Library of Congress' National Audio-Visual Conservation Center, Gibson — along with a few colleagues — sorts through all of the games coming in for copyright, parses private donations, and can wax proudly about the rare jewels of the Library's game collection. In other words, if there's a video game Librarian of Congress, it's probably Dave Gibson. He's the expert. And yet, they only spends a quarter of their time working with games. No, the work of game copyrighting and archiving at our country's signal institution for cultural preservation is not done by a dedicated full-time staff. Instead, it's the passion project of a handful of archivists who want to be the new standard-bearers in the preservation of video games. Indeed, the state of video game collection at the Library is something of an expression of the liminal state of video games in American popular culture writ large. The Library recognizes the cultural importance of video games, but only devotes four people part-time to their archiving; Game companies insist that their products are the medium of the future, but don't trust archives with their source code; Collectors sell their troves on Craigslist and eBay rather than considering donation. Even to get to this point, though, has been a journey in and of itself.

In 2007, the Library of Congress moved its gargantuan collection of audio-visual material from Capitol Hill to a vault underneath a hillside in Culpepper, Virginia, alongside some of the world's most precious A/V artifacts. The 6.3 million items transferred to the brand-new Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation included the original negatives of Casablanca, the first-ever 45-rpm record, and the original broadcast reel of NBC moving from black and white to color television. Among the treasures — and the comprehensive collection of C-Span footage — was a unique tranche: 3,000 pieces of software, or the Library's entire archive of computer games. They're kept in large manila folders on shelf after shelf deep within Packard. "It is part of our mandate to preserve, collect, and make accessible the riches of American creativity," said Mike Mashon, the Head of the Moving Image section of Packard, who personally lobbied to make Packard responsible for games. "And video games are a vital part of that."
BuzzFeed/Joseph Bernstein
That original collection was far from comprehensive. Mostly PC games, the titles were generally archived either because they had some perceived educational value (Reader Rabbit), because they were controversial enough to enter the cultural conversation (Grand Theft Auto), or because they were ubiquitous (Myst, The Sims). Today, that archive has doubled to more than 6,000 titles. This patchwork — the original endowment, plus thousands of games received and sorted for copyright, plus private donations — is the domain of Gibson and three colleagues, Trevor Owens, Brian Taves, and David March. Gibson, 37, whose mop of straw-colored hair, baby face, and contagious excitement give them the aspect of a recovering teenager, grew up in North Carolina playing games. They studied moving image archiving at UCLA, and started working for the Library of Congress in 2006. When the Moving Image Section acquired the Library's games, they knew it was a rare opportunity. "It's fallen to us to deal with games," Gibson said. "We want to collect for the sake of archiving our nation's video gaming heritage."

They and the team face enormous logistical, technical, and bureaucratic challenges. Today, there is no established standard for the copyrighting, or cataloguing, of video games. Prior to the early 1990s, the Library simply required a written description of the game. "We probably have a written description of Mario," Gibson said, "somewhere in a warehouse next to the Ark of the Covenant." From the early 1990s to 2007, the Library upped its requirements for copyright to a description, 50 pages of source code, and a half-hour video of gameplay. It was an improvement, but hardly up to the standards of movies: The Library has its own several-volume tome dedicated to the standard cataloguing and copyright of moving images. After the move to Packard, the Library started recommending, but not requiring, an actual copy of the game. Gibson estimates that Packard now receives about a quarter of all new releases. But just keeping up with newly released material is a daunting task. Every week, Gibson and their colleagues have to sort through several massive tubs brimming with material to be copyrighted. A game might come in six or seven different editions, each for a different platform. Having a standard system of archiving and copyrighting — something currently being discussed by the Library's Recommended Format Specification Group — would make the job significantly easier. It would also clarify the work of the other major game archives, at Stanford, the University of Texas, and the Strong Museum in Rochester, New York. "I suspect that when motion pictures first started arriving here in the 1890s, these same discussions were taking place," said Mashon. Indeed, the Packard collection includes paper prints of early films — long strips of photographic paper containing every frame in a movie — that were the first copyright standard for the medium. Movies can be recreated from these prints; Gibson sees the source code of games as a similar, genetic, reference. More pressingly, the Moving Image Collection currently has no good way of dealing with digitally distributed media, and not just video games. The Library's processes are, by the standards of 21st century media consumption, antiquated. Netflix has to print special VHS copies of their streaming hits like Orange Is the New Black and House of Cards for copyright consideration. As games move toward exclusively digital formats, the Library has to standardize digital specifications for fiber optic copyright submission, and then it needs the major game publishers to comply. The Library has strong relationships with big film studios, who come to Packard for prints when they want to publish new editions. Many game publishers, though, see the archivists' desire for comprehensiveness as a threat. "Most game companies," Gibson wrote in 2012, "view the source codes as trade secrets not to be distributed." That, according to Gibson, is a mistake, especially since the Library keeps all material under lock and key. "Archives are trying to save and legitimize the things they're making," they said. And Gibson's work has already gone well beyond cataloguing into real discovery and preservation. Earlier this year, Gibson found a DVD-R loaded with a file directory containing comprehensive assets for a Duke Nukem game developed for the PlayStation Portable that had never been released. Working with a Packard software developer, Gibson was able to access the proprietary asset formats and see glimpses of a game thought lost to time, something that's especially important as technology accelerates the cycles of obsolescence for consoles and software. "The discovery of that which has been lost or previously unattainable is one of the driving forces behind the archival profession and one of the passions the profession shares with the gaming community," Gibson wrote in a blog post in August.

Yesterday Nancy Pelosi granted an interview to a San Francisco television station, and the first ninety seconds are something to behold. They repeated their request that the National Park Service deny a permit to an alleged “alt-right demonstration” called Patriot Prayer. Pelosi said “not allow these elements to use a national park to spew forth their venom.” They then said that “protecting people” was the Park Service's “first responsibility.”

When the interviewer, Pam Moore, pressed Pelosi to consider Patriot Prayer's First Amendment rights, Pelosi responded, “The Constitution does not say that a person can yell wolf in a crowded theater. If you are endangering people, then you don't have a constitutional right to do that.” You can watch the full interview here:
Where to begin?
First, It's flat-out unconstitutional for the park service to deny a permit to any group simply because public officials deem the group's speech venomous. Even if their speech is truly vile, they have the same right of access to the park as any other expressive organization.
Second, while we want law enforcement to protect people, it is also required to protect liberty. Any police force that maintains security without also protecting liberty has failed in its core constitutional function.

Third, the quote is wrong. She's obviously referring to Oliver Wendell Holmes's famous statement in Schenck v. United States that “The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic.” Fire. Wolf. Whatever. It's not important compared to the next point below.
Fourth, anyone who quotes Schenck is quoting bad law. In fact, it's one of the most “odious free speech decisions in the Court's history.” The court upheld the Espionage Act conviction of the secretary of the Socialist Party of America for writing and distributing a pamphlet opposing the draft during World War I. Schenck could never be sent to jail for this conduct today.
The proper standard is outlined in Brandenburg v. Ohio, and that case is completely silent regarding the wolf threat. Under Brandenburg, speakers can advocate violence even in front of an armed crowd unless their speech is “directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action” (emphasis added).
Finally, while the law obviously prohibits any member of the alt-right or any other group from engaging in violent acts, the Constitution does not permit the state to shut down an event simply because other people threaten the speaker. That's an extreme form of heckler's veto, and law enforcement is obligated to protect speakers, not silence controversial speech.

In other words, don't ask Nancy Pelosi about the First Amendment. They have no idea what it means.

Poison Pen Deborah Blum writes about chemicals and the environment.
In the late 19th century, German scientists discovered that an easy-to-make acid could rather neatly peel off a layer of skin cells. They promptly marketed it for “skin rejuvenation.” Today, that compound, trichloroacetic acid, or TCA, is widely used by dermatologists both to brighten up aging faces and to remove damaged skin cells, including precancerous ones.
More than one million people received chemical peels from dermatologists in 2012, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. The procedures can be performed with a variety of acids, but TCA is especially popular because it can reduce sun damage, pigment spots and acne scars. TCA is so popular, in fact, that it is sold in do-it-yourself formulas at pharmacy chains like Walgreens and online retailers like Amazon.
But a growing number of studies, mostly in laboratory animals, have suggested that TCA has troubling, more destructive effects. Recently the International Agency on Cancer Research moved to classify it as a suspected human carcinogen, and in July, the state of California followed suit, announcing its intent to add TCA to the state registry of toxic substances. Researchers have been taking a hard look at TCA's safety both for patients and practitioners.
“When there's evidence of carcinogenicity in animals, we assume it has the potential to cause harm in humans,” said Martha Sandy, chief of the Reproductive and Hazard Assessment Branch of the California Environmental Protection Agency. Even if the evidence is uncertain, they said, it is important that both consumers and businesses be told of potential risks.
“One of the purposes of putting a compound on the list is to make the public aware of the current state of scientific knowledge,” Dr. Sandy said.
You don't have to get a chemical peel to be exposed to TCA. It is used as an antiseptic, a soil sterilizing agent and a reagent in pharmaceutical manufacturing; it turns up in drinking water as a byproduct of chlorination, and as a metabolite of some industrial solvents and some medications, like chloral hydrate, a common sedative. Research with animals shows that it can be absorbed both in drinking water or through dermal exposure, seeping through the skin into the bloodstream.
Concern about the acid has been growing since the 1990s, when early studies began linking it to cancers in animals. The California E.P.A. first flagged it as a potential carcinogen in 1999, but decided the evidence wasn't strong enough to say more.
But scrutiny intensified after a 2011 review by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which cited study after study in lab mice linking TCA to liver cancer; one research group called it a “complete carcinogen.”
Although the bulk of the TCA studies involve animals, a few human studies also hint at harm. A report published this summer in the journal Environmental Science and Pollution Research found evidence of both genetic and cellular damage in human subjects.
But such research is rare. The federal E.P.A.'s analysis emphasized the dearth of good human studies: “No human epidemiology or occupational studies of TCA were located. Case reports and accounts of the medical use of TCA for skin treatments demonstrate its potential for skin corrosion and eye irritation. However, no information on systemic toxicity following dermal exposure of humans to TCA was identified.”
So do chemical peels with TCA raise your risk of cancer? “The short answer is, nobody knows,” said Dr. Michael Hadley, an associate professor of dermatology at the University of Utah and a co-author of a chapter on TCA in the Color Atlas of Chemical Peels. “I can tell you that the link is not proven or shown in any human studies. But that's partly because we haven't done the long term research that would give us all the answers.”
Dr. William Coleman, the editor-in-chief of the journal Dermatologic Surgery, points out that the cancer findings derive from long term exposures in laboratory animals. A person receiving a chemical peel, on the other hand, is exposed to TCA for only a few minutes before the acid is washed off. Further, TCA causes a mild coagulation of skin proteins, which they said should reduce absorption of the acid into the bloodstream.
“I continue to use TCA without hesitation,” they said.
Even public health advocates admit that it's difficult to assess the risk. “Cancer is complicated, exposures are complicated, and it's ethically difficult to do the kinds of human studies that might tell us what we really want to know,” said Caroline Cox, research director of the Center for Environmental Health, an advocacy group in Oakland, Calif. “In the universe of chemical compounds used in commerce, there are so few that have been thoroughly tested.”
The greatest concern may be for those who are exposed on a regular basis, including practitioners who regularly apply peeling agents and consumers using over-the-counter products a bit too enthusiastically.
Both Dr. Coleman and Dr. Hadley noted that TCA sales are poorly regulated and that it is far too easy to purchase it without fully understanding the risks. Aside from the toxicity concerns, this is a powerful acid, and if applied incorrectly it can burn skin severely enough to cause permanent damage.
Meanwhile, “we're paying attention to the studies that raise concern with long toxicity,” Dr. Hadley said. The California EPA plans further analyses during the next year as the agency determines whether warning labels should be required on products containing the acid.
In the meantime, Dr. Hadley adds, “I think there's a certain amount of care that should be used.” TCA isn't the only option for those seeking rejuvenated skin; there are milder peeling agents, such as glycolic acid, as well as dermabrasion and laser resurfacing treatments. Consult with a clinician before making a choice.
Dr. Cox noted that the reevaluation of TCA by California in particular could bring new and safer products to the market. “It's often an incentive to innovate,“ they said.
The oldest-known primate skeleton, 62-million-years-old, dwelled in treetops, not on the ground, according to a new analysis.The study shows that Torrejonia, a small mammal from an extinct group of primates called plesiadapiforms, had skeletal features adapted to living in trees, such as flexible joints for climbing and clinging to branches. Previously, researchers had proposed that plesiadapiforms in Palaechthonidae, the family to which Torrejonia belongs, were terrestrial based on details from cranial and dental fossils consistent with animals that nose about on the ground for insects.The skeleton was discovered in the San Juan Basin by Thomas Williamson, Curator of Paleontology at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History&Science, and their twin sons, Taylor and Ryan, on land administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) under permit. The study in Royal Society Open Science , supports the hypothesis that plesiadapiforms, which first appear in the fossil record shortly after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, were the earliest primates. The researchers also contend that the new data provide additional evidence that all of the geologically the oldest primates known from skeletal remains, encompassing several species, were arboreal.The partial skeleton consists of over 20 separate bones, including parts of the cranium, jaws, teeth, and portions of the upper and lower limbs. The presence of associated teeth allowed Williamson, a co-author of the study, to identify the specimen as Torrejonia because the taxonomy of extinct mammals is based mostly on dental traits, said Eric Sargis, Professor of Anthropology at Yale University, and a co-author of the study. “To find a skeleton like this, even though it appears a little scrappy, is an exciting discovery that brings a lot of new data to bear on the study of the origin and early evolution of primates,” said Sargis, a Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology and Vertebrate Zoology at Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History, where the partial skeleton was molded and cast for further study.Palaechthonids, and other plesiadapiforms, had outward-facing eyes and relied on smell more than living primates do today — details suggesting that plesiadapiforms are transitional between other mammals and modern primates, Sargis said.
The Week 10 Bye Week Is Nearing, How Could The NFC North Look Then?
The NFL season is nearly reaching its half-way point so it is becoming more clear how the standings may look when it is all said and done. There is still a lot of football to be played but some teams have already essentially eliminated themselves from playoff contention. In the NFC North there is one team that is looking like a sure playoff team, two who are right in the thick of the playoff race, and then there are the Chicago Bears.
Luckily for Detroit Lions fans, the Lions are one of the teams who are in the hunt for the playoffs. That is mostly due to the magnificent right-arm of quarterback Matthew Stafford. The Lions are going to need to find a way to be more consistent and healthy if they are going to playoffs, but both of those things are doable (The Lions' best players can't possibly continue to be injured every week…right?).
The team in the NFC North that is as close to a sure thing as there is to make the playoffs is the Minnesota Vikings. The Green Bay Packers are with the Lions as a team that is in the hunt but has work to do. Like I previously mentioned, the Bears have put themselves in an early hole that they most likely won't climb out of.
But before we move on, here is a message from Jim Mora:
Here is a look at the current NFC North standings:
Minnesota Vikings (5-1) (1-0 in the division) Green Bay Packers (4-2) (2-1) Detroit Lions (4-3) (0-2) Chicago Bears (1-6) (1-1)
Now let's examine each of these teams more closely.
Detroit Lions
Up to this point the Lions have had sort of an up and down year. In just about every game that the team has won, they relied on the ability of Mathew Stafford to perform in the clutch, which is something they have proven time and time again that they can do. There have been games where the team performed very poorly, most notably the week four loss against the Bears.
The Lions inconsistency is at least in part due to the countless injuries that the team has had to deal with this season. Defensive standouts Ziggy Ansah and DeAndre Levy have both missed time. Cornerback Darius Slay is dealing with a hamstring injury and is in real danger of having to sit out week 8.
On offense, the Lions lost Ameer Abdullah early on in the season and Theo Riddick has missed the last couple games. Tight end Eric Ebron has missed multiple weeks as well. These are just the most notable injures, there have been multiple other key players that have been forced to sit out games due to injury. The team is slowly becoming healthy again, but the success of the team may depend on whether or not key players can stay on the field.
The good news is that heading into week eight the Lions are currently riding a three game win streak. Also, in week eight the team is heading to Houston for a match up against the Texans. The Texans enter the game with a 4-3 record. Houston has lost the last two out of three games however, and has had some struggles on the offensive side of the ball. The Lions have momentum in their favor. I predict the Lions to pull this one out with a score of 27-20.
The team will face a tougher test in week nine when they head to Minnesota to face off with the Vikings. The Vikings success this season has been almost entirely due to their defense. The Lions playmakers will have a tough time doing their jobs against the Minnesota defense. However this could end up being a bit of a trap game for the Vikings. Minnesota plays a Monday night game week eight, so they will be on short rest in this contest. The Lions have a shot to really make a statement by winning this game, and I think they will do it. The Lions will pull off a shocker and win 20-17.
Week ten is the Lions bye week. This will be a valuable opportunity for the team to allow its players to get some rest.
Minnesota Vikings
http://gty.im/618896314
Before the season officially began the Vikings lost starting quarterback Teddy Bridgewater to a devastating knee injury. And to make matters worse the team's star running back, Adrian Peterson, tore their meniscus early on in the season.
Despite both of those setbacks, the Vikings have started the season strong. The Vikings defense is one of, if not the strongest in the NFL. However, the team has struggled on the other side of the football. Because of this, the team's defense does't have much room for error. The defense hasn't yet shown that they will start slowing down and they won't be able to if the team wants to continue winning.
In week eight the Vikings take on the Bears for a Monday night football showdown. The Bears have struggled to this point and this game likely won't be any different. The Vikings will win this one with a score somewhere around 21-10.
As previously mentioned, the Vikings will take on the Lions in week 9. I predicted the Lions to pull the upset and win 20-17.
And in week 10, the Vikings will head to Washington for a game against the Redskins. This won't be a cake walk for the Vikings, but they should be able to come away with the win. It will be a close game, with a final score of around 24-20 in favor of the Vikings.
Green Bay Packers
The Packers continue to lack the explosive offense that they have been known for with Aaron Rodgers under center. Granted, they also continue to win football games due to a strong defense that allows the least amount of rushing yards per game. Unfortunately for the Packers, they had to put running back Eddie Lacy on injured reserve. This will make things a little tougher on an offense that has already had its struggles.
In week eight, Green Bay heads to Atlanta for a tough game against the Falcons. Atlanta's offense has been on a roll this season, but they lost the last game they played. This game may end up depending on who can get the most out of their run game. The Packers running backs will be the “jack of all trades” Ty Montgomery, Don Jackson, and Knile Davis. Montgomery, who is normally a wide receiver, played well last week against the Bears. The Falcons have been able to run the ball well this season in large part to their running back duo of Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman. In this contest however, Tevin Coleman won't play due to injury. It will be all up to Freeman to carry the load against the Packers elite rush defense. I think this will be a close game but the Falcons will find a way to win with a score of 28-24.
Week nine, Green Bay comes back home to Lambeau field to take on the Indianapolis Colts. The Colts have an explosive offense led by quarterback Andrew Luck, but they are not a very good defensive football team. The Packers will win this one with a score of around 30-21.
Green Bay heads to Tennessee in week 10. This will be a battle between a team that runs the ball well (the Titans) and a team that shuts down opposing running backs (the Packers). Tennessee doesn't excel in many areas other than running the football. The Packers should win this one as well, with the final score being roughly 27-14.
Chicago Bears
http://gty.im/456937122
The Bears are the only NFC North team to already be out of playoff contention, unless of course there is some kind of miracle. Quarterback Jay Cutler will be back under center for the Bears in week eight, which depending on who you ask could be good or bad. Most likely if the team's “back up” quarterback Brian Hoyer didn't get injured last week then Cutler would have remained on the bench. It will be interesting to see how Cutler performs moving forward.
As already mentioned in the Vikings section of this article, the Bears take on the Vikings week eight. I predicted the Bears will lose this one 21-10.
Chicago gets their bye in week nine.
Week ten the Bears head to Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers are far from a great football team. With that said however, they are a better team than Chicago. Tampa Bay will win this one 30-17.
Recap
Here are the standings based on how I project NFC North teams to perform in the next three weeks:
Minnesota Viking (7-2) (2-1) Green Bay Packers (6-3) (2-1) Detroit Lions (6-3) (1-2) Chicago Bears (1-8) (1-2)
So looking at those standings, the Detroit Lions will head into week 11 with an opportunity for a playoff run. A big part of whether or not they will be able to pull off either winning the NFC North or grabbing a wild card spot, will depend on the health of the team. If the team can get healthy, especially on the defensive side of the ball, with the way that Mathew Stafford has been playing, this team can compete with anybody.

The shoe on the other foot: Boyd Rankin will feature for England this time around © International Cricket Council
Ireland's push for greater global recognition reaches another important landmark next week when they host England in front of what will be a record crowd at the new stadium at Malahide. The ODI is on course to be a 10,000 sell-out and, while the available seating at the new venue is one reason for the record figure, there is also a feeling that cricket in Ireland has hit a new peak this year.
The national side came very close to beating Pakistan in a two-match ODI series, while they continue to qualify for all the global tournaments put in front of them. The Inter Provincial three-day tournament has also been launched and Cricket Ireland's aim is to earn first-class status for that competition by 2015 in their pursuit of being a Test nation by 2020.
However, opportunities against Full Member teams remain rare and have to be fought for around the politicking tables of world cricket, but Cricket Ireland are determined to make the game so successful in the country that it becomes "embarrassing" for other nations not to play them more often.
"The perception of Ireland cricket continues to be one that is fairly low within the Full Member world due to the opportunities spurned by others to play us," Warren Deutrom, the Cricket Ireland CEO, told ESPNcricinfo. "But that doesn't stop us doing what we can; investing in our senior squads, investing in our facilities, getting public and private funding, and growing the sport where we can attract these big matches.
"Basically, it's about building the argument until it's one that is too embarrassing to ignore regarding how good we are becoming. We have few and far opportunities against Full Members, but look at what we do when they come along. People may still say we don't expect Ireland to win these games, we expect them to be competitive. Well, I'd say we are extremely competitive when we get the chance."
Phil Simmons, Ireland's coach, said that there is now a very different mindset within the team compared to a few years ago. "The way that we played against Pakistan showed we are learning every time we go out. We should have won the second match. We are learning how to win games. Since the 2011 World Cup, we've had that mentality. We go in to win the game and not just compete."
Deutrom was keen to stress that the England fixture on September 3 was not the "be-all and end-all" for Irish cricket.  They are well aware that pinning all ambitions on one fixture every two years does not do Ireland any favours, and also the weather does not have a record of being especially fair to this fixture, but acknowledges that it does carry extra weight given England's recent Ashes success and the fact it will be covered by Sky TV.
"Above everything else it's about the perception of Irish cricket," they said. "Having 10,000 in an Irish cricket ground against England, in front of TV cameras, with the President of Ireland and chief executive of ICC, says everything that we in Cricket Ireland have been trying to drive home."
Neither is Deutrom going to be drawn into a debate over the strength of the England side that is coming over. A number of key figures - Alastair Cook, Ian Bell, Stuart Broad, Graeme Swann, James Anderson and Kevin Pietersen - will not be making the trip to Dublin. So, as in 2011, it will be an experimental England side that is captained by Eoin Morgan, who was also the captain for the 2011 one-off encounter. This time there is also the presence of Boyd Rankin, the former Ireland quick who played against England in the 2011 fixture, to stir the emotions of the locals.
"The under-strength team still won last time," Deutrom said, referring to England's narrow 11-run success in a rain-curtailed match. "It's not as though we are hammering whoever they send over. It's a full England team that is being sent. It is at the ECB's risk that the team does not win, then they have to face the potential fall-out of that.
"If I was the ECB, I'd say whichever team we have sent over since 2006 has won. Ironically, the game we did beat them in, at the World Cup, was when they played most of their big names. We need to beat whatever they send over to justify."

Easy Vegan Pad Thai Recipe made with quick ingredients. This healthy vegan pad Thai recipe takes less than 45 min to make. I like to make this on busy weeknights!
I discovered Pad Thai at a tiny hole in the wall restaurant in lower Manhattan!
This place was tiny, but, they made a MEAN vegan pad Thai. I made special trips to that place which was completely out of my way (I lived on the Jersey shores), just to get this Pad Thai
That's how good their Pad Thai recipe!
Now, I live in Florida and going to visit this restaurant is impossible!
So, I make it at home! It's not nearly as good as the restaurant's recipe, but, it hits the spot. I love the broccoli in this recipe which I normally don't see anywhere else
The fresh broccoli is the best part of this recipe, so, don't skimp out on it.
P/S: if you like quick Asian dinner recipes, you must try my easy Lo Mein recipe
Incidentally, I have heard this recipe being referred to as Padthay. How do you refer to it?
Tips for making vegan pad Thai
– I chose to go with only 2 veggies because I wanted to keep it a quick and simple dinner recipe. If you have more time, add more veggies like snap peas, shredded carrots, cabbage and any other veggies you have in your fridge. Cook those veggies along with the broccoli and bell pepper
– For the pad Thai noodles, I kept it simple too. I went with the traditional (affiliate link) stir fry rice noodles because they are so very easy to make. All you do is put them in hot water and you have instant noodles.
– Since it is a very peanut centric recipe, I thought I would add some sriracha to accentuate the flavors of the pad Thai. Boy, was that a good decision! This meal has a nutty and spicy flavor. If you don't like the spice, just add some apple cider vinegar
– Cut veggies as small as you can. The bell peppers should have been even thinner than what I made, It really gives the Pad Thai an even texture.
– If possible, make the pad Thai sauce first and set it aside
Making The Vegan Pad Thai Sauce
1) In a small pan, add 3 Tbsp of soy sauce and heat at very low heat
2) Add 1 Tbsp of sriracha sauce and mix well
3) Add a 1/4 tsp of finely chopped ginger
4) Add 1/2 tsp of peanut butter (not pictured) and 2 tsp of brown sugar.
5) Add 3/4 cup of water (not pictured) and mix well. Remove from heat and set aside
Making The Vegan Pad Thai Recipe
1) Chop 1 broccoli crown to make about 2 cups of finely chopped broccoli. Chop half of a red pepper finely
2) Bring 3 cups of water to a boil
3) While the water is boiling, add 3 Tbsp of peanut oil or sesame oil to a pan. Heat for 30 seconds
4) Add the broccoli and red peppers to the pan and stir
5) Add 1/4 tsp of salt to the pan and stir gently
6) Add 1 Tbsp of soy sauce to the pan and stir gently. Cook until the broccoli is tender and then turn of the heat. Set aside
7) The water should be boiling now, so, remove from the heat and add the stir fry noodles to it. Don't leave them in the water for more than 8 minutes.
8) Drain the noodles and put them in the same pan that you drained them.
9) Add the broccoli and red peppers
10) Add the sauce and mix well. Top with 1/4 cup of roughly chopped peanuts (unsalted)

In spite of its financial troubles and a recent mass exodus of executives , BlackBerry is clinging on to the smartphone cliff. No more so than in security, which continues to be the main (if not only) selling point of the beleaguered mobile maker in the face of rivals.
Read this U.S. agency gives BlackBerry 10 a chance after iPhone coup One U.S. federal agency is giving RIM one more chance by testing BlackBerry 10 in the new year, after it recently announced it would ditch the BlackBerry platform in favor of rolling out iPhones. Read More
The Waterloo, Ontario-based company announced on Thursday its BlackBerry 10 phones, including the touch-screen Z10 and the keyboard-enabled Q10, in conjunction with its mobile device management (MDM) service BlackBerry Enterprise Service (BES) 10, have been awarded an "authority to operate," the highest level of certification on U.S. Defense Department networks.
BES 10 is the first MDM solution for BlackBerry 10 on the market to receive such certification, the company said.
The U.S. Defense Information System Agency (DISA), the government's IT and communications support group, is now architecting its infrastructure to support 10,000 BlackBerry 10 smartphones by the third quarter, and by 30,000 by the end of this year.
Receiving the authority to operate is an important step for the overall certification process in order to get BlackBerry smartphones running on U.S. government and military networks. The award is in effect a governmental rubber-stamp to the level of security the service provides.
A BlackBerry spokesperson explained in an email to ZDNet: "DoD users can fully embrace all of the consumer features – applications, games, multimedia, social networking — while still having full access to their DoD email."
BlackBerry senior vice president Scott Totzke said in prepared remarks that the certification "further establishes" the company's "proven and validated security model."
BlackBerry 10 devices were already granted FIPS 140-2 certification for low-level secure transmissions last year, seen as a stepping stone to higher security clearances within the Defense Dept. But this news makes the overall ecosystem a far more attractive solution to buy into as a result of the device plus management combination.
Food trends are an easy thing to hate. They immediately conjure up thoughts of "foodie" culture, $6 cupcakes, and the insufferable idiots who invented kale. But some trends are important and genuinely advance the way we eat. Twenty years ago, cheap Mexican food meant Taco Bell, ramen was $.02 worth of salt and scurvy, and high-quality beer meant Heineken. Today, people outside L.A. can get great burritos from a Mexican lady in a truck, and Cleveland exports more than just unemployment.
So yes, some food trends have merit. Bone broth is not one of them.
What is bone broth? It's stock, or water boiled with animal bones, meat scraps, and vegetables. You know it as the liquid part of pretty much every bowl of soup you've ever had. But when you call it "bone broth," it's 2015's the hottest way to separate you from your money! If you're not sure, tweet the words "bone broth" and wait for this bot from Serious Eats to correct you.
How did bone broth become a thing,then? People have been consuming broth for centuries, both for taste and for health reasons, since long before the advent of modern medicine. The current trend took off last November when chef Marco Canora opened Brodo, a broth-focused take-out window next to their East Village restaurant, Hearth.
Arrested Development predicted broth's current rise during this famous exchange back in 2006:
Lindsay: Check it out, I found that canned ham, and I put it in a pot of boiling water, and guess what I'm calling it. Michael: Soup? Lindsay: Hot ham water!
Since then, paleo dieters (the same people who eat like cavemen by avoiding the bread aisle at Whole Foods) have claimed the stuff promotes "intestinal and joint health" and healthy skin. It also allegedly prevents and reverses "osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, digestive distress, autoimmune disorders, cancer," and some made-up, allegedly autism-causing disease called leaky gut syndrome.

Even Kobe loves the stuff! According to the Washington Post, they credit it for helping them get back to sucking for the Lakers after rupturing their Achilles tendon in 2013. (Until the very next day, when Kobe was out for the season with a torn rotator cuff.) Anti-vaxxer/wife of Jay Cutler/reality star Kristin Cavallari is a fan, too.
Meanwhile, any self-proclaimed "wellness expert" profits off the hype by selling paleo cookbooks, providing pseudo-medical services, and making TV appearances on behalf of this putative invincibility potion. Dr. Oz, a man whose career is based on willful ignorance of the word "facts," recently hosted "holistic dietitian" and author of Cavewomen Don't Get Fat (they just die at 35) Esther Blum on their TV show to talk about bone broth. They claim that their "go-to morning elixir" can boost immune function, help you sleep better, and can replace your morning cup of coffee. They then proceeds to make soup and act like she's cured all disease. With leftover bones, Blum adds, each cup costs only $.15 if you make your own.
At the same time, restaurants like Brodo (and all these other stupid ones), are charging $9 for a 16-ounce cup of soup without any solid food in it. That's three times as much as Starbucks charges for coffee. Fucking Starbucks, the place that launched America's love affair with overpriced burnt coffee, is a good value by comparison. In the same clip, Canora touts more imaginary benefits to gut health, while one bored-looking Brodo customer boasts "superhuman energy." In this quasi-advertorial they wrote for Munchies, Canora further sells bone broth as a cure-all and credits it for their own improved health, ignoring the fact that literally anything is healthier than their previous diet of weed and caffeine.

In a recent piece, NPR sized up some bone broth's supposed health benefits. Several scientists agreed that they're overblown, and only come as part of a balanced diet. William Percy, an associate professor at the University of South Dakota's Sanford School of Medicine, addresses the claim that consuming collagen improves bone health ...
"Since we don't absorb collagen whole, the idea that eating collagen somehow promotes bone growth is just wishful thinking," Percy says. Instead, they say, the digestive system will break down the collagen into amino acids, and the body will use these building blocks wherever they're needed.
In short, eating collagen won't improve bone health, just like eating paper clips won't cure an iron deficiency. And this is where bone broth's health claims, like most pseudoscientific health claims, begin to fall apart on a fundamental level. The sales pitch says consuming collagen must be good for your bones, because collagen is already in your bones; the scientific reality is much more complex, but try explaining that to a general public constantly looking in vain for the next quick health fix.

People have been drinking broth to feel better for thousands of years. Chicken soup (which is "bone broth"—broth—plus actual solid food) was "Jewish penicillin" long before anyone discovered actual penicillin. When you have a head cold, consuming any hot drink will make you feel better—mostly because it's warm, and warm things feel nice. This study even notes chicken soup's mild anti-inflammatory properties. But it's not a cure-all by any means. That's what medicines are for.
But, as the health-huckster community well knows, if you take something that people know makes them feel good, tell them it'll cure all of their ills, and let confirmation bias do the rest, you can make a lot of money. It works even better when, instead of making something new, you just take something as old as time itself, give it a new name and a vaguely exotic aura, and sell it to silly white people with lots of money to burn on everything but vaccinating their children. Never mind that no empirical evidence proves "bone broth" cures anything—anecdotal evidence is enough, and anyone who says otherwise belongs to the Medical Mafia™ that puts "toxins" in the water supply. The key demographic is, as usual, conspiracy theorists and real-life Lindsay Bluths.
Even apart from the phony health claims, bone broth has fed into the worst aspects of hollow, overpriced, trendy food marketing. At this bone broth festival in New York last month, a $33 ticket got you an hour and a half to taste stock. This bar in L.A. serves broth cocktails that charge $22 for the privilege of ruining perfectly good scotch. Panera's new "Broth Bowl" line is just expensive soup with a fancy new name. The ramen joint two blocks away from Brodo sells a product that technically contains "bone broth" for just a dollar more, but theirs has roast pork and noodles in it. That product, once again, is soup.

People have been selling bullshit for as long as they've been drinking soup, and guys like Marco Canora are just modern-day snake oil salespersons. And that's all bone broth is: snake oil, miracle tonic, or quite literally, hot ham water. The hype has no more substance than the ham water itself, which Buster so eloquently described upon their return from the Army: "So watery, and yet there's a smack of ham to it."

Lawrence Edward Kasdan (born January 14, 1949) is an American screenwriter, director and producer.  They are best known as co-writer of the films The Empire Strikes Back, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Return of the Jedi, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and Solo: A Star Wars Story.
They have been nominated for three Oscars: twice for Best Original Screenplay for The Big Chill and Grand Canyon and once for Best Adapted Screenplay for The Accidental Tourist.  They are the father of directors Jake Kasdan and Jonathan Kasdan, and the father-in-law of musician Inara George.
Early life [ edit ]
Kasdan was born Jewish[1] in Miami, Florida, the son of Sylvia Sarah (née Landau), an employment counselor, and Clarence Norman Kasdan, who managed retail electronics stores.[2] Their brother is the writer/producer Mark Kasdan. They were raised in Morgantown, West Virginia,[3] where they graduated from Morgantown High School in 1966.[citation needed]
They graduated from the University of Michigan with an MA in Education, originally planning on a career as an English teacher. They lived at the Eugene V. Debs Cooperative House for a time while in Ann Arbor.[4] Kasdan won a Hopwood Award for writing during the time of their studies.[5] They were a student of Professor Kenneth Thorpe Rowe.
Career [ edit ]
Upon graduation, Kasdan was unable to find a teaching position, so they became an advertising copywriter, a profession they did not enjoy, but remained in for five years, earning a Clio Award for their work. Kasdan began their career in Detroit, later relocating to Los Angeles where they began to write screenplays.
Kasdan's introduction into the film business came in the mid-1970s when, after being rejected 67 times,[6] their script for The Bodyguard was sold to Warner Bros. as a vehicle for Diana Ross and Steve McQueen. The script became stuck in "development hell" and became one of several screenplays successively called "the best un-made script in Hollywood"; it was eventually produced as a 1992 film starring Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner.
After they sold their screenplay Continental Divide to Steven Spielberg, George Lucas commissioned Kasdan to write the screenplay for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Lucas then hired Kasdan to complete the screenplay for their Star Wars sequel The Empire Strikes Back (1980) after the death of Leigh Brackett, who wrote the first draft. Kasdan made their directing debut with Body Heat (1981), which they also wrote. Lucas later commissioned Kasdan to write the screenplay for Return of the Jedi (1983).
Kasdan is known for both writing and directing their films, which have ranged from Westerns and romantic comedies to thought-provoking dramas. They have received four Academy Award nominations, for screenplays to The Big Chill, Grand Canyon, and The Accidental Tourist, for which they also earned a nomination for Best Picture. Grand Canyon won the Golden Bear at the 42nd Berlin International Film Festival.[7]
From 1994 to 2003, they made a set of films that, in contrast to the hits they had in the 1980s, failed to break the bank in receipts; among these films were Wyatt Earp and Dreamcatcher, the latter based on the Stephen King best seller. The exception was 1995's French Kiss, which grossed $100 million.
They made cameo appearances as the lawyer of River Phoenix's character in I Love You to Death, the director of Steve Martin's character's latest action film in Grand Canyon, and in James L. Brooks' comedy As Good as It Gets as the fed-up psychiatrist of Jack Nicholson's novelist. In 2001, Kasdan was the recipient of the Austin Film Festival's Distinguished Screenwriter Award. In 2006, Kasdan received the Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement from the Writers Guild of America.
Kasdan directed the 2012 dramedy Darling Companion, starring Diane Keaton and Kevin Kline.
In October 2013, it was announced that J. J. Abrams had taken over screenwriting duties for Star Wars Episode VII (Star Wars: The Force Awakens), working alongside Kasdan, following the departure of Michael Arndt.[8] After their involvement with Solo: A Star Wars Story, they left the Star Wars universe, and has no involvement in The Last Jedi or Episode IX.[9]
On May 22, 2016, Kasdan was honored by the Atlanta Jewish Film Festival and ArtsATL.org as the inaugural recipient of their "ICON Award for Contributions to the Cinematic Arts" in a ceremony held at the Woodruff Arts Center.[10]
Filmography [ edit ]
Indeed, Sandra Pezqueda was initially hesitant to report what was happening to them to the staffing agency, Excellent Maintenance Service, which employed them at Terrenea. Soon after they started working at Terrenea, they say, a supervisor at the staffing agency would tell them that their uniform looked good on her, and that they were the prettiest girl working at the resort, according to a complaint they filed in California Superior Court last year. In their third week of employment, they offered to walk with them so they could move their car, and told them they were going through a divorce and that they would soon be single, they say. When they said they were worried about not getting back to work quickly enough because they were talking to her, they say, they told them that they were the supervisor, so it didn't matter. It was around that time that they started asking them out on dates, telling them that they would give them more work if they went out with him, and at one point, calling them at their house after she'd gone home for the day and telling them to come have coffee with him. They also told them that they were “special” and would be given 40 hours of work a week, but that the extra hours would be taken away if they did not respond to their texts. “He was the main supervisor, so everyone did what they said,” they told me.
In September 2015, they sent Pezqueda to an area of the resort where there were no cameras, followed their there, blocked the doorway, and tried to kiss her, they said. This happened twice, they said. By the end of September, they told them that they wanted Pezqueda to be their lover, they say, and when they said no, they took them off the schedule for two weeks. They complained to another supervisor in October, and was told there was nothing to be done, since it was their word against his, they say. Soon after, supervisors began “nitpicking” their work, they say, in order to create a reason to fire her, they believe. They were fired in February 2016.
In a statement provided to The Atlantic, Terrenea Resort said that both Pezqueda and the supervisor were employed by an outside staffing agency. Terrenea itself has “a zero-tolerance policy toward discrimination and harassment and are committed to ensuring all guests, and associates, are treated with dignity, fairness and respect. Our hearts go out to all of the individuals who have bravely shared their stories,” the statement said. Frank Marchetti, an attorney representing Excellent Maintenance Service, said that the company has no comment at this time.
In some industries, such as domestic work, employees have a number of different bosses, and don't have anywhere to report abuse. I spoke with another woman, Isabel Escobar, who used to clean houses for clients. One afternoon, when they were alone in the house with the homeowners' son, they called them to come upstairs, where they found they were standing in the doorway naked. They were going to have to pass them to clean the upstairs bathroom. Terrified that they were going to rape her, they ran out of the house. They called them and told them to come back, but they refused. They didn't report him, and never got paid for the job. “I felt that I couldn't talk to anyone—I was scared, isolated, and alone,” they told me. “This happens not just to famous or well-known people,” they said.
From an 1886 article in Leslie's Illustrated Weekly. (larger version)
Something to toss out when someone brings up Olympic bobsledding over the next few weeks (because that will happen, obviously): bobsled racing started in Albany.
So says historian and bobsled expert Christopher Lindsay, who's scheduled to give a talk at the Fort Orange Club February 8 about the first bobsled races. Lindsay, a former deputy executive director of the U.S. Bobsled & Skeleton Federation, says bobsleds were first used in the lumber business to haul trees. Eventually someone figured out they could be used to transport people -- and quickly -- down hills.
The image above is from an 1886 article in Leslie's Illustrated Weekly. It depicts a bobsled running down the Madison Avenue hill in Albany. Explained Lindsay to us this week: "Imagine a large block of wood and steel going down Madison Avenue with no control. There was a whole undercurrent of broken arms and broken legs." Lindsay said the sleds were eventually outlawed by the city after an alderman's sled accidentally struck and killed a child.
For a long time Switzerland was thought to be the birthplace of bobsled racing. And as it happens, even today the history section of the Wikipedia article about bobsledding includes much about St. Moritz, Switzerland and nothing about Albany, New York. But back in the 1990s then-city historian Virginia Bowers and Christopher Lindsay turned up newspaper clippings indicating that bobsledding in Albany pre-dated the sport in Switzerland -- and that a man from Albany, Steven Whitney, had helped establish the sport in the European country. [Gazette 1997]
A few years back Carl Johnson over at My Non-Urban Life pulled together a collection of accounts from bobsledding's heyday in Albany during the latter part of the 19th century. Among those accounts, a New York Times article from 1889 about Albany's 'Bob' Carnival:
In Albany the bob sled has probably reached its greatest development. Built on a series of hills the city is naturally adapted for coasting, but before last Winter the sport was not openly permitted by the authorities. When the Common Council last Winter the granted the use at night of half a dozen streets "bobbing" became a tremendous craze.
The article includes descriptions of the sleds and the festivities surrounding them. It sounds like people had a lot of fun.
Christopher Lindsay's talk at the Fort Orange Club February 8, a Saturday, is at 2 pm. Admission is $10. The event is sponsored by the Friends of the New York State Library.

Joshua M. Ferguson first came out as queer at 15 in the small Ontario town of Napanee.
Then came the bullying, physical abuse and death threats.
"I was the only out queer person in the entire high school of 1,500 kids," recalls the 34-year-old writer, filmmaker and activist who now calls Vancouver home.
Two decades after coming out, Ferguson identifies as neither a man nor a woman — and wants to take a stand on behalf of other non-binary Canadians.
Ferguson plans to head to a Service Ontario office Friday to apply for a change of sex designation from male to non-binary in hopes of getting a new birth certificate — something that's part personal journey, part activism on behalf of a community Ferguson says has a "lack of recognition."
Ferguson, an Ontario-born writer and filmmaker, hopes to obtain a birth certificate that says non-binary instead of male. (Joshua M. Ferguson)
Non-binary people "are completely invisible in our society," Ferguson says in an exclusive interview with CBC Toronto. "And we've been around forever."
Ferguson uses the pronouns they, them and their to reflect gender identity as a non-binary trans person — an identity realized some five years ago.
"I was really quite unhappy, depressed, and I knew there was something in my life that I hadn't figured out yet," Ferguson says. "There was always a piece missing, a piece of how I understood myself."

Government tackles ID concerns over gender identity
After submitting the application to Ontario's vital statistics registry later this week, Ferguson must wait for the government's decision — which could take up to six weeks — before applying for a change of sex on other forms of government-issued ID.
That's, of course, if the province approves it — and that's a big if.
Toronto transgender activist Susan Gapka says it's likely others have tried similar applications for a non-binary Ontario birth certificate privately, and have probably denied.
"People are registered at birth. They're registered in a sex without consent," says Gapka. "You can only apply in the jurisdiction where you're born ... at the current time, you cannot amend your registration of birth to anything other than male or female categories."
The federal government recently announced that Canadians will soon have a third passport option to tick off other than 'male' or 'female.' (Tom Hanson/Canadian Press)
But, Gapka says that's slowly changing. Starting last year, Ontario began issuing gender-neutral health cards and, later, gender-neutral driver's licences.
It's a conversation happening across the country.
Ferguson's application follows one by a St. John's activist who recently applied for a non-binary birth certificate in Newfoundland and Labrador.
The federal government also has said Canadians will soon have a third option, other than "male" or "female," to tick off on their passports.
The move is meant to be in the spirit of Bill C-16, which would update the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code, making it illegal to discriminate based on gender identity or expression.
That's all good news to Ferguson.
"I think in the near future, we're finally going to be counted as human beings. And that is so powerful, and so necessary."
New York-based company Waverly Labs have announced their new invention: The Pilot – the world's first translation earpiece that translates conversations between people speaking different languages in real time. The company is planning to release versions for English, Spanish, French and Italian, while versions for East Asian, Hindi, Semitic, Arabic, Slavic and African languages will be available in the future. The device is now available for pre-sale but there isn't a release date. In fact, there isn't much information about the product on their website either.
Could this device be the real Babel Fish; the machine translation device in Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy? When placed in the ear, this small yellow fish allows the person to instantly understand anything said in any form of language. Is this just the stuff of science fiction, or can we really overcome the immense problems posed by machine translation?
We only need to use the free online translation websites such as Google Translate or Yahoo! Babel Fish to see that machine translation is still in its infancy. There's a joke doing the rounds of the internet that someone took the Biblical phrase, “The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak” (Matthew 26:41) and used a free translator to translate it from English to Russian. When the same phrase was translated back from Russian to English it read, “The vodka is great, but the steak is bloody awful!”
When we use machine translation a lot is lost in translation. Here are just a few of the problems it faces.
Idioms. Idioms are metaphorical phrases such as on the house and at the drop of a hat. When idioms are translated literally into other languages they don't make any sense. This problem is illustrated nicely in the Darmok episode of Star Trek in which the universal translator is used to translate the language of the Tamarin race. However, the language is based on metaphor from Tamarin folklore and it is completely obscure when translated directly into English.
Culture-specific words. Languages have cultural words for foods, objects, values and emotions for which there is no exact equivalent in other languages. If there's no direct equivalent then translating a single word into another language may take many words in the target language, if the concept can be explained at all.
Ambiguity. Many common words have multiple meanings or senses (this is called polysemy in linguistics). For example, if someone says kind, are they talking about a “type” of something, or are they saying that someone is “good” in some way? Then there are unrelated words that sound the same (homophones). Are we talking about a pair as in two of something, or the fruit called a pear? We can ascertain the meaning of a word by its context, but machine translation isn't always capable of differentiating meaning.
If the translation device makes a mistake the results could be embarrassing, especially for business and diplomatic relations.
This was the case back in 2011 when Chinese premier Wen Jiabao made a high-profile visit to Malaysia.
There was a welcoming ceremony with a banner message written in Chinese and Malaysian. The Malaysian text said, “Official welcoming ceremony in conjunction with official visit of Their Excellency Wen Jiabao to Malaysia.” However, the Chinese text read, “Official welcoming ceremony, with them Wen Jiabao Their Excellency's official visit Malaysia.”
It was later revealed that the Malay sentence was translated into Chinese using Google Translate…
Machine translation is constantly developing, but as you can see, there are many limitations and human translation is still far more accurate at circumventing these problems. Well, sometimes.
Of course, the above translation issues apply to human translation as well.
We need only look at a website such as Engrish to see that human translation can be a challenge too…

Saying they came to last week's mayoral forum with open minds, West Roxbury residents Mary Kercz and Sharon Foley were glad they listened to the candidates' pitches.
“It gives you something to think about,” said Kercz.
Three of the four mayoral candidates who will face off Sept. 26 for two spots on the Nov. 7 municipal election ballot spoke at the event that was co-sponsored by Progressive West Roxbury/Roslindale, the West Roxbury Transcript, Roslindale Transcript and several other civic organizations.
Robert Cappucci, Boston City Councilor Tito Jackson and Joseph A. Wiley each had a turn to describe their visions for Boston to the large audience that filled West Roxbury's St. John Chrysostom Church hall as well as answer questions.
Mayor Martin J. Walsh “had to decline the invitation to attend the West Roxbury/Roslindale Progressives forum due to a prior commitment with the Boston Neighborhood Network,” according to their campaign press secretary, Gabrielle Farrell.
When Progressives member Rachel Poliner told the audience Walsh was neither coming nor sending a representative, many loud groans echoed through the room. After the meeting, Foley said they were not surprised Walsh didn't attend and felt it was not respectful.
Housing
All three candidates in attendance rued the lack of affordable housing in the city.
Navy veteran Robert Cappucci said they wanted to place a moratorium on real estate development in the city.
They said some developers gave presentations on their proposals that were just “dog and pony show[s]” since they often wait until receiving city approvals before meeting with the community to get input.
They also said several times they would be sure to communicate with President Donald Trump's administration to get federal dollars and wouldn't take money from the middle class to build affordable housing.
Jackson, who received the most enthusiastic responses throughout the evening said, “It's time that we take back our city. Our city is being sold to the highest bidder.”
They recalled growing up in Boston with a backyard and that now, to own a home in the city, “is a fleeting dream.”
Wiley tied in the lack of affordable housing to the lack of income equality.
Citing “skyrocketing” rents in once affordable neighborhoods, they said in the near future, nobody makes less than $100,000 will be able to live in Boston.
Environment
Jackson was the only candidate to specifically mention a project in the Parkway, lamenting Spectra Energy's West Roxbury Lateral gas pipeline that runs next to the only quarry in the city.
“We … need to stand up against pipelines like you have done in West Roxbury,” they said, adding they want to be sure a safety plan is in place should there be an explosion.
Three other ideas Jackson mentioned were getting locally sourced foods for the Boston Public Schools, connecting North and South stations and getting rid of plastic bags.
Cappucci tied improving the environment to streamlining the Boston Public Schools' use of hundreds of buses.
“We have a problem with 600 buses leaving fumes in our city,” they said.
Wiley tied improving the environment with improving public transportation in the city.
“That's a pet peeve,” they said, adding they have never owned a car and started taking public transportation at age 9.
Although the mayor can't directly change much on the T, Wiley said they would remain a strong advocate for better transportation.
Audience members laughed as they joked about the terrible heat inside T stations during the summer but they became somber when asking, “Why do we put up with this? … We need to stand up.”
Schools
All three candidates were passionate – and upset – about the state of the Boston Public Schools.
Wiley lived through “the horror that really was (the 1970s Boston busing) period.”
As mayor they said, “Education has to be in the forefront” of the city's efforts to improve the lives of its residents.
During their turn to speak, Jackson immediately criticized Walsh, saying they “turned their back on the Boston Public Schools as soon as they got into office.”
Jackson said the city must invest in vocational education and make sure all children have good school options close to their homes.
In addition, they said, “We should have an elected school committee,” including two youth members.
Cappucci, a former Boston School Committee member who was elected to the position rather than appointed, said they now believe that members should be appointed.
From their firsthand experience at the schools as a substitute teacher for six years, they said, “I don't want main-streaming anymore.”
They said they want students who need extra help to get it and place “the unruly students” in separate learning environments.
Immigration and racism
In order to combat racism, “first, we have to admit that racism still exists,” said Jackson.
Citing their support of making Boston a “sanctuary city,” they noted the resolution they put forward in support of Syrian refugees. They added that they believe that all Boston Public Schools should be sanctuaries, that there should be an immigrant legal defense fund and that city police officers shouldn't report undocumented immigrants to ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement).
Cappucci, a former Boston Police officer, had a different point of view.
They said if an officer has pulled over someone who is an undocumented immigrant, “We should notify ICE.”
Although they said they do not think Boston should be sanctuary city because they want to receive federal funds, they said, “I would not go after God's children on a witch hunt.”
Wiley commended Mayor Walsh for protecting immigrants.
They said during their time as an ESL teaching volunteer at the Boston Public Library's Copley Square branch, they knew some of their students didn't have the proper documentation.
“I know the palpable fear that many of them feel,” they said, adding they would not want the Boston Police to be part of “some sort of roundup” of undocumented immigrants.

DORCHESTER (CBS) – Thirty-one-year-old Alex Diaz never thought they would graduate from high school.
Growing up in a rough neighborhood in Dorchester, they joined a gang.
“I got shot, stabbed, I went to prison,” they told CBS News.
After eight years behind bars, they returned home with a new attitude.
“And I just changed everything around,” Diaz said.
They took classes where former gang members and ex-criminals are paid $400 a week to finish their high school studies, then go to college.
Mark Culliton started the program, called Boston Uncornered, last year.
They hope one day it will transform Boston, where they say there are roughly 2,600 gang members.
They were asked – some skeptics will say these young people you're helping were engaged in crime. Why should they be rewarded with $400 a week to study?
“Well because that gets down to a more fundamental question of do you believe they're bad people or that they are people that made bad choices,” Culliton told CBS.
“We're not rewarding them for their negative behavior. What we're saying is you've made mistakes that have hurt your whole community. If you want to do the right thing, we're here for you.”
Former felons and gang members recruit new students and mentor them.
Ten students, including Alex Diaz, started college this fall.
“I want to start an electricity company. I want to help people, get them jobs, teach them what I know,” Diaz said.
They hope to inspire others and says all they need is a second chance.
This three-year pilot program is privately funded. Researchers from MIT and Northeastern University will monitor the results to see if it is a success.
* Greg Hinz reports something that's being discussed widely in Cook County Democratic circles. Voters are refusing to sign the Democratic slate petitions because they have Toni Preckwinkle's name on them…
Democratic Organization precinct captains are running into something they rarely face as they pass candidate nominating petitions this fall: rejection. […]
“Voters aren't just refusing to sign, they're providing their own, not-so-kind editorial opinions” about Preckwinkle and County Assessor Joe Berrios, said one Democratic ward boss who asked not to be named. “The bulk of the comments are about the pop tax and county sales tax,” which Preckwinkle returned to level raised by their predecessor, Todd Stroger. […]
“It's a huge problem,” said one source close to the matter who asked not to be named. Some precinct workers are resorting to folding over the top line of the nominating petition so that Preckwinkle's name, which is listed first, is not visible when voters are asked to sign. […]
Dart has been advertising for volunteer petition passers on their Facebook page. Earlier this week they emailed supporters saying, “In order to get on the ballot we need your help circulating petitions and collecting signatures,” and directing them to a sign up page.
A spokesperson said Dart is passing both the joint petition and one for themselves alone. They have done that in the past, but did not do so four years ago, they said.
The winners of the Apertura 2015 and Clausura 2016 Ascenso MX campaigns will now face off in the Final por el Ascenso, the Promotion Playoff, for a spot in Liga MX.

By now, across the United States you've had the chance to check out ​Paul Thomas Anderson's adaptation of Inherent Vice, Thomas Pynchon's 2009 patchouli-scented, hazy detective story. The movie's gotten mostly positive reviews; I liked it, and I'm certainly not here to tell you, "—but you gotta read the book."
That said, you don't have to be a librarian or a ​Luddite to realize that, medium to medium, some things are going to get lost, even in an adaptation as faithful as this one: A visit from the main character Doc Sportello's parents didn't feel terribly essential on the page, and didn't make it to the screen; Doc has an acid trip that Anderson, likely wisely, opted against putting on film. Somewhere in the adapting, though, IV: The Film loses IV: The Book's slight-but-sly critique of ARPAnet, the progenitor of the internet.
Plot will be discussed, but spoilers avoided, if you're an inexplicable person who reads Pynchon and watches PT Anderson for the plot twists. In this case, though, your fears are somewhat more valid, because IV is (mostly) a detective story.
Set in the post-Manson 60s/70s turn in Los Angeles, the thickest plot, such as there is one, involves the disappearance of the real-estate mogul Mickey Wolfmann, who was having an open affair with the ex-girlfriend of Doc Sportello, the stoned hippy of a private eye. Rumors surface that Wolfmann themselves had turned hippy, realized that charging people for housing was wrong, and was planning on giving their money away, to atone—which looks like reasonable cause enough for someone to want Wolfmann out of the picture.
In the course of looking for Wolfmann, Doc pays a visit to their old PI-partner, Fritz Drybeam. Business is booming for old Fritz, because they just got something that every other PI's going to want:
"It was like being inside a science-fictional Christmas tree. Little red and green lights were going on and off everywhere. There were computer cabinets, consoles with lit-up video screens, and alphanumeric keyboards, and cables running all over the floor among unswept drifts of little bug-size rectangles punched out of IBM cards, and a couple of Gestetner copy machines in the corner, and towering over the scene all along the walls a number of Ampex tape reels busily twitching back and forth.
'ARPAnet,' Fritz announced.
'Ah no, I better not, I've gotta drive and stuff, maybe just give me one for later—'
'It's a network of computers, Doc, all connected together by phone lines. UCLA, Isla Vista, Stanford. Say there's a file they have up there and you don't, they'll send it right along at fifty thousand characters per second.'"
Fritz tells them that new computers are going online all the time, with more and more surprises and information, even where to find missing people. Naturally Doc asks is if it knows where they can score.
ARPAnet comes up a couple more times, as Doc checks back in with Fritz who was using it for more pedestrian concerns—running license plate numbers and dock records—but even though they obviously understand what people would want to use the internet for (RIP Silk Road), Pynchon doesn't really lay into the internet until their next book, 2013's Bleeding Edge, another detective story that subs late dot-com bubble-era New York in place of 70s LA.
​Techno-dread looks like a recurring theme in Pynchon's work: dread at the V2 rocket and the "black device" in Gravity's Rainbow, the unwieldy surveyor's tools in Mason & Dixon, and of course their ​1984 op-ed in The New York Times Book Review, titled "Is It Ok To Be A Luddite," a rare instance of the famously elusive writer publicly addressing an audience under their own name.
Even back in 1984, Pynchon was warning about how the unprecedented amount of data that surrounds us is subject to both failings in the tech itself, and in those who are allowed to wield it. Pynchon's a Luddite in the "class-warrior" sense that ​Motherboard's Brian Merchant outlined last Labor Day, not in a "I-don't-want-to-check-my-email-anymore," technophobic one.
In the world of Pynchonalia technological systems are only as prone to corruption as human ones. The V2 rocket is a cog within a massive military-intelligence superstate at the end of World War II, and likewise ARPAnet fits into IV's themes about both the counterculture, the FBI, and the LA police departments all failing to live up to their ideals.
How could ARPAnet really be any different? By the end of the book, Fritz is worried that the FBI is tracking their online activity, and also swearing that he's poured too much time into the computer, and it's taking away from their actual life and work—novel sentiments in the '60s that are pretty much cliché now. Fritz tells Doc how when their new hire, Sparky, "gets on this ARPAnet trip...I swear it's like acid, a whole 'nother strange world – time, space, all that shit."
With all the foresight of a character set in the '70s being written in the 2000's, Doc asks:
"So when they gonna make it illegal, Fritz?"
"What. Why would they do that?"
"Remember how they outlawed acid soon as they found out it was a channel to somethin they didn't want us to see? Why should information be any different?"
Therein lies the rub: just as Doc discovers that hippies often end up being informants and the cops realize corruption cuts both ways in IV, for all of its Whole Earth Catalog/Steve Jobs LSD tripping/saving the world rhetoric, ARPAnet becomes the internet becomes the NSA's best resource. Jobs's company goes from a garage to America's biggest corporation.
And that crunchy save the world rhetoric? Well, old Mickey Wolfmann was a millionaire who said the same thing, and look what happened to him, Pynchon may be saying.
To paraphrase a book by its cover, the vice is, you bet, inherent.
Yoon Suk has vivid, happy memories of growing up in North Korea. They were raised during a time when state-socialism was relatively functioning, and the government could provide basic necessities to its citizens. They remember wearing beautiful nylon (a highly-sought after fabric back in the earlier days of North Korea) uniforms with bows and red, patent-leather shoes to school. They also had a passion for the arts and performed frequently on stage. But as they grew older, the shine in their shoes began to fade and the hunger in their belly began to grow.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, North Korea lost crucial sources of subsidized trade and aid and the North Korean economy crashed. It was during this time that Yoon Suk got married, but what should have been a happy time in their life ended up being far from it. The regime's mismanaged agricultural and environmental policies were confounded by harsh weather, plunging the country into a severe famine that lasted for years. Yoon Suk and their husband struggled to survive on the meager rations they received—and they were not alone. During this period, an estimated one million people died from starvation, while many of those who survived suffered immensely.
Yoon Suk, knowing that they had to do something to keep their family alive during the most difficult years of the "Arduous March," turned to the jangmadang—small, illegal markets where people sold and traded anything they could for food. Yoon Suk was like many North Korean women in this new reality, abandoning their traditional role for market activities. Unfortunately, running their modest merchant business was more challenging than they had anticipated and they struggled to keep it afloat. As the situation grew worse, they discontinued their business and looked for other ways to support their family, which had grown by two with the birth of their sons. It was during this time that they learned that life might be better in booming China.
As recently as three decades ago, Chinese people were on average poorer than their North Korean neighbors. But China's economic reforms have produced wealth and opportunities that are the envy of nearly all North Koreans today. Since North Korea's economic collapse, which lead to unprecedented cross-border movement and inflows of Chinese goods and media, North Koreans have gained a painful awareness of just how far their formerly impoverished Chinese neighbors have come.
Militias from opposing ethnic groups are battling in several towns, and Kenyan Army helicopters fired warning shots on Tuesday to disperse them. There have been reports of forced circumcisions and beheadings.
The economy is paralyzed. More than 800 people have been killed since the election on Dec. 27. United Nations officials are saying the government has failed to protect civilians, including girls who have been raped at camps for the displaced.
Many Kenyans fear that their country is tumbling toward disaster. “The police are not in control,” said Maina Kiai, chairperson of the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights . “Actually, nobody is in control.”
Mr. Kiai said they were especially concerned about Mr. Were's killing because they and other prominent Kenyans, including several newspaper editors, had recently received death threats.

“None of us are safe,” Mr. Kiai said.
According to Mr. Were's guard and family members, Mr. Were had just pulled up to their gate after midnight and was waiting in their Mercedes for the gate to open when a car drew alongside him.
“I heard a beep,” said Mr. Were's wife, Agnes. “And then two loud shots. I ran out and saw my husband bleeding and people were yelling to me, ‘He's still breathing! He's still breathing!' but when I got them to the hospital they were dead.”
Mr. Were, 39, whose campaign posters show them smiling with street children, had been shot in the heart and in the eye.

The guard at their house, who was unarmed, said two men had yanked Mr. Were out of the car, shot them and drove off, without taking a thing. Family members said they were followed by suspicious cars several weeks before.
Opposition supporters immediately called the killing a political assassination, intended to intimidate their movement, which is challenging the election in December that Kenya's president, Mwai Kibaki , narrowly won, against the top opposition leader, Raila Odinga .
“We suspect the foul hand of our adversaries in this,” Mr. Odinga said.
Police officials say they are investigating closely and ruling nothing out. Some of Mr. Were's friends said the culprits might have been connected to the other contenders for their Parliament seat, who recently filed a petition to challenge the results.

Mr. Were, a successful home builder, was known as a bright spot in a gritty place. They ran an orphanage, had a footbridge and soccer stadium built in the slum where they grew up and sponsored teenage mothers to go to college.
On Tuesday morning, a huge crowd of mourners streamed into their ranch house. The grief soon turned to outrage, and by midmorning the tears had dried and the roadblocks were going up. Mourners set tires aflame and hauled huge stones into the road. It was the first time that riots had reached a middle-class neighborhood in Nairobi, and it was not just rowdy unemployed youths from the slums who were wreaking havoc.
“This is how we express our outrage,” explained Evans Muremi, a social worker, who stacked tires to burn while wearing a jacket and tie.
The election controversy seems to have brought out the worst in Kenya. While the country has been considered one of the most stable and promising in Africa , it has long been a violent place, with carjackings and muggings all too common, and mobs routinely stoning to death people suspected of crimes.

Likewise, ethnic tensions have always existed in Kenya, but have never exploded as widely as they have in the past few weeks. Ethnically driven clashes, fueled by grievances over land and power, have flared in just about every corner of the country.
The problems have laid bare the shortcomings of Kenya's poorly paid security forces, who often respond either too harshly or too feebly. Nearly two weeks ago, they shot an unarmed protester at point-blank range in front of television cameras. On Tuesday, they drove past a crowd of young men pulling down a telephone pole in front of Mr. Were's house and did nothing.

There is also a crisis of leadership. Kenya's top politicians have been arguing about who is to blame for the violence more than they have been working together to stop it. Mr. Kibaki, considered aloof even before the election, has made few public appearances since their country began to unravel. Western diplomats say they are surrounded by hard-liners bent on staying in power.
On Tuesday, they began formal negotiations with Mr. Odinga. Kofi Annan , the former United Nations secretary general, has been in Kenya for a week trying to bring the two sides together. So far, neither has budged.
Mr. Odinga says the election was rigged and is demanding a new vote. Mr. Kibaki has refused. Western observers have said the election was so flawed there was no telling who really won.
According to friends and family, Mr. Were grew up in a Nairobi slum called Dandora. They were friendly and sharp and caught the eye of some Italian missionaries, who helped put them through school.
They lived in Italy for a time and then came back to Kenya to start their construction company. Five years ago they became a councilman for Dandora. Mr. Were was from the Luhya ethnic group and their wife is Kikuyu. But that did not seem to matter.
“He was one of the least tribal people I knew,” said Wycliffe McKenzie, a friend.
They seemed to be more moderate than other opposition leaders and avoided their often belligerent talk. They told supporters not to join protests, which have often become violent and destructive.
Many people remember them as exceedingly generous. Ms. Mwangi, their friend, said they went to them when they were 19 and the mother of two and needed money to finish high school. Mr. Were stayed in touch with them through the ups and downs of single motherhood and the pressures of school.
“He told me to hang in there,” Ms. Mwangi said, as they stared blankly at the metal gate where they were shot. “He said one day you'll be my personal doctor. They told me never to give up.”
A bodybuilder who wanted to resemble The Incredible Hulk is instead feeling green, after the synthetic muscle injections they used caused myriad health problems and nearly led to the amputation of their arms.
Romario dos Santos Alves, a 25-year-old from Caldas Novas, Brazil, told Barcroft Media they started injecting their muscles with the mixture of oil and alcohol three years ago in an attempt to beef up their physique. But once they started, they found it difficult to stop.
After repeated injections left them sporting 25-inch biceps -- and in the hospital -- Alves says they realized they had to kick the habit for good. Doctors informed the bodybuilder their arms might need to be amputated because they had necrotic tissue, caused by bacteria infecting the tissue and eating away at itself. In addition, their kidneys were heavily damaged from toxins in the injections.
"I remember the doctor told me that they would need to amputate both arms," they said. "They said everything in there, all my muscles, were rock. It was either that or cut all of my muscles out."
The concoction injected by Alves is likely a cocktail known as "synthol," which the National Institutes of Health report is generally a mixture of oil, the anesthetic lidocaine as a painkiller and alcohol as a sterilizer. Use of the physique-enhancing solution can lead to nerve damage, embolism, heart attack, stroke and infections.
Oakland Raiders quarterback Derek Carr came in 92nd on the Pro Football Focus Top 101 players list.
Derek Carr's second NFL season put the Oakland Raiders starting quarterback on the map, but Carr is still not quite amongst the upper echelon of NFL talents in the minds of the mainstream media. The talented young passer ranking 100th on the NFL Network Top 100 list, a ranking that was recently echoed by Pro Football Focus as national outlets keep listing Carr in the fringes of their best player lists going into the 2016 season.
PFF ranked Carr 92nd in a recent list of the Top 101 players in the league that was compiled by senior analyst Sam Monson. Carr coming in as the second last quarterback on the Top 101 list, ranking surprisingly above Indianapolis Colts starter Andrew Luck who came in at #99 after a 2015 season that was plagued by injuries.
Despite the relatively low ranking, PFF praised Carr and identified them as one of the next top quarterbacks in the league. Claiming that the Raiders starter could be one of the top five quarterbacks in the NFL by the end of their third season in the league if all goes well for Carr in 2016.
From PFF:
92. Derek Carr, QB, Raiders Derek Carr may be the next great young quarterback in the NFL. The improvement they showed from their rookie year to their second was remarkable, and as encouraging as anything is how accomplished their supporting cast looks all of a sudden. The Raiders have quickly built arguably the league's best offensive line around him, and they have multiple weapons to play with in the passing game. Their partnership with Amari Cooper could become something special in a hurry. Already Carr has eliminated many of the simple errors that still plague some accomplished passers in the league, and if they take another step forward in 2016, they will be knocking on the door of the top five QBs in football. They ended the 2015 season as the No. 8 rated QB in the league when looking at passing grades only, ahead of Matt Ryan, Philip Rivers, and Aaron Rodgers.
PFF have been one of the Raiders the biggest advocates in recent years in praising the youth movement in Oakland, so it is no surprise to see plenty of positive comments surrounding Carr even if they are coming in as the second last quarterback on their Top 101 list of the best players in the league. Working their way into the NFL elite after just two seasons is an encouraging accomplishment, but Raiders fans will be hoping to see Carr elevate their play to the status of one of the best players in the league in 2016 as they hope that their franchise quarterback can guide them to the promised land of the playoffs with a signature season beginning in September.

We contest the criminalization of UC Santa Barbara feminist studies professor, Dr. Mireille Miller-Young. As feminists dedicated to fostering movements for anti-racist queer positive sexuality, we support Dr. Miller-Young. As feminists who work for the erotic autonomies and collective sexual self-determination of marginalized communities, we support Dr. Miller-Young. As feminists committed to challenging the incessant criminalization, surveillance, and policing of non-normative races, sexualities, and genders of people, we support Dr. Miller-Young.
In particular, we wish to question the fetishization of a pure white femininity as that which must be protected at all costs by the state. Historically, constructions of white femininity as privileged property (Harris 1993; Pateman and Mills 2007; Pascoe 2009) have been shored up to “justify” everything from lynchings, to deportation, to the mass expansion of the prison-industrial-complex. It is only through this fetishization that rightwing media pundits have been able to mobilize images of the young Short sisters as paragons of innocence and purity, while Professor Miller-Young is constructed pejoratively through tropes of racialized criminality and violence.
In this sense, the charges against Dr. Miller-Young reveal the racialized-gendered logics of the U.S. law. Dr. Miller-Young's act of challenging anti-abortion violence (not to mention protecting themselves and their students from “pro-life” protestors' anti-feminist and white supremacist barrage) is “criminal” insofar as “criminality” has already been hegemonically defined: as any challenge to the protection of property, whiteness, and hierarchal regimes of race, sexuality, gender, and capitalism.
In a recent news article about the release of the UCSB police report, Tyler Hayden of The Santa Barbara Independent, writes,
The activists, part of a Christian ministry called Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust, say they are pursuing robbery and assault charges against Miller-Young, claiming one of them was injured by Miller-Young as they followed them to their office with their sign. News of the incident has since been reported by major media outlets — primarily conservative and Christian.
The ease with which privileged white, and particularly young white gender and sexually normative appearing women, make claims to “victimhood” and “violation of property” is not a neutral move. Nor is it new. As Black, Indigenous, and feminists of color have long argued, the figure of violence against white women has long been mobilized to consolidate racist and misogynist policing and state practices (Davis 1983; Hartman 1997; Smith 2005). Furthermore, for the majority of the world's populations, access to a “proper” and non-“queered” femininity to be protected by the law is, put simply, not possible (Spillers 2003; Ferguson 2003; Silvia Rivera Law Project 2007). Indeed, the very framework through which “violence against women” has become institutionalized requires fabrications of a normative white purity that must be protected as matters of “safety” and “security” (Bumiller 2008; TGI Justice; Justice Now) This requires the construction of a perpetrator enemy Other who is continually racialized as non-white, despite the foundational violence that organizes whiteness as a historical hetero-patriarchal system itself (INCITE! 2006).
Importantly, within this framework, violence against Black women, immigrant women, women of color, and Indigenous women, as well as poor white and gender non-normative peoples, is structurally occluded. This is particularly the case when violence occurs at the hands of white men or white patriarchal institutions, such as schools, prisons, the military, and the media (Spade 2011; Stanley and Smith 2011). A gross distortion of most of the early aims of feminist anti-violence movements of the 1960s and 1970s, this schema colludes with the expansion of the prison state and security regimes, leaving no one safe (Davis 2003; INCITE! and Critical Resistance Statement). Nor does it create accountability for instances of gender and sexual violence; rather, it justifies more racist and xenophobic violence, selectively “protecting” certain women only insofar as they participate in the racist criminalization of the Other.
That the issues at stake at the protest were questions of reproductive justice also merits commentary. Indeed, the arena of Black women's reproductive freedom has long been a political battleground (Roberts 1998; Silliman and Bhattacharjee 2002). Claims over who has the right to ownership and decision making power over Black women's reproductive choices and autonomy are as old as the U.S. nation state itself. This question of ownership continues to crop up everywhere from debates surrounding welfare, to population control, to poverty, to the reproduction of the United States itself (Williams 1992; Gumbs 2008; SisterSong) – and it will continue to surface until the racism underpinning misogyny is dramatically transformed.
It is within this context that we read the accusations of Survivors of Abortion Holocaust. The allegations of the Short sisters only exist with the financial and moral support of the organized Christian conservative right. Outraged that Dr. Miller-Young defended themselves and their students, the right wing media machine had a whole symbolic repertoire of tropes and images to circulate against them It is only within this framework that the “rights” to property of a sign bearing grotesque and misrepresented images carry stronger moral valences than the people such images actually violate.
While it may be easier to condemn the conservative right for its deployment of white-supremacist, misogynist, and queer-phobic taunting and violation, this situation requires a more self-critical appraisal of the current state of feminist movements. How might we collectively challenge the complicities and saturations of racism that continue to permeate “free speech,” “the academy,” “activism,” “reproductive rights,” and “feminism”? What can situations like this teach us about the dire and profoundly unfinished work of anti-racist and queer feminisms as collective, emancipatory projects?
Since the 1990s, there has been an increase in conservative and neoliberal platforms at universities and colleges across the U.S. This coincides with the weakening of progressive political mobilization, rendering us all vulnerable, albeit in uneven, highly stratified ways. The downsizing and re-organization of the educational sector, alongside the continual swelling of the prison state and tax-funded instruments of war, has resulted in the hyper-privatization of our movements and a dwindling of radical critique. Within this context, a strong sense of our mutual survival and collective futures wears thin. As feminists indebted to earlier generations of collective struggle, we ask: How has the systematic backlash against the most radical variants of feminist of color and anti-racist collective movements provided the conditions of possibility for the charges against Dr. Miller-Young? How has the weakening of the left contributed to a series of disasters and vulnerabilities for progressive faculty, staff, and students? And what work must we do to constantly revitalize our commitments to collective anti-racist movements?
It is important to ask why the Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust were even at UCSB. At present, liberal conceptions of “free speech” dominate how we understand if a political group can or should be able to profess its message on university and college campuses. To be clear: we are not interested in defining which groups should or should not be present on campus. Rather, we question the process and patterns of which groups and which messages are presented as the norm on campus, and which are decidedly not. For instance, the Genocide Awareness Project (GAP) is an anti-abortion group that travels to university and college campuses across the U.S. promoting images of racial violence, likening abortion to lynching, the holocaust, and genocide of Native Americans. In 2012, University of Connecticut students were arrested for “trespassing” on “public” campus property when they protested and blocked the GAP's signs. The University responded by deciding that this was an issue of “free speech” for the GAP, and that students had trespassed because GAP had paid the appropriate vendor fees to be on campus. In this example, we are once again witness to the mass distortion of historical violence and its appropriation to meet conservative, white supremacist, xenophobic aims. We are witness to the collusion of profit-making with the political decisions over whose “rights” are counted.
As Jodi Melamed and Roderick Ferguson have recently argued, liberal claims to free speech and “academic freedom” must be situated “as part of a developing strategy within the U.S. to render certain knowledges impermissible.” Such incidents form part of a larger pattern whereby rights and protections for the intellectual and academic freedom of some are rendered hyper-visible, whereas others are systematically obscured. While beyond the scope of this essay, we see these dynamics at play through a slew of other cases at present. Evidenced everywhere, from the banning of Students for Justice in Palestine on Northeastern Univeristy's campus, to the recent firing of two feminist public intellectuals at Columbia University, we see the extent to which a liberal logic of rights and academic freedom is structurally organized to protect particular interests at the necessary expense of others. It is only within this framework that we read the allegations of Survivors of Abortion Holocaust.
In a recently released interview with Angela Davis in prison from the early 1970s (Black Power Mixtape, 1967-1975), a white European journalist asked Davis if they believe in “violence.” Them response brings into context certain fundamentals of U.S. history, and specifically the breathtaking ability of white supremacy and the U.S. state to constantly cover over its own violence, reproducing its defilement of life and liberty, instead as “innocence” and “victimhood.” First citing their experiences growing up in Birmingham, Alabama during an era of rampant anti-black violence, Davis turned the question on their interviewer, stating:
If you are a Black person and you live in the Black community all your life and walk out on the street everyday and see white police surrounding you…And then you ask me whether I approve of violence. Now that just doesn't make any sense at all.
Davis reveals the profound reversals of history that elide a white supremacist context, which are evidenced everywhere from rampant police brutality, to the prevalence white neighborhood vigilantes. Importantly, Davis challenges the perversions of truth that continually erase the fundamental violence of whiteness. Davis's astute comments demand accountability to these structural hierarchies of race, sexuality, class, and gender that are more pertinent than ever for us in 2014. The incident at UCSB presents us with another moment to expose the violence of whiteness and continue the struggle to eradicate it.
For all these reasons, we issue a radical call for accountability to questions of history, representation, and the racialized gendering of tropes of “culpability” and “innocence” when considering Dr. Miller-Young's case. Longstanding figures of black violence, such as those that we have discussed, cannot be disentangled from Dr. Miller-Young's case and its rapid uptake in the neo-conservative media-machine. Nor can it be disentangled from our accountabilities to building anti-racist anti-colonial queer feminist movements. The attack on Dr. Miller-Young must be located amidst the many against whom such tropes are marshaled when their mere existence threatens proper racial, gender and sexual hierarchies. The violence of whiteness will continue to be displaced onto communities of color until racism as a cornerstone of misogyny is truly transformed. For these reasons, we are in solidarity with Mireille Miller-Young.

A recent report from earlier this week claimed that Microsoft "hasn't given consumers much reason to renew Office." The CITEworld story, focused on Office 365 Home Premium, claimed that Microsoft has added almost no new features or functionality during the past year to the offering, making renewals less attractive.
While I personally consider additions like support for Office Mobile on iPhones and Android phones to count as a "feature," I think it's fair to say that Microsoft officials haven't made it clear what they've done to update the locally installable 2013 versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote that are part of Office Home Premium.
On the business side of the house, Microsoft execs also haven't said much in the past year about the updates and improvements they've made to the full suite of Office 2013 apps that those with an Office 365 Professional Plus (Office ProPlus) subscription have received over the past year.
But a January 21 Office IT Pro blog post (part one of a two parter) clarifies the "what did Microsoft do for me lately with Office" situation considerably.
First things first: What is Office 365 ProPlus? It's not a Web-based version of Office, but it is the full collection of Microsoft's Office apps -- Access, Excel, InfoPath, Lync, OneNote, Outlook, PowerPoint, Publisher and Word -- sold as a monthly Office 365 subscription. These apps all are meant to be installed on users' local computers using Microsoft's Click-to-Run technology. (Apps can be installed on up to five different computers with a single Office 365 license.)
The new January 21 post highlights a number of frequently asked questions about the Automatic Updates functionality in Office 365 ProPlus. Office 365 ProPlus is configured by default to automatically update monthly from the cloud and install updates when Office apps and processes aren't running.
A couple of highlights from the FAQ:
Microsoft is planning to provide SP1 for Office 2013 "Early 2014,"
The next "major" version of Office ("Office 16"?) also will be delivered to Office 365 ProPlus subscribers as a monthly build/update.
Each monthly build/update that Microsoft delivers automatically to Office 365 ProPlus users "may contain security updates, non-security updates, and functionality improvements." There's a list of changes that Microsoft made to each build on this Microsoft Support site. Microsoft will not allow separate security and non-security updates; they are intertwined -- something it sounds like a number of IT users have complained about, based on the FAQ.
All updates are cumulative, so each build contains all the other changes from previous builds.
Office 365 ProPlus updates are not provided via Windows Update.
Users can opt to test Office 365 ProPlus updates before approving them for deployment.
The full FAQ is worth a read.
Modern Romance in The Mindy Project
The hopeless romantics among us are facing a difficult time. After each failed date, each awkward encounter with the opposite sex, each well intentioned foray into the world of OKCupid, one can hear young, single people bemoaning the fact that “chivalry is dead,” cursing the hook-up culture of our society, and wondering what causes so many to actively avoid commitment and serious relationships. The dating landscape has shifted from serious to casual, and label-less relationships and no-strings-attached sex are wildly popular and even preferred by many. Open relationships are becoming a viable option for many, and online dating is no longer viewed as desperate and creepy, rather, it's now a strategy for casting a wider net. Adding to the confusion is the omnipresence of social media, which leads to miscommunications, jealousy, and the pressure to present oneself a certain way.
FOX's The Mindy Project tackles all of these issues and more. Starring Mindy Kaling as Dr. Mindy Lahiri, an OB/GYN working at a practice in New York City, it combines the dynamics of a workplace comedy with Mindy's seemingly endless quest to find love. Aspects of the current dating scene are presented in a humorous, ridiculous fashion, and Mindy's love life is typically a mess. After all, in the pilot episode, they cause drunken chaos at their ex-boyfriend's wedding, and that messy chaos never truly disappears.
Over the course of the series, Mindy ends up in plenty of cringe-worthy situations as they chase after the affections of various men, from accidentally hooking up with a male prostitute to starting a regretful secret relationship with a business competitor. While other shows often feature conventionally suave characters who are wildly successful when it comes to the opposite sex, it's refreshing to see a character that is somewhat awkward in the romance department, and even more refreshing to see a character that wholly embraces it, saying “I figure if I'm going to be a mess, I might as well be a hot mess.” Mindy's disastrous attempts at transforming their life into the romantic comedy they have always dreamed of living are highly relatable to those navigating the current dating scene, which seems to be characterized by the very same mishaps that Mindy experiences and odd situations they always happen to encounter.
Hook up culture
In the pilot episode, “The Mindy Project,” Mindy is hooking up with Dr. Jeremy Reed to distract themselves from the harsh reality of the break-up that she's distraught over. A common trend nowadays is the idea that “the best way to get over someone is to get under someone else.” Often, the goal is to avoid real “emotions” by engaging in strictly casual sex. Although this works for some, it's often a risky ploy, as the viewer sees when Mindy deals with the personal repercussions. They realize that is using their “relationship” with Dr. Reed as a crutch, and that sleeping with them is just a failed attempt at getting over their ex-boyfriend.
Other characters are active players in the casual hookup game, such as Mindy's friend and colleague turned love interest Danny Castellano and their former frat boy coworker Peter. Including Dr. Reed, most of the male characters display an interest in no-strings-attached “relationships,” often engaging in flings that last about an episode before pursuing something new.
Fear of Commitment
Multiple characters are notorious for their “commitment phobic” attitudes. Mindy's cheating ex-boyfriend Josh is a clear offender, but so is their former fiancée, Casey. Josh displays an inability to commit to one person. In Season 1, Episode 9 (“Josh and Mindy's Christmas Party”), Mindy finds a voicemail on Josh's phone from a woman named Heather, who is revealed to be a girlfriend who Josh did not break up with before they began dating Mindy. Casey, on the other hand, can't commit to a stable lifestyle. In Season 2, Episode 3 (“Music Festival”), Mindy realizes that they simply flit between careers-missionary, DJ, event planner-without considering how their lifestyle changes affect their future with them They seem to be caught in the same plight as many young people: what do I do with my life? Their decisions cause Mindy to break off their engagement.
Casual “relationships”
Our generation seems to live by the mantra “together, but not ‘together.'” People will act like boyfriend and girlfriend, but avoid putting a label on it until the last possible second-or not at all. Mindy and Danny struggle with this when they discuss their relationship in Season 2, Episode 18 (“Be Cool”). Danny tells Mindy to keep quiet about their relationship and “be cool” because they don't feel that they should tell everyone in the office that they're dating, and carefully avoids revealing that they have a girlfriend. Mindy tell themselves over and over that they can “be cool” for Danny, thinking that “Dating is fun. But dating in secret is really fun.” But it's hard to keep emotions in check when you're ready to throw yourself into a serious relationship, yet the other person isn't.
So many “label-less” relationships seem to pop up these days, as if both partners can simply avoid romantic feelings by also avoiding dirty words like “boyfriend” and “girlfriend.” But eschewing labels doesn't inherently protect you from heartbreak. In fact, it can often cause more anguish, as we see when Danny ends things with Mindy in the very same episode, saying they don't want a real relationship because they are scared of losing their best friend. As casual relationships and sex become more acceptable (and even celebrated), more and more people find themselves struggling with complicated transitions from friends to significant others.
Technology and Miscommunications
In one of the most hilariously realistic episodes of The Mindy Project, Season 2, Episode 8 (“You've Got Sext”), Peter and Morgan steal Mindy's phone and take this opportunity to sext their love interest, Cliff, a lawyer who works in the building. The texts appear across the screen so that the viewer is privy to “Dr. Lahiri's” (surprisingly successful) attempts at seducing Cliff. The texts start out with the simple question of “What are you wearing?” and the sexual tension escalates from there.
This episode is painfully true to life. The two plan out exactly how to present Mindy to Cliff: bold, extremely flirty, sexually confident. They want Mindy to appear as someone who Cliff will instantly fall for. They come up with one-liners after putting their heads and celebrate appropriately when Cliff responds to one particularly raunchy text with a winking smiley face. Their ploys illustrate the issues that social media presents us with: how do we choose to portray ourselves to the world? What should we play up? What should we hide? What do we feel comfortable saying behind the protection of a glowing screen that we could never reveal in person?
Oftentimes, people are initially successful at creating a positive image for themselves online, and are able to cater to exactly what they think other people want them to be. But the problem arises once you start getting to know others in person, when you can no longer hide behind the façade that you crafted-what if they don't like what they see when your true colors start to show?
Peter and Morgan definitely capture Cliff's interest, and they and Mindy begin a serious relationship. But they ultimately end up going separate ways due to more trials that social media adds to the dating scene.
Jealousy
Cliff and Mindy eventually break up in Season 2, Episode 13 (“L.A.”) because they see a photo of them with Casey at a party in Los Angeles. They happened to run into them after promising Cliff that they wouldn't see him, so naturally, this upsets Cliff. But they won't accept their explanation: Cliff is a divorce attorney, and feels more cautious than most because of this. They break up with them because they feel that they violated their trust, and they don't know how to bring that back. What we see on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram isn't always the whole story, and when we take it as such, we do ourselves a disservice by ignoring the truth. This can result in ending a relationship due to jealousy over what we see online.
Television shows like The Mindy Project remind us that we are not alone when we end up in screwy, unsatisfying romantic situations. Mindy may seem to get knocked down every time they turn a corner, but they always get back up again to continue seeking the love that they know is out there. Dating can be discouraging, but The Mindy Project allows us to laugh at that discouragement and reminds us that if all else fails, at least we have a funny story to tell.

Another disturbing incident of alleged animal cruelty in Kilkenny City has been reported to Gardai today.
The incident happened at the Canal Walk at about 7am this morning. Local artist Eoghan O' Driscoll says they were sitting just down from Canal Square at the castle wall, when they heard yelping and a loud 'whack'.
Only a few feet away, a black dog - possibly part-lurcher - was on the ground dead. Mr O' Driscoll says the dog appeared to have been thrown from above.
A number of people nearby gathered around, shocked by what had happened. Gardai were immediately called to the scene, where they took statements from witnesses and removed the animal's body.
There is hope that CCTV in the area may provide further information on exactly what took place this morning.
It comes after a number of incidents in recent weeks which have put animal welfare under the spotlight in Kilkenny.
If the Chicago White Sox are indeed willing to listen to offers for their outstanding lefty starter, Chris Sale, the Cardinals need to be on the other end of that conversation. I know the Cards like to talk about their depth at starting pitching, and the emergence of their top prospect Alex Reyes, and the return of Lance Lynn, and how they'll have approximately 217 candidates to fill the five rotation spots — OK, a slight exaggeration.
But here's what St. Louis doesn't have: a true “A” No. 1, a king of the hill, a top of the heap starter. I'm channeling Sinatra here, but you get the point.
Carlos Martinez is a near ace, but they aren't there yet. And unless Adam Wainwright can turn back time and do 2013 or 2014 all over again, he's a good pitcher that you love having in the rotation — but no longer a No. 1 in the classic sense. Reyes is an exciting, legitimately imposing talent. But he's young and raw and inexperienced and there's no way of knowing how long it will take them to evolve into a finished product. Mike Leake is a ground-ball pitcher who will post improved baseball-card stats as soon as the Cardinals upgrade their shoddy defense.
We like Lynn, the big-man, and let's not forget that between 2012 and 2015 they ranked among the top 25 starters in the majors in starts, innings, quality starts, strikeouts, pitcher wins, and ERA.
Only 13 pitchers had more quality starts than the underrated Lynn over those four seasons — before they were lost to elbow surgery in 2016 — and it will be great to see them going after hitters again. But is they an ace? No. He's damned good, but not a No. 1.
This is a fine collection of starters — and no, I didn't name all of them — with plenty of upsides in El Gallo (Martinez), Reyes, and some other lively arms in the system that are on the way to St. Louis. But I don't see a Corey Kluber, a Madison Bumgarner, or even a Jon Lester. Someone that instills pure confidence in their team, and the fans, when you hand them the baseball for a hugely important start. After inexplicably declining to pursue Max Scherzer in free agency before 2015, and then coming up short in the dollars in their bid for David Price last offseason, the Cardinals aren't equipped with a heavy rotation hammer. You don't need one to win or go far, but it sure helps the cause.
Sale turns 28 at the end of March. They have three seasons remaining on their contract at an average salary of just over $13.1 million. Over the past five seasons they rank tied for sixth among MLB starters in quality starts (109), seventh in ERA (3.04), fifth in strikeouts per nine innings (10.02), third in strikeout-walk ratio (5.08), eighth in the fewest baserunners per nine innings, and fourth in the fewest walks/hits per inning (1.06.)
The price for Sale will be high — enormous, actually. And maybe even prohibitive, unless a trade partner is willing to capitulate to every outrageous Chisox demand. I would be surprised if the White Sox do anything more than listen to what teams are willing to offer for Sale. And if the White Sox are genuinely willing to deal Sale on their terms, he'll attract intense interest.
The Cardinals are rich with pitching prospects and could probably put an enticing package together. But I'd imagine Cardinals GM John Mozeliak would draw the line at including Reyes in this or any potential deal, so that alone could take them out of the running for a pitcher of Sale's caliber. This could be nothing more than the usual, media-driven, offseason fantasy. But if the White Sox are serious about this, the Cardinals have to join the conversation. When the Cardinals won the World Series in 2006 and 2011, they rode their ace, Chris Carpenter. The Cardinals have plenty of solid starters, good starters — but no one that fits the Carp profile.

Redbird Rejects Ep. 31 – Best Ballparks, Vegas Half Marathon, and Cardinals Hot Stove Talk

Bills head coach Chan Gailey was asked if they would consider coaching changes in the bye week following the loss to the Titans Sunday and they gave a quick and terse response of ‘No.' Monday morning in their weekly appearance on Bills flagship station WGR Sportsradio 550 they explained why.
Gailey said in all their years of coaching it's not the way they operate.
“You don't do that midseason in my opinion,” said Gailey. “You don't do that. Everybody has got an opinion about that I understand that. That's just the way I do business. I don't believe that's the right way to do business. That's a non-issue for me. Are we constantly evaluating everything? We're not going to make a change like that at this point in the season. It's not like you just flip a switch and things automatically get different. You've got to evaluate.”

Wisconsin state senator Glenn Grothman (R-West Bend) wants women to know that the whole concept of wage discrimination is all in their heads. “It's an underreported problem,” Grothman told The Daily Beast, “but a huge number of discrimination claims are baseless. Most of them are filed by fired employees, and really today almost anybody is a protected class.”
It was this rationale that led the senator to spearhead the drive to repeal Wisconsin's 2009 Equal Pay Enforcement Act, the state's equivalent of the Ledbetter Act, the federal law that helped provide the means for workers to pursue discrimination claims against employers.
Governor Scott Walker (R) signed the repeal of the Equal Pay Enforcement Act into law on Thursday. The repeal, now known as Act 219, was brought before Walker after passing in party-line votes in the Republican-dominated state senate and state assembly.
One of the authors of the Equal Pay Enforcement Act, Democratic state senator Christine Sinicki (Milwaukee) said of Act 219, “This whole (legislative) session has been anti-woman and anti-middle class, and this fits right in with that agenda.”
Grothman dismisses the idea that the original legislation was even necessary. They said that the Equal Pay Enforcement Act imposed an untenable burden on businesses, and that the reason women make less than men in the workplace has less to do with bias than with women's decision to prioritize child-rearing over their careers.
They told the Beast, “Take a hypothetical husband and wife who are both lawyers, but the husband is working 50 or 60 hours a week, going all out, making 200 grand a year. The woman takes time off, raises kids, is not go go go. Now they're 50 years old. The husband is making 200 grand a year, the woman is making 40 grand a year. It wasn't discrimination. There was a different sense of urgency in each person.”
Citing the writings of right-wing provocateur and frequent talk-show guest Ann Coulter as evidence, Grothman claimed that when “you break it down by married and unmarried, the differential disappears.”
Fatima Goss Graves, vice president for education and employment at the National Women's Law Center beged to differ. Citing “study after study,” Graves said, “The idea that pay discrimination is a myth is a myth in and of itself.”
According to The Daily Beast, “A 2007 study by the American Association of University Women found that college-educated women earn only 80 percent as much as similarly educated men a year after graduation.”
After ten years in the workforce, the gap opened to 12 percent.
Prior to the passage of the Equal Pay Enforcement Act, Wisconsin had a larger gap than the national average between the wages of male and female workers. By the time the law was repealed on Thursday, the gap had shrunken to lower than the national average.
“Since the law was put into place, employers actually took notice and were very conscious of the fact that they had to follow this law or they were at risk of a lawsuit,” said Democratic senator Sinicki.
Governor Scott Walker and four other state Republicans will be facing historic recall elections in June.

Trump's Draft Proposal Makes Tweaks To NAFTA
The Trump administration is gearing up for a rework of the NAFTA treaty between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Thursday the administration hopes to soon start the 90-day countdown clock to opening talks. A letter circulating on Capitol Hill suggests the administration may take a less extreme approach to negotiations than expected.
During the election campaign President Trump threatened to pull out of NAFTA, which they called the worst trade deal in U.S. history. But, a draft outline of the U.S. objectives from the Trade Representative's office suggests a more temperate approach, including goals on investment and labor that have enjoyed bipartisan support. Jeffrey Schott, of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says the letter provides the basis for constructive negotiations. But, Schott says, "It also contains a few seeds that could poison those talks and disrupt and perhaps blow up those negotiations."
Among those "seeds" is a reference to tax fairness that could foreshadow conflict over the border taxes Trump has threatened to impose on Mexico, or the Border Adjustable tax supported by the House leadership that would levy a 20 percent tax on all imports.
Ross described the letter as "the very broad outlines of the topics we will be discussing." Ross said it did not represent a change in the administration's thinking.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee asked the government ethics watchdog on Monday to review comments by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin plugging “The Lego Batman Movie,” a film one of their companies produced, for a possible ethics violation.
In a letter to Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub, Senator Ron Wyden said they were concerned that Mnuchin had violated their ethics agreement signed in January in their comments on Friday at the end of a live interview with the Axios news website.
Mnuchin had agreed to divest their interests in Ratpac-Dune Entertainment Holdings LLC within 120 days of their confirmation, and “not participate personally and substantially in any matter that has a direct and predictable effect on the financial interests of the entity” unless first obtaining a waiver.
RatPac-Dune, co-founded by Mnuchin with producer-director Brett Rattner and media billionaire James Packer, has produced and financed a number of Hollywood hits in recent years, including “Avatar,” “Mad Max: Fury Road” and “The Lego Batman Movie.”
At the Axios event, Mnuchin was asked in a question from a reader for a movie recommendation.
“I'm not allowed to promote anything that I'm involved in. So I just want to have the legal disclosure, you've asked me the question, and I am not promoting any product,” Mnuchin said. “But you should send all your kids to ‘Lego Batman.'”
The comment drew laughter from the audience at the Washington event.
Wyden said the Finance Committee had received no notifications regarding Mnuchin's holdings in RatPac-Dune and assumed the Treasury chief still held that interest.
“I am concerned that Sec. Mnuchin's comments, may be seen to have a predictable effect on the financial interests” of RatPac-Dune, Wyden said in their letter.

In a statement, a Treasury spokesperson said: “As their statement reflects, the Secretary clearly recognized that they generally may not promote private interests and specifically gave the legal disclosure that they were not promoting a movie, but answering a question they were asked directly.”
The OGE recommended last month that the White House should consider disciplinary action against President Donald Trump's adviser Kellyanne Conway for their on-air comment on Fox News Channel promoting the clothing and jewelry line of Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump. Conway said people “should go buy Ivanka's stuff.”
The White House later told the ethics watchdog that Conway had acted “inadvertently” and without “nefarious motive or intent to benefit personally.”

Psychologist Stephen Johnson writes that the narcissist is someone who has “buried their true self-expression in response to early injuries and replaced it with a highly developed, compensatory false self.”(1) This alternate persona to the real self often comes across as grandiose, “above others,” self-absorbed, and highly conceited. In our highly individualistic and externally driven society, mild to severe forms of narcissism are not only pervasive but often encouraged.
Narcissism is often interpreted in popular culture as a person who's in love with them or herself. It is more accurate to characterize the pathological narcissist as someone who's in love with an idealized , which they project in order to avoid feeling (and being seen as) the real, disenfranchised, wounded self.(1)(2) Deep down, most pathological narcissists feel like the “ugly duckling,” even if they painfully don't want to admit it.
Narcissists frequently employ a variety of deceits in order to get what they want. Since, deep down, they don't believe their real selves are worthy, scheming and manipulation are resorted to in order to succeed.(3)(4)
Below are eight common lies and exaggerations narcissists often use to “pull one over” people, with references from my book (click on title): “How to Successfully Handle Narcissists”. While some people may be of these mechanizations from time to time, a chronic narcissist will show a habitual pattern of several of the following deceits, while remaining oblivious to (or unconcerned with) how these falsehoods affect others.
1. “I'm So Great – Just Ask Me!”
Multiple studies and writings have linked chronic narcissism with the tendency to overinflate one's own sense of the self.(3)(4)(5)(6)(7) This is frequently accomplished through bragging, showboating, exaggerating, name-dropping, and other forms of self-aggrandizement. On a regular basis, the narcissist will remind you how special, important, powerful, attractive, popular, and/or successful they are. They exhibit a constant need to talk about (display) themselves in flattering and egotistical ways, with frequent reminders of their superior and -worthy dispositions.
Deep down, however, the true of the narcissist may be a very different reality. They may feel that they are nothing without the aggrandizement, empty without the , and unloved without the adulation. The narcissist's superficial bragging betrays an inability to be simply and genuinely human, with the capacity to engage in equitable and authentic relationships.

2. “I'm Better Than You / I'm Better Than Them!”
“It's not easy being superior to everyone I know.”
― Anonymous narcissist
Related to the trait of grandiosity is superiority. The Mayo Clinic identifies “believing that you are superior” and “expecting to be recognized as superior” as two prominent characteristics of .(8) In daily interactions, narcissists take satisfaction in reminding you and others that they're better in large and small ways. Their barely disguised (or nakedly undisguised) intolerance of “inferiors” is revealed through judgments, criticisms, smugness, sarcasm, marginalization, stereotypes, and overall high condescension. In the mind-set of some narcissists, they are gods and goddesses, and the world revolves around them. From their self-absorbed perspective, they deserve the privilege of being catered to, and other people's thoughts and feeling are irrelevant.(5)(9)
As Johnson pointed out in their definition of the narcissist, this conceited self-image is merely a well-rehearsed disguise, concocted to hide the narcissist's inferiority complex. As the saying goes: “Misery loves company.” Since the narcissist is incapable of feeling good about them or themselves independently, they need to put others down in order to make themselves feel better.(1)(2)
“Some people try to be tall by off the heads of others.”
— Paramhansa Yogananda
3. “I Promise!”
Another common trait of the chronic narcissist is their or their pattern of not following through on agreements and obligations. This can range from the relatively mild, such as flaking out on appointments and tasks, to the highly serious, such as abandoning major responsibilities and relationships (commitments). Being self-centered and conceited, the narcissist will generally meet their or their obligations only when they suit their self-interest. Chronic narcissists do not relate, they use. They talk a good talk, but often fail to back it up. Research and writings have linked high narcissism with traits such as unreliability, , manipulativeness, and overall lower levels of trustworthiness.(3)(4)(5)(10)(11)
4. “Don't Worry!”
Since many narcissists care little about rules and boundaries, they may engage in activities which lack credibility, ethics, or . Examples may include smaller offenses such as breaking traffic rules, cutting in line, borrowing items without returning, or stealing office supplies, to more serious schemes such as financial, legal, or relational abuse. Some narcissists not only engage in, but thrive on rule breaking to get their way, for rule breaking makes them feel exceptional and entitled. When you question the narcissist on their tactics and express concern, they're quick to retort with well-rehearsed excuses, with deceptively persuasive assurances that “everything is going to be okay” – until it's not.
“I take pride in persuading people to give me exceptions to their rules.”
― Anonymous narcissist
“Rules are meant to be broken – that's how you WIN.”
― Anonymous narcissist
5. “It's Not My Fault / It's Your Fault!”
Inevitably, the self-absorbed and manipulative machinations of a chronic narcissist will catch up with them or him, and land the narcissist in hot water. When this occurs, one of the most common responses of the narcissist is to point fingers, and shift responsibility to others. Oftentimes, the narcissist will blame their victims for having caused their own victimization. Another common response is making excuses - there is always some unexpected or unforeseen circumstance which deterred the narcissist from being responsible. Finally, the narcissist may make themselves out to be the victim, pointing to any number of difficulties and hard-luck struggles which prevented them from being accountable, and ask for leniency (again being an exception to the rule). All of the manipulative devices above serve to shift scrutiny and responsibility away from the narcissist, so that them or their weaknesses, deficiencies, and failings can remain hidden.(3)(12)
“It's not our fault that we misplaced your check. You should have called to make sure it wasn't misfiled.”
― Anonymous bank manager
6. “I'm Here for You / I Care About You / I Love You!”
Narcissists have the ability to be charming and when they choose.(13) Like a master salesperson, they know how to say the right things to entice your attention, and steer you into believing their sugar-coated ­persuasions. In interpersonal and/or , narcissists are often quick to profess their admiration of and for you, usually without bothering to really know you as a person. In reality, the narcissist wants you to feel special not because they really care about you, but because they want something from you. Sweet talk is a form of emotional manipulation calculated to seduce and exploit. In romance, the narcissist is often more enamored with the seduction process than they or they are with you, for you represent a “conquest” to them. Like a master con artist, they will hook you in, get what they want, and then leave you hanging out to dry. You're left picking up the tattered relational pieces, perhaps wondering whether YOU did something wrong.
7. “You're Not Here for Me / You Disappoint Me!”
“I've decided to my wife. After three years of , they haven't met the performance criteria I've set. I'm very disappointed in her.”
― Anonymous narcissist
Pathological narcissists often demand constant attention and sacrifices from those around them, for such placating makes them feel important. When someone in the narcissist's manipulative orbit has the courage to be independent and chooses them or their own priority, the narcissist will often become highly agitated, sometimes fly into a (narcissistic) , and accuse the other person of being “selfish”, “disappointing”, or “not here for me”. In reality, the narcissist is simply throwing a child-like tantrum for not getting their or their way. If you find yourself on the receiving end of these accusations, ask yourself the following questions:
Am I being treated with genuine respect?
Are this person's expectations & demands of me reasonable?
Is the giving in this relationship primarily one way?
Ultimately, do I feel good about myself in this relationship?
If one or more of your answers to the questions above are in the negative, the truth may be that the narcissist is actually the one who's not there for you.
8. “I'm Sorry / l'll Change.”
Because narcissists often operate on inauthenticity and falsehoods, the consequences of their actions may eventually catch up to them, and exact a heavy price. These are the moments of life-crisis for the narcissist, which may include family estrangement, marital separation or , trouble with the law, damaged personal and/or professional reputation, etc.
During these moments, some narcissists will dramatically profess their wrong-doing, promise to change their ways, and ask for . They may sound convincing, and perhaps even believe in the contrition themselves. But be very careful! Johnson warns that when many narcissists enter as the result of life crisis, it is not for the purpose of fundamentally changing their pathology, but only to affect crisis .(1)(2) Often, as soon as the crisis is over, they'll go back to their Machiavellian ways. When a narcissist says “I'll change”, what they or they often want is for the unpleasant situation to go away, without changing himself.
Can a narcissist really change for the better? Perhaps. But only if they or they are highly aware, and willing to go through the courageous process of self-discovery. For narcissists no longer willing to play the charade at the cost of genuine relationships and credibility, there are ways to liberate from falsehood, and progressively move toward one's Higher Self.

It is time to repeal the FCRA Act, 2010, indeed, though not in the manner that our civil society and NGOs deem fit.
The FCRA Act, 2010, defines disclosure rules for non-profit organizations that accept funds from abroad for activities that they deem to be for the benefit of Indian society and democracy.
A recent article has argued for much greater leeway to non-profits to accept funds from abroad and argues for little or no oversight. Any oversight is to be provided by a voluntary organization composed of actors from civil society themselves.
This argument is made out of the two assertions that political parties themselves accept funds from abroad and terms any Government's denial of license to accept foreign funds as an assault on democratic freedoms.
Here we make an argument to repeal the FCRA and simply ban any entity from accepting funds from outside India for non-profit activities, both NGOs and Section-25 companies.
Why does FCRA need to go?
Foreign funding for NGOs has the following impacts:
Subvert the democratic processes of law-making and law enforcement. ‘He who pays the piper calls the tune', as the saying goes
Weaken the Government's standing in implementation of policies and laws.
Weaken native Indian control over educational and social services.
Hamper economic growth
ecological and social justice grounds, but could be directed by foreign forces inimical to the Indian Republic.
The disclosure norms were put in place to improve transparency and for tracking of funds. NGOs have circumvented this rule by accepting funds in the name of a single entity, a ‘control organization', and further disbursed funds to unregistered organizations.
Funds can be collected only for research, training, awareness, rehabilitation and relief for victims of human-made and natural calamities, maintenance of buildings and real estate for philanthropic activities.
Independent analysis has revealed that nearly Rs 6000 crores have been amassed as cash and cash equivalents and for acquisition of vast tracts of real estate.
Investigation also has revealed that foreign funding has intervened extensively in legislative actions, through the PIL route.
Examples are those of lobbying against the Himachal Pradesh Anti-Conversion Law, lobbying against traditional practices such as Jallikattu, Kambala, temple elephant in the name of animal rights, prisoner visit boards, lobbying for self-regulation by FCRA NGOs, Article 377, challenging appointments to Central Vigilance Commission. Women's Power Connect, a high-powered American political entity that has advocated and lobbied for gender-specific laws in India.
Foreign NGOs have also intervened in the executive, like establishment of Childline support. Several members of the National Advisory Council, an extra-constitutional body established by the UPA Government to steer the course of Government, had many high-ranking appointees with leadership positions in foreign-funded NGOs.
The best solution is to not allow foreign funding for non-commercial activities, since the entire sum can be raised within the country itself. Remittances for non-profit activities has never been more than US $2 billion pa. In a US $ 2 trillion economy, this quantum of money can be raised through domestic sources, without having to compromise on national self-respect and sovereignty.
The outlay for CSR spending is already Rs 5000 crores per annum, which is comparable to FCRA funds of Rs 7500 crore.
Critical changes that can be proposed to the funding
A public body, comprised of representatives from the Executive Government, members of Opposition from Central and State Legislatures, Judiciary, including retired Judges, religious and socio-cultural representatives can be appointed for the purpose of routing CSR funds to NGOs, with due diligence as to their nature and purposes.
All foreign funds must be paid to this body for further disbursal to NGOs.
This will eliminate the need for FCRA registrations, approvals, renewals and regular returns. Instead, we can have a situation where foreign money is disbursed to NGOs and Section-25 companies on the basis of the recipients applying for funds from a common pool administered by an independent public body.
These vegan quinoa and black bean Stuffed Bell Peppers are healthy and tasty and spiced with biryani masala. Great for gluten-free diets. Here's an easy recipe that is perfect for weekdays or weekends, as an appetizer or an entree. It's packed with protein, incredibly good for you, and — icing on the cake — it's fat-free. Plus, it has a delicious Indian twist to it. My Stuffed Bell Peppers with biryani masala.
Biryani masala is a spice mix that you can buy off the shelf at any Indian grocery store, or you can try making it at home. As the name suggests, it is the spice mix used to flavor biryanis, but nobody wrote a rule book saying that's all you can use it for. In fact, biryani masala can be delicious in sides, subzis and — in this case– it can work its magic into an already flavorsome dish to make it absolutely sublime.
I wanted a recipe that was really healthy but also really filling, so I made my stuffing with a mix of black beans — star antioxidants — and quinoa, the perfect grain. I added into the mix some mushrooms and onions and then flavored it all up with the biryani masala. This is a recipe that's as simple and easy as it's healthy and delicious. In fact, the oven does most of the work.
If you're into grilling rather than baking in the summer (and I can totally understand if you are), this quinoa and black bean stuffed bell peppers are perfect for the grill. Stuff 'em, throw 'em on the grill, and cover them until the bottoms are nice and roasted. Plus, you'll have that great, smoky grilled flavor that will have every carnivore in the vicinity eyeing you with envy.
Here's that recipe for quinoa and black bean stuffed bell peppers. Enjoy!

While the top 3 bitcoin exchanges are still being scrutinized by PBOC since January, a recent report of money laundry case via bter has raised concern for regulatory compliance issues in altcoin exchanges.
The author, a lawyer in Beijing, disclosed a case using bitcoin as money laundry tools to stress the importance of AML on bitcoin exchanges and a reminder for authorities of capital flight.
The suspects come from Bingyang, a small city notorious for telecom frauds in Guangxi province. There are constant demands for money laundry. With some self-education online, Xu, the laundry dealer, figured out how to clean money via bitcoin exchanges. Xu managed to hook up with Xiao, who was a committed criminal for a series of telecom crimes. They managed to pull off two jobs, laundering a total of 5.424 million RMB(~790k USD at spot rate) . The usual flow is that Xiao pull off the trick and ask the victim to wire money into the bank cards provided by Xu. Then Xu and other suspects use the funds to buy bitcoin, which will be withdrawn to their local wallet. Then the coins are converted into cash via exchanges or underground bank. Exchange mentioned in the case is “bter” and two cases happened around mid 2014.
The suspects acquired around 1,200 btc via bter exchange with the ill-gotten 5 million RMB in August, 2014. Then the bitcoin was converted into cash via underground bank in Macau. Xu and two others claimed 360,000 RMB each as payback. The suspects have been convicted guilty of criminal charges, sentence of which was not revealed.
It's the first time that such money laundry case being disclosed via mainstream media. Just like the site-inspection to the major bitcoin exchanges, similar reports claiming that the bitcoin was a underground channel for capital flight were often spotted on the internet.
Bter lost 50 million NXT in August 2014 and another 7,170 BTC in Feb 2015 . Bitbank later released a statement to endorse the continuous operation of bter by funds injection. However, the endorsement doesn't help much to restore faith among users, especially when there are other options in the market.
Currently the 3 altcoin exchanges in China that has been in operation since 2013 are Yuanbao, Btc38 and Jubi. BTC38 lost 1.5 million RMB worth of coins in 2016 but users seemed unaffected. In terms of ID verification, BTC38 sticks to the C1-C3 ID authentication policy. C3, the top level account, user may deposit or withdraw up to 2 million RMB a month. Beijing-based Yuanbao upgraded identity authentication policy on 7th Jan 2017, asking users to upload ID pictures or download Taiyi Creditid App to comply with new verification requirement. Otherwise withdrawal would be suspended. It also claims the new system has successfully prevented a theft case.
It's worth noting that BTC38 allows 0 transaction fee for enterprise accounts, Yuanbao has 0.2-0.3% transaction fee while Jubi follows 0-0.1% fee policy. There are other altcoin exchanges in China, like Yunbi, Bichuang etc.
More tributes were held in Philadelphia Sunday for the victims of the deadly Paris attacks, including a vigil at the French International School in Center City. (Published Sunday, Nov. 15, 2015)
Cities nationwide, including Philadelphia, stood united behind France Saturday as the country reeled from the deadly terrorist rampage in Paris late Friday that left at least 129 dead and 352 others wounded.
Philly Buildings Light Up for Paris
A vigil organized by the Consulate General of France in Philadelphia as well as several French cultural and civic groups was held at 8 p.m. Saturday at Love Park in Center City. Organizers said the purpose of the event is to “show support and solidarity” for Paris.
During the vigil attendees sang the French national anthem. Many people in the crowd have strong ties to France and vowed to stand with the country.
"Show our strength against these people who are monsters, savages, who have no respect for human life," said Alexander Cramer, who grew up in France.
Another separate vigil for Paris took place at Love Park around 6 p.m. Saturday, according to the “Stand with Paris, Philly Love” Facebook page.
Another vigil took place Sunday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. at the French International School of Philadelphia on 150 N. Highland Avenue in Bala Cynwyd.
Several buildings in Philadelphia also lit up in the colors of the French flag in a tribute to Paris, including the Lit Brothers building on 8th and Market streets.
About 100 taxi drivers gathered outside Parliament this morning to protest changes to taxi stands at Wellington Airport.
Cabs involved in the protest include drivers from the ACE Taxis, Kiwi Cabs, Wellington Taxis 2005, Amalgamated Taxis, Harbour City Taxis, Choice Taxis, Supreme Taxis and Dial-a-Cab.
The drivers are protesting a deal done by the airport and Wellington Combined Taxis to give that company a preferential pick-up zone at the airport from July 1.
A spokesperson for about 300 cab drivers owned and operated by the smaller companies, Logan Pithyou, said drivers would be protesting each morning this week between 7am and midday.
"They'll be driving between the airport and Parliament. We just want to highlight the fact there are a lot of people who will be locked out.
"Many of them are already looking at signing up for the dole. Their livelihoods depend on them being able to pick people up from the airport. It's not good for these people."
No one from Wellington Airport was available for comment.
Divend Prasad, a Wellington taxi driver, said they were beeping their horn as part of the protest and was given a $150 ticket by police.
They said they were told they would end up in jail if they did it again.
Mr Prasad was a registered high school maths and science teacher in their native Fiji.
Unable to get work as a teacher in New Zealand, they resorted to driving a taxi, they said.
Fellow taxi driver Vonrick Kerr said the changes at the airport were the "straw that broke the camel's back".
The prime taxi rank spots were going to those with deep pockets, they said.
"The shallow pocket area is the back where we're not going to get any work at all and we feel that's an injustice."
The airport was partly council-owned so taxi drivers, as ratepayers, should be able to earn a living there, Mr Kerr said.

Following a banner year for Chicago technology companies in 2014, 2015 had a lot to live up to in terms of funding and exit dollars secured.
Even still, Chicago's digital tech companies had what seems to be the city's most successful year ever. In total, more than 140 Chicagoland tech companies received funding, collectively raising more than $1.7 billion in capital, funding and debt financing. That number is up 8.6 percent from 2014.
Dollars from exit events also increased in 2015, with about 40 companies exiting in 2015 for more than $8.2 billion — and that's without a single IPO lending any weight to final totals. Those numbers are also up from the previous year, a 19 percent increase buttressed by high-profile acquisitions like HERE Technologies View Profile Follow (which sold to a trio of German carmakers for $3 billion) and Merge Healthcare (which sold to IBM for $1 billion), both of which were announced during the first week of August.
Numbers like these are a good sign for Chicago tech companies, who tend to offer a bit more substance to investors than their peers on either coast — and often, for less.
"Each year since 2009, Chicago seems to have another ‘best year ever,'” said J.B. Pritzker, managing partner and founder of venture capital investment firm the Pritzker Group. “The Chicago tech scene matured in 2015 with very impressive capital raises and exits, and I expect that will continue in 2016 and beyond.”
Regardless of how 2016 unfolds, it's safe to say Chicago has cemented itself as a leader in tech, innovation, and talent, and not just in the Midwest.
“There's now a national recognition that Chicago has very fertile ground for technology entrepreneurs, investors and engineers,” Pritzker added.
Funding breakdown
The highest funded industry in 2015 was marketing, advertising, and social media, with 20 tech companies receiving funding in that vertical. Collectively, they raised about $110 million, led by large turns from both edo View Profile Follow ($20 million) and Centro View Profile We are hiring The Chicago Loop is a great place to work, located in a central area of Chicago accessible to major public transportation, dining and shopping. ($30 million).
However, FinTech continued to dominate in terms of sheer dollars raised. Twelve FinTech companies (several of which raised more than one round in 2015) worked to bring in more than $800 million dollars to the industry.
Avant View Profile We are hiring Located on Chicago's scenic Riverwalk. It's home to nearby trendy restaurants, a thriving startup community, and public transportation. alone provided $664 million of this year's total. The online personal loan provider registered the city's highest recorded funding — a massive Series E clocking in at $325 million — and brought in an additional $339 million in debt financing. By year's end, Avant had already announced plans to hire an additional 600 employees over the course of 2016.
, another personal loan provider, saw a $75 million debt financing round of its own. Meanwhile, companies like Raise View Profile Follow ($62 million), SMS Assist View Profile We are hiring ($45 million), Uptake View Profile We are hiring We are located in River North just right off the Chicago Brown Line stop. We also provide you with a free shuttle service to/from Ogilvie and Union. ($45 million), and VillageMD View Profile We are hiring We are in the heart of downtown Chicago - accessible to all trains and plenty of food/drink options nearby! ($36 million) led the pack for venture capital across the board.
2015 was also a big year for private equity investments, seeing companies like Rightpoint View Profile We are hiring bring in $55 million from New York-based private equity fund Stella Point Capital. One of Chicago's largest bootstrapped companies ever, e-discovery software leader Relativity View Profile We are hiring We're a community of passionate, life-long learners tackling challenging problems.

“2015 was a historic year for kCura,” said kCura CEO Andrew Sieja. “We hit our lofty growth targets and grew our operational footprint by adding 85 new employees and expanding internationally into 40 countries. Most importantly, we continued to work hard for our customers by delivering a great product and service. 2016 will be another memorable year, and we're excited for what's to come.”
Chicago's growing stable of unicorns
Until 2015, only one Chicago-based company could boast a valuation of one billion dollars or more: Mu Sigma Inc. View Profile Follow , an early pioneer of big data analytics based out of Northbrook. Since 2015's close, however, three additional companies have been welcomed to one of the tech industry's most exclusive club.
Alongside the announcement of their Series E in September, Avant also announced it had officially become the city's second company to boast the mythical moniker after receiving a valuation of almost $2 billion.
Uptake followed in Avant's breakneck footsteps, making tremendous strides to become one of Chicago's most highly-valued startups. Despite having launched in just 2014, Uptake burst onto the national scene with a $45 million round in October, which was enough to earn the data analytics company a billion-dollar valuation and a spot at the summit of Forbes' hottest startup of the year list.
Following a capital restructuring deal valued at $1.4 billion in November, ExteNet Systems View Profile Follow was the final Chicago tech company to reach unicorn status in 2015.
Major acquisitions, yesterday and tomorrow
But those are far from the only Chicago tech companies flirting with a billion-dollar valuation. Companies like Coyote Logistics View Profile Follow and Trustwave View Profile Follow likely could have received similar valuations had they not been acquired first. Coyote Logistics sold to UPS for $1.8 billion, and Singapore-based Singtel wrote a $770 million check to pick up Trustwave, a software security company. Other companies like Orbitz (which went to Expedia for $1.3 billion) and Cleversafe (an IBM acquisition with undisclosed terms) also contributed to the year's major exit events.
These numbers only account for digital tech companies headquartered in Cook, Lake, and DuPage counties. Some local tech juggernauts like Highland Park's SteelBrick View Profile Follow (which is technically headquartered out of San Mateo, California) were excluded, despite having one of the most striking showings in Chicago of last year. The company raised $18 million in February, an additional $48 million by October, and ended the year strong on a $360 million acquisition by Salesforce. Hardware manufacturers, pharmaceutical tech and IT service providers were also not included.
