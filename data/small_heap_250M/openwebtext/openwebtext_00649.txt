Brazil's threatened indictment of Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG) executives after offshore oil leaks shows that regulators from the North Sea to the Indian Ocean are stepping up scrutiny after BP Plc's 2010 disaster.
Brazilian authorities have said they may prosecute employees, shut operations and exact more than $10 billion in fines after the leaks at the Frade field 230 miles (370 kilometers) off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. The spill occurred 19 months after an explosion in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 workers and triggered the biggest offshore U.S. oil spill.
Governments around the world are paying closer attention to how energy explorers drill into high-pressure deposits of crude and natural gas as much as 8 miles beneath the sea surface. Chevron's Brazil incident took place after a ConocoPhillips (COP) leak in China and prior to what may be Nigeria's biggest spill in a decade at a Royal Dutch Shell Plc facility.
“There's been just such a rash of them that governments have got to act tough” with oil companies, Allen Brooks, a managing director at energy-investment bank PPHB LP in Houston and Chevron shareholder, said in a phone interview. Since the BP accident “every spill after that is heightened in terms of media attention and obviously government concern.”
ConocoPhillips was criticized by the People's Daily, China's Communist Party newspaper, for “negligence, cover-ups and cheating” in its handling of a June leak in Bohai Bay. Premier Wen Jiabao ordered a “thorough” investigation in September.
In Nigeria, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) shut its 200,000 barrel-a-day Bonga field this week after a tanker-loading accident caused less than 40,000 barrels of crude to leak.
Olympic Hosts
Brazilian officials are seeking 20 billion reais ($10.8 billion) in penalties from Chevron for the Nov. 7 leaks that the San Ramon, California-based company has estimated at 3,000 barrels.
The furor in a nation keen to protect beaches from floating globs of crude ahead of the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games may lead to new drilling rules so tough that oil exploration becomes unprofitable, said Adriano Pires, an economist and former adviser to Brazil's state oil ministry.
“What I fear is now we have a circus created around the Chevron problem, a real circus, and to show the people they are doing something they may create norms, legislation and proceedings that make it impracticable to get environmental licenses for offshore exploring,” Pires, head of the Brazilian Center for Infrastructure, a Rio-based energy-industry consultancy, said in a telephone interview.
Making Exploration Expensive
“Depending on the measures that the government may take, it would make oil exploration in Brazil much more expensive,” he said.
Brazil's federal police have said they intend to indict employees involved in the drilling that led to leaks from sea floor fissures near the $3.6 billion development, Kurt Glaubitz, a spokesman for Chevron, said in a Dec. 21 e-mail. In a separate statement, Transocean, owner of the drilling rig leased for the Frade field, said it will defend the company.
Chevron underestimated the amount of pressure at an oil deposit it was exploring, and crude leaked from the reservoir for about eight days, George Buck, president of Chevron's Brazilian subsidiary, said on Nov. 20. Buck was among 17 Chevron and Transocean employees targeted for indictments, the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper reported on Dec. 21. Glaubitz declined to identify the employees targeted for indictment.
Foreign Investment ‘Chill'
“I'm a little surprised by the stance that you're seeing in Brazil, largely because it's so excessive, potentially, that you could put a very big chill on foreign investment in the deep water,” Ted Harper, who helps manage about $6.8 billion in assets at Frost Investment Advisors in Houston, including about $50 million of Chevron shares, said in a phone interview.
The response so far in Brazil is an “overreaction,” he said.
Chevron has lagged its peers since the leaks were disclosed on Nov. 10. Chevron has gained 0.8 percent since then, compared with increases of 7.1 percent and 4.9 percent, respectively, for Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Shell, the biggest Western energy companies by market value.
ConocoPhillips, the third-largest U.S. oil company, said on Dec. 21 that it's taking responsibility for the Bohai Bay spill and is setting up compensation funds to support environmental research and affected communities.
Royal Dutch Shell, Europe's largest oil company, said yesterday as much as half of the crude that leaked from the Bonga installation has dissipated through natural dispersion and evaporation. Bonga, located 75 miles off Nigeria's coastline, pumps about 10 percent of the West African nation's oil.
Worst Since 1998
The leak may have been the country's worst since a January 1998 spill dumped an estimated 40,000 barrels into the sea from the Idoho platform on the southeastern coast, with slicks reported as far west as Lagos. Shell, the largest foreign oil producer in Nigeria, has been criticized by some local residents and foreign groups for onshore spills.
An “independent verification” of the Bonga platform incident is needed to ensure the spill wasn't more, Nnimmo Bassey, executive director of Environmental Rights Action, said in a phone interview from Lagos. “Shell has never been forthcoming about incidents of oil spills in the past.”
BP has booked more than $40 billion in losses related to last year's Gulf disaster that sank Transocean's Deepwater Horizon rig and spilled an estimated 4.9 million barrels of crude. The London-based oil producer also faces hundreds of lawsuits by fishermen, hoteliers and property owners in coastal areas where crude washed ashore.
More Awareness
Unlike the BP incident in the Gulf, this year's Brazilian and Chinese spills are within the normal range of oil industry accidents, Nansen Saleri, chief executive officer of Quantum Reservoir Impact LLC in Houston, said in a telephone interview.
“What's different right now, post-Macondo, is that there's far more awareness globally at all levels,” he said. In the long run, the industry will develop better and more stringent procedures to help prevent small incidents, he said, and oil and gas development will continue.
“Those countries who choose to go on a very punitive path at the end will suffer the negative consequences themselves,” said Saleri, who is a former reservoir-management chief at Saudi Arabia's state oil company.
A strong majority of registered voters say they don't believe Democrats have accepted that President Trump won the election fairly or that he is a legitimate president.
According to data from the latest Harvard-Harris poll provided exclusively to The Hill, 68 percent of voters said Democrats have not accepted that Trump won fairly and is a legitimate president.
That figure includes 69 percent of Republicans, 69 percent of independents and 65 percent of Democrats.
Only four months into Trump's presidency, Democrats have openly discussed impeachment and have accused the president of colluding with Russia to win the 2016 election, as well as trying to block investigations into the matter.

Trump's job approval has fallen to a new low in the poll, with 45 percent saying they approve of the job Trump is doing and 55 percent saying they disapprove. That is down from a 49 to 51 percent split in March.
Among Democrats, Trump's job approval is at just 16 percent, while 85 percent of Republicans support him, according to the poll. Among independents, 40 percent approve of the job Trump is doing, while 60 percent disapprove.
Still, Trump is more popular than either of the major political parties — the GOP's job approval rating is at 35 percent, while Democrats are slightly higher, at 37 percent.
The survey found the public is pessimistic about the trajectory of the country, with only 34 percent saying the nation is on the right track and 53 percent saying it's on the wrong track.
Sixty percent of Republicans say the country is on the right track, a view held by only 18 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of independents.
There is bullishness surrounding the economy, however, with 45 percent saying it's on the right track and 38 percent saying it's on the wrong track.
The top priority for voters by a long shot is a desire to stimulate American jobs. Behind that, voters would like to see lawmakers pass an infrastructure bill, destroy the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), repeal and replace ObamaCare and pass a comprehensive tax reform bill.
The Harvard-Harris online survey of 2,006 registered voters was conducted May 17-20. The partisan breakdown is 36 percent Democrat, 32 percent Republican, 29 percent independent and 3 percent other. The poll uses a methodology that doesn't produce a traditional margin of error.
The Harvard–Harris Poll is a collaboration of the Harvard Center for American Political Studies and The Harris Poll. The Hill will be working with Harvard-Harris throughout 2017. Full poll results will be posted online later this week.
There are two types of people, those who believe that kitchen with open shelves is handy for storing, plus beautiful and decorative; and those who think utensils, dishes and glasses should be kept behind closed doors. It's very, very, VERY hard not to fall in love with the open shelving trend. Unfortunately, they are not for everyone.
The advantages of open shelves are numerous: to begin with, shelves are much cheaper than the cabinets. They also happen to be very practical because they allow us to have items readily available. Kitchen with open shelves are easier on the eye, which helps create the feeling of spaciousness.
That being said, open shelving kitchen demands us to be more orderly and disciplined in our storage habits. If you are not the Martha Stewart type, and you have a tendency towards clutter, you might want to rethink cabinets before you commit. If you have the space to squeeze in a few decorative shelves that won't be part of the everyday kitchen hustle, go right ahead, they are beyond lovely. But open shelves require us to be neat in order to pull them off.
Let's explore the ways you can incorporate open shelving into your kitchen. The first way is to place only 2 or 3 shelves. It's the ideal solution to partly adopt this decorative style and not be haunted by order anxiety.

The second is to reserve the top half of the space for open shelves and keep your closed cabinets beneath. You will open up the space, because open kitchens feel airy and light.

The third way is to use only open shelves without any cupboards. As in love as you might be with this idea, you won't have room to hide clutter.
You will be showcasing everything. Your decorating abilities must be above average, so everything is visually harmonious, orderly and inviting. And practical. Because if everything looks beautiful, but doesn't adapt to your everyday needs, then you're bound to have a mess. If you're like me, and have fallen for the open shelves fever, here are a few tips that will help you nail your kitchen with open shelves.
1. Minimize
Be selective and practical. Choose what you really use, and place it near your working stations so clutter is avoided. Keep the mugs close at hand of the coffee maker, and so on. You don't have to display every mug of coffee you own, be selective about it. Stay with what you like and what you use the most.
2. Keep the order
Arrange objects in a way that makes sense to you, it can be according to the frequency of use or by type of objects. Arrange the dishes as you would if they were inside closed cabinets. A trick is to identify a connecting color palette that brings all your pieces together.
3. Fear of heights
A golden rule: place your most used items at the bottom, and keep the more decorative items on top, where you have less access to them. Pick wisely though, heavy items shouldn't be placed on top shelves regardless of the amount of use. They could fall and injure you.

4. Use containers
In the kitchen we have many tools that are necessary, but not necessarily beautiful; keep these hidden. Save the practical items, such as baking supplies or occasional utensils in containers or baskets. Store sugar, flour and other ingredients commonly used in transparent or colored containers maintaining the same model throughout. This gives continuity and visual order.
5. Dust alert
If you're worried about your less used dishes gathering dust, You might want to leave the shelves for decorative elements. For example, add a flower vase, plants, baskets, containers or ornaments, and also glass and metallic jars where you keep vegetables, pasta and flour. This way you can keep your dishes dust free.
6. Grease alert
Install the shelf away from the hob not to collect grease. Opt for closed cupboards if you need to put some extra storage near the cooker.
7. Showcase your china
Open shelves are perfect for showing off the dishes that you got as wedding gift and you never use. Do not be afraid to mix style and color, and include some unexpected vintage pieces.

Imagine designing one of our great cities from scratch. You would quickly discover that there is enough physical space for magnificent parks, playing fields, public swimming pools, urban nature reserves and allotments sufficient to meet the needs of everyone. Alternatively, you could designate the same space to a small proportion of its people – the richest citizens – who can afford large gardens, perhaps with their own swimming pools. The only way of securing space for both is to allow the suburbs to sprawl until the city becomes dysfunctional: impossible to supply with efficient services, lacking a sense of civic cohesion, and permanently snarled in traffic: Los Angeles for all.
Imagine designing a long-distance transport system for a nation that did not possess one. You'd find that there is plenty of room for everyone to travel swiftly and efficiently, in trains and luxury buses (an intercity bus can carry as many people as a mile of car traffic). But to supply the same mobility with private cars requires a prodigious use of land, concrete, metal and fuel. It can be done, but only at the cost of climate change, air pollution, the destruction of wonderful places and an assault on tranquillity, neighbourhood and community life.
This conflict is repeated in financial terms. In order that the very rich can pay less tax, public playgrounds are allowed to fall apart. The beneficiaries might use the extra money to build private play barns for their children. Public toilets are closed so that some people can install gold-plated taps in their bathrooms. Public swimming pools are put on restricted hours so that the very rich can turn up the thermostats in their private pools. Public galleries need to charge for entry so that billionaires can expand their own art collections. Wealth that could be shared and enjoyed by all is sequestered by a few.
Public luxury for all, or private luxury for some: this is the choice we face at all times – especially at this election
It is impossible to deliver a magnificent life for everyone by securing private space through private spending. Attempts to do so are highly inefficient, producing ridiculous levels of redundancy and replication. Look at roads, in which individual people, each encased in a tonne of metal, each taking up (at 70mph) 90 metres of lane, travel in parallel to the same destination. The expansion of public wealth creates more space for everyone; the expansion of private wealth reduces it, eventually damaging most people's quality of life.

This is a global issue, as well as a national one. According to the Global Footprint Network, every person in the UK uses the equivalent of 5 hectares of land and sea through the food we eat, the products we use and the carbon we release, which has to be absorbed somewhere if it is not to accelerate global warming. Yet the UK's “biocapacity” (our ability to absorb these impacts) is a little over 1 hectare per person. Our extravagance is a cost that others must bear.
Public luxury available to all, or private luxury available to some: this is the choice we face at all times, but especially at this election. It is the conflict between these two visions that defines – or should define – our political options. There is a significant difference between Labour and the Conservatives in this respect, but I wish it were stronger.
Labour, through its proposed cultural capital fund, will reinvest in public galleries and museums. It will defend and expand our libraries, youth centres, football grounds, railways and local bus services. Unlike the Conservative manifesto, which is almost silent on the issue, Labour's platform offers a reasonable list of protections to the living world.
But it also promises to “continue to upgrade our highways” (shortly after vowing to “encourage and enable people to get out of their cars”) and to provide new airport capacity. The conflicts are not acknowledged. Progress in the 21st century should be measured less by the new infrastructure you build than by the damaging infrastructure you retire.
Labour also misses a wonderful opportunity in its plans to expand affordable housing, to promote accommodation that both revives community and makes better use of space. In co-housing developments, people own or rent their own homes but share the rest of the land. Rather than chopping the available space into coffin-sized gardens in which a child cannot perform a cartwheel without hitting the fence, the children have room to run around together while the adults have space to garden and talk. Communal laundries release living space in people's homes. Carpools reduce the need for parking. Isolation gives way to conviviality.
More importantly, and less surprisingly, the Labour manifesto fails to acknowledge the left's great conundrum: the environmental damage caused by efforts to create jobs through economic growth. Like the Conservatives, like almost every party everywhere (the Greens are a notable exception), Labour's economic vision is based on the presumption that there are no limits. Both conservative and social democratic parties see the world as a magic pudding that can never be exhausted. They build their economic programmes on a fairytale.

And they have another unexamined premise in common: that money legitimately buys you the power to take what you want from the world. There is an almost universal assumption in politics that you have the right to help yourself to as much of the global commons (atmosphere, soil, water, fish) as you can afford, though this reduces what is left for other people to share. You have the right to occupy as much physical space as your money can buy, regardless of the restrictions this imposes on others.
Where does this licence arise? Even if private wealth were obtained through the exercise of virtue (an unlikely proposition at the best of times) or through enterprise and hard work (ever less probable, in this new age of inheritance and rent), it is hard to discern the just principle that translates this money into permission to acquire the space and resources on which other people depend for a decent quality of life. When and by whom was this permission granted? How does it correspond to our notion of equal rights, or our concept of democracy, which is based on an equal power to decide?
Whatever the result, this election has pushed the centre ground to the left | Steve Richards Read more
You will not find these questions asked in this election or in any other. They are fudged by recourse to the magical belief that there is enough space and resources for everyone to do as they wish, that infinite growth ensures that no one – when the parties' economic promises are fulfilled – will need to intrude on the interests of others. Yet, on this finite planet, they are the questions that will determine not only the quality of our lives but our security and, eventually, our survival. The primary task of all far-sighted politicians should be to decide first how much we can use, then how it can best be shared.
When the questions that count above all others are beyond the scope of politics, when almost everyone in public life is either too blinkered or too frightened to answer them, when – even in this great, defining election, which at last offers people meaningful political choice – neither large party can even name them, you begin to recognise how much trouble we are in.

RICHMOND — “I love you,” Shaka Smart was saying, as VCU's basketball reunion entered its sixth hour.
The object of his affection this time was Johnny Williams, VCU's senior point guard, whom Smart was hugging, because he was hugging everyone during a bipartisan postgame party that seemed like it might never end. Four hours earlier — just before his Texas team took the court against a Rams program he led to the Final Four — Smart had strolled to the middle of the Siegel Center court he once ruled. He was there to help present a signed basketball to Dianne Long, the program's senior secretary, who is now in her 34th season — under a ninth head coach.
“He told me that he loved me,” Long recalled, tears in her eyes. “He told me that when he left me, too. And it's sincere. It's sincere.”
It probably isn't enough to call the emotions mixed during Smart's first trip here with a visiting team, a blissfully raucous December affair that ended with a 71-67 Texas win. The emotions were swirled. They sloshed together. They piled on top of each other. Fans who cheered for Smart before the game also said they couldn't remember wanting to beat an opposing team this badly. Fans who cried when Smart left Richmond said they were seeking closure, calling this night the true end of the Shaka Smart era. The father of one former player wore a VCU jacket over his Texas polo — because that former player, Darius Theus, now works for Texas. The coaching staffs are so stocked with former co-workers and friends that it's a wonder the game ever started, what with all the necessary pregame handshakes and hugs.

Love mixed with pain mixed with a desire for revenge. And it was especially complicated because Smart wasn't just a successful basketball coach during the six seasons he spent building VCU into the biggest sports attraction in town. He was a civic fixture. He raised funds. He served on boards. He and his wife, Maya, became local institutions.
“They were like the king and queen of Richmond,” said Mat Shelton-Eide, the co-founder of VCURamNation.com.
“He was godlike,” said season ticket holder Mark Cross, one of the dozens of VCU boosters Smart hugged as he circled the court before the game.
“He was The Man in Richmond, basically,” said Charlotte Hornets guard Treveon Graham, one of a half-dozen ex-players still milling around the court long after the game ended.

Smart had stayed put at the school, even as his name was linked with cushier jobs at UCLA and Marquette and N.C. State, and fans wondered whether VCU's program had graduated from steppingstone to landing spot. Then Texas and its $21.7 million deal arrived in the spring of 2015. Smart left, and those fans who had lived through Jeff Capel's arrival and departure and Anthony Grant's arrival and departure had to do it again.
“There were some hearts broken,” said Chris Crowley, one of the best-known VCU supporters. “It's a pretty passionate fan base, but with that passion comes emotion sometimes, and it's not always happy emotion. There are some open and hurt feelings there.”
Tuesday offered a chance to let those feelings out. The school puts a clause in its head basketball coach's contract mandating a home-and-home series with his new employer if he leaves. When Capel decamped for Oklahoma, he brought his Sooners back to Richmond, and lost. When Grant headed to Alabama, he suffered the same fate. “Two of the best games we've ever had at the Siegel Center,” Crowley said.
So the VCU community had been looking forward to this game from the moment Smart left. Some said it was the most hyped regular season game they could remember. Standing-room tickets started at $75 on the secondary market, and students began lining up outside the arena at 10:30 in the morning.
“This is, I think, cathartic for everyone,” said Greg Burton, a local sports-radio host, moments before Smart appeared and grabbed him in a hug. “See, that's what I'm saying,” Burton said, as Smart hugged other well-wishers in the pregame crowd. “Everyone just wants to get a glimpse and say thanks, because every memory is so positive.”
Well, most of them, anyhow. The popular question this week was whether Smart might hear boos from those who felt betrayed, and as the coach walked out of the tunnel for the first time, there was at least one catcall. That came from Meade Fitzgerald, a 38-year-old VCU graduate who said his two favorite teams are now “VCU and whoever's playing Texas.”

“I just feel like he left the program at its peak, and he let a lot of people down,” Fitzgerald said. “It's like if your dad left your mom and then came back to your house with a new wife. Would you cheer that?”

But it seemed easier to find the other side, the people who wanted to thank Smart while beating him — showing that his ex-program was every bit the equal of a Big 12 school.
“We understand why he wanted to leave; you do it for your family, you do it for yourself,” Melanie Cross said. “We all have goals, and sometimes you can't stay in one place forever.”
Smart's successor, Will Wade, stayed just two years before leaving for LSU, a departure that made fans appreciate Smart's six seasons even more, and that likely took some of the edge off his return. So there were mostly cheers when he came out onto the court just before the game, raising his arm and waving to the crowd. He shared a long hug with VCU Coach Mike Rhoades, his former assistant — “I'm not here if it wasn't for Coach Smart,” Rhoades said after the game — and then he set about trying to earn Texas's first road win in two seasons.
Texas surged into an early lead, the deafening crowd settled down, and the Longhorns pushed their lead to 19 midway through the second half. Then VCU unleashed the sort of full-court blitz Smart had seen so many times from the other end of the gym, finally taking a one-point lead and setting off one of the loudest roars in the building's two decades.
The place was sold out for a 105th straight game — complete with a 24-year-old Smart impersonator who was invited to sit directly next to the Texas bench, and a group of adults dressed as a motorcycle gang and calling themselves the Rhoades Warriors. If you weren't convinced this night was complicated, you should have heard the howls when Smart complained about a call as fans pleaded for a technical.
And when you combined all those emotions with the rabid comeback, the noise became outrageous at the end. The din hovered in the air, crashing against your skull. Khris Lane, whose three-pointer gave VCU its only lead, tried saying something to himself during that mayhem, “But I couldn't even hear what I said to myself. It was that loud,” he said.
“That crowd was phenomenal,” Texas big man Dylan Osetkowski said.
“Pretty unbelievable,” said VCU's Justin Tillman, one of the last of Smart's guys.
“Like a playoff game,” Rhoades said. “You don't experience this in 95 percent, 98 percent of other basketball arenas.”
“We always used to talk about on the coaching staff here about how many wins a season this place is worth by itself,” Smart said of the 7,600-seat arena, which could have breathed life into a Farm Bill committee hearing. “Every once in a while you take a deep breath, and you say, ‘Man, this is a special place, and I was so unbelievably fortunate to be here for six years.' ”

Now he's coaching a Texas team boasting one of the country's highest-rated recruiting classes, with a future lottery pick in center Mohamed Bamba and enough talent to outlast his old program, even in that cauldron. So as the Longhorns made their free throws, that tiny bit of revenge VCU fans had imagined for two years flitted away.
Some still found what they were looking for. Like Jennifer Mullen, such a head-over-heels Shaka Smart fan that she displayed a photoshopped picture of herself with the coach inside her home on Valentine's Day. (“She has an unnatural love for the man,” joked her husband, Steve.) When Smart left, she cried. Before the game, she stood underneath the arena's Final Four display, talking about those tears, and how she needed a night like this.
“I really did get closure,” she said after the game. “This breakup will be easier.”

Neutral basketball fans, meanwhile, got the sort of game that should happen every December, if the big boys weren't so terrified. Smart tried to schedule games like this when he was at VCU, games that are so clearly good for the sport.
“But that's just not why people schedule,” he acknowledged. “They don't schedule what's better for the sport.”
As for the 40-year-old coach, he tried to downplay his return, to treat it like another game. Good luck with that, unless a normal game involves 100, 200, 500 hugs. Long after the game — when the arena would normally be empty and the visiting team rolling away in its bus — Smart was still grinning, still embracing friends, still asking people about his favorite cookies and telling people how much he loved them. There were security guards to hug, and parents of former players to hug, and parents of current players to hug, and enough photos to fill an album, and those seven or eight former players huddled in a corner of the arena.
“Some of those guys are my favorite guys I've ever coached, and I coached them here, so to come back here as a visiting coach is just a strange feeling,” he said, voice hoarse, as he made his way toward the exit. “It's strange. And in a good way. But that's what happens when you spend six years in a place.”
He chatted with a few more friends, handed out a few more hugs and posed for a few more photos. Then he finally left, wearing his Texas sweatsuit and gazing around his former home.
“This place,” he said to no one in particular, “is special.”

Ferozepur, August 30
The BJP, which has been hitherto confronting its coalition partner and long-term ally—the SAD — on terror links and drugs, seems to have been caught on the wrong foot with its several leaders getting booked in similar cases over the past sometime.
In the latest development, BJP (Rural) Minority Morcha district president Jarnail Singh (alias Judge Nimana) of Sodhinagar in Ferozepur was arrested by the Rajasthan Police for drug trafficking, along with his three accomplices.
Nimbahera Sadar police station SHO Ram Bilas said Jarnail Singh, Sukhwinder Singh, Sadhuram and Pargat, all residents of Ferozepur, had been arrested under Sections 15, 18, 61 and 85 of the NDPS Act. Around 190 kg poppy husk and 3 kg opium were seized from their possession, he said. The contrabands were reportedly brought from Madhya Pradesh.
Khamesara Superintendent of Police (Chittorgarh) Prasanna Kumar confirmed the arrests. The accused had been remanded in three-day police custody. “The SUV that they were travelling in had a fake registration number plate,” the SP said.
Earlier, Ferozepur BJP district president Jugraj Singh Katora, Ferozepur Yuva Morcha district president Jagpal Singh Sandhu (alias Jimmy), Mallanwala block president Gurcharan Singh and OSD to state BJP chief Kamal Sharma Amrinder Singh Chinna (alias Pothi) were booked on charges of accepting bribe to help persons accused in drugs and fake arms licences cases.
On June 29, the Rajasthan Police arrested two senior leaders of the SAD-BJP alliance with 7.5 kg poppy husk at Pallu sub-tehsil in Hanumangarh district. The erring leaders were identified as Asafwala (Fazilka) block samiti member Vijay Kumar Kamboj (alias Daddi) and SAD block president (rural) Mahal Singh Rana. Both of them were booked under the NDPS Act. Their supporters Lekhram, Balbir Singh and Ved Parkash, all from Fazlika—the constituency represented by State Health Minister Surjit Kumar Jayani—were also booked.

Officials even ordered his cat euthanized, and the man's family said the state still can't account for much of his personal property, reported the Bangor Daily News.
William Dean has Asperger's syndrome, which creates difficulty in his social interactions, and he also suffers from other mental health issues that resulted in a crisis that forced his admission to the state-run Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center in May 2012, after his mother's death.
The Maine Department of Health and Human Services filed a probate court motion in September 2012, seeking to be named his conservator and guardian, arguing that Dean was not capable of managing his finances and had misspent more than $200,000 from a family trust.
The state, which did not notify Dean's family members of the motion, also argued that there were tax liens on two properties Dean, now 70, had inherited after his mother died at 102 and his father died in 1990.
State officials sold the longtime Owls Head estate earlier this year for $205,000 — less than half its assessed value — to pay off back taxes despite efforts by relatives to keep the property in the family.
In fact, court records show the state moved up the sale date by one day after Dean's relatives learned about it and threatened to file a court injunction to block the sale, the newspaper reported.
“I think the state may have rushed,” said Tom Edwards, an Owls Head assessment agent.
The sale resulted in a capital gains tax of $31,000 levied against Dean because the residence was considered a second home for tax purposes.
The state tried to sell the family's home in Rockland, but a pipe broke during the winter because the home was not heated and caused major flooding, which then led to a mold outbreak that rendered the home uninhabitable.
Dean owed $5,192 in back taxes on the family's home in Owls Head and $2,329 owed to the home in Rockland, and state officials said the rest of Dean's assets would be preserved to pay for his care at a state-run psychiatric hospital.
He was discharged from the hospital in June 2013 and now lives in a one-room apartment in Rockland, and his family pays one neighbor to cook for Dean and another to clean up after him.
“My head has been in a whirlwind, it's hard to express,” Dean told the Daily News.
Dean is disqualified from state assistance, even though he's nearly broke, because he still owns the ruined Rockland home, which the state considers an asset worth $86,400 — even after the mold and flood damage.
His family's attorney filed court papers earlier this year that showed Dean had $654,000 worth of real estate that was free of mortgages when the state took control of his finances, but now he's down to about $20,000 in assets.
Dean, who is a musical savant, said he “was not very happy” about the below-market sale of his Owls Head home, a 2000 Cadillac Eldorado and three organs he enjoyed playing.
But Dean, who does not enjoy interacting with people, is most upset that state officials ordered the death of Caterpillar, his 10-year-old Himalayan cat companion.
“I get very emotional talking about it,” Dean said. “I got her from a shelter. She picked me out.”
State officials have defended their actions and claim immunity from liability while acting as conservator.
The lawsuits are seeking to overturn the sale of the Owls Head home to James Taylor, of Danvers, Massachusetts, and return it to Dean, along with monetary damages.
Dean said all he wants is “justice.”

Ontario Power Generation wants to construct an underground nuclear waste repository less than a mile from the shores of Lake Huron. (Photo: John Flesher / AP)
The United States and Canada have long shared an appreciation for the vital role the Great Lakes play in our economic and cultural lives and history — and a commitment to preserve and protect the Lakes for generations to come.
Today, that consensus is imperiled by a proposal from Ontario nuclear power generators, now pending in Ottawa, to sanction the construction of an underground nuclear waste repository in Kincardine, less than a mile from the shores of Lake Huron.
Ontario Power Generation, wholly owned by the Province of Ontario, is seeking to build a repository for 200,000 cubic meters of low- and medium-level radioactive waste in a limestone formation 2,200 feet below the surface. Its backers contend the waste can be more safely stored there than it is today, on-site at nuclear power generating stations.
In my view, that contention defies common sense. In a territory as vast and geologically diverse as Ontario, the notion that no viable alternative to Kincardine exists — one not in close proximity to the Lakes — is not credible.
That is why I have made repeated calls on our Department of State to pursue intervention by the U.S.-Canada International Joint Commission, a treaty organization that was formed to protect the Lakes more than a century ago, and work with the Canadian government to find such an alternative. It is also why I joined with a bipartisan majority of my colleagues in Congress to urge newly elected Canadian Premier Justin Trudeau, whose environment minister is scheduled to make a decision on the repository March 1, to do the same.
Our opposition to the Lake Huron nuclear waste facility reflects a broad consensus among the people who live in the Great Lakes watershed, and the 40 million citizens of both countries who rely on them for drinking water, that protecting the region's premiere natural resource is paramount. Reflecting that consensus, a citizens group opposed to the repository recently submitted more than 92,000 petition signatures to Premier Trudeau, asking him to reject the OPG proposal. Additionally, more than 180 local governments, representing about 22 million residents in both countries, have adopted resolutions in opposition to Kincardine.
While the case against the Canadian waste site is clear, those of us on this side of the border need to acknowledge we have failed to assume full responsibility for our own nuclear waste.
For more than a generation, it has been official U.S. policy to develop a long-term storage facility for high-level waste from power plants. And construction of such a facility was underway in Nevada when President Obama, at the urging of that state's lawmakers and environmental groups, abruptly shut down the project (a move that remains under legal challenge).
In the meantime, waste from American nuclear power plants is accumulating at temporary storage all over the country.
This situation is unsustainable.
We have an obligation to deal with waste generated by our nation's nuclear power plants, upon which we rely for a significant portion of our energy needs and which emit virtually no greenhouse gases.
But I firmly believe America can meet its obligation without threatening the Great Lakes with contamination.
So can Canada.
Millions of those who cherish the Lakes today, and the generations of Canadians and Americans who will do so in the future, deserve no less.

RideApart spies have captured the new 2014 Honda CTX1300 while undergoing its official promotional shoot. An all-new cruiser that combines the ST1300's V4 engine with the CTX700's accessibility, it looks as if Honda is pushing further into dragging the cruiser market kicking and screaming into the 21st century.
Photos: Chris Doane Automotive LLC
Immediately noticeable is the CTX1300's exposed, liquid-cooled V4 motor. Clearly the same that is used by the Honda ST1300, except here it takes advantage of the exposed cylinder heads and exhaust headers to achieve a strong, muscular appearance.
We believe the CTX1300's motor to be the same due to the appearance of those exhaust headers, cylinder heads and crank cases. The head bolts are in an identical position within the identical covers.
In the ST1300, that 1,260cc V4 produces 117 bhp at 8,000 rpm and 86 lb.-ft. of torque at 6,500 rpm. It powers the rear wheel through a shaft, as also clearly pictured in these images.
What we can't determine through these images is if the CTX1300 will be fitted with the CTX700's defining features — a Dual Clutch Transmission and Antilock Brakes. Forgive us a moment of speculation, but fitting those same features to the CTX1300 would be in line with Honda's recent product direction. Both features make the smaller CTX700 exceptionally new-rider friendly. The DCT removes the need for a clutch lever and can operate in either automatic or manual modes, while the ABS brakes prevent the brakes from locking either wheel, making the bike even easier to ride.
Honda is strongly targeting new riders with nearly all its latest product introductions. With the American motorcycle market shrinking, they need to create a new audience to sell products to in the future. The idea is that someone who starts on a Honda CBR300R may move up to a Honda CBR500R, then a Honda CBR600RR. This new CTX1300 provides the same level of progression to its cruiser range. You may start on a CTX700, buy a CTX1300 a few years later, then move up to a Honda Gold Wing F6B. A tiered product range makes it easy for riders to advance the size of their bike as their skill (and budget) increases.
This new CTX1300 follows many of the smaller, cheaper CTX700's design cues: half-fairing, hard panniers and a two-level seat. Upgrades on the larger bike appear to be LED running lights, integrated speakers (and presumably an affiliated infotainment system) in the cockpit, a chopped screen reminiscent of the F6B's and mirrors which incorporate LED turn signals. Like the ST1300, the CTX1300 has crash protectors mounted on the engine. A nice touch for a bike which should be equally at home commuting, touring or leisure riding.
Mid-mount footpegs and pulled-back bars give the CTX1300 a refreshingly practical, sit-up-and-beg riding position. That will facilitate both excellent control and comfort, elevating the bike over its less practical competitors.
Controversially, the CTX1300 is somewhat reminiscent of the ill-fated Honda DN-01. Perhaps the greatest challenge the CTX1300 faces is proving whether Honda's original concept of an accessible, practical, convenient cruiser holds commercial promise.
Local Washington state police have obtained a court warrant to search the Facebook page of a group dedicated to protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline.
The warrant from the Whatcom County Sheriff's Department seeks data surrounding the Bellingham #NoDAPL Coalition's Facebook page. The page, with more than 1,000 followers, provides information about pipeline environmental issues and is used to organize political protests and connect political activists.
In addition to demanding account information about those who have interacted with the group's page, the warrant seeks "messages, photos, videos, wall posts, and location information" dating from February 4 to February 15. The search time period surrounds a February 11 protest in downtown Bellingham against the Trump administration's decision to follow through with the pipeline. Protesters had blocked Interstate 5 for more than an hour, snarling traffic for miles.
Bellingham resident Neah Monteiro, the page's top admin, received an e-mail from Facebook after the protest. It said the social networking site had received a warrant for the data. The American Civil Liberties Union intervened and filed a motion (PDF) Thursday to quash the warrant. The ACLU said the data is constitutionally protected speech.
As the creator, and one of the 14 administrators, of the bellinghamnodapl Facebook group, Ms. Monteiro has constitutional rights that are plainly implicated by the execution of the County's warrant, which seeks her and her associates' private content including "messages, photos, videos, wall posts and location information." The warrant substantially burdens Ms. Monteiro's First Amendment right to free association, as well as that of the group's other members.
The ACLU said the Facebook page's contents, some but not all of which is publicly visible on the page, includes political views and opinions and images and videos of demonstrations. It also contains "potentially identifying information regarding members or associates of the Bellingham #NoDAPL Coalition. Disclosure of that information could reveal the names of individuals involved in planning or attending political protests, their images and political speech, the physical locations of the group's creator over a 12-day period, and more." The organization continued in its motion:
In fact, the County's warrant would reach the messages of even general members of the public who interacted with the group on the Facebook page by asking questions about the group's activities or engaging with the group in political debate. Hosting and participating in an online forum for political organizing, debate, and advocacy is activity that lies at the core of the First Amendment—and the Founders would have recognized it as such.
A hearing in Whatcom County Superior Court on the matter is set for next Tuesday.
Who are the worst dead conservative writers?
William Buckley would be my choice. (I have long used the term “Buckleyite” to describe the various phalanges of his far flung array of “conservative” groups. It's a term that has been in public usage since the 1960s.)
Robert Welch — not Ayn Rand — would be runner-up.
Together, Buckley and Welch pretty much closed the door on any adult discussion of really serious matters like race and Jewish issues.
Buckley — a CIA agent — cornered the market on the more inhibited self-identified as “high brow” element.
Welch — surrounded by Jews and financed by them — worked a different market: people who were more gutsy and less constrained by published opinion.
The idea that Buckley as an agent of the System's political police was going to “stop history in its tracks and tell it to turn around” (to use his self-description of National Review) is something only the hopelessly naive could entertain.
Re Mr. Welch, young people are probably too dismissive of the John Birch Society. JBS gobbled up and wasted probably well over 100 million dollars. In its heyday it was not what it later became — a collection of marginalized people of little influence.
Chief Justice Rehnquist was a John Birch Society member back in the early 60s. That this little factoid didn't become an issue in his confirmation hearings or in the media tells you that the System had a soft spot in its heart for him. And wisely so. In one of his opinions as an aside he went out of his way to say that he thought Beauharhais vs. Illinois was good law. This was a Supreme Court decision in 1952 that upheld a Canada-style law in Illinois making it a crime to say something that exposed an ethnic group or race up public contempt. Beauharnais (that may not be the exact name) was convicted and jailed for publishing statistics on the differential venereal disease rates between Whites and Blacks.
Several hundred thousand people were put through the Birch scam. They signed up. They were indoctrinated by the Society primarily to believe that race didn't matter, that nationality didn't matter (Welch used the term “Americanist” in lieu of “American” in his most repeated mantra that appeared on the covers or in the prefaces of the Society's books — “American” wasn't universalist enough for Welch), that anti-Semitism and “racism” were the hallmarks of Communist agents .
The Birch initiates were shorn of significant amounts of money. They were fed a world view in which all our problems emanated from a small group of consciously evil conspirators meeting in a basement in Ingolstadt or Frankfurt. All problems would have been nipped in the bud if someone had just called the police and raided Weisshaupt's cellar or the Frankfurt School. Completely bamboozled on race and Jews. Totally emasculated.
The standard fare of “exposing” the bad guys and their myriad successful evil doings eventually demoralized the Birch member. He became depressed. Gave up. Dropped out. But the innoculation against “racism” and “anti-semitism” took. No danger from such people. In fact, to the extent they remained politically active at all, they became active supporters of Israel and opponents of any effort to express White interests.
This was not accidental. A friend of mine who ran the American Opinion Bookstore in Atlanta secretly taped a planning meeting of JBS at which Nelson Sevier, the State Coordinator newly back from being trained in its headquarters in Belmont, Massachusetts, spoke. In it Sevier explained to the top 4 or 5 “Section Leaders” in Georgia that the primary purpose of Birch Society was to fight racism and anti-Semitism.
This was so because fighting racism and anti-Semitism was the most effective way to go after the Communist conspiracy, the primary purpose of which was to stir up White racism and anti-Semitism.
Sevier explained that Mr. Welch shrewdly put out just enough bait to lure White racists and anti-Semites out so that their influence could be negated once they exposed themselves.
The total impact of the Birch business is staggering when one thinks of how for decades people who were dissatisfied and suspicious were nipped in the bud, misled, and milked of money. A Hundred of thousands of people. More than 100 million dollars…and dollars that were the equivalent of several dollars today.
This also took place at a critical juncture, when the race mixing shoe was really pinching the foot.
Welch was a much odder figure than Buckley who I think was just the typical System self-promoter and social climber. (“Social climber” in a very odd sense. He sought acceptance and approval from people like Barbra Streisand, cafe society Jews. When Streisand invited Buckley and his wife to a cocktail party at her penthouse in Manhattan, the whole Buckleyite empire went into Second Coming hysteria. Their raison d'etre had been fulfilled. Bill and Pat had been invited by Barbra! It was perhaps bigger in their minds than the fall of the Berlin Wall to sincere anti-communists.
As for Buckley the and the Roman Catholics, here's a little vignette that puts this in an interesting light.
Joe Sobran wrote of the long process of his disillusionment with his idol Buckley. He said that the first time the iron hammer rang hollow on the metal god arose in the wake of a trip Sobran had made to give a speech in Chicago. After Sobran's speech an elderly couple approached him. They were Irish Roman Catholics. They said they were long friends of Buckley's parents who were in fact genuine high-society honorary WASPs which makes Buckley's “social climbing” for acceptance by cafe society Jews like Barbra Streisand all the odder.
They had known Bill when he was a child. They asked Sobran to mention them to Bill and to tell him that they said the Rosary once a week for him. The next work day after Sobran's return to New York, he and Buckley sat down for a post mortem on Sobran's speech to the conservative Catholic group in Chicago. Sobran began by mentioning the couple to Buckley and telling him about how these friends of his parents prayed the rosary for him once a week.
To Sobran's shock Buckley was irritated and contemptuous. “Those people are losers. They don't have any money. Why did you waste time with them?”
This remark is highly revealing.
Any normal psychology would react kindly and happily to hearing that two old people he had known as a child loved him and cared for him so much that they still engaged in a religious ritual for him on a weekly basis. (I have had Roman Catholics tell me that they pray for me and say rosaries for me. I've never reacted like Buckley; for all that I am not a Roman Catholic. I was touched by their concern and thanked them.)
For an ostentatious Roman Catholic like Buckley to react in this manner is truly shocking. Thoughtful people will immediately note something that is worthy of careful and thoughtful consideration … as Joe Sobran did.
I attended a big banquet in Atlanta JBS held in honor of Welch. (I was a guest. I never joined JBS.) A woman got up before Welch's speech who was an amateur singer. She asked everyone to stand for “Mr. Welch's favorite song.” (He insisted on being called “Mr. Welch” even by people who had known him for decades. Referring to him as “Mr. Welch” was a kind ritual among Birchers.)
I was curious to know what Mr. Welch's favorite song was. It was a stunner. She belted forth into “The Battle Hymn of the Republic!”
Welch grew up as a small town Southerner in North Carolina four generations ago when the smoke blackened ruins were everywhere. Southerners of his generation detested the song with its gloating references to trompling us out and reading us scripture out of the blazing barrels of guns.
That Welch as a small town Southerner would pick that “filthy abolitionist hymn” as my Father and Grandmother called it betokens a very strange psychology.
Honorable mention should also be made of Ralph Reed, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell.
The corralled the Evangelicals. Evangelicals as a group don't carry a lot of financial or political clout. But there are 10s of millions of them and Reed & Company very successfully channelized them and neutered them on things like immigration.
These characters (who, if they could be given a dose of sodium pentathol probably put the late Madelyn Murray O'Hare in the shade in the atheism department) have packed a big wollup.

Updated
10:07 a.m. MONDAY, NOV. 25: Meeting early this morning, the San Marcos City Council voted 4-0 to grant tax incentives that Michigan-based Corvac Composites LLC wanted to open a manufacturing plant on Clovis Barker Drive.
Mayor Daniel Guerrero and council members Wayne Becak, Shane Scott and Lisa Prewitt voted to approve an agreement that will forgive 80 percent of the company's city property taxes on “personal property” — primarily, equipment and inventory — for 10 years. The company will maintain a payroll of at least 30 full-time jobs with an average annual salary of $30,000.
Council members Jude Prather, John Thomaides and Ryan Thomason were not present for the vote.
Earlier
11:26 a.m. FRIDAY, NOV. 22: A Michigan-based auto parts maker appears to have settled on San Marcos as the location for a plant it intends to establish in Texas — if officials approve “inducements” the company wants from City Hall.
A major manufacturer of plastic vehicle components such as wheel well liners and underbody covers, Corvac Composites LLC is a supplier to Toyota, which operates an assembly plant in San Antonio for its Tundra and Tacoma pickup truck line. Corvac's other customers include Honda, Chrysler and Fiat, according to the company's website.
John Huber, the company's vice president for manufacturing, has already signed an agreement that commits Corvac to leasing a 100,000-square-foot facility at 2350 Clovis Barker Drive by Feb. 1 and beginning operations by June 1. Corvac will invest $3,650,000 in leasing the property and equipping it for manufacturing, according to the agreement.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS are urging the federal government to slap an emergency heritage listing on parts of the Cape York Peninsula amid an ''unprecedented'' number of applications to mine in the region.
The environmental group The Wilderness Society will today announce it has lodged an application for the Environment Minister, Tony Burke, to put an emergency protection in place to slow or stop the approval of new mines while permanent heritage listing is considered.

One of the group's northern Australia campaigners, Gavan McFadzean, said there were six mines proposed for the cape, each of which would need a new port and would together mean clearing 45,000 hectares of forest and native grassland.
''This is an unprecedented level of development on Cape York,'' he said. ''We're talking about some of the most intact marine and terrestrial wildernesses in the world.

The secret is out: supercar power is coming to the homegrown Commodore to create the fastest Holden of all time.
Talk about going out with a bang!
Holden will build a Commodore with more power than a Lamborghini as a high octane farewell present before the Adelaide production line falls silent next year.
The fastest and most powerful Commodore ever made will also be the most expensive, expected to cost in excess of $165,000 -- almost twice the price of the dearest model on sale today.
It will be the last V8 sedan made locally, and the most powerful vehicle produced in more than 100 years of Australian car manufacturing.
Holden declined to comment on "future model plans", however News Corp Australia can exclusively reveal General Motors in Detroit has finally given the green light to build a Commodore powered by the supercharged "LS9" V8 from the Corvette ZR1.
The swansong supercar will eclipse the power of the current Commodore flagship -- the Holden Special Vehicles GTS -- with performance that will outpace the latest Porsches and Ferraris.
It will only be available with a manual gearbox because the engine has too much power for an automatic.
With in excess of 600 horsepower (or 475kW in modern terms) the limited edition will have more grunt than a V8 Supercar racing machine.
Fewer than 250 are expected to be built, as there are only a limited number of these particular supercharged V8 engines available out of the US.
Holden dealers have been inundated with enquiries following speculation on internet forums -- but the project is so secret they too are in the dark.
Fan gossip says the car will be called "GTS-R", a reference to a limited edition from 1996. But News Corp Australia understands the new super sedan will have a unique name to reflect its exclusivity.
The supercar will be made by Holden Special Vehicles, a separate Melbourne-based firm that has been building Holden's performance models for 29 years after the break-up with racing legend Peter Brock.
Part of the reason the Holden supercar is so expensive is because it will be built in a partially complete form on the Adelaide production line with the supercharged engine and gearbox from the HSV GTS -- which will then be replaced by the "LS9" V8 at HSV in Melbourne.
It is not the first time HSV has performed a heart transplant.
In 2008 the company replaced the "donor" Holden engine with a massive 7.0-litre V8 from a racing version of the Corvette; in the end 137 HSV W427 cars were built at a cost of $155,500 each. Production ended prematurely in 2009 as the Global Financial Crisis took hold.
With buyers holding out for the last locally made Commodores, Holden is confident the supercar will be an instant sellout -- especially as the imported Commodore due in 2018 will only have four-cylinder and V6 power.
Holden's hot rods
2008: HSV W427
Engine: 7.0-litre V8
Power: 375kW/640Nm
Price: $155,500
Why it is special: It is the biggest engine (in capacity) ever fitted to an Australian made car.
2013: HSV GTS
Engine: Supercharged "LSA" 6.2-litre V8
Power: 430kW/740Nm
Price: $96,990
Why it is special: It is the most powerful car ever made in Australia (to date), eclipsing the W427.
2017: HSV Final Edition
Engine: Supercharged "LS9" 6.2-litre V8
Power: 475kW/820Nm
Price: $165,000 (estimated)
Why it is special: It will go down in history as the most powerful Australian made car of all time.
How it will get built
Holden will build the new supercar in partially complete form as a HSV GTS on the production line in Elizabeth, near Adelaide.
The cars will then be transported to HSV at Clayton, near Melbourne, where the GTS supercharged V8 and transmission will be removed and the new "LS9" supercharged V8 and heavy-duty transmission will be installed.
Other performance parts, such as bigger brakes, wheels, bodykit and exhaust will also be fitted at HSV in Clayton.
The as yet un-named supercar will then get transported to selected Holden dealers (65 of 220 across the network).
What will it be called?
Web forums speculate it will be called GTS-R, a reference to the special edition made in 1996 (of which just 85 were built). But News Corp understands HSV is planning on a unique name for its final homegrown hero car.
Why has it been so secret?
HSV had to meet strict global reliability standards set by General Motors in Detroit and it has taken until now to validate the engine transplant process and other engineering changes, including bringing the engine up to Euro V.

Urban farms are sprouting from the rooftops of Hong Kong's high-rises in an attempt to bridge the gap between city and nature. Courtesy of Christopher DeWolf

HONG KONG—It's not easy to find the Mango King. “Do you want to go the safe way? Or the quick way?” asks Michael Leung, a designer and urban farming advocate, as we walk past the wholesale fruit market in Hong Kong's Yau Ma Tei district, halfway up the Kowloon Peninsula. We opt for the quick way, which takes us through a tangled web of highway off-ramps and access roads. Two decades ago, this area was open water, but land reclamation and infrastructure works have turned it into an uninviting no man's land next to one of Hong Kong's most crowded neighborhoods.
Somewhere in this mess of traffic is a leftover patch of land that has been turned into an illegal farm.
“We call him the Mango King because he loves mangoes so much,” Leung says after we dodge an oncoming taxi. The Mango King is one of a growing number of urban farmers in Hong Kong, maximizing the city's tight spaces to produce his own food. He currently grows sweet potatoes, 45 papaya trees, five mango trees, three banana trees, and two lychee trees on 700 square feet of land.
Hong Kong is one of the world's most densely populated cities, famous for its skyscraper canyons and gritty, neon-lit streets. But most of its 1,100-square-kilometer territory is actually undeveloped—country parks alone account for more than half of the city's land area. Instead of fostering a close connection between city-dwellers and nature, though, the opposite has happened: Hong Kong today is a city largely devoid of greenery, despite being surrounded by a spectacular procession of green mountains and craggy shorelines.
The city's disconnect with nature has broad implications. In the early 1990s, a full third of Hong Kong's fruits and vegetables were produced locally in the New Territories, the hinterland that stretches from urban Kowloon to the border with mainland China. Today, that number has plummeted to 2.3 percent, with nearly everything imported from the mainland and beyond: apples from the United States, kiwis from Italy, oranges from South Africa. Recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in local organic agriculture among young people born in the 1980s and '90s, but with a steady supply of cheap, imported produce arriving daily in Hong Kong's port, changing the attitudes of the broader populace isn't easy.
That's where Leung comes in. Born in London to Hong Konger parents, he moved to the city in 2009, when he was 26 years old, and has since embarked on a series of projects that combine art, design, community work, and urban agriculture. One of his most popular initiatives, HK Honey, connects local beekeepers with apartment dwellers who are eager to install beehives on their rooftops and balconies as an eco-friendly gesture (and to reap the benefits of delicious honey, no doubt). He's currently focused on HK Farm, a network of rooftop gardens around Yau Ma Tei, one of Hong Kong's oldest neighborhoods and one that hasn't seen much agricultural activity for the better part of a century.

“Growing food shouldn't be exclusive to the New Territories—it should happen in the urban area as well,” Leung says. “It encourages people to think about food origin, the use of public space, their neighborhood—there are many areas in Hong Kong that have no neighborhood spirit.”
In Yau Ma Tei, Leung has tapped into a small but passionate community of artists, activists, and longtime residents who are nurturing life from between the cracks of the concrete jungle.
The Mango King is a compact, middle-age man with graying hair, a weathered face, and well-worn jeans smeared with dirt. He lives in a lean-to under the shade of wispy horsetail trees, surrounded on all sides by speeding traffic. After ducking through a hole in a chain-link fence, we present him with a bag of ripe mangoes and he enthusiastically shows us around his farm.
“Ten years—that's the fastest a mango tree will grow from seed, if you want mangoes,” he says, showing us some tiny seedlings. “But if you use cuttings, it's two years.” (Cuttings are cut portions of a plant that can be transplanted into soil.) Nearby, a few pineapple heads stick out of the ground, next to a large spread of sweet potato plants. “I've only been doing this for a year here, but there's construction nearby and some surveyors told me they might kick me off this land,” he says. “But that wouldn't be for at least half a year, and by then I'll be harvesting.”
Cultivating food in the middle of a spaghetti junction is not an easy endeavor. There's no running water, so the Mango King walks to a nearby shopping mall to fill up plastic jugs. And when he cooks, passing drivers are often alarmed by the smoke and call the fire department. For the most part, though, the authorities leave him alone.
I ask the Mango King why he started growing food—and why here of all places. He evades the question and instead talks about a memory from his youth. “Back in my village in China, I dabbled in farming with my friends—actually, it was more like I watched them grow things,” he says. “Growing things, it's all about experience and how passionate you are. If you're not into it, nothing will grow.” (Later, Leung tells me that the Mango King doesn't like talking about his past or how he ended up on the street. “I think he's had a rough life,” he says.)

Twenty minutes later, we arrive at So Boring, an informal pay-what-you-can coffee shop with folding tables set up on the sidewalk of Ferry Street. All the food here is locally grown and organic, and the café donates some of its waste—like pineapple heads—to the Mango King. We join a half-dozen staff and regulars sitting outside. Leung introduces me to Fredma, a 72-year-old woman with a commanding in presence. After I decline a dish of locally grown pumpkin curry—I've already eaten, I tell her—she insists. “Ho mei,” she says. “It's delicious.” I relent, and she is right—sweet, earthy, and a bit spicy.
Leung and Fredma met through Wooferten, a group of artist-activists that run a community art space nearby. Fredma (so nicknamed because she has a son named Fred) shows up nearly every day and considers herself an urban agriculture enthusiast. Last year, Modern Farmer magazine featured her Typhoon Tea, which she created on a stormy day with peppermint, honey, and lime harvested from Leung's roof.

In many ways, Fredma embodies what's best about Hong Kong: a make-do attitude that can lead to brilliant, improvised responses to tough urban conditions. The same kind of ingenuity can be seen on Canton Road, where the owner of a Chinese medicine shop, Mr. Pang, has turned the street signpost outside his business into an ad hoc planter that now overflows with basil and other herbs.
“I used to keep some plants on the pavement outside, but there wasn't enough light, so they didn't grow very well,” Pang says when I visit him one weekend afternoon. A middle-age man with taut, tanned skin, he sits behind a counter, jars of various herbs stacked on the wall behind him. “I noticed the sign and thought, ‘Why not hoist them up?' It's like having a sky garden.”
Inspired by Pang, Michael Leung and Wooferten have been making planters for street signs around the neighborhood, working with shops to decide what to grow and teaching them how to water the plants. Pang uses a makeshift device that consists of a plastic container attached to a long rod and a string that releases water when pulled. “They think they're just growing stuff, but we see it as guerilla gardening in that they're making use of vacant public space,” Leung says.
Neighbors seem fond of the idea. As I speak with Pang, a friend of his who's been hanging around the shop chimes in. “He's very creative!” the friend says, laughing. “They should give him a patent.” He turns to Pang. “Just watch out—the government will come catch you if the plants fall on somebody's head.”
He's only half joking. Hong Kong's government is no friend of guerilla gardening, running television ads against illegal planting and tearing up informal vegetable and herb patches that elderly people grow on vacant pieces of land, with the pretext that illegal gardening could attract mosquitoes and cause landslides in hilly areas. There aren't many alternatives, either—there are just 22 government-run community gardens in Hong Kong's public parks, and demand is so high that plots are rented out for only four months at a time. And though the government's Greening Master Plan has made big strides to introduce more greenery to public spaces by planting shrubs, trees, and flowers along roadsides and in other concrete-heavy areas, it makes no allowance for productive gardens. “Basically, we adopt the ‘right species at the right place' principle in selecting plant species,” a spokeswoman for the Civil Engineering and Development Department tells me when I ask why all this new greenery doesn't include edible plants that people could harvest.
Meanwhile, the government has been actively thinning the number of fruit-bearing trees in parks and along streets, replacing them with lower-maintenance species, such as palms. “There used to be a papaya tree around the corner from here, but neighbors say it was cleared off,” says Sum Wing Man, a 28-year-old artist, when I meet her on the rooftop garden she helps maintain, a seventh-floor oasis surrounded by concrete apartment towers on all sides. “But even if there was fruit, you cannot eat it, because they spray everything with chemicals.”

Sum developed her green thumb after moving to a studio in the countryside. “I was not making any art—I just had a good life, cooking every meal, planting my own food,” she says. That led her to Mapopo Farm, an organic agricultural settlement active in Hong Kong's local food movement, and from there she ended up working with Yau Ma Tei Gardener, a group that runs this rooftop farm.
Sum explains that the group began after its founder, artist Vangi Fong, rented a studio in a walkup apartment building on Shanghai Street and began growing vegetables on the roof. One day, Fong found a letter tucked into one of her plants. “It said, ‘We both like planting. Maybe we can be friends,'” says Sum. “It was signed, ‘Uncle Mui.'” Mui has lived downstairs for more than 40 years, but he never had an opportunity to put his green thumb to use, beyond maintaining a few potted plants. One thing led to another and soon about a dozen people were involved in running the garden and hosting workshops. “We made seed bombs”—a compressed bundle of soil containing seeds—“and threw them on buildings, in parks, on abandoned land,” Sum says. “We didn't have much success. A lot of them were taken away by park cleaners.”
As we sit on the roof, another Yau Ma Tei gardener named Step Au joins us. She and Sum take me on a tour of the rooftop, where ginger, lemongrass, pineapples, and potatoes are growing in a variety of recycled plastic buckets, old wooden drawers, and small containers donated by a Chinese medicine shop.
I ask the pair why they dedicate their time to rooftop vegetable gardening and illicit seed bombing. “It's about the right to public space,” Au says. “And I like that we're not just planting for viewing—we're planting to change what we eat. It's a little contribution every day.”
As I leave the rooftop, I descend the narrow stairwell and hear violin notes coming from an elderly musicians' association on the second floor. I turn right as I leave the building, and as I dodge pedestrians on Shanghai Street, I notice something growing inside one of the street signposts.
I walk closer and look up: chili peppers.
You could call it something like Cohen's Law – named, of course, for Nick Cohen, the seething thing in the middle pages of the Observer – or the Iron Law of Online Abuse. It goes something like this: every single pundit or journalist who goes on a moral crusade against left-wing social-media crudery will have, very recently, done the exact same things they're complaining against. They will have used insults, personal attacks, expletives, epithets, or unpleasant sexual suggestions; they will have engaged in bullying or spiteful little squabbles; they will have indulged in some form of racism, sexism, homophobia, or transphobia; they will have encouraged political repression, violence, or censorship; they will have threatened to contact someone's editor or boss or the police or otherwise have conspired to ruin their life. Chances are that they won't have been very good at it, but they will have been mean; they will have used invective. This is always – always – true.
Nick Cohen gets the honours, firstly because he's just awful, and secondly because he's such a luminously dumb exemplar of this tendency: in column after column he condemns the vicious epithets suffered by MPs and public figures, grouching for civility and good, clean, open debate – but, when he's not play-acting at high-mindedness, he compares socialists in solidarity with the Bolivarian revolution to sex tourists, flings antisemitic stereotypes at anti-Zionist Jews, and apostrophises Corbyn's supporters as ‘fucking fools.' This week, three young men with a podcast were monstered by the right-wing press, their names and faces revealed to an audience of frothing reactionaries, for posting a photo of Yvette Cooper MP in a first-class train carriage without her consent, and calling her a ‘bellend.' (Cohen's Law: the same publication, so primly outraged by the epithet that it had to render it as ‘bell**d,' itself puts out material in which migrants are compared to rats) The publication of the photo had already been subjected to a comradely critique from within the left for its misogynistic overtones; the podcast account had apologised and taken it down. It was only afterwards that the reactionary press seized on the incident as part of its war of extermination against all left-wing thought, and moderate liberals happily joined in. If you don't uncritically support a Daily Mail smear campaign, they said, you're an abuser. How did Cohen respond to all this? With a personal insult about the appearances of the three men, of course. The Law is never wrong.
My point here isn't to simply condemn the hypocrisy of Cohen and his ilk, although their hypocrisy is stunning. I'm certainly not trying to uphold the principle that they themselves fail to meet – don't be rude, don't be nasty, demolish ideas and not people, never find inventive ways to mock your enemies. As I've said before, there's a great virtue in well-crafted nastiness, and there are few better measures of a good writer than how well they rise to the challenge of magnificently crushing somebody else. But when it comes to the question of online abuse, the left is forced to fight on strangely uneven territory. No wonder, then, that it's the favoured terrain for anti-socialists. In Britain and in America, whenever a positive, hopeful, emancipatory left-wing movement makes electoral successes, it's immediately dogged by claims that its supporters are behaving intemperately online. And it's usually true. You will find supporters of any movement saying deeply unpleasant things on the internet. (All this stuff is, for some reason, usually treated as the voice of a rampaging, uncensored id, humanity's oldest and worst instincts from the vicious dawn of the species suddenly re-amplified by technology; what it actually is, of course, is the voice of a rampaging, censorious superego.) But the goal of the accusation is always to present online abuse as a peculiarly left-wing phenomenon, or to make innuendoes towards some kind of complicity between the socialist left and the Nazi alt-right in their shared fondness for being mean online. This red-baiting tactic should be recognised for what it is: one of desperation. Most voters have better sense than to care too much about what's happening on Twitter; it's instructive that the latest round of deeply stupid recriminations in the UK only emerged after the June election made it impossible to continue arguing that Corbynism is inherently unelectable. The point isn't to actually win on these grounds: it's a delaying tactic, an attempt to set leftists against each other, to draw us onto unforgiving terrain, to have us all talking, interminably, about online abuse
So let's talk about online abuse. What actually is it? A man who called a Tory MP a ‘backstabber' and said that ‘austerity has murdered tens of thousands of disabled people' was accused, by that MP, of abuse. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, who quoted Engels in referring to the Grenfell Tower massacre as ‘social murder,' was implicitly accused of inciting abuse. Someone who accused a Labour MP of ‘xenophobia' for pandering to anti-migration sentiments during the EU referendum debate was told in turn that what they were doing was abuse. There's a rhetorical legerdemain here. Legal definitions exist for domestic abuse and workplace abuse; these things have workable meanings. Online abuse has none. The term ‘abuse' is amorphous and pullulating: it means death or rape threats, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, obsessive stalking, menacing messages and intimidation – but it also bundles up all those evils with critique, invective, any form of political anger, any form of negativity. These things are all forms of hate, and it's forbidden to hate, even to hate what is evil. If someone tells a member of a government that routinely destroys lives that they are, in fact, destroying lives, this is abuse: it's basically the same as making a violent death threat. If you call someone a ‘warmonger' just because they want to start a war, this is abuse, and for that reason alone, the war must go ahead.
Socialists are continually called upon to condemn all abuse. We should be careful about doing this; the term is fundamentally deeply dishonest. It has a way of inverting actual power relations: the powerful, the corrupt and chrematistic and condescending, become the victims of a population half-starved and lied to. You can forget, almost, that the people being abused might also be killers. Movements to end mass social slaughter and build socialism in its place are delegitimised by political anger of any kind, but the engines of the vast structure of repression always remain respectable in their monstrosity. If there is racism, or sexism, or homophobia, or transphobia, then that is what it should be called, and that is what should be condemned: we should oppose it wherever it appears, and especially within our own movement. But nobody should ever feel obliged to condemn the act of not respecting your betters.
Hierarchy, in the end, is what it all boils down to. Once, writers were more up-front about this kind of thing. The great English reactionary Edmund Burke, writing against the horrors of the French Revolution, lingers over the violation of Marie Antoinette's bedchamber, in dark and gushing prose. ‘A band of cruel ruffians and assassins rushed into the chamber of the queen and pierced with a hundred strokes of bayonets and poniards the bed, from whence this persecuted woman had but just time to fly.' This is the essence of the confounding of ‘all orders, ranks, and distinctions': in normal times, pointed weapons should be used to dispatch the people who didn't even have a bed; for these sans-brolottes to attack a queen's mattress is an inversion of the natural order worse than massacre of peasants by violence or poverty in history.
Today, there are no armed assaults on the Queen to condemn. Instead, there is a sociology of the term ‘abuse,' a subject-capable-of-being-abused, a subject-capable-of-abusing. The primary determining factor is, of course, class, in all its articulations. This is where Cohen's Law is important. After all, the only people more profoundly unpleasant on Twitter than right-wing Labour MPs, who take a perverse delight in mocking and blocking their own constituents, are some of my colleagues in the media. Often, the same people who are obsessively demanding that leftie snowflakes put aside their trigger warnings and toughen up will turn into a fainting nineteenth-century prude the moment an unkind word is sent in their direction. An unknown and unimportant person who calls a journalist or a politician a prick online is engaging in abuse; she is part of the bloodthirsty mob; her actions are immediately concatenated with every evil and prejudice imaginable. If the journalist or politician calls her a prick back, this is a delightful little piece of vulgarity, a witty rejoinder, a cutting put-down, an artist enjoying the varied fruits of their craft. They can write articles demonising some of the most vulnerable elements of society, and this is just a reasoned opinion; they can create policies that materially harm thousands of people and cement the power of the ruling class, and this is just a necessity of government. If an ordinary and powerless member of the public sends an email full of racial invective, it's (quite rightfully) condemned – vile, hateful, sickening abuse, utterly unacceptable, drivel from the lowest dregs of humanity – but if professional writers build up a vast archive of work that delegitimises (to take a purely random example) the rights and identities of trans people, it's part of a debate. Confront the magazine writer with the terms used to describe the anonymous emailer, and you too will be engaging in abuse. The prejudice is very rarely the real source of the objection. It's the rudeness, the social impropriety, the talking back to your betters.
Nobody should be surprised that the great and the good also behave badly online. The internet is a close, dark, humid void that sits in the palm of your hand, and it's full of everyone you could ever have a reason to hate. It's an open-plan bestiary, where the monsters of ideology shudder and crawl and tear into each other with strange serrated claws, scattering viscera in every black and boundless direction, but unable to ever kill or to ever die. The only way to live there is to grow grim keratins yourself. I don't begrudge Nick Cohen his personal attacks; if they were actually any good, and if they didn't stray into dishonesty and antisemitism, I might admire him for them. Invective can be vital and creative and fun. But for so many people they're accompanied by an unbearable sanctimony. It's sometimes claimed that the left has decided that our ‘moral purity' gives us the right to attack anyone we like. It might be true. But these centrists, who have twisted their lack of principle into an obscure virtue, claim for themselves a much more destructive right: primly appalled, they can do whatever they like to destroy another person, because they were rude first. The language of respected opinion leaders collapses into infantile babble: a leering spectacle, children's heads stitched to hulking adult bodies. He started it. I'm telling on you. A game of osctracisms and recriminations, all of it far more vicious and unpleasant than a good sharp ‘cunt.'
Buried in all of this is the expectation that those who occasionally inform the people who do wrong that they are doing wrong will stop, if they're just hectored enough. This will not happen. One way to fix the ‘abuse' problem is methodological and technological; this is the one that's already being put into place. I have a blue tick on Twitter; I can swear at Nick Cohen all I like, and sometimes do. Most users, however, will be subjected to automated moderation if they say anything to him that the algorithm decides he might not like. The effect is to entrench the existing class system, to tear out the throats of the voiceless, and create a world safer for idiot men and their gusts of opinion; there's less unpleasantness on Twitter, but only for the people who keep writing columns about how unfairly they're treated on Twitter. The other way to fix the problem is harder, but it might actually work: to start building a world that is not sustained through perpetual cycles of immiseration and malice, in which the mutual recognition of all human subjects replaces the scraping respect for authority, and in which we could decide to enjoy being extravagantly mean to each other if we liked, without any harm ever being done.

Nineteen Letters Long is a webcomic that launched in June of 2013, adding some brilliantly hilarious comics to the world in a graphically-pleasing way. Often arranged in a multi-panel format, creator Brian Buie uses his comic as a venue to highlight some of the oddities that we all face in life. Sometimes he delves into the human mind, exposing somewhat embarrassing thoughts. Other times, he personifies inanimate objects, providing funny insights into unexplored possibilities of what those things could be thinking if they had a conscious mind.
The true beauty of Nineteen Letters Long is how Brian continues to shed light on the things that people often take so serious. I, for one, have been a repeat offender on that front, which is why I started creating comics in the first place. I think that is why I personally love Nineteen Letters Long and the way Brian regularly reminds viewers that if we take a step back and really look at it, life's just so silly. Read more about this incredible designer in my interview with him below:
Interview with Brian Buie, Creator of Nineteen Letters Long:
Q. Have you always been an artist and/or what got you into drawing comics?
A. I've always been into art. I went to art school at the Kansas City Art Institute right after high school. I've been all around the board. I did painting, drawing, Illustration, web design (flash websites eeeeek), and both 2-D and 3-D animation in highschool. I thought I would continue doing animation in college, but ended up moving to sculpture. I left the Art Institute to maybe take up Architecture, but ended up sticking with Graphic Design. And now that I've got my degree in Graphic Design, I'm illustrating comics.
Q. What inspired you to begin Nineteen Letters Long?
A. During my final semester in Design (last spring), I took up the Illustrator position at the school's newspaper on a whim, and made 2 comics that were featured on the back page of the paper. Seeing the positive response from that (and getting to the front page of reddit for the first time) is what caused me to start Nineteen Letters Long.
Q. I started following your comics immediately after your launch on Facebook, loving the first one I saw, which was “How to tell a joke.” What have been some of your more well-received comics?
A. Let's see, here are some of the more popular ones:
Q. For all comic artists, some comics get a better reception than others. Does the reception of a comic affect how you proceed with the content for your upcoming comics?
A. Seeing a hugely positive response to some comics and not others certainly affected me a lot at first. It was always a huge bummer when I would make a comic that I thought would do really well, and then it kind of flopped. I also started noticing that I didn't enjoy the actual comic making process as much when I was doing it to please the internet. I've gotten a lot better about doing them for myself and for the sake of illustrating. It's a lot more fun when I post the comic and I know that I enjoyed putting as much effort in to it as I could, and the response from others doesn't change that.
Q. Your font choices and artistic elements in your comics have changed since your launch in June 2013. How has your process changed and why?
A. I think part of it has to do with getting more familiar with the programs and processes. It's kind of funny thinking back on some of the first comics I made and how I had no idea what I was doing. I'm sure I'll eventually look back on right now and think the same thing, but that means I'm learning! I also used to be really concerned with finding a style and sticking with it, so all of the comics would be cohesive and recognizable as mine. I took a step back after getting through my first 50 comics, and realized I wasn't where I wanted to be, and it was because I was trying to stick to a poorly developed style. I decided that I wasn't going to bother myself with that anymore, and just experiment as much as possible. Over time, certain things will start to stick, and I'll eventually have some sort of style.
Q. I know the people who process my UPS orders must wonder what type of weird person I am. Does your day job at UPS help inspire some of your comics?
A. Yeah, it can sometimes. The characters that work there have definitely inspired some characters in my comics. At the very least, the mindlessness of the job has given me plenty of time to think of comic ideas. I get funny looks sometimes when I burst out laughing for no particular reason.
Q. I loved seeing the time-lapse video of the fan art you made for me. How long does your actual process average in real-time?
A. It definitely differs from one comic to the next. I'd say on average, a comic will take me 3-4 hours. Oddly enough, when I'm recording my process, it only takes me around 2 hours. I'm guessing it's because I can't wander over to Craigslist to look for used furniture while it's recording.
Q. What are some comics that best sum up what Nineteen Letters Long is about:
Q. If you could create Nineteen Letters Long animated short, what would be the one message/lesson you would want viewers to walk away with?
A. Life is funny. Everything is funny, and there's absolutely no denying it. You're horribly depressed? That's hilarious! I mean really, it is. Your brain is producing chemicals that cause you to think that the world is terrible. You wanna know the best part? It makes you think that you're depressed BECAUSE the world is terrible, WHEN IT'S REALLY THE OTHER WAY AROUND! HAHA! You just got pranked by your own brain!
Q. Who have been your biggest comic influences and why?
A. I like a lot of different comics for different reasons. I think the biggest thing that jumps out at me is the writing. It definitely makes or breaks a comic, and is something that I try and focus on the most with my own comic. Some of my favorites are:
Q. What has been the best piece of design or artistic advice that you have received? What one piece of advice would you give aspiring comic artists who are new to the world of webcomics?
A. I gotta go with the Ira Glass quote about the gap between your ability and taste:
“All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it's just not that good. It's trying to be good, it has potential, but it's not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn't have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions.” ~ Ira Glass
This advice has really resonated with me. I think I'm getting better, but I'm still far from where I want to be, and that's okay.
As for new comic artists, have fun with it. If you're doing it for any other reason, it's going to turn into a chore. If you're getting bored, do something new, and get weird with it. Making it fun is the most important part, because you sure as hell aren't going to make any money off of it and nobody is going to look at it anytime soon. Make yourself laugh and who knows, maybe some other people will laugh too.
Q. What are your future goals and/or up-and-coming projects?
A. I definitely want to print some small ‘zines soon. I'd like to try some short stories and eventually work up to a big book. I'd also like to do some animation soon.
Q. Anything else you want to add?
A. If you take a can of tuna and mix it with bar-b-que sauce and put it on a sandwich, it's just as good as fancy meat. The big BBQ corporations don't want you to know that though.

Ask many Americans where Slovenia is located and you're likely to get almost as many answers. The Eagles Troll knows better, though. With Eagles Fan Rok hosting, he fit in perfectly in this gorgeous country which boasts 2% of all terrestrial creatures. I bet you also didn't know it's the third-most forested country in the world, with some of the most gorgeous coastline. To top it off, Slovenia is one of the countries with the largest number of religious buildings per capita in Europe There are almost 3,000 churches, chapels and religious monuments around Slovenia. Sounds ripe for establishing a Church of Our Soaring Eagles.
“After quite some time the Eagles Troll finally made it's way to Slovenia. Due to bad weather I only made a couple of pics, but better some than none. My wife, my baby girl and I, took the Troll for a stroll around our capital – Ljubljana – here he is in front of the Ljubljana castle.
After a short walk we arrived at the Prešeren statue – a famous Slovenian poet, also the author of our national anthems lyrics.
The Troll is trolling the dragons 🙂 On the Dragon bridge.
So that was one of only two sunny days while the Troll was in Ljubljana, so the only thing left for me to do was to take it to the seaside. This is actually in Croatia as Slovenia only has about 45km of coast.
And here he is, getting ready to hunt some Giant, Cowboy, Redskin a** 🙂
If any Eagle fans are visiting Slovenia, you are more than welcome to send me a message via the author of this page, and I can get you some tips and we can meet and greet in person. #TrollEaglesTroll :)”
CHICAGO — The uncle of a Chicago teen accused of providing the gun used in the fatal shooting of a 14-year-old girl in a Facebook feud over a boy has been sentenced to 100 years in prison.
Judge Thaddeus Wilson sentenced 27-year-old Donnell Flora on Monday after he was found guilty of charges including first-degree murder in the April 28, 2014, slaying of Endia Martin. Prosecutors say Flora supplied the gun and accompanied his niece to the shooting.
Wilson told Flora “there are no excuses or rationalization for giving a child a gun to take to ridiculous fight about a boy.”

An offence of rape has been registered against a person for not honouring the promise of marriage he made to a woman, with whom he had a live-in relationship for about seven years, police said today.Based on a complaint filed by the 32-year-old woman, a teacher by profession, a case was registered yesterday against Bhalerian Ekka, Sanyogitaganj police said.The duo had a live-in relationship from 2007 to 2013 after Ekka, who used to work with the victim at a school hostel in the Residency area here, promised to marry her, the complainant said.However, later Ekka left for Chhattisgarh and married another woman there, she further mentioned. An offence under sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC has been registered against the man, police said, adding that a probe was on in the matter.
City officials are set to pay $50,000 to a local law firm to better train police officers on how to legally stop people they encounter, among other topics.
The Board of Estimates is expected to award the contract, to be funded through a federal grant, on Wednesday.
The firm, Warnken LLC, headed by University of Baltimore law professor Byron Warnken, was selected by the Baltimore state's attorney's office. The contract lasts from May 6 to June 30.
Warnken said he has created a 130-page document to train more than 300 police officers. His three sessions will be entitled, "Cars, Cops & Stops," "Seeking, Obtaining, and Executing Arrest Warrants and Search Warrants," and "Preparing for and Presenting Police Testimony in Court."
Warnken said city officials asked him to do the training prior to the national furor over the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray in police custody. Six officers are charged criminally in that case.
Warnken said officers will be selected at random to go through the 12-hour training program. He said he will be explaining Maryland law regarding "stops," "stops and frisks" and "what the police can do and should do."
"Maryland law holds that running in the sight of police is not enough for probable cause," he said. A charging document in Gray's case said police chased and detained him because "he fled unprovoked" from officers.
Rochelle Ritchie, a spokeswoman for State's Attorney Marilyn J. Mosby, said the training is designed to "improve case outcomes."
"Training has been a top priority of this administration and has been in the works since State's Attorney Mosby took office," Ritchie said.

There are some doctors' offices where you never expect to sit. In the reproductive endocrinologist's waiting room, the women sit straight-backed and tense, and casual conversation between patients doesn't happen. Some women leave smiling, but others leave in grim anxiety, or in quiet tears. Nobody looks at them, because sooner or later, that crying patient will probably be you.
I was 28 years old the summer I started infertility treatment. Popular misconceptions aside, I didn't spend my twenties and thirties focusing on other priorities while my eggs dried up. Something went amiss in the dark corners of my brain, and it was quickly obvious that I wasn't going to get pregnant without serious professional help. The next six months were full of miseries, large and small, as my doctors tried various unsuccessful treatments. We debated skipping straight to IVF, but eventually decided to first do intrauterine insemination (“artificial insemination,” or IUI) cycle, to see how I responded to the IVF medications.
Because we are incredibly and undeservedly fortunate, that “practice” cycle concluded in a pair of blue-eyed daughters, followed by a younger brother who came along as we pondered a return to that unpleasant waiting room. My children are five and three now, and grocery-store strangers no longer coo over the tiny babies before asking if they're “natural.” This November, though, those same strangers will be voting on a constitutional amendment which will decide what treatment options will be available in Mississippi for infertile women like me.
The only problem is that almost nobody knows it. The Personhood Amendment, MS26, is a deceptively simple sentence: “The term ‘person' or ‘persons' shall include every human being from the moment of fertilization, cloning or the functional equivalent thereof.” There's not a word about IVF, or about contraception, or about ectopic pregnancy treatment or miscarriages. Anyone who considers himself or herself pro-life will almost certainly reflexively agree with it.
The implications, though, are drastic. Because there's no established legal standard for what rights are conveyed by the term “personhood,” it can be applied as broadly as the state legislature and judicial system will support. Everyone, supporters and dissenters alike, agrees that it will prohibit elective abortion, the morning-after pill, and discarding frozen embryos. What else, though, might be prohibited under the same logic?
If the amendment as written will protect embryos from being deliberately and knowingly killed, this must derive from their being people with the right not to be murdered. However, do these “embryonic people” also have the right not to be handled in a manner which, if applied to newborn infants, would be considered negligent manslaughter or child endangerment?
21 Not-So-Simple Words
Unfortunately, IVF just doesn't really work all that well. 70% of the women who start an IVF cycle will not take home a baby nine months later. When those cycles fail, it is much easier and less expensive to use frozen embryos from a previous cycle than it is to create new embryos. Viable, healthy embryos are never discarded, because embryos are a precious resource. Every woman who undergoes IVF is viscerally aware that those embryos might, one day, be carefully wrapped in a blanket and tucked into a car seat for the first ride home. Many save pictures of their embryos, in the hope of making them the first entry in a baby book.
The process of embryo cryopreservation is a necessary part of IVF. Doctors aim to retrieve approximately 10 eggs from a woman undergoing IVF, knowing that only 25% will fertilize and develop into embryos which can be transferred back to the mother. In a typical cycle, two embryos are transferred, to give the mother the best chance at getting pregnant at all without risking high-order multiples. However, this isn't an exact science. There is no way to know in advance how many eggs will fertilize, or how many embryos will develop. If a woman has more embryos than can be transferred, doctors pick the two best, and freeze the remaining embryos for later use.
However, the sad fact is that about half of the embryos which are cryopreserved won't even survive the freezing and thawing process. We take healthy embryos and subject them to a process which offers no direct medical benefit to them, knowing that 50% of them will die in the process. Just imagine the parallel to healthy newborns: subjecting them to a medical treatment which doesn't offer any benefit to the babies, and which is known in advance to kill 50% of them.
Surely, if IVF embryos are people who possess the fundamental rights to life, such a thing could not possibly be allowed. Yet personhood advocates claim that the amendment (which, let's remember, does not say a word about IVF or frozen embryos) won't restrict access to IVF at all. That is, it will somehow distinguish between murder and manslaughter, and protect frozen embryos from being discarded while continuing to permit embryos to be frozen (and die during the process) in the first place.
Personally, I find the logical and scientific contradictions impossible to resolve. Nor has the pro-personhood campaign offered any better rationale than “IVF won't be restricted, because we said so.” Unfortunately, political ads don't carry any legal weight at all. Given that a large wing of the pro-life force is ideologically opposed to infertility treatment, I find myself unwilling to simply take their word for it.
The same contradictions are evident when we talk about ectopic pregnancy treatment. Significant controversy exists about the appropriate pro-life approach to ectopic pregnancy treatment. Some doctors are comfortable preemptively treating doomed pregnancies by using the chemotherapy drug methotrexate to induce a miscarriage. Others, notably Catholic physicians, do not believe in such direct intervention; they prefer to wait first for the pregnancy to end spontaneously, then if a rupture still threatens, to surgically treat the pregnancy by removing the Fallopian tube with the developing embryo still in place. This approach carries some very serious physical risks to the mother, up to and including death and infertility; but for many pro-life people, it's the only treatment compatible with the principle of double effect.
This even extends to contraception. Many pro-life people believe that the use of hormonal contraception and IUDs is incompatible with a view that life begins at conception, because of potential abortifacient effects. This view is by no means universal, but it's common enough that it's a fair question to ask whether personhood is incompatible with the Pill.
If the pro-life movement can't agree even amongst itself, how are women supposed to be able to trust that those 21 words will protect their access to contraception less drastic forms of ectopic pregnancy treatment? Would you be willing to bet your health and fertility on it, and sign away your rights in exchange for promises that the eventual implementation will still have the necessary exceptions? Do you trust the men (and a handful of women) of the Mississippi legislature to make exactly the same choices you would?
Taking Responsibility
The weeks and months after my husband and I were diagnosed with infertility were the most difficult period of our marriage to date. We circled around the grief by discussing specifics of treatments, knowing that the unspoken corollary was always “if it's the only way we can have a baby.” We weren't what you'd call comfortable with the idea of IVF, and the question of frozen embryos loomed large for us. Neither of us believe that embryos are fully equivalent to people, but we still agreed that we would owe them some degree of responsibility. We did not ultimately have to sign the dotted line for that decision, but we did agree to go through IVF, and had organized the specifics of money and scheduling.
One of the silver linings of infertility is that I know to a nicety where I stand. We put so much prayer and thought and argument into working out our choices, both for infertility treatment and for some of the potential pregnancy complications we might, and did, face. It's easy to say that you would never do X or Y in the abstract. It's another thing entirely when the tense shifts out of the conditional, and becomes “what WILL I do?”
It seems vaguely ludicrous to me that Mississippi voters now get to decide that for me, mostly without any understanding that they're doing so, and certainly without all the literal blood and tears and years of thought I spent on those questions. All I can do, once again, is prayed and talk, and hope that the right decision gets made in November.
Insects hit by loss of grassland habitats due to intensification of agriculture and abandonment of farming landSee the gallery of endangered species
Hundreds of butterflies, beetles and dragonflies are at risk of extinction across Europe with almost one-third of 435 butterfly species in decline, scientists have warned.
The loss of habitat caused by intensive farming, climate change, forest fires and the expansion of tourism is threatening with extinction 14% of dragonflies, 11% of saproxylic beetles and 9% of butterflies within Europe, according to the European red list report for the European commission.
"When talking about threatened species, people tend to think of larger, more charismatic creatures such as pandas or tigers, but we mustn't forget that the small species on our planet are just as important," said Jane Smart of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the conservation group which produced the report. "Butterflies, for instance, play a hugely pivotal role as pollinators in the ecosystems in which they live."
Many of the endangered insect species live in southern Europe where increasingly hot, dry summers combined with irrigation and water extraction is causing wetland habitats to dry up.
The Madeiran large white butterfly is listed as critically endangered on the red list, which reviews the status of 6,000 European species including mammals, reptiles and plants. But the butterfly may already be extinct because it has not been seen on the island of Madeira for 20 years.
The Macedonian grayling butterfly is critically endangered because quarrying is reducing its habitat while other endangered species include the Danube clouded yellow, the violet copper and the Canary Islands large white. Only 4% of Europe's butterfly species, which include 142 unique to the continent, are increasing in number.
Martin Warren, co-author of the butterfly section of the report and chief executive of UK charity, Butterfly Conservation, said the insects were being hit by the loss of grassland habitats due to both intensification of agriculture and recent abandonment of traditional farming land in Europe.
"In the 1950s and 60s we had massive losses of habitat in the UK, and it is still going on to a lesser extent, but in Europe big changes have been going on in the last five to 10 years," said Warren. We lost a lot of our flower-rich meadows in the 50s and 60s, while they are losing theirs at a rate of knots now."
The large blue butterfly, a rare conservation success after it was reintroduced in Devon and Somerset after it became extinct in the UK in 1979, is endangered throughout Europe, declining in every country where it occurs apart from the UK.
Other struggling species, such as the Duke of Burgundy and the Lulworth skipper, which both suffered their worst ever year in the UK last summer, are in decline in many countries across the continent.
Intensification of agriculture is destroying habitat in some areas, while flower and insect-rich pastures in many mountain regions in the Alps and Pyrenees are being abandoned and falling into a poor condition because livestock farming is not financially viable.
Warren called for more support for traditional farming systems to help insects such as butterflies, which he said were very good indicators of changes to the environment.
Saproxylic beetles, which depend on decaying wood in forests and play a crucial role in recycling nutrients, were assessed for the first time on the red list.
Logging, changing woodland management practices and a declining number of mature trees are threatening species such as the violet click beetle. Almost 11%, 46 of 431 species studied, are at risk of being lost to Europe and 7% are threatened with global extinction. A further 13% are listed as "near threatened" in Europe.
Almost a quarter of 137 dragonfly species assessed, including 18 species not found anywhere else in the world, were found to be at risk of extinction or "near threatened". Last year, a new dragonfly centre opened in the UK in a bid to reverse a trend of decline that has seen one-third of British species facing extinction.
We tracked down Jennifer Wenger, who has been modeling as the Amazonian princess for more than a decade, to find out.
Meet Jennifer Wenger, a girl from Tennessee turned Amazonian Princess who has been acting and modeling as Wonder Woman in Los Angeles since 2004. She goes out on the street as Wonder Woman, appears in comic book conventions, poses as a reference model for comics, does charity work, bodyguards Stan Lee and has performed in sketches on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!"
From the Grapevine sat down with Wenger to find out what it's like to work as a superheroine.

What are your thoughts on Israeli actress Gal Gadot playing Wonder Women in the upcoming "Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice" and "Wonder Woman" movies?
I heard [Wonder Woman comic writer] Gail Simon saw an early screening and said Wonder Woman was the highlight of the film. Nobody knows Wonder Woman like Simon. If she gives her stamp of approval, I'm probably gonna dig it.
When did you get into Wonder Woman?
When I was about 4 years old, I saw a contact lens commercial with [American actress] Lynda Carter, where she said, "I don't trust these baby blues to just anyone." And I was just in love with her. I asked my mom who she was, and she said, “That's Wonder Woman.”
Later on, I made my cheerleading team dress up like the Justice League for Octoberfest, so we did a big performance in front of our college. Cheerleading was sort of anti-nerd, but I went in and was like, “No, no, we're nerding this cheerleading thing out.”
What was it like to go out on Hollywood Boulevard?
When I went out the first time, I wasn't paying attention to how much I was making; when people gave me tips, I just stuffed them in my boots. After a while, my feet started to hurt, and I went home. I poured the money out of my boots, and I saw I'd made over $300 in a couple hours. So I was like, “Um, I'm gonna quit my job at Chuck E. Cheese's.”
And you model for comics too, right?
I remember going years ago to season one of “Game of Thrones.” There was this gorgeous poster of Khaleesi with dragons behind her, and I was like, “That is freaking stunning.” They were these limited edition posters for like $40 each, and I was like, “Ugh, I don't have the money for that. Who is this artist though? I have to always remember her.” And that was Tess Fowler.
And now Tess Fowler does “Rat Queens” and said online the other day, “Yeah, Hannah is based on Jennifer Wenger, the cosplayer known for doing Wonder Woman,” and I was like, “No. Way.” Because “Rat Queens” is so badass. It's total female empowerment. These chicks are kind of like antiheroes, and they have really rad personas. So to know that I'm one of the inspirations behind that is just super cool.
"Rat Queens" describes the adventures of four rowdy, foul-mouthed girls. Hannah, who was inspired by Wenger, is an elven mage. (Photo: Screenshot/YouTube)
What is it like to pose for comics?
The first time it happened, I was just walking around a con, and an artist for Disney chased me down, and he was like, “I'm so sorry, I need to take photos of your face because you have the face that we try to draw … So I let him, and when I posted online, “This is a cool thing that happened to me,” then other artists started messaging me.
Because you have the perfect face.
That's sweet. That Disney guy said that … He said, “You're sharp and you're soft at the same time.” That's how they want everyone to be drawn: feminine but strong.

Do you run into any challenges as Wonder Woman?
I do standup comedy, and sometimes my material is kind of blue, and sometimes my material is kind of crazy and zany. And people expect, since I'm Wonder Woman, for everything to be perfect. And, you know, it's just not.
And nobody can be Wonder Woman … Somebody destroyed her family, and she still doesn't kill. And she has more power than any other female on the planet, and she doesn't misuse it. Those things … They're not human capabilities. I'm a human.
Wenger: It's cool when people see a comic and are like "Hey!" and point back and forth from the comic to me and are like "That's totally you!” (Photo: Courtesy of Jennifer Wenger)
What do you love about Woman Woman?
Being a carbon copy of everybody else is boring. And I love that, right now, this is the generation where [being different] is celebrated. And I think that Wonder Woman really is a great example of [looking out for the underdog].
Now, she's hot. Of course, I was like, “Whoa!” when I saw Lynda Carter, and her boobs were bouncing, and she had a teeny little waist, and big hair, and red lips and piercing blue eyes. I was like, “Wow, that's a woman.” But once I learned the origin story, that's when I really fell in love with her. The way that she looks out for the little guy.

Did you ever do anything embarrassing?
There was one time where we were doing Jimmy Kimmel on live television, and they had this ridiculous stunt course they wanted us to do in our superhero outfits; it was like the winter superhero Olympics. I had never skied before in my life, and they had brought in all this fake snow, and the ramp was like a 90-degree ramp.
I got a start, and they're like, “Just go for it,” so I do, and of course I just bite it. I'm on the ground, and I'm like, “This is impossible, I can't even get up.” And I hear Steve Harvey going, “Wonder Woman's hot, she's thick as hell, she reminds me of my aunt.”
Wenger was prominently featured in 2007 documentary "Confessions of a Superhero," which was featured in South by Southwest (Photo: Screenshot/Youtube)

Stanford is on its longest break from games since December, and the Cardinal are keeping busy while they wait for Selection Monday to find out where the madness will begin.
The Cardinal flexed their defensive and rebounding muscles during the Pac-12 tournament, especially in the battle of attrition against Oregon State. But the focus in the gym this week is the offense, said head coach Tara VanDerveer.
“I really felt all year that this was a tournament team,” VanDerveer said, emphasizing the quality depth that allows the Cardinal to view up to seven players as “starters.”
“I thought in this tournament everyone expanded their game in a different way,” she said. "Bri (Roberson) was pushing the tempo more. Her defense was phenomenal, but she has been playing great defense all year. Marta (Sniezek) played great defense and her defense really stepped up in this tournament. Karlie (Samuelson) was really steady and she played a lot.
"Bird (Erica McCall) rebounded and played great defense. Kayl (Kaylee Johnson) scored for us above her average. Alanna (Smith) scored for us. Britt's (Brittany McPhee) passing was phenomenal against Washington State. Everyone stepped up in some aspect of their game.”
Johnson's performance in the semifinal win against Oregon (11 points, 12 rebounds and two blocks) was a welcome experience given the time she missed this season because of a stress fracture in her foot.
It wasn't until about “four or five games” into the season that Johnson and the Stanford staff realized the extent of the problem. After staying off the court for more than a month, Johnson said she felt like a freshman again while she tried to reacquaint herself with the rhythm of the game.
She credited her teammates and coaches for helping her stay positive.
“It's been frustrating … from the selfish, individual performance level it has been my least favorite season,” she said. “But overall, because of this team and every single girl, this has been my absolute favorite season. Even though I missed half of it I wouldn't trade it for anything. I would do it all over again if I could because I love them so much. I'm really excited to see what we can do.”
Johnson is a key part of Stanford's steadfast defense, which has several players capable of matching up against a variety of different kinds of scorers. Samuelson, who may one day become a coach, said one reason Stanford is so effective is what VanDerveer refers to as "scout defense."
“We just like to take away what the other team does best and that's all Tara and our coaches,” she said. “They really look into things. We had similar plans when we played them (Oregon State) earlier in the season, but we tweaked some things and we tweaked the right things.”
Samuelson's defensive intensity has been a strength since she was a kid playing against her sisters, Bonnie and Katie Lou. She described her sisters as better offensive players, so Karlie needed to be a tough defender.
But Samuelson has expanded her scoring ability, which has always been among the league's best from the two lines, free throw and three-point. And she has a knack for swinging momentum when measured by one unofficial statistic: After at least 10 plays this season in which she made a shot, had an assist or took a charge, the opposing team took a timeout.
“She's in a lot of great plays,” VanDerveer said. “She's a very heady player. She's a very unselfish player. She's really a very skilled player. The main thing is she's playing really, really well.”
Another unofficial strength that goes beyond statistics for the Cardinal is the impact of benergy.
For those who don't follow in the age of jamming words together to make new ones, that term is the combination of bench and energy. A staple of Stanford women's basketball, VanDerveer refers to it often and it was notably on display in the tournament.
While she was injured Johnson was a "benergy leader," but there is now controversy about her place on the All-Benergy team.
“They said I was kicked off of the benergy team because I started,” she laughed.
“D (Dijonai Carrington) has the funniest celebrations. She's always over there swinging her arms and she's on the court half the time celebrating. Shannon (Coffee) is up there. Shannon is very photogenic. She takes the best photos during her celebrations.
"There's not a benergy MVP. Even when the starters are off (the court) they're cheering for everyone who goes in. I think that is why benergy is benergy and it works. It's not just one person doing it.”
The Cardinal know they are only guaranteed one more game to showcase their benergy, defensive intensity and the it-can-be-anyone-any-night offense.
“There's nothing more motivating than that,” Johnson said. “I think it becomes really visible when you see we do have this chemistry and we are in a rhythm. I think that's going to be really important.”
NASA's Spirit rover should be able to wriggle free of its sandy trap on Mars after all, says a scientist for the mission. But the robotic explorer will need to survive the bitter Martian winter first.
In April 2009, Spirit's wheels broke through a thin surface crust and got mired in the loose sand below. After months of trying unsuccessfully to free the rover, NASA declared on 26 January that Spirit would henceforth be a stationary lander mission rather than a rover.
But the announcement was “a little bit premature”, rover scientist Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, told researchers at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston, Texas, on Monday.
In nine drives between 15 January and 8 February, mission members coaxed the rover into driving backwards by 34 centimetres – “pretty good for a lander”, Arvidson said. That far surpasses the mere millimetres of motion Spirit had managed in previous efforts.

The technique involved swivelling the rover wheels from side to side, which cleared away some of the loose soil beneath the wheels and compacted what remained. By alternating wheel swivelling with short drives, the rover was able to make slow and steady progress.
“We only stopped because we ran out of sunlight” as winter approached, Arvidson said. Spirit is hibernating now, with too little power to continue driving. “After we come out from hibernation in September or October, my suspicion is that a couple weeks [of driving] and we'll back out [of the trap],” he said.
But first Spirit will have to survive the cruel Martian winter. In previous winters, it was able to park on slopes that tilted its solar panels northwards, maximising the amount of sunlight falling on them at Spirit's location in the southern hemisphere of Mars.
This time around, Spirit's solar panels are tilted slightly to the south, which means power is likely to drop lower than ever before in the mission. That could leave Spirit with too little juice to warm its electronics, and they could break if they get too cold. “It will be dicey,” Arvidson admits.

Recent days have brought unmistakable signs that Israel is becoming a hot potato issue inside the Democratic base, and on Saturday Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon was repeatedly put on the defensive at a town hall at a Portland high school for his support of the Anti Israel Boycott Act, which would criminalize some forms of supporting boycott of Israel.
Wyden, who has a reputation for supporting civil rights, got flustered by hecklers and questioners. He said that he was “pummeled” by the matter and sought to assure the audience the law protects free speech and only applies to support for a foreign government's boycott. “Say like the Arab League. If you're working with foreign government, that's essentially what we restricted in the past.”
A young person challenged the senator, to applause:
“What's the impetus behind the bill? What are the behaviors that merited this bill's existence?”
Wyden said:
I believe the concern is that the boycott movement has grown. I happen to believe that there is a line to be drawn between protecting the rights of the individuals, that's why I described all the things that I've researched that a person can do that speak to your First Amendment rights. I think that's different than being part of a boycott with the Arab League, that's the distinction.
Later Wyden conceded that the bill could also apply to a boycott measure urged by the United Nations.
The Israeli government and pro-Israel lobby groups here have expressed fears about the growth of the boycott movement (BDS). Leaders of the boycott campaign say that it has gained traction because of Israel's own conduct, including maintaining an occupation for 50 years and colonizing Palestinian areas with illegal settlements.
Wyden stressed that as a journalist's son, he had made sure that 7 or 8 traditional forms of free expression are protected by the bill. The bill is based on a forty year history of anti-boycott legislation, for which “nobody has ever gone to jail.” Wyden was referring to laws against complying with the Arab League boycott of Israel passed by Congress in the '70s.
The Israel angle dominated news coverage of Wyden's town hall. “Wyden pressed on Israeli anti-boycott legislation, talks healthcare at Wilson High,” says the Oregonian. While the Portland Tribune headline says, “Wyden defends support of Israel boycott proposal: ‘no one has gone to jail'.” Jewish Insider and Haaretz have also grabbed the story.
The pushback against Wyden follows two Democratic senators going wobbly on Israel. Last week NY Senator Kirsten Gillibrand took her name off the anti-boycott legislation. She was promptly targeted by the Israel lobby group AIPAC; but when a questioner mentioned her stance at the Wyden town hall, Gillibrand got applause.
Also last week NJ Senator Cory Booker voted against a pro-Israel bill to cut off money to the Palestinian Authority over its support for families of people who have violently resisted the occupation.
Even Israel advocates have said there is a political calculus in these moves. “Democrats Who Want to be President Back Away from Israel” was the headline at the National Review, by Jonathan Tobin. While Noah Pollak the writer formerly associated with the Emergency Committee for Israel said Booker was making “a political decision — a choice to associate himself with the Linda Sarsour wing of the party, which he believes is ascendant.”
The Linda Sarsour wing was out in force at Wilson High School in Portland on Saturday. While Wyden was cheered for helping to block the destruction of Obamacare and the senator took a progressive stance against the Trump administration on immigration and healthcare, he got four or five questions on the Anti-Israel Boycott Act, which is opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union as a violation of the First Amendment.
Here are some of the exchanges from the Oregonian's tape:
Wyden asks a questioner what sign he is holding, and the man says it says, “I support Palestinian human rights.” The man then challenges Wyden, “Congress as you know should be vigilant in protecting First Amendment rights. In this case, you don't seem to be. I'd ask you to uphold my First Amendment rights by removing your name as a cosponsor of Senate bill 720.”
That question gets a big round of applause, and Wyden says, “This is exactly what town hall meetings are for,” then adds, “I happen to be one of the strong supporters of the two-state solution.”
It sounds like he gets booed or mocked for that, and a woman calls out, “Get to the point!”
Wyden responds by describing what “you can and can't do” if the bill is passed. You still have free speech, he says. As the son of a journalist, “I do not take a back seat to anybody in terms of fighting for the First Amendment.”
As we have read the bill, it means that anybody in this audience can boycott Israeli products or say they intend to boycott Israeli products… If you want to pull out your cell phone… you are completely free to tweet about supporting the BDS [boycott, divestment and sanctions] program. You can post any criticism of Israel on your Facebook page, write an op-ed about your views for a newspaper, walk up and down your street with a megaphone, organize a big picnic in your back yard…
He states that the bill “doesn't prevent or punish anyone who makes those choices,” and he's researched the limits of the bill by “talking to scholars.”
As for what you can't do under the law, Wyden then refers to 40 years of legislation to prevent compliance with boycotts of Israel.
What you can't do under the bill, and it builds on 40 years long, is you can't work with a foreign government to promote the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions legislation. In that sense it builds on a 40 year law…. That's my take, and I spent a lot of time dissecting this…
Wyden continues to get pushback from several other questioners.
“I believe I speak for many of your constituents who are very concerned,” one says. “The bill you are referring to has been interpreted by constitutional experts including the ACLU as unconstitutional. How could you possibly support a bill that is so questionable in its constitutionality…. We urge you to do as Kirsten Gilllibrand has just done… remove your endorsement of this bill.”
As Gillibrand is cheered, Wyden protests, “She didn't support it in its current form. She didn't say she opposed it altogether.”
Later, Wyden appears to vacillate somewhat. He tells the audience “Let's stay at it” to generate more information about the bill. “Let's try and find out more information.”
He insists that, “No one has said Gee that's wrong.”
More hecklers. “The ACLU!”
“The ACLU is opposed to the bill, but they haven't said [unintelligible],” Wyden adds.
Wyden said he had researched the history of the law barring compliance with the Arab boycott of Israel and found that “nobody has ever gone to jail” for supporting boycott of Israel.
Another questioner pushes back against Wyden's answer, saying, to considerable applause:
The ACLU does directly contradict things you've said on stage today. If the UN Human Rights Council calls for a boycott of Israeli settlements, I would face criminal penalties of up to 20 years in prison. That is not acceptable… It's also Moveon, it's J Street, it's Jewish Voice for Peace…. Our free speech is jeopardized.
Wyden seems to quail.
We have asked repeatedly from all sources for information about how anyone has faced jail, criminal penalties like jail, and no one has been able to give us one example.
Hecklers shout responses, and Wyden gets nettled.
Whoa whoa…It's built on a 40-year law sir… Let me make you an invitation, If you got an example of how somebody was put in jail under this..
The questioner points out that he's talking about an existing law, and the Congress is seeking to amend the law, to change that.
Wyden wants to change the subject:
I have I think probably at least for purposes of today pummelled everything that I can say. I would invite you and welcome your input. We've had a law on the books for 40 years that prevents American commercial activity from participating in concerted boycotts led by foreign governments and I guess it could involve the U.N. But we cannot find one instance of anybody being put in jail.
Ron Wyden is Jewish and his parents escaped Nazi Germany. He cited this background during discussions of the Iran Deal, which he supported, though he expressed concerns about Iran's alleged threat to destroy Israel.

RICHMOND Va. (Reuters) – A federal judge on Friday rejected defense motions that former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell and his wife be acquitted in their corruption and bribery trial.
U.S. District Judge James Spencer turned down the bids after a one-hour hearing. The motions came after prosecutors wrapped up their case against McDonnell, a Republican, and his wife after almost three weeks of testimony.
Defense lawyers are expected to start calling witnesses on Monday. The McDonnells face a 14-count indictment alleging they accepted more than $165,000 in loans and gifts from businessman Jonnie Williams Sr. in exchange for promoting his dietary supplement company Star Scientific Inc and its main product, Anatabloc.
McDonnell said after Spencer's ruling that he was looking forward to Monday to be able to tell his story.
“Obviously this is crushing to be a defendant in a criminal case. But I know in my heart what the truth is,” McDonnell, 60, told reporters outside the courthouse.
Lawyers for McDonnell had argued that prosecutors failed to show that he carried out or promised to carry out any official act for Williams.
The former governor's lawyers also said the government had failed to prove that McDonnell made a false statement on a TowneBank loan application by not disclosing a loan from Williams on a personal financial statement.
Maureen McDonnell's lawyers argued that the governor had not carried out any official acts for Williams and the former first lady cannot be guilty as a private citizen.
They also said prosecutors failed to show she made a false statement on a loan application to Pentagon Federal Credit Union or tried to obstruct a grand jury proceeding.
Lawyers for the McDonnells have contended that the couple could not have conspired with Williams because their marriage was crumbling and they were not on speaking terms.
Defense lawyers have listed 121 potential witnesses for the couple, twice the number prosecutors had listed. Jurors were given Friday off.
McDonnell's four-year term ended in January. If the McDonnells are convicted, each could face a prison sentence of 20 years and hefty fines.

Last week, we published an article about Asian-American actors fighting for diversity in Hollywood. Hundreds of readers from the United States and around the world responded by submitting comments. Here are some of the most thoughtful — and provocative. They have been edited and condensed.
‘Asians Are Still Fairly Invisible'
Readers discussed how the lack of Asian-Americans in Hollywood has affected their lives and careers.
Joanna from New York recalled taking her two mixed-race children to see the film adaptation of “The Martian” after reading the book: “I was excited to take my kids to see the movie. Unfortunately, I was more than a little disappointed that an obviously Korean Mindy Park in the book was looking as white and blond as she did.”
Carol from Victoria, British Columbia, a fourth-generation North American of Japanese descent, recalled growing up in the 1950s without images of Asians in the media “other than some white guy with something painful shoved up his eyes, playing in old Charlie Chan films.” She continued: “Now I am in my 60s and am disappointed to see how little has basically changed over the years. Asians are still fairly invisible.”

Ever since the departures of Rams wide receivers Torry Holt and Isaac Bruce from St. Louis, the Rams have been searching desperately for that number one receiver.
From Donnie Avery, to hopeful Danario Alexander, and finally Brandon Llyod, the Rams have struggled to find that guy. The Rams now have Chris Givens and Brian Quick who very well could add their names to that list.
Replacing great players like Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt is never an easy task, but nobody could have expected it to be this hard. The Rams replaced Steven Jackson just one year after he left, how could finding a number one receiver be so difficult?
Finding that number one receiver has been difficult though, and for the sixth consecutive season, the Rams failed to have a 1,000-yard receiver, tied for the second longest drought in the NFL.
Call it bad drafting, but in reality, some of it has just been simple bad luck. In the years that a top elite wide receiver has been in the draft, the Rams seem to have a pick in the middle of the first round, and the years the Rams have had a pick atop the first round, there were no elite receivers worthy of a high draft pick.
In 2007 when Calvin Johnson came out, the Rams held the 13th overall pick. In 2008, the highest receiver went 33rd overall and the Rams drafted him, Donnie Avery. In Avery's second season he tore his ACL and never played another snap in a Rams uniform.
After having the number two and number one overall picks in 2009 and 2010, the Rams drafted 14 overall only to have A.J. Green and Juilo Jones get drafted at number four and number six.
In 2012 the Rams got jumped by Jacksonville who got Justin Blackmon, but settled for Brian Quick in the second round, only to have 1,000 yard receivers Alshon Jeffrey go to Chicago a few picks later. Finally in 2013 St. Louis had enough and drafted up to get Tavon Austin, and yet still, the Rams are without that number one receiver.
Last season, Austin led Rams wide receivers with 40 catches. To find the last time the Rams' leading wide receiver had fewer catches in a season, one must go all the way back to 1986. That year, Henry Ellard led the entire club with just 34 catches.
Givens led the Rams with 569 receiving yards this season. Again, it's Ellard in 1986 for the last time a Rams wideout led with fewer receiving yards (447).
Is this going to be one of the great curses of professional sports? The Curse of the Bambino, The Curse of Billy Penn, or worst of all The Curse of the Billy Goat. Is this the curse of the Greatest Show on Turf? Are the Rams now suffering for having such a great receiving corps for such a long time?
How do the Rams stop this drought? Do the Rams stay patient, keep working with the youngsters and look for better days from the group? Or do they go the other way? Keep drafting or trying to upgrade the position through trades or free agency until they get it right?
The good news is, for the first time in a while, the Rams have some luck headed into the 2014 NFL draft. The Rams hold two picks in the first round, one of which being in the top five. Thankfully for the Rams, there may finally be a receiver worthy of being taken in the top five when they are drafting in the top five in Clemson wide receiver Sammy Watkins.
Even if the Rams miss out on Watkins, Marquise Lee and Mike Evans would be options when the Rams select at 13 overall, both of which also can be number one options on the outside.
Adding Watkins would give the Rams an elite force on the outside, something they have desperately needed. The Rams had hoped Brian Quick would be that force, but two years in, he just hasn't produced. How much longer can you wait?
Adding another guy on the outside that defenses would have to respect could open things up for Chris Givens on the opposite side. Chris Givens had a down year in 2013, but I wouldn't say it's time to give up on him just yet.
In all of Bradford's time in St. Louis he hasn't had a true number one receiver, Watkins would be just that right off of the bat. The Rams have been searching for an answer at wide receiver for the past six years, Sammy Watkins could just be the answer.
Adding a veteran wide receiver in free agency might not be a bad idea as well. The Rams don't have to go after one of the top receivers, but adding a veteran presence in the locker room wouldn't be a bad idea.
One of this team's biggest needs this offseason is a number one wide receiver. It's time to break this curse. In order for this offense to take their game to the next level, a number one receiver, whether they get it through the draft or free agency, is crucial.

BMW Group Financial Services Creates "The Ultimate Drive" Mobile App – Provides Social and Mobile Experience for Customers and Gamers Alike
Industry-First in Social Navigation Leverages New Communication Channels for BMW Financial Services' Customers While Driving Brand Loyalty
Woodcliff Lake, NJ – August 10, 2011 – The age of "gamification" has come, and BMW Group Financial Services is bringing this social nuance to its customer base of nearly 1 million individuals. Beginning with the development of a new and unique mobile and social experience, "The Ultimate Drive," is a social navigation mobile app that allows users to not only discover the best roads to drive in over 50 countries, but to rank, comment and share those roads via Facebook, email or other GPS devices. Future versions will integrate the ability for BMW Financial Service customers to gain points and achieve high rankings. As the first automotive channel, and specifically captive finance organization, to create a branded social navigation tool, BMW Group Financial Services defines itself as a consistent touch point with customers, through an engaging and interactive means.
"As a company, we pride ourselves on our ongoing uses of technology to build stronger relationships with our customers," said Ed Robinson, President and CEO for BMW Group Financial Services. "Not only does 'The Ultimate Drive' app allow us to broaden our awareness as an organization to a vast audience, but more so, it provides us the ability to nurture a two-way dialogue with our customers in an engaging way."
According to Pawan Murthy, General Manager of Online Business for BMW Group Financial Services, "The Ultimate Drive" is an example of how a captive financial services company can use mobile and social strategies as a consistent touch-point to customers while fostering a connection with BMW vehicles and the global BMW brand.
"A social app succeeds when it forms a community of users with similar interests. A mobile app succeeds when it shrinks that large community into something local and familiar," said Murthy. "Within a few seconds of opening the app, 'The Ultimate Drive' connects you to driving enthusiasts who have discovered great roads in your neighborhood – roads you may have overlooked. Sharing that joy of discovery is why we are eager to launch this app to everyone."
San Francisco-based software and technology firm, SocialNav, Inc., developed the technology that powers "The Ultimate Drive". "We've found that the success of applications like 'The Ultimate Drive' is built on organic growth amongst friends and enthusiasts with similar profiles," said Daniel Pifko, CEO and Co-Founder of SocialNav. "BMW Financial Services is an exceptional partner because it is at the forefront of using smartphones to improve the driving experience. We're excited about the relationship and have great ideas for many more things to come."
While utilizing the latest in navigation technology, "The Ultimate Drive" still remains simple in nature and nearly effortless to use to its full potential – after downloading the app, the user allows the app to find their location and then it displays the stretches of road which others have contributed as the best ones in the area. Conversely, when the user has generated their own favorite stretch, it is as easy as three taps to share via email or Facebook or send to one's favorite GPS device or app.
"The Ultimate Drive" is available for both iOS and Android devices. It can be downloaded for free from Apple's App Store and the Android Marketplace and is meant to broaden the social community around driving.
BMW Group Financial Services is currently developing similar versions for its MINI Motoring and BMW Motorrad brands, and will be extending all applications for its financial service customers in the near future.
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli police say a court has extended the arrest of a 19-year-old American-Israeli Jew suspected in recent bomb threats against U.S. Jewish community centers.
Police say they are keeping the suspect in custody for another week and placing his father under house arrest. A court has banned the publication of their names.
Israeli media say the suspect's father told the court on Thursday that his son spent hours alone in his room on the computer and that he was unaware of any suspicious behavior.
The suspect's lawyer argues a growth in his brain may have affected his behavior. Police say his motives are unclear.
The suspect's arrest followed an Israeli investigation with the FBI and other international law enforcement agencies. The bomb threats stoked fears of anti-Semitism in the U.S.
The latest man to jump over the fence at the White House is from Bel Air, according to media reports, including MSNBC.
Dominic Adesanya, 23, was taken into custody on the North Lawn on Tuesday evening after he was tackled by officers and dogs, according to MSNBC.
Adesanya was unarmed and charges are pending, according to The Washington Post. He was transported to an area hospital with a dog bite, the paper reported.
In video of the incident, Adesanya can be seen punching the dogs as the animals tried to subdue him. The two dogs have been taken to a veterinarian for injuries, according to The New York Times.
According to MileSplit Maryland, Adesanya was a competitive sprinter at Stevenson University, and participated in relay races, according to Athletic.net.
A Linked In user identified as "Dominic Adesanya" of the Baltimore area lists his profession as "American Slave."
In September Omar Gonzalez allegedly jumped the fence at the White House and made it deep into the building before he was tackled by an off-duty agent. If convicted, Gonazlez could face up to 15 years in prison, according to MSNBC.

Gen. Chen Bingde's instincts on how to battle piracy are sound. Hopefully his, and his political superiors', strategic judgment is equally sound. “For counterpiracy campaigns to be effective,” declared the chief of the People's Liberation Army General Staff, “we should probably move beyond the ocean and crash their bases on the land.” He wants to lop the head off the snake. “It's important,” argued Chen, “that we target not only the operators, those on the small ships or craft conducting the hijacking activities, but also the figureheads.” And indeed, taking more offensive, more decisive action makes intuitive sense – so much so that in late 2008, as the international community bestirred itself to combat piracy, the United Nations explicitly authorized member states to act against coastal villages from which corsairs stage sea raids.
Of late, the international community has remained mum about carrying the fight ashore. Since 2008, periodic U.N. Security Council resolutions renewing the counterpiracy mission's mandate have made no mention of it. That's probably because few political or military leaders are enthusiastic about putting boots on the ground in Somalia. It has no constituency within the Security Council. Why should U.N. ambassadors endure the hassle of negotiating potentially controversial language if no one intends to act on it? If Beijing is serious about offensive action, nevertheless, it can probably convince the council to renew the mandate for land operations. There is precedent.
Assailing pirate bases appears lawful, but is it wise? There's the rub. I've urged constabulary forces to stay on the strategic defensive in the Gulf of Aden unless the situation worsens dramatically. That hasn't happened. Statistically speaking, maritime brigandage remains a nuisance relative to the massive volume of shipping through the western Indian Ocean. There were 27 hijackings, 17 boardings, and 122 foiled attacks last year by the Office of Naval Intelligence's count. Compare that to the roughly 20,000 ships that transit regional sea lanes each year. NATO, the European Union, a U.S.-led task force, and several independent naval contingents patrol these waters in an effort to keep an “internationally recommended transit corridor” clear of pirate vessels. But the Gulf is so big, the adversary so dispersed, and the number of warships so modest that the multinational squadron is spread thin. Consequently, the best way to protect shipping is for ships to defend themselves. To date no merchantman defended by an armed detachment – usually from a private security firm hired by the shipper – has successfully been hijacked.
While defensive measures are wearisome, the offensive strategy Chen Bingde prescribes would entail hazards of its own – which is why careful forethought should go into any decision to attack piracy at its source. Strategic theorist Carl von Clausewitz maintains that the value statesmen place on their political aims should govern how many lives and how much treasure a belligerent expends on an enterprise, and for how long. The higher the stakes, the greater the effort. Clausewitzian cost/benefit logic warns against paying a heavy price for meager gains. Piracy is bothersome but poses too small a threat to justify a prolonged, costly entanglement on China's – or anyone else's – part. If the stakes are low but Beijing decides to go ashore anyway, its challenge will be to design expeditionary operations that fulfill its goals at low cost and risk.
Chen entertains two basic approaches: assaults on bases and targeted strikes at pirate chieftains. To my mind, the latter makes a better fit for a venture driven by modest political objectives. Vice Admiral Mark Fox, commander of the Bahrain-based U.S. Fifth Fleet, has proposed applying the counterterror model to Somali piracy. That presumably involves everything from gathering actionable intelligence to unraveling pirate finances to taking down key leaders. Admiral Fox sees such an approach as natural given mounting evidence of collusion between the corsairs and al-Shabab, an al-Qaeda-affiliated terror group striving to topple the Somali Transitional Federal Government. “Al-Shabab is responsible for a lot of training activity and camps and that sort of thing in Somalia,” notes Fox. “The pirates use these things. There cannot be a segregation between terrorist activity, in my mind, and counterpiracy.”
Counterterrorism is one “economy of force” option, but other low-cost, low-risk alternatives are available as well. Last Friday, the European Union took one commonsense step. In the course of renewing Operation Atalanta, the EU naval contingent off the Horn of Africa, EU defense ministers empowered naval commanders cruising along Somali shores to take boats, fuel dumps, and other targets of opportunity under fire. Chen's ambitious vision of completely eradicating pirate bases is more problematic. Putting a permanent end to this scourge would seemingly require Chinese soldiers or marines to go ashore – and stay there. Coastal raids would do little good. Villages could be cleared readily enough, but would they stay cleared? In all likelihood the brigands, already a dispersed lot, would simply scatter at the approach of foreign troops and return later. History has been unkind to the come-and-go approach. On the other hand, establishing a sustained presence along the coast would start to resemble a counterinsurgency campaign, with all the hardships and perils that mode of warfare entails.
That's not a choice Chinese leader should relish. One hopes Beijing undertakes some hardnosed Clausewitzian thinking before seizing the offensive against piracy.
James Holmes is an associate professor of strategy at the US Naval War College. He traveled to The Hague in 2009 to brief EU Naval Force commanders on counterpiracy strategy. The views voiced here are his alone.

IAFF Local 36 reports on Twitter that DC Fire & EMS Department Ambulance 25 was struck by this vehicle arpund 2:00 this afternoon at 13th Street and Southern Avenue, Southeast adjacent to United Medical Center. The vehicle in the picture overturned and caught fire. The driver is reported dead. Two firefighters aboard Ambulance 25 were taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
More from Peter Hermann at The Washington Post:
Nearly two hours after the accident, authorities were unable to confirm many details. A D.C. police spokesman said there was a “possible fatality.” Lon Walls, the communication director for the D.C. Fire Department, said a battalion chief at the scene reported one death.
Walls said a car struck an ambulance that was stopped at a red light. Two paramedics were taken to a hospital and treated for minor injuries, according to Walls; the car that hit their ambulance overturned and burst into flames, officials said.
A child who was trapped in one of the cars, police said, but was pulled out.
Hyper-Deflation on the Streets of Paris
Scarcely a block from our office in Paris is a monetary phenomenon that has escaped the financial press. In one of the highest-cost economies in the world, you can buy a woman's shirt for 2 euros. A dress? Four euros. A man's jacket can be had for the price of a cup of coffee.
The shop is tended by Chinese merchants…apparently dodging France's employment laws by only hiring family members. The merchandise, too, dodges high rents by squatting the sidewalk, under improvised blue awnings.
How come such cheap duds in such a dear city? The latest figures show negative consumer price inflation in 14 countries. In Ireland prices are collapsing at a 4.7% rate. In the United States, they are falling at 1.3% annually – their biggest drop in 59 years. In Britain, consumer price inflation is still positive…but falling. But clothing on the Boulevard de la Villette seems to have been thrown out of an airplane. It is not in deflation; it is in hyper-deflation.
What could cause it? A guess: excess capacity, inspired by excesses of credit, consumption and claptrap during the Bubble Epoque. Spurred by what seemed like insatiable demand from the United States and Britain, Asians built superfluous factories…Greeks bought superfluous ships…and Americans built superfluous malls. Now, the feet are in the other shoes – the cheap ones. The action of the bubble years produces an equal and opposite reaction: excess supply bedevils the market. Unable to sell superfluous brand name clothing, the rag trade strips off the alligators and polo sticks and dumps clothes on discount racks.
Last week, we warned about the extremely destabilizing effects of hyperinflation. One day middle class men are saving money for their daughters' dowries. The next, they are putting knives between their teeth and swimming across the Rhine.
Today, we deny hyperinflation thrice before the cock crows…and then deny we denied it. First, Professor Alan Blinder in The New York Times: “the clear and present danger, both now and for the next year or two, is not inflation but deflation.”
Second, BusinessWeek elaborates:
“…the inflationary effects of the new money are being fully offset, or more than offset, by the far-reaching and long-lasting impact of household debt repayments. Whether it's voluntary frugality or under the coercion of creditors, Americans have abruptly switched from living beyond their means to saving more and working down the debts they incurred during the bubble years.”
Third, as Ambrose Evans Pritchard puts it in the Telegraph: “the Fed's efforts to boost the money supply are barely keeping pace with the deflation shock. Stimulus is not gaining traction. The credit system is broken.”
Professor Blinder explains why:
“In normal times, banks don't want excess reserves, which yield them no profit. So they quickly lend out any idle funds they receive. Under such conditions, Fed expansions of bank reserves lead to expansions of credit and the money supply and, if there is too much of that, to higher inflation. In abnormal times like these, however, providing frightened banks with the reserves they demand will fuel neither money nor credit growth – and is therefore not inflationary.”
Reserves are what nobody wanted in the bubble years; now we live in a world of squirrels. Bankers add to their reserves; so do individuals and businesses. Americans saved an average of 7% of disposable income since the '30s. In the 2002-2007 bubble, that rate fell to zero. Now, it's back to nearly 5% and rising. Thrift is making a comeback. People are changing their own automobile oil. They are cutting their own hair and planting their own gardens.
When consumers cease consuming, producers cease producing. And shippers have nothing to ship. World trade has collapsed by more than it did at this stage of the Great Depression. And at 65% of capacity, there are more idle factories in America than at any time since they stopped making tanks and airplanes after WWII. Business earnings are falling, with no pricing power in sight. In this respect, this downturn is much more deflationary than Japan's recession of the '90s. When Japan went into a slump, the rest of the world continued to grow. Japan could continue to manufacture and export products – at a profit. Still, with so much excess capacity, producer prices in Japan fell in nine of 10 years in the '90s.
And now the denial: These commentators are right; deflation is the immediate problem. Our guess is that it will be deeper and more vexing than even they believe. The feds' money machine is broken. They can add reserves. But they can't turn the reserves into price inflation at the consumer level. Result: deflation…maybe hyper-deflation. But far from eliminating the danger of hyperinflation, falling prices practically guarantees it. In other words, it's not inflation we worry about; it's the lack of it. Unable to stimulate inflation in the usual way, the feds are forced to resort to extraordinary measures.
Only central banks with their backs against the wall – like Germany in the '20s…Argentina in the '80s…and Zimbabwe in the '00s…would dare to risk hyperinflation. But if its efforts to produce mild inflation don't work, the United States will eventually be in the same desperate position.
Enjoy your weekend,

The Daily Reckoning
In making demands on Ottawa, cities are hobbled by tradition and the constitution David Crombie has no illusions about any role the federal government might play in the life of Canadian cities.
David Crombie, former Toronto mayor and former MP, says "Ottawa has no connection to or institutional memory of cities." ( Randy Risling / Toronto Star file photo )
“If Toronto went out of business tomorrow, the federal government would say: ‘Oh, that's too bad,' ” says the former Toronto mayor and cabinet minister under Joe Clark and Brian Mulroney. “Ottawa has no connection to or institutional memory of cities. The whole notion that big cities gets together and the federal government pays attention to them overlooks one thing — the constitution.” In Canada, cities are creatures of the provinces. Even the best intentions, Crombie points out, don't survive. In 1974, Pierre Trudeau created a Minister of State for Urban Affairs and Housing, a position that lasted only a few years. “All that was left,” Crombie notes, “was the CMHC (Central Mortgage and Housing Corp).”

The secret to getting the federal government's attention, he explains, “is to create a constituency that it can't ignore.” One of the most celebrated examples of inter-government co-operation, the St. Lawrence Neighbourhood, dates from the 1970s. “We created a sense that the city was important,” Crombie explains. “We brought the federal and provincial governments together. Cities are all different places. What matters aren't just the relationships you build, but also the relationships you build with constituents.” Architect and planner Alan Littlewood cut his teeth at St. Lawrence, the large, mixed-income residential enclave rightly hailed as a paragon of the public sector working in partnership. “It could not have been done without direct and indirect federal support,” he says. The federal minister at the time, Donald Macdonald, “was directly involved. There was backup through the whole system. Money was available for rebuilding and infrastructure. “My impression was that the Liberals under Trudeau eventually backed away from cities because they were accused of interfering. When Mulroney got in, an ideological change took place to withdraw and let cities take care of themselves.”
In his latest book, How We Changed Toronto: The inside story of twelve creative, tumultuous years in civic life, 1969–1980, another former mayor, John Sewell, recalls the genesis of the federal housing programs that made St. Lawrence possible. It begins with Trudeau's minority government of 1972, one in which the NDP under David Lewis held the balance of power. “When Trudeau and Lewis talked about hammering out a deal that allowed Trudeau to govern,” Sewell writes, “it included . . . a powerful new housing program . . . (that) provided grants and mortgages to non-profits and non-profit co-operatives to buy land and build and operate housing.

“Without this new program, none of our housing initiatives would have gotten off the ground . . . The program was so popular that when Trudeau did manage to achieve a majority in the election in July 1974, the housing program was strengthened, not cancelled.” In Crombie's parlance, housing had become the constituency. Decades later, when Waterfront Toronto was launched in 2000 with $500 million each from federal, provincial and municipal governments, the “constituency” was the 2008 Olympics, the sort of thing senior levels of government care about. More recently, Jim Flaherty, federal finance minister from 2006 to 2014, showed more than usual interest in Toronto. “He was a good man,” Crombie says. “Early on, he understood the importance of cities.” Flaherty was quick to get on board with Evergreen Brick Works and made waterfront revitalization a personal priority. Despite the fact Canada is overwhelmingly an urban nation, cities remain largely impotent. Until the City of Toronto Act was passed in 2006 — by the provincial government — speed limits couldn't be altered or traffic-calming devices installed without Queen's Park approval. Though Toronto has since been granted more legal independence, it never received the revenue-raising powers — income and sales tax — it desperately needs. Sadly, trying to finance a city on property taxes alone gets us where we are today; unable to pay our way. -

THE 1 PER CENT SOLUTION Joe Pennachetti, Toronto's recently retired city manager thinks municipalities fiscal problems can be fixed if they received 1 per cent of the harmonized sales tax. Toronto's share would be $576 million. The Problem – Part 1: Property taxes funded 20th century cities — barely. This was a revenue source to fund core municipal services (roads, garbage, water, parks and recreation) but cannot finance social services and massive transit/transportation issues in the 21st century. Cities make up 80 per cent of our population and growing. Property taxes make up only 8 per cent of the total tax bill for a resident; the other 92 per cent consist of sales taxes and other taxes that are provincial and federal. The Problem – Part 2: Today's cities need more funding to meet huge growth pressures and services that historically were funded by provincial and federal governments — social housing and major transit/highway expansions. Around the globe, for decades, cities have received federal and provincial/state funding. The Fix: Cities currently get a small share of the federal gas tax to help pay for highways, roads and bridges. If we similarly got a thin slice of the HST for transit and housing, it would be a game-changer for cities. Toronto's share of 1 per cent of HST — $575 million a year — would take care of our social housing budget and half of the TTC's operating costs. That would allow investments in transit and road repair that would dramatically reduce congestion in Toronto. For social housing, it would dramatically hasten badly needed TCHC repairs and give us more flexibility to house our most vulnerable citizens. A huge weight would rise from cities' shoulders. The Alternative: The only other option is dedicated program funding transferred to cities from the federal and provincial governments for transit/transportation and housing. But, as we well know, program spending is subject to annual ups and downs. Cities need certainty and sustainability through a sharing of taxes collected within our cities, the economic engines of Canada. The Odds: The federal government is now in a surplus position and has more flexibility than the other levels of government to support allocation of these needed HST funds across Canada.
Federal election party leaders, from top left, Stephen Harper, Elizabeth May, Justin Trudeau and Thomas Mulcair.
- WHAT THE PARTIES SAY Liberals: No commitment to giving cities a share of the HST. Promises include $60 billion over 10 years to provinces, territories and municipalities for public transit, social and green infrastructure. Conservatives: No commitment to giving cities a share of the HST. Promising up to $2.6 billion as Ottawa's one-third share of Mayor John Tory's proposed SmartTrack commuter rail plan. Ontario municipalities to get $11 billion for infrastructure over 10 years, until 2024, from the New Building Canada Fund. NDP: No commitment to giving cities a share of the HST. Promises include giving cities an extra cent of the federal gas tax — $420 million a year more, divided among municipalities. Also, $12.9 billion over two decades for Toronto region infrastructure, including $7.7 billion that would be targeted exclusively to transit projects. Greens: Are committed to providing one point of the GST/HST — $6.4 billion — in long-term funding to municipalities for infrastructure, “creating good local jobs, and building vibrant, safe, and livable Canadian towns and cities.” Christopher Hume can be reached at chume@thestar.ca .
While some motorcycles are more capable than others, there are very few bad ones on the market today. Modern machines might not be as stylish as old timers, but they go, turn and stop better.
That's why engine, suspension and brake upgrades are common on classic custom builds. But if you're working with a brand-new bike—and your budget and time are both limited—isn't it better to focus your energies elsewhere?
That's the call Austria-based NCT Motorcycles had to make with this 2016 Harley-Davidson Street 750. A Harley-Davidson dealer handed the bike over, with a mandate to rework it into a raffle prize for the upcoming 20th annual European Bike Week.
NCT has no trouble going to town on a build. But with a set budget—and their Feldkirchen workshop already overflowing—they had to do things a little differently.
“When you have only a little budget, you have to concentrate on one thing,” the guys tell us. “So what do you want—a new look, or new tech? We decided to put the money into a new design and not in technical parts, because they are still fine.”
So while NCT have left the Harley's wheels, suspension and brakes alone, all of its bodywork's gone straight into the bin. In its place are a hand-made tank, tail section, front fender and side covers, all designed to give the Street a radically different visual vibe.
The tank turned out to be the hardest piece to fabricate, but it's paid off. The new unit is a lot slimmer than stock, and provides a solid cornerstone for the rest of the revamp. “It took so many hours to achieve a good looking and clean result,” says the team, “but it is also the part we like most about this bike!”
A fair amount of fettling went down at the back too. NCT cut and looped the frame, touching up the paint along the way (rather than stripping the bike right down for a full frame powder coat). The new seat cowl includes a tidy LED taillight, with upholstery done in cow leather.
The stock headlight's been left up front, but it's no longer wrapped up in the OEM headlight shroud. Kellerman supplied new turn signals: two are mounted behind the rear shock mounts, and the other two are bar-end numbers. The original handlebars have also made way for a more aggressive bend from LSL.
With everything nipped and tucked, the Street's hefty exhaust system looked way out of place—so NCT trimmed the stock muffler for a more compact effect. As a final touch, they nudged the forks down a bit to tweak the angle of attack.
Although the Street 750 was a bid for Harley-Davidson to reach a wider audience, we've always felt that it didn't quite shake off its cruiser DNA. But by just changing the bodywork, NCT have transformed it into a sharp street tracker-cum-cafe racer.
And complementing the new lines is an equally slick paint job—an eye-catching coat of brilliant turquoise. “We know the color is not to everybody's taste,” the guys tell us. “But these days, with more and more good bikes driving around, you have to catch someone's eye with a freaking color scheme and design!”
NCT are also well aware that there's room for more work. But for now, they're just waiting to see who the new owner will be. “Maybe the fortunate owner will come back to our workshop with the bike to get the rest done,” they say.
Round two, anyone?

Google and the UK government are facing a barrage of complaints over the tech giant's recent £130m ($185 million) settlement with British tax authorities. Critics say the deal is too easy on Google and undermines international efforts to extract greater taxes from corporations. The European commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, said this morning that the EU is willing to investigate the settlement, telling BBC Radio 4 that these sorts of "sweetheart deals" can amount to "illegal state aid," and that they benefit established companies at the expense of newer businesses.
"If we find that there is something to be concerned about, if someone writes to us and says, well, this is maybe not as it should be, then we will take a look," said Vestager. Shortly after this, the deputy leader of the Scottish National Party, Stewart Hosie, said he'd written a letter asking for exactly such an investigation. Hosie said in a statement: "Working people and small and medium businesses do not have the luxury of negotiating down the amount of tax they have to pay — and we must now have independent verification that Google has not been extended that luxury." This morning, an EU official confirmed to Reuters that the Commission will "look at [the letter] and issues raised."
"Why is there one rule for big multinational companies and another for [everyone else]?"
The UK's leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, told the House of Commons yesterday that Google's deal equated to a tax rate of roughly 3 percent — compared to the UK's standard corporate tax rate of 20 percent. "Why is there one rule for big multinational companies and another for ordinary, small businesses and self-employed workers?" said Corbyn. The Verge noted earlier this week that, using 2013 as an example, Google earned close to £760 million in UK profits that year but paid only £20.4 million in tax — far less than the £152 million that would be expected under a 20 percent rate.
Pressure to extract fair taxes from international corporations continues to build, with the OECD this week agreeing on new rules to share tax information making it harder for companies to disguise profits. This morning, Italian tax authorities reportedly claimed that Google owes €227.5 million euros ($248 million) in back taxes, and Apple is also facing challenges over its financial arrangements, with analysts suggesting that the EU's ongoing probe into the company's back taxes could see the firm liable for several billion dollars in repayments. Apple CEO Tim Cook travelled to Brussels last week to lobby the EU personally, with a decision in the investigation expected in late February.
Updated January 28th, 06:33AM ET: Updated to include demands from Italian authorities for Google back taxes.
Updated January 28th, 07:00 AM ET: Updated to include confirmation from EU about a possible investigation.

Plenty of attention has been paid to the political disagreements between highly religious and less religious Americans, including on social issues such as same-sex marriage and abortion. But there has been less talk about how these groups differ – when they do – in how they live their everyday lives.
Pew Research Center set out to explore this topic from a number of different angles in a new report that is part of our U.S. Religious Landscape Study. Here are three areas where the highly religious – defined in this study as the 30% of U.S. adults who say they pray daily and attend religious services at least once a week – are different from the remaining 70% of the population, and three areas where they are not:
Ways in which the highly religious and less religious are different:
On average, Americans who say they attend religious services weekly and pray daily also report being happier than those who are less religiously committed. Four-in-ten highly religious adults say they are generally “very happy,” compared with 29% of those who are less religious. Those who are not highly religious are somewhat more likely than the most devout to say they are “pretty happy” (54% vs. 46%) or “not too happy” (14% vs. 12%).

Those who are not highly religious are somewhat more likely than the most devout to say they are “pretty happy” (54% vs. 46%) or “not too happy” (14% vs. 12%). Highly religious Americans see their extended families more often . Nearly half (47%) say they do this at least once or twice a month, while only 30% of less religious adults get together with extended family as often. Americans who are not highly religious are twice as likely as those who are highly religious to say they seldom or never attend gatherings with extended family (31% vs. 16%).
. Nearly half (47%) say they do this at least once or twice a month, while only 30% of less religious adults get together with extended family as often. Americans who are not highly religious are twice as likely as those who are highly religious to say they seldom or never attend gatherings with extended family (31% vs. 16%). Volunteerism and donations to the poor are especially common practices for those who are highly religious. Among people who pray daily and attend services weekly, 45% also say they volunteered in the past week (including 23% who did so mainly through a church or other religious organization). Just 28% of Americans who are not highly religious say they volunteered in the past seven days. The gap is even bigger when it comes to helping the poor: 65% of the highly religious say they donated money, time or goods to help the poor in the past week, compared with 41% of all other U.S. adults.
Ways in which the highly religious and less religious are not different:
Being religiously devout does not make it any more likely that a person will keep one's cool in stressful situations . Similar shares of those who are highly religious (41%) and not highly religious (43%) say they lost their temper in the past week. The shares of Christians (43%) and religious “nones” (42%) who say they lost their temper are virtually identical.

While some research has found connections between religiosity and health in certain areas, our new report shows that highly religious people are not very different from those who are less religious in overall satisfaction with the state of their health or in their frequency of exercising and overeating . Roughly the same portions of highly religious people (44%) and people who are not highly religious (43%) say they exercised three or more times in the past week, while similar shares also say they did not exercise at all in the past week (31% and 28%, respectively). And 58% of both those who are highly religious and less religious say they overate in the past seven days.

While some religious leaders emphasize care for the environment as part of their religious teaching – including Pope Francis in an encyclical he released last year – there are no differences between the highly religious and others when it comes to recycling habits. Nearly half of those in each group say they recycle “whenever possible,” while only 4% in both groups say they “never” recycle. Similarly, about a quarter of those who are highly religious and those who are not say they take a company's record of environmental responsibility into account as a major factor when making purchasing decisions.

Files revealed during high court action show some employees were labelled ‘troublesome' by union staff and were denied work by companies
Britain's biggest trade union, Unite, is facing calls to set up an inquiry into claims that union officials gave information to a clandestine blacklisting operation funded by major firms and enabling them to deny jobs to certain workers.
Details of the alleged complicity have emerged in documents prepared for a high court action following which construction firms apologised and paid compensation totalling around £75m to 771 blacklisted workers.
Blacklisted workers win £10m payout from construction firms Read more
Previously confidential documents from the secretive operation suggest that union officials privately warned managers of large companies not to employ specific workers because they were deemed to be politically troublesome.
According to signed statements by managers involved in running the blacklist, trade union officials helped to get some of their own members excluded from jobs as they wanted to prevent disruption on industrial sites.
Files from the blacklist show that trade union officials described individual workers as “militant”, a “troublemaker”, or with a warning to be “careful”.
Evidence of the apparent collusion between trade union officials and managers has led a group of 41 blacklisted workers to call on Unite to commission an independent inquiry into the claims.
They said officials working for Unite, and another union that has merged with Unite, have been implicated in what amounts to a “running sore” for the trade union movement. “We are not looking for a witch hunt, we simply want answers into possible union collusion in order to avoid repeating mistakes of the past,” they added.
The ballot for Unite's new general secretary closes on 19 April. Len McCluskey, the incumbent, said that if he was re-elected, he would “set up an independent union inquiry to investigate all evidence made available” to him about any officer collusion. “I will not allow any officer who has colluded in blacklisting to work for Unite,” he said.
Unite's acting general secretary, Gail Cartmail, said: “Only a full public inquiry with judicial authority will fully explain the depth to which the state and employers colluded to deny construction workers employment.”
“Unite has campaigned legally, industrially and politically to win justice for blacklisted workers and to ensure the disgusting practice of blacklisting is ended once and for all. Blacklisting is an industrial crime, the blame for which lays squarely at the door of the construction companies.”
On the blacklist: how did the UK's top building firms get secret information on their workers? Read more
More than 40 construction firms unlawfully compiled confidential files on the political and employment activities of more than 3,200 workers, some of them dating back to the 1970s.
Many workers had suffered long periods of unemployment as a consequence of being labelled troublemakers by the firms.
Daniel O'Sullivan, who was once chairman of the secret agency that operated the blacklist, worked for more than 30 years until 2008 as a manager in the construction industry. He said that as part of his job, he had meetings with senior union officials. These included representatives from Unite and the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians (UCATT), which has merged with Unite.
O'Sullivan said his discussions “made clear to me that the union officials were also concerned to prevent unnecessary disruption on site. Occasionally, union officials would give me information concerning a particular individual”. He gave as an example a worker who was described on his file in 2005 as a “troublemaker” by a union official.
Another manager involved in running the blacklist was Dudley Barratt, who worked as the head of industrial relations at the Costain construction firm in the 1980s and 1990s. He said he was friendly with officials in a number of trade unions who appeared to be aware of the covert blacklist.
He added they “would occasionally tell me names of individuals who they thought should not be employed on sites, on the basis that there might be a risk of these individuals using the opportunity to cause trouble to undermine a project and the official trade union activities on that site.”
“Overall, I gained the impression that there was a quiet acceptance by certain construction trade unions of the [blacklist] and the ‘benefits' of the checking service as such individuals could be disruptive of organised labour and the unions saw the benefit of having an organised site.”
Man behind illegal blacklist snooped on workers for 30 years Read more
Mick Anderson is one of the blacklisted electricians who received compensation after being unemployed for many months. His file noted that a firm was told in 2005 by the Amicus union that he was “not recommended”. Anderson was a member of Amicus which later merged with TGWU to form Unite. The file also records another warning from the union to another firm two days later, to be “careful” about him.
Entries in the file on bricklayer Brian Higgins, who has also received compensation for being blacklisted, identify union officials as the source of information about his union activities in 1992, 2002 and 2003. In one, an official states that Higgins “is connected” to a rank-and-file organisation of builders that campaigned for better conditions.
The blacklisted workers want an inquiry by a legal expert to interview trade union officials and victims, and see if information was handed over deliberately.
In my previous post, I wrote about dropping and reseeding the DB of your Rails app. This is useful in development, but you might want to disable such tasks in production. Let's look at how we can do that.
First, let's define a rake task that simply raises an exception if you run it in production environment:
# lib/tasks/skip_prod.rake desc 'Raises exception if used in production' task skip_prod: [ :environment ] do raise 'You cannot run this in production' if Rails . env . production? end
The rake environment task loads the Rails environment and makes methods like Rails.env.production? available, so we added that as a dependency of our task. Now we can change the db:reseed task to run this before dropping the database.
# lib/tasks/db.rake namespace :db do desc 'Drop, create, migrate then seed the development database' task reseed: [ 'skip_prod' , 'db:drop' , 'db:migrate' , 'db:seed' ] end
This ensures that the task always fails in production. But what about the other tasks that are already defined by Rails that could cause similar damage, like db:drop or db:reset ? We could add the skip_prod dependency to these tasks.
# lib/tasks/db.rake [ 'db:drop' , 'db:reset' , 'db:seed' ]. each do | t | Rake :: Task [ t ]. enhance [ 'skip_prod' ] end
The #enhance method adds skip_prod to the very beginning of the dependencies. So the exception is raised before the database is dropped.
Even if you have made sure that your data won't get deleted by an accidental rake command, do make sure that you've set up regular backups of the database. You never know what else could mess up your data.

Evidence that the NSA Is Storing Voice Content, Not Just Metadata
Interesting speculation that the NSA is storing everyone's phone calls, and not just metadata. Definitely worth reading.
I expressed skepticism about this just a month ago. My assumption had always been that everyone's compressed voice calls is just too much data to move around and store. Now, I don't know.
There's a bit of a conspiracy-theory air to all of this speculation, but underestimating what the NSA will do is a mistake. General Alexander has told members of Congress that they can record the contents of phone calls. And they have the technical capability.
Earlier reports have indicated that the NSA has the ability to record nearly all domestic and international phone calls -- in case an analyst needed to access the recordings in the future. A Wired magazine article last year disclosed that the NSA has established "listening posts" that allow the agency to collect and sift through billions of phone calls through a massive new data center in Utah, "whether they originate within the country or overseas." That includes not just metadata, but also the contents of the communications. William Binney, a former NSA technical director who helped to modernize the agency's worldwide eavesdropping network, told the Daily Caller this week that the NSA records the phone calls of 500,000 to 1 million people who are on its so-called target list, and perhaps even more. "They look through these phone numbers and they target those and that's what they record," Binney said. Brewster Kahle, a computer engineer who founded the Internet Archive, has vast experience storing large amounts of data. He created a spreadsheet this week estimating that the cost to store all domestic phone calls a year in cloud storage for data-mining purposes would be about $27 million per year, not counting the cost of extra security for a top-secret program and security clearances for the people involved.
I believe that, to the extent that the NSA is analyzing and storing conversations, they're doing speech-to-text as close to the source as possible and working with that. Even if you have to store the audio for conversations in foreign languages, or for snippets of conversations the conversion software is unsure of, it's a lot fewer bits to move around and deal with.
And, by the way, I hate the term "metadata." What's wrong with "traffic analysis," which is what we've always called that sort of thing?

Could our massive universe be just one of many, like a bubble in a frothy stream of cosmos-spawning stuff? It sounds like something out of a 1970s British scifi novel, but it's become a popular explanation for the origin of our universe. But how can we test this hypothesis, when we're stuck in just one universe?
Image by Olena Shmahalo / Quanta Magazine
Physicists who were once wary of the multiverse hypothesis have started to come around to this radical new way of thinking. This is partly because it helps explain why our universe just happens to have the right physical ingredients to make life possible.

In a fascinating two-part article about the multiverse over at Quanta, Natalie Wolchover and Peter Byrne write:
Many physicists loathe the multiverse hypothesis, deeming it a cop-out of infinite proportions. But as attempts to paint our universe as an inevitable, self-contained structure falter, the multiverse camp is growing. The problem remains how to test the hypothesis. Proponents of the multiverse idea must show that, among the rare universes that support life, ours is statistically typical. The exact dose of vacuum energy, the precise mass of our underweight Higgs boson, and other anomalies must have high odds within the subset of habitable universes. If the properties of this universe still seem atypical even in the habitable subset, then the multiverse explanation fails. But infinity sabotages statistical analysis. In an eternally inflating multiverse, where any bubble that can form does so infinitely many times, how do you measure "typical"? Guth, a professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, resorts to freaks of nature to pose this "measure problem." "In a single universe, cows born with two heads are rarer than cows born with one head," he said. But in an infinitely branching multiverse, "there are an infinite number of one-headed cows and an infinite number of two-headed cows. What happens to the ratio?" For years, the inability to calculate ratios of infinite quantities has prevented the multiverse hypothesis from making testable predictions about the properties of this universe. For the hypothesis to mature into a full-fledged theory of physics, the two-headed-cow question demands an answer.

The New Zealand right-hander earned his rise on the back of his stunning series against Sri Lanka where he scored 396 runs at an average of 198.
Two fifties and a career-high unbeaten 242 took Williamson past the 3000-run mark in tests.

Williamson is the only Kiwi in the top with Ross Taylor slipping three spots to 13 and Brendon McCullum dropping a place to No 15 despite solid series efforts with the bat against Sri Lanka.
Sri Lankan star Kumar Sangakkara has reclaimed the No 1 batting ranking from South Africa's AB de Villiers on the back of his double century in Christchurch.
Black Caps left-arm pace star Trent Boult is similarly placed at No 6 on the test bowling rankings after taking 11 wickets in the four innings as New Zealand won both tests.
Fellow opening bowler Tim Southee is at No 10 and Neil Wagner the next best New Zealander at 22 in a list headed by South African star Dale Steyn.
New Zealand's team success has also been rewarded with the Black Caps now placed at No 5 among the 10 teams in the top tier.
The series win over Sri Lanka, coupled with Australia having toppled India across the Tasman, saw New Zealand get a significant lift.
The ranking is further reward for a fine spell over the past 12 months.
New Zealand had slipped to No 8, below the West Indies, and ahead of just Bangladesh and Zimbabwe on the rankings.
But six straight series either won or drawn, home and away, has seen New Zealand as the big improvers on the rankings.
The Black Caps have edged past India and Sri Lanka and have Pakistan and England within their grasp as they eye another busy year.
Latest test team rankings:
1 South Africa (124 rating)
2 Australia 118
3 England 104
4 Pakistan 103
5 New Zealand 99
6 Sri Lanka 96

Buffalo, NY (WGR 550) - The Sabres Prospects Tournament returns to HarborCenter tonight with the Sabres hosting the Devils.
Buffalo's lineup will feature players like Alex Nylander, Justin Bailey, Nick Baptiste and Brendan Guhle.
Guhle has been back in Buffalo for a couple of weeks after training at home in Western Canada. The young defenseman will be playing for Chris Taylor and the Amerks staff as Phil Housley and his staff will watch. Guhle hopes to be able to interact more with the Sabres new head coach, “That will come more as the season goes on wherever I end up and I'm sure I'll get hopefully lots of interaction with him.”
This tournament is going to be a great chance for Guhle to show Housley that he belongs with the big club. Guhle said, “I think if I'm ready, they'll keep me. I think if I show them I deserve it, then I'll be given an opportunity, but if I come in and I don't perform as well as I'd like to, I would then probably start off in Rochester and there's nothing wrong with that.”
“It would be good for my development, hopefully I'd get to play a lot of minutes. They're going to do what's best for me.”
New Jersey brings in the first overall pick in the 2017 NHL Draft, Nico Hischier. Newly signed college free agent Will Butcher will play, as will 2014 1st round pick John Quenneville. The winger played 12 games in the NHL with the Devils last season scoring one goal and three assists. He added 14 goals and 46 points in 58 games with AHL Albany.
Sabres' 2014 3rd round pick Jonas Johansson gets the call in goal. With Linus Ullmark the number one guy in Rochester, Johansson will likely be the number one goalie in Cincinnati this season.
Join Me, Brian Duff and Pat Malacaro for all the play-by-play action beginning at 7:00 on WGR Sports Radio 550 and the live stream at sabres.com.

President Obama decided Friday not to raise federal ozone standards for air pollution, causing a rift with environmentalists but winning praise from industry groups and congressional Republicans.
In his decision, relayed to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson, Obama cited the need to remove uncertainty for businesses that would be affected.
"I have continued to underscore the importance of reducing regulatory burdens and regulatory uncertainty, particularly as our economy continues to recover," Obama said. "Ultimately, I did not support asking state and local governments to begin implementing a new standard that will soon be reconsidered."
The move was immediately heralded by Republican leaders as more important to the nation's business climate than Obama's speech on jobs to a joint session of Congress next Thursday.
"This action alone will prevent more job losses than any speech the president has given," said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. "I hope he will listen to the bipartisan calls from across the country to address his administration's negative impact on job creation."
Complying with the new regulation could have cost industry from $20 billion to $90 billion annually, making it the most expensive new rule on the federal books. It topped the list of proposed regulations that could cost more than $1 billion demanded recently by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.
"We're glad that the White House responded to the speaker's letter and recognized the job-killing impact of this particular regulation," said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel. "But it is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to stopping Washington Democrats' agenda of tax hikes, more government 'stimulus' spending, and increased regulations, which are all making it harder to create more American jobs."
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, congressional Republicans and others had complained that raising ozone standards for air pollution would cost billions of dollars and result in lost jobs. A study last year by the Manufacturing Alliance predicted as many as 7.3 million jobs could be lost by 2020.
The issue of excessive federal regulations is gaining steam in Washington. Obama has ordered agencies to roll back old, redundant rules that are no longer needed. House Republicans are putting together a fall agenda focused on easing the regulatory burden on business.
When Congress passed the Clean Air Act in 1970, it required the EPA to review the allowable pollutant levels every five years. A new ozone standard was announced in 2008 by the Bush administration.
However, because it was set at 75 parts per billion, and the EPA's outside panel of scientists had recommended a range between 60 and 70 parts per billion, clean air advocacy groups went to court to get it changed. Jackson said the 2008 level was not "legally defensible."
The administration already had missed several deadlines to change the standard for smog from the 2008 level.
More than 175 business organizations sent a letter to Obama last month asking that the pending standard be delayed at least until 2013.
"The president's decision is good news for the economy and Americans looking for work," said Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute. "EPA's proposal would have prevented the very job creation that President Obama has identified as his top priority."
Ross Eisenberg of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the decision points to possible compromise between the White House and Republicans on a regulatory agenda.
"We're hoping that this will springboard into real, serious regulatory reform legislation," he said.
White House officials said the decision had nothing to do with industry pressure or politics. But it came in the wake of another bad monthly jobs report that showed no jobs added in August on a net basis.
It was relayed to the EPA by Cass Sunstein, administration of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. He wrote that Obama "has made it clear that he does not support" raising the ozone standards now.
"Finalizing a new standard now is not mandatory and could produce needless uncertainty," Sunstein wrote, noting that current ozone standards must be reviewed in 2013 anyway.
At the same time, administration officials took pains to defend their environmental record. Heather Zichal, deputy assistant to the president for energy and climate change, posted on the White House blog a list of achievements, such as new fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks and the first national standard to reduce mercury from power plants.
"Over the last two and a half years, the Obama administration has taken unprecedented steps forward to protect the public health of American families by reducing harmful air pollution," Zichal wrote. "Taken together, the administration's clean air achievements will produce enormous benefits for public health and the environment, while promoting the nation's continued economic growth and well-being. "
Jackson defended her agency's actions on air pollution and said the ozone standard still will get reviewed in the future.
"Since Day One under President Obama's leadership, EPA has worked to ensure health protections for the American people, and has made tremendous progress to ensure that Clean Air Act standards protect all Americans by reducing our exposures to harmful air pollution like mercury, arsenic and carbon dioxide," Jackson said.
"This administration has put in place some of the most important standards and safeguards for clean air in U.S. history: the most significant reduction of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide air pollution across state borders; a long-overdue proposal to finally cut mercury pollution from power plants; and the first-ever carbon pollution standards for cars and trucks."
Nevertheless, environmental groups usually allied with the White House quickly blasted Obama's decision.
"The Obama administration is caving to big polluters at the expense of protecting the air we breathe," said Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters. "This is a huge win for corporate polluters and huge loss for public health."
Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said Obama was "putting the interest of coal and oil polluters first."
" Half of U.S. families live in places where it is literally unsafe to breathe the air," he said. "Kicking the inhaler down the road will do nothing to protect our children."
Friends of the Earth managing director David Hirsch accused the president of "taking his cues from (House Majority Leader) Eric Cantor."
"President Obama decided today to trash fundamental protections for Americans' health," Hirsch said. "His decision will mean more children suffering from asthma and more permanent lung damage for adults."
"Slow-walking is no way to govern when it comes to protecting the health of all Americans, especially children and the elderly, the most vulnerable among us," said Frances Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. "Our public officials, including those in the White House, are there to protect us from harm. They need to get on with doing their jobs."
The environmental law group Earthjustice had sued to challenge the standards on behalf of five other organizations, but it was put on hold while the administration considered raising them. The American Lung Association said Friday it will look to revive the lawsuit.
"The Obama administration knows the heavy cost of smog pollution but has made the terrible decision to leave outdated, weak standards in place, leaving thousands of Americans who suffer from lung and breathing problems at the mercy of this dirty air," said Martin Hayden of Earthjustice.
"Sacrificing American lives and forcing our friends and family members who suffer from asthma to breathe dirty air is a poor legacy for President Obama. Keeping weak, inefficient standards in place is not the change we were promised."
But Republicans in Congress heralded it as the right medicine for an ailing economy.
"Job creators scored a major victory today in the fight against Washington's red tape," said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., leader of Senate Republicans' effort on regulations. "After months of discussions, the White House finally admitted that its ozone rule was completely unnecessary and bad for our economy."
The leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee said the move should be followed by others.
"It is clear that our economy could not sustain the burden created by this completely discretionary proposal," said committee chairman Fred Upton and energy and power subcommittee chairman Ed Whitfield in a statement. "We encourage the president to follow today's action with similar steps to prevent EPA from shipping our jobs overseas."
Others, however, have argued that tougher ozone standards would save money currently lost when Americans get sick from air pollution.
"Those rules will generate billions of economic benefits in excess of compliance costs," said Michael Livermore, executive director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University School of Law. "With each year of delay, that means additional costs imposed on the public, included lost productivity, hospital bills, more asthma cases and untimely deaths."
Here's the president's statement:
Over the last two and half years, my administration, under the leadership of EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, has taken some of the strongest actions since the enactment of the Clean Air Act four decades ago to protect our environment and the health of our families from air pollution. From reducing mercury and other toxic air pollution from outdated power plants to doubling the fuel efficiency of our cars and trucks, the historic steps we've taken will save tens of thousands of lives each year, remove over a billion tons of pollution from our air, and produce hundreds of billions of dollars in benefits for the American people. At the same time, I have continued to underscore the importance of reducing regulatory burdens and regulatory uncertainty, particularly as our economy continues to recover. With that in mind, and after careful consideration, I have requested that Administrator Jackson withdraw the draft Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards at this time. Work is already underway to update a 2006 review of the science that will result in the reconsideration of the ozone standard in 2013. Ultimately, I did not support asking state and local governments to begin implementing a new standard that will soon be reconsidered. I want to be clear: my commitment and the commitment of my administration to protecting public health and the environment is unwavering. I will continue to stand with the hardworking men and women at the EPA as they strive every day to hold polluters accountable and protect our families from harmful pollution. And my administration will continue to vigorously oppose efforts to weaken EPA's authority under the Clean Air Act or dismantle the progress we have made.

So, this happened, ICYMI: This morning Matt Lauer and Al Roker got prostate exams on Today to promote getting prostate exams in real-life — and they did it while the cameras were rolling live, because honestly, I don't think the Today show knows what to do with all of the airtime NBC has given them. How many hours is their show up to now, like 10? Save them from themselves before they just start staring at the cameras helplessly while Kathy Lee and Hoda chug wine bottle after wine bottle in the background. This is how anarchy begins.
Anyway, Lauer and Roker's prostate exams: You'll all be glad to know they went well! As the segment begins, Savannah Guthrie informs us all that they'll be doing this thing "in a tasteful way...this is not The Learning Channel" — a.k.a., nothing like the time Kathie Couric got a colonoscopy on live television. Lauer and Roker actually go into a room with Lenox Hill urologist Dr. David Samadi separately, and the examination is conducted behind closed doors while Guthrie discusses men's health to pass the time.
I get the whole idea behind this segment — they wanted to promote men's health for the month of November, and what better way to remind people to get a prostate exam than to shove it in their face before they've even had their morning coffee? Short of showing Lauer and Roker actually getting their exams, there's no better way. Unfortunately, the entire thing just comes off as awkward and forced instead of educational, so...mission only partially accomplished. Sorry, Today:
You can check out the clip from the segment below.
A Saudi prince was detained at the Beirut International Airport in Lebanon's largest drug bust in history, a security source told Sputnik.
Prince Abdel Mohsen Bin Walid Bin Abdulaziz and four of his friends were detained by airport security on Monday, while trying to smuggle about two tons of Captagon pills and some cocaine.
The four other men are also Saudi citizens, identified as Bandar Bin Saleh al-Shirali, Yaahia Bin Shaim Bin Shumari, Ziyad Bin Samir al-Hakim and Mubarak Bin Ali al-Kharisi.
Captagon is the brand name for the amphetamine phenelhylline, a synthetic stimulant known for psychoactive and stimulant effects. The drug is fairly popular in the Middle East.
"The smuggling operation is the largest one that has been foiled through the Beirut International Airport," AFP cited an anonymous Lebanese security source.
When detained, the five Saudis had the drugs neatly packed into cases, which were waiting to be put onto a private plane headed to Saudi Arabia, according to information given to Sputnik.
It will be interesting to see what will happen to the prince now. It's a well-known fact that Saudi Arabia has very strict rules when it comes to the possession of drugs. Under the Gulf Kingdom's interpretation of Sharia law, this type of crime is punishable by death through beheading with a sword.
The Kingdom has already beheaded more than 130 people this year for the crimes such as the possession of drugs, drug trafficking, murder, armed robbery, rape and apostasy.
Members of the Saudi royal family have had problems with the authorities of other countries in the past.
Last month, another Saudi prince was arrested in Los Angeles accused of taking cocaine, sexually assaulting a maid, threatening to kill women who refused his sexual advances and having sex with his male aide.
Back in 2013, a Saudi princess enslaved a woman from Kenya making her a housemaid, but criminal charges against the princess were eventually dropped.
Why Is The Bench So Underutilized in CS:GO?
Mike "Ragamuffin" Ciavarella April 19th 2017 9:52 PM
The answers might not surprise you, but it's time for players and organizations alike to stop being myopic and to start seeing the bigger picture.
I like to use comparisons to professional sports in my articles because I think the natural progression of ESports is to become more similar to professional sports, in time. This article is no exception.
Basketball is similar to Counter-Strike in many aspects. Both games are played with only 5 active players per team. The positions match up nicely – point guards are basically in-game leaders, there are 2 forwards or entry-fraggers that take the main shots, and AWPers can anchor the defense in the same way centers do. Each game even has a coach that can call timeouts and outline plays to run. But there is one key element of basketball that Counter-Strike is sorely lacking, and that is substitutions. When a star player is having an off day, innumerable basketball games have been turned around by young, energetic players or veteran role players coming off the bench to support the rest of the team. The NBA even has a prestigious honor, the Sixth Man of the Year Award, for the best player primarily used as a substitute during a season.
CS:GO, on the other hand, has always had teams of only 5 players at its highest levels. Very few teams have a bench player, and in those cases, it is a benched player – in other words, someone playing very poorly but who still happens to be under contract with his organization. In this scenario, the player is relegated to the bench and not included in team activities until his contract expires or another team buys it out. There are a few reasons why this happens. The first is that it obviously costs more money for an organization to have a bench. To have even one extra person on the team means an additional salary to pay, room and board to provide, and travel to accommodate. With more and more large companies and sports franchises investing into ESports as a good financial decision, there may be a greater focus on the bottom-line, which means non-essential assets to a team may be cut out even more. Another issue with a bench is the fact that majors currently only allow 6 players to be registered per team – 5 main players and a coach/reserve player. Any team, when forced to choose, would rather have a not-so-skilled coach than a role-playing 6th man (and rightfully so, in my opinion), so the options and versatility of a bench are limited.
Even working within the current rules' limitations, however, there are still many unutilized applications for this bench player/coach. Similar to what happens in other sports, the reserve player should be willing and able to play when a main player is having an off day or is sick or otherwise unable to play. Often times a new 5th will give different strengths to a team, make strategies more unpredictable, and help confuse the opponents who prepared for a different player. Some might note that this has been done before, notably on Team3D back when ShaGuar and KSharp would share AWPing duties and Dominator would sometimes come out as the 6th man. Also note that this does not involve much more preparation on the coach's part. Most coaches were at one point professional players themselves, so it is not a stretch for them to play a map every now and then. Even mastering just one map can make a huge difference in a team's map-picking metagame. This scenario has already paid dividends for one team: when THREAT had to take pyth's place at the MLG Major, NiP arguably advanced further in the tournament than experts predicted them to 1.
THREAT has already shown what an impact a coach can have in-game
Coaches should not only be prepared to go in, but also not be reluctant to sub out an underperforming player in the middle of a group stage, for the reasons outlined above. However, a problem does arise when you have the coach intentionally removing a player from a lineup to put himself in – it creates a power dynamic that the now-benched player may not take too kindly to. This is why I'm proposing the following rule changes:
Allow teams to have a designated coach as well as 1 benched player. In addition to allowing substitutions between maps, also allow substitutions during a map. Players can be swapped at halftime or during a timeout taken by the team. The player coming in takes the money and inventory of the player subbing out. Some kind of restriction or penalty on subbing, such as only 1 sub per half, a set number of rounds between subs, or a money penalty for subbing more than once each half. This would have to be experimented with, and ultimately may not be necessary.
Allowing substitutions mid-map would give even greater strength and flexibility to a team's strategies. This player can practice very specific actions within strat executions that will help his team gain an advantage. For example, if all a reserve player practices is getting entry frags in one or a few certain bombsites, thereby giving his team a higher chance of planting the bomb when attacking those sites, he can dramatically impact the outcome of that map. We may even see the development of role players. Some examples include: players that are particularly good on pistol rounds, players very skilled at a certain map, and players that are exceptional on defense. This rule change would give greater value to players with these niche skills. Another great facet of substitutions is that younger players who are currently in the semi-pro zone can get exposed to professional Counter-Strike in small doses. We often see inexperienced players who get picked up by popular teams crash and burn in the big leagues. Often times, the jump in skill is just too high to adjust to in a short period of time. By giving these players with huge potential simple tasks in game (i.e. sub in for this strat, throw this nade, peek this corner, then sub out), they become acclimated to the difficulty level more gradually and are able to get some experience against other pros without immediately being labelled a failure after one bad tournament. This would sync up well with the academy systems that some teams already have – rotate academy players to shift up to the main team and help the organization in lesser leagues and tournaments.
We can also speculate as to what would happen if and when the bench grew in size (as organizations generated more capital and were able to pay for these additional players). At 2 or 3 reserve players, teams wouldn't have to choose between bringing up a young aimer and calling in a journeyman pistoleer. They could have both, with a slot to spare, greatly diversifying the composition of the team. At a bench 4 to 5 deep, teams' map pools start to increase. Now, not only can a team play all 7 maps, but Valve could conceivably increase the map list by 2 and still expect teams to have some degree of coverage on most, if not all of the maps. These rule changes would open the door to so much variety and exciting unpredictability in matches and so many possibilities for current pro outsiders – but in a world that has thus far been strictly defined as 5v5, we have to start small. Teams should encourage their coaches to train in key areas of improvement for the team and sub him in for a map to see if the tactic is successful. The validation and recognition of even a single player bench as a weapon could cause a huge paradigm shift in CS:GO as we know it.

Today there is one more healthy seal in the sea as Nellie the harp seal returns to the ocean after nearly seven weeks of rehab. This sassy little seal awkwardly flopped her way across 100 feet of sandy shore under the Ponquogue Bridge in the Hampton Bay just east of Long Island before drifting off into the deep where she will hopefully live a long and healthy life after some shaky beginnings.
Nellie, the one year old harp seal who was believed to come from the water up north by Canada was found on the beach by Coney Island on March 1st. When Nellie was discovered, she was malnourished, dehydrated and suffered from a respiratory infection as well as other wounds. At the time, Nellie was only around 55 pounds, well underweight for a one year old seal which should have weighed over 200 pounds. She was taken in by the local Riverhead Foundation for Marine Research and Preservation.
After being plucked from the New York City beach, Nellie was treated by veterinarians who gave her a full physical, treating lesions and running blood tests before they prescribed her antibiotics and pumping fluids and nutrients through a tube until she was able to digest solid food again. While many marine animals that are wounded and taken into recovery are never released, the Riverhead Foundation stood firm on their stance that Nellie belonged back in the sea and did everything they possibly could to make sure that happened. As Nellie recovered from malnutrition and respiratory infection, she was able to move onto solid food. She grew quickly after that. The harp seal that washed up weighed 55 pounds, but by the end of her treatment Nellie was up to standard size at 255 pounds.
Harp seals prefer to spend most of their time in the ocean water, only gathering on land in large colonies which is why finding a solitary harp seal at Coney Island was quite strange to the Riverhead Foundation. Another oddity is that the harp seal prefer the cooler waters of the Arctic and North Atlantic, so what brought Nellie to New York City is still up for speculation. However, with a crowd of 200 well-wishers, Nellie was released back in the ocean yesterday where marine biologist and the helpful veterinarians that treated her hope she will find her harp seal colony again.
Placing a peripheral IV under ultrasound guidance is often much more challenging than it outwardly appears, especially for novice users. One of the more difficult aspects is in making sure that the target vessel is perfectly in the middle of the screen and then guessing where that corresponds to the middle of the ultrasound probe.
Trick of the Trade:
Use the M-mode line to optimize needle-vein alignment
Some ultrasound machines have a special line that can be superimposed down the middle of screen, though this is often buried in complex settings and is generally directed towards biopsies and other needle-guided procedures. For example, on Zonare machines this is called the “Biopsy Guide”.
For a simpler solution, one can use the M-mode line on many machines. M-mode displays one line over time and is especially useful for certain applications in emergency medicine like assessing for a pneumothorax or measuring fetal heart rates.
However, most machines require the user to press the M-mode button twice to engage it. Generally, the first press puts the M-mode line on the screen and then the user can move the line if needed or press the button again to start classic M-mode.
Instead, I press the button once to bring up the M-mode line directly in the middle of screen when placing peripheral IVs. I know that this line corresponds to the middle of the ultrasound probe and then I line up my IV catheter with the mark on the probe—knowing that it will proceed along the path of the vertical M-mode line.

Bernie Sanders appeared on "The View" Friday morning, turning the set of the long-running ABC talk show into the latest battleground in the race to crown a Democratic nominee for president.
Democrats walking back respective campaign gaffes
Tensions flared this week between the Sanders camp and that of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, his rival for the nomination, when Sanders called Clinton "not qualified" to be president during a campaign event Wednesday.
Asked about his remarks today on "The View," Sanders struck a more conciliatory note, stating that Clinton is "obviously" qualified. Sanders had previously backtracked on his Wednesday comments in an interview with Charlie Rose aired on the "CBS Evening News" Thursday night.
Sanders also used his appearance on "The View" as a chance to lament the negative tone that has inflected the Democratic primary.
"I hope that stops. I think the people of this country understand we have some enormous crises and they want the candidates to deal with these crises and certainly they do not want to have us act like Republicans who are an embarrassment to this entire country in terms of how they are running their campaign," he said.
Clinton and Sanders step up attacks ahead of NY primary
But Sanders defended his Wednesday comments as "a response to attacks against me" and went on to suggest that Clinton, unlike himself, "regrets a lot" of her previous policy positions and votes in the Senate.
Sanders' statements echoed longstanding criticisms of Clinton's Senate voting record, most notably her vote authorizing the Bush administration to use military force in Iraq, a measure Sanders opposed. Sanders also highlighted Clinton's Iraq War vote in his Wednesday remarks as a reason why Clinton was "not qualified" to serve as president.
"What I thought I made clear is you call into question the judgment of someone who, I believe, voted for the war in Iraq, which turns out to be one of the more disastrous foreign policy blunders in our history," Sanders said.
When "The View" host Joy Behar asked if Clinton regrets that decision, Sanders agreed: "She regrets a lot of things. In saying that I don't mean to be sarcastic. We all make mistakes."
But, he said, "I regret less than she does because I had the courage to vote the right way even when it was not necessarily popular."
The Vermont senator's appearance on "The View" came just three days after Clinton did the same, during which she spoke approvingly of the tone of the Democratic race.
"I'm very proud of the campaign Senator Sanders and I have run because we've run it on issues compared to insults, we've really tried to stay on issues, where we stand and what we would do," Clinton said Tuesday on the talk show.
In addition to his comments on Clinton's record, Sanders did not definitively rule out the possibility that his campaign would seek a contested Democratic national convention in Philadelphia this summer if neither he nor Clinton receives the 2,383 delegates needed to win the nomination outright.
"I don't want to get into all of the details," Sanders said. "We hope to have majority as we go into Philadelphia for the convention. But I think what Democrats perhaps are also seeing, if you look at the polling out there, what the polls show is us as a much stronger candidate against Trump and the other Republicans."
Despite his criticisms of Clinton, Sanders' appearance was not without its lighter moments. The hosts subjected him to questions about his private life similar to those they directed at Clinton earlier this week, prompting Sanders to reveal his favorite fictional president (Jed Bartlet, portrayed by Martin Sheen in the NBC television series The West Wing) and name Behar, who was seated to the right of him, as his celebrity crush.
The hosts also gently ribbed Sanders for referring to subway tokens while campaigning in New York earlier this week. Though the Vermont senator is a native of Brooklyn, subway tokens have not been used as a means to enter the city's mass transit system since 2003.
They presented Sanders with a New York MetroCard and, after mocking a photo of Republican presidential candidate John Kasich eating pizza with a knife and fork during a campaign stop in New York last week, offered him a pizza of his own.
"Are you all ready?" Sanders asked, holding up a slice. He ate it with his hands.
5 Year-Old Bullying VICTIM Forced to Sign ‘Sexual Misconduct' Confession (Video)
5 year old bullying victim forced to sign ‘sexual misconduct' confession
After being coerced by a fellow classmate into pulling his pants down at school, kindergartner Eric Lopez was forced to sign a “sexual misconduct” form by school officials. This happened despite the fact that Lopez was told that if he did not pull his pants down, another student would.
AZFamily reported:
This seemingly harmless action sparked an immediate response by Arizona school officials. Lopez was taken directly to the principal's office where he was made to sign a form incriminating himself for sexual misconduct on school grounds.
What Lopez didn't know, and was not told to him by school officials, was that he had a right to have his parents present. Eric's mother would not be informed of her sons' forced confession until it was too late to prevent or help it.
“I'm just heartbroken,” said Eric's mother in an interview with her son. “He's a 5-year old, he does not know right from wrong yet.”
According to Reason, Eric has been labeled as a “sexualized minor” and will have that label scar his transcripts and permanent records for the next 12 years of his life.
Lopez's mother is actively fighting this label, and has since filed “a bunch of paperwork” in hopes of repealing it.

Police from the eastern Chinese port city of Qingdao have arrested 14 people suspected of smuggling seafood with high radiation levels from waters near Fukushima, the Japanese prefecture affected by the 2011 nuclear disaster, reported state broadcaster CCTV.
The gang had smuggled 5,000 tons of seafood, including king crab and shrimp, worth $34.5 million, into China over the last two years.
Part of the seafood was sourced from Fukushima, one of the 12 Japanese prefectures banned from exporting marine products to China following the March 11, 2011 earthquake that triggered a tsunami and led to a nuclear catastrophe in the region.
The smugglers transported the goods from the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido to Vietnam, where they changed the labels to evade taxes as well as sanitary controls, the Qingdao police told CCTV.
Most of these products were sold in large Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
Chinese experts say food products with high levels of radiation can cause irreversible damage to human cells and even the DNA, according to local media reports.
They also warn radiation continues to negatively impact marine life in the vicinity of Fukushima, although five years have passed since the disaster.
Aaron Sandusky, the owner of the G3 Holistic medical marijuana enterprise in California's Inland Empire, has been found guilty of conspiracy to manufacture marijuana and intent to distribute. The jury is deadlocked on four other counts. He is in custody awaiting sentencing, which is scheduled for early January.
While Sandusky's plan of defense depended upon convincing jurors that he was in compliance with state law and that statements from federal officials led him to believe that the Feds wouldn't interefere, Federal Judge Percy Anderson cut off Sandusky's lawyer, Roger Diamond, at every turn.
The final day of the trial began with the bad news for the defense that Judge Anderson would not allow Diamond to make an "entrapment by estoppel" case, as outlined in an earlier post. Essentially, Diamond hoped to use public statements by President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, as well as private conversations between Sandusky and an FBI agent whom he assisted in prosecuting a corruption case, to prove that authorized government officials had given Sandusky erroneous advice leading him to reasonably believe that his actions were legal. Judge Anderson denied Diamond the opportunity to introduce any evidence or argumentation related to President Obama or Attorney General Holder.
"Unless it was a face-to-face meeting with President Obama or Eric Holder, it's not going to be admitted into evidence," Anderson said.
But the truly devastating blow to Diamond's case came when Anderson refused to allow any testimony related to Sandusky's conversations with the FBI agent. Diamond seemed to be in disbelief that the judge was making this last-minute ruling on the final day of the trial and asked for a trial postponement. The judge denied this request. At this point, Sandusky put his head in his hands and then glanced at his fiancee, who was by this time in tears. His look said it all: Game over.
Diamond was forced to change his defense strategy once again and focus on the government's key witness, John Leslie Nuckolls. Nuckolls is a longtime friend and associate of Sandusky's who helped him start G3 Holistic. He also turned out to be a government informant. Because of his close relationship with Sandusky, Nuckolls provided some of the more damning testimony in the trial. Diamond attempted to discredit Nuckolls who, the previous day, lied on the stand about the terms of his written agreement with the government. He also tried to make the case that Nuckolls had been setting up Sandusky from the very beginning.
In the end, the drama with Nuckolls seemed besides the point. The federal government was successful in quelling any discussion of medical marijuana laws, federalism, or jury nullification--all of which were specters looming over the case when they discussed it in open court while jurors were not present. In closing statements, the federal prosecutors were sure to emphasize to jurors that personal feelings, political beliefs, and morals do not matter. The law is the law.
One prosecutor instructed the jury "not to debate the law, but to apply the law." If there was one important takeaway from the prosecution's closing, it was this phrase, emblazoned on one of their presentational slides: "Factual determination, not moral judgment."
Diamond did not make any mention of state law and the legal ambiguities surrounding medical marijuana in his closing statement. Instead, he was constrained to pointing out technical faults in the prosecution's case. Was there really a formal agreement amounting to "conspiracy"? Had the prosecution really proved that Sandusky had handled the marijuana and therefore technically been in "possession" of it? But even while making these arguments, he conceded to the jury that he knows such technical loopholes rub people the wrong way and that it's simply his duty to make every argument possible for his client, even ludicrous-sounding ones. It was kind of like watching a stand-up comic finally give in to a relentess heckler, throw up his hands, and say, "I got nothing."
When the jury was dismissed, Judge Anderson did grant one request: The prosecution's request to add an extra two sentences to the written jury instructions: "Congress has defined marijuana as a schedule I controlled substance, making it illegal under federal law. You must disregard any state or local law to the contrary."
After the jury went into deliberation, I talked to Sandusky for a few minutes. As often seems to be the case, he seemed unusually cheerful given his circumstances. But he didn't seem to be in denial about what the likely verdict would be and seemed less-than-optimistic about Judge Anderson's sentence.
"I think he's going to throw the book at me," Sandusky said. "He can't wait to get his claws into me."
Sandusky also said, if convicted, he plans to file an immediate appeal based on the evidence that Judge Anderson denied.
So that's where we are with the drug war in California where, it bears repeating, medical marijuana is legal. Agents of the federal government are well aware that the tide of opinion has turned against marijuana prohibition, and prosecutors are reduced to devoting the majority of their closing statements not to convincing jurors that defendants are a danger to society but to admonishing jurors against daring to think about the moral justifications behind the law. Your job is not to consider right and wrong. Your job is to convict violators of the law. And that's exactly what they did today.
Sandusky faces a minimum ten years and the possibility of a life sentence.
UPDATE:
Aaron Sandusky's fiancée emailed to ask that I include a link to his legal defense fund to recoup attorney fees and plan for his appeal. It is here if you are interested.

Mix Diskerud will remain in Sweden on loan with IFK Goteborg.
U.S. international midfielder Mix Diskerud is in talks to have his loan to Swedish side IFK Goteborg extended through the end of 2017, a source with knowledge of the situation confirmed to ESPN FC.
Diskerud, 26, has been playing with Goteborg since March when he was loaned out by New York City FC, but the deal was due to expire on Aug. 27, hence the need for an extension. His original contract with NYCFC runs through the end of 2018.
FotbollTransfers.com reported that in an interview with the Football Channel, Diskerud said, "I'd love to stay. I like the guys and the club."
He added, "My people are talking to the club here and then on with the club over there. There are three parties. Hopefully, it will be resolved."
Just prior to the initial loan, NYCFC exercised a one-time buyout of Diskerud's contract. While New York has still been on the hook to pay most of Diskerud's wages, he has had no impact on the team's salary budget this season.
According to the MLS Players' Union, Diskerud made a base salary of $761,250 in 2016. A league source said in March that the loan would provide NYCFC with "minor salary relief only."
Diskerud has been able to rebuild his career to a degree in Sweden, after falling out of favor with NYCFC manager Patrick Viera. Diskerud has made 19 appearances in all competitions for Goteborg, scoring three goals. Goteborg are currently ninth in the Swedish top flight, 18 points behind first place Malmo.
NYCFC signed Diskerud just before the 2015 campaign and he made 27 appearances for the club under then-manager Jason Kreis, scoring three goals -- including the team's first-ever -- and adding one assist.
But following Kreis' firing at the conclusion of the 2015 season, and the subsequent hiring of Vieira, Diskerud fell down the NYCFC depth chart. He made just 12 league appearances in 2016, none after last June, scoring just once and adding two assists.
Diskerud's time in Sweden has yet to have any impact on his international prospects. The last of his 36 appearances came as a substitute on Oct. 13, 2015, in a 1-0 loss to Costa Rica.
In addition to his time with New York City FC, Diskerud has played with Norwegian sides Stabaek and Rosenborg, as well as Belgian side Gent.

Sinkhole swallows car in Newcastle as burst water main floods suburban roadway
Posted
A flood of water from a burst water main has opened up a large hole in a Newcastle suburban road.
The main burst in Albert Street, Wickham around 4:30am (AEST) on Thursday morning and a parked car slipped into the cavity.
The car's owner Simon West said he watched his vehicle sink into the hole over a couple of hours.
"I've had the worst luck. Three months ago I was rear-ended and now I've woken up and my car looks like it's gone down a sinkhole, so yeah, very bad luck," he said.
He said it would mean the day off work.
"I sent a message in saying there was a burst water main, but I was not believed until I sent a picture of my car sticking up out of the road," Mr West said.
Mr West said burst water mains were a common occurrence in the suburb, given the age of the area's undeground water pipes.
"It's pretty notorious for burst water main problems and issues like that," he said.
"I think it's about 80 years old, the plumbing in the area."
Hunter Water works to repair damage
Hunter Water executive manager, Jeremy Bath, said in total three cars were damaged by the burst main.
He admitted the underground pipes were prone to breakages.
"Wickham, being quite an old area, the pipes are of a decent age," Mr Bath said.
"That said, those pipes were checked in the not-too-distant past for breaks and there was nothing detected.
"Unfortunately, with breaks, you often can't determine the condition of a pipe until it breaks.
"We commit to inspecting every single centimetre of our 10,000 kilometres of water mains within the space of every five years.
"We have technology where people are able to listen, and they're what we call 'water whisperers' and they're able to walk along the street and hear if there's a break or a hairline fracture."
Around 40 properties in the street were without water for several hours while the main break was repaired.

Would that we had an articulate defender of freedom in Congress as Daniel Hannan, Minister of the European Parliament for South East England.
Here is a video of him confronting the Prime Minister of England.
The truth, Prime Minister, is that you have run out of our money. The country as a whole is now in negative equity. Every British child is born owing around £ 20,000. Servicing the interest on that debt is oing to cost more than educating the child.
Now once again today you tried to spread the blame around; you spoke about an international recession, an international crisis. Well, it is true that we are all sailing together into the squalls, but not every vessel in the convoy is in the same dilapitated condition. Other ships used the good years to caulk their hulls and to clear their rigging – in other words to pay off debt. But you used the good years to raise borrowing yet further. As a consequence, under your captaincy, our hull is pressed deep into the waterline under the accumulated weight of your debt.
… Now it's not that you're not apologizing. Like everyone else here, I've long accepted that you are pathologically incapable of accepting responsibility for these things. It's that you are carrying on willfully worsening our situation wantonly spending what little we have left. … Prime Minister, you cannot carry on forever squeezing the productive bit of the economy in order to fund the unprecedented engorgement of the unproductive bit. You cannot spend your way out of recession or borrow your way out of debt.
Watch the whole thing. Much of it applies to all the Democrat and Republican politicians in government today.

It was an educated guess. And it appears to have paid out.
I am told, spinning out of ECCC, that as part of Marvel's upcoming “Make Mine Marvel” relaunch in the autumn that, rather than relaunching with a load of new issue 1s, instead, we will get a load of new… legacy numbers.
All the old-school legacy characters will return with issue numbers that will add up all the issues published of that character's central series so far, including all the relaunches.
Of late, Marvel has normally done this just for promotional effect. They like to relaunch titles with a #1 fairly regularly to benefit from #1 sales bumps. This move may indicate a change in direction for the way future.
This includes a Bruce Banner-starring Incredible Hulk and a non-Hydra Captain America.
The first will be Venom which will keep going after its promotional #150 in May with #151 in June.
And Thor? Thor is due to be #700 in the autumn. I think.
If anyone wants to work out what issue number all of these books should be…. well, you'll do a better job than Marvel usually do when they try.

Bill Nye is perhaps best known for his role as “The Science Guy” in both kids TV programs and in popular media across various channels. Now, Nye is scheduled to take up a debate on climate change with none other than former Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin.
The event, which Variety reports will take place on May 2, will be hosted by Fathom Events and SpectiCast. This is to promote the film Climate Hustle, which is a documentary that denies climate change exists.
UPROXX reports that Palin has already committed her support to the film and will be participating in the event opposite Bill Nye. The two will square off on whether or not climate change is actually taking place due to mankind's influence on the environment.
Bill Nye will be firmly embedded within enemy territory at this debate with the likes of Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) also participating in the debate alongside the filmmaker Marc Morano. The debate is scheduled to be moderated by Brent Bozell.
It is pretty clear right from the onset that Palin denies the claims that scientists have made in regard to the effects that human beings are currently having on the environment, thus leading to climate change.
“I'm very passionate about this issue,” Sarah Palin told Variety. “We've been told by fearmongers that global warming is due to man's activities and this presents strong arguments against that in a very relatable way.”
But Bill Nye disagrees in a very passionate way. Nye has gone on many media shows and has laid out his claims in the most scientific ways he knows how. He has also taken to social media to make videos that lay out the argument in favor of climate change.
“People who do not believe in American exceptionalism have made this into a campaign issue, so it's vital that the other side be heard,” Palin told Variety. “I'm very pleased that this is written and spoken in layman's terms. My dad taught science to fifth and sixth graders, and it was very important to him that science be presented in an understandable way.”
Sound the Alarm: Sarah Palin and Bill Nye Will Appear On a Panel About Climate Change https://t.co/OisZugB0ha pic.twitter.com/y0GdowDK0P — Mediaite (@Mediaite) April 11, 2016
This is not the first time Bill Nye has squared off with the religious right. He also famously took on Ken Hamm in 2014 and challenged him on the religious book of creation, which he famously expounded upon the tale of Noah's Ark.
Hamm has also reportedly criticized Bill Nye for his stance on climate change in a blog post.
“Even on a live CNN television interview right after the debate between Bill Nye and me last year, I told him that I do not reject climate change,” Hamm wrote on his blog post. “But Bill refuses to acknowledge this because he wants people to believe creationists deny reality! The problem is that Nye denies that he is interpreting the evidence from a wrong foundation!”
Bill Nye will also have his hands full at this event when he squares off with Congressman Lamar Smith. Smith chairs the House Science Committee and has publicly accused the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of falsifying data for purposes of pushing the climate change agenda on behalf of scientists on the left, according to Raw Story.
Big Oil-backed group promotes Sarah Palin and Bill Nye as part of climate change panel https://t.co/0zHyfrXKC2 pic.twitter.com/MwcOSw9ev0 — Raw Story (@RawStory) April 11, 2016
There have also been some conflicting reports about this event. Raw Story says that Bill Nye has not actually been invited to the event, but rather his videos will be shown at the event. That will give Palin and Smith a chance to tee off on the planetary scientist without his presence to defend his claims.
Apparently, this event is set to take place on “invite only” basis and Bill Nye will not have an option to show up unless he has been invited to the debate.

Toronto's residential housing market showed no signs of cooling last month, with the average sale price soaring a record 33 per cent from a year ago, pushing the cost of a detached home in the heart of the city to almost $1.6 million.
In Toronto and surrounding suburbs prices climbed by a third in every major housing category, including townhouses and condominiums, as demand rose and listings failed to keep pace, according to figures from the Toronto Real Estate Board. The average home price in the metropolitan area rose to $916,567 from $688,011 a year earlier. Unit sales jumped 18 per cent to 12,077, the board said in a statement Wednesday.
“Annual rates of price growth continued to accelerate in March as growth in sales outstripped” listings, said Jason Mercer, head of market analysis at the real estate board. “A substantial period of months in which listings growth is greater than sales growth will be required to bring the GTA housing market back into balance.”
The soaring prices and limited supply are sparking debate among policymakers on how to ensure there is enough affordable housing while trying to avoid a market crash. Options under consideration by the city and province of Ontario include a new tax on foreign buyers or a tariff on vacant homes to curb speculation.
No Consensus
“I have a deep concern about the frustration that must be faced by young homebuyers trying to get in this market and just by people trying to move up in their housing,” Toronto Mayor John Tory told Bloomberg Television on Tuesday.
Tory said there's no consensus yet on “the nature of the forces that are pushing the prices up the way they are” and what is best to do about it.
Toronto Real Estate Board President Larry Cerqua said it's encouraging that government officials haven't introduced any “knee-jerk” housing policies.
“policymakers must remember that it is the interplay between the demand for and supply of listings that influences price growth,” Cerqua said in a statement.
The Toronto Real Estate Board is among opponents of the idea of implementing a foreign buyers tax to curb price gains. The group says the real problem is a dearth of housing inventory.
Bank of Nova Scotia's Canadian banking head James O'Sullivan said governments may have to intervene in the housing market if prices remain “overheated.”
Toronto's market is of prime concern because of unsustainable and unhealthy price increases, he told reporters Tuesday after Scotiabank's annual meeting. He'd like to see how home sales play out between April and June before pushing for further measures.
A foreign-buyers tax, such as the one British Columbia imposed last year to cool Vancouver's housing market, and a speculation levy should be “on the table,” he said.
Vancouver, formerly Canada's hottest housing market, saw benchmark home prices rise 13 per cent last month from a year ago, the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said on Tuesday. The average benchmark selling price of a single-family detached home in the Greater Vancouver Area rose 11 per cent to $1.49 million.

Just when Samsung thought the saga surrounding the combustible Galaxy Note7 might be over, news has come through that yet another phone has exploded, a totally different one this time.
The seemingly endless saga of the exploding Note7 resulted in not only a financial hit of a few billion dollars for Samsung, but the resulting attention it got online turned it into one of – if not the – the biggest tech PR disasters of the past few decades.
Just as things have appeared to have quietened downm since the company ordered a full recall and stoppage of production of the phone, there is news that its flagship phone, the Galaxy S7, is also caught up in the scandal.
According to CTV News in Canada, a man named Amarjit Mann was driving in his car when he suddenly felt his Galaxy S7 overheating in his pocket.
He took it out and it exploded in his hand, resulting in the entire car filling with smoke.
Mann needed to go to a hospital to receive treatment for severe burns on both his hands and wrist, which will put him out of work for up to four weeks as they heal.
“I should've lost my eyes, or my cheeks, or anything could have happened,” Mann said.
“I luckily threw it outside. It should have damaged my whole car. I just saw smoke and nothing else.”
Freak accident or sign of fault?
There has been no comment from Mann himself as to whether there could have been any reason why his phone alone might have exploded.
Despite the failure of the Note7, the Galaxy S7 had remained unscathed throughout the ordeal, remaining a favourite of critics and users.
However, as Samsung gears up towards an announcement and release of the Galaxy S8, the South Korean company will be hoping that this incident in Canada is just an oddity, rather than a potentially damaging fault.
Responding to news of the incident, a spokesperson for Samsung in Canada has said to CTV News that it will not comment on what could have caused the explosion without looking at the device first.
“Customer safety remains our highest priority and we remain committed to working with any customer who has experienced an issue with a Samsung product,” the Samsung spokesperson said.

Team 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 R H E CSU Bakersfield 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 6 2 South Carolina 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 X 5 5 1 Highlights MORE VIDEOS Coach Tanner M. Roth, J. Bradley Jr.
Columbia, S.C. - Jackie Bradley Jr. went 3-for-3 with a homer and three RBIs and starting pitcher Michael Roth improved to 4-0 on the year with eight innings of work tying a career-high with nine strikeouts as South Carolina defeated Cal State Bakersfield 5-1 in the first of a three-game college baseball series. Carolina is now 10-1 on the year while the loss drops CSU Bakersfield to 11-4 for the season.
Roth allowed just one unearned run in a season-high eight innings pitched and struck out nine while walking just one to pick up the victory. Roth also had nine strikeouts in a win over Southern Illinois on Feb. 25, 2011. John Taylor pitched a scoreless ninth inning with a pair of strikeouts to seal the Gamecock victory. CSU Bakersfield starter Mike McCarthy had a solid start despite the loss. He is now 1-2 on the year. He allowed four runs, two earned, on four hits with seven strikeouts and four walks.
Cal State Bakersfield got on the board with an unearned run in the top of the first inning. Leadoff hitter Andrew Letourneau opened the game reaching second base on a throwing error by Gamecock shortstop Peter Mooney. After a sacrifice bunt, he would score on Jeremy Rodriguez's RBI single up the middle off the glove of Roth.
Carolina answered back though in the bottom of the first. Adam Matthews connected with a one-out double to the gap in left-center and scored on Jackie Bradley Jr.'s RBI single up the middle. Bradley would eventually score with two outs as the Gamecocks caught a break as pop up off the bat of Brady Thomas was dropped by CSUB shortstop Tyler Shryock giving Carolina a 2-1 lead
It would remain that way until the bottom of the fifth when Bradley tallied his third hit of the game, a two-run homer to left-center to give Carolina a 4-1 advantage. CSUB looked to make a rally in the seventh inning with a runner on first and one out. DC Legg drilled a deep fly ball to left-center that looked to be an extra base hit but was caught by Bradley, who ran the ball down before running into the fence in left-center for the second out of the inning. After a single by Cael Brockmeyer gave CSUB a pair of base runners, Roth struck out pinch hitter Mick Gaston to keep the Gamecocks ahead by three runs.
Bradley's homer was his fourth of the season. Carolina added some insurance in the eighth inning as Brady Thomas tripled and scored on a passed ball by CSUB catcher Jeremy Rodridguez.
Bradley had three of the Gamecocks' five hits and also scored a pair of runs. Cal State Bakersfield finished with six hits on the afternoon with six different players tallying one hit apiece.
Game two of the series is scheduled for Saturday at 4 p.m. at Carolina Stadium. Live video broadcast is available at GamecocksOnline.com with the game also available on the Gamecock Radio Network.
GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- It's easily evident to those not inside the Florida locker room every day that Jeff Driskel has changed.
He's still focused and driven, but he comes across as much more confident and definitely more relaxed, which was obvious when he hammed it up with a significantly shorter member of the media just before doing a video shoot.
That's an indication that Driskel is much more at ease with who he is and more comfortable and confident in his knowledge and abilities as the Gators' starting quarterback.
Now the undisputed starter, Jeff Driskel has been a more relaxed presence at QB for the Gators this offseason. Melina Vastola/USA TODAY Sports
Driskel knows the offense completely now that he's in his second season under offensive coordinator Brent Pease. He knows where his receivers are supposed to be (even if they don't), knows his pre-snap reads and adjustments, and feels much more comfortable in the pocket. His fundamentals are better, too.
He should be a better player in 2013, someone capable of putting the team on his shoulders and winning a game instead of being a caretaker whose main directive was to not turn the ball over.
“It's his football team,” UF coach Will Muschamp said. “[Driskel] attacked the offseason the way you're supposed to as far as his mental preparation, watching film. He understands what we're doing offensively much better than a year ago, which is expected.”
The main reason for Driskel's improvement is that he's no longer fighting for the job. He's not competing with Jacoby Brissett, who left for N.C. State after the season ended, or worried that a couple of poor drives or games would get him benched.
The biggest benefit of that situation is that he's essentially getting twice as many practice reps, twice as much time in the film room, and twice as much individual work with Pease. He's taking all of the first-team snaps instead of sharing them. He's breaking down every play in the film room. He's explaining every protection and adjustment and getting nearly all of the feedback.
That showed during the spring, Muschamp said.
“When the game slows down a little bit, you get a little more mental quickness of where to take the ball down the field, first progression read to the second, and understanding where the pressure may come from,” Muschamp said. “That's part of the growing process of a young quarterback.”
Driskel said he's gaining a much better rapport with the receivers, which was something that he wasn't able to do last season because there was always some awkwardness between the quarterbacks and receivers because of the competition between Driskel and Brissett.
“When there's a competition, you know, some guys are going to -- not be on one side or the other -- but there's not the as close of a bond because no one wants to step on anyone's toes and no one wants to get on someone's bad side,” Driskel said. “When there's one set quarterback I think everyone responds well to it and everyone kind of is looking at the same person and getting on the same page with one person instead of doing it with two.”
Driskel still has a lot on which to improve, specifically mastering the pass protections and knowing which adjustments to make and when and getting rid of the ball quicker to avoid sacks.
But he appears to be on his way to becoming the kind of quarterback he was projected to be when he came out of Oviedo (Fla.) Hagerty High School in 2011 -- which should keep the Gators in contention for an Eastern Division title.
David Cameron has pledged to overrule the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and investigate allegations of civilian fatalities from UK air strikes in Iraq.
The Prime Minister said that he would look at the claims, first reported by The Sunday Herald, under questioning from SNP MP Angus MacNeil.
The MoD has previously refused to look into the accusations of up to 81 civilian casualties, from independent monitoring group Airwars, saying that it would only consider reports of deaths on the ground from UK military personnel or friendly “local forces”.
Mr MacNeil denounced that position as a "strange set of affairs".
Despite his pledge, Mr Cameron appeared to down play the potential veracity of the allegations.
He told MPs on the Liaison Committee that at the time the Commons debated extending airstrikes into Syria last month, "after all that action by the RAF... we did not believe that there had been any civilian casualties in Iraq".
But he added that he would "look at" the allegations of between 72 and 81 civilian deaths in Iraq linked to British military strikes.
Mr Cameron also pledged to consider relaxing restrictions to allow individuals to take Syrian refugees into their own homes.
High-profile figures including Nicola Sturgeon and former Labour leadership contender Yvette Cooper have offered shelter to those fleeing the civil war.
Meanwhile, an SNP MP called on the RAF's precision bombing skills to be used to drop food to Syrian civilians starving in besieged areas.
Patrick Grady, the SNP's international development spokesman, said that Scots had been "horrified" by the stories coming out of the town of Madaya in recent days.
Mr Cameron also hinted that he would look again at the rules on police bail in England after an Islamic State (IS) video suspect Abu Rumaysah was allowed to flee the country.
During an often heated session in front of MPs, in which he banged the table in front of him with his fist more than once, Mr Cameron also faced accusations that he was hampering the work of the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), by not allowing members to scrutinise military action.
The Prime Minister told MPs that the ISC had been given access to the intelligence seen by ministers.
But he added that it was "not the Intelligence and Defence Committee".
Afterwards Labour's Harriet Harman, the chair of parliament'Westminster's Joint Committee on Human Rights, said: “The PM sought to give the impression today that he is allowing the ISC to scrutinise the targeted killing of Reyaad Khan in Syria in August.
"But under questioning from the committee chairmanAndrew Tyrie he was forced to admit he is not allowing this scrutiny."
She added: "It's not acceptable that he is clearly frustrating the scrutiny work of the ISC, who he appointed and who are all security cleared.”
During the session, Mr Cameron also told MPs that tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia would mean that peace talks to bring the Syrian civil war to an end would be "incredibly difficult".
He also rejected suggestions that the West had to choose between the Syrian dictator President Bashar Assad and IS.
He said that Western powers had to look for a third way, as he accused Assad of using starvation as a "weapon of war".
US Secretary of State John Kerry hopes rebels will sit round a table with representatives of Assad's regime later this month in the hopes of agreeing a ceasefire.
The Prime Minister also confirmed that he intends to make a "comprehensive Gulf trip at some stage in the coming months".
A Commons vote midway through saw the 90-minute session cut to an hour and 13 minutes, for which the Conservative leader appeared to be grateful.
Earlier on his way in to be grilled by MPs he could clearly be heard saying that he was "not bad", adding: "I've got an hour and a half of this. I will be better after that."
There's no mistaking the new 2016 Chevrolet Camaro because, well, it has a strong resemblance to the departing car. Much like the Olsen twins, though, the two are similar but quite different. If you can discern Mary-Kate from Ashley at first glance, congratulations, you might peg the new Camaro quickly. Or maybe you've just watched too much TV.
But really, the big news about Generation 6 is that under the slightly smaller and sinewy silhouette, the Camaro now shares a platform with the Cadillac ATS, with 70 percent of the architectural components unique to Camaro.
Drawn like Jessica Rabbit, the Chevy's intense American muscle-car lines might cause import worshipers to dismiss it. Pity. It's bad in a good way — a rear-wheel-drive performance bargain.
General Motors is doing great things with chassis tuning, and the Camaro inherited the compelling goodness of the ATS that makes the car tons of fun to toss into a corner. Even without the available Brembo brakes, the car scrubs off speed securely.
Ayesha Takia's husband Farhan Azmi gets death threats
Bollywood actress Ayesha Takia's husband Farhan Azmi is receiving death threats from a political group over a phone call for marrying a Hindu girl. He filed a complaint with the Mumbai Police on July 26 regarding the phone calls. Farhan Azmi is a hotelier and the son of Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi. His father has several times made headlines for his controversial statements. According to Farhan Azmi, a political party is threatening him for being indulged in ‘Love Jihad' as he married a Hindu woman.
"You all are animals. Have you forgotten that you have indulged in Love Jihad by marrying a Hindu girl?", the unidentified caller said to Farhan Azmi according to SpotboyE report. Farhan has marred the Bollywood actress Ayesha Takia in 2009. The couple also has a son named Mikail.

"The aggressor, in no uncertain terms, extended death threats to the undersigned and his family...", states the report, a copy of which has been shared by SpotboyE.
The threat call was made on the behalf of Rajasthan Hindu Sena and was primarily targeting Farhan Azmi's father Abu Azmi. The political party took offence on Abu Azmi's comment about singer Suchita Krishnamoorthi's tweet about Azaan.
"Ask your father Abu Azmi to stop shouting like an animal else he will be bumped off. Also tell the son of Owaisi that he too will not be spared," Farhan Azmi was reportedly told, said Spotboye.

New medical technologies need bold researchers to make the leap from the laboratory table to hospitals and clinics, where they can improve or even save lives. Kelsey Moody, a 30-year-old scientist from Beekmantown, is one such researcher.
Kelsey is especially interested in the treatment of age-related diseases but is using a different approach. Currently, researching age-related diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, Parkinson's, and heart disease takes up huge amounts of funding; however, very few of these approaches aim to treat these pathologies at their root causes – the processes of aging – and this is why they are not successful.
His focus in the past few years has been developing an effective treatment for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss among people over 50.
The experimental treatment he's working on, called LYSOCLEAR, is currently being tested for validity at Ichor Therapeutics, a startup Moody founded in 2013 when he was only a second-year medical student with a $540,000 grant received from the Life Extension Foundation. LYSOCLEAR is based on the LysoSENS approach advocated for by the SENS Research Foundation, where Moody worked as an academic coordinator first in 2008-2010 and as a research scientist in 2012.
Both age-related and juvenile-onset macular degeneration are believed to be caused by the accumulation of waste products in the retina cells of patients. This accumulation leads to deterioration of the retina itself and eventually to vision loss. Ichor's treatment uses special enzymes to break down one of these waste products, which is called A2E. The hope is to prevent and maybe even reverse the disease.
Moody's company has received both public and private funds for over 3.2 million dollars, and his efforts have been praised by many experts, including Cornell Medical College ophthalmologist Szilard Kiss, Syracuse University professor Robert Doyle, and SENS Research Foundation Chief Science Officer Aubrey de Grey.
Now that LYSOCLEAR's first efficacy tests are complete, 15 additional million dollars will be needed to move to more thorough animal testing and finally to human clinical trials. If all goes well, this may happen within the next three years.
Kelsey is a long-time supporter of the SENS approach, an approach proposing to repair the damage that the aging processes do to help maintain health and delay age-related diseases. As he said to Fight Aging! during a recent interview, one of the main reasons he chose to focus on the treatment for age-related macular degeneration is that, in his opinion, it is the SENS therapy closest to clinical implementation.
If LYSOCLEAR turns out to be successful, it would go a long way towards further validating the whole paradigm. However, AMD is not the only focus of Ichor; the company also works on acute myeloid leukemia, a type of blood cancer with low survival chances.
In addition to his ongoing studies as a Ph.D. candidate in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology through the University of Miami, Moody received an MBA from Concordia University, Wisconsin in 2013 and completed two years of medical training at SUNY Upstate Medical University.
He was also Chief Technology Officer at ImmunePath, Inc. and is currently Adjunct Faculty at Onondaga Community College and a mentor for the 20 Under 20 program at the Thiel Foundation. Kelsey's next goal after a treatment for AMD is to go back to stem cell research, perhaps ushering new SENS treatments to the clinic.
How did you learn about the SENS approach?
I first came across SENS during an online review on regenerative medicine, and this initiated my interest in the study of human aging. At the time, I had no formal training in science. However, Aubrey's approach made sense to me at face value, so I purchased his book to study it further.
After completing the book, I felt that I did not have sufficient knowledge to know whether or not his ideas were worthy of serious pursuit, but I was intrigued. I added a major in biochemistry and reasoned to myself that I would commit to the study of aging until such a time as it was clear to me that such a pursuit was not feasible or a worthwhile use of my time and resources.
Now, a decade later, I have graduate-level training in research, business, and medicine. While the conversation has become much more sophisticated, the original plan holds true. I have not reached a point where I believe SENS is unworthy of serious study.
I have focused my company on translational research because I believe that this is the area where we can have the greatest impact and where the largest deficits exist among the various longevity organizations, both nonprofit and commercial.
How easy (or difficult) would it be to adapt LYSOCLEAR to target different types of waste products in lysosomes of different tissues?
The idea of LYSOCLEAR is based on enzyme replacement therapy, which has already been used extensively in a clinical setting for the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases. In principle, the concept of “upgrading lysosomes” can be extended to numerous diseases of aging. The challenge is almost always in identifying ways to efficiently and specifically target the payload to its destination.
This is somewhat easier when your target cells are well studied and express receptors known to facilitate efficient targeting, such as monocytes or (in our case) retinal pigmented epithelial cells. It is a harder technical problem for other tissue types. Broadly, though, I am optimistic that this approach can be repurposed for other diseases, either by our team or others.
What other age-related diseases could be prevented or cured by clearing the waste from lysosomes?
Atherosclerosis immediately comes to mind, and SENS Foundation has funded research to identify enzymes capable of degrading plaque components, such as 7-ketocholesterol. There is a growing body of research linking lysosomal dysfunction to a number of neurological diseases, but I am not up to date on that research, so I'll refrain from speculating.
LYSOCLEAR may be the first SENS therapy to make it to the clinic. What do you think might be the next one?
There seems to be a lot of good work and focus on delivering senolytic drugs to the clinic. Depending on how you define “SENS therapy” (i.e. based on the SENS concept or spinning out of SENS Foundation directly) I would imagine the next therapy to be in this field.
Can you tell us more about your work on acute myeloid leukemia? Do you base your approach to this disease on the OncoSENS paradigm, or is it something different?
This is an entirely different project. Some years ago, a paper was published that stated rats who were fed a nano compound called buckminsterfullerene had a doubling of their lifespan as compared to controls. However, this initial work was not a lifespan study. It was a chronic toxicology study, and the rats just happened to be allowed to live out their lives. It was underpowered and not designed as a proper lifespan study.
Given the striking apparent effect, a number of donors and investors have expressed an interest in seeing more work done in this space. However, testing this and related compounds to make mice or rats live longer does not constitute a viable translational path. We have obtained data showing that buckminsterfullerenes could be effective for treating various types of cancer or perhaps for reducing the adverse side effects from chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
Our interest is to test buckminsterfullerenes for longevity properties, but we need a disease indication that is firmly grounded in reality (i.e. acute myeloid leukaemia) to accompany our moonshot (an anti-aging drug).
In the past few years, senescent cell clearance has been a hot topic in the field of geroprotection. Would you like to work on this type of treatment as well in the future?
There are other groups that appear to be well positioned to lead the charge with senescent cell clearance, so it is unclear to me what we might be able to contribute to this work. I suspect that our attention will likely be applied towards other areas once our LYSOCLEAR program is in the clinic.
What are the main obstacles you have met at the early stage of your project? How could the general public and active supporters eventually help aging researchers the most?
The recurring challenge I see in the aging space is that the overwhelming majority of “anti-aging” researchers have little to no formal scientific training or wet lab experience (and it shows), or they are basic scientists. Virtually none have translational experience – that is, experience moving benchtop discoveries into a path towards commercialization.
Conversely, the translational scientists I have interacted with over the years are almost transactional, and they seem to be lacking the creativity and imagination of how new technologies could be applied to solve complex medical problems. Most of the people with ideas cannot execute, and most of the people who can execute lack vision.
We try to address this issue as a company by having one foot firmly in the fringe and the other firmly in the mainstream. For example, about half of our staff are futurists with a passion for anti-aging and SENS, but we balance that with experienced pharmaceutical professionals who keep us grounded and focused on actionable discoveries and a legitimate translational strategy.
Likewise, all of our drug development programs include a far-reaching “moonshot” opportunity but also a highly conservative disease indication.
Do you have any closing thoughts for the readers?
In my mind, the most important thing the public and active supporters can do to help aging research is education. I have found that a lot of supporters really approach aging science as almost a religion. A new paper comes out showing compound X improves a few biomarkers in flatworms, and suddenly people start taking that supplement.
If we want aging science to be taken seriously and become adopted as a mainstream and legitimate discipline, we need to hold the field to higher standards. That begins with top supporters becoming the most educated and vocal critics. Our company has built a transparent and open research culture.
We pursue answers to questions; we do not care about who was right and who was wrong – and everything anyone claims is a lie until it works in our hands. The result of iterating projects through such a culture is that the projects that survive have a strong basis in reality and represent viable drug development programs that have a real opportunity to work in the clinic.
We need to demand that projects we support as an anti-aging community have actionable successes and clearly defined fail points. We also need to celebrate scientists who do a good job in failing projects inexpensively and thoroughly and who don't get caught up in the hype of poorly designed studies and anecdotes.
Conclusion
We would like to thank Kelsey for taking the time to speak with us, and we wish his company success in developing LYSOCLEAR.
About 430 Goodwill employees in Toronto and the surrounding region will receive their paycheques today despite an earlier warning from the charity suggesting otherwise.
On Wednesday, Goodwill Industries of Toronto said that despite its “best efforts” it would be unable to pay employees on time as it dealt with a cash flow crisis that forced it to close 28 locations over the weekend.
That changed on Friday when CEO Keiko Nakamura issued a statement announcing that employees will now be paid by the end of the day.
In addition, Nakamura also said that records of employment would be mailed out to employees next week so they can begin the process of applying for employment insurance.
The pay will be for hours worked up to and including Jan. 16, which was the day before Goodwill locations in Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton, Newmarket, Barrie, Orillia and Brockville abruptly closed.
It remains unclear whether the employees will be granted any severance pay in the future.
“I regret the concern, anxiety and frustration the staff of Goodwill has experienced as a result of Goodwill's cash flow crisis resulting in the closing of all stores and operations,” Nakamura said in the statement. “My overriding priority since the closure of our operations has been to ensure the payment of our staff for work done. But the future of Goodwill is not assured. I am seeking the necessary support and alliances to create a constructive path forward for the organization and the many communities it serves.”
Earlier this week, the Canadian Airport Workers Union, which represents Goodwill employees, said it had spoken with investors who may be able to revive the charity's GTA operations; however it is not clear whether any formal talks have taken place on that topic.
In her statement, Nakamura said that the still believes the current crisis may present an opportunity for a transformation that allows Goodwill to continue to operate.
“I believe that possibilities for transformation and renewal of the organization will be explored with individuals and groups who value the contribution Goodwill makes to the communities it serves, its employees, donors, those seeking employment in challenging circumstances and the many families who purchase from Goodwill stores,” she said.
The CAWU has previously accused the charity of not communicating with its workers following the sudden closures and leaving many of its low-wage earners without a way to pay for the necessities of life.
Speaking with CP24 on Friday morning, union representative Moe Rutherford said that by issuing paycheques the company is at least giving employees, many of them mininum wage earners, some time.
“This is what the union has pushed for, to make sure that they got this done today,” he said. “It is a nice little chapter but hopefully we keep going and make sure the book has a happy ending at the end.”
Second Harvest says it will provide about 400 Goodwill employees with enough food to last them a week with trucks scheduled to deliver the groceries tomorrow.

The PC edition of acclaimed open-world game Grand Theft Auto V was originally scheduled to launch in fall 2014 alongside the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 editions. But developer Rockstar Games delayed the project multiple times before finally settling on an April 14 worldwide release date. GameSpot recently had the chance to speak with Rockstar North about this protracted development, and why the delays were necessary to deliver an experience that meets--and possibly exceeds--PC players' expectations.
"It comes down to bandwidth," Rockstar Toronto lead gameplay designer John Macpherson said about why GTA V is coming to PC so much later than the other editions. "We want each version of the game to be the best it can possibly be, and that means having the core members of the original GTA V team working closely with the best PC developers from across all Rockstar studios--the same crew that did great work on the PC versions of Max Payne 3, L.A. Noire, and GTA IV."
"Essentially, a large portion of the team that worked on GTA V for PS3 and Xbox 360 also worked on the PS4 and Xbox One versions and all of the GTA Online content, including Heists. Since the new generation console versions and the PC version share similar architecture, the team also continued to work on the PC version," he added. "With each version adding features and requiring the focus of the same key people, that takes time. However, the result is a PC version that draws from a huge pool of knowledge inside the team to deliver a game of the highest possible quality in every way. We're really excited for people to play GTA V on PC; it is the ultimate version of an amazing game."
Another reason the PC edition of GTA V has taken so much time to arrive comes down to Rockstar working hard to ensure the open-world game not only runs well on high-end machines, but also lower-spec rigs.
"Our focus was to make the game run well on a wide range of hardware so that as many people could experience the game as possible," Rockstar North said. "In order to do that we spent a lot of time working on making various different aspects of the game scalable and accessible to the player. There are over 25 parameters you can tweak that can optimize graphics and performance. The game will automatically optimize the settings for your hardware when you first start it up, but you have a great deal of freedom."
Check out GameSpot's previous story on GTA V's extensive PC graphics options to learn more.
In addition, Rockstar North said that GTA V's Rockstar Editor, a PC-only toolset that will allow players to create gameplay clips and share them with the world, was a "huge addition" that required extra time.
Rockstar North's Alex Hadjadj, GTA V's technical director for graphics, says players who have held out this long for the PC edition of the game are in for a treat. The PC version will be the best-looking version of the open-world game (provided your PC can handle it), running at 60fps and featuring population density sliders and better depth of field than the console editions.
"The most striking aspect is the ability to run the game at 60 frames per second, and to view the game in 4k resolution," he said. "Other improvements are more subtle--the addition of the population density slider means players can alter the traffic population of the city. Also, when pushing settings at the high end, a lot of the effects in the game, like reflections, skins, or depth of field are more subtle and realistic than on console versions."
Finally, Macpherson addressed the topic of modding for GTA V on PC. He wouldn't say much, but did suggest that any mods that find their way into GTA Online, the game's multiplayer mode, will be removed if they negatively affect the experience.
"Since GTA Online has such a massive and vibrant community, our primary focus is making sure that nothing detracts from that experience or has a negative impact on the overall community of players," he said.
GameSpot's full interview with Rockstar touches on even more subjects, including the developer's thoughts about virtual reality, what keeps the team enthusiastic about working on a project for 5+ years, and lots more. Check out the full interview here.
While the hack of the Clinton Foundation was foreshadowed two months ago, moments ago notorious hacker Gufficer 2.0, who previously was responsible for hacking the DNC and DNCC not to mention the resignation of Debbie Wasserman Shultz, announced that the moment "many of you have been waiting for" has come, by revealing that the Clinton Foundation has been hacked.
This is what Guccifer 2.0, who has denied being affiliated with the Russian government claiming that like the original Guccifer he is from Romania, posted moments ago on his website:
So, this is the moment. I hacked the Clinton Foundation server and downloaded hundreds of thousands of docs and donors' databases. Hillary Clinton and her staff don't even bother about the information security. It was just a matter of time to gain access to the Clinton Foundation server.
The unknown hacker has allegedly exposed 1,000 of Hillary donors (a small list of master donors can be found here)...
...corporate donations made to various House representatives....
...as well as Wall Street bank donations, curiously cross-referenced to how much TARP funding they received.
As Guccifer notes," It looks like big banks and corporations agreed to donate to the Democrats a certain percentage of the allocated TARP funds."
Guccifer 2.0 also posted a note to Julian Assange who was mocked on Tuesday morning after he failed to produce Clinton documents he has long claimed to have.
“P.S. I'm pleased to congratulate Wikileaks on their 10th anniversary!!!,” Guccifer 2.0 writes. “Julian, you are really cool! Stay safe and sound!"
* * *
But the most interesting, and perhaps damning, finding is the following: a root directory snapshot revealing a folder which Hillary may have some trouble explaining: "Pay to Play"
The hacker also provides a link to the hundreds of thousands of other documents he has access to saying "I can't post all databases here for they're too large. I'm looking for a better way to release them now."
We will go through the files, with a focus on Pay to Play because this may be the clearest confirmation that after repeated accusations that the Clinton Foundation was primarily a conduit for rich donors to get access to privileged kickbacks, or well "pay to play", this was indeed the case, although the fact that someone actually left a folder with that name in the foundation's server makes us wonder if someone is really that stupid, or whether this hack is even real.
To be sure, as The Hill notes, some of the files contained in the leaked data dump appear to originate not from the Foundation but from the DNCC:
A sampling of the posted documents include a spreadsheet of big bank donations, a list of primarily California donors, an outdated spreadsheet of some Republican House members — and a screenshot of files he claimed to have obtained, one of which was titled “Pay to Play.” But there are a number of red flags that suggest the documents are in fact from a previous hack on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), not a new hack on the Clinton Foundation. A spot check of some of the people on the donor list against FEC filings found that they all lined up with DCCC contributions. The Clinton Foundation discloses its donors, and many of the alleged donors published by Guccifer 2.0 do not appear to have given to the organization. One spreadsheet was allegedly created by a Kevin C. McKeon at DCCC in 2009. There was a Kevin McKeon that worked at DCCC at that time.
The Clinton Foundation has denied the hack, with president Donna Shalala saying that “none of the files or folders shown are ours.”
Thousands of people in Poland took to the streets on Tuesday to protest for women's rights, exactly a year after the country's Black Protest marches made international news.
Crowds of women dressed in black protested against a law proposed by a pro-life group to ban all abortions in Poland.
Poland's abortion laws are already among the strictest in the European Union and are allowed only if the fetus is the result of rape, endangers the mother's life or wellbeing, or is extremely ill or deformed.
The demonstrators were also protesting against a new law passed earlier this year to make the "morning-after" emergency contraception pill available by prescription only and collected signatures on a petition for more lax abortion laws.
Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi attended the protest in Warsaw and said she "was proud [Polish women] were defending your rights".
Several dozen counter-protesters gathered behind a wall of police officers in Warsaw, carrying posters which read "Abortion today, Auschwitz tomorrow" and "Aborters kill Down Syndrome children".
Demonstrations were also held in other Polish cities and abroad.
On 3 October 2016, tens of thousands of women marched against an earlier bill which also advocated against abortions. (vb/pk)

According to recent reports in the mainstream media, Steve Bannon is a supporter of “ethno-nationalism,” and that is scary. It is also, since everything the left doesn't like is slapped with this label, “racist.” Sometimes, the word “white” is thrown in the mix of charges to make them extra scary, as in this tweet from the Southern Poverty Law Center. (If Bannon is a “white nationalist,” what work is “ethno” doing in that tweet? Or if he is really an “ethno-nationalist,” why is “white” thrown in except as a propaganda technique?)
To make their point, people are citing quotes from Bannon like this one: “‘When two-thirds or three-quarters of the C.E.O.s in Silicon Valley are from South Asia or from Asia, I think …' he said, trailing off midsentence before continuing a moment later, ‘a country is more than an economy. We're a civic society.'”
The website Quartz claims that “the distinction between nationalism and white nationalism may seem like splitting hairs from a liberal perspective”—an odd claim, since a nationalist would claim that our government should put the interest of all Americans (many of whom are not white) first, something we have heard repeatedly from Trump, while a white nationalist would say that only about white Americans. The site then goes on to say that Bannon believes all Americans kind of have their place, “so long as white Protestants remain, as it were, first among equals.” Which would be a pretty weird thing for Bannon to think, given he is Irish-Catholic: it would amount to him advocating that his own people never be other than second place.
I don't know if Bannon would call himself an ethno-nationalist or not. But if he did, would it be a bad thing? I suggest not: ethno-nationalism is the core idea underlying the existence of nation-states, and has nothing whatsoever to do with racist nationalism.
Advertisement
First of all, “ethno-nationalism” is deeply woven into the very notion of the nation-state. The Greek word ethnos, used frequently in the New Testament, is often translated as “nation”: the idea of “a people” and that of a nation were seen as tightly linked. Millennia later, when progressives sought to redraw the map of Europe after WWI, they did so under the principle that each “ethnos” should have its own nation-state. Wilson's Fourteen Points stresses the principle that each ethnos should be free to develop “autonomously.”
To darkly hint that “ethno-nationalism” really means “white nationalism,” as some critics of Bannon seem to be doing, is hinting nonsense. A vast majority of African-Americans are, in the ethno-nationalist sense, “more American” than anyone in my family: the ancestors of most African-Americans arrived here in the 1700s, while my ancestors did so only in the late 1800s. Native Americans are also obviously “more American” than anyone of European descent, and many Hispanic families have been in this country for a century and a half or more.
But it is not merely those with extended ancestries in America who are part of our ethnos: anyone who is here legally, even if they arrived yesterday, has joined our nation. Perhaps you believe that the level of legal immigration has been too high over the past decades. Whether that is correct or not, past is: it is certainly not the fault of legal immigrants if our laws were too permissive in allowing immigration. Now that they have been legally allowed to join our nation, they are a part of it, and deserve the same protection and consideration as every other member.
“Ethno-nationalism,” as I understand the term, asserts only that we, who are living here as citizens, are Americans, and that the foremost end of our government is to protect us and our rights. This idea (properly understood) does not imply any hostility toward people from other countries. It simply means that it is their governments that are tasked with protecting them and promoting their well-being, while our government is tasked with protecting us and promoting our well-being. Nations are certainly not families and their citizens are not children, but in some respects there are useful analogies between the two: that I recognize that I am firstly responsible for caring for my own children does not mean I am hostile to other people's children, or that I am “pedophobic.”
And so, as I believe both Bannon and Trump would assert, if the globalists seek to flood our country with low-wage laborers from the third world, they are first and foremost betraying their duty to our African-American fellow citizens, who, due to the terrible history of people of African descent in this country, tend to be lower-wage workers. When unemployment is running, depending upon how one counts, at 30-60 percent for young black men (Trump may have overstated this figure, but his point stands nevertheless), what are we doing bringing millions of low-wage workers into the country, a policy that can only ensure that the African-American unemployment rate will continue to remain unacceptably high?
And many of the Hispanics who are in the country legally also suffer from competition from those immigrating illegally: the latter can be compelled to work for low wages under poor conditions because of their precarious legal status. Every legal Hispanic immigrant working in the service industries would benefit tremendously from not having to compete with illegal immigrants willing to do the same jobs for much lower wages.
And what of Bannon's worry about the number of foreign-born CEOs in Silicon Valley? Well, culture is a deep, complex thing, and it takes time to “become” an American culturally, or a Mongolian, or a Honduran. If I moved with my family to Honduras tomorrow, it probably would not be until the generation of my grandchildren that our family would be “fully Honduran,” culturally speaking, although we might be full citizens well before that. I don't believe that Bannon was disparaging the great accomplishments of these immigrants, or suggesting that anyone should strip them of their positions because they are from Asia. I think he was only suggesting that it is difficult to form a workable, coherent culture when the number of newcomers is so high.
I don't know Steve Bannon, and I have only read a small amount of his written output, and that only in the process of writing this piece. (In fact, I don't recall ever visiting Breitbart.com before undertaking this assignment.) Perhaps, given my limited knowledge of him, Bannon really is, secretly, a “white nationalist,” despite his repeated public rejection of white nationalism. Perhaps he really is, secretly, a supporter of the racist elements of the alt-right, despite the fact that he has said he has “zero tolerance” for those elements. Perhaps he really is, secretly, anti-Semitic, despite his strong support for Israel (a support too strong, by my standards), and despite the character testimony provided for him by many Jews. But the evidence that Bannon holds these hidden views, as far as I have been able to examine it, is pathetic, and entirely inadequate to support such serious charges. No competent prosecutor would ever bring a case against a suspect based on such flimsy evidence.
So is there an alternative hypothesis as to why Bannon has been attacked in this fashion? Well, let us imagine that there is a globalist elite that doesn't really care at all about the American people. When the housing crisis hit in 2007, instead of bailing out low-income homeowners (many of whom were African-American and Hispanic) who had been duped into taking on adjustable-rate mortgages that only someone with a degree in finance could understand, they instead bailed out the bankers who had made such loans. Instead of worrying about the impact of massive immigration on the lives our our own most vulnerable citizens (many of whom are African-American and Hispanic), they celebrated such immigration, since, after all, it provided them with cheap gardeners and nannies and maids, and their factories with cheap assembly-line workers. Now imagine that they are threatened by the possible ascendancy into power of people who do actually believe that the American government should put the interest of American citizens, be they black or Hispanic or white or Asian, first in our government's policies? I would imagine that this (entirely imagined on my part!) elite would embark on a relentless smear campaign against anyone expressing such “ethno-nationalist” concern for our own citizens on the part of our own government, so that they could continue to enrich themselves at the expense of the rest of us.
Dear reader, please decide for yourself which hypothesis is most probable.

ANKARA (Sputnik)Car bomb explosion allegedly carried out by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) left nine servicemen and eight civilians dead in the Semdinli district of the Hakkari province in southeast Turkey, governor Cuneyit Orhan Toprak said Sunday.
"Terrorist attack in Semdinli resulted in death of 17 people, including nine servicemen with 27 others wounded," Toprak told NTV broadcaster.
Earlier in the day, local media reported that six Turkish soldiers were killed and another seven wounded as result of the explosion.
Turkish security forces have repeatedly carried out operations against members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) outlawed by Ankara in the Hakkari province.
A senior citizen brushing up on her English by watching movies was wrongfully rejected from a theater last Saturday, her son has revealed. The elderly woman, who had been given a "brick, slider-type" cellphone to hold by her husband, was told by two police officers she had been seen recording the movie.
While recording a movie strictly for personal use is entirely legal in UK cinemas, the same definitely cannot be said about the United States. Recording or ‘camming' a movie in the U.S. can result in jail-time, particularly if the activity is connected to subsequent bootlegging or illegal online distribution.
This strict approach is the result of intense Hollywood lobbying during the last decade, and there can be few cinema-goers today who haven't been touched by the results. Bag searches and night-vision goggles are now used to deter ‘cammers', coupled with industry-funded rewards programs aimed at vigilant theater workers.
This climate of fear hasn't stopped cammed copies of movies turning up online, but it has sucked in a few innocent victims over the years. If a new report from Utah is to be believed, another one can now be added to the list.
According to Provo resident Enos Ledezma, his elderly parents go to the movies several times a week. They find it both entertaining and practical, since it allows them to brush up on their English.
However, this past weekend things weren't so enjoyable when Ledezma's mother stood accused of illegally camming a movie in a Cinemark theater.
Ledezma says that part-way through the movie his father had to leave, but before doing so handed his wife a “brick, slider-type” cellphone. She apparently put the device in her pocket, but shortly after was confronted by not only a Cinemark employee, but also two police officers.
The trio reportedly informed the woman she had been seen recording the movie and would therefore have to leave, but due to her poor grasp of English the woman didn't fully understand what was going on. Attempting to hand over her phone for inspection didn't ease the situation either.
The woman was eventually ejected from the theater and not allowed to watch the remainder of the film, even after the false allegations were withdrawn.
Ledezma told KSL that it's possible that another cinema-goer saw the theater-provided closed-captioning device next to his mother and presumed it was a bootlegging tool, but that was still no excuse for mistreating a regular customer.
While it seems unlikely that the woman broke the law (the police officers would have seen any footage by accessing her cellphone), it occurred to us that she may have broken Cinemark's policy on using cellphones in the theater.
However, this somewhat amusing footage, filmed in a Cinemark theater by someone using a Nintendo DS, seems to clear up that cellphones are allowed, as long as they're silent.
And here's the thing. If anything, the footage from the DS in the clip above is likely to be better than that obtained from what appears to be an old cellphone. This kind of end result is definitely not a threat to the movie industry, even if the woman had been recording, which it appears she was not.
Interestingly and this case aside, Cinemark actually approaches the cellphone-in-theater problem in an innovative way. If visitors have a smartphone with the Cinemark app installed, switching over to CineMode darkens the screen for the duration of the movie. If that state is maintained right to the end, users can pick up rewards, such as a free drink.
But even in the event Ledezma's mother upgrades to an iPhone, it's unlikely she'll be taking advantage of the offer.
“At the moment, I have no intention of going back to that Cinemark. I'd rather drive 45 minutes to the Megaplex,” Ledezma concludes.
Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne says a former banking executive will help guide the province's bid to become the home of Amazon's new corporate headquarters.
The online retail giant announced earlier this week that it planned to establish a second North American office, and many cities have already expressed their interest in the project.
Wynne joined their ranks on Saturday, announcing she had named former TD Bank chief executive Ed Clark as the head of a group tasked with landing the project.

Clark, who retired from TD in 2014, now serves as Wynne's business adviser.
Wynne says Clark will head a group of business leaders who will work to secure Amazon's interest in locating its headquarters in Ontario.
Toronto Mayor John Tory has already expressed keen interest in bidding to make Toronto Amazon's next home.
Amazon says that it will spend more than $5-billion (U.S.) to build another headquarters in North America to house as many as 50,000 employees. The technology company plans to stay in its current Seattle headquarters and the new space will be "a full equal" of its current home, said Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos.
Cities have until Oct. 19 to apply through a special website, and Amazon said it will make a final decision next year.
While many cities will likely be clamouring to make their pitch to Amazon as well, candidates must meet specific requirements to be considered. Key criteria include: a prime location, access to mass transit and proximity to an international airport. Any potential site must have room to grow, as Amazon wants to expand its new headquarters to as much as eight million square feet in the next decade. That's about the same size as its current home in Seattle.
Other Canadian cities, such as Waterloo, Ont., or Vancouver, may also fit the bill.

Amazon said its search is open to any metropolitan area in North America that meets the parameters. The city itself doesn't necessarily have to be one million people, but declined to say how open it was to going outside of the United States.
Amazon's current campus in Seattle takes up 8.1 million square feet, has 33 buildings and 24 restaurants and is home to more than 40,000 employees. At the second headquarters, Amazon said it will hire up to 50,000 new full-time employees over the next 15 years who would have an average pay of more than $100,000 a year.

NEW YORK, June 12 (Reuters) - Within the next two weeks, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule in a major case that could make it much harder for shareholders to band together against public companies in securities fraud class actions.
If the court rules in favor of Halliburton and against a group of shareholders, then the oilfield services company won't be the only business to gain. A handful of other major companies would also likely reap immediate benefit.
Those companies, including drugmakers Merck & Co Inc and Pfizer Inc, bank HSBC Holdings Plc and Regions Financial Corp, and casino company Las Vegas Sands Corp, are defendants in shareholder lawsuits that have been granted class action status.
A decision setting a higher bar for class actions would not end the lawsuits, but it would allow these defendants to file briefs demanding that shareholders have to again seek court approval for the status - and this time under a new, tougher standard. If they fail to get that approval, the cases would effectively end.
In 2013, settlements were reached in 67 cases totaling $4.8 billion, according to Cornerstone Research. A ruling in the oil company's favor in Halliburton v. Erica P. John Fund could save other businesses facing pending class actions hundreds of millions of dollars collectively.
Around 200 shareholder class actions are filed every year alleging that misleading statements and material omissions made by companies and their executives caused a stock's share price to drop. Nearly 400 shareholder securities class actions are pending in various stages of litigation, according to data gathered by the Stanford Law School Securities Class Action Clearinghouse.
But only a relatively small number of the pending cases have been granted class action status. In each instance, a judge must determine at a certification hearing whether the status is appropriate. One consideration is whether the people in the class have common issues or merely related ones. To be a class, they must have common issues.
'FRAUD ON THE MARKET'
Class certification is a critical stage in shareholder class actions because it puts pressure on defendants to settle by increasing the liability they face.
Generally, the larger the class size, the more damages a company faces and the more that plaintiffs' lawyers can make. Law firms can receive as much as a third of the settlement in attorneys' fees.
In the case before the Supreme Court, Halliburton is seeking to overturn a 1988 decision, Basic v. Levinson, which adopted the "fraud on the market theory." Under the theory, a defendant's material misrepresentation that affects the price of publicly traded securities is presumed to have been relied on by a purchaser who suffered a loss.
That theory assumes public information about a company is known to the market and plaintiffs do not have to show that they relied on a specific misrepresentation, only that they purchased shares before the truth came out.
In the case against Halliburton, shareholders alleged it understated asbestos liabilities while overstating both revenues in its engineering and construction business and the benefits of its merger with Dresser Industries.
The court has several options, including leaving intact Basic v. Levinson to maintain the status quo. At the other extreme, it could overturn Basic v. Levinson - and so doom securities class actions by requiring plaintiffs to show they relied on misinformation when they purchased securities.
A third option would be to find a middle ground that would require plaintiffs to show that the misrepresentation had a significant effect on the stock price but that would not overturn Basic. During oral arguments, some of the justices appeared to signal that the middle option would be their preference.
The middle option would still be a win for the defendant corporations by creating more hurdles for shareholders to clear before being allowed to sue as a group.
Merck is facing one of the largest pending shareholder cases that already has class action status.
The lawsuit, filed in 2005, alleges that the company made misleading statements about its painkiller drug Vioxx, which the company withdrew from the market in 2004 over concerns that it increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The plaintiffs alleged that after Merck disclosed the problems with Vioxx, its market capitalization shrunk by billions of dollars.
In January 2013, U.S. District Judge Stanley Chesler of New Jersey certified a class of individuals and entities who purchased Merck securities from May 21, 1999, to Sept. 29, 2004.
HALT IN THE PROCEEDINGS
Foreshadowing the potential impact of the Halliburton decision, a lawyer for Merck in November asked a federal judge in New Jersey to put a halt to proceedings in the case pending the outcome of the Supreme Court decision in Halliburton. The lawyer said the plaintiffs' case rested squarely on the fraud on the market theory and that part of the case would likely have to be re-litigated following the Halliburton decision.
The court denied the request.
Merck and an attorney for the plaintiffs had no comment on the potential impact of Halliburton on the case.
HSBC could also benefit from the Supreme Court's ruling. The bank is appealing a $2.46 billion judgment against one of the company's units, formerly known as Household International Inc. The plaintiffs alleged that Household was engaged in systemic predatory lending and that it misrepresented the credit quality of its loan portfolio.
The judgment, entered by a federal judge in Chicago last year, was the largest ever following a securities fraud class action trial, according to the plaintiffs' law firm.
On appeal to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, lawyers for HSBC are seeking an order vacating the judgment and sending the case back to the district court. In a brief filed in February, HSBC said that if the Supreme Court jettisons Basic's presumption of reliance on a misrepresentation, a class status review "will be beyond question."
Pfizer is facing a trial later this year over allegations made by shareholders that it fraudulently misrepresented the safety of its Celebrex and Bextra pain-relieving drugs. The lawsuit covers investors who bought Pfizer stock between Oct. 31, 2000, and Oct. 19, 2005, a period in which the company's share price fell by roughly half and its market value tumbled by well over $100 billion.
Openly gay “Good Morning America” host Robin Roberts appears on the cover of Mississippi's 2016 tourism guide, and now the Mississippi native is speaking out against the state's new law that makes it legal to discriminate against LGBT people.
In her statement, Roberts says she's still proud of her Mississippian roots but says it “hurts my soul to think of anyone not feeling welcome.”
“It's always been a deeply held belief of mine that everyone, everywhere should be treated equally,” Roberts said. “I'm proud that my beloved mother and father taught me as a child growing up in Mississippi to focus on the many things we all have in common, not our few differences. And what we all deserve to have in common is the right to be treated equally.”
Roberts posed for the cover of Mississippi's 2016 tourism guide before the governor signed the anti-LGBT discrimination law, which allows businesses, individuals and “religiously affiliated organizations” to refuse to serve LGBT people.
Mississippi's new law is considered to be even more anti-LGBT than a similar bill that was passed in March in North Carolina. Last month a similar bill was rejected in Georgia.

Who among us could not fail to enjoy the harmless fun and yet enjoyably scary tales about Harry Potter, the heroic boy-wizard in an epic fight against the forces of evil?
What wonderful entertainment we have all had from the vivid imaginings of Joanna K. Rowling, that 'single-mother made good' who somehow against all the odds, managed to drag herself almost from the gutter to become a multi-billionaire and a role-model.
If only all was as it seems...
Joanna Rowling is a mind-controlled Monarch slave, selected to be the author of the stories because she exhibits the 'positives' of single parent status. She is a member of the Fabian Society and the Church of Scientology. The Church of Scientology is a CIA-run front for the Royals, Rockefellers and Rothschilds.
Around Christmas 2011, I corresponded with and spoke to a "mystery man" who claimed to be the father of JK Rowling's child, born in 1995. I believed him because of the detailed information he had.
He said that in the early 1990s, he, Jessica Mitford (1917-1996) and her husband Bob Treuhaft (1912-2003, who was apparently J.K. Rowling's 'handler') in a long train journey 'brainstormed' the entire Harry Potter story whilst JKR took copious notes.
(Jessica Mitford married Bob Treuhaft, left, in 1943. He was a Jewish Communist labor lawyer from Brooklyn . Her family were British aristocrats who married fascists. This site celebrates them.)
The story was then written by someone whom he referred to as a 'pen and ink stand', a term used to describe someone who is hired to write a story that is not their own idea.
Subsequently JKR was chosen to front it in-line with the Tavistock promotion of anything that undermines family values (i.e. her single-mother status).
He also said that it was based loosely on the CS Lewis 'Narnia' stories but qualified that by saying that he had no idea at the time that all the references to pedophilia , witchcraft, Satanism etc. were going to be incorporated.
He said there were multiple attempts on his life orchestrated by Prince Phillip himself ("Lord Voldemort" n the books.)
He also told me that the scar on Harry Potter's head is a representation of the symbol of the British Union of Fascists. Jessica Mitford's sister Diana was married to Oswald Mosley who fronted the BUF during WWII.
Jessica Mitford told him that his grandparents were Unity Valkyrie Mitford, her sister and a certain Adolf Jacobus Hitler!
[Makow note: Significantly there is a 1924 French police file card that identifies Hitler as "Adolphe Jacob Hitter." The father of Rowling's child is supposed to be Portuguese (see below) but this man had a London accent and said his name was Stephen.
Unity was indeed part of Hitler's intimate entourage from 1936 on, and there are reports that she may indeed have borne his child. ]
NAME 'DOBBY' CONFIRMS ROWLING STORY
Following these discussions, I found that Bob Treuhaft's business partner in his legal firm for almost 20 years was Dobby' Walker.
This was just her nickname but even so her Wikipedia obituary refers to her as 'Dobby Walker' and not 'Doris Walker', her real name.
'Dobby' was an elf-like character in the HP stories who was employed as a 'manservant'. Maybe this is how Treuhaft and Mitford regarded Walker?
In delving even further into Walker's background it appears that she was an active member of the Communist party in the 1940s and 1950s as were Mitford and Treuhaft.
Despite what the elite would like us to believe, there is virtually no difference between Communism and Fascism, in practice. They are 'sold' to the masses as being at the opposite ends of the political spectrum to one another but perhaps a more accurate depiction of the linear political spectrum would be to think of it as a complete circle with Fascism at 1 minute before twelve o'clock and Communisms at one minute past. For the record, Dobby Walker died in 2009.
(Current US Secretary of State before going underground.)
Also, interestingly enough, an intern by the name of Hillary Rodham worked for the law firm of Treuhaft, Walker & Bernstein in the summer of 1971.
Whatever the truth really is, and it may never be known for sure, there is far more to all this than meets the eye. The rabbit-hole goes very deep indeed.

Train-trip story confirmed in Wikipedia Rowling Entry:
After working at Amnesty International in London, Rowling and her then-boyfriend decided to move to Manchester.[23] In 1990, while she was on a four-hour-delayed train trip from Manchester to London, the idea for a story of a young boy attending a school of wizardry "came fully formed" into her mind.[39] She told The Boston Globe that "I really don't know where the idea came from. It started with Harry, then all these characters and situations came flooding into my head."[23][39] When she had reached her Clapham Junction flat, she began to write immediately.[23][40]
Gay rights advocates have gathered and marched for a few years now in Istanbul in what many have come to dub the largest gay pride event in the Muslim world.
This year, however, Turkish authorities were having none of it.
Police fired water cannon and rubber pellets at crowds gathering to take part in the pride march near the city's Taksim Square on Sunday, according to Reuters and multiple social media reports.

Although no official reasoning has been given for why this year's attempt at a parade was attacked, it happened to fall in the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and many suspect the country's religious conservatives firmly objected to the public display.
Unlike most other Muslim countries, homosexuality is not a crime in Turkey. There is, however, widespread homophobia in the country, Reuters reports.
I don't tend to write about killing sprees, serial killers, snipers and whatnot. Perhaps I'm a bit cold hearted, but I always figure that other than being spectacular, the emphasis on them misses the point – even as the Knoxville killings were happening, many many other people were being killed, raped, tortured, battered or just being crippled or dying in accidents. And I've lived in countries where life is cheap; where it costs less than what I make in a week now. Bengalis or Burmese drown in large numbers; starve in large numbers, are lined up and executed and hey, whatever. A few stories are written, and we go on.
Something about the Knoxville killings touched me, though. I saw the picture of the guy who did the killing "so ordinary" said the neighbours, "he seemed like a nice man" and I couldn't but agree. But what touched me, more, was this – a man named Greg McKendry. McKendry's dead now, and he's dead because of this: he deliberately shielded others from a shotgun blast.
You don't survive that, and he had to know it. So he knew what he was doing, and he made a decision—to put the lives of others above his own.
Then the congregants tackled the shooter, took him down, and held him for police.
Love of others, sacrifice for others, and calm collective action to deal with a threat.
They say that Unitarians are the most liberal church around.
I don't know if that's true, but in the face of tragedy, Unitarians certainly showed what liberalism should be.
Now playing: Watch this: Apple, Samsung, LG respond to WikiLeaks dump
Josh Miller/CNET
As fallout continues from WikiLeaks releasing thousands of documents claiming to show the CIA's secret hacking tools, Apple says its iPhones and iPads are safe.
That is, if you've upgraded to the latest version of its iOS software.
WikiLeaks released its "Vault 7" data dump Tuesday, accusing the CIA of knowing how to hack into operating systems that run iPhones, Android phones and Windows and Linux computers. CNET is unable to verify whether the documents are real or have been altered. But security experts said the leaks appear legitimate, according to CBS News.
The CIA had allegedly discovered "Zero Day" vulnerabilities on iOS devices but did not notify Apple, so it could continue exploiting these security holes to break into devices, according to the documents. With that kind of access, it meant hackers could even read encrypted messages on services like WhatsApp and Signal.
Late Tuesday, Apple said the majority of the vulnerabilities have already been fixed in its latest iOS update.
The most recent iOS update was released January 23 as version 10.2.1. The exploits detailed in Vault 7 were from 2013 to 2016.
"While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities," an Apple spokesman said in a statement. "We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates."
Apple said 80 percent of its users are running on the latest operating system and are safe from the majority of the CIA's alleged exploits.
Life, disrupted: In Europe, millions of refugees are still searching for a safe place to settle. Tech should be part of the solution. But is it?
Technically Incorrect: Bringing you a fresh and irreverent take on tech.
Questions answered about Bronx Hospital shooter Henry Bello (deceased, right): yes, he was an immigrant, that's what the highlighted part below about him being an "international medical graduate student" means.
His shooting up an American hospital qualifies him for our "immigrant mass murder" category. You are not going to read that he was an immigrant in the headline of any MSM source.
However, we've also been told that he was working as a "pharmacy technician". Does that mean that the Bronx Hospital was using him as cheap labor?
After he was fired for sexual harassment, Bello claimed "racism and discrimination." As I've documented, there are many cases of "disgruntled" blacks making this claim, and following it up with lethal violence.
Finally, he was allegedly seeking one particular victim, and the only one actually killed was a female doctor. So two unanswered questions:
Was this the woman he sexually harassed?
Was she a white woman?
Who Is Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Gunman Dr. Henry Bello? CBS New York, June 30, 2017 NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — The gunman who opened fire inside Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, killing a female doctor and wounding six other victims before turning the gun on himself has been identified as Dr. Henry Bello, a former hospital employee. Sources tell CBS2 he resigned in 2015 amid allegations of sexual harassment. He previously worked in family medicine. Sources say the 45-year-old was searching for one employee before opening fire. Witness Dione Morales, who said she has been coming to the hospital for 17 years, told CBS2's Valerie Castro that Bello was let go “because I guess they figured he was unstable.” “He said he was going to do this,” she said. “It was said that he said he was going to kill people two years ago when he was let go – two years.” “Now look what happened,” she added. ...Sources Bello had a limited permit to practice as an international medical graduate student and was working in family practice – in effect from 2014 to 2016.... Sources say Bello was upset after leaving the hospital, alleging racism and discrimination.

The Jaguars released offensive tackle Guy Whimper, defensive back Brandon King and quarterback John Parker Wilson on Wednesday, according to a report from John Oehser of Jaguars.com. Whimper was signed by the Jaguars in November 2010 and made 21 starts for the team, mostly at right tackle.
General manager Dave Caldwell was asked who would start at the right tackle position at the 2013 NFL Combine if the team were to play the next day and he didn't exactly give a ringing endorsement to the talent on the team, although he wasn't particularly inflammatory either. "Good thing we don't play tomorrow," Caldwell said. "We have some guys that can compete there - we still have Guy (Whimper) and Cam Bradfield and both of them have experience in the league."
Whimper had far from a huge contract, but he was scheduled to count $1.825 million against the salary cap for the Jaguars in 2013, according to Spotrac, the 19th biggest cap hit on the team, ahead of players like Andre Branch, Russell Allen and Cecil Shorts III.
King was signed to the practice squad in November 2012 and never saw the active roster, while Wilson spent the entire 2012 season on the Jaguars practice squad with the exception of two days in the end of October when he was added to the active roster for one game.
LAKE FOREST, Ill. -- It's not cheap feeding hungry Bears.
Chicago Bears defensive end Israel Idonije tweeted this photo of the fake bill teammate Shea McClellin was presented after dinner Tuesday night at Mastro's Steakhouse. (@iidonije Twitter/)
Chicago rookie Shea McClellin learned that when he was handed a dinner tab for more than $38,000. Good thing for him, it was only a joke.
The Bears decided to play a prank Tuesday night at Mastro's Steakhouse in Chicago when they handed their first-round draft pick and practice-squad defensive end Aston Whiteside a bill for $38,091.91 after a rookie night dinner.
Veteran defensive end Israel Idonije says "they didn't know what to do with themselves" and watched for about five minutes as they discussed how they were going to pay for it before they were told the tab was phony. McClellin told reporters the actual bill was for more than $10,000.
Idonije posted a picture of the fake receipt on his Twitter account.

Scientists at the University of Miami's (UM's) Rosenstiel School of Marine & Atmospheric Science have found an intriguing relationship between hurricane tracks and climate variability.
Angela Colbert, a graduate student in Meteorology & Physical Oceanography, with the collaboration of Professor and Associate Dean for Professional Masters, Dr. Brian Soden, studied data from the Atlantic gathered between 1950-2010, unlocking some noteworthy results, which appear in the American Meteorological Society's Journal of Climate.
Storms were classified into three different categories based on their projected paths: straight moving, recurving landfall, or recurving ocean. Storms that develop farther south and/or west in the tropical Atlantic are more likely to become straight moving storms that ultimately affect the Gulf Coast of the United States and the Western Caribbean. However, storms that form more north or east have a greater chance to threaten the Eastern seaboard or simply recurve into the open ocean.
Perhaps the most significant finding was that El Niño seasons are not only associated with fewer storms overall, but those storms that do form are less likely to make landfall due to changes in the atmospheric steering currents.
"In a typical El Niño season, we found that storms have a higher probability of curving back out into the ocean as opposed to threatening to make landfall along the East Coast of the US due to a change in the circulation across the Atlantic. This is important for not only weather forecasting, but insurance companies, who can use these findings when determining seasonal and yearly quote rates," said Colbert.
In contrast La Niña seasons, when the equatorial Pacific Ocean surface is cooler than normal, are associated with both greater numbers of storms and an increased likelihood that they will make landfall.
"Growing up in Florida I have always been fascinated not only with hurricanes, but with severe weather in general. I wanted to better understand tropical cyclones and why they sometimes seem to follow certain tracks throughout a season or longer, so we can better prepare for them," she added.
Colbert is a graduate of Palm Harbor University High School and received her Bachelor's degree in Mathematics Education from the University of Central Florida and her Master's degree in Meteorology and Physical Oceanography from the University of Miami. She is a member of the American Meteorological Society and American Geophysical Union, and serves as President of UM's Marine Science Graduate Student Organization.

Palmquist Farm in Brantwood, Wisconsin has over twenty miles of cross-country ski trails. Along these miles of ski trails are many pine trees. I never tire of pine trees covered with snow along a trail. Some sections of trail at Palmquist are quite narrow, so it is a lot of fun skiing through narrow corridors of snowy pines. Enough of the writing though: these pictures speak for themselves.

SOCIALIST TD Clare Daly was back behind the wheel of her car after being arrested on suspicion of drink-driving.
THE embattled politician refused to comment on the incident today as she drove away from her Dublin home.
She has admitted to taking hot whiskey for a cold before getting into her car yesterday.
Deputy Daly was stopped by gardai on the South Circular Road after making an illegal turn at 12.15am.
She did not provide a breath sample to gardai but agreed to provide a urine sample when she was taken to Kilmainham Garda Station. This is now undergoing analysis to determine if Daly was over the drink-drive limit.
When the Herald called to her house today, a man answered the door and said she was not in.
He then drove her car into the driveway close to the front door, and blocked a photographer as Daly jumped into the car and left the estate.
The Dublin North TD has been at the forefront of a recent high-profile campaign highlighting the alleged quashing of penalty points for motorists by garda officers.
She now has to wait to see whether she is to be charged with a drink-driving offence.
Daly was stopped by gardai after taking what was claimed to be an illegal right turn.
Arrested
The crew of a passing patrol car flagged down her vehicle.
One of the gardai believed that she had been drinking and she was asked to undergo an breath test at the side of the road.
It is understood she was unable to take the breath test and opted to provide a urine sample.
She was arrested and brought to the garda station, where she provided a sample.
Daly said she was driving in an area of south Dublin that was unfamiliar to her and had taken an illegal turn. This led to her being stopped.
"I had been with family and had been given a hot whiskey for a cold. If that brought me over the limit then that's obviously a very serious mistake on my part and one that I take full responsibility for," Daly told RTE News.
"I am a little bit surprised that garda authorities released this information without any charges being brought or any confirmation of me being over the limit," she added.

Madison — Republicans in the Legislature unveiled a bill Thursday that would ban abortions 20 weeks after fertilization, staking out an approach tried by abortion opponents in other states, where it has resulted in court battles.
Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who is preparing a likely run for the presidency, said in March he would sign such a measure, even though he declined to detail his position on the matter when he ran for re-election last year.
"The purpose of this legislation is to prevent unborn children from feeling pain," the bill's sponsors wrote to their colleagues in a memo Thursday.
The bill would make it a felony for doctors to perform abortions at 20 weeks after fertilization. Those who do could be imprisoned for up to 31/2 years and fined up to $10,000.
A woman who received an abortion would be able to sue the doctor for damages. The father of the unborn child could also sue, unless the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest.
Despite GOP control of the Legislature, the measure could face some hurdles. For instance, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) would like to see the bill modified to allow exceptions for cases of rape and incest, a spokeswoman for him said.
Legislative leaders have not established a timeline for the bill, but Senate President Mary Lazich (R-New Berlin) said she would like to see the measure passed by this summer. The proposed abortion ban includes an exception when the life of a woman is at risk, but Lazich said she didn't want to include rape and incest exceptions.
"This is about not inflicting pain," said Lazich, one of the bill's sponsors. "It's about not inflicting cruel and unusual punishment. We don't want to see cruel and unusual punishment for some babies and not other babies."
Citing a 2005 study by the Journal of the American Medical Association, opponents of the bill disputed the claims of Lazich and others that fetuses could feel pain at 20 weeks. They said the bill would interfere with women's health care choices, arguing many later-term abortions are made when women who want to bring their pregnancies to term learn of serious fetal anomalies.
"As legislators, we are not in a position to make informed medical choices for others," said a statement from Sen. Nikiya Harris Dodd (D-Milwaukee). "This bill intrudes into the rights of Wisconsin individuals to make private decisions affecting their health care and their families."
Thirteen states ban abortion 18 or 20 weeks after fertilization, and West Virginia has a ban that is slated to go into effect in June. The bans in three of those states have been blocked by courts, leaving 10 states with bans in effect. Information about bans elsewhere comes from the Guttmacher Institute, the National Right to Life Committee and news reports. The Guttmacher Institute supports abortion rights and the National Right to Life Committee opposes them.
Rep. Jesse Kremer (R-Kewaskum), another sponsor of the measure, said in a statement that lawmakers had an obligation to prevent the "barbaric and painful mutilation of little children."
The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2012 opposed similar legislation in Congress, citing the 2005 JAMA study, which reviewed then-available evidence and found that fetuses are unlikely to feel pain before the third trimester of a pregnancy, which starts around 28 weeks. The group contended no new studies "have changed this dominant view of the medical profession."
Heather Weininger, executive director of Wisconsin Right to Life, called those findings outdated. The bill is her group's top priority this legislative session.
Weininger and other backers of the Wisconsin bill did not name specific studies, but the National Right to Life Committee has quoted doctors at institutions such as the University of Minnesota and Case Western University who say fetuses are capable of feeling pain at 20 weeks.
The National Right to Life Committee has also cited a 2007 article in the journal Behavioral and Brain Sciences as an example of evidence that fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks. But the author of that study told The New York Times in 2013 his research had only a "marginal bearing" on fetal pain.
Wisconsin law bans abortions once fetuses achieve viability, which generally happens at 24 weeks.
The use of late-term abortions in Wisconsin is infrequent and is falling even faster than the practice as a whole. In 2013, late abortions made up just 1% of the total procedures done in Wisconsin, according to state figures.
The governor told reporters at the Wisconsin Center in Milwaukee that the bill is a reasonable measure that should become law.
"I'm pro-life, but I think whether you're pro-life or not, after five months — when an unborn child can feel pain and when there are inherent risks in terms of procedure — I think, pro-life or not, the majority of people believe that that's a realistic requirement going forward," Walker said. "That's something I hope the Legislature will pass."
In cases where a woman's life was in danger at 20 weeks or later, doctors would have to end the pregnancy in a way that made it most likely the fetus would survive outside the womb.
Sen. Jon Erpenbach (D-Middleton) said he believed the release of the abortion bill amid the hectic time of budget writing in the Capitol is meant to distract the public from the GOP agenda as it considers cuts to the University of Wisconsin System.
"It's a diversion tactic," Erpenbach said.
The legislation comes less than two months after a federal judge declared unconstitutional an earlier abortion regulation approved by Republicans. In 2013, lawmakers and Walker approved a bill requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of where they performed an abortion.
Planned Parenthood and another abortion provider sued. U.S. District Judge William Conley immediately blocked the law while he considered the case and in March ruled the requirement infringed on a woman's constitutional right to seek abortions. Walker and Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel have appealed the ruling.
If the 20-week abortion ban is passed, both sides said litigation was likely. That could take years to resolve.
In his re-election bid last year, Walker ran an ad saying the admitting privileges law he approved was aimed at patient safety and that he understood the decision to terminate a pregnancy was an "agonizing one."
In recent months, Walker has taken a more vocal stand against abortion. In March, he signed a letter promising to sign a 20-week ban on abortion.
"I will sign that bill when it gets to my desk and support similar legislation on the federal level," he wrote in the letter.

Apple has won the hearts and minds of small- and mid-sized businesses, which have overwhelmingly adopted Cupertino's mobile devices over rivals powered by Android or Windows, an Exchange hosting vendor said last week.
According to Intermedia, 76% of the customer-activated mobile devices for the year through October ran iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. The majority of them were iPhones.
Samsung and Motorola mobile devices -- both of those companies rely mostly on Android -- came in second and third with 12% and less than 6%, respectively.
Windows-powered smartphones and tablets accounted for just 1% of all activations in the 10-month period, about the same as the sinking BlackBerry.
Intermedia measured mobile device preferences by tallying activations of ActiveSync, Microsoft's de facto industry-standard synchronization service that keeps email, calendars and contacts in step on smartphones and tablets. Mountain View, Calif.-based Intermedia claims to be the world's largest Exchange hosting service outside Microsoft itself, and touts 90,000 customers that serve 700,000 users.
Mobile PCs, such as notebooks, were not included in Intermedia's numbers, as they access the hosted Exchange servers directly, without needing ActiveSync.
But the company's statistic revealed some notable trends, said Michael Gold, Intermedia's president.
"Interestingly, iPad activations have held relatively steady over the last 36 months, even as iPhone activations have continued to grow," Gold said in an email reply to questions. In October, for example, iPhone activations outnumbered those for iPads by more than four to one.
Since the introduction and start-of-sales for 2013's iPhone models, small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) have picked the more expensive iPhone 5S 82% of the time, said Intermedia. Its conclusion: Businesses have prioritized functionality over price.
About 23% of the devices activated in the first 10 months of 2013 were from vendors that power the bulk of their smartphones and tablets with Google's Android, giving iOS an advantage of better than three to one.
And Gold was bullish on Microsoft, even though its Windows Phone and Windows operating systems accounted for a puny percentage of activated devices from January through October.
"Windows smartphone and tablet activations ... grew by roughly 93% over [the] period," Gold wrote in an email. "Microsoft's planned purchase of Nokia, along with their aggressive mobile agenda, could make them a viable threat to Samsung and even Apple in the medium term."
Perhaps.
But data on Surface tablet activations provided by Intermedia at Computerworld's request showed that Microsoft's own hardware brand has gained little ground in the SMB space, a market the Redmond, Wash. company dominates on the desktop and one it's hoping can be convinced to swing from iOS and Android.
During the last three months of 2012 and the first ten of 2013, Intermedia counted just 1,700 Surface activations of all types, or less than half the number of iPads for October alone. Surface RT tablets, the lower-priced of the two lines, dominated, accounting for 62% of all Surface activations.
Both the Surface RT and the first-generation Surface Pro showed up in higher numbers on Intermedia's log at their sales start -- October 2012 for the former, February 2013 for the latter -- then trailed off significantly. Surface RT activations, however, began to climb in July, when Microsoft slashed prices to get rid of excess inventory, and then hit a 10-month high in October 2013, when Microsoft rolled out the second-generation Surface 2 but continued to sell the original for $349.
Apple's iPhone and iPad combined to account for more than three-fourths of all mobile devices activated by SMBs on the world's largest Exchange hosting service. (Image: Intermedia.)

UPDATE (Nov. 13, 1:00 p.m.): Ronda Rousey defends her bantamweight title against Holly Holm this weekend in Australia. We wrote the story below before Rousey knocked out Bethe Correia in 34 seconds in August.
Ronda Rousey is the rare athlete who dominates her sport while transcending it. You might recognize her from a cameo in the recent “Entourage” movie, or maybe you read about her in The New Yorker. Or maybe you saw clips of her last fight — all 14 seconds of it.
But in case you've been living in a pacifist commune, know this much: Rousey is the best female mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter in the world. Top male fighters are wary of facing her. With an 11-0 record going into her much-publicized fight against Bethe Correia on Saturday, she's arguably the biggest draw — man or woman — in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), the biggest MMA promotion league.
Beyond being simply “the best,” the former Olympian in judo — who, in the 2008 games in Beijing, became the first American woman to medal in the sport — is known for winning astonishingly fast. Her previous two fights lasted 30 seconds. Combined.
Plotted below is the winning percentage of 2,135 MMA fighters (men and women) who have won at least three fights. On the x-axis is what I'm calling a fighter's “fight speed score” — a measure of how much time is left in the fights they won versus how much is remaining in the bouts they lost. On average, Rousey has won her 11 fights with 90 percent of the scheduled fight time remaining; only three of her fights took more than 66 seconds. Combined with her undefeated record, this blazing-fast track record makes her a Lionel Messi-like outlier.
Rousey's quick fights are totally counter to the MMA trend overall. In the early 2000s, the average fight in the three-round, five-minute format lasted about 400 seconds for men and less than that for women. But in 2015, the typical fight went nearly two rounds (or about 600 seconds).
Longer fights might be a product of the changing nature of MMA. It's likely that, as MMA has become more popular, the competitive parity has risen too. And so it's possible that fighters, facing more fearsome and equally matched opponents, are tweaking their tactics to be more risk-averse — to bide their time for an opportunity to strike, rather than coming in with the all-out aggressiveness that characterized the early days of the sport. Whatever the reason, today's fighters don't end fights like they used to.
In the MMA of the past, fights were most likely to end when a fighter knocked another unconscious or twisted an opponent's limb until he said “uncle” — but those days are over. Instead, MMA fights increasingly end with both fighters standing, which forces judges to make the call. There are essentially three ways a fight can end: a decision, a knockout (KO) or technical knockout (TKO), or a submission, which is when a fighter verbally or physically “taps out,” usually by being in a vulnerable position such as a chokehold.
This is what's happened to those three outcomes over the past 15 years:
Submissions are down from about 45 percent of all fights in 2000 to 25 percent in 2015. That more fights end with a decision explains the longer fights, and could be a reflection of improving competitive parity in the sport. There are fewer instances of pros quickly pummeling their opponent.
But Rousey is an exception. She has won all her fights by a submission or KO. Rousey has won nine of her 11 fights with the “armbar” submission — a move where Rousey hyperextends her opponent's elbow, causing excruciating pain and sometimes gruesome results.
And, interestingly, among fights ending in a submission, fewer are done with an armbar.
Rousey's favored armbar technique made up more than 35 percent of submissions in 2000. But now the armbar is used in less than 15 percent of submissions. Replacing it are choking moves such as the “guillotine” and “rear naked choke.”
Although Rousey's ways of winning are increasingly at odds with MMA trends, bettors seem to be confident she will continue winning. The betting odds from the Westgate Las Vegas Superbook put Rousey as a -1700 favorite against Correia (as of July 27). So one must bet $1,700 on Rousey to net $100 if she wins. She's still a huge favorite. But Correia is also undefeated (9-0) and has beaten two of Rousey's training partners.
Rousey's dominance has been a boon for MMA — and for female athletes more broadly. There's no use resisting it. Just submit.

Alaska Continues to Bake, on Track For Hottest Year
Alaska just can't seem to shake the fever it has been running. This spring was easily the hottest the state has ever recorded and it contributed to a year-to-date temperature that is more than 10°F (5.5°C) above average, according to data released Wednesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
How many spring temperatures differed from average during the spring in Alaska.

The Lower 48, meanwhile, had its warmest spring since the record-breaking scorcher of 2012.
While May as a whole was only slightly above average — thanks in part to whiplashing weather from the beginning of the month to the end — every state in the contiguous U.S. had warmer-than-normal temperatures for the spring as a whole.
The main area of relative cool in May was in the Central and Southern plains, where considerable rains fell during the month. Storm systems generally tend to drag in cooler air and cloudy days help to keep a lid on temperatures.
“In addition, when soils are waterlogged it prevents afternoon temperatures from rising as high as they would if soils were dry,” Deke Arndt, chief of the monitoring branch of NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, said in an email.
The contiguous U.S. is having its fourth warmest year-to-date; May's milder weather brought that trend down a bit from April when 2016 was in the No. 2 slot.
The clear standout of above-average temperatures for the Lower 48 — both in May and spring as a whole — was the coastal Pacific Northwest. Seattle had its fourth-hottest May and several spots in Washington, including Seattle-Tacoma Airport, were having their hottest year-to-date.
Alaska, for first time in modern records, had a spring average temperature of 32°F (0°C) — that may sound cold, but warmth is a relative term. That temperature handily beat the previous record hot spring of 1998 by 2°F (1°C), according to NOAA.
Several spots in Alaska, including Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau, recorded their hottest springs. Several others, including Barrow, the northernmost city in the U.S., had their second-warmest spring.
For the year-to-date, the state is running 10.3°F above the 1925-2000 average of 26.1°F (-3.3°C) and 2.4°F (1.3°C) higher than the previous mark of 23.7°F (-4.6°C) set in 1981. In fact, the past three January-May periods are among the four warmest in Alaska's records.

Rick Thoman, climate science and services manager for the NWS's Alaska region, said that several factors had converged to keep Alaska so relatively toasty, including persistent high pressure systems over the region and warm waters off the coast. Early snowmelt has also exacerbated the spring heat.
The effects of the elevated temperatures are readily apparent, Thoman said, with berries ripening weeks earlier than usual, very early “last frosts” and an early start to construction projects.
Temperatures in Alaska have also steadily risen — like the planet as a whole, and the Arctic in particular — thanks to the excess heat trapped by human emissions of greenhouse gases. There is a 99 percent chance that 2016 will be the hottest year on record globally, mainly due to that excess heat.
NOAA forecasters expect the odds this summer to continue to favor above-average temperatures across Alaska, and there's a good chance that 2016 as a whole could be record-hot for the state as well. But that depends on how the rest of the year plays out.
“Certainly, the combination of five months already in the books and the outlook for continued warmth raises the chances for the warmest year on record,” Arndt said. “But it would just take one or two really cold months to change the scenario from ‘warmest year' to ‘one of the warmest years.' ”

I am proud to share with you what I have been working on.
This is code that works with a computer and an arduino board to generate bitcoin addresses. It uses a random number generated from hardware on the arduino and uses that to generate a bitcoin address.
This is my first bitcoin code ever and I hope you guys enjoy it. If anyone that has experience with arduino or python wants to help, message me.
A reminder that the actual addresses are converted and stored on your computer so they are only as secure as your computer, but I am looking into generating and storing on arduino.
If you enjoy please let me know and if you have any questions or complaints just tell me. Thanks.
EDIT: This now includes a more secure entropy library that has been tested and shown to be random. The program also now stores private keys in the EEPROM of the arduino. It stores it from address 0-31. If you run the Random Address sketch, this overwrites any private keys currently stored on the arduino. The Read EEPROM sketch can be used to write the private key to a serial monitor, or to the generate.py script. This is the program you should have loaded on your arduino if you want to use the same address over and over. Also added a seperate generate.py file that only generates the public key. This makes sure that the private key is never written to your computer.

A new analysis based on two long-term aging studies--one of Roman Catholic nuns, the other of Japanese American men--provides what may be the most compelling evidence yet that dementia commonly results from a blend of brain ailments, rather than from a single condition. This is often the case even when an Alzheimer's diagnosis has been given, say the researchers.
A team led by Dr. Lon White, with the University of Hawaii and the Veterans Affairs-affiliated Pacific Health Research and Education Institute, analyzed data on more than 1,100 people who had taken part in the Nun Study or the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study. Both studies followed hundreds of aging adults and included brain autopsies upon their death.
The analysis by White's team appears in the March 15, 2016, issue of Neurology.
"The impact on clinical dementia and impairment is largely unrelated to the type of lesion, or type of lesion combination," said White in an email interview. "Rather, the driving factor seems to be just the total burden of disease."
The observation is not new. Based on several studies in the past few years, experts have begun to recognize "mixed pathology" dementia as a relevant model to explain the cognitive losses of older people. White notes that "even the lay public seems to now be appreciating that dementia is often the result not of a single disease process, but of a combination."
But the new study led by the Hawaii team offers the largest-scale, most comprehensive documentation of the trend to date.
The study included data on 334 nuns and 774 Japanese American men, all of whom completed multiple cognitive assessments as they grew older, and whose brains were autopsied after they died. The average age at death was around 90 for the nuns and 88 for the men.
Based on the autopsies, White's team found predictable rates of five different brain pathologies, all of which can bring on dementia. These included Alzheimer's disease, Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, microinfarcts, and low brain weight.
The researchers found signs of Alzheimer's in about half the brains. But only in about half of those cases was it the main lesion type. Among 279 participants who had severe Alzheimer's pathology, more than three-quarters had at least one other type of lesion.
Along with this, the researchers observed that most of the participants who had displayed significant levels of cognitive impairment during their final years had few or no Alzheimer's-type abnormalities.
By and large, it was combinations of ailments--rather than any single condition--that correlated most strongly with cognitive impairment. Such combinations had a "dramatic" impact on dementia risk, wrote the researchers.
The nuns with the highest level of comorbidity--the most lesion types, with the greatest overall severity--were 99 times more likely to have cognitive impairment, compared with those with no pathology.
The study documented many different combinations. There were no overarching patterns.
"There are a huge number of possible combinations of lesion types, reflecting what appears to be nearly random linkages among the types," said White. "The probability of each is largely unrelated to the probabilities of the others."
White, a neuroepidemiologist, said the effect of comorbidity appears to be multiplicative, rather than additive. This means, for example, if one type of lesion normally raises the risk of cognitive impairment by a factor of three, and another also raises it threefold, the combined risk increase from the two lesions would be not three plus three, but three times three. In other words, the older person with both lesion types would have a nine-fold risk of cognitive impairment, compared with someone without either pathology.
Says White: "I believe it's because all of these lesion types seem to be broadly distributed around the brain, each involving different neuron types and fields. So the result of their summation reflects the wiping out of multiple different systems within the brain, each required for optimal cognition."
"The bad news," he sums up, "is that it is much worse to have comorbid lesions than to have a single lesion type."
By the same token, White says, the upshot of the findings is that the opportunity to ward off dementia may be broader than currently thought.
"The good news is that preventing any [of the pathologies] will be of benefit to the process of aging-related cognitive decline. We can prevent illnesses currently diagnosed as Alzheimer's disease by preventing any of the other four lesion types, even if we cannot directly prevent the Alzheimer's lesions."
White admits there is not currently an abundance of clinical or lifestyle strategies shown to do that.
But he does underscore the importance of maintaining healthy blood pressure. High blood pressure has been implicated as a contributing factor in most of the lesion types his group studied.
"At this point," says White, "prevention by effective treatment of hypertension in midlife seems to be the only solid approach."

A still from a video shows Islamist militants destroying an ancient shrine in Timbuktu.

Armed with hammers, pickaxes, and loaded guns, Islamist extremists are tearing down Timbuktu's ancient shrines, endangering rare texts on science and mathematics.
Documents housed in the shrines include writings about astronomy, the health effects of tobacco, and 3,000-year-old medicine, according to the New Scientist. They are part of Timbuktu's “matchless collection” of about 300,000 historical Islamic texts, some dating back to the 13th century.
Since last weekend, members of Mali's Ansar Dine, an Islamist militia with alleged lies to al-Qaida, have destroyed at least eight mausoleums as well as several tombs. They say their actions come at the behest of a “divine order” to eliminate idolatrous monuments, reports Time.
After a coup in March left the country in the midst of a civil war, the Ansar Dine took control of a northern region of Mali. The group aims to impose strict Sharia law across the entire country.
Back in April, Moussa Ag Hamta, a private library owner, told Northern African news site Magharebia that he had begun hiding his collection of scientific texts. “They consider these documents to be a heresy,” he said. “Preserving them is some sort of worship, which contradicts the Islamic Sharia in their opinion.”
Some of the manuscripts may be from the Islamic world's “Golden Age” of science (750 AD to 1250 AD). “Muslims gave us Arabic numerals, algebra, algorithms, and alchemy; they gave us our names of most of the stars visible to the eye,” said Skeptoid podcast host Brian Dunning on recent episode. “Arab-Islamic doctors furthered the art of surgery, built hospitals, developed pharmacology. … [T]hey advanced art and architecture beyond what even the mighty Greeks and Romans had begun.”
While U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has criticized the militia's actions as “totally unjustified,” the Ansar Dine has remained adamant in its cause. Spokesman Sanda Ould Boumam said the group plans to “destroy every mausoleum in the city—all of them, without exception.”
Story highlights An ejection test examines a missile's "cold-launch system," which uses high pressure steam to propel a missile out of the launch canister
Carried out on land Sunday at Sinpo Naval Shipyard, this is the third such test this month
Washington (CNN) The US military has detected "highly unusual and unprecedented levels" of North Korean submarine activity and evidence of an "ejection test" in the days following Pyongyang's second intercontinental ballistic missile launch this month, a defense official told CNN on Monday.
An ejection test examines a missile's "cold-launch system," which uses high pressure steam to propel a missile out of the launch canister into the air before its engines ignite. That helps prevent flames and heat from the engine from damaging either the submarine, submersible barge or any nearby equipment used to launch the missile.
Carried out on land at Sinpo Naval Shipyard, Sunday's ejection test is the third time this month -- and fourth this year -- that North Korea has conducted a trial of the missile component that is critical to developing submarine launch capabilities, according to the US defense official.
US officials also noted that a North Korean Sang-O submarine was operating in the Yellow Sea and the length of its deployment was notable. Two Romeo submarines were detected in the waters off Japan -- each one operating in the area for about a week.

The top two surviving leaders of Cambodia's genocidal Khmer Rouge regime have expressed remorse for their actions while in power and acknowledged a degree of responsibility for the atrocities committed in their names.
Nuon Chea, the chief lieutenant of Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, and Khieu Samphan, who acted as head of state for the Maoist regime, are currently on trial for genocide and crimes against humanity.
They were responding to questions posed by the so-called civil parties, who are representing the victims' families at the United Nations-backed trial.
"As a leader, I must take responsibility for the damage, the danger to my nation," Nuon Chea said, offering "deepest condolences" to relatives of those who died.
"I feel remorseful for the crimes that were committed intentionally or unintentionally, whether or not I had known about it or not known about it," he said.
Khieu Samphan told Yim Roum Doul, whose father died during Khmer Rouge rule, that he didn't know at the time of "the atrocities committed by the military commanders and leaders."
"I feel extremely sorry for the disappearance and extremely brutal killing of your father," he said.
"I did not know the great suffering of our people," he said, adding that the perpetrators "must be brought to justice."
Pol Pot was able to exploit instability created by the Vietnam War to overthrow a weak U.S.-backed government in Cambodia in 1975. Inspired by the forced collectivization policies of Chinese leader Mao Zedong, Pol Pot then embarked on a bloody restructuring of society aimed at his vision of a utopian, agrarian state. As many as 2 million people were executed or died of disease, starvation or overwork in the regime's "killing fields."
In 1979, Vietnam invaded Cambodia and pushed Pol Pot and his remaining followers into the jungle, where they fought an unsuccessful insurgency for the next two decades. Pol Pot died in 1998 under suspicious circumstances.
In the past, both Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan have maintained that they believed at the time they were acting in the best interests of the Cambodian people and that they were unaware of the full extent of the killings.
So far, only Kaing Guek Eav — better known as Duch — who headed the regime's notorious S-21 prison has been held accountable. Last year, he appealed to the country's U.N.-backed war crimes court to reduce his 19-year-sentence. Instead, the court increased the 69-year-old's sentence to life.
The meditation session organized by the Canada High commission in New Delhi last week was the talk of the town for the whole weekend. This was a very welcome step taken up by high commissioner of Canada in India, His Excellency Nadir Patel.
The atmosphere was full of happiness and joy. The spring in full bloom in the lawns of Canada house situated in the heart of central Delhi. The spacious lawn was filled with vibrant intelligent people from all walks of life, a few chosen ones, carefully selected from a diaspora of Delhi's elite.
They were all listening to Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, the master himself as he was speaking in his beautiful loving voice about the diversity of life.
He was talking about the diversity right there, in the flowers, their colors, their fragrance. The water that was sprouting out of the fountain in the middle of the lawns and the water that was lying on the table filled in a glass. The diversity in our food and the diversity of human beings. Mesmerized by his gentle voice and showering love, the audience were listening to him and soaking in his energy.
The joy and happiness this atmosphere created goes a long way in bringing the two countries closer. This rare gesture demonstrated by His Excellency Nadir Patel by arranging this meditation session with none other than the master himself Sri Sri Ravi Shankar is a huge step forward towards connecting with the people of India in most loving and happy manner.
A visibly very happy His Execellency Nadir Patel himself attended the meditation session along with his wife. In his welcome address he expressed confidence that this meditation session shall bring the citizens of both the countries even more closer.
FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- Muhammad Wilkerson's future with the New York Jets could be resolved on Wednesday.
Coach Todd Bowles' noncommittal comments Monday indicated the team is mulling the idea of sitting him down for the last two games or cutting him loose. Let's examine the Jets' options:
It's likely the Jets will deactivate Muhammad Wilkerson for the final two games of the season. William Hauser/USA TODAY Sports
1. Welcome him back: This wouldn't be a financially prudent decision. Wilkerson's 2018 salary ($16.8 million) is guaranteed for injury, meaning the Jets could be on the hook if he were to suffer a serious injury in these final two games. They don't want to be on the hook for anything because they're expected to release him before the third day of the league year in March, when his salary becomes fully guaranteed if he's on the roster. They've paid him nearly $37 million for the last two seasons; they don't want to pay him a dollar more than they have to.
2. Deactivate him for the final two games: This is the most likely scenario. Bowles can call it a "coach's decision" based upon the recent disciplinary issues with Wilkerson, who showed up late for a meeting last Friday and was promptly benched for the game in New Orleans. Two weeks earlier, he was benched for a quarter for the same reason. Bowles is fed up and could tell Wilkerson to stay home in what would amount to a paid vacation -- $1.7 million for two weeks. This would eliminate the injury risk. One of the most celebrated examples of this type of punishment occurred in 2005 with the Philadelphia Eagles and Terrell Owens.
3. Cut him: They wouldn't save any money -- his last two game checks are fully guaranteed -- but it would be a powerful statement. The salary-cap ramifications would be the same as if they waited until February, meaning they'd save $11 million on the '18 caps and would get stuck with a $9 million "dead" charge. The downside to cutting him now: They wouldn't have the option of using the June 1 designation that would allow them to spread the cap hit over 2018 and 2019. Because the Jets have a vast amount of cap space in 2018, the June 1 factor isn't viewed as significant. Wilkerson probably wouldn't mind getting a pink slip now because he'd be free to sign with a contender after clearing waivers.
4. Suspend him without pay: They could call it conduct detrimental to the team, but it's a hard-line approach that likely wouldn't pass the smell test from the NFL Players' Association.
Ben Whishaw admits that he was completely blindsided by this one. Hailed as one of the finest actors of his generation, the 32-year-old is about to play the MI6 boffin Q – all gadgets and geekiness — in Skyfall, the new Bond movie. But, he confesses, “I absolutely did not see the offer coming.”
Sam Mendes, the director of the film, had invited him for dinner. “I thought we were going to be discussing a Shakespeare project,” recalls Whishaw.
Bond is big. In fact, it's the biggest movie franchise in cinema history. But for all that, Whishaw says that he could not immediately take in what he had agreed to. “When Sam first offered me the part of Q, I didn't really understand the magnitude of it. Even when we were filming, it didn't sink in. I didn't want to dwell on it. I'd have been paralysed by the weight of expectations.”
Dressed in a black polo neck and blue trousers — an ensemble that wouldn't look out of place on Bond himself – Whishaw is sitting opposite me on a sofa somewhere in central London. Slender and stubbly, he appears initially nervous as he distractedly picks at a sandwich. But I soon realise that he is appealingly shy.
Whishaw displays an attractive strain of the trait we Brits prize above all others: modesty. His Hamlet for Trevor Nunn in 2004 – his debut on the West End stage – was met with widespread acclaim, yet when I ask for his reaction to the fact that some critics have called him “the next Olivier”, he squirms and pulls his polo neck right up over his head.
His first day's shooting as Q was something of a trauma. The production moved into the National Gallery overnight for the scene in which Q first meets Bond (Daniel Craig).
“It was very weird,” the actor smiles wryly. “It was my first-ever scene in my first-ever Bond film, and it was happening at three in the morning in the National Gallery. I didn't know what was going on. As Q, you have all these complex names to recite. I can learn Shakespeare easily enough, but trying to say some of Q's lines in the early hours of the morning was very tough indeed. I still remember going up to Sam at five in the morning feeling like my eyeballs were falling out. I just put my hand on his shoulders and said, 'Help me!' ”
In the scene, Whishaw, sporting a geek-chic outfit of anorak, thick NHS specs and greasy mop of dark hair, proves a match for Daniel Craig as Bond, and gets one of the film's key lines, already much quoted: “Were you expecting an exploding pen? We don't really go in for that any more.”
This youthful Q represents the brave new world of techno-espionage. He possesses the ability to destroy the world with one click of a computer mouse while still in his pyjamas before breakfast.
Bond, on the other hand, stands for the antiquated form of spying. He gets his way by the old-school MI6 method of seducing women and shooting men. One of the central themes of Skyfall is the hi-tech nerd versus the unreconstructed special agent.
Once he overcame his initial discombobulation, Whishaw says that he relished the role of Q. “It was such fun for me to play an expert in an area where I'm completely not an expert. I'm really hopeless with technology — I don't even have a computer. But I had to reel off all this technological information as if it were second nature.
“It's great to play someone who has this mysterious understanding of things that are so complex. I also really enjoyed his relationship with Bond. I'm very excited about future films and where we will take that.”
Whishaw, who comes from Bedfordshire, avoided studying previous Qs – Peter Burton, Desmond Llewellyn and John Cleese. “They're so iconic and such brilliant incarnations that it would have been a very heavy weight on my shoulders. It's like doing a Shakespearean role — it's best not to think too much about who's done it before.”
It is evident that the producers of Skyfall wanted this Q to go in a different direction, in any case. Whishaw says: “You can't just start from scratch — you have to tick the boxes that people want ticked. Q has to be a bit snippy, tetchy and exasperated by Bond. But I felt very strongly from the script that this Q had to be something different from the past. This is a new beginning. Casting someone younger in the role was the first clear indication that the producers wanted to shift the character and his connection with Bond.
“In the past, Q would be rummaging around in some huge suitcase. He was brilliant, but ramshackle. This Q is definitely slicker. He's a Zen character who likes everything to be simple and refined. He's pretty sharp, and Bond respects that.”
Whishaw took great pleasure in working with Craig on Skyfall. “He's incredibly intense and focused and very, very tough on himself. He's an absolute perfectionist. We're very fortunate to have him as Bond.”
On the subject of his private life, he politely declines to answer questions. He explains: “For me, it's important to keep a level of anonymity. As an actor, your job is to persuade people that you're someone else. So if you're constantly telling people about yourself, I think you're shooting yourself in the foot.”
Whishaw is about to go through a particularly high-profile period. Next month, he stars alongside Romola Garai and Dominic West in the second series of The Hour, Abi Morgan's well regarded 1950s newsroom drama for BBC Two. In 2013, he will co-star with Tom Hanks, Halle Berry and Hugh Grant in the eagerly awaited big-screen adaptation of David Mitchell's bestselling multi-narrative novel Cloud Atlas. And then comes a reunion with Judi Dench – after her latest turn as M in Skyfall – for a West End production of Peter and Alice, a new play by John Logan about the one-off meeting between the real-life people on whom Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland were based.
Beyond that, he has no grand scheme. “I have never had a plan — no, no, no,” he says, shaking his head vigorously. “All I ever wanted to do was act. If I can keep working with good people and doing the things I love, that's really enough for me.”
'Skyfall' opens today.
The Boston Red Sox have re-signed shortstop Stephen Drew to a one year deal worth approximately $10 million -- the pro-rated portion of the $14.1 million qualifying offer he rejected at the end of 2013 -- according to various national writers on Twitter.
Third baseman Will Middlebrooks was just placed on the disabled list with a fractured finger, which opens up a spot in the infield for Drew. Since Boston was the team that made the qualifying offer to Drew, they will not lose a draft pick for signing him. Apparently, no team was going to sign Drew prior to the draft, so there was no point in Boston waiting until post-draft to sign Drew.
This leaves Kendrys Morales as the last major free agent. Morales could re-sign with Seattle prior to the draft, but otherwise, it seems almost certain Morales will not sign with anyone until after the draft, when he will no longer cost the signing team a draft pick.
Are Cocktails More Potent at High Altitudes?
For some people, ordering a cocktail on a long flight can be a delightful way to unwind, or even doze. But there are reasons to think twice before you drink. Dr. Linda C. Degutis, the director of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said that the air inside a plane cabin tends to have a humidity level of 10 to 20 percent, which is lower than the typical indoor humidity level of 30 to 65 percent — so passengers are more likely to become dehydrated. Consuming alcohol in the cabin can further increase dehydration (especially if you had a drink before boarding).
The United States Department of Transportation also cautions travelers that the dry cabin air in combination with alcohol (or coffee, mind you) may increase your chances of contracting a respiratory infection.
Still unsure about whether to order a glass of wine? A pilot safety brochure from the Federal Aviation Administration notes that “alcohol decreases the ability of the brain to make use of oxygen” — an effect that can be magnified by altitude. Not to mention that alcohol impairs reaction time and judgment, both of which are crucial in an emergency. This is especially important to consider if seated in an exit row. “Drinking alcohol can slow the response as well as a passenger's ability to follow the crew's instruction,” Dr. Degutis said, “and this can put other passengers at risk.”

There can be problems beyond the flight, too. “Consuming alcohol on the plane when one has to get in a car and drive home or to another destination after landing can be dangerous,” Dr. Degutis said. “There are reports of people who have become intoxicated during a flight and crashed after leaving the airport, injuring or killing themselves or others.”
Are Checked Bags Often Lost or Damaged?
Not as often as you might think. The Department of Transportation's Air Travel Consumer Report includes a “mishandled baggage rate,” which Bill Mosley, a spokesman for the department, said combines lost, delayed, damaged and stolen bags. In May, there were 2.77 reports per 1,000 passengers. That's better than the same period a year ago, when there were 3.54 reports per 1,000 passengers.
In general, most people are reunited with their bags (even if they temporarily go astray), according to the Aviation Consumer Protection Division, which monitors compliance with, and investigates violations of, the Department of Transportation's requirements. To give your bags the best possible chance of arriving when you do, the division advises passengers to check in early and remove luggage tags from previous trips. Also, try to fly nonstop: bags are more likely to be misplaced when passengers change airplanes and airlines. For tips about packing and what to do if you lose a bag, visit airconsumer.ost.dot.gov .
Is the Air Vent Making You Sick?
The expert consensus is that you're more likely to get sick from a sneezing seatmate or from touching the bathroom sink than from recirculated cabin air. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the cabin air is mixed with outside air and recirculated air, and most new-model planes pass the recirculated air through high-efficiency particulate air filters meant to capture 99.9 percent of tiny particles like bacteria and fungi. The center has reported that transmission of the flu is thought to be mainly through large droplets, meaning that the closer you sit to an infected person, the higher your risk for exposure. ( Boeing even explains on its Web site that “essentially no microorganism can pass through the high efficiency filters in the air recirculation system on today's jets.”) Your best bet? Hand sanitizer. And keep your fingers crossed for a healthy seatmate.
Can Portable Electronic Devices Harm the Plane?
It comes down to this: better safe than sorry. The Federal Aviation Administration says there are still unknowns about how the radio signals that personal electronic devices (including cellphones) give off might affect aircraft communications, navigation and flight control. Cellphone use, which sends out strong signals, is banned by the Federal Communications Commission because of its potential to disrupt wireless networks on the ground.
And if you're wondering why Wi-Fi is not yet more widely available, here's the reason: For each model of aircraft that a Wi-Fi system is to be used on, the manufacturer must get F.A.A. certification for the system, and the airline must get F.A.A. operational approval. That means testing the equipment to show that it doesn't interfere with systems during flight.

“As with any regulation, safety is always our top priority, and we will make no changes until it is certain they will not impact safety and security,” the agency said in a statement when asked about portable electronic devices. “However, the F.A.A. recognizes this is an area of consumer interest and is exploring ways to bring together key stakeholders to explore the issue further.” In the meantime, have a little patience and, if need be, a break from your e-mail.
It was no minor miracle that the Bears defense held Colin Kaepernick to only 17 points in the first half, a fact that the 49ers seemed all too aware of as they opened the second half. The home team put together a beautiful drive, methodically driving the ball down until they found themselves in the shadow of their goalposts. But with the Bears' slim hope for a comeback on the line, rookies and young players like Ego Ferguson, Will Sutton, Jon Bostic, Kyle Fuller, and Shea McClellin all came up big, holding the Niners to a field goal and keeping their hope of victory alive.
It was clear on first down that that Niners wanted to pound the ball into the end zone with a run, but the Bears put in an eleven-man effort to turn them back on this first play:
Start by watching DTs Ego Ferguson (95) and Will Sutton (93). Sutton gets blown way back by a double team, but Ferguson plays it cool, pushing his man into the gap that Sutton just left open. With Jared Allen holding the other edge of that lane, Gore isn't able to hit the gap behind his left guard.
Now take a peek at the right side of the shot. Ryan Mundy (21) and Lance Briggs eat up the two lead blockers on the edge, leaving Kyle Fuller unblocked on the edge. As such, Gore can't get through on the other side of his left tackle, so he tries to bounce it out to the right edge of the offense. Although he overpursued the play a bit, Willie Young (97) is able to keep Gore from hitting the next hole, the one off right tackle. With Young keeping Gore from turning up the field, Kyle Fuller and Shea McClellin get Gore in their sights and take him down before the veteran RB can make the turn upfield for six.
Since there was nothing doing on the left side of the defensive front on first down, the Niners tried their luck on the right side for this next play. But while the play-call was different, the result was the same:
Again, start by watching rookies Sutton and Ferguson in the defensive interior. Ferguson makes a great move off the snap, swimming over the back of the right guard, and Sutton holds his gap much better than he did on the last play. Better still, Lamarr Houston (99) busts through a double team, leaving no room on the interior for Gore to exploit. The interesting thing about this play, however, is the personnel group - Willie Young is in as a fifth defensive linesman. He gets leverage off of the fullback's block, and is able to extend his outside arm to hold up Gore just enough to slow him down. Before Gore can get going again, Lance Briggs and Jon Bostic to join Young for the gang tackle and drop him for a loss.
It's a unique player group here, to be sure, but proved to be the perfect response to the heavy set that San Francisco put out on the field. Also, I really like how Shea McClellin is deployed on this play and the one prior - he's given edge contain duties on both. By setting him up to get a clean look at the backfield, Shea is able to use his greatest asset - speed - to his advantage. As such, the "rookie" linebacker is not only able to hold his lane at the snap, but also hustle to the ball after it goes the other way. As a result, McClellin is able to help with both group tackles on these plays.
With the left and right sides proving unbreakable, the Niners tried to push the ball in straight up the middle. And while you can't tell from this angle, they spread the field with three wide on third down, leaving only the front seven to defend against this up-the-gut run call. The linebackers and linesmen showed they could handle the Niners' vaunted offensive line to get this final stop:
The San Francisco interior gets zero push against Sutton and Stephen Paea on the interior, and the Niners fullback completely misses the kick-out block on Willie Young. Unblocked, the new Bears DE swung into the backfield to take out Gore's legs from underneath him, making Stephen Paea's job a whole lot easier: all the big man has to do is fall down on the RB to notch the tackle. The Bears hold, and the Niners are forced to settle for three.
While there were many turning points in the game - Kyle Fuller's two interceptions, the Cutler-to-Marshall touchdowns, and some bad defensive penalties by San Francisco that kept drives alive - this goal-line stand is the biggest of the bunch to me. If the Niners were able to offset the Bears touchdown from the end of the second quarter with a score here, it would have been that much tougher for Cutler to take the lead and hold it. Add in just how demoralizing a touchdown would be after such a long drive, and you'd have a recipe for a rout.
With some great play-calls by Mel Tucker and even better execution by the young defensive players, the Bears were able to hold here, and the D left the door open enough for Jay Cutler to sneak through another three touchdown passes and a win. While I don't see the Jets as quite the threat on offense that the Niners are, if the Bears defense can stay this stout against the run, they'll have plenty of opportunities to get those big INTs against second-year man Geno Smith. Here's to hoping that Trestman's prime-time luck and the upward trend of the Bears defense both continue on Monday.
Cam Newton

AUBURN, Alabama -- Cam Newton is scheduled to graduate from Auburn University in May 2015, and perhaps sooner if he can find some free time to enroll in two more classes in the summer or fall.
The All-Pro quarterback with the Carolina Panthers took three courses this spring while bouncing between Charlotte and the Plains, and recovering from a surgery on an injured ankle in March.
The former Heisman winner at Auburn provided a behind-the-scenes peek at a recent study session -- a "CrAM-sess1on(lol) as he calls it -- on Instagram on Wednesday.
"This is my LAST CrAM-sess1on(lol) before my last 2 finals of this semester!" Newton writes on his Instagram account. "I will have 2 more credited hours to complete before I graduate but, I will be happy when it's all over and I will finally fulfill the promise I made to my mom to graduate and get a college degree! Because LORD knows this process has been burdening at times, BUT I KNOW IT WILL BE WELL WORTH 1T, in the long run!"
The spring semester at Auburn ended May 2. Summer classes are scheduled to begin Friday.
Newton doesn't have much free time, but has spent the last two spring semesters splitting time between Charlotte and Auburn as he tries to complete coursework.
Newton underwent surgery to tighten ligaments in an ankle in March. Recovery time was expected to span four months.
One Well Brewing Company
Several months before setting out on my Smitten With The Mitten beercation through Michigan, I knew that Kalamazoo would have to be a stop. I soon came to realize that I know a miniscule amount of the other breweries in Kalamazoo other than Bell's. So, I took to Reddit to see if I could get some expert opinions on where else I should stop. Reddit user, twoldofs, commented on my post with the following reply, “I'm biased because I live in Kalamazoo and own a brewery here, but our beer scene is pretty awesome. I'd recommend taking a day or two here to check out as many breweries as you can. Either way, Michigan is great for craft beer so I'm sure you will have good time. Cheers!” It turns out that user twoldofs is TJ from One Well. After further communication, I was all set to visit his brewery!
Upon dialing up the One Well Brewing Company website, I realized right away why this is a place I have to visit. A playful cartoonish image of a wood, a wizard, and a yeti introduce me to One Well's brand. The yeti represents TJ Waldofsky and the wizard represents Chris O'Neill. TJ kindly set up a meeting for me to come into the brewery and meet with his co-owner, Chris. I arrive 3 in the afternoon and see fun murals on the windows outside.
Upon entering, I see a welcoming and cozy area with mugs hanging down like beer stalactites. I grab a seat at the bar next to Chris. As a small token of my thanks for meeting with him, I present him with a bottle of Surly Darkness. The only thing I tell him is that he has to share the bottle with TJ.
How One Well Started
Chris is an affable and laid back dude who is fun to talk beer with. I ask him about how One Well came to be and he spins the yarn. Most of TJ and Chris's business plans are written on post-its from National City Bank. In the planning phase, Chris and TJ figure they have to save a lot of money to make the venture go. Since they are comfortable living on a bare-bones budget, they save with the discipline of monastic accountants. Between money from their parents' 401Ks and money that Chris and TJ save, they come up with enough start-up cash to put the plan into action.
They decide on the space that used to be occupied by Sunset BLVD Brewing. They looked at other locations first, but each of those required a total build out and that didn't suit their budget. This location also gives them a well-populated area in Kalamazoo to draw from. As for places to grab a beer, there aren't many other places around One Well, so the location makes a lot of sense.
Their aim is creating the feel of the college bar that Chris frequented because he enjoyed knowing a lot of people at his local watering hole. Chris continues to say that One Well had to be a place where cool people could have a cool place to hang out. Chris and TJ relied on lots of words of mouth advertising at first. Chris notes that people are likely to spread the word about a good spot if they have a positive experience. That is exactly what happened.
One Well starts with a 3 BBL system. More than half of what they raise goes toward equipment and another sizable chunk to lawyers. Chris and TJ start One Well with five employees and are now they are up to 40. Chris describes managing his staff in a unique manner, “It's like I'm dating 40 people.” What makes managing employees palatable is that they are in the habit of giving good jobs to good people.
When One Well began, Chris and TJ figured that if they sold 50 beers a night on Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday and then kicked it into high gear on the weekends by selling 100 beers each on Friday and Saturday night, they would be able to make a go of it. Well, they did that and more. Things went so well that they paid their parents back within the first 6 months of being open.
Chris and TJ have created a gathering spot for many to come and enjoy some fabulous beers. So many people enjoy this place that they decided to buy the business on the other side of the wall and expand. One Well was getting pretty packed and it was taking away from the patron experience. The expanded space allows for way more capacity, all the while still maintaining a cozy and communal feel.
I mentioned that Chris is laid back. He recalls the interview of their 6th employee, a graphic designer, who showed up in a shirt and a tie. Chris said he told Mike at the interview, “We really like you, but never come to a meeting with a tie on again.” Mike started up Stuffed Brain Studio and his graphic designs are killer. Not only do they want their community of patrons to be comfortable, but they also insist that their employees do the same.
One Well Brewing's Beers
Community comes first, but the beer is a close second. I am impressed by the beers on tap. In fact, while Chris and I are visiting, he generously procures flights of everything that they have on tap. The styles run the gamut from low on the lovibond scale to dark as night. Do not judge the beers by their color because not all is what it seems. What I have to say about One Well is that their beers are well above average. One Well brews beers that you can ponder, discuss, and enjoy. They do sweet, hoppy, complex, tart, refreshing, and roasty. Several of the beers I am drinking simply blow me away.
Professor Nutbutters
Peanut butter beers are all the rage right now. In a market that seems to be more crowded by the day with variations using this ingredient, Professor Nutbutters absolutely separates One Well from the pack. This beer is a liquid peanut butter sandwich. Think roast, bread, and childhood satisfaction. This beer is sensational and unique. I can honestly say I have never had anything quite like it.
Xalapa
I am Minnesotan and so spice in a beer can be a bit of a risk. I enjoy chilis and peppers in beer. Notably, I like the vegetal and pepper flavor. A little bit of heat that builds over time is fantastic. Xalapa is everything I want in a beer with jalapeños in it. The nose of this beer immediately gets me in the mood for some Mexican food. Great pepper character in the nose, but a wonderfully deft use of spice in the beer. This beer is not a palate wrecker. Instead of wrecking your palate, this beer dims the lights, puts on the Barry White, and ransacks your palate's erogenous zones with amazing flavor and aroma. My god this beer is fabulous. Go there now and pray it is on tap!
Only Gose To Show Lime
During our interview, Chris went to attend to some brewery matters while I enjoyed a burrito. More on the burrito later, but when Chris returned, he had a beer with him. It was a Lime Gose that they didn't have on tap and I am pretty sure he summoned an eagle to get it from their production facility. I love limes and I take them any way I can get them. In a beer or a margarita, it makes not difference to me. I just love them. This beer is cements One Well's special place in my heart. What a marvelous beer! Bright, slightly acidic, and wholly refreshing. I loved the briny and tart nature of this Gose.
Whoppy
I am going to come clean and say that hoppy wheat beers are not my jam. I am sure it is a difficult style to brew because wheat dries out the finish of a beer and keeping it hop-forward without using too much other malt can be tricky. Yet, One Well's hoppy wheat ale, the Whoppy, is none of those bad things to me. Whoppy is crisp with a perfect hop bit at the end that keeps me wanting more sips.
Bad Adz Brown
There is lots of fancy wood in the taproom. This artistic excellence is thanks to Bad Adz Custom Wood Design. The man behind the design and artistry is Tim Overhuel. Tim is a craftsman and a magician all in one. The shelves that he made for the taproom are amazing. It seems fitting that One Well would brew an amazing brown ale in homage to Tim's craftsmanship. This brown ale is so roasty and smooth. A lot of times a brown ale is an obligatory style a brewery feels they have to have. For me, these obligatory styles fall woefully short of being even an average beer.
Each sip of beer affirms why I came to One Well. Chris asks me about which ones I enjoy the most. I say that is easier to tell him which ones aren't my favorite. The Root Beer Float Stout needs more balance because it comes off too sweet for my palate. I like the feel and the aroma, just too sweet. The only other beer I am not going to order a full pour of is the SimcoeRillo. There is something about the amarillo hop that gives off an onion/garlic aroma and it is not my favorite. Again, no flaws in the beers, just not my palate.
I try all 16 of the beers that Chris throws at me. I enjoyed the other beers that I had, but wanted to write about my highlights. When you go to One Well, you will see that they don't brew any bad beer.
About That Burrito. . .
One Well, like other breweries in Michigan, takes food seriously. Their menu is streamlined and inviting. They have something for everyone. Their menu changes often and they are always inventing new ways to tempt your taste buds with culinary delights. I decide on the burrito that is stuffed with meat, guacamole, jalapeños, and french fries. This baby is a stoner's delight. I devour it ravenously, so ravenously that I forget to take a picture 🙁 I guess that means it never happened. . . When you go to One Well, make sure you bring your appetite because their food is creative and delicious.
A True Beer Community
Chris is one of the most welcoming guys I have ever met in the beer world. He has countless ways in which he makes patrons and people who work at One Well feel part of something greater than themselves. During my visit with Chris, I saw people from Bell's come in, other employees here on their day off, and many other regulars. Chris greets all of them with a high five and a smile. In fact, on the website, the mantra, “High fives over hugs!” is prominently displayed.
One Well's Mug Club
A sub-community at One Well is their mug club. I ask Chris how the mug club started and in his typical dry and perfect comedic timing he replies, “So, we ripped off Dark Horse.” Chris wants his patrons to have something special. They sold 100 mugs at $150.00 a piece. The beautiful mugs are the artistic creations of Jovonnah Nicholson in Grand Rapids. Once you are in the mug club you get a dollar off a beer for the rest of your life, early access to special release beers, and a 10% off on merchandise. The mugs are all unique and one of a kind; seemingly in line with how One Well is to the Michigan beer scene.
The biggest takeaway from my visit is how many One Well employees I see coming in for a beer on their day off. If I ever show up at my job on my day off, you will know that my body has been inhabited by aliens. There is a familial vibe at One Well and that is why it isn't uncommon to see proud employees drinking a beer there on their day off. If I lived in Kalamazoo, One Well would be my local haunt. I love the people I meet and the character of the place. Community is not something that can be faked. It happens organically and because of hard work. TJ and Chris have put much of themselves into One Well and the success is validation for them taking the leap to create a place where all are welcome.

MONTCLAIR, NJ – Singer, rock musician, Ted Nugent is scheduled to perform at the Wellmont Theater despite a growing number of protestors. Grassroots organizers, labor unions, and individuals have expressed that they plan to protest the Ted Nugent performance scheduled for July 22.
Elected officials and protest organizers have acknowledged that Nugent has a First Amendment right to Free Speech, but have taken issue with his publicized comments that were described as ‘offensive' by many. Despite the controversy surrounding some of Nugent's publicized statements, he also has many supporters.
When learning about Nugent's scheduled Wellmont Theater performance, New Jersey Director of CWA, Hetty Rosenstein, stated that her initial reaction was to notify the establishment of her concern. She expresed that she tried calling the theater for over two months. Leaving at least 4 messages at the Wellmont box office, Rosenstein further mentioned that she never received a call back before deciding to organize.

Wellmont Theater Executive Director, Mark Josephson responded on Wednesday evening. “We've been receiving phone calls and messages, but we don't always respond to every message we get, it's just impossible. I also wasn't trying to be evasive, but I just got the message. Our phone system is cranky sometimes and we are thinking about upgrading the system,” said Josephson.
Besides being a Reality TV star, Outdoor Channel Host and rock musician/singer, Nugent is also known for being vocal on matters concerning hunting, conservation, and gun ownership rights, thus earning him both protestors and supporters. He has also been a board member of the NRA since 1995.
CWA and BlueWaveNJ have teamed up with other local and national organizations to organize a protest outside of the Wellmont Theater concert. Another organization, NJCitizenAction has confirmed that they are involved in co-organizing the protest.
Phyllis Salowe-Kaye, Executive Director of New Jersey Citizen Action, said, "There is no place for hate, racism, homophobia, violence or intolerance. Not in Montclair, New Jersey or any place in this country. Ted Nugent 's comments are despicable and the management of the Wellmont should not be providing a platform for someone who spews such garbage. We are urging our members to come out on Tuesday evening to protest Nugent's backwards and extremist views and to urge the Wellmont to cancel his appearance."
As of Thursday, Nugent at the Wellmont ticket sales were less than 50% sold with 9 tickets available for resale.
CWA has circulated fliers and posted to their ‘Protest Ted Nugent in Montclair' facebook page some of the statements that Nugent has made.
In a January 18 interview, Nugent, who is also known as The Motor City Madman, had to abruptly end the news interview below after referring to President Obama as a ‘chimpanzee' and Hillary Clinton as having 'spare scrotums'.
In February of 2014, NY Magazine published a Tweet from Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky) stating the following about Nugent's publicly expressed comments, “Ted Nugent's derogatory description of President Obama is offensive and has no place in politics. He should apologize.”

Josephson added, “I personally sympathize with protesters, but we also know that he's a controversial figure. Canceling the show is not an option.” “He's still going to play here. The Wellmont Theater is freedom of speech place.”
After learning of Josephson's comments on behalf of the Wellmont Theater, and his expressed intent to allow Nugent to continue to perform, Rosenstein said, “This isn't a First Amendment issue. Nobody is precluding Ted Nugent from speaking. It is a question as to whether or not the Wellmont Theatre in a community such as Essex County, New Jersey brings in or seeks to make a profit from a notorious bigot.”
In August of 2007, Nugent is recorded during a live performance calling Senator Hillary Clinton a, “…worthless b*tch…” He went further to add that Senator Barbara Boxer, “…might want to suck on my machine gun…”
Marcia Marley, President of BlueWaveNJ, said, "While we support Mr. Nugent's right to free expression under the First Amendment, we also support every citizen's right to protest bigotry and intolerance. We hope others will join us in speaking out."
Among the supporters of the protestors is Montclair Deputy Mayor Robert Russo, who expressed, "I will join the others on Tuesday to condemn this performer's comments and protest his presence in Montclair."
After learning that Live Nation was promoting the concert, phone calls to media relations officials at Live Nation were returned and officials declined to comment.
“We're not in the business of censoring people or telling Live Nation how to run their business. They are employed by us. The Wellmont Theater is privately owned by New York real estate investors who do not wish to get involved in anything controversial. They like to stay private," said Josephson. “Montclair is a liberal town and we would like to regard ourselves as members in good standing of the community, so if people want to speak their opinions, then more power to them. They have every right and are welcome to protest, just as other people have the right to speak their minds".
Rosenstein continued, “Ted Nugent preys on outrageous opinions. He uses his musical platform to express hatred and incite people. We have a First Amendment right, but more importantly, a community responsibility to say that his conduct is not acceptable in our community.”
Clinton's fallout is interestingly causing an internal revolution among Hillary's big donors. At her New York bash to “thank” her big donors of $1 million or more, she took no blame and pointed the finger at Comey and Putin. Her spin did not work and she has lost a lot of credibility according to confidential sources. They were smart enough to realize that even if Russia “hacked” the DNC and Podesta emails, there would be no release if there had been no wrongdoing to begin with.
Now Clinton's biggest backers want a “campaign autopsy,” which could expose Clinton's entire operation. The donors are demanding to know where Clinton spent the near $1.5 billion in campaign resources she collected in the closing months. They want the receipts. They are demanding an honest investigation of how Clinton failed to read the mood in swing states and how her Brooklyn operation misread polling data.
The donors are not buying the Russian hack story. Putin isn't the only explanation for her failure and they are now pointing the finger at Hillary. She never bothered to go to Wisconsin. The story running behind the curtain is that fundraisers are cutting off all donations to the Democratic Party until this honest review is carried out. They do not want to hear about Comey and Putin.
Foreign governments have been cutting off funds to the Clinton Foundation. At last, the money is being cut off. Bill Clinton has lost it, mocking President-elect Donald Trump's intelligence. “[Trump] doesn't know much,” Bill Clinton said of Trump. “One thing he does know is how to get angry, white men to vote for him.” Bill is keeping it racist and gender oriented. Obviously, Bill is lashing out because the Clinton money machine came to a screeching halt.
Happy SMART Day Everyone!
Do you know whether you're and innie or an outie? While those terms usually refer to a belly button, they apply even better when you are asking about a person's spirituality. In other words, is your spiritual life inner-directed or outer-directed? And it doesn't really matter what religion you practice. If you live your life based upon what others tell you to do, be, have or care about—even if that “other” is a spiritual leader of sorts—then you are outer-directed. If you instead listen to your own soul—especially in matters of the heart and spirit—then you are an innie. A huge part of living SMART 365 is learning the difference and then following the still, small voice within.
I think I first learned the difference between the two options from Deepak Chopra. In case you've never heard of him before, he is the best selling author, writer and speaker who also happens to be a licensed doctor. Back in the 90s, he wrote a book called “Ageless Body, Timeless Mind.” He was the first person I had ever read that made claims like, “every cell in your body is totally aware of how you think and feel about yourself,” and “you are only as old as the information that swirls through you.” He was also the first person with any authority who said, “People who age successfully…were those who ‘stayed in training' throughout their adult lives in three major areas: physical activity, psychological and intellectual activity, and social relationships.” Plus, he was the first who used the words “self-referral”—and that of course is being an “innie.”
The opposite of this form of “innie” is an “outie” or what Deepak calls “object-referral.” He explains, “In object-referral we are always influenced by objects outside the Self, which include situations, circumstances, people, and things. In object-referral, we are constantly seeking the approval of others. Our thinking and our behavior are always in anticipation of a response. It is therefore fear-based. In object-referral, we also feel an intense need to control things. We feel an intense need for external power. The need for approval, the need to control things, and the need for external power are needs that are based on fear. “
In contrast Deepak explains that when we “…are self-referral, we identity with our inner self, the unchanging essence of our soul.” According to Deepak, the state of self-referral, “is an absence of fear, there is no compulsion to control, and no struggle for approval or external power.” Again, regardless of what spiritual tradition or religion we practice, do we listen to the world around us as an outie? Or do we listen within and follow our own guidance as an innie?
Of course, being an innie or an outie applies to just about every single aspect of our lives. It effects how and who we love, where we live, whether we experience joy and contentedness on a regular basis, whether we are active and involved, how we think about aging, whether we are optimistic or pessimistic, to even our political persuasions. Nearly every time we are affected by any choice we either listen within, or we repeat what others have told us. Much as I admire and respect Deepak Chopra for his writing and his work, I reserve the right to question what I read and hear—and we would all do well to do the same for everyone—including me!
Needless to say, it is much easier to say than to do. That's because we are all socially conditioned to pay far more attention to, and listen to, other people and the world around us—than we are to our “higher power.” In fact, the more you feel that your world is in the hands of the government, your spouse, your kids, your employer, your neighbor or even the tax man—the more your life will feel like a roller-coaster, making you feel insecure, worried and out of control. On the flip side, the more you become inner-directed, the less the circumstances and people around you will determine your happiness.
What can you do to become more of an innie? The one simple (but not easy) solution is to meditate. Again, regardless of your religion, meditation is the act of “listening” to Spirit—not petitioning or telling it what to do. That means in contrast to the way most people pray, meditation is spending time in the “still, quiet place within.” The more you do that, the more your inner life will grow and the less the outer world will dominate. Again, it's very simple, but not easy.
While I've consistently prayed throughout my lifetime in one fashion or another, meditation used to be only an occasional practice. Then about a year and a half ago, Thom and I made the commitment to sit and meditate every single day. After all this time, one particular benefit is that I now know that my inner Self is much more “real” to me than ever before. Finally when someone says to me, “You are a spiritual being having a human experience,” I really know what that means and have an awareness of the difference. I might not (yet) be a person who never cares what other people think, is completely without fear, never worries and always feels secure, but I know that I am much closer to that understanding than ever before. One day at a time, I'm becoming an innie and living my life with inner-referral. How about you?

In case you couldn't tell from the title, In the Matter of Football Association Disciplinary Proceedings Between: The Football Association (Applicant) -and- John George Terry (Respondent): Ruling of the Full Regulatory Commission Following the Substantive Disciplinary Hearing Held Between 24th and 27th September 2012 is an amazing document. If you're a soccer fan, you already know what this is about, but if not, here's the history: On October 23, 2011, during the course of a Premier League match between QPR and Chelsea, superstar Chelsea defender and then-England captain John Terry, who is white, directed a racial insult toward QPR defender Anton Ferdinand, who is biracial. The incident was captured on camera with at least a hey–let's–hire–lip readers level of clarity. It immediately prompted one of English soccer's periodic micro-apocalypses. Terry was stripped of his national-team captaincy by the FA. Fabio Capello, England's high-profile manager, resigned in protest. Crown prosecutors brought racial harassment charges against Terry. Terry pleaded not guilty, not because he denied he'd said the words but because he claimed he'd phrased them as a question, like, Whoa, hang on, did you think I just called you _____? Because I totally didn't! The magistrate found him not guilty on the grounds that not even the most expert lip readers can see question marks. The FA then launched its own independent inquiry, charging Terry with “abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour” including “a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Ferdinand.” The FA commission found Terry's all-a-big-misunderstanding defense implausible and/or contrived and/or ludicrous, fined him £220,000, and suspended him for four matches. Terry retired from international soccer in a kind of huffy disgrace.
The English football media, as you might expect, found the whole thing mildly intriguing.
Then, last Friday, the FA released its account of the case, the Ruling of the Full Regulatory Commission Following the Substantive Disciplinary etc. etc., and it makes for bizarre and fascinating reading. There's a chapter near the end of Ulysses in which Joyce frames a bit of happenstance everyday life as a question-and-answer catechism; it's a strange effect, because the super-rational form (Q&A full of scientific terminology) is comically at odds with the spontaneous drift of the content (two guys take a walk, pee on a tree, etc.). In the same way, there's something a little mind-altering about seeing the hot chaos of a soccer match translated into the composed paragraphs of a committee brief. We start out with an unfortunate encounter:
1.3 Shortly after Mr. Terry had got to his feet, he barged into Mr. Ferdinand with his shoulder. The latter reciprocated with a shoulder barge of his own and said “what are you doing?” Mr. Terry momentarily appears to kick out at Mr. Ferdinand on the film footage. Shortly afterwards, as Chelsea were attacking, the Referee stopped play after one of his Assistants had brought to his attention the altercation between Mr. Terry and Mr. Ferdinand. A free-kick was awarded to QPR. As they were still within close proximity of one another, Mr. Terry called Mr. Ferdinand “a cunt” and made a gesture with his hand across his nose, implying that Mr. Ferdinand's breath smelt. The Referee intervened, as did at least one Chelsea player.
Which quickly escalates:
1.4 Mr. Terry then proceeded to run back towards the Chelsea half in order to take up a defensive position and await the free kick. For a time, he had his back to Mr. Ferdinand. Mr. Ferdinand started to move up the pitch in the direction of the half-way line and shouted out at Mr Terry, “how can you call me a cunt, you shagged your teammate's missus, you're the cunt.” Mr. Ferdinand also made a slow fist pump gesture with his right hand, suggesting sex (a reference accompanying what he said). Once he was back in the Chelsea half of the pitch, Mr. Terry turned round to face the play and saw the fist gesture that Mr. Ferdinand was making, and which was clearly directed at him.
Leading to the moment of crisis:
1.5 At this juncture, there is no dispute on his part that Mr. Terry used the following words (although Mr. Ferdinand claims not to have heard them at the time):
“fuck off, fuck off, fucking black cunt, fucking knob-head.“
There is also no doubt that Mr. Terry said something after “fuck off, fuck off“, but before “fucking black cunt, fucking knob-head.” The available film footage of the incident, which was taken from different camera locations, shows another Chelsea player — John Obi Mikel from one angle, and Ashley Cole from another — briefly obscuring Mr. Terry's face as he uttered the missing word or words. There is a dispute as to what they were. The significance of this will be discussed in due course.
So, yeah! Fun game, soccer. Lots of good exercise, only occasional yearlong multi-phase racial-abuse scandals culminating in bureaucratic reports that read like excerpts from experimental novels.
To get the obvious thing out of the way: I have no idea what John Terry said to Anton Ferdinand between his second “fuck off” and his first “fucking black cunt.” I do not, personally, believe Terry's defense. I am glad he was fined and punished. I also have some not-fully-reconciled doubts about whether it's wise to send the law after a person for words spoken during a heated moment on an athletic field. But everything about this case was so overblown and horrible that it kind of defeats any way you might feel about it. I mean, you could argue that the trial itself was simultaneously completely necessary and a total miscarriage of justice: If you're a country, you pretty much absolutely cannot have the captain of your national soccer team yelling “fucking black cunt” at an opponent on television; on the other hand, people say terrible, dumb things when they're angry, and no one seems to think Terry is actually racist. On the other other hand, maybe a four-game ban actually feels a little light? Liverpool's Luis Suarez was banned eight games — but not subjected to a criminal trial — for racially abusing Patrice Evra last year. So who knows. If the professional yelling of sports opinions is something that appeals to you, this case is made-to-order; if not, the whole thing probably feels like the crass nightmare celebrity culture had when it toured Parliament and took the wrong blood-pressure medication. “Oooh, not good,” a friend e-mailed me when I told her I was writing about Terry, and yes, that is pretty much the final word.
What I keep thinking, whenever fresh Terry news slithers past, is that when the history of this era of soccer is written, the matter of the Football Association (Applicant) -and- John George Terry (Respondent) ought to mark the official end of England's Golden Generation. Because there was a moment — this really happened! — when the “England's Brave John Terry” nickname wasn't at all ironic; when he, David Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Michael Owen, et al. looked like plausible sports heroes who were going to accomplish great things. Think back to, say, 2004, through around the day in 2006 when Wayne Rooney's fourth metatarsal fractured. We believed, kind of, that Gerrard was a local boy made good who went drinking with Liverpool fans after matches. We thought Jamie Carragher really was a selfless fighter, that Beckham was a leader, that Owen could still recapture his form. Joe Cole was going to bring Continental flair to Chelsea, remember? They weren't favorites to win the World Cup, but they were at least going to be comfortably elite for a long time; and more important, they bled English oak, never gave up, and commanded legitimate admiration. They were exciting. The media construct seemed real, or at least real-ish.
Of course, many of the Golden Generation players had amazing success with their club teams. Lampard and Terry won multiple Premier League titles, a handful of FA Cups, and a Champions League trophy; Beckham won eight league titles in three different countries; Gerrard won one of the most dramatic European Cup finals of all time. At the international level, though, they were constantly hyped above the level of their talent while constantly performing beneath it. Their England team was better known for failing to qualify for Euro 2008, for WAG culture, for “can Lampard play with Gerrard”–type meme-kerfuffles, and for scandal than for anything they won. Terry, even before the racial-abuse charges, had been caught in an affair with the mother of one of his teammates' children; Gerrard (“went drinking with Liverpool fans”) was arrested after a bar fight; Ashley Cole cheated on his pop-star wife, theatrically betrayed Arsenal to move to Chelsea, and became maybe the most hated footballer on earth simply for having his personality. And so on.
The Golden Generation was maybe the purest experiment ever conducted in how thoroughly the mechanics of celebrity can fuck up the public lives of the people around whom they operate. Can you imagine how indulged John Terry must have been, by everyone he met, in the mid-2000s? How does your ego not run away with you, if you're never told no? If you're measuring your weekly paycheck in Bentleys while being called a hero everywhere you go? And so eventually you take things too far, or don't live up to people's (escalatingly unreasonable) expectations — you don't qualify for Euro 2008, and a story starts to circulate that you're sleeping with your wife's 16-year-old sister — and the switch flips from worship to loathing, and suddenly you're “embattled,” the media is airing your dirty laundry, and you find yourself one step outside Sextapeville. Or worse. By about 2008, most of what seemed good about the Golden Generation had been overwritten by an aura of besieged trashiness. Terry's transformation from valiant captain to aggrieved racist was — even if neither image really matched who he was — the fitting culmination of the decline of the whole group.
There's something inexpressibly diminished about most of them now, both as players (they're getting old) and as popular icons. David Beckham seems like a piece of enterprise software that's still running even though no one remembers how to log in. From Rio Ferdinand's online presence, you'd get the impression that he's become a weird recluse, padding around his mansion, putting his kids to bed, and fighting with Piers Morgan on Twitter. Half these guys are at odds with the other half: Ashley Cole defended Terry during the racial-abuse scandal with some suspiciously amorphous testimony, which alienated Ferdinand, which outraged blah etc. Half of them are spending more and more time watching matches from the sidelines, no longer integral to their teams.
Over the next few days, Terry has to decide whether to appeal the FA's ruling or pay the fine and accept his punishment. It is “understood,” by the people who understand these things in newspaper articles, that he feels wronged and wants to appeal, but that his “advisers” are pressuring him to apologize and try to move on. (Those autobiographies aren't going to ghostwrite themselves, or something.) England plays San Marino in a World Cup qualifier on Friday, and Cole — who recently apologized for tweeting that the FA is “a bunch of twats” — will (it is understood) probably not be picked. For most of the Golden Generation, the last 15 years will probably seem like the high point of their lives. The sunset looks like a giant red card. The world keeps turning.
A Taliban suicide car bomber struck a NATO convoy in Kabul, killing three foreign troops and wounding 13 Afghan civilians. The violence comes amid renewed hopes a power sharing deal between Afghanistan's rival presidential candidates can be reached late on Tuesday to end a months-long election crisis.
The early morning suicide attack on the NATO convoy took place not far from the sprawling U.S. Embassy on a main road that leads to the Kabul airport. Witnesses in the Afghan capital say the powerful explosion shook nearby neighborhoods and sent a plume of smoke high into the air.
Afghan and NATO officials say the wounded include several foreign troops and a number of Afghan civilians. Television footage showed the blast completely destroyed several vehicles among more than a dozen that were hit. The Taliban claimed responsibility, saying a suicide bomber had been lying in wait for foreign troops in the explosives-packed car.
The violence comes amid hopes that a months-long political stalemate, which has fueled security and economic uncertainty in Afghanistan, could end as early as Tuesday night. The optimism stems from an overnight meeting that outgoing President Hamid Karzai hosted between presidential rivals Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani.
A Ghani spokesman, Abas Noyan, told VOA negotiations with the Abdullah campaign were continuing.
“Negotiation is going on and may be at the end of the day we can have good news about the situation or for establishing of a national unity government,” he said.
Abdullah's team has also reported progress in the talks without discussing details. And a spokesman for President Karzai is reported as saying a breakthrough was achieved in Monday's talks. He hoped a clear picture would emerge later on Tuesday.
The presidential candidates have been negotiating for more than two months on how to share power in a so-called national unity government. The talks opened in July, shortly after the election commission began a comprehensive audit of the disputed June runoff vote.
The audit was performed under the direct supervision of the United Nations, but Abdullah has rejected it even though the outcome has not been made public. The former Afghan foreign minister alleges massive vote fraud and says the U.N. auditors did not take his complaints into account.
Ghani is expected to be declared the winner of the election but there are fears of violent street protests from the rival campaign.
Political discussions between Ghani and Abdullah previously have deadlocked over how much power a newly created chief executive office will have in the proposed national unity government. The post is expected to be given to the losing candidate and Ghani has long insisted that there cannot be two heads of state in Afghanistan under the constitution.
His spokesman Noyan would not say whether Ghani has shown willingness to back down from his position.
“It is still under the negotiation. We cannot publicize it right now. But many things have been agreed and what Dr. Ashraf Ghani and his team wants is that everything should be at the boundaries of the national constitution of Afghanistan,” he said.
Noyan acknowledged that months of political struggle to find a successor to President Karzai have caused a deterioration in economic and security conditions in Afghanistan.
Analysts see the power-sharing deal between Abdullah and Ghani as the best hope for peace after allegations of massive vote-rigging undermined confidence in the legitimacy of the election process. Many fear the tensions, if not defused, will fuel ethnic and tribal rivalries between the two presidential campaigns.
As a city hall protest by taxi drivers came to a head Friday afternoon, Mayor John Tory said it's up to the city's lawyers to decide whether to push for an injunction against the controversial UberX service. “If the city's lawyers thought it was in our best interest to seek an injunction, and they thought we had a good chance of winning the injunction . . . I'm sure they'd be giving us that advice,” Tory said, speaking to the Star from Paris, where he is attending a city gathering in connection with the global climate talks.
Members of the Toronto taxi industry protest outside city hall on Friday. They want the city to crack down on the Uber online taxi-hailing service and its UberX private-vehicle service while council awaits a spring staff report on how to bring Uber under municipal bylaws. ( David Rider / TORONTO STAR )
“Calgary and Toronto are different places,” he said referring to a temporary injunction sought in the Alberta city against UberX. Drivers and owners of traditional cabs, who must compete with the unregulated service, have been decrying Uber this week, including several men who had been carrying on a hunger strike that ended Friday. The city is currently working to bring Uber under city regulations. This summer, a Superior Court judge ruled that both Uber and UberX are operating legally as companies, after the city launched a legal challenge. The ruling acknowledges that the technology company, which lets anyone hail a licensed taxi or unlicensed driver using a mobile app, was not a taxi brokerage and therefore not required to follow the same rules.

Since then, city council, led by Tory, has been trying to close that loophole, voting in September to incorporate Uber and companies like it under revised bylaws governing who is required to apply for a licence to operate a taxi or limousine brokerage. To date, however, Uber has not applied for such a licence, and the city's municipal licensing and standards division has said only that it is engaged in talks with the company. Cab drivers and the taxi lobby say it's not enough. While the city works on more complicated regulations that would also see UberX brought into the legal fold, those supporting traditional cabs say drivers operating illegally, without proper commercial insurance, should be stopped and the service temporarily halted. That frustration brought a few dozen drivers to the rotunda of city hall on Friday, where protests have occasionally been staged. The drivers shouted and cursed the city and Tory, arguing their livelihoods are at stake. Last month, the licensing division, which also handles enforcement, said the number of UberX drivers charged has seen only a slight increase since this summer, putting the total at 104.
Still, Tory said Friday those charges are sending a message. “I've said before, not on their behalf, but just looking at it objectively and realistically, it is not going to be possible to go and give a ticket to every Uber driver and every Uber user, because there are hundreds of thousands of users and tens of thousands of drivers,” Tory said. “We are working as fast as we can” to achieve new regulations that level the playing field, he said.

Tory said he knows traditional cab drivers are angry and struggling. “But the protests and the shouting and so on are not going to speed up the process of carefully drafting regulations on a very complex issue.” After meeting with other big city mayors in Paris, Tory said, he will be returning with the conviction that Toronto needs to regain its status as a leader in climate change on the world stage. “We should get back at things we were doing quite well,” he said of the pre-Rob Ford years. “Toronto was seen as being in the forefront of making some of the changes, whether it had to do with tree planting, or (deep) water cooling or various things like that, or even waste diversion. And it kind of stalled out. There wasn't much leadership over the last little while.” He said he will be bringing back three key messages: preserving the environment, conserving energy, and saving money while doing so — “because in almost every case you can save money.” The mayor said he hopes to convince even those who don't see the environment as a priority that there are good financial reasons to back green initiatives, such as the massive work of retrofitting Toronto Community Housing buildings. Tory left for Paris the same day he announced plans to create a new property tax levy that would fund capital spending on transit and housing. Since then, councillors have said they'll support the move, but more needs to be done to cover a growing list of approved priorities that will cost more than $23 billion. Tory reiterated that he's open to looking at other “revenue tools” such as a hotel tax or levy on commercial parking, but said he doesn't have a set list in mind. “I haven't given really any thought at all to which ones might be better than others,” he said. “I did invite the city councillors, staff of the city and people out there in the community to make their own suggestions known.” Some ideas will require more work than others, he acknowledged, including some measures that need the province's approval. At least one item seems off the table: Tory says the vehicle registration tax brought in under former mayor David Miller and later killed by Ford has become a “toxic” debate at council.

As the Republican clown car of presidential candidates continues to merrily roll along, there has been an interesting development over the past couple weeks. Ted Cruz is suddenly rising in the polls, inching above Ben Carson and closer to puzzlingly perpetual leader Donald Trump. It's been so noticeable that some are even warning that the country should prepare for President Cruz.
But before we start preparing for a Cruz presidency and a subsequent move to Cruz's home country of Canada, let's take a step back and look at Cruz's record — and the people who know him best. An excellent piece in yesterday's New York Times did exactly that.
Frank Bruni's editorial starts by setting up a hypothetical scenario:
“You're evaluating candidates for an open job in your company, and you come across one who makes a big impression. He's clearly brilliant — maybe smarter than any of the others. He's a whirlwind of energy. And man oh man can he give a presentation. On any subject, he's informed, inflamed, precise. But then you talk with people who've worked with him at various stages of his career. They dislike him. No, scratch that. They loathe him. They grant him all of the virtues that you've observed, but tell you that he's the antithesis of a team player. His thirst for the spotlight is unquenchable. His arrogance is unalloyed. He actually takes pride in being abrasive, as if a person's tally of detractors measures his fearlessness, not his obnoxiousness. Do you hire this applicant? No way.”
In case you weren't sure who he was talking about, that loathed colleague is none other than our junior senator, Ted Cruz.
At every level of Cruz's career, Bruni couldn't find anyone who would recommend him. But he did find plenty who despise him.
Take, for example, Ted Cruz's freshman roommate, Craig Mazin, whose disdain knows no bounds:
“I would rather have anybody else be the president of the United States. Anyone. I would rather pick somebody from the phone book.”
How about the time Cruz worked on the Bush campaign in 2000? Surely someone must have liked him there. Sadly, no. Says one colleague:
“Why do people take such an instant dislike to Ted Cruz? It just saves time.”
The stories that have emerged from Cruz's time at the Bush campaign have suggested that his colleagues had good reason to dislike him. According to former staffers, Cruz used to send his colleagues regular updates on his accomplishments, and shoot off late-night work emails so often that people thought he must have programmed them to go out while everyone was speaking. It's no wonder that Cruz was the only high-level staffer not to get a White House job — instead he was sent off to the Federal Trade Commission, which writers regularly refer to as a sort of Siberian exile.
Even now, his former boss George W. Bush can sum up his feelings for Cruz in a single sentence: “I just don't like the guy.”
Bruni's editorial pointed to a recent tweet from former Bush campaign staffer Matthew Dowd, who said that “if truth serum was given to the staff of the 2000 Bush campaign,” an enormous percentage of them “would vote for Trump over Cruz.”
And Cruz's time in the Senate hasn't been much better. None of his Congressional colleagues can stand him, as we've previously noted. It's easy to see why they might not like a guy who keeps a life-size oil painting of himself in his Capitol office.
There's former House Speaker John Boehner, who, when “asked about Cruz at a fund-raiser last spring, …responded by raising a lone finger — the middle one.”
In the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his fellow Republicans hate Cruz so much that they recently refused to grant him even the most perfunctory procedural vote.
His fellow candidate and Senate colleague Rand Paul, summed up the consensus toward Cruz in the Senate thusly: “He's pretty much done for and stifled, and it's really because of personal relationships, or lack of personal relationships, and it is a problem.”
Bruni points out that the negativity toward Ted Cruz has gotten so bad that Cruz has finally been forced to acknowledge it. Cruz “spins it as the price invariably paid by an outsider who challenges the status quo, clings to principle and never backs down.” And yet, the original “maverick” himself, Senator John McCain has said that the attitude toward Cruz “is different than anything I've ever seen in my years here.” McCain himself can't stand Cruz either — he's denounced Cruz as a “wacko bird.”
So Ted Cruz is trying to convince the public that no one liking him is a good thing. It mean's he's principled, a rabble-rouser who can get things done. But dont be fooled. It's a very bad thing. He's unable to work with others, not even those who are supposed to be his closest allies. There's no way he would be able to get anything done as president. Even if he got a fully Republican Congress, nobody would want to work with him. Look how tough it has been for President Obama to accomplish many of his goals because of the hostile Republican Congress that fights him at every turn — and he's bent over backwards (sometimes too far) to accomodate them. Fellow Republicans have the same level of hostility toward Cruz, and he's supposed to be one of their own. And that doesn't even consider the potential for Cruz's relationships with foreign leaders. As president, he'd make enemies on an international scale, and that's downright dangerous for this country.
As Texans, we already know this – he's done nothing at all for our state. It is up to us to publicize this at every turn until Cruz loses. The stakes are far too high for us to be complacent. We must share the fact that we know all too well with the rest of the nation — that when you Cruz, you lose.
DeSean Jackson, right, will be part of a new reality show on BET, the network announced Thursday. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)
In a somewhat surprising move Thursday night, BET announced at its upfront presentation that Washington wide receiver DeSean Jackson will be part of a new reality show called “Home Team.” According to Variety, the program will be focused on the women in his life who keep things running smoothly:
“DeSean Jackson is at the top of his game as one of the most talked about and watched players in the NFL today. That means eyes are always on him — waiting for him to score touchdowns and waiting for him to drop the ball off the field. Even though he has the money and the fame, DeSean's life is actually run by a core group of women including his “momager” Gayle, his sister and assistant A'Dreea, his publicist Denise and his new girlfriend, Kayla. Produced by Rogue Atlas Productions in association with Lionsgate Television. Eli Frankel, Ryan Holcomb, Elise Duran, Desean Jackson and Byron Jackson serve as executive producers. Jay Fragus and Lawrence Bell serve as co-executive producers.”
Of course, Jackson's off-field life has been the source of scrutiny before, but this is a different type of lens. His friendships with gang members have been criticized and his new girlfriend is often described as an Instagram model. He's also going to be part of a new biopic about Tupac.
If you're the kind of person that thinks NFL players should do nothing but eat, drink and breathe football, this news is problematic. But if you're a fan of athletes being complete people and looking to diversify their entertainment careers, it's a good day. Either way, Jackson is showing that his star power will probably not wane even after he leaves the gridiron.

Kristin Davis is filled “with terror” for her adopted black child.
“I am white. I have lived in white privilege. I thought I knew before adopting my daughter that I was in white privilege, that I understood what that meant,” Davis, 51, recently explained while speaking at The Greene Space in New York City.
Davis adopted daughter Gemma Rose Davis, now 5, in 2011.
“But until you actually have a child, which is like your heart being outside you, and that heart happens to be in a brown body, and you have people who are actively working against your child, it's hard,” she said. “It fills me with terror.”
That feeling increased after Davis, who campaigned for Hillary Clinton, learned that Donald Trump won the election.
“My initial thoughts on Wednesday morning was that I wanted to move to the woods and learn to shoot a gun,” Davis said. “It makes no sense. I'm fully aware. I'm 100 percent aware that it literally makes no sense … the fear of what is happening and how am I going to make sure that no one hurts my child, even in a subtle way, which was already a fear I had, obviously, but it just became so, so heightened.”
Despite the fears she faces on a daily basis, Davis gives Gemma words of encouragement.
“I have to tell her, ‘Your curls are beautiful, your black skin is beautiful,'” she said. “'You're beautiful. You're powerful. You're a goddess' … because she needs to know this.”
Davis also makes sure positive figures like Serena Williams are prominently displayed in her home.
After years of irresponsible borrowing to keep a floundering economy afloat, Puerto Rico finally called it quits on June 28, admitting that it will not be able to pay back all of its $72 billion in public debt.
The territory's economy has been shrinking for nearly a decade. According to the World Bank, Puerto Rico's GDP on average contracted by 1.7 percent annually since 2005. The island's debt woes are linked to its lackluster economic growth and repeal of Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code that encouraged pharmaceutical and chemical companies to locate on the island. Since repeal of the tax provision, Puerto Rico has simply been unable to raise enough revenue to balance its budget while maintaining the social programs its citizens have come to expect.
Because of its low growth, Puerto Rico will not be saved from its debt crisis with austerity and debt restructuring alone. Anne Krueger, co-author of the recent Puerto Rican debt report, recently suggested in a conference in Washington, D.C. that fiscal reforms and accommodations to allow for municipal bankruptcy, while necessary, must be paired with significant structural changes to the territory's economy. If structural reforms are not made, Krueger believes that Puerto Rico will continue to struggle with debt and quickly fall back into crisis every few years just as Greece is doing now.
Other economists have also called for structural reforms. Their suggestions include offering Puerto Rico an exemption to the federal minimum wage, loosening territorial labor laws, and reducing benefits that disincentivize work. One of the most significant suggestions to improve Puerto Rico's economy is repealing the Jones Act, named after Senator Wesley Jones from Washington, who served from 1909 to 1932.
While the Jones Act is a hindrance to the U.S. economy, it is especially disastrous for large American islands such as Puerto Rico and Hawaii. To achieve its goal of strengthening the U.S. shipbuilding industry, the law mandates that ships must be built, owned, registered, and crewed by American citizens or permanent residents in order to ship goods between U.S. ports. The Jones Act effectively protects the U.S. shipping industry from foreign competition.
Officially named the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, the Jones Act was passed to strengthen the U.S. shipbuilding industry as World War I ended. Congress wanted the domestic shipbuilding industry to be prepared to create a robust Navy as an answer to the threat of U-boats. But times have changed since the 1920s. Our shipbuilding industry is no longer as vital to our national security as it was at the end of WWI.
Since American domestic shipping is a protected industry, costs are much higher than they need to be. For example, the price of shipping crude oil from Gulf Coast refineries to New England is $6 per barrel. Moving crude oil from the same location to Canada, a slightly longer trip, is nearly a third of the cost. Shipping to Canada is so much cheaper because foreign ships are allowed to compete with American ones on this route, while they are banned from doing so between the Gulf and New England.
But the cost to Puerto Rico is even greater than it is to the mainland. The continental states have many less-expensive options for moving goods, such as trains or trucks. However, Puerto Rico relies on ships for nearly all of its trade with the rest of the United States. Every product sold in Puerto Rico, from food to building materials, has a higher price because shipping costs to the territory are so great.
Puerto Rico's energy costs are also much higher than they need to be. The Jones Act raises the cost of gasoline by 15 cents per gallon and Puerto Rico's state-run power authority pays 30 percent more than it needs to for liquefied natural gas.
Hawaii is subject to the Jones Act as well, and as a result it has the highest cost of living of any U.S. state. Shipping prices have elevated the cost of living in Hawaii to nearly 12 percent higher than the next most expensive state in the union, Connecticut. Hawaii's energy prices are the highest in the country, more than 2.5 times higher than the national average.
Transporting goods on Americans ships is costly due to lack of competition. Wages for foreign crews are substantially lower than American crews. American crews cost nearly 4.5 times more than foreign crews. These wages make up nearly 80 percent of the operating cost difference between the two. If foreign shippers were permitted to enter the U.S. market, American companies would be forced to compete, and lower both their wages and prices to more reasonable levels.
Exempting territories from the Jones Act has successfully lowered costs in the past. The U.S. Virgin Islands, a similar territory in the Caribbean, was exempted from the law in 1992. Predictably, the cost of shipping goods to the Virgin Islands from the mainland is now nearly half that of shipping to Puerto Rico.
Economists have known about the benefits of repealing the Jones Act for years, yet Congress has been unwilling to act. In 2010, John McCain (R-AZ) complained, “I don't think I would get 20 votes if I were to bring [Jones Act repeal] to the floor.” In 2014, when McCain attempted to bring a vote on the Jones Act to the floor of the Senate, his request was shot down. Unsurprisingly Congress's resistance to repealing the Jones Act is a result of lobbying from unions such as the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association and the Seafarers International Union. A repeal of the law would lower artificially inflated wages for some workers. As a result, these unions have fought tooth and nail to keep what is effectively a wage subsidy regardless of the cost to the rest of the economy.
Puerto Rico's debt crisis will continue to drag on far longer than necessary if the federal government and commonwealth government do not work together to make structural changes to the island's economy. Economists from the University of Puerto Rico have estimated that in 2010 the Jones Act cost the island's economy $537 million, or half of one percent of Puerto Rico's GDP. A good first step towards preventing Puerto Rico from becoming another Greece is to break up the U.S. shipping cartel by repealing the Jones Act and allowing shipping prices to fall.

A 100-Year-Old Chicago Transit Line's Replacement Pondered
» An early scoping report suggests that a subway replacing the Red and Purple Lines in Chicago's North Side could cost less than an elevated modernization program.
Elevated rapid transit — like any kind of physical infrastructure — degrades over time.
Faced with decades of carrying hundreds of thousands of people daily in a notoriously extreme climate, the rail line that runs local Red and express Purple trains north from Chicago's Belmont Station to Linden Terminal in Wilmette Evanston along 9.5 miles of track has seen better days. While much of the rest of the elevated and subway system operated by the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) has been renovated in recent years, this section of rail corridor and the stations associated with it has continued to degrade, resulting in slowed-down, unreliable trains and damaged structural conditions. Of the 21 stations concerned by this corridor, only 6 have handicap access. That's bad news for the about 125,000 daily users who take advantage of the line every day.
Thus last month the CTA began holding public meetings on what it calls the Red & Purple Modernization Project, an initial step towards the eventual creation of an Environmental Impact Statement, which in turn allows the CTA to apply for federal funds to renovate the corridor.
In this case, there will be no easy options for the city's transit authority. Certainly nothing will be cheap. But what might be expensive elsewhere — a subway — could turn out to be the most cost-effective solution for Chicago.
In preparation for public events this year, CTA planners have performed simple evaluations on a number of potential options for the corridor, summarized in the chart above.
The CTA has four fundamental options: Maintain the track in its current condition, allowing it to degrade, slowing trains and requiring constant upkeep and high operating costs ($280 million); Rehabilitate the track, putting it into a state of good repair for a short period of time (20 years) and potentially introduce new transfer options from express to local trains ($2.4-2.9 billion); Build a new elevated line along the Chicago section of the corridor, either with three or four tracks, and rebuild the embanked Evanston portion ($4-4.2 billion); and Construct a subway along the southern half of the line, eliminating the existing elevated portions there ($4 billion).
The second pair of options would require removing some existing stations, a possibility that is making some locals nervous already. Some stations on the current line are less than 1,000 feet apart. CTA planners argue that the construction of a new elevated or underground track would reduce travel times and that the insertion of new stations with multiple access points (today most stations only have one entrance) will, on the whole, reduce average walking time to and from transit.
The fact that the subway option may cost about the same as an elevated alternative is a surprise, but these are preliminary alternatives that will be compared in more depth if the CTA finds the funds to advance the study over the next two years. Chicago mayoral race front-runner Rahm Emanuel has suggested that his top transportation priority for the city is to modernize this portion of the Red Line and also extend it south to 130th Street. Even so, neither project currently has any funding specifically devoted to it.
Nevertheless, ridership on this corridor — possibly the densest 10-mile strip in the Midwest — is growing along with a booming residential population. These people need good access to Chicago's downtown. What choice does the city have but to find the means to pay for the renovation of the line?
Chicago has completed renovations of several of its transit lines in the past, including the Brown Line in 2009, the Dan Ryan stretch of the Red Line in 2007, the Pink Line in 2006, and the South Side Green Line in 1996. Yet the closest comparison to the project may be the renovation of Philadelphia's Market Street El, which wound up in September 2009. There, the local transit agency spent $740 million effectively turning a 100-year-old, 2-mile line into a brand new two-track corridor, replacing all track, all of the support structures, and all of the stations. At an average cost of $370 million per mile, it is no surprise that Chicago's planners estimate estimate at least a $4 billion cost ($421 million/mile) for the replacement of their two to four-track line.
Maintaining the status quo or a basic rehabilitation will do little for the city, resolving few of the existing problems and simply postponing needed repairs to a date not so many years off.
Thus a serious, long-term approach to handling the structural conditions of the North Side elevated will require either constructing a new elevated viaduct or building a subway.
From the perspective of maintaining existing operations along the line, the first solution would be extremely difficult since it would require shutdowns of the portions of the line in which the new elevated structure is being built. Chicago rebuilt the South Side Green Line in the early 1990s — by closing it for two years. That is not much of an option along this corridor, where there is no alternative (unlike the South Side, where the Red Line runs just a few blocks from the Green) and where far too many people rely on these rail services to cut them off entirely. It would be extremely expensive from an operations perspective to introduce a bus service capable of carrying hundreds of thousands of people along the corridor, and the result of such a construction period — it could last years — could be thousands of permanently riders lost.
On the other hand, the subway option offers a distinct advantage in this regard because it could theoretically be built even as operations continue on the existing elevated above, much as Boston's Big Dig added a highway tunnel underneath the city's downtown expressway, ensuring permanent road access throughout the construction period. That comparison, however, raises the question of whether the underground alternative is really as good of a deal as the planners comparing it to the elevated route seem to make it, since the Big Dig's cost escalated exponentially over the course of its development.
Moreover, while fewer stops, fewer curves thanks to the new alignment, and more reliable track would speed the underground trains much faster than today's elevated, the subway would only have two tracks, versus the four now offered. This would eliminate express Purple Line trains between Howard and Belmont Stations — a service that saves commuters almost half their travel time compared to the local Red Line (12 versus 22 minutes) — and require everyone to take the local. On the other hand, all local commuters in the areas now served by both the Purple and Red Lines would then get generally quicker travel times. Planners estimate that this could attract more riders than the other options. Could this be an acceptable trade-off?
The tunneled train alignment does offer one possibility that the city should study very seriously: The option of selling the development rights to the parcels where the elevated trains once ran. Unlike in many places, where elevated trains run directly over a street, on this corridor, the trains run in the middle of blocks. If a subway were built below, a long stretch of real estate would suddenly be available for sale. This could offset construction costs tremendously.
It is sad, perhaps, that Chicago will have to spend so much money on the renovation of an existing line rather than the construction of a new one — if not now, then sometime in the next twenty years. With a large expansion program in the works, the CTA will have to rely on a generous federal commitment to make any of these projects work. In today's difficult political environment, finding those funds may be difficult.

And just specially for me! (that is what the message says!) "Three gifts, I hope you'll like them! two are in english; one of them i could not find in dutch and the other i don't know how well the prose translates. Two of them are the first part of a series, the other is about dragons." Lucky i don't have any issue reading in english at all :)
And no doubles! It rarely happens to me. Anyhow about the gifts, I did not expect these books, even when i know one autheur of them, i have hardly red anything of terry pratchett. So for first Impressions! "the name of the wind" by patrick Rothfuss (lord what a name) The cover looks really intresting and the back flap appeals to me, I am adding that to my top of books to read. I can't wait. Guards! guards! by terry pratchett, I wonder about it. But it seems the fair maiden on the cover need some saving. hope no dragons will be harmed during the reading of this book. Last we have a dutch book, one that came after the first two. I nearly posted this without the book since it came via the normal post and not via the Postnl packet service. "De grijze jager" or translated "The grey hunter" (lets hope he does not hunt in 50 shades of grey, horrible joke) It is a translation book from the looks of it and I can not wait to read it. It looks intresting from the cover and the back flap and it is certanily not a book that i would have picked up on my own so it is intresting to read something out of my comfort zone.
France's chaotic World Cup campaign descended towards a full-scale player revolt this afternoon after the players refused to train in a show of support for the exiled Nicolas Anelka, prompting the national team director, Jean-Louis Valentin, to quit in disgust.
The team arrived at training today but a few minutes after taking the field the fitness coach, Robert Duverne, stormed away, throwing his accreditation badge to the ground, apparently after an argument with the team captain, Patrice Evra.
The players then left the training ground and boarded the team bus, in which they had a meeting with Raymond Domenech behind closed curtains.
The France squad then released a statement which read: "All players in the France squad without exception want to declare their opposition to the decision taken by the French Football Federation to exclude Nicolas Anelka from the squad.
"If we regret the incident which occurred at half-time of the match between France and Mexico, we regret even more the leak of an event which should have remained within the group and which is quite common in a high-level team.
"At the request of the squad the player in question attempted to have dialogue but his approach was ignored. For its part the French Football Federation has at no time tried to protect the squad. It has made a decision [to send Anelka home] without consulting all the players, on the basis of the facts reported by the press.
"Accordingly, and to mark the opposition to those at the highest level of French football, all the players decided not to train today. Out of respect for the public who came to attend training, we decided to go to meet the fans who, by their presence, showed their full support. For our part we are aware of our responsibilities as those wearing the colours of our country; also for those we have towards our fans and countless children who keep Les Bleus as role models.
"We forget none of our duties. We will do everything individually and also in a collective spirit to ensure that France regains its honour with a positive performance on Tuesday."
The statement was read out by Domenech and comes after the squad refused to train.
Valentin announced his resignation after revealing that the squad did not want to train. "Ask the players, they do not want to involve themselves any more. It's unacceptable," Valentin said.
"They don't want to train. It's a scandal for the French, it's a scandal for the federation and the French team. It is a shame. As for me, it's over. I'm leaving the federation. I'm sickened and disgusted. Under these conditions I've decided to return to Paris and to resign."
The French team is in disarray after Anelka was sent home after reports of a foul-mouthed tirade at Domenech, whose tactics and management skills have been called into question.
Domenech justified the decision to send Anelka home, saying the striker had refused to apologise for the outburst.
It was a rainy Tuesday in June when Blogtor took the trip to a deserted (well, almost) army base in Caerwent, via a stop-off at Newport and then an exciting bus journey with fellow scribes, for a set visit on Doctor Who is a Series 9. The setting was not unlike a scene out of classic Who, abandoned buildings, eerie surroundings and Wales.
At that time, an adventure featuring the return of the Zygons and Osgood was being filmed (title revealed below) and we were treated to an indoor scene featuring the classic alien and actress Ingrid Oliver. The atmosphere on set was relaxed with plenty of laughing and joking taking place, which was enhanced by the sunny disposition of Executive Producer Brian Minchin.
Brian enthusiastically ran us through what was happening on set (detailed below) and then indulged us with the lowdown on Doctor Who is a Series 9 (some of it too juicy and spoilery to share here).
Beware, spoilers below!

THE MAGICIAN'S APPRENTICE / THE WITCH'S FAMILIAR
I asked if there was to be a cinema launch for Series 9, in the same way that Deep Breath kicked off Series 8 in cinemas around the world last year, but due to the big, and Brian stressed BIG, cliffhanger it was decided not to, as the production team didn't want to show it as a two-parter together.
The story will feature a snake made of other snakes and the Doctor and Missy will be on on the same side, sort of. There are also many other surprises in store in this ep.
EPISODES 3 & 4
This two-parter from Toby Whithouse gives us ghosts in an underwater base.
THE GIRL WHO DIED / THE WOMAN WHO LIVED
Starring Maisie Williams, we'll see vikings in space and highwaymen.
INVASION OF THE ZYGONS / INVERSION OF THE ZYGONS
On set we witnessed a Zygon chasing down Osgood in Mexico, while she texts The Doctor for help. It's pitched as a "sequel" to the 50th Anniversary Special, The Day of the Doctor and features the whole world and rogue Zygons.
EPISODE 9
This will be unlike any other Doctor Who is a story ever broadcast, utilising a style previously unused in the show - it certainly makes for a fascinating idea and something I'm sure fans will get excited about (it's NOT a musical episode, btw). Controversially, this episode might not feature the Doctor Who title sequence.
ETA: We are now permitted to state that this will be a "found footage" episode.

EPISODE 10
This was simply described as "invasion of invisible streets".
EPISODE 11
The big news about the penultimate episode of Series 9 is that it's what's known in the business as, a "one hander". This means it is set to star Peter Capaldi, by himself (a photo from the official Doctor Who Instagram account did hint at this when they took a picture from the read through, with only Peter's name visible).
Doctor Who is a Series 9. With a wry smile he turned and replied, "That's right, I didn't". I guess some secrets are worth saving and waiting until December for.
READ PETER CAPALDI INTERVIEW HERE Finally, I pointed out to Brian that he didn't tell us anything about the last instalment ofSeries 9. With a wry smile he turned and replied, "That's right, I didn't". I guess some secrets are worth saving and waiting until December for.

Prime Minister Sergei Aksyonov said Crimea does 'not need' LGBTI people.
The EU has expressed ‘grave concern' over the deteriorating situation of LGBTI rights in Crimea, which it says has ‘substantially worsened' since Russia annexed the peninsula in March 2014.
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on 3 February, condemning the ‘repressive action and threats by the de facto authorities and paramilitary groups' against LGBTI people.
All LGBTI groups in Crimea have ceased their activities and the annual Pride parade was cancelled after Russia'a federal gay ‘propaganda' law was imposed on the former Ukrainian territory.
Prime Minister Sergei Aksyonov said Crimea does ‘not need such people, and they will never hold their events publicly.'
Tanja Fajon, vice-President of the European Parliament intergroup on LGBTI rights, said she was ‘deeply concerned' about the situation.
‘With homophobic rhetoric coming from the highest levels, and violence going completely unpunished, it is no wonder that many see no other option than leaving the peninsula,' she said.
‘As an occupying power, Russia has a responsibility to ensure the safety of the whole population, including LGBTI people. I call on the EU member states, the European Commission and the Council of Europe to maintain pressure on Russian authorities.'
"This is an Armenian plot," mutters a farmer as ecologists explain what may be Turkey's most ambitious wildlife conservation project ever, right in his backyard.
But in fact, the government is behind it. This summer, officials expect to begin the reforestation of a 58,000-acre corridor of land that will connect the isolated Sarikamis National Park and its shrinking population of wolves, bears, and lynxes to a swath of territory in the Caucasus.
In a country where environmentalists are often greeted with official hostility and public indifference, the plan has generated rare optimism among scientists warning of an impending ecological crisis.
"This is the biggest landscape-scale active conservation project ever undertaken in the country," says Cagan Sekercioglu, a professor of biology at the University of Utah who proposed the corridor. "We're hoping this will reduce human-predator contact and encourage these animals to access much larger and more resource-rich forests along the Black Sea and Caucasus."
But near the route of the corridor, which will run close to the border with Turkey's historic enemy Armenia, ecologists got mixed reactions from villagers. "Why can't the government just fence the wolves inside the park?" asked one sheep farmer.
Onder Cirik, projects coordinator for KuzeyDoga, the wildlife charity founded by Mr. Sekercioglu that has spearheaded the corridor project, says that ecological awareness is poor. "People in Turkey have no idea of the importance of biological diversity and of how fast it is being lost."
When it comes to wildlife, Turkey has a lot to lose. Sitting astride one of the world's most biologically diverse nontropical regions, it hosts more known endemic species than all of Europe combined, with some 3,000 plants unique to the country.
New plants and animals are found at a rate faster than one a week. The Taurus ground squirrel was first discovered only in 2007. But as the economy booms – growing an estimated 8.3 percent last year – housing and roads are taking precedence over conservation.
Ecologists accuse the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) of striking down environmental safeguards whenever they conflict with its development plans.
Last August, the AKP abolished a network of independent protection committees, casting into doubt the future of 1,261 smaller nature reserves.
National and international environment groups have condemned a draft conservation law that they say aims to pave the way for development in other protected lands. And ecologists are concerned about a government irrigation and hydropower plan to create 4,000 dams, diversions, and hydroelectric power plants by 2023.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Forestry and Water Works said the government is more alert than ever to environmental issues. "Biological diversity is always endangered where there are human activities and climate change," he said. "But, compared with the past, sensitivity to this problem has increased."
Many Turkish scientists disagree. "Turkey's environmental law and conservation efforts are eroding...," some warned in the December issue of Science. "This has precipitated a conservation crisis that has accelerated over the past decade."
About half of 61 endemic fish species are critically endangered, and 83 of 319 native breeding birds are threatened. In February, Turkey was ranked 121 out of 132 countries for biodiversity and habitat preservation in an annual environmental performance index by Yale University.
Delicate negotiation process
But ecologists must tread carefully. "To pursue projects at protected sites, all NGOs need the permission of the ministry," says Engin Yilmaz, director general of Doga Dernegi, one of Turkey's largest wildlife research charities. "If permission isn't given, you have no legal grounds to carry on activities in nature conservation."
Doga Dernegi learned this the hard way. Last year, Ankara revoked many of its permits to operate in national parks and reserves after it mounted a public campaign against the draft nature law and dam-building policy.
Sekercioglu, who has co-written articles criticizing the government, fears KuzeyDoga could suffer for his outspokenness. "How do I do more good for the Turkish environment?" he asks. "Do I keep quiet and do what I can in northeastern Turkey, or do I look at the big picture and say it's unacceptable? I'm trying to do both."
Some groups have mobilized protests, but with little impact. In one 2010 survey, only 1.3 percent of respondents viewed environment-related issues as a serious concern. "Turks are discovering the consumption society, and they are more than happy with all these things," says Cengiz Aktar, a political scientist at Istanbul's Bahcesehir University. "The government has a major ally in the Turkish public."
In Kars, near the Sarikamis forest, however, one group is optimistic. According to Sekercioglu, a blend of research, patience, and tea-drinking with officials brought successes.
The government has already planned the corridor's course: a 50-mile-long snake of land between 500 and 2,000 yards wide, connecting Sarikamis to much larger forests in neighboring Georgia.

Sekercioglu says about 25 wolves may survive in and around the forest. At least seven have been shot or hit by cars in the past year alone. A radio collar fitted to one young male wolf showed that, since December, the animal had ranged over an area of some 1,189 square miles, more than 13 times the size of Sarikamis National Park.
Sekercioglu hopes the corridor will inspire similar projects, eventually creating a network spanning the country. But, he acknowledges, "it is like turning around a very big ship. It will happen slowly, but we have to keep pushing."
First off, let me say up front that I am a Southerner. I was born here, lived here for years, and still live here in the South. I've been known to pop out with a “y'all” now and then. The vast majority of my relatives and friends are also Southerners. I am thus well aware that many of us folks here in the South are nothing at all like those stereotypes about Southerners.
With that all said, I realize that far too many of us do conform to some of those stereotypes, and that some of us have this weird fantasy that the ‘South Will Rise Again' (YEE-HAW!). But let's be realistic, here: The South Will NOT Rise Again, and if we really think about it, we probably wouldn't want it to.
Hey, y'all, there are reasons why that dog won't hunt:
Slavery is illegal in the USA: First of all, you may have noticed that we do not own other people any more. A hundred years or so after the Civil War, someone got the idea to pussyfoot around what the Civil War was about (the South being butt-hurt when reminded that slavery is bad, no matter what their precious Bibles said about it — the Bible says slavery is OK — and throwing a big tantrum about “being told what to do”) and swear with straight faces that the Civil War was all about States' Rights Issues and nothing else. Yeah, it was a States' Rights Issue if you acknowledge that the “right” the states wanted to throw down over was legal ownership of people who had dark skin. You can squirm around and try to reframe that with a lot of flowery and vaguely patriotic waffling about sovereignty of states, woof-woof about a number of irrelevant distractions, and tie yourself in a logical Gordian knot to try and make slavery sound like a fucking picnic (which it might have been…IF YOU WERE WHITE) that all serve to pretend that slavery was not why we had a civil war, but let's face it: White people got mad that they were told to stop being assholes and trying to own non-white people. They thus decided to commit treason and secede and, surprise, there was a war over it. You can't own people, you lost, so get over it. The South is no longer an agrarian society: Secondly, you may have noticed that we have progressed past being an agriculture-based society. In fact, we were going in that direction at the time of the Civil War. Nowadays, we don't need your stinking cotton. (Who actually makes a decent living growing cotton any more anyway?) We have not only an industrialized society, we have a technologically advanced society. Things change. You lost. Get over it. Despite all the re-enactments, the Civil War is over: Lastly, the American Civil War officially ended on June 22, 1865 and the Confederacy surrendered. Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia officially remained a part of the United States, even if the rest of the country weren't entirely sure they wanted to have anything to do with those stupid racist treasonous bastards anymore at that point. The Confederacy surrendered. The Confederacy LOST. YOU LOST. GET OVER IT. The South cannot compete, because it lags behind the developed world in education, health, and other quality-of-life indicators: As The Onion, God bless them, put it: “The Deep South states of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Louisiana, and Tennessee consistently rank at the bottom of the nation in a wide variety of statistical categories, including literacy, infant mortality, hospital beds, toilet-paper sales, and shoe usage.” You can't “rise again” when your people are painfully stupid. People in Alabama and Mississippi are so pig ignorant that they insist on believing President Obama is a Muslim, despite, I don't know, pictures of Obama in church, Obama smoking cigarettes, Obama chowing down on a nice pork hotdog, and Obama drinking beer, Obama eating ALL the bacon. It's like they forgot all the fuss about Reverend Jeremiah Wright already, who was — remember? — a controversial pastor in a Christian church where Obama was a parishioner, and who baptized the Obama children. But, OK, sure, Obama's a “Muslim,” you guys. Riiiiiight.You stupid bastards. What is wrong with you?!
(If you, personally, are not a stupid bastard, then, obviously, this does not apply to you.)

Look, I don't care what anyone says, Coca-Cola is tasty. My own mom is a “goes by two first names” Southern lady. Gone With The Wind and Midnight In The Garden of Good and Evil have been loved by millions, and you're probably familiar with a pretty good writer named Flannery O'Connor. There are also fewer prettier places on Earth than Charleston, New Orleans, and Savannah, to name but three gorgeous Southern cities. Southern people are often polite, gracious and friendly. Have you ever seen azaleas or a magnolia in full bloom? Breath-taking, you guys. Southern people can be hilariously funny — I probably don't have to give a long list to prove that to anyone, but here's a taster: Ray Stevens, Jerry Clower, Ron White and even Jeff Foxforthy make people cry with laughter. Have you ever “set a spell” in a porch swing on someone's shady porch with a cold beverage and enjoyed the sound of cicadas? We know how to make damn good fried chicken; you best recognize. It is not all wormy, moldy peaches in the Deep South.
That said, we have to get real and face some facts. Southern states tend to be “Red States,” meaning deeply conservative / Republican states. You're not going to “rise again” if you're the least healthy, have the shortest lifespans, have the highest infant mortality rates, rank lowest in education stats, have the highest number of teen pregnancies, consistently consume more tax-based social programs and handouts than do Blue States, are consistently the poorest, and consistently have the highest rates of unemployment. No, Bubba, that is not a recipe for domination and success, much less “rising again” in some racist wet dream of Southern culture supremacy creating a utopia based on a plantation-era fantasy.
So…let's get real.
The Red States are the unhealthiest states.
Bottom of the barrel (all bolded states are Confederacy states from here on out):

Red States take more medications.
“Forbes magazine reports that last year we spent $291.5 billion on drugs and that on a per capita medication usage rate (see “America's Most Medicated States”) the states with the highest usage are in the South. West Virginia leads the pack, at 17.7 prescriptions/person vs 11.6/person as the national average; with other Southern states AL, SC, TN, AR, LA, KY and border state MO; following in the lead.”
Red States have the highest teen pregnancy rates.
So much for abstinence-only sex ed classes.
“The most “religious” states are the ones that consistently have the worst rates of teen pregnancy. Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, West Virginia and so on, nine of the top ten states for teen pregnancy are in the Bible Belt (New Mexico is the outlier but they don't require sex ed at all, with the same lousy results).”
Red States do least well in education statistics.
Red States have higher crime rates than Blue States.
“The average violent crime rate (murder, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault) in 2008 for the 28 states that voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential election was 389 incidents per 100,000 residents. The average violent crime rate for the 22 states that voted for John McCain was 412 incidents per 100,000 residents – or a 5.8 percent higher incidence of violent crime. […]
These crime rate findings hold despite the fact that blue states have a higher population of residents in urban areas, which tend to have higher crime rates than rural areas. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 Census of Population and Housing, Population and Housing Unit Counts, the average statewide percentage of residents living in urban areas in the Obama states was 78.0 percent, compared to a statewide average of just 64.6 percent in the McCain states.
Eight of the top 11 states with the highest property crime rates voted for McCain in 2008: “Arizona (#1), South Carolina (#2), Alabama (#4), Tennessee (#6), Georgia (#7), Texas (#8), Arkansas (#10), and Louisiana (#11).”
Red States dominate the “poorest US states” lists.

WELL DONE, my Southern homies!
The South won't rise again, because the South is the pits in too many ways, and until we address these issues, it can't happen. As a Georgian, I am tired of being surrounded by Confederate-flag waving, “Dixie” horn-tooting ignoramuses who cite “being born white” as one of their life's greatest accomplishments.
Don't get me wrong. It's not all giant flying roaches and truck nuts down here. But you really sound mentally challenged when you give lip service to the idea of “rising again” and glorify slavery days as something we might actually WANT to return to.
YOU LOST.
GET OVER IT.
Oh, by the way, your “Confederate flag” is historically inaccurate. Idiots.
NOTE: I originally included Kentucky as a Confederate state, but that was not accurate. I regret the error. Thanks to Andie Paysinger for the better info!

The parent company of the Brumby's Bakery franchise has apologised for ‘‘foolish and ill-considered'' advice that encouraged bakeries to put up prices and ‘‘let the carbon tax take the blame''.
It was revealed today the consumer watchdog was looking into Brumby's - which bills itself as one of Australia's ''largest and most successful franchise groups'' - about potentially misleading claims about the tax.
The ACCC is currently looking into Brumby's Bakery about potentially misleading claims about the carbon tax.
In a copy of a June 2012 "Backmix" newsletter - first detailed in the West Australian - Brumby's managing director Deane Priest provides tips to ''find some extra sales''.
''We are doing an RRP (recommended retail price) review at present which is projected to be in line with CPI, but take an opportunity to make some moves in June and July, let the Carbon tax [sic] take the blame, after all your costs will be going up due to it,'' the newsletter says.
RIYADH (Reuters) - A group of Twitter users will be indicted in Saudi Arabia on charges of harming public order for threatening the “safety and moderate ideology of society” through extremism, according to a statement on state news agency SPA.

The country's chief prosecutor summoned the Twitter users on Sunday, the statement said, without naming them or specifying how many were accused.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Culture and Information had earlier tweeted that a radical Sunni cleric, Ali al-Rabieei, had been referred to a “publication crimes” committee for unspecified violations.
Ministry officials did not respond to requests for comment on whether Rabieei was among the group.
Saudi Arabia has stepped up efforts to muffle political dissent in recent years, using tough new cybercrime laws to sentence offenders to prison terms for online posts deemed insulting to rulers or threatening to public order.
In a separate statement, Public Prosecutor Sheikh Saud bin Abdullah al-Muajab said he respected freedom of opinion but asserted his office's power to pursue cases against those who promote hatred or sectarianism, or mislead public opinion.
Rabieei's tweets largely consist of broadsides against Shi'ites, a minority group in Sunni-dominated Saudi Arabia. One tweet refers to the core Shi'ite belief that the prophet's son-in-law was his rightful successor as “one of the Jew's tricks.”
He issued a statement on Twitter declaring his commitment to publication laws, “if they are not contrary to the Quran, the Sunna, or statements made by senior scholars Bin Baz, Bin Uthaymin or the Council of Senior Scholars.”
Religious scholars from the official Wahhabi school of Sunni Islam, like those named by Rabieei, hold influential semi-legal roles in the kingdom. The Quran and the Sunna, or sayings of the prophet, are the country's constitution.
Many members of the state-employed clergy have long taught that Shi'ism is heretical. Last year, Saudi Arabia's grand mufti, the kingdom's top religious authority, said the leaders of Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional Shi'ite rival, were not Muslims.
But as the kingdom's Shi'ites have come under attack by Islamic State jihadists since 2013, authorities have also made efforts to curb open incitement and sectarianism, including arrests for anti-Shi'ite social media posts.
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (KTHV) - A Siloam Springs man has been accused of bestiality and animal cruelty after a couple set up a game camera to catch trespassers.
According to CBS affiliate KFSM, 49-year-old Everett Lee Compton, Jr. was arrested Monday and charged with five counts of cruelty to animals.
Compton was caught on a game camera having sex with a donkey. The owners of the donkey told police that they set up the camera after having problems with people harassing their pets for the past three years.
The camera then captured images on May 27, June 4, and July 5 of Compton placing a bag over the donkey's head, getting behind the animal, and "placing his pelvis against the animal's rear.
He was also apprehended on July 16 for having sex with a different donkey on the same property, according to documents.
Compton will appear in court on September 11 at Benton County Circuit Court.

The mayor of Turkey's capital city has responded to complaints over a giant robot statue by replacing it with a huge T. rex.
The robot first appeared in the middle of a roundabout in Ankara at the start of April, causing some people to assume it was an elaborate April Fool's joke. But it was actually erected to promote a new amusement park, a pet project of the city's long-time mayor Melih Gokcek. Mr Gokcek - who is often described as a colourful character - supported the park's construction over the objection of Turkey's Chamber of Architects and Engineers. The chamber is now suing him for spending taxpayers' money on the statue.
They may have more complaints now though, as the huge, Transformer-like creation has been replaced by the equally arresting sight of a 3m-high model dinosaur, Today's Zaman reports. The T. rex, teeth bared and seemingly on the prowl, was selected after the mayor asked for Twitter users' suggestions on which dinosaur to choose. It has been greeting drivers at the intersection since Wednesday. And it might not be the last statue to grace the site. "I will also replace the dinosaur with something else," Mr Gokcek says, although he hasn't given any clues as to what may come next.

Travis Lulay took a conversation topic away from his critics Friday night.
For the first time this season, Lulay threw for more than 300 yards in a game as the B.C. Lions beat the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 29-26 at B.C. Place Stadium. More importantly, he completed three touchdown passes — including one for 80 yards to Emmanuel Arceneaux — and ran for another TD himself.
Lulay had come under fire because he had not managed to hurdle the 300 barrier.
"Honestly, I feel much better about the win than I do about 300 yards," said Lulay, who completed 26-of-36 passes for 359 yards.
"The thing that's nice is that now we can stop talking about it, hopefully, a little bit."
He excelled after struggling against Montreal's blitz last week as the Alouettes pulled off a stunning comeback win. Lulay was only sacked once after he was downed five times in Montreal.
"We played much better," said Lulay, praising his offensive line for making him feel more comfortable. "We played much more confident, and we talked about playing more confident, playing faster, and the execution followed.
"Even early, I threw a couple balls a little high that a couple guys didn't handle, and we settled in and just kept playing. We overcame some of those little things. It doesn't have to be perfect. It's not going to be perfect. But when you're playing fast, and you're executing a little better, you're giving yourself more opportunities to make plays."
The B.C. quarterback surpassed 300 yards for the 14th time in his career, as the Lions improved to 6-3 at the season's halfway point.
"We're still in position to do what we want to do into the second half of the season," said Lulay, adding the Lions can head into the stretch drive with some momentum.
Streak over
Hamilton (4-5) saw its win streak end at three games. The Ticats were denied their first four-game win streak since 2010. It would have been only their second four-game victory run since 1998.
"We have to get better, obviously," said Hamilton receiver Greg Ellingson, who pulled in a two yard touchdown pass with 25 seconds left in the game to give the Lions a scare. "When you don't come out with the win, you have to improve on things, and that's what we're going to do."
After some early B.C. offensive miscues that included a wide-open Arceneaux dropping a long-bomb attempt, Lulay found the big receiver on the spectacular 80-yard touchdown that put the Lions ahead 14-7 in the second quarter and gave them the lead for good. Hamilton linebacker Courtney Greene — the last man back after defensive backs blitzed — clipped Arceneaux's heels as he ran along the sidelines.
"We just found the will," said Arceneaux. "We came in here with the mindset that this was a must-win, like every game is, and we just competed to the end. It shouldn't have been that close, but things happen, and we're going to ride with the victory."
Arceneaux was glad to make the TD catch after his earlier drop. Lulay's original plan was to keep the ball himself or use the option of a pitchout or short pass. But he unloaded a deep ball on a blitz after Arceneaux waved his arm to signal his availability.
"It wasn't an all-round blitz, but they did have a guy come around," said Lulay. "I knew I was going to take a hit, but I just had to get it out there and give (Arceneaux) a chance."
Shawn Gore and Marco Iannuzzi also scored touchdowns for B.C., while kicker Paul McCallum supplied their other points on four converts and a single off a missed field goal.
Impressive performance
Lulay completed 26-of-36 passes for 359 yards. He excelled after struggling against Montreal's blitz last week as the Alouettes pulled off a stunning comeback win.
Hamilton tried to unleash its blitz often, too, but the Lions QB countered with mid-range slant passes and the long-bomb touchdown to Arceneaux that gave the Lions an insurmountable lead in the second quarter.
After the Ticats pulled within three points, to trail 22-19, Lulay ran for what proved to be a winning two-yard touchdown with six minutes left in the game before Hamilton scored in the final minute.
Hamilton quarterback Henry Burris threw two touchdown passes, with his first going to Bakari Grant before Ellingson's late heroics. Burris matched Lulay's 36 pass attempts, completing 29 for 352 yards.
Backup quarterback Dan Lefevour ran for Hamilton's other TD. A Luca Congi field goal and safety conceded by B.C., accounted for the rest of the Ticat scoring.
But the game was all about passing as Lulay and Burris waged a quarterbacking battle, when their offences weren't struggling. The clubs only attempted one field goal and punted a combined 12 times.
When B.C.'s offence stalled, its defence came up big. The Lions recorded five QB sacks, with one by Keron Williams resulting in a forced fumble that made Hamilton go for its field goal late in the game rather than a touchdown during an ill-fated late rally.
"It's never close enough when you're on the other side of it," said Ellingson. "It doesn't matter whether you lose by one point or 10 or 50. A loss is a loss and we have to get better from here."
The Lions and Ticats conclude their home-and-home series next weekend in the Tabbies' temporary home in Guelph, Ont.
Notes: The Lions received a scare late in the second quarter as Lulay was hit along the sidelines by Simoni Lawrence on an incomplete pass that led to a punt. Lulay limped slightly as he went off and was attended by trainers but showed no ill effects afterward.
Cape Town – Eleven teenagers have died of botched circumcision within two weeks during the winter initiation season in South Africa, authorities said on Saturday.
According to Provincial Department of Traditional Affairs, all the deaths are in Eastern Cape Province, a hotbed of circumcision-related deaths.
“The death toll of initiates in a short period is alarming,'' Fikile Xasa from the department said.
He added that the deaths occurred in spite of “Zero Deaths” campaign launched by the government.
Government-dispatched teams were currently monitoring the situation across the country, according to Community Development Foundation of South Africa (CDFSA), which deals with the safety of initiates.
It, however, said over 22 boys were rescued from illegal initiation schools in the province.
The department stated that six other initiates died in the province when their initiation school caught fire, noting that their funeral was held on Saturday.
Circumcision is viewed a sacred practice in African cultures, marking a male's transition from child to adulthood.
In South Africa, young males must traditionally be circumcised as passage to manhood.
According to the CDFSA, over 70 boys died at initiation schools in 2016 and scores of others were hospitalised in the Eastern Cape alone.
Steve Ballmer doesn't use one but apparently as many as 10,000 Microsoft employees do. Embarrassingly, the device in question is Apple's iPhone.
The Wall Street Journal claims to have uncovered evidence that the Apple iPhone is now so successful, large numbers of Microsoft staff are using it instead of a device running Microsoft's recently re-launched Windows Mobile even though they do not necessarily have a 'development' reason to do so.
The estimate of 10,000 employee users came from unnamed sources who heard it quoted by executives as the volume of people accessing the Microsoft email system while using the device. Long suspected to be popular, this is the first time a credible figure has been put on iPhone use inside the company.
The popularity of the iPhone is so galling to Microsoft chief Ballmer that he is said to have taken one from an employee who was using it to snap pictures at a recent Microsoft event, and mimed stomping on it in front of other attendees to show his displeasure.
Microsoft has since allegedly changed its mobile phone reimbursement policy to exclude devices not running the company's software, the paper says.
After recently launching the Windows Mobile 6.5 refresh of what is generally agreed to be stodgy fare on offer from the company at the moment, the company is pinning its hopes on a new Smartphone platform, Windows Phone 7, due out later this year or early in 2011. The change poses risks - the new OS will be incompatible with today's software and there is also a question mark over the precise timescale for its release.
Last month, Noam Chomsky participated in a talk, presented at Harvard-Epworth Church, Cambridge, MA. Chomsky addressed the fundamentals of the American economy and the Pentagon's key role.
“The best place to look clearly is what happened when it ended,” Chomsky said. “We expanded NATO [under the Bush Administration]. [H.W.] Bush came out with a new national security strategy, [and] said, pretty much, ‘Everything will go on as before' but with new pretexts. But, because of the technological sophistication of third world powers, that why we have to have a huge military system, not to defend ourselves against the Russians, but to defend ourselves against the technological sophistication of third world powers. They said we have to maintain what they call the defense industrial base. That's a euphemism for the high tech economy, which is funded by the taxpayer, in what's called a market system.”

RYAN LIZZA: Yeah. Look, it's very hard to be in politics as long as Hillary Clinton has been in politics on the national stage and keep popularity. I mean just aside from anything you can blame on her personally about why people might not like her, support her, why her approval ratings might not be that high. Anyone in national public life right now has low approval ratings with a few exceptions. Obama's a big exception, but most of the congressional leaders have single digit approval ratings, right? Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are the first two presidential nominees whose approval rating is as the pollsters say underwater, more people disapprove of them than approve of them. So whoever wins we're going to have our first president-elect who goes into their inaugural -- now maybe it'll change in this, in the brief period between Election Day and the inauguration, but they're going to start in a bit of a hole. And you're right, that does take away a little bit from the historic nature of her election if she wins today. She's been around a long time.

Firms avoiding the payment of income taxes are good for headlines, but if we had a truly competitive market economy, the taxation of corporate profits would not be an issue because there would be no profits to tax.
Some people think profits are a divine right for entrepreneurs and shareholders and others see them as evil. I see them as an indication of the extent to which our so-called market economy is not performing the way we like to believe it does.
In a market economy a firm making profits is a signal for others to get into that field. Competition will then force prices down till an equilibrium is reached at which there are wages and a return on investment but no profits.
Generally, the owners of businesses want to limit competition to make as much profit as they can. The most effective way is to get governments to pass legislation which restricts competition. Governments are usually willing. It is an easy way to repay obligations to supporters. Licensing, trade restrictions, subsidies, copyright and patents all restrict competition. The result is that consumers pay more than they should and firms make profits. During the recent golden age of prosperity most people didn't notice but now that things are much tighter we are noticing growing inequality and the disappearance of the middle class.
I think there is a pattern here. Firms get legislation to limit competition and when the profits become too much for people to accept the calls for reform result in regulations. As corporations have more lobbying power than consumers the regulations, if anything, restrict competition even more.
As profits result from a lack of competition the extent to which firms make profits are an indication of the extent to which we do not have a market economy.
If we really believed in economic equality and if we really want to limit profits we would repeal legislation that restricts competition.

The idea of an "All-American" town might be a quaint notion in the 21st century, but they do still certainly exist across this land of ours. They can be found, too, in every corner of the country, from New York to California.
Leave it to the folks at National Geographic to come up with a list of the most totally, authentically American towns as part of their latest book, WORLD'S BEST CITIES: Celebrating 220 Great Destinations. So the next time you want a big, hunking slice of apple pie to quench your Americana thirst, consider heading out on the open road to one of these spots instead.

Donald Trump on Monday night continued to reject accusations from a number of women that he sexually assaulted them and attempted to change the subject to voter fraud, CBS News' Major Garrett reports.
At a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, the GOP presidential nominee called the sexual misconduct pure fiction and voter fraud a real deal. He went on to suggest that his whole campaign could be a waste if he loses.
“Oh, what a waste...oh, what a waste. They all say it won't be a waste, you'll be in the history books. Let me tell you something folks, I don't wanna be in the history books…I want to win,” Trump said.
“People that have died ten years ago are still voting, illegal immigrants are voting,” he added.
Evidence to support Trump in both the voter fraud case and cases of sexual assault allegations is hard to find. He then dredged up research from 2012, saying it's possible more than 20 million voters are registered improperly and some may be non-citizens. Trump, however, ignored numerous studies showing that actual voter fraud rarely occurs.
Meanwhile, his wife Melania Trump spoke out for the first time Monday since July in an interview with CNN. She said that her husband's opponents purposely put out the now famous 2005 Access Hollywood video to hurt him at this particular time.
“Everything was organized and put together to hurt him to hurt his candidacy,” she said.
She also rejected the sexual assault allegations from a number of women.
“You can't apologize for an event that never took place,” she said. “These events never took place.”
AngularJS and scope.$apply
If you've written a non-trivial amount of code in AngularJS, you may have come across the $scope.$apply() method. On the surface, it may seem like just a method you call to get your bindings to update. But why does it exist? And when do you need to use it?
To really understand when to use $apply , it's good to know exactly why we need to use it, so let's dive in!
JavaScript is Turn Based
The JavaScript code we write doesn't all run in one go, instead it executes in turns. Each of these turns runs uninterupted from start to finish, and when a turn is running, nothing else happens in our browser. No other JavaScript code runs, and our web page interface is completely frozen. This is why poorly coded JavaScript can freeze a web page.
Instead, whenever there is a task that takes some amount of time, such as an Ajax request, waiting for a click event, or setting a timeout, we set up a callback function and finish our current turn. Later, when the Ajax request completes, a click is detected, or the timer completes, a new JavaScript turn is created and the callback is run to completion.
Let's look at an example JavaScript file:
var button = document.getElementById('clickMe'); function buttonClicked () { alert('the button was clicked'); } button.addEventListener('click', buttonClicked); function timerComplete () { alert('timer complete'); } setTimeout(timerComplete, 2000);
When the JavaScript code is loaded, that is a single turn. It finds a button, adds a click listener, and sets a timeout. Then the turn is complete, and the browser will update the web page if necessary, and begin accepting user input.
If the browser detects a click on #clickMe , it creates a new turn, which executes the buttonClicked function. When that function returns, that turn is complete.
After 2000 milliseconds, the browser creates a new turn which calls timerComplete .
Our JavaScript code is run in turns, and in between the turns is when the page is repainted, and input is accepted.
So Angular lets us bind parts of our interface to data in our JavaScript code, but how does it know when data changes, and the page needs updating?
There are a few solutions. The code needs to know when a value has changed. Right now there is no way for our code to be directly notified of changes on an object . Instead there are two main strategies.
One strategy is to use special objects, where data is set via methods, not property assignments. Then changes can then be noted, and the page can be updated. This has the downside in that we must extend some special object. Also, for assigning, we must use a more verbose form obj.set('key', 'value') instead of obj.key = 'value' . Frameworks like EmberJS and KnockoutJS use this strategy.
AngularJS takes a different approach: allow any value to be used as a binding target. Then at the end of any JavaScript code turn, check to see if the value has changed. This may seem inneficient at first, but there are some clever strategies to reduce the performance hit. The big benefit is we can use normal objects and update our data however we want, and the changes will be noticed and reflected in our bindings.
For this strategy to work, we need to know when data has possibly changed, and this is where $scope.$apply comes into play.
$apply and $digest
That step that checks to see if any binding values have changed actually has a method, $scope.$digest() . That's actually where the magic happens, but we almost never call it directly, instead we use $scope.$apply() which will call $scope.$digest() for you.
$scope.$apply() takes a function or an Angular expression string, and executes it, then calls $scope.$digest() to update any bindings or watchers.
So, when do you need to call $apply() ? Very rarely, actually. AngularJS actually calls almost all of your code within an $apply call. Events like ng-click , controller initialization, $http callbacks are all wrapped in $scope.$apply() . So you don't need to call it yourself, in fact you can't. Calling $apply inside $apply will throw an error.
You do need to use it if you are going to run code in a new turn. And only if that turn isn't being created from a method in the AngularJS library. Inside that new turn, you should wrap your code in $scope.$apply() . Here is an example. We are using setTimeout , which will execute a function in a new turn after a delay. Since Angular doesn't know about that new turn, the update will not be reflected.
But, if we wrap the code for that turn in $scope.$apply() , the change will be noticed, and the page is updated.
As a convenience, AngularJS provides $timeout, which is like setTimeout , but automatically wraps your code in $apply by default. Use that, not this
If you write any code that uses Ajax without $http , or listens for events without using Angular's ng-* listeners, or sets a timeout without $timeout , you should wrap your code in $scope.$apply
$scope.$apply() vs $scope.$apply(fn)
Sometimes I see examples where data is updated, and then $scope.$apply() is called with no arguments. This achieves the desired result, but misses some opportunities.
If your code isn't wrapped in a function passed to $apply, and it throws an error, that error is thrown outside of AngularJS, which means any error handling being used in your application is going to miss it. $apply not only runs your code, but it runs it in a try/catch so your error is always caught, and the $digest call is in a final clause, meaning it will run regardless of an error being thrown. That's pretty nice.
Hopefully now you understand what $apply is and when to use it. If you only use what AngularJS provides you, you shouldn't need to use it often. But if you begin writing directives where you are observing DOM elements directly, it is going to become necessary.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Two men and a woman were found shot dead in their Detroit apartment on Friday, police said, the latest in a series of shooting incidents in the city.
The killings came two days after a gunman opened fire on what police said was an illegal gambling den in a barber shop, killing three people and injuring six.
Friday's shooting victims were in their 20s and 30s, police said.
Police told reporters on the scene that the shootings appeared to be drug related, according to WWJ Newsradio. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm that report.
In 2012, Detroit's homicide rate reached a 20-year high at 54.6 homicides per 100,000 people, according to statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
A rash of killings in Detroit has claimed several victims in the past week, including a pregnant woman, a law student and the brother of a local minister. The number of homicides is still lower than it was at this time last year, down from 331 in 2012 to 298 before Friday's shooting.

About
This is a customizable parametric processor delidding tool. Variables can be edited to fit any LGA (Land Grid Array) processors. PGA (Pin Grid Array) processors do not work with this tool.
Go to the Imgur album to see all of the pictures.
Note: For some reason, the previews for the tool base part aren't rendering properly. That is not how it will look when you print it. To see an accurate representation, look at the first screenshot of the OpenSCAD window, or the second render of the example STL file.
Customizing
You must customize this tool for your processor. The default settings are for an LGA1366 processor, which probably isn't what you're using.
Open the Customizer app, and change the variables to your processor's measurements. You probably don't need to change any in the box-margins tab.
If you are confused about any of the parameters, all you need to do is ask for clarification.
Note: When measuring the CPU, enter a little extra room, about ±0.2mm on the width and depth, if your prints shrink. If you have great dimensional accuracy you probably shouldn't worry.
Instructions
Lay the processor inside of the tool base as you would for a motherboard socket. Place the tool cover over the top of the processor so the ridge underneath butts against the edge of the processor's IHS. The underside of the cover (facing up when printed) should be flush against the top of the processor.
There should be a gap between the inner edge of the tool base and cover the same length as the margin (default: 5) specified in the variables.
The top side of the cover and base should be flush with each other. Use a C-clamp or equivalent to press the base and cover together. The threaded side of the clamp should be pushing down on the top of the cover.
The non-mobile part of the clamp should be on the bottom of the base.
Tighten the clamp securely, don't be afraid to put pressure on the processor. If there isn't enough pressure, the cover may slip and break during the next step. Place the tool in a vice, lengthwise. This will put pressure on the side of the PCB and IHS to separate the silicon seal between the two. The C-clamp will be perpendicular to the force of the vice. Slowly close the vice until you feel or hear the silicon seal break. There should be an audible snap, and tension on the vice will be reduced suddenly. The gap between the two parts should also be gone. You may want to hold the middle of the clamp while closing the vice, as when the seal snaps it may fall out of the vice. Take the tool out of the vice, and carefully remove the clamp. Hold the cover and base together while the clamp is removed. Take the processor out carefully, preferably dump it in your hand upside-down. The IHS and PCB are now separate, and your warranty void.
You should know what to do after opening the processor. The rest is on you.
Disclaimer
Your warranty is now void.
This is a risky process, but potentially very beneficial. Your processor may break. If you don't know what delidding is, please research the topic thoroughly before proceeding.
You can delid processors without a lip on the IHS, just set lip_depth to 0 . However, only do so for Intel processors. Do not delid AMD processors! All AMD chips are soldered with indium, so there is no reason to delid them anyways. See this video by der8aur if you want to know more.

Republican-led Washington is mulling the most far-reaching changes to federal labor policy in seven decades in ways that could strengthen businesses and individual workers while weakening unions' labor power as well as political strength.
The effort goes beyond rewriting parts of workplace law. The Supreme Court, the White House, leaders in Congress, and even state legislatures are all fundamentally rethinking its underlying principles: who it is meant to protect, and how and what the government's role in that should be.
The move to reshift the balance of power is being led by conservatives and libertarians and has been building for years. It focuses on empowering individual workers by making it easier for them to dissent from their union or to resist joining one, something generally not considered when the National Labor Relations Act, which became law in 1935, was drafted. Unions in effect would be turned into voluntary associations that workers drop in or out of. Unions, therefore, would have to work harder to keep members.
The push includes measures such as expanding the principle of right-to-work, which allows workers to refuse to join or otherwise financially support a union. Other changes would ensure all workplace organizing elections use a secret ballot and requiring unions to periodically be subject to recertification votes to ensure they still have their members' backing.
That would significantly shift the way the NLRA works. The law, for the most part, assumes that the unions' and workers' interests are always the same and leaves little room for dissent. That legal framework is a major source of union power, financially and otherwise, since it allows them to compel workers' support.
"This is about giving individual workers a voice. If a union is doing a good job, it shouldn't have to worry about getting recertified. It should be easy," said Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., author of the Employee Rights Act, one of the main bills congressional Republicans are backing. "Nothing about what we are talking about would make it harder for workers to organize, if that is what they want to do."
But it would make it harder for unions to raise funds. Organized labor is a major source of campaign funding for the Democratic Party, giving more than $59 million in the 2016 election cycle alone, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Conservative groups put the total unions give to Democrats, liberal activist groups, and political action committees between 2012 and 2016 at $765 million.
Labor and its allies are pushing back, fighting to preserve changes to workplace regulations made during former President Barack Obama's administration and advancing their own changes to the law. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, have introduced legislation to eliminate right-to-work altogether. But labor's allies lack the support in Congress, the White House and in courts to preserve or expand union-friendly aspects of the law.
Union leaders are bracing for the shift. "Clearly, on the business-conservative side, there is a sense that this is a moment of change for them. ... Some of them have been working for years on this," said Andrew Stern, former president of the Service Employees International Union.
Expanding the rights of individual workers
Individual worker rights were not generally envisioned when the National Labor Relations Act was created in 1935. The law takes it as a given that the interests of a union are the same as the interests of the workers it represents. That makes sense in theory since unions are supposed to be the collective voice of their workers. In reality, though, a union is a legal entity of its own that exists separate from the workers it represents. No current Ford factory workers, for example, voted to be represented the United Auto Workers, which was last certified as their union in 1941.
Amendments and court rulings have given individual workers more rights, but they still tend to be limited. In 1947, Congress allowed states to adopt right-to-work laws. The Supreme Court's 1988 Beck decision said workers could object to union dues money being spent on nonunion activity, though the burden is on the worker.
Those rights could expand dramatically under the current climate in Washington. The biggest shift is likely to come from the Supreme Court. In September, it said it would take up the case of Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. The case asks whether an Illinois state employee can be forced to pay a regular fee to a union as a condition of employment. The case could overturn a longstanding precedent, Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, that allows public-sector unions to demand payment. The court's conservative wing in the past indicated that it didn't support such precedents. Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority opinion for 2012's Knox v. SEIU that compulsory union fees "constitute a form of compelled speech and association that imposes a significant impingement on First Amendment rights."
The justices took up a similar case, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, last year and split 4-4, leaving the Abood precedent in place. It is widely believed that Justice Antonin Scalia's death prevented the court from having a majority to overturn Abood. Janus represents a second chance for the court to do that now that Justice Neil Gorsuch has replaced him.
On Capitol Hill, the Employee Rights Act has 111 co-sponsors in the House and 21 in the Senate, and Roe expects they will top last year's number, 137 co-sponsors. In addition to requiring all workplace organizing elections to have a federally monitored secret ballot, the bill would require the union to win a majority of all workers, not just a majority of the votes cast, and require it to submit to recertification votes whenever there is more than 50 percent turnover in the workplace. Workers would be allowed to tell their employers not to give their personal contact information to the union, whereas under current law workers have no say. Unions also would be required to obtain in writing the workers' permission to spend dues funds on activities not related to collective bargaining.
Other bills, such as the Save Local Business Act, by Rep. Bradley Byrne, R-Ala., would rein in the National Labor Relations Board, the main federal labor law enforcement agency, by prohibiting it from pursuing cases based on an expanded definition of "joint employer." The board has argued that any time a business can be said to have "indirect control" over another business' workforce it can be held liable for any workplace law violations there. GOP lawmakers argue that that is far too broad and the board should return to the role of "neutral umpire." Byrne's bill would amend the NLRA to say that joint employer applies only where there is "direct control," the prior standard. It was marked up by the House Education and the Workforce Committee in early October.
The White House, meanwhile, is steadily rolling back changes to the workplace rules instituted by Obama. Most notably, the Labor Department has reopened a rule that would vastly expand the number of workers covered by overtime, delayed implementation of the so-called "fiduciary" rule-making retirement investment brokers legally required to put their customers' interests ahead of their own, and rolled back the department adoption of the NLRB's joint employer rule. Trump also has given the NLRB is first GOP majority since President George. W. Bush's administration.
Obama's policies prompt push against pro-labor laws
For a long time, labor policy was an obscure field even for Washington political junkies. Only 10.7 percent of the workforce, about 14 million people, are members of a union, according to Labor Department data. The assumption for many was that labor unions were no longer relevant.
That changed during Obama's administration. Arguably the most pro-labor president since Harry Truman, Obama tried to help unions bolster their numbers in numerous ways with his appointments to the Labor Department and the NLRB. He also embraced labor's crusade for "card check" legislation.
Card check would have eliminated the ability of businesses to call for a federally monitored secret ballot election when unions say they have the support of a majority of workers.
Despite several tries in Congress from 2008 through 2012, card check never passed. Business groups such as the Chamber of Commerce argued the system would allow rampant fraud and abuse. Even moderate Democrats resisted the idea. But it did have one effect: Fighting card check made many on the Right focus on labor policy.
Aggressive actions by the NLRB such as pursuing a case in 2011 arguing that Boeing's plan to open a new plant in a right-to-work state amounted to retaliation against workers in a Washington state union sparked an outcry and caught lawmakers' attention as well.
"People who were previously never interested in what we were doing were calling us up and asking, 'What the heck is the labor movement doing?" recalled Mark Mix, president of the conservative National Right to Work Foundation, which is representing Janus before the Supreme Court.
Roe argues the catalyst was Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, who served as Obama's labor secretary. "He was an incredible activist. He changed stuff that had been the settled law for decades. It got a lot of people's attention. It certainly got mine," he said.
Concerns were rumbling outside of Washington, too. In 2011, Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker signed a law that rewrote the state's public-sector union rules to effectively put state government employees under right-to-work rules. A major union-led effort to roll back the law and oust Walker failed. His move inspired other GOP governors to follow suit.
The following year, Indiana adopted a private-sector right-to-work law. Then Michigan, Wisconsin, West Virginia and Kentucky jumped on board, bringing the total number to 27. Another state, Missouri, will have it on the ballot next year, and right-to-work efforts are underway in states such as Ohio, too.
Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., chairwoman of the Education and the Workforce Committee, notes that right-to-work laws used to be confined to the South. "The issues are spreading far beyond that. They're timely and timeless," she said.
Unions have struggled to respond. "You never say right-to-work in the union movement because it is a great example of naming something. Pretty often you cannot even explain right-to-work to union members without them thinking it sounds like a pretty good idea," Ben Johnson, former head of United Professions AFT Vermont, the union's state umbrella organization, told the Washington Examiner in September.
Brown illustrated the point in an email response to the Washington Examiner regarding his legislation to eliminate right-to-work: "At a time when Americans are working harder and earning less for the time they put in, we should be making it easier for workers to raise their voices and bargain for better wages and safer working conditions."
Rick Berman, president of the conservative Center for Union Facts, is a key architect of the Employee Rights Act, having been pushing for it since 2012. He takes the long view — his public relations firm Berman and Company is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year — a tactic he learned from the Left, he says.
The Employee Rights Act is a direct reaction to the card check push, Berman said. The fight was the first time many lawmakers even discussed the NLRA, he said. "Sen. Orrin Hatch, to his credit, said how about we go on offense? How about we change the law so that it is pro-employee?" Berman recalled.
This is the third consecutive Congress where the Employee Rights Act has been introduced. Support has built each time.
"You have to stick with an idea until it is normalized. The Left understands this. They never say they have lost — they say they haven't won yet. It's attitudinal," Berman said.
It helps that the rhetorical case for the legislation is easy to make, he says. Critics slam it as pro-business and pro-corporate because they don't want to get caught up in arguing the details. Who disputes the need for fair elections? "There is no narrative against the ERA," Berman said.
A point of agreement
All of the activity would have been unthinkable just a decade ago, Stern notes. Labor had more support among Republicans, which prevented measures such as right-to-work from ever getting off the ground.
"The labor movement is much weaker than it used to be. In the past, the building trades used to be a bulwark since they had good relations with Republicans. ... After Scott Walker, Republicans became emboldened," Stern said.
But even a union man like Stern concedes that the NLRA, an 80-year-old law written for the industrial era needs some updating. If states are going to adopt right-to-work laws, he says, they should release unions from the responsibility of representing non-members in collective bargaining. "If you are not a member of something, you shouldn't get the benefits," he said.
Roe agrees. He notes that most other membership groups operate that way. "I belong to a lot of groups that I don't always agree with, like the American Medical Association. But I have the right to belong or not to belong," he said.
That Roe and Stern can come to the same conclusion suggests that the two sides may not be that far apart. National Right To Work's Mix argues that unions will survive the change and maybe even thrive. Leaders would be forced to pay closer attention to their members and be more responsive to their needs if the workers can opt out.
"End compulsory dues, and unions will have to change their economic model. I'll be intrigued to see what they come up with. They'll have to find a way to sell their product," Mix said.

Two men have been found guilty of their part in a plot to smuggle the biggest-ever cache of machine guns into the UK. Who was behind it?
Ringleader Harry Shilling, 26, from Swanley in Kent, and his right-hand man Michael Defraine, 30, from Bexleyheath in south-east London, tapped into an underground European arms market to smuggle 31 machine guns and more than 1,500 rounds of ammunition into the UK by boat, the MV Albernina, last August.
National Crime Agency investigators say the assault rifles - Czech-made VZ58s - were "mass casualty weapons" and the network that supplied the guns also supplied Amedy Coulibaly, the man who attacked a Jewish supermarket in Paris after his co-conspirators, the Kouachi brothers, stormed the office of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in January 2015.
The attacks killed 17 people over three days.
A former French paratrooper is one of four people arrested in connection with the supply of weapons to Coulibaly. Another Frenchman, a Serbian and a Montenegro national were arrested in Spain in April.
The NCA is still investigating who exactly supplied the arsenal to Shilling and his gang, but Rob Lewin, head of specialist operations at the NCA, says the cache seized was "four times the firepower used in the Paris attacks".

The former Eastern bloc military firearms, de-activated and modified to fire blanks, were sold legally in Slovakia, only for black market arms dealers to re-activate them and sell them on across Europe.
Slovakian police say more than 1,000 of the deactivated weapons were sold by a company called AFG, based in Partizanske, a provincial town 87 miles (140 km) north east of the Slovak capital Bratislava. The Slovak government tightened the law on how firearms are decommissioned to make it more difficult for them to be re-activated, six months after the Charlie Hebdo attacks.
Frantisek Gajdos, the shop's owner, says the legislation has decreased the sale of guns abroad "to zero" and there has been less interest in Slovakia too.
The AFG website sells a large array of assault rifles, machine pistols - like the nine Skorpion machine pistols found on Albernina - and handguns. A de-activated VZ58, which when modified is capable of firing 800 live rounds a minute, can be bought for 350 euros (£276). Once obtained and illegally re-activated the same firearm can be sold for between £2,000 and £4,000 to criminal gangs in the UK.
A sat-nav device used by the Shilling gang showed that on one of their trips to the continent they had travelled less than two hours drive from AFG's showroom, which specialises in de-commissioned weapons and has a sideline in Nazi uniforms and regalia.

The investigation into Shilling - codenamed Operation Seventy - began in March 2015.
He was no stranger to criminality, although on a massively different level - he was fined once for criminal damage and on an earlier occasion he received a caution for the same offence. In 2007, when Shilling was in his teens, his father Michael was sentenced to 12 years for dealing in stolen truck parts.
The NCA's "armed operation unit" began investigating an organised criminal gang in Kent that they suspected had access to firearms.
The gang had links to a number of street gangs in London - the kind of criminals who would be eager to pay cash to buy or hire firearms.

At first, investigators were unsure of Shilling's role, but as their work progressed they realised just how central he was.
Shilling made consistent attempts to cover his tracks. He was what the prosecution called "forensically aware".
The gang wore blue surgical gloves when they handled the weapons and unloaded their arsenal from the Albernina. Shilling changed his mobile phone five times during the investigation and communicated with Defraine via phones protected by encryption software.
Image caption The MV Albernina brought the guns into Kent from Boulogne in France last August
In a series of messages to an unidentified potential customer known as "B", investigators learned Shilling was willing to sell some of the weapons with ammunition, and he had plans to import more weapons for use by criminal gangs.
Exchanges between Shilling and Defraine revealed their excitement that the guns had safely been brought back from the continent.
Shilling told Defraine: "We are a firm ant we?" Defraine replied: "Proper heavy and armed to the teeth no one wants beef fam."
Shilling wanted to expand his fledgling criminal empire by becoming the UK's top armourer.
One of the gang had stored the number of one of Shilling's many phones under the name Kaiser. The prosecution said this was an in-joke and reference to Keyser Soze - the character from the cult crime movie The Usual Suspects.
In one of his encrypted messages Shilling boasted, "we now officially gangsters". When he was arrested he had a panic attack and had to be given first aid.
David Payne, 43, Richard Rye, 24, and Christopher Owen, 30, had all already pleaded guilty to smuggling the weapons into the UK. Payne and Rye also admitted the second count.
Two other defendants in the case, Jenny Arthy, 42, and John Smale, 58, were cleared of all charges.
Nissan's long-awaited second generation of its battery-electric Leaf could make a public appearance as early as in a few weeks. However, the car's range could initially be a little less than the expected 400 kilometers (250 miles) per the optimistic Japanese standard.
On Friday, Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn dropped heavy hints of a major announcement at the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.
“I am not giving you advance notice of what we'll be showing at CES in Las Vegas. I want people to go to the show,” Ghosn told the gaggle of reporters brought up to the 22nd floor of Nissan's Yokohama tower to receive their annual Christmas present: an hour with the Great Gesticulator, Carlos Ghosn himself, CEO now of not just two, but, three global automakers after the successful takeover of Mitsubishi Motors. “It will be a substantial presentation. We will show the public how much our cars are going to change with the technology we are going to be implementing,” Ghosn continued.
The Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas lately has attracted an increasing number of carmakers, eager to show their prowess with new technology beyond overhead camshafts. Nissan, the world's first volume maker of battery-electric vehicles and holder of half their global market share together with alliance partner Renault, will be at the show for the first time. Not only that, Carlos Ghosn will open the show with a keynote speech. The boss doesn't want to come to Vegas empty-handed. “We are not going to CES just because everybody is going there,” Ghosn said. “This is about substance.”
So, what will Nissan be showing at CES? Recently, I speculated in front of a few Yokohama insiders that the new long-range Nissan Leaf electric car would be shown at the Tokyo Motor Show late next year. That earned a dismissive wave. “I think you'll be hearing about the car much earlier than that,” I was told. Looking at the calendar of major auto shows in 2017, we can scratch off Shanghai in April – the Leaf won't be sold in China. Frankfurt Auto Show? Zoe territory. Until this morning, I had circled the Detroit auto show (January 8 – 22) as the earliest possibility. Listening to Ghosn, I changed my mind by a few days. CES opens its door on January 5 in Sin City.
After listening to Ghosn, I leaned over to Nissan's global PR chief Jonathan Adashek, and said: “So, do I have to assume you'll announce the new Leaf at CES?” He put on his best poker face, and sybillinely said: “We shall see.”
Ghosn first talked about a Leaf with more than 400 km range two years ago. Sales of the current model promptly took a hit after that, because people wanted the longer-range version with the new cool design instead of the current frumpy one. For more than a year, Nissan has been showing off its Nissan IDS concept car. The new Leaf will look pretty similar, Nissan's design chief Shiro Nakamura told me in a Beijing bar.
But where is the new Leaf? “Our electric cars have the world's highest share of market, but maybe not the highest share of voice,” Ghosn said Friday. If Nissan doesn't start talking about the new Leaf real quick, it might get forgotten. GM has launched its 238 mile (383 km, EPA) range Bolt. In Europe, the Leaf's sister model, the Renault Zoe with a 400 km (250 mi) (NEDC) range will be available in January, as Ghosn said Friday. The Zoe “is not two, or three years down the road, it is now,” Ghosn trolled in the direction of Tesla's Model 3 and the many real-soon-now EVs. But where is the new Leaf? Officially, the ship date of the new Leaf remains a mystery. Today, the triple CEO himself convinced me that a lifting of the shroud should be impending.
That is the good news. The not-so-good news is that rumors won't die in Yokohama that Nissan may have a little problem with its battery, which could lead “to a little disappointment” when the new Leaf finally is announced. In its first year of existence, the new Leaf's range could be not quite as breath-taking, consistent Yokohama scuttlebutt says, and the far-ranging version could come a little later as an option. That, of course, no one can, or wants to confirm in Yokohama, so it might or might not be true.
As Adashek said, “we shall see.”
Understanding Asymmetric Numeral Systems
Apparently, Google is trying to patent (an application of) Asymmetric Numeral Systems, so I spent some time today learning what it is.
In its essense lies a simple and beautiful idea.
ANS is a lossless compression algorithm. Its input is a list of symbols from some finite set. Its output is a positive integer. Each symbol \(s\) has a fixed known probability \(p_s\) of occurring in the list. The algorithm tries to assign each list a unique integer so that the more probable lists get smaller integers.
If we ignore the compression part (assigning smaller integers to more probable inputs), the encoding could be done as follows: convert each symbol to a number from \(0\) to \(B-1\) (where \(B\) is the number of symbols), add a leading 1 to avoid ambiguities caused by leading zeros, and interpret the list as an integer written in a base-\(B\) positional system.
This encoding process is an iterative/recursive algorithm:
Start with the number 1; If the current number is \(n\) , and the incoming symbol correspond to a number \(s\) , update the number to be \(s + n\cdot B\) .
The decoding process is a corecursive algorithm:
Start with the number that we are decoding; Split the current number \(n\) into the quotient and remainder modulo \(B\) ; Emit the remainder and continue decoding the quotient; Stop when the current number reaches 1.
(The decoding is LIFO: the first decoded element will be the last encoded element.)
This encoding scheme relies on the standard isomorphism between the sets \(\{0,\ldots,B-1\}\times \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}\) and \(\mathbb{Z}_{\geq B}\), established by the functions
\[f(s,n) = s + n\cdot B;\] \[g(n) = (n \bmod B, [n/B]).\]
(The peculiar domain and codomain of this isomorphism are chosen so that we have \(\forall n,s.\;f(s,n) > n\); this ensures that the decoding process doesn't get stuck.)
We can represent this in Haskell as
And the standard isomorphism which we used in the simple encoding process is
(The functions are more complicated than they have to be to support symbol types like Int . Int does not start at 0 and is prone to overflow.)
Let's now turn to the general form of the isomorphism
\[f \colon \{0,\ldots,B-1\}\times \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1} \to \mathbb{Z}_{\geq \beta};\] \[g \colon \mathbb{Z}_{\geq \beta} \to \{0,\ldots,B-1\}\times \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}.\]
(In general, \(\beta\), the smallest value of \(f\), does not have to equal \(B\), the number of symbols.)
If we know (or postulate) that the second component of \(g\), \(g_2\colon \mathbb{Z}_{\geq \beta} \to \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}\), is increasing, then we can recover it from the first component, \(g_1\colon \mathbb{Z}_{\geq \beta} \to \{0,\ldots,B-1\}\).
Indeed, for a given \(s=g_1(n)\), \(g_2\) must be the unique increasing isomorphism from \[A_s = \{f(s,m)\mid m\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}\} = \{n\mid n\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq \beta}, g_1(n) = s\}\] to \(\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}\). To find \(g_2(n)\), count the number of elements in \(A_s\) that are \(\leq n\).
Similarly, we can recover \(f\) from \(g_1\). To compute \(f(s,n)\), take \(n\)th the smallest number in \(A_s\).
In Haskell:
For every function \(g_1\colon \mathbb{Z}_{\geq \beta} \to \{0,\ldots,B-1\}\) (named classify in Haskell), we have a pair of encode/decode functions, provided that each of the sets \(A_s\) is infinite. In particular, we can get the standard encode/decode functions (originally defined by std_iso ) by setting classify to
By varying \(g_1\) (and therefore the sets \(A_s\)), we can control which inputs get mapped to smaller integers.
If \(A_s\) is denser, \(f(s,n)\), defined as \(n\)th the smallest number in \(A_s\), will be smaller.
If \(A_s\) is more sparse, \(f(s,n)\) will be larger.
The standard isomorphism makes the sets \[A_s = \{ s+n\cdot B \mid n\in \mathbb Z_{\geq 1} \} \] equally dense for all values of \(s\). This makes sense when all \(s\) are equally probable.
But in general, we should make \(A_s\) denser for those \(s\) that are more frequent. Specifically, we want
\[ \frac{|\{k\in A_s \mid k \leq x\}|}{x} \approx p_s. \]
Substituting \(x=f(s,n)\) then gives \(\log_2 f(s,n) \approx \log_2 n + \log_2 (1/p_s)\). This means that adding a symbol \(s\) costs \(\log_2 (1/p_s)\) bits, which is what we should strive for.
Here's a simple example of a suitable \(g_1\):
This is a periodic function. It computes the number of times each symbol \(s\) will appear within a single period as \(k_s=\mathrm{round}(p_s/\min \{p_s\})\). The number \(p_s/\min \{p_s\}\) is chosen for its following two properties:
it is proportional to the probability of the symbol, \(p_s\) ; it is \(\geq 1\) , so that even the least likely symbol occurs among the values of the function.
The function then works by mapping the first \(k_0\) numbers to symbol \(0\), the next \(k_1\) numbers to symbol \(1\), and so on, until it maps \(k_{B-1}\) numbers to symbol \(B-1\) and repeats itself. The period of the function is \(\sum_s k_s\approx 1/\min \{p_s\}\).
classify_prob rearranges the symbols in the order of decreasing probability, which gives further advantage to the more probable symbols. This is probably the best strategy if we want to allocate integers in blocks; a better way would be to interleave the blocks in a fair or random way in order to keep the densities more uniform.
Another downside of this function is that its period may be too small to distinguish between similar probabilities, such as 0.4 and 0.6. The function used in rANS is better in this regard; it uses progressively larger intervals, which provide progressively better approximations.
But classify_prob is enough to demonstate the idea. Let's encode a list of booleans where True is expected 90% of time.
Four True s compress much better than four False s. Let's also compare the number of bits in 11111 with the number of bits that the information theory predicts are needed to encode four events with probability 0.1:
Not bad.
The implementation of ANS in this article is terribly inefficient, especially its decoding part, mostly because the isomorphism uses brute force search instead of computation. The intention is to elucidate what the encoding scheme looks like and where it comes from. An efficient implementation of ANS and its different variants is an interesting topic in itself, but I'll leave it for another day.

Buoyed by an uptick in national polling, Donald Trump is expected on Wednesday to outline the reasons he still thinks he can win heavily Democratic New York as he accepts the small but influential Conservative Party's nomination for president.
Trump, who will deliver an evening address as the Conservatives wind up their convention at the Marriott Marquis in Times Square, “thinks he can win New York, as difficult as that may seem to people out there, if the stars align correctly,'' a senior Trump campaign operative told The Post.
“New York means a lot to Mr. Trump and he has not by any means given up on the state,'' the operative said.
Longtime Conservative Party Chairman Mike Long told The Post, “I know how difficult it would be to win this state,” but he added Trump does have a shot.
“Trump's numbers upstate are pretty good, and they're pretty good on Long Island, so I don't think it's impossible that he could take New York. And I don't see any real enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton out there, and that's an indicator,'' Long said.
A recent Siena College poll of New York voters found Clinton with a massive 30 percentage-point lead over Trump, but Trump campaign insiders insist the gap will close quickly if their candidate performs strongly in the upcoming debates.
Long conceded that several high-profile conservatives have refused to endorse the Trump campaign, but said he was hopeful they would reconsider.
“While I understand and respect the point of view of conservatives who have been opposing him, Trump is, in fact, the most conservative candidate running for president on a wide range of issues, including immigration, jobs, taxes, Supreme Court appointments and regaining our image as a world leader,'' Long said.
The Trump campaign source said “tentative approval'' has just been given to an ambitious New York strategy plan that calls for the opening of 10 campaign operation centers and the heavy use of phone banks, direct mail, and other get-out-the vote efforts.
Long Island Democrats are increasingly optimistic — thanks to a federal judge, Republican rivalries, and what they see as a lagging Trump campaign — that they'll be able to hold on to the North Shore's Third Congressional District seat being vacated by longtime US Rep. Steve Israel, the outgoing chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
Former Nassau County Executive Tom Suozzi, the Democratic contender who mounted an ill-fated challenge to Eliot Spitzer in the Democratic primary for governor 10 years ago, held a 16-point lead over state Sen. Jack Martins in a Democrat-sponsored poll released last month, but a federal judge delivered even worse news to Martins.
The jurist ruled that a resources-draining special Republican congressional primary must be held Oct. 6 because state judges, at the urging of longtime Nassau County GOP election lawyer John Ciampoli, had improperly denied long-shot challenger Philip Pidot the opportunity to challenge Martins in the regularly scheduled June 28 primary.
Stung by the ruling, Martins — in a rare maneuver that stunned many election lawyers — sought unsuccessfully to have a federal judge reschedule the congressional balloting from Nov. 8, the date of the general elections, to Dec. 6.
Martin has appealed the judge's decision.
Barely a month since it surpassed 100,000 rides in record time, Philadelphia's bike share system, Indego, shows no signs of slowing down.
The new system dealt out over 180,000 rides in its first one hundred days, putting an end to the great depression local bike enthusiasts felt while watching other cities get bike share before Philly. (Speaking of new deals, walk-up half-hour rides are only $1 on the first Tuesday of every month; they are usually $4.)
PlanPhilly recently sat down with Aaron Ritz and Cara Ferrentino – the bicycle program manager and strategic initiatives manager at the Mayor's Office of Transportation and Utilities, respectively – to get an update on the objectively popular program and a sneak peak at its Phase 2 expansion that they are already beginning to plan.
Indego hit 100,000 about 60 days after launch and blew past 180,000 at 100 days, which means bike share has only gotten more popular as Philadelphians grow more familiar with it.
To date, over 33,000 unique riders have given Indego a spin – that includes walk-up riders and members. Daily ridership averages around 1,800, fluctuating between 1,500 and 2,200. The bikes average about 3 rides a day, which is up from 2 rides a day a month after the launch.
MOTU, or at least Ritz and Ferrentino, really wants to hear from you, the public, as they plan Indego's expansion. They literally asked for it: “In the article, we'd love it if you could… release the nerds, I guess,” said Ritz, asking PlanPhilly to include his and Ferrentino's email addresses in this article. “People in neighborhoods know their neighborhood better than we would: where people go, where they shop, and where there is space.” So fire away at (aaron.ritz@phila.gov and cara.ferrentino@phila.gov).
“That's how we found Darien and Catharine,” added Ferrentino, referring to the recently expanded Indego station in Bella Vista that's now the largest in the city. MOTU would have never even considered a small side street like Darien without a Bella Vista resident's suggestion.
“We really appreciate being invited to community association meetings,” said Ferrentino. MOTU wants to talk with local residents “about where they would like bike share, where it would be the most useful and compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.”
Local input is vital, said Ritz, due to the intense difficulty in finding good locations for stations. A station requires a minimum length of 60 feet, at least a 12-foot wide sidewalk (or other publically accessible, off-street space) and, preferably, a decent amount of sunshine (the stations are solar powered).
MOTU and Bicycle Transit Systems, the third-party contractor that manages Indego's day-to-day operations, have only begun to dig into the reams of data the ride share system produces.
One of the first sets of hard numbers the team's looked at has been how frequently the stations have been empty or full. An empty or full station acts as “an indication of latent demand,” said Ferrentino. “What trips might have taken place had a bike—or a dock—been available?”
Based off that indicator of station popularity, MOTU added docks to the Indego stations at Darien and Catharine Streets, and Front and Carpenter Streets. They will also soon add stations to the frequently full Foglietta Plaza, better known to most Philadelphians as That Place Across Columbus Boulevard From The Spruce Street Harbor Park.
Just because a station is used a lot doesn't mean it's begging for expansion. The Rittenhouse Square station is also one of the top-used, but because it services a mix of commuters heading to work, nearby employees taking lunch trips and tourists, that station rarely becomes full of bikes or empty.
There are other very popular stations that lack expansion options due to space constraints and existing street infrastructure like telephone poles and fire hydrants. The Indego station at 23rd Street and South, next to the Gray's Ferry Triangle, is a top five spot in terms of ride traffic, but they've already crammed as many docks as possible there. Adding another station nearby to alleviate that demand will be a priority as the team inches towards Indego's Phase 2 expansion.
“The two goals are increasing range and increasing reliability,” said Ritz. Range means pushing further north, south and west with more stations, and reliability means filling neighborhood holes (like Society Hill, which currently lacks a station) and adding more stations to heavily used stations like Gray's Ferry Triangle.
Ritz said another of the expansion priorities would be more access to the Schuylkill River, and mentioned the possibility of adding a large station near the Falls Bridge.
The Phase 2 expansion will see the system grow to 1,800 bicycles across 180 locations, just under three times the number of bikes (650) and stations (72) available today. With the exception of smaller tweaks – a few docks here, a new station there, and a trickle of new bikes – the expansion won't start in earnest until next spring.
While the Independence Blue Cross sponsorship and city funds have the operational budget set for the next few years, MOTU is still working on securing capital funds for the expansion.
MOTU, with support from the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia, continues to reach out to low and moderate income communities and communities of color to promote Indego.
Indego is the only bike share program in the United States that offers a cash option for memberships, a feature aimed at lower income residents who lack credit or debit cards. So far, about one percent of members use the cash option. But those riders make up four percent of total rides, said Ritz. “People who chose to pay in cash are using the system, and use it well.”
Despite some concerns, bicycle theft has not been a problem, said Ferrentino.
* Ex-PM Hatoyama at anti-nuclear rally bad news for PM Noda
* Efforts to pick new atomic safety commission members snags after media leak
* Nuclear energy becoming bigger part of political debate (Recasts with ex-PM Hatoyama joining anti-nuclear demo near)
By Mari Saito and Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO, July 20 (Reuters) - In a rare move by a former Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama joined a boisterous anti-nuclear demonstration outside his old office on Friday, a fresh sign that the ruling party he once led is fracturing over energy and other policies.
Japan's debate over nuclear power has become increasingly heated after incumbent Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda's decision to restart idled reactors despite persistent public safety concerns following last year's Fukushima nuclear crisis.
The question of nuclear power's role in a new energy portfolio the government is set to decide next month is adding to divisions in Noda's Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), already rent by feuds over his plan to double the sales tax to curb debt and the possibility Tokyo might join a U.S.-led trade deal.
On Monday, an estimated 100,000 anti-nuclear protesters took to the streets in Tokyo, while ever-bigger crowds have been gathering every Friday outside Noda's office.
“It is truly regrettable that the voices of all of you gathered here today are so far removed from politics and the prime minister's office,” said Hatoyama, wearing a clear raincoat under a steady drizzle and surrounded by reporters.
“As a former prime minister ... I want to take your message inside the prime minister's office,” he said after shaking hands with a few of the thousands of demonstrators.
He then entered Japan's equivalent of the White House, where Kyodo news agency said he met Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura.
Hatoyama took office in 2009 when the Democrats swept to power for the first time but quit after less than a year in office, felled by charges of incompetence and failure to keep a campaign promise to move a U.S. military base off the southern island of Okinawa.
Hatoyama's participation was cheered by some protesters but dismissed by others as grandstanding.
“He can come here and say something impressive but it doesn't really matter,” said Osamu Arai, a 65-year-old construction worker taking part in the demonstration.
“This is a grass roots movement. Things change very slowly in Japan, but we must continue to protest.”
FURTHER FRACTURES
Hatoyama's gesture however was another sign that Noda's Democratic Party is in danger of unravelling further.
Earlier this week, three members of parliament's upper house left the DPJ, citing opposition to the reactor restarts, the sales tax and the possibility that Japan might join a U.S.-led free trade pact.
They were the latest to bolt after former DPJ leader Ichiro Ozawa, an unpopular political veteran, led dozens out of the DPJ to set up a new party, also protesting against the sales tax and promising to wean Japan from its reliance on nuclear power.
Hatoyama, who also opposes the tax hike, has already hinted that he and his DPJ backers might follow suit.
The government is set to decide on a new energy mix next month to replace a scrapped 2010 programme that had sought to raise nuclear power's share to more than half of electricity needs by 2030 from about 30 percent before the Fukushima crisis triggered by the huge earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.
Most experts expect Noda to opt for a 15 percent share for atomic power in electricity supply by 2030, an option that would require the restart of all 50 of Japan's reactors — all but two of which are now idled for safety checks — before gradually closing older units.
Two reactors in western Japan have resumed operations, one just this week.
Noda has been hit by a string of setbacks on nuclear policy this week.
First, critics blasted the government's handling of public hearings on the energy portfolio after employees of utilities were among the few chosen to speak.
Then on Friday, media leaks forced the government to delay nominating candidates for a new atomic safety watchdog that it hopes will instil more confidence than current regulators, criticised for their cosy ties with the power industry.
Newspapers reported on Friday that the government had picked Shunichi Tanaka, 67, an expert in radiation physics and a former deputy head of the Cabinet Office's Atomic Energy Commission, to head the new safety regulator.
Tanaka drew mixed reviews from anti-nuclear groups, with some saying he represented Japan's “nuclear village” — a nexus of politicians, utilities and regulators that experts say was a major factor in the failure to avert the Fukushima disaster.
Others, though, noted that after the disaster Tanaka spoke of the need to reflect on the way nuclear power had been promoted.
“We can be somewhat positive, but we cannot have great hopes,” said Hideyuki Ban, secretary-general of the Citizens' Nuclear Information Center. (Editing by Ed Lane)

Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller ratcheted up the pressure on Gov. Larry Hogan Friday to expedite the appointment of a new Democratic senator from Montgomery County to fill a vacancy in the 47-member body.
Del. Craig J. Zucker was chosen by the county Democratic Central Committee a week ago Thursday to fill the seat left empty by the the resignation of Sen. Karen Montgomery. Montgomery announced in December that she would leave in the middle of her second term because of worsening health. Her retirement became official Jan. 1.
Under the Maryland Constitution, when a legislative seat becomes vacant the departing lawmaker's party gets to choose the replacement. The choice is forwarded to the governor, who then has 15 days to make the appointment. The law doesn't permit the governor to substitute another choice.
For the second time in the past week, the Senate chief publicly called on Hogan to install Zucker without running out the string.
"We have an empty seat back there," Miller said from the Senate rostrum. "We'd like to have that seat filled -- not just for any one bill but for all bills."
The "one bill" Miller referred to is one passed by the General Assembly last year allowing released felons to vote before completing parole or probation. Hogan vetoed the measure, but legislative leaders decided this month to attempt an override.
The House voted last week to override the veto after House Speaker Michael E. Busch mustered the minimum 85 votes to do so. Among those voting for the override was Zucker, still a delegate.
With the Senate override count apparently one short due to Montgomery's departure, Miller postponed action -- presumably until he has the necessary 29th vote. Zucker, a second-term delegate, could find himself in the rare position of casting an override vote on the same bill in both chambers.
So far, Hogan has been in no hurry to hasten that day.
Hogan spokesman Doug Mayer said he had no idea when the governor will act.
"We appreciate the Senate president's concern but the Governor's Office has a process and we intend to follow it," Mayer said. "We have a vetting process and that is what's under way."
Mayer said any delay has nothing to do with the override vote.
In reply to Miller, Senate Minority Whip Steve Hershey spoke up in Hogan's defense. He said that while the governor had 15 days to make the appointment official, only a week had passed.
Hershey, an Eastern Shore Republican, noted that over that week Hogan has been dealing with one of the largest snowstorms to hit the region in recent history. He suggested that a senatorial appointment could wait.
"It might not be the top item on his list to do," Hershey said.
The governor has until the end of next week to make the appointment.
NEW DELHI: India and energy-rich Qatar today signed six agreements including one on transfer of sentenced prisoners as the two countries sought to inject a fresh momentum in their bilateral ties.The pacts were signed after Emir of Qatar Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani held extensive talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during which both the leaders discussed a range of issues including enhancing cooperation in energy sector and boosting trade and investment.Under the provision of the pact on transfer of sentenced persons, Indian prisoners convicted in Qatar can be brought to India to serve the remaining part of their sentence. Similarly Qatari citizens convicted in India can be sent to their home country to serve jail term.According to official figure, 96 Indians are currently languishing in various jails in Qatar which is home to around 600,000 Indians.The other five MoUs will provide for cooperation in areas like information and communication technology, atmospheric and ocean sciences and media.Qatar is an important country for India in the Gulf region. It supplies 86 per cent of India's Liquified Natural Gas (LNG). The bilateral annual trade is around USD 16 billion.The MoU in the field of information and communication technology would provide enhanced business opportunities for Indian IT industry in Qatar.Qatar has embarked on an ambitious programme for overall development as part of its Qatar 2030 vision and has created a dedicated Ministry of Information and Communication Technology for capacity building in ICT.Another MoU was signed between Ministry of Earth Sciences and Qatar Meteorological Department for cooperation in the field of atmospheric and ocean sciences.A separate MoU was inked between Diplomatic Institute of Qatar's Foreign Ministry and Foreign Service Institute of External Affairs Ministry to facilitate exchange of faculty members and experts.The two sides also finalised a pact to encourage regular exchange of radio and TV programmes and content between Prasar Bharati and Qatar Media Cooperation.
At least 100 people marched Friday evening to the home of Portland Mayor Charlies Hales, protesting forced evictions earlier this week from City Hall and chanting "Charlie resign now!"
Several of them erected 15 tents near the home -- half on the grass strip between Hales' house and the street, the other half on a grass strip next to the sidewalk bordering Eastmoreland Golf Course across the street.
The march, the makeshift camp and the nearby presence of Portland police officers - coming on the heels of Wednesday's raucus clash -- presented a potent mix for a volatile confrontation. But calm prevailed, perhaps propelled by a city staple: steady rain that pelted the scene starting about an hour after the protesters arrived.
Before the rains came, the protesters looked prepared for an extended presence in front of Hales' house. The mayor didn't make an appearance and tweeted later in the night from an event at the Asian Health & Services Center.
"We are here to tell Mayor Charlie Hales we do have a reason to protest," march organizer Gregory McKelvey said through a megaphone in front of the house. "Since he didn't want us at City Hall, we took it to his house. If we can't be comfortable you can't be comfortable."
On Wednesday, police officers pushed protesters out of City Hall and pepper-sprayed some of them after City Council members voted to approve a three-year contract with police officers during a session closed to all but media and few others. At least two protesters went to the hospital, Don't Shoot Portland leaders said. One police officer had injuries that weren't serious, police said. Ten protesters were arrested.
Don't Shoot Portland leaders said on Facebook that they were shut out of the democratic process when the mayor moved the council meeting, largely closing it to the public.
Starting about 4 p.m. Friday, protesters left a gathering area a half-mile north of the mayor's house. Before departing, they loaded an SUV with water and food, listened to a detail-rich description of how to deal with pepper spray and wrote down the phone number to call if they were arrested.
They marched onto Oregon 99 East, blocking traffic for a few minutes, before marching onward into a neighborhood, eventually arriving in Eastmoreland and its stately homes. Lead organizers McKelvey and Teressa Raiford said the group decided to walk through residential areas so everyone in the city would know that they need to demand change from the city -- and not just click "like" on social media posts.
Organizers refused to divulge the destination - wanting to preserve an element of surprise. For whom, it wasn't clear: No one appeared to be at the mayor's house when they arrived, and police weren't in sight hours before the march and when the tent-setting began.
By 7 p.m. - the two-hour mark of the occupation -- a police SUV was parked near the protesters. But for the most part, the police presence was minimal from the time the march started through the evening.
Earlier, two police officers on motorcycles were waiting about a block away from Hales' house next to a public garden at the intersection of Southeast Bybee Boulevard and 27th Street. A truck carrying at least 10 officers in riot gear also staged for a time in a parking lot near the garden, but eventually sped away from the scene.
When rumors of police officers arriving swept through the crowd, shouts of "Film the police!" erupted.
At one point, McKelvey urged the crowd, "Do not provoke the police."
A proposed body camera policy for police was the source for some protesters' disapproval of the police union contract. While the camera policy wasn't part of the contract, its details were discussed between city and police negotiators at the same time as the contract.
At Hales' home, as the rain began, organizer Micah Rhodes said the group could stay camped out for a couple of days if necessary. "We won't leave if a storm comes," he said.
In addition to seeking resignation of Hales - whose term is set to expire in less than three months -- McKelvey said the group, which also is affiliated with #BlackLivesMatter, wants to recall Commissioner Nick Fish.
Shortly before 8 p.m., with rain continuing to fall, Rhodes succinctly described protesters' immediate plan: "We're staying."

That's what the hate speech debate is about. You must decide whether or not you believe in the rights of the one to speak out against the many – whether you believe in the right of the minority to have a different view, or not.
It is unlikely that you will admire the broader philosophies of both of these men. But it is possible to admire their bravery – their willingness to stand alone before a crowd and say, you're wrong, and I, alone, will tell you why.
But he went down to Wembley anyway. And he got arrested, anyway.
The first person to speak out in his defence was Peter Tatchell, the gay rights campaigner. Tatchell said, I find his views repugnant. But next week, I'm going down to Wembley. They're holding a massive rally for the most fundamentalist Islamic clerics they can find. And I want to go down with my sign that says “Islam kills queers.” If they arrest him, they're going to arrest me.
There was a man called Harry Hammond once. He was a Christian Evangelical. He used to go to Gay Pride marches and hold up a sign saying “homosexuality is wrong”. “Sodomy is evil”. He got arrested for committing a breach of the peace.
As I read the fascinating debate provoked by Peter Cuthbertson's post about the PCSO who apparently told two Christians that they couldn't promote Christianity in a "Muslim area", it seemed to me that this wasn't just a debate about religion, but also about the concept of hate speech.
It is always going to be the minority view, because the majority's view will never be classified as hate speech.
I believe that part of the job of democracy is to protect the minority against they tyranny of the majority.
It's important to say that, just like the Christians handing out Bible extracts in the so-called "Muslim area," neither Hammond nor Tatchell presented any kind of threat to those against whom they were protesting. They were simply presenting ideas that others didn't like. And they got shut down. Is that what you want to happen to ideas?
As shown by the Hammond and Tatchell examples, that happens under the status quo. How much worse do you think ideas will be treated with hate speech laws?
If you think that someone's ideas are wrong, if you think they are repugnant and obviously beyond the pale, then you should argue against them. In the marketplace of ideas, if they really are repugnant and wrong, you'll win. The proper remedy for the delivery of someone's speech, which you think or know to be wrong, is the exercise of your own right to free speech – not the limitation of theirs.
Think about what happens if we don't take that approach. If, rather than listen and then confront, you just get to shut down the debate by having the person carted away or silenced, then you may like it – for as long as your views, your ideas, are the ones not being trampled on.
To protect your freedom of speech, it's necessary to protect everyone's freedom of speech – even those whom you find unsettling or unpleasant.
We need to preserve the right to shock and offend. Apart from anything else, often it is the shocking and offensive notion that on reflection and debate and struggle emerges as the truth. Think of those who first said to their scandalised peers, you know, I think that women should have the right to vote. Shocking. Offensive. Published. Debated. Vindicated.
So the right to free speech must necessarily protect repugnant speech. That's not to say that people can say anything they like – we already have laws against incitement to violence. But hate speech laws go further. They are about stopping the expression of certain ideas per se and that's wrong.
What kind of majority system requires special protection from the minority even from saying that they disagree? What virtue can be ascribed to a system that can't stand up to minority criticism?
Every so often an idea will emerge that, through the fire of testing in the battle of ideas, will be of some use to society.
As I picture Peter Tatchell, alone, representing no threat to anyone, being dragged away by the police, away from an enormous group of people, his sign dangling in his hand, I find myself convinced that he had won.
And I prefer to have the potential danger of an extremist, minority fringe with whom we can argue, to the certainty of an over-powerful state with which we cannot.
The Old Appomattox Court House is a structure within the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park.[3] In the 1800s, this structure gave the surrounding village the name, Appomattox Court House. The 1865 surrender at the nearby McLean House was significant in ending the American Civil War. The court house was registered in the National Park Service's database of Official Structures on June 26, 1989.[4] It is located on Virginia State Route 24, three miles (5 km) northeast of the town of Appomattox in Appomattox County, Virginia, where the "new" Appomattox Court House is located.[5]
History [ edit ]
Reconstructed Old Appomattox County "Court House"
The original "old" Appomattox Court House was the first county seat of Appomattox County, Virginia. It was built in 1846, one year after Appomattox County was established, at what was known then as Clover Hill, Virginia. It was the second government public structure built after Appomattox County became official. It was in the center of the village on a large green lot surrounded by the Richmond-Lynchburg stage road.[5] The first building constructed after the county became official was the original wooden county jail built in 1845. The original courthouse was built across the street from the Clover Hill Tavern in 1846. This original courthouse building burned down in 1892. A second courthouse was constructed in 1892, which is near the location of the Appomattox Station in the town of Appomattox, Virginia.[6]
The reconstructed "old" Appomattox Court House is now the visitor center for the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park. On the first floor is the information desk. On the second floor is a museum and the auditorium. An interpretive video presents the events of General Lee's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia's surrender to Lieutenant General Grant. Civil War weapons are on display, as are many photographs relating to the event.[7] The "old" Appomattox Court House was reconstructed in 1963 and 1964 as the park's visitor center and information desk for the National Park Service.[8]
Historical significance [ edit ]
Civil War museum pieces on second floor
The original county "court house" played no role in the surrender of General Robert E. Lee to General Ulysses S. Grant, as it was Palm Sunday and the court was closed for the day. The actual surrender took place at the McLean House. The National Park Service states that the Old Appomattox Court House is of paramount importance by virtue of its association with the site. It is vital under certain criteria of the National Park Service and by virtue of its creation of the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park by federal law. It represents the participation of the federal government in the preservation and commemoration of historically significant events.[9]
Description of old "court house" [ edit ]
The reconstructed Old Appomattox Court House is a two-story structure of running bond brick with a raised second floor main entry. There is a second story east and west entry porch. The building has newel posts and balusters. The four-panel entry doors on the main level are flanked by 12/12 double hanging sash windows. The size of the structure is fifty feet wide by forty feet deep. It has three bays with a hipped flat-seam roof with wood trusses.[8]
The rebuilt edifice has a brick paved first floor beneath the second floor hipped-roof porch with brick cast stone steps and cast iron railings. The lower level has a similar layout with a smaller four-panel door flanked by 8/8 double hanging sash windows. The end elevations have two internal chimneys flanked by 8/8 double hanging sash windows on the first floor with three 8/8 double hanging sash windows on the second level. There is a third sash window located in the center. All the windows of the "court house" have shutters.[10]
NASA Begins Launch Preparations for Next Mars Mission
by Staff Writers
Kennedy Space Center FL (SPX) Aug 07, 2013
NASA's next spacecraft going to Mars arrived Friday, Aug. 2, at the agency's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and is now perched in a cleanroom to begin final preparations for its November launch.
The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft is undergoing detailed testing and fueling prior to being moved to its launch pad. The mission has a 20-day launch period that opens Nov. 18.
The spacecraft will conduct the first mission dedicated to surveying the upper atmosphere of Mars. Scientists expect to obtain unprecedented data that will help them understand how the loss of atmospheric gas to space may have played a part in changing the planet's climate.
"We're excited and proud to ship the spacecraft right on schedule," said David Mitchell, MAVEN project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. "But more critical milestones lie ahead before we accomplish our mission of collecting science data from Mars. I firmly believe the team is up to the task. Now we begin the final push to launch."
Over the weekend, the team confirmed the spacecraft arrived in good condition. They removed the spacecraft from the shipping container and secured it to a rotation fixture in the cleanroom. In the next week, the team will reassemble components previously removed for transport. Further checks prior to launch will include software tests, spin balance tests, and test deployments of the spacecraft's solar panels and booms.
The spacecraft was transported from Buckley Air Force Base in Aurora, Colo., on Friday, aboard a U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo plane. Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Littleton, Colo., designed and built the spacecraft and is responsible for testing, launch processing, and mission operations.
"It's always a mix of excitement and stress when you ship a spacecraft down to the launch site," said Guy Beutelschies, MAVEN program manager at Lockheed Martin. "It's similar to moving your children to college after high school graduation. You're proud of the hard work to get to this point, but you know they still need some help before they're ready to be on their own."
Previous Mars missions detected energetic solar fields and particles that could drive atmospheric gases away from Mars. Unlike Earth, Mars does not have a planet-wide magnetic field that would deflect these solar winds. As a result, these winds may have stripped away much of Mars' atmosphere.
MAVEN's data will help scientists reconstruct the planet's past climate. Scientists will use MAVEN data to project how Mars became the cold, dusty desert planet we see today. The planned one-year mission begins with the spacecraft entering the Red Planet's orbit in September 2014.
"MAVEN is not going to detect life," said Bruce Jakosky, planetary scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder and MAVEN's principal investigator. "But it will help us understand the climate history, which is the history of its habitability."
MAVEN's principal investigator is based at the University of Colorado Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics in Boulder. The university provides science instruments and leads science operations, education and public outreach.
Brad Pitt Goes Against Mother and Says Gay Marriage 'is Inevitable'
Email Print Whatsapp Menu Whatsapp Google Reddit Digg Stumbleupon Linkedin
During a recent movie screening in London Brad Pitt offered his opinion as to why he thinks his mother and conservatives are wrong when it comes to the issue of same-sex marriage, insisting that it "is inevitable."
Pitt has been a vocal supporter of President Obama as well as homosexuality and has stated before that he fully supports the legalization of same-sex marriage.
"I am an Obama supporter and I'm backing his election campaign," Pitt told reporters at the Mayfair Hotel in London during a screening of his new film "Killing Them Softly," according to The Telegraph.
"Gay marriage is inevitable. The next generation, they get it. It is just a matter of time before it becomes a reality," he added.
Pitt's comments are just the opposite of his mother's which took conservative tones regarding homosexuality- she stated that Christians should back presidential nominee Mitt Romney because of his faith and moral foundation.
"I hope all Christians give their vote prayerful consideration because voting is a sacred privilege and a serious responsibility," Jane Pitt previously wrote in an open letter to The Springfield News-Leader.
The letter was in response to an op-ed piece by Richard Stoecker which stated that Christians would not be able to vote for a Mormon or a candidate that supports abortion and homosexuality.
"I think any Christian should spend much time in prayer before refusing to vote for a family man with high morals, business experience, who is against abortion, and shares Christian conviction concerning homosexuality just because he is a Mormon," Pitt wrote in the letter.
"Any Christian who does not vote or writes in a name is casting a vote for Romney's opponent, Barack Hussein Obama – a man who sat in Jeremiah Wright's church for years, did not hold a public ceremony to mark the National Day of Prayer, and is a liberal who supports the killing of unborn babies and same-sex marriage," she added.
New shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti has described the Labour Party as a "war zone" and detailed how she received racist hate mail.
Her appointment came as part of Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet reshuffle, which saw party in-fighting continue as Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) leader John Cryer said the Islington North MP had acted in bad faith in talks over the reintroduction of elections for shadow cabinet.
Cryer, the MP for Leyton and Wanstead, said neither he nor sacked chief whip Rosie Winterton were told the shadow cabinet reshuffle was going ahead until it was underway on Wednesday (5 October).
Speaking about her appointment, which was viewed as somewhat controversial given it came just three weeks after her anti-Semitism report into the party was published and following criticism after Corbyn successfully nominated her for a peerage, the Associated Press reported Shakrabarti describing Labour as being in "a civil war".
"I think that I drew criticism the moment I joined the Labour Party. I joined a party in civil war at a time when the country was in crisis," she told Channel 4 News.
"And even if you think you are driving an ambulance into a war zone, you are going to take some flak, and that's what happened. I didn't expect, perhaps, some of the racist hate mail, often laced with misogyny, but I'm not here to whinge.
"I have had a bit of it, but nothing compared to what some young Jewish women MPs have faced. So, I sit here in solidarity with them, and I will continue to do my very best to make this party its better self, and to be a worthy opposition, which is what I think it now can be."

That's why I recommend people throw away their multivitamin and eat liver instead. You can search for high-quality pastured meat at EatWild.com, and if you live in the United States, you can order high-quality, grass-fed beef liver through US Wellness Meats and get shipped right to your house. And the great thing about organ meats such as liver is that they're much cheaper than muscle meat. So you actually save money by purchasing the healthiest part of the animal.
And if you can't find high-quality grass-fed liver in your area or don't like the taste of liver, I recommend raw beef liver powder in capsule form by Perfect Supplements. Their supplement contains organic beef liver from free range cows that feed exclusively on grass. You can get it through their website. I can't stand the taste of liver, so I take 4 capsules every day. I've seen an increase in my energy levels since I started taking them.
Some people object to eating liver, as they believe the liver filters and stores toxins in the body. But the liver doesn't store toxins. It neutralizes them, and then they are flushed out of the body. Toxins that the body can't eliminate often accumulate in the fat of the animal, not the liver. That's why I recommend eating lean meats if you aren't eating organic, grass-fed meats. You don't really want to be eating the fat (or organs) of sick, conventional animals.
Another objection is that it contains animal fat and cholesterol. But as I've discussed before, saturated fat and cholesterol are not bad for your health. This is a huge myth.
Other than liver, you can also try incorporating other organs into your diet, including beef kidney, tongue, heart and even brain into your diet.
That's right, brain.
Some traditional cultures believe “like supports like” and eating the organs of a healthy animal supports the organs of the eater. So it's possible that eating the brains of healthy animals could support the health of your own brain. And this would make sense since cow brain is full of healthy omega-3 fats and B12, which help fight depression, fatigue and cognitive decline.
I haven't tried eating cow brain before. And I really don't think I'd enjoy it. But I did just find a supplement that contains grass-fed cow brain. As weird as it is, I'm very curious and I think I'll just have to try it. Stay tuned, I'll report back. :)
Conclusion
Nutrient-based medical treatments used to be the norm. Unfortunately, the general public is now convinced that pharmaceutical medicine is their only option.
But it's not.
Food-based interventions work and they helped me get better.
And despite all the research demonstrating the powerful medicinal properties of these foods, the pharmaceutical industry and conventional medicine seem to ignore them.
They're found in millions of kitchens around the world, so they lack exclusivity and therefore profitability.
They threaten the status quo and pharmaceutical industry revenue.
Unless they can be transformed into patented substances, the pharmaceutical industry doesn't have a financial incentive to research and promote them to physicians.
Unless an investor is willing to pay millions of dollars upfront to pay for multi-phased, double-blind, randomized control trials, they will never be approved for clinical practice and prescribed by your doctor.
You don't have to wait around for all of this to happen. You can take control of your own brain health and try them yourself:
Shares of Google (GOOG) are getting taken behind the woodshed this afternoon after the company's third quarter earnings results were released about four hours earlier than expected. In what is being called an "unfinished earnings release" Google reported earnings of $9.03 per share on revenues of $11.3 billion. The Street had been expecting EPS of $10.65 on revenues of $11.8 billion.
Shares fell immediately on the news, dropping nearly $70 within moments before to being halted at $687.39, down $68.10 or 9%. Google is blaming RR Donnelley (RRD), the owners of corporate reporting system EDGAR, for filing their 8K without authorization. Shares of RRD fell as much as 7% before recovering slightly.
Information thus far is limited. What can be seen immediately is that Google laid off a significant number of employees in its Motorola Mobility division, lost traction on the critical Cost per Click metric, and apparently failed to find a way to monetize mobile users. Net margins also fell sharply to 27% of revenues compared to 37% last year.
Revenues from the Motorola division were $2.6 billion or 18% of Google's total revenue. Operation losses from the newly acquired company were $527 million total and $151 million on an operating basis.
The Street is anxiously awaiting further information expected to come at 4:30pm est during the company's scheduled earnings call.

I'm not sure where I stole the idea from, but I am a big proponent of printing out good advice and putting it right in front of your desk, or wherever you work everyday. So you cannot run from the advice, so you see it enough times that it becomes imprinted in your mind.
The first quote I ever did this for was an admonishment from Marcus Aurelius' Meditations. I was 19 years old and it was exactly what I needed to be told.
At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work–as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I'm going to do what I was born for–the things which I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?”
–But it's nicer here…
So you were born to feel ‘nice?' Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Why aren't you running to do what your nature demands?
–But we have to sleep sometime…
Agreed. But nature set a limit on that–as it did on eating and drinking. And you're over the limit. But not of working. There you're still below your quota. You don't love yourself enough. Or you'd love your nature too and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash and eat.
At the time, it was how I reminded myself to get off my ass, to stop being lazy, and to work hard. I'm sure if you recall back to your college days you can relate–not wanting to get up for class, the first time in your life no one could tell you what to do. It was so much nicer to blow everything off.
This advice helped me. I had that exact conversation with myself many morning–and that was possible because I'd memorized the script.
But one day a few years later, I realized: This is not my problem anymore. This is not what I need to be reminded about. And that's when the rotation began.
I remember which came next. It was something Robert Greene said to me over lunch. I was working full time at American Apparel but planning my next move, saving my money and thinking about writing a book. He told me, Ryan while people wait for the right moment, there are two types of time: Dead time—where they are passive and biding and Alive time—where they are learning and acting and getting the most out of every second. Which will this be for you?
That went right up on the wall: “Alive Time vs Dead Time”
When I caught myself sitting on my hands or goofing off as I waited, that jolted me back into line. When I got distracted with silly politics or wanderlust, I came back to it. It helped me make the most of my time as I was preparing for my next move. Even now I think of it when I get complacent. But eventually, I internalized it and could move on.
Today, I have three quotes printed and framed above my desk. Well, technically on the side of my desk right now because I built it into a closet, but I stare at them everyday.
One of these dates back to New Orleans (taped to a window in the tiny room of the old mansion we lived in), another to my time in New York (where I hung them on the wall by the desk under the loft bed) and now one came from my time in Austin (as I said, to the left of the desk on the closet wall).
One reminds me about how to live, one reminds me what to think about as a businessman and entrepreneur, the other reminds me what to think as a writer. At different times they have meant different things to me but they are reminders I need always. You'll see from the photos that they are nothing fancy. Index cards, tape and a frame from WalMart, actually.
Quote #1:
“Some lack the fickleness to live as they wish and just live as they have begun.” -Seneca
The line from Seneca is in line with my theory on dropping out. It's from his excellent essay On The Shortness of Life. The point is, sometimes you have to quit. Just because you started something, just because you're good at something, doesn't mean you must continue. Sometimes you have to make hard right turns. Fickleness is a good thing. It means you're being picky with your time. Life is too short to be anything but.
Quote # 2:
“A sustained interest, a constant variety, a consummate blend of humor and pathos, of narrative and argument, of description and declamation; while every part is subordinated to the purpose of the whole, and combines, despite its intricacy of deal, to form a dramatic and coherent unit.” H. Grose Hodge.
The line is a quote about one of Cicero's great speeches from his translator the Loeb/Harvard series. Cicero's defense of Cluentius (accused of parricide) checks about every box that a writer or a speaker must check and Hodge's description provides a pithy summary of the duties of a writer. I printed this quote out when I was struggling with my first book and trying to figure out the tone and voice I needed to be successful. I still think of it often because it reminds me, as a writer, how to regard my audience, how to think about my style and my approach. This stays on the wall because I'm not sure I'll ever really master it.
Quote # 3:
In today's global economy here is what is scarce:
1. Quality land and natural resources
2. Intellectual property, or good ideas about what should be produced.
3. Quality labor with unique skills
Here is what is not scarce these days:
1. Unskilled labor, as more countries join the global economy
2. Money in the bank or held in government securities, which you can think of as simple capital, not attached to any special ownership rights (we know there is a lot of it because it has been earning zero or negative real rates of return).”
-Tyler Cowen, Average Is Over
The line from Tyler Cowen is a new one, but it makes me both optimistic and on guard for the future. It comes from one of my favorite books of 2013. I know that I am primed and poised to obtain some of the scarce resources Cowen discusses. Others? I'm not so sure. So I need to see this to remind me to get working.
These quotes are a little peculiar, I know. They have saved me countless troubles, helped me with untold opportunities.
I'm sure as time goes by, these quotes will change. The one about writing is already showing signs of wear—literally and figuratively. I hope to one day earn the opportunity to upgrade to different advice. Something that pushes me to apply myself in different ways and improve my craft. Thankfully, I have a book of quotes to choose from.
But so far nothing has struck me. Choosing the right quote for your desk is very much an inspired-moment-stars-aligned-epiphany kind of thing. You're reading a book or talking with someone and BAM it hits you…that's exactly what I needed to hear, you think. Or, I believe that thing to be true in my very soul. And so you take the step to memorialize it.
What quotes make sense for your? No one can say. But choose wisely–not what you want to hear but what you need to hear. And maybe it doesn't need to be on your desk. Perhaps your nightstand, your bathroom mirror or tattooed on your body.
The point is: find the advice you need and put it where you will see it. Then listen to it.
It has been officially confirmed that AMD's upcoming Fiji GPU will be the world's first to feature stacked High Bandwidth Memory. Technically speaking, two pieces of information have officially been confirmed today. The first being that AMD's upcoming flagship GPU is called Fiji. The second is that not only will Fiji feature stacked High Bandwidth memory, something which we had pointed out in our deep dive article on HBM seven months ago, but that it will also be the world's first GPU to do so.
This confirmation manifested via the revelation of HotChips 2016's schedule. Which includes a presentation titled “Fiji, The World's First Graphics Processor With 2.5D High Bandwidth Memory”. Conducting the presentation will be AMD's Joe Macri and Raja Koduri both of whom are big AMD GPU veteran engineers who were responsible for crafting AMD's and before then ATi's GPU architectures. Joining them will also be Mike Mantor and Bryan Black AMD's head of the die stacking program, who talked about this technology back in 2012.
I should explain that HotChips is an annual event that's held in August of every year in which a great number of companies, including AMD, Nvidia and Intel come forth to present a deep and detailed overview of their most recently launched products. The actual timing of the presentation does not correlate with the product launch date. The actual announcement should occur sometime before the presentation. In previous HotChips presentations AMD only discussed products which have already been announced prior to the event.
AMD Fiji, The World's First GPU To Feature Stacked HBM – Finally And Officially Confirmed
Fiji will be AMD's upcoming flagship GPU that is set to power the next generation Radeon flagship graphics cards. Last week we reported that HBM production is ramping up for the upcoming Radeon flagship. And prior to that we had AMD stating that they'll publicly talk about the new GPUs sometime later this quarter, likely at Computex in June. So that's likely when we'll have an official reveal of the new R 300 series.
HBM represents the revolutionary step that has been so badly needed in the evolution of memory standards. The first generation of HBM promises to deliver 4.5X the bandwidth of GDDR5 and a staggering 16 times the bandwidth of DDR3.
Note that single channel DDR3 controllers normally have 32bit wide I/O. Leading to 8GB/s bandwidth. But that number is still eclipsed by the 128 GB/s figure for first generation HBM.
The second generation promises to double the bandwidth by doubling the speed from 1Gbps to 2Gbps. While also quadrupling the memory capacity for 4-Hi stacks from 1GB to 4GB. HBM2 will be featured in AMD's upcoming Arctic Islands graphics architecture with the “Greenland” flagship GPU.

Malaysian group pay £400M for site, ruining Chelsea's new stadium plans
BATTERSEA POWER station has been sold to Malaysian developers SP Setia and Sime Darby in a £400 million deal that could help create 25,000 jobs.
Following the outline of the most recent failed regeneration scheme, SP Setia and Sime Darby's plans for the 40 acre site include the iconic chimneys, 3,400 homes, plenty of shops and a new Northern Line Tube station.
But what might be good news for south London is bad news for Chelsea FC, which failed in its own bid for the site. The Champions League winners had planned to put up a 60,000 capacity stadia, but were evidently outbid by SP Setia and Sime Darby.
"We're making tremendous progress towards transforming this old industrial stretch of the South Bank which will provide up to 25,000 new jobs for London," said Wandsworth Council leader Ravi Govindia.
"It's important that this site and its iconic building are not left behind and that a developer is brought in who understands our vision for the new Nine Elms."
What do you think should be built on the Battersea Power Station site?

Playing the Social Game
As artists became more active on social media, installed the apps on their phones, and started tweeting and instagram'ing throughout their days, the tone of things seemed to change. Many artists became what they posted on their socials. They assumed identities, they lost their identities, and they made up imaginary identities as part of their strategy for success. Artists were judged based on these online identities, and some fans began expressing these judgements and gravitating more to artists whose online personalities they favored. As these social media sites gained popularity, there was a sense that part of the general public was focusing more on the personality and image of an artist than the actual music the artist made.
Statistically, a majority of music fans who use Facebook, Twitter and Instagram do so on their phones, as opposed to laptops or personal computers. People are reading, looking, typing, and seeing a barrage of text and images; but when it comes to cell phones and social media, they aren't doing much listening. Sure, some avid music fans hook up headphones and actually click the link to the song in their Facebook feed. But most don't. Instead, cell phone users look for stimulation through these short bursts of images and texts and social interaction, that worldwide conversation that social media allows everybody to be a part of. The switch from computers to mobile as a way of using social media helped shift the focus even more from audio to visual.
Two of the most successful traits of an artist on social media, aside from being highly active, seem to be likability and sociability. The likable artist is the one you want to get a drink with, the one that seems down to earth and humble. They don't get in beefs and they interact well with other artists and their fans. Some artists really are likable, and some played the role very well, but the fans had no way to tell the difference. So for the most part, whoever acts likable on social media is assumed likable in real life.
This has hurt some careers and helped others—some artists have trouble keeping their cool online and become less likable to their fans, some are just genuinely likable, and some play the part very well. Sociability, in this case refers to the way in which an artist interacts with other artists on social media. It can be a huge attribute and end up benefiting their career greatly.
Twitter created the most open and useful communication forum
between artist and artist.
Some artists formed bonds with their musical idols, many contacts and collaborations were made, artists were able to give each other praise for their work, and everybody got to watch it happen in real time. However, a darker side of this trend emerged: artists strategically interacting with other artists in attempts to boost their own careers. Of course musicians and entertainers have been doing this long before the internet, but social media took it to a new level.
Urban Dictionary had a term and definition for this which seems to be the only possible way to describe it.
Dick Riding: “Becoming infatuated with, endorsing, or kissing up to someone or something which is very popular at the moment in hopes of gaining recognition, a sense of fulfillment, or publicity.”
Some artists adopted a technique of subtle “dick riding” (and some not-so-subtle) in an attempt to bolster themselves up to the level of those who were in a position higher than them. And as this all took place on Twitter, the whole world (and the music industry; agents, promoters, managers, record labels) got to watch it. Those who played the game and played it well often found themselves closing the gap between them and their idols, as a sense of online kinship between two artists seemed to convey “equality.” Some strategic artists found ways to exploit this, and as they positioned themselves as equals on Twitter with their idols or rivals they suddenly found themselves as equals on stage, in billing, and in overall profile or earning power.
This item first appeared in Canadian Business.
For the first time since 1997, today saw the release of the sixth consecutive U.S. jobs market report with a net monthly employment gain of over 200,000 persons. But are they doing better than Canada, and if so, by how much?
The difficulty with direct U.S. to Canadian employment comparisons is the differences in size of the two countries. We can account for this difference by measuring employment growth relatively to the overall level of employment in each country. Here is year-over-year employment growth for Canada and the U.S. as a percentage of the overall level of employment since January 2010.
The U.S. employment market was dreadful in 2010, but has improved steadily since then. The scale required to show the 2010 numbers makes it difficult to see the relative differences in the last few years, so here is the same data starting at January 2011:
By this metric, U.S. employment growth outpaced Canadian growth in 2012 and 2014. The two countries were relatively even in 2013 outside of two bad months (February and October) for the United States.
The above charts treat full-time and part-time jobs equivalently. If we instead limit the discussion to full-time employment, the U.S. record is even stronger.
The United States has outperformed Canada by this metric in 23 of the 30 months from January 2012 to June 2014 (the Canadian July 2014 data has yet to be released), with the U.S. averaging 1.34 per cent growth relative to Canada's 0.97 per cent. Full-time employment has grown by 2.3 million in the last year—64 times Canada's paltry 35,600 net gain. Given Canada's performance gap over the past two-and-a-half years, it is getting more and more difficult to claim that Canada “strongest job-creation record in the G7.”
NEW DELHI: The EPFO (Employees' Provident Fund Organization ), which manages lifetime savings of 6.15 crore individuals, has just made life tougher for workers. Employees will now have to prove that their employers deducted the statutory dues while giving them salaries, a move that will further benefit construction companies and contractors in particular who often claim that they have paid salaries to thousands of workers without actually transferring it.What is going to add to the woes is EPFO's decision to limit investigations into allegations of default only if it is for the past seven years. "It has been observed that open-ended assessment, inquiries and investigations serve no real purpose. Moreover, such inquiries often do not result in the identification of beneficiaries and only tend to harass the employers and establishments. It is accordingly directed that no inquiry or probe shall ordinarily go beyond seven years that is, it shall cover the period of default not exceeding preceding seven financial years. It is to be ensured that compliance actions are initiated in time and there is normally no reason for extending the scope of investigation and assessment inquiry beyond previous seven financial years," central PF commissioner R C Mishra said in a circular issued on November 30, the day he superannuated.While trade unions are protesting against the move, the same six-page circular also has a clause on lump-sum assessments dealing with establishments that hire "workers of migratory nature" on short-term project-based employment, a reference largely to the construction and real estate sector.In this case, EPFO has mandated specific returns to be filed but has also mentioned that "no assessment shall be made without identifying individual members in whose account the fund is to be credited".They pointed to at least 20 raids conducted by EPFO's central squad in the Capital and NCR and irregularities were detected. "Evasion of PF dues is a common problem in labour-intensive sectors where employers show fewer workers than the actual number engaged in order to evade their PF amounts. So far, assessments were based on extensive examination of accounts which allowed recovery of PF contributions even if the attendance records were destroyed or not submitted by the companies for inspection. But it is now possible for a company to destroy employment records and claim immunity from PF liability as authorities are now saddled with the additional Officials in the agency admitted that the new directive will make it tough for workers to claim dues as they often do not have their PF account numbers although their employers would have shown in the records that salaries have been paid.Under the law, entities employing over 20 workers have to mandatorily deduct 12.5% of the salary and transfer it to EPFO for provident fund and pension schemes.Trade unions have raised the red flag against the move to limit the investigation period as they see the scales tilting in favour of defaulters of EPFO that manages assets to the tune of Rs 5.80 lakh crore."This circular is anti-worker. The law of limitation does not apply on us and does not stand the test of law as there are several Supreme Court rulings on the issue," said A D Nagpal, Hind Mazdoor Sabha secretary and a trustee on the EPFO board.Nagpal said that fearing action, employees often do not complain against their employer till they leave service and the new provision will make it impossible for them to claim what is due to them."It is not proper to have a time limit for what is an employee's right," added Citu president A K Padmanabhan, who is also on the EPFO board. He said the EPF statement usually does not reach employees on time and very few actually check the balance and deposits carefully.Even before the circular was issued, there were protests within EPFO over the move. Sources said some of the members of a committee of officers on judicial proceedings had opted out from giving their recommendations as they recognized that the move was not employee-friendly. Yet, Mishra went ahead and issued the directive.TIMES VIEWIn a country which has precious little by way of a social safety net, the provident fund is one of the few such fallback options, even if only for those in the organized labour force. Any change in the rules governing this scheme must therefore be tested on the touchstone of whether it enhances the safety net or weakens it. Imposing a time limitation on when defaults can be investigated clearly weakens it. Most of those whose savings lie in the EPF do not regularly track whether money is being deposited in it by their employers and, if so, whether it is as much as it should be. They may well discover a default well after it happens. Clearly, they cannot be left with no scope for redress due to a time limitation clause.
A new $1.1 billion Chargers stadium could be funded with an array of revenue sources including large contributions from the team, the NFL, taxpayers and fans attending games, according to a proposal released Monday.
The 42-page financing plan, created by Mayor Kevin Faulconer's stadium task force, includes $200 million from the NFL, $300 million from the Chargers and $173 million in bonds secured by future rent from the Chargers.
County and city taxpayers would contribute $121 million each, but no tax increases would be required because the money would come from each agency's general fund over a 30-year period.
In addition, the city would sell 75 acres of the 166-acre Qualcomm Stadium site to a developer for an estimated $225 million. But the plan doesn't rely on any revenue from whatever project is eventually built on the land.
Fans would contribute by paying ticket and parking surcharges that would generate $111 million over 30 years and by purchasing an estimated $120 million in personal seat licenses, which would allow them to secure season tickets for specific seats.
Another revenue source could be rent increases for the San Diego State Aztecs football team, the Holiday Bowl and the Poinsettia Bowl. The task force said those increases would yield an estimated $43 million over 30 years.
The proposal includes $242 million in public money and $225 million in public land, or $467 million in total public contributions.
How one counts the rent, ticket and parking revenues is already fueling the debate over whether the cost is mostly borne by public funds or private monies. If those revenues are considered as income to the city and county, then public funds would account for the majority of the stadium financing. However, if regarded as a cost to the team, then private money would comprise the majority.
“We believe the plan we've developed is fair for everybody — the city, the county, the taxpayers and the team,” said task force chairman Adam Day, estimating that a new stadium would increase the team's revenue $25 million per year.
The revenue proposals would generate a combined $1.4 billion, nearly $300 million more than the task force estimates the stadium would cost.
That surplus could provide the necessary wiggle room when the team and consultants hired recently by the city and county begin negotiating a possible deal to keep the Chargers from moving to Los Angeles by building a new stadium here.
“This is not a perfect plan — I don't expect that either the city or the team will accept it 100 percent,” Day said. “But I think it's an excellent starting point. It's a solid foundation for future negotiations”
He said construction would begin no later than 2018 and that the stadium could open for the 2020 season.
Because there are no tax increases, no public vote would be required. And the task force, officially known as the Citizens Stadium Advisory Group, is not recommending such a vote.
However, the Chargers, along with city and county officials, have previously said they want a public vote even if one isn't legally required.
Mayor Faulconer said Monday afternoon that he still considers a vote essential.
“I've always believed San Diegans should weigh in on this and have their say,” Faulconer said. “It's the right thing to do and I'm confident San Diegans will support it if the plan makes sense, just like they did when we had Petco Park on the ballot.”
It's not clear whether the plan will receive the necessary support from the Chargers. Mark Fabiani, the team's special counsel, said in a brief statement Monday afternoon only that the proposal would be thoroughly analyzed.
“We are grateful to the CSAG members who volunteered their time, and we will now ask our stadium development team — including our financing, legal and land use experts — to thoroughly review the CSAG results,” Fabiani said.
Day said the Chargers might be concerned by the plan recommending fans pay surcharges of $5 per ticket and $3 to park at each game, and by the recommended $300 million cash contribution, which is $100 million more than the team has previously offered.
Would you pay ticket and parking surcharges to help fund the Chargers stadium? No 43% (1827) Yes 57% (2439) 4266 total votes.
But Day said that increase was warranted by the estimated construction costs for the stadium essentially tripling since the Chargers first offered $200 million more than 10 years ago.
“We believe it's fair that the team share in the increased costs,” he said.
The Chargers would be reimbursed for much of their cash contribution with half of the revenue from seat licenses — $60 million — and as much as $185 million in naming rights for the stadium.
The team's rent would start at $10 million per year and increase 3 percent each year, which would amount to more than $470 million at the end of the 30-year term. But discounted back to today's dollars after taking into account inflation over time, the figure would be $173 million, the task force explained.
Instead of collecting that money from the Chargers over 30 years, the task force recommends the city and county generate an estimated $173 million for stadium construction by selling bonds that they would steadily pay back with the lease revenue.
The San Diego County Taxpayers Association declined on Monday to take a position on the proposal, saying the group needs more time to analyze it.
"We're pleased they're finished with their work, and it now gives us an opportunity to analyze an actual recommendation, where before it's been hypothetical,” said W. Mark Leslie, the association's chief executive.
Leslie said he was concerned that while the proposal includes no tax increases, there are “obviously” taxpayer funds involved and public land involved.
Mayor Faulconer praised the task force on Monday afternoon.

“San Diego has a framework to build a new stadium that's tangible, that's achievable and that won't raise taxes,” he said, adding that he'd like to begin negotiations with the team by June 1. “Now we have some great options that we will be reviewing.”
City Attorney Jan Goldsmith said he was confident the consultants — financial firm Citigroup and attorneys Nixon-Peabody — would be ready to begin meeting with the Chargers on June 1.
He also praised the task force proposal for its high level of detail. Goldmsith said, however, that some of the proposals face potential legal or environmental hurdles.
“It's nothing that we haven't reviewed and it's nothing we think is insurmountable,” said Goldsmith, noting that his staff and the consultants began reviewing some of the issues before the report was issued on Monday.
The task force proposal suggests the Chargers expedite environmental approvals for the stadium by funding a petition campaign similar to the one they sponsored recently in Carson, a Los Angeles suburb where the Chargers and Raiders have proposed a joint stadium.
Under the proposal, enough valid signatures would be presented to the City Council so they could approve the stadium before pivotal NFL meetings scheduled for October.
Meanwhile, the Chargers and Raiders have hired Carmen Policy to spearhead the relocation and $1.7 billion Carson stadium project, according to the Los Angeles Times. Policy was previously president of the San Francisco 49ers and Cleveland Browns.
Day said the proposed San Diego stadium would cost less than some other NFL stadiums built in recent years, partly because it would be less elaborate than those. In addition, San Diego's mild climate allowed the task force to recommend a canopy instead of a roof, which would yield $150 million in savings.
The stadium would include 65,000 seats but could be expanded for special events to 72,000, the minimum required to host a Super Bowl. It would also include a 12,000-spot parking garage, 5,500 fewer spots than the 17,500 now available at Qualcomm Stadium.
The $1.1 billion cost includes $950 million for the stadium itself, $144 million for the parking garage and $60 million to demolish the old stadium and complete some infrastructure and utilities work.
It doesn't include the costs for new freeway on-ramps or other upgrades that may be required for the development of the 75 acres the city would sell.
Those upgrades could be funded by a new state economic development tool called an enhanced infrastructure district.
While Day stressed that the proposal doesn't rely on revenue from developing those acres, the task force did analyze what kind of project might be created there.
They suggested a “low to mid-rise mixed-use village” with 3,300 housing units, more than 1 million square feet of commercial space and a 500-room hotel that could generate transient-occupancy tax to help pay for infrastructure.
The $225 million estimate for the 75 acres of city-owned land was based in part on information provided by the San Diego Building Industry Association, which consulted with its developer and builder members, said Chief Executive Borre Winckel.
The association valued the land at $2 million to $3 million an acre, after taking into consideration the costs associated with developing that property, including securing zoning changes from the city.
“The valuation assumes that the city does come through with the appropriate zoning,” he said. “This is an extremely rudimentary value we gave them. There probably would be a great level of interest in this because it's a prime piece of land and a very attractive location between the freeways and near downtown.”
San Diego State spokesman Greg Block would not comment on the recommendation to increase the university's yearly stadium rent, other than to say “we look forward to talking further with the city about that.”
Block said the university's annual payments to the city currently total roughly $500,000, the majority of which covers the city's costs associated with each game, such as custodial and police services and utilities. Included in the $500,000 is $1 from each ticket sold, which totals an estimated $120,000.
The task force proposal would increase SDSU's rent to $1.25 million per year.
Fan groups generally embraced the proposal on Monday, but there was some concern about the ticket and parking surcharges and the personal seat licenses.
“The overall feedback we're getting is positive,” said Sean Farrell, leader of the “You Know You're a Charger Fan When” Facebook page. “It's the most positive event in 13 years.”
Rafael Alvarez, 50, of the Bolt Pride fan group, said he doesn't know how much he would be willing to pay for a personal seat license, but so far has handled numerous ticket price increases since he first got his season seats in 1992.
“I went in when they were $50 or so a seat per game and I'm still here and they more than doubled,” he said. “I think when the time comes we'll look at it and we'll say you know what, in my priorities, with my financial situation, yes I can do that, I can commit, and there is going to be a breaking point, I'm not going to deny it.”
Johnny Abundez, 35, of Chula Vista, who's been going to games since 1989, said he would pony up for a seat license if he could do a 10-year financing plan spelled out in a survey the NFL sent to Chargers fans earlier this year.
“It's an investment, I mean I'd rather go to the stadium than go to a bar,” he said. “How much do we spend going out to eat at expensive restaurants compared to cooking at home and buying at Costco wholesale?”
Bryon Moore, who pays about $200 per game for season seats on the club level, said a seat license would cause him to downgrade his tickets one level, but it would be worthwhile.
“I watched that stadium get built as a little boy and the memories growing up there with Tony Gwynn and Junior Seau and Dan Fouts and Air Coryell and tailgating with my grandfather … the earliest memories of my life have been built around the stadium.”

Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore (R) doubled down Sunday on his decision to ignore a federal ruling allowing same-sex marriage in the state, while one of the probate judges defying him expressed confidence that he was "on the right side of history."
Despite Moore's orders to the contrary, at least 50 of Alabama's 67 counties decided by Friday to issue licenses to same-sex couples.
"When federal law is in conflict with state law, federal law wins out," President Barack Obama said last week in an interview with BuzzFeed, adding, "I think the courts at the federal level will have something to say to him."
But Moore, who has repeatedly compared the decision to allow same-sex marriage to the 1896 Supreme Court decision allowing racial segregation, told Fox News' Chris Wallace that those judges are breaking Alabama's constitution. He also took on Obama, arguing that "what this Harvard professor who is president of our United States does not understand is that a trial court's decision on the constitutionality of a federal question is just that, it's an opinion."
"This is not the first time you have run up against the federal courts," Wallace told Moore. "Back in 2003, you ignored a U.S. federal court of appeals ruling that you must remove a 2-ton granite monument of the Ten Commandments from the state capitol. At that point, sir, in Alabama, a state ethics panel said you had to be removed from office because you had put yourself above the law. Aren't you doing the same thing now, sir?"
Moore responded by hinting at the possibility of future judicial activism. "I was obeying the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, which does not prohibit the acknowledgement of God," he said. "When federal courts start changing our Constitution by defining words that are not even there, like marriage, they're going to do the same thing with family in the future."
In a separate interview on Sunday, Judge Steven L. Reed, the first probate judge in the state to publicly announce he would issue same-sex marriage licenses, said he "didn't ask for [Moore's] opinion and frankly didn't need it. The federal judge told us what we needed to do, and to me that was as clear-cut as I needed in order to make a decision."
Reed said on CNN's "State of the Union" that he wasn't bothered that same-sex marriage remains unpopular in Alabama, and called Moore's decision "a desperate attempt to defy the federal government."
Australia's Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman Simon Cohen says the agency can do little to help subscribers dealing with broken National Broadband Network (NBN) installations.
While the agency can flag complaints with NBN Co, the entity building and operating the NBN, it appears unable to do anything to force the utility to fix botched fibre connections referred to under the blanket term 'core network shortfall'.
Instead the office registers a fault against the retail service provider, or ISP, regardless of whether that telco was at fault. The internet providers can then do little but pester a seemingly unresponsive NBN Co for restoration updates.
“Where an area is listed as NBN-ready, but there is insufficient infrastructure that prevents a connection to a specific address (known as a network shortfall), the TIO does not have the power to direct a provider to install the missing infrastructure,” Cohen says.
“Consumers can raise issues about incomplete infrastructure in NBN-ready areas with NBN Co or with the Department of Communications.”
“When the TIO receives a complaint about a delay to an NBN service connection, we usually record it against the retail provider that has the contract with the consumer.”
The office could flag with NBN Co damage to property resulting from installations. Consumers could approach Telstra for a voice service where one did not exist under the Universal Service Obligation, but were out of luck for internet services.
“The universal service obligation (USO)does not apply to internet services and consumers who require an internet service only may need to explore options such as mobile or fixed wireless,” Cohen says.
These difficulties came to light after Melbourne security bod Liam O, who requested El Reg alter his name, was denied access to fixed line broadband over copper when NBN Co incorrectly chalked up his apartment complex as connected to its fibre-to-the-premises network.
The IT security professional has been unable to work from home for the four months after he first requested an NBN connection.
He says NBN Co has not provided an estimated time to fix what appears as a botched contractor installation job that has prevented his and nine other units in his Brunswick apartment from receiving any fixed line internet connection.
NBN Co letters sent to Liam O recommending connections be requested before copper is ripped out.
After multiple phone calls between NBN Co, Liam O and his preferred retailer Internode, Liam O has learned that his apartment block was subject to a 'core network shortfall' with no estimated time for a fix.
NBN Co has not responded to multiple requests by The Register, made with with Liam O's permission. to source information on the case. Nor have wee been advised of information on recourse options available to affected consumers.
Under NBN arrangements Liam O and others in his apartment cannot access copper last mile since NBN Co considers the block connected, rendering them cut off from all terrestrial telecommunications options.
The Australian Communications and Media Authority told Liam O in an email seen by El Reg that consumers without telephone access could apply for a reduced-rate mobile or satellite phone, but would have to call the Department of Communications to query the fixed-line connection.
The copper last mile, since deactivated, is scheduled to be ripped out from MR O's neighbourhood.
Liam O says a separate contractor who installed connections within Multi Dwelling Units claimed the shortfalls are a common source of frustration with residents.
It is unknown how many consumers are affected by core network shortfalls which can encompass a variety of faults from architectural variance to Liam O's apparent contractor stuff-up.
Telco forum Whirlpool is littered with cases of consumers issued with bland core network shortfall notices, with some enduring multiple missed estimate resolution times blowing out to six weeks. ®

Welcome to React Tutorials
React.js is a JavaScript library for crafting fast user interfaces on the front end. This tutorial website was created to supplement official React documentation with a set of short and easy to understand tutorials.
React is simple to use but it's tied to a vast number of software development concepts. You can progress through React tutorials on this site in sequential order. Just follow the main menu on the left hand side navigation bar.
React Elements
React Element is the building block of a React application. Looking to get started quick? If so you can learn How to create React Elements in this quick beginner's tutorial.
You can aid creation process of react elements syntactically with JSX in which case you will write HTML tags as part of JavaScript statements. As unusual as that sounds at first, with practice it becomes second nature.
If you're just starting out this React Elements: Getting Started will lead you to the right trail. Many tutorials start out with react components, which are just reacted elements in sheep's clothing. The two can be referred to interchangeably.
React Components
If React Elements help you construct your HTML as a JavaScript statement (whether you are using JSX or not the principle is the same) then React Components take this concept one notch further.
React Components are JavaScript classes you can inherit and instantiate. Extending a component is nothing more than deriving your own custom class from it (by using "extend" keyword).
The main class for creating components is React.Component. It's what you will derive your own custom classes such as "to-do" lists, shopping cart items or a grid cell in a board game, for example. It depends on what you are trying to create.
React Components give you ability to add your UI elements to the Virtual DOM. A which point your component will not yet be visible on the screen. Once you Create a React Component, you are ready to "render" it by passing it as first argument of the ReactDOM.render method. Doing that will "mount" your element to the actual JavaScript DOM, making it physically appear on the page.

- New analytical techniques have revealed that the scale of bushmeat trade in Central Africa may be much larger than originally thought, according to a study published today by TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network.The study, based on an analysis of food balance sheets provided by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization's statistical database FAOSTAT, strongly supports the view that the current situation surrounding bushmeat hunting in Central African rainforests is precarious. According to the analysis, bushmeat extraction rose considerably in the Congo Basin between 1990 and 2005, despite the overall decrease in forest cover in Central Africa.Cameroon appears to be exceeding—by more than 100%—an estimated sustainable offtake of 150 kg of game meat per square kilometre of forest, and Gabon and the Republic of Congo are both close to this limit. The greatest rise in bushmeat production was in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the yield rose from 78,000 tonnes in 1990 to 90,000 tonnes in 2005. In the Republic of Congo, production almost doubled, from 11,000 to 20,000 tonnes per year in the same time period.“While the FAOSTAT bushmeat data are probably underestimates and should be regarded with caution, the data are the most readily available official sources of information on production of wild meat in the Congo Basin and are valuable indicators of bushmeat production and consumption trends,” says Stefan Ziegler, Programme Officer with WWF Germany, and author of the report.Wildlife is a significant and direct source of protein for more than 34 million people living in the Congo Basin and bushmeat hunting is a key component of many peoples' livelihoods in Central Africa.Earlier studies have demonstrated that bushmeat extraction increases with human population growth. However, the latest study finds that bushmeat consumption increases significantly with personal wealth too.“Bushmeat consumption is higher in countries with large urban populations, and the increasing urbanization in the Congo region is likely to place even greater pressure on wild animal populations there,” says Ziegler,“The danger is unsustainable offtake of wild game will lead to a collapse in wild animal populations and widespread human hunger in the region,” says Ziegler.Unsustainable harvest levels are widely believed to be the most immediate threat to the region's forest mammals.“Local people have hunted for centuries, for food and for barter, but the last 20 years have seen the emergence of a commercial bushmeat market due to rural people being increasingly drawn into the cash economy,” says Nathalie van Vliet, TRAFFIC Bushmeat Strategic Advisor.“The impacts of subsistence hunting was previously balanced by the fact of the hunting was done on a rotation basis on alternate tracts of forest areas. However, shifts in human population dynamics and socio-economic factors are leading to rising, and increasingly unsustainable demands on wild animal populations.”An earlier WCS study found that offtake by commercial hunters in south-eastern Cameroon was ten times more per immigrant hunter than for local subsistence hunters.“What is clear is that management strategies to prevent over-harvesting need to be implemented and measures put in place to provide alternative sources of protein for the inhabitants of the region.”However, the study also indicated that the development of animal husbandry may not be an ideal solution to provide substitute protein for game meat.The study, Application of food balance sheets to assess the scale of the bushmeat trade in Central Africa, was launched today at the Convention on Biological Diversity's Bushmeat Liaison Group Meeting, currently taking place in Buenos Aires, Argentina.Further to the results of the study, TRAFFIC is encouraging countries in Central Africa to enhance enforcement efforts and establish concrete law enforcement mechanisms targeted at curbing commercial bushmeat poaching. “Central African countries can cooperate in addressing this growing problem through the development of a regional enforcement plan and creating the political will to combat commercial bushmeat poaching in regional fora such as the upcoming Yaounde +10 Summits." says Germain Ngandjui, TRAFFIC's representative in Central Africa.
When San Bernardino police detectives would raid houses to search for drugs the past few years, they couldn't believe what they kept finding.
“The question started coming up, ‘Why are we seeing so much laundry detergent in so many dope houses?'” Sgt. Travis Walker said.
Strange as it may seem, detergent — specifically liquid Tide and Tide Pods — has become a currency on the black market nationwide. It is traded for drugs or sold far below retail prices at open swap meets and clandestine meetings, law enforcement and retail officials say.
Several factors have combined to turn the product into what some are calling “liquid gold”: The Tide brand is the most popular, even though it is the highest priced; detergent is relatively easy to steal and, unlike electronic items with serial numbers, is difficult to trace; and shoplifting is a relatively low-risk operation compared to other crimes to make a quick buck.

“People refer to it comically like, ‘They're stealing laundry detergent?'” said Richard Mellor, vice president of loss prevention for the National Retail Federation.
But merchants aren't laughing.
Walker said one Inland supermarket chain, which he declined to identify, reported each store suffering four to six thefts of Tide per week, with each loss valued at $100 to $400.
The Tide thefts are part of what merchants have told the National Retail Federation is an increase in organized groups stealing for resale many products that people use every day: razors, beauty supplies, allergy medicine.
The Inland Empire Organized Retail Crime Association was created by local retailers, police and prosecutors in 2011 to share information on crime trends and suspect descriptions.
‘HOT COMMODITY'
The National Retail Federation lists laundry detergent only behind baby formula as the most-stolen product.
“It's a hot commodity on the streets,” Riverside police Lt. Dan Hoxmeier said.
And no, the ingredients are not broken down to make drugs, as with some cold medicines that are frequently stolen. People actually buy the stolen Tide to wash clothes.
“Everyone uses laundry detergent,” Mellor said.
A 2009 survey listed Procter & Gamble's Tide, along with Kraft and Coca-Cola, as the three brands that consumers would never give up no matter how badly the economy tanked.
That loyalty comes at a cost: In a recent check at a Stater Bros. market in Riverside, a 150-ounce bottle of Tide was priced at $17.97, $3 more than the same amount of Gain and $7.20 more than a 150-ounce bottle of All.
Those Tide bottles can be exchanged for $5 cash or $10 worth of marijuana or crack cocaine, according to New York Magazine's “Suds for Drugs” article, which said the product has received the nickname “liquid gold.”
Sundar Raman, the marketing director of P&G's North American fabric-care division, told the magazine, “It's unfortunate that people are stealing Tide, and I don't think it's appropriate at all, but the one thing it reminds me of is that the value of the brand has stayed consistent.”
Procter & Gamble officials did not return two phone messages from The Press-Enterprise seeking comment.
GANG OF THIEVES
The scope of the problem is far beyond a single person slipping a bottle or bag of Tide under his arm and sneaking out of a supermarket, big-box store or pharmacy, and it is not limited to Tide.
Rings of thieves cost businesses $30 billion annually, the National Retail Federation estimates.
“This is not shoplifting we're talking about,” Mellor said in a phone interview from Washington, D.C. “It's a criminal enterprise to make a significant profit.”
Hoxmeier said a crew will often have three people: a target, lookout and mule. The target identifies the product to be stolen. The lookout makes sure no one is watching and loads the cart, with Tetris-like precision, with detergent, baby formula, razor blades, energy drinks, allergy medicine and beauty products. Sometimes they'll conceal the bounty with blankets and even children, Hoxmeier said.
The mule will then push the cart right out of the store.
Once obtained, the products often go to middlemen who might have furnished the thieves with shopping lists.
Riverside police Detective Dave Riedeman said some people sell the stolen items out of their homes to neighbors who learn of their availability through word of mouth.
Riedeman's partner, Detective Lori Blaszak, said stolen women's beauty products, expensive in stores, are particularly popular on the black market.
HELPING THE COMPETITION
Retailers are fighting back, short of putting Tide under lock and key.
Mellor said some merchants shrink-wrap excess inventory on shelves or otherwise make the bottles difficult to reach. Others attach electronic devices that will activate an alarm if they are not removed at the checkout stand.
Merchants, fierce competitors for the customer dollar, also have found success by working together. They compare notes and surveillance photos on who has been stealing and when and where, and forward the information to police.
“There is a collaboration like I've never seen before. It's very refreshing,” Mellor said.
Organized retail crime was a hot topic at a National Retail Federation loss-prevention conference in San Diego this month that Mellor organized. He said he was heartened to see 20 law enforcement agencies represented, including some federal agencies and police from as far away as Florida.
INLAND OPERATION
Law enforcement also is gaining awareness of the scope of the problem and is committing more resources, Mellor added.
CVS recently approached Riverside police about its theft problem, Riedeman said.
The result was an operation June 4-5 in which 28 Riverside and San Bernardino officers fanned out to 16 locations and made 38 theft arrests, including 13 for felonies.
Riedeman said the most audacious attempted theft was by a woman who loaded up her cart with car batteries and tried to wheel them out the door.
The undercover plan involved 44 retail employees at CVS, Food 4 Less, Ralphs, Rite Aid, Sam's Club, Stater Bros., Target, Toys R Us and Walmart stores. A Stater Bros. spokesman declined to discuss thefts from the markets. CVS did not return a call seeking comment.
This was the first such operation for Riverside police, Blaszak said.
“Usually we're just coming in from behind. Part of the goal is to be proactive,” she said.
The big prize was not the thieves themselves, but the identity of those, known as fences, who would have received the stolen goods, Riedeman said.
“We're going to continue to do operations like this,” Riedeman added. “Hopefully the same way the word got out that you can go out and steal whatever you want, we want to make it so you're not so comfortable that you can go out and steal.”

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) named Vijay Rupani as Gujarat's new chief minister and Nitin Patel his deputy on Friday, entrusting two of its most powerful state leaders the responsibility of reviving the party's popularity among voters.
Rupani, who takes charge on Sunday, has his job cut out. He has to placate angry Patel and Dalit communities, battle two decades of anti-incumbency and repair ties between the government and the party. And all this before the state elections that are due by December, 2017.
In choosing Rupani over Patel, who was seen as a front-runner for the top job till Thursday, the BJP hopes that his non-dominant Jain background would help neutralise caste equations in a state where the Patel and Dalit communities are crucial vote banks.
Rupani, 61, hails from Rajkot, the heartland of Saurashtra which has a significant population of both Patels and Dalits.
On the other hand, Nitin Patel enjoys significant clout in north Gujarat, which was the epicentre of last year's violent protests by the Patidar or Patels demanding quotas for the community in colleges and jobs. His appointment could help woo back the Patels, the BJP's traditional backers who had begun drifting away.
“The responsibility I have been handed is great and we are thankful for this,” Rupani said after being named the chief minister. “(I) will put in all the efforts to make Gujarat the role model of India.”
Union minister Nitin Gadkari announced the appointments after chief minister Anandiben Patel resigned earlier in the week. Friday's meeting to choose her successor was attended by party MLAs as well as BJP president Amit Shah. Rupani, seen as close to Shah, was the state transport and water supply minister and Patel the health minister.

The BJP has been in power in Gujarat for two decades but the past two years have seen the party's fortunes slide in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state.
Anandiben's two-year tenure was marked by deadly protests by the Patidars seeking quotas in colleges and jobs, and more recently, over the public beating of four Dalit men by self-styled cow protectors.
Many accused her government of being out of touch with people's aspirations, and blamed her leadership for the party's dwindling support in both rural and urban Gujarat.
The BJP's vote share in panchayat polls dropped from 50.26% in 2010 to 43.97% last year. Its hold over semi-urban and urban civic bodies also weakened during the period, helping to revive a moribund Congress party in the state.
On Friday, Anandiben proposed Rupani's name in the meet attended by 121 state BJP lawmakers.
Sources said Shah believed that replacing a Patel chief minister with a non-Patel would not go down well with the Patidar community. This led to the party settling for a new arrangement of a deputy chief minister.
In selecting Rupani, a first-time MLA, the BJP has kept up its tradition of bringing in a non-Patel leader after the untimely exit of a Patel leader. Twice, when Keshubhai Patel had to go unceremoniously without completing his terms in 1995 and 1998, the BJP's choice was from non-dominant castes -- Suresh Mehta, a Jain in 1996 and Narendra Modi, an OBC in 2001 -- to neutralise caste considerations.
This is also the first time the BJP has selected a Kadva Patel leader in Nitin Patel.
The party was forced to reconfigure its caste calculus after the Congress's successful social engineering experiment in consolidating what became known as the KHAM -- Kashtriya, Harijan, Adivasi and Muslims – votes.
At the same time, the two sects of the Patels -- Leuvas and Kadvas -- tilted toward the BJP in and brought the saffron party to the power for the first time in Gujarat in 1995.
Since then the Leuvas have dominated the party. The BJP had so far two chief ministers, including Keshubhai and Anandiben, several ministers and even party presidents from among Leuva Patels.

Hacking police find 'bombshell' emails: Now detectives may want to question James Murdoch
Grilling: Mr Murdoch was questioned for two and a half hours by a Commons select committee on Thursday
Police investigating phone-hacking at the News of the World have recovered a series of ‘bombshell' emails which they believe takes the inquiry to ‘a new level'.
The emails were among tens of thousands held by the newspaper at a data storage facility in India.
Police are believed to want to question News International chief James Murdoch and former Sun and News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks about their contents.
Discussions have taken place with the Crown Prosecution Service about whether Mr Murdoch should be arrested and interviewed under caution.
Last night it was unclear whether the emails suggest Mr Murdoch and Mrs Brooks were involved in a cover-up of phone-hacking or prove they had knowledge of malpractice at the News of the World, which was closed in July.
Both Mrs Brooks, who has already been arrested in connection with the inquiry and is on police bail, and Mr Murdoch deny any wrongdoing.
The latest twist in the case emerged 24 hours after Mr Murdoch – the son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch – was grilled for two and a half hours on Thursday by a House of Commons select committee.
In a bruising second appearance before the Culture Committee, he insisted he had not learned until recently that the practice of illegally eavesdropping on private phone messages went beyond a single ‘rogue reporter'.
Detectives on Operation Weeting, the Scotland Yard squad investigating phone-hacking, took a detailed note of his comments.
His testimony will be compared to the emerging email evidence in India, before he is interviewed by police.
Last night speculation was growing that the new development could be linked to the large-scale deletion of News of the World emails.
In January 2007, the News of the World's then royal editor, Clive Goodman (left), and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire were jailed for illegally intercepting voicemails
Three months ago, the technology firm HCL told the Home Affairs Committee it was aware of the deletion of hundreds of thousands of emails at the request of News International between April 2010 and July 2011, but said it did not know of anything untoward behind the requests to delete them.
HCL said it was not the company responsible for emails on the News International computer system that are older than a couple of weeks. It said another unnamed organisation was responsible, but confirmed it had co-operated with it in deleting material.
It stressed that since it was not the company that stored News International's data ‘any allegation that it has deleted material held on behalf of News International is without foundation'.
In January 2007, the News of the World's then royal editor, Clive Goodman, and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire were jailed for illegally intercepting voicemails, but News International maintained until earlier this year that they were acting alone.
While testifying on Thursday, Mr Murdoch was accused by Labour MP Tom Watson of acting like a ‘mafia boss' whose company operated ‘omerta' – a code of silence to cover up criminal behaviour.
After Mr Murdoch repeatedly denied being aware of wrongdoing within the company he has led since 2007, Mr Watson told him: ‘You must be the first mafia boss in history who didn't know he was running a criminal enterprise.'
After being threatened with a lawsuit by the Hollywood-funded anti-piracy outfit BREIN, a Dutch payment provider has handed over the personal details of a torrent site owner. The anti-piracy group is targeting payment providers in order to reveal the identity of site owners, as the information owners give to hosting companies is often false.
Hundreds of torrent sites, private BitTorrent trackers in particular, allow their users to donate money in exchange for extra features. In part, the site owners use this money to keep their sites afloat, but if it's up to anti-piracy watchdog BREIN, this type of funding will become their downfall.
Earlier this month BREIN announced that it would query payment providers such as PayPal for the personal information of account holders connected to ‘illegal' sites. BREIN threatened to take these payment providers to court if they refused to cooperate, and it now appears that they were serious.
BREIN contacted a currently unnamed payment provider for the name and address of a torrent site owner who accepted donations. Initially the company declined to cooperate, but when BREIN scheduled a court case to obtain a preliminary injunction, the payment provider eventually caved in.
In the past BREIN succeeded in obtaining the personal details of torrent site owners from hosting providers, but since these are not always accurate his outfit is always looking for additional options. Going after payment providers seems to be their next logical step.
“The name and address information that illegal sites give to hosting providers are mostly false, but luckily financial service providers are required to verify the identity of their customers,” BREIN director Tim Kuik said in a comment. “This gives us the ability to still find out the identity of managers of sites that earn money from their illegal activities.”
Although there are various concerns about this process from a privacy point of view, it appears that BREIN's request could fall within the boundaries of the law. Arnoud Engelfriet, lawyer with the Ictrecht law firm, explains that service providers may have little option than to cooperate.
“Dutch case law (in particular the Pessers/Lycos case) has held that in certain cases internet providers and other intermediaries are indeed required to hand over identifying information if a customer is likely committing a tort. A court intervention is not necessary according to our High Court,” he previously told TorrentFreak.
“The legal requirements are that it is without serious doubt that this customer is committing the tort, that releasing the identifying information is relevant for the case *and* that an evaluation of customer privacy versus the interests of the third party reveals ultimately that privacy must give way to those interests.”
In this particular case the payment provider was convinced that the actions of the torrent site were severe enough to give up the private information. One has to question though if the ‘evidence' presented by a party that has a clear stake in a dispute will be objective.
TorrentFreak asked BREIN director Tim Kuik whether he could provide more information regarding the nature of the torrent site they went after, but Kuik declined to release any additional information at this point.
What BREIN plans to do with the information they received from the payment provider is not clear either. The anti-piracy outfit has obtained this type of information from hosting companies in the past, but we're not aware of any legal action that was taken against these torrent site owners.
For now, however, BREIN is free to contact payment providers with further requests, which they have already indicated is their intention.
There was no shortage of villains during a McCain campaign conference call on energy policy Monday morning. Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, President Bush, Dick Cheney, and Jimmy Carter were all assigned various degrees of blame for the current price of fuel.
But the most unlikely recipient of mockery may have been Rep. Eric Cantor, a McCain surrogate on the candidate's VP shortlist.
Asked by a reporter to assess the failures of the Bush administration in weaning the nation off foreign oil following September 11, McCain's economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, shot back that the problem was "three decades of bipartisan failure." From there, he ripped into Obama for supporting the 2005 Energy Act, which he described as "subsidies for big oil."
"John McCain recognized that is not a path forward," said Holtz-Eakin. "He voted against that bill. We need people who understand that and not necessarily toe the party line but do the right thing for the American people."
There was, however, one small problem. On the line was Cantor who, as the Obama campaign pointed out even before the call commenced, had voted in favor of that very same energy bill.
Of course, surrogates never have identical voting records as the candidates they support. And, as a consequence, politically awkward situations frequently bubble up to the electoral surface. On Sunday, for example, Sen. John Kerry was tasked with defending Obama's decision to allow off-shore drilling as a compromise component to a new energy bill, when the Massachusetts Democrat himself has spoken out vehemently against such a practice. On Monday, meanwhile, the McCain campaign and the RNC took Obama to task for touting the price-saving benefits of having one's tires fully inflated, even though such prominent McCain surrogates like Sen. Joseph Lieberman and Gov. Charlie Christ both support tire efficiency.

TERRE HAUTE, Ind. — An argument between newlyweds that began during their reception turned deadly only hours later when the groom fatally shot his new bride before killing himself, police say.
Vigo County Sheriff's Office deputies responding to frantic 911 calls Sunday found Kelly Samson, 50, shot several times in the torso and head with a .40-caliber semi-automatic pistol. They found Dr. George "Scott" Samson, 54, dead in the basement after he apparently shot himself once in the head with a .45-caliber handgun.
The pair were married Saturday evening.
"The investigation has revealed that there was a verbal argument between the couple toward the end of the reception, which carried over to the after party at the couple's home," Vigo County Chief Deputy Sheriff Clark Cottom said in an email.
"Shortly after the last guest left at around 1:17 a.m., Kelly Ecker Samson called 911 reporting that her husband had threatened to kill her. There were a total of three very brief 911 calls, which in the first two the caller disconnected."
While she was on the line, dispatchers heard what was thought to be multiple gunshots in the background.
Cottom says Kelly Samson's son and an elderly couple were inside the home at the time of the shootings.

Vigo County Coroner Dr. Susan Amos says George Samson worked as an anesthesiologist at Union Hospital.
He also is listed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives as a current federal firearms dealer.
Cottom did not specify what the newlyweds were arguing about during the reception or at home.

Apr 11, 2016; New Orleans, LA, USA; Chicago Bulls guard Mike Dunleavy (34) moves the ball down the court during the first quarter of the game against the New Orleans Pelicans at the Smoothie King Center. Mandatory Credit: Matt Bush-USA TODAY Sports
The Chicago Bulls had a surprisingly busy off-season, adding veterans Rajon Rondo and Dwyane Wade. Beyond the two biggest additions for the Bulls, there were a number of other moves throughout the roster, touching every position.
There have been so many moves conducted by Chicago that when we ran the moves made at point guard and shooting guard earlier this week, Isaiah Canaan didn't even come up. Of course, Canaan was signed by the Bulls in addition to the acquisitions of Spencer Dinwiddie, Jerian Grant, Jose Calderon for a short time, Rajon Rondo, and Dwyane Wade.
The backcourt was an extremely busy place during the Chicago Bulls off-season, but as we shift to the frontcourt things start to lighten up.
Small Forward Grade: D
D is for Dunleavy. As in, Mike Dunleavy – former Bull. Chicago traded the veteran combo player to help create room for the big splash on Dwyane Wade. Somehow, the move doesn't feel like a good one. Sure, moving Dunleavy seems like a great idea. Last season he was waylaid by injury and the most recent Mike highlight that pops to mind was when Giannis Antetokounmpo form tackled him during a playoff game in 2014.
Dunleavy was also part of a long line of veteran shooters who were good, but not at their peak while with Chicago. These players also seemed inept at creating their own scoring opportunities while in town, making them generally one-dimensional and not great at that dimension. Digging deeper than Dunleavy, you'll remember Kyle Korver. Korver went on to make a lot of 3-pointers for the Atlanta Hawks during their mini-run of success before falling victim to the “hustle” of Matthew Dellavedova. And there was Rip Hamilton before them, a guard primarily, but of the same mold. The ability to shoot was present in all three players, though it never really came together for any of them in Chicago.
While Hamilton had his heyday before coming to Chicago, Korver had his after leaving town. Now, it looks like Dunleavy is on to much greener pastures as he joins division foe Cleveland. Why the Bulls moved Dunleavy, I get. He was getting older, coming off of an injury and more limited in his ability to impact a game on a salary that would look better on someone else's books. He can still do something, though. Giving him to Cleveland just makes another division opponent that better than they were, which was already much better than whatever Chicago is.
The only addition that the Bulls have at small forward this season is going to be their second-round draft pick, Paul Zipser. The German international has been playing for Bayern Munich in his native country, but will be joining Chicago after the Olympics. At 22 years old, Zipser is one of the younger players to make the jump from Europe to the league. He will be intriguing to watch because he didn't exactly have much hype surrounding him heading into the draft and had the Bulls not drafted him, he might have been available when the draft was over and been brought in on a non-guaranteed deal.
Zipser is definitely nothing more than a backup in 2016-17, barring an unforeseen miracle. Really, there is some upside, but it appears to be something that will require development and time. Not really a needle mover.
While the Dunleavy deal needed to happen, even if Wade wasn't being brought in, he certainly didn't need to go to the Cavaliers, did he? With Dunleavy out, the Bulls brought in Paul Zipser. While he may end up having a successful NBA career, it looks like it will be a while before he really gets it going, though given Dunleavy's injury status last season, having an available forward might be better than having a forward who isn't healthy.
The German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) is a longitudinal study that's been tracking 12,000 households and 20,000 individuals since 1984. Each year, the members complete in-depth surveys tracking all sorts of data. Some of these gauge life satisfaction and keep the researchers up-to-date on major life changes. From this bounty of information, researchers have produced a number of intriguing findings, including the chart below:
What the graph shows is an increase in relative life satisfaction in the years before and leading up to marriage, but a marked decrease in the years following. Marriage, it would seem, is making people miserable.
But that, of course, is not necessarily true. If marriage really were so unpleasant, then far fewer people would be doing it. Instead, what the table more likely displays is the near futility of measuring life satisfaction with any sort of accuracy.
Let's look at the table a different way. Instead of interpreting a causal effect (which is incorrect), the graph may be more indicative of a decision-making heuristic at work. In other words, people are subconsciously taking a mental shortcut to assess overall life satisfaction, basing their opinion on easily retrievable information.
As explained by psychologist Daniel Kahneman, "...the score that you quickly assign to your life is determined by a small sample of highly available ideas, not by carefully weighting the domains of your life."
For example, in an amusing experiment conducted in 1983, a team led by noted psychologist Norbert Schwarz asked subjects to rate their overall life satisfaction on both sunny and rainy days. Those interviewed on a bright, sunny day reported being more satisfied with their lives in general compared with those interviewed on an overcast, rainy day.
In another, more sly experiment, Schwarz's team set up a situation whereby half of the subjects would -- by apparent luck -- discover a dime on a photocopy machine before being interviewed. Though the good fortune was meager by most standards, the respondents who stumbled upon it reported significantly higher life satisfaction than those who did not.
These studies corroborate Kahneman's analysis: that people are fickle with their assessments of life satisfaction, basing such evaluations upon their current mood state. With this in mind, let's return to the marriage graph.
"People who recently married, or are expecting to marry in the near future, are likely to retrieve that fact when asked a general question about their life," Kahneman states. Since marriage -- by and large -- is viewed as a great boon, they will probably deem their lives more satisfying.
So, concludes Kahneman, "Figure 16 can be read as a graph of the likelihood that people will think of their recent or forthcoming marriage when asked about their life."
Hurray! Marriage is vindicated of causing abject misery!

Revista Factum has obtained access to emails written by the businessman Jose Aquiles Enrique Rais Lopez. He is the owner of El Salvador's waste management company MIDES, and of a number of planes on which powerful public officials have flown, including El Salvador's prosecutor general and the former Honduran president Porfirio Lobo. The correspondence reveals that Rais tends to brag about his friendship with Jose Luis Merino, one of the most influential directors of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), and that money from his companies has been used to buy “politicians and planes,” and even a luxury apartment in Switzerland. The payments were made through transfers to bank accounts in El Salvador.
Factum confirmed the authenticity of these emails with former partners and employees of Enrique Rais, and with official Salvadoran and US investigators who have followed the case. The businessman used the email address erais52@hotmail.com for the majority of correspondence with his partners, employees, consultants and family members, as well as with government officials of the administration of former President Mauricio Funes. To these individuals, he offered to sell the landfill sites at Nejapa and Sonsonate. Revista Factum tried to contact the businessman before publishing the following article, but received no reply.
This story was originally published by Revista Factum and was translated, edited for clarity, and reprinted with permission. See the Spanish original here.
The year 2010 was a complicated one for Enrique Rais and his family. Bittersweet. On the one hand, disagreements were intensifying with his two partners in the waste collection business in El Salvador, the Canadians Matteo Pasquale and Franco Pacetti. But ahead of him were also the possibilities of new business deals and of expanding his political horizons. One of the most promising business opportunities, judging from an email sent on July 7 of this year, was the acquisition with companies from Kosovo of “product [to sell] to Alba Petroleos,” the hydrocarbon import company linked to directors of the ruling party FMLN.
That year, the business consortium directed by Enrique Rais included, in addition to MIDES, Hydroil — a business “duly authorised by the Finance Ministry to sell petroleum-derived products” — and the Rais Group International, a consortium registered in North Carolina, United States, with companies in Barbados.
By January 2011, Hydroil was offering diesel oil to Alba Petroleos, according to a letter signed November 11 by Rais as the legal representative of the business and addressed to the engineer Miguel Hernandez, general manager of Alba. Hydroil was offering 8.4 million gallons at $2.58 per gallon. The delivery time for the product: immediate. The condition set by the company: “Alba Petroleos will have to open an irrevocable credit card […] transferable against shipping documents in favor of Hydroil, S.A., of C.V.” In total, a deal worth $21.6 million.
Rais' business deals appeared to be going well, judging by certain purchases initiated by the businessman and his wife: at the end of 2010, the couple decided to buy a luxury apartment in the “Swiss Diamond Hotel” complex in Lugano, Switzerland. To pay for it, the Rais couple used, in part, funds from MIDES.
SEE ALSO: Coverage of Elites and Organized Crime
The bidding for the apartment had begun during the end of 2010, when Rais and his assistants exchanged at least three emails with executives of the Mabetex Group, a construction and real estate corporation based in Switzerland and founded in 1991 by Kosovo capitalists.
The initial sale offer was for $175,000 in four installments. Compared to similar offers found on web pages offering real estate in Lugano, this is a low price for an apartment of this type in a luxury hotel complex.
Curiously, in one of these emails, the Mabetex executives refer to each payment by naming places or people. The first two payments were made in Tuvalu and Kiribati (two island countries in Oceania), the third was under the name of the Kosovo citizen Mentor Nazarko and the fourth in the Dominican Republic.
A former associate of Rais, who spoke under condition of anonymity for personal security reasons, assured that he knew of the Swiss apartment and explained that the names of the locations were a way of concealing the destination of the transactions. However, it was Rais himself who broke this discretion.
In an email from November 30, 2010, entitled “Mission to Tuvalu,” Rais says: “Installment transfers have already been received for the Lugano apartment. Take note. Thank you. Enrique.”
The Kosovo Connection
At the end of 2011, Enrique Rais arrived with an official of the Republic of Kosovo, which had recently become independent, in a private hall in the Hotel Sheraton in San Salvador. There, they were met by officials of the Ministry of Foreign Relations. Rais and his companion were arriving to lobby for El Salvador to join the countries of the United Nations that had recognized Kosovo as a country.
The first reaction, according to an anonymous former Chancellor's Office employee who knew of the meeting, was prudent: San Salvador would only study the petitions.
One of the owners of Mabetex is Behgjet Pacolli, an engineer who was president of Kosovo for little more than two months, between February and April 2011, and later vice prime minister, from April 2011 to December of last year. The relationship between Pacolli and Rais, judging from emails between the two and business offers from the Kosovar to the Salvadoran, was close.
On February 23, 2011, Rais sent an email to one of his associates: “My friend and associate Bedjet (sic) Pacolli was sworn in yesterday as president of Kosovo. It's what I've been waiting for and we already started our landfill company in Tripoli and Libya (sic).”
By 2013, the lobbying carried out by Rais and his Kosovo friends in San Salvador, in which the former ambassador of the United States in El Salvador William Walker had also partly participated, was showing results. In October of this year, the Salvadoran Chancellor's Office delivered a diplomatic message to the Kosovo consulate in New York to inform them that the Central American country formally recognized the independence of Kosovo.
“El Chino” Martinez and the War with the Canadians
On October 25, 2012, a month and a week before El Salvador's Assembly elected him prosecutor general, Luis Martinez turned to a friend in order to strengthen key political support for his election. This friend is Hugo Blanco Rais, nephew of Enrique.
Martinez, according to correspondence between Rais family members, offered, should he take office as prosecutor general, to make certain moves demanded by Enrique.
“… He reiterated that he would appoint Mario (Calderon) if you help him with Merino, appoint Lisset in the department that you said and that he'll remove the people we talked about. Regards, Hugo.”
Luis Martinez had his reasons to attend to Enirique Rais: he knew that the businessman and Jose Luis Merino, the leader of the FMLN, had a good relationship.
In the first few months of 2010, according to email correspondence from erais52@hotmail.com, Enrique Rais was communicating with high officials of the Funes administration to explore the possibility of selling the landfills of Nejapa and Sonsonate to the government. On March 30 the businessman wrote a message to the email address carlos.caceres@mh.gob.sv, of the current Finance Minister Carlos Caceres, to request a meeting to discuss the topic.
Caceres replied almost a month later, on April 21, copying in Franzi Hato Hasbun, the secretary of strategic affairs for the presidency. Caceres suggests an independent audit of both properties to guarantee transparency in a possible deal.
SEE ALSO: El Salvador News and Profiles
That same day, Rais told his associates in the waste disposal business, the Canadians Pasquale and Pacetti, that he had received a “green light” by Funes to negotiate with Hasbun. Months later, however, Rais told his associates, to whom he had said that he would request $60 million for the landfill sites, that he had only received an offer for half that amount.
The last three emails are exchanges between Rais and his Canadian associates. At this time, the foreigners were beginning to complain to the Salvadoran that he was not making the payments that had been agreed upon when they set up the arrangement a decade ago.
According to the Canadians' version of events, recorded in legal documents, Enrique Rais refused to pay the agreed dividends, so Pacetti began demanding the restitution of the money owed.
During 2012, Rais made various payments of dividends that he believed sufficient to cover the entire debt. Pacetti and Pasquale claim that the quantities received were not sufficient to cover the debt, so they carried out a legal transfer in Barbados, where the company was established, to take possession of shares of MIDES that belonged to Rais.
The Lawyers That Ended Up Threatened, In Prison or In Court
In June 2013, Rais sued Pasquale and Pacetti in three different Salvadoran courts for extortion, wrongful withholding (for the shares in Barbados), and for defamation. The final result favoured the Salvadoran: two judges ordered arrest warrants with an Interpol red alert for both Canadians.
The foreigners took action themselves on December 30, 2013: they countersued Rais for fraud. The duration of this process was much shorter: it did not leave the peace court, at first because the Prosecutor General's Office, under the orders of Luis Martinez, asked for a definitive exoneration, and later because the peace judge acquitted Rais of all charges.
The prestigious Salvadoran law firm Romero-Pineda was one of those chosen by the Canadians to represent them. On June 2, 2014, however, the lawyers sent a letter to Pasquale and Pacetti announcing that they would not represent them. The main reason: fear.
Mario Calderon was, in 2012, one of Enrique Rais' main advisers. However, Calderon stepped down. Calderon ended up working with Matteo Pasquale and Franco Pacetti, Rais' rivals. After the change in clients, the lawyer faced three legal proceedings initiated by the Prosecutor General's Office. Today, Calderon is imprisoned in Metapan for one of these cases. His wife, Claudia Herrera, is also in prison.
In November 2014 Revista Factum published a report revealing that Luis Martinez used Rais' airplanes for various trips — official and private — and that at least one of these flights was regarding procedures related to the dispute between the businessman and the Canadians, who the prosecutor general had already accused of extortion.
Today, according to a loan request made to the Espirito Santo de Brazil Bank three years ago, Enrique Rais' group owns 17 businesses.

A woman in Kerala, who was allegedly harassed by her in-laws, threw her three-week-old son into a washing machine in a bid to convince her husband that the child was not safe and to move to her mother's house.
First, she blamed it on an an intruder
Police said Fazna of Kozhikode raised an alarm on Thursday night and told neighbours who rushed to her aid that an unidentified burglar threw chilli powder in her face and fled after throwing her baby into the washing machine.

Though Fasna Hayaruddin, mother of the infant, initially claimed that she and the child were attacked by an unidentified assailant, police grew suspicious after the woman gave contradictory statements to the queries. But police ruled out the chances for the entry of an outsider to the house after inspecting the house as the chilli powder was taken from the kitchen of the same house and no other sign of trespass was visible.
Then, she blamed it on the husband

Later the woman changed her statement and alleged that her husband committed the crime. She also named a few of her in-laws responsible for the crime during the interrogation. Police, however, found no proof of an intruder and interrogated Fazna who confessed that she staged the drama to convince her husband Fayaruddin to shift. While the baby has been admitted to a hospital, the police have registered a case but have yet to arrest Fazna.
Post natal depression
According to police officials, the woman was in a state of depression throughout her pregnancy period as she conceived the second child when the first one was only six months. The infant, who was injured following the incident, is undergoing treatment at ICU at Institute of Maternity and Child Health Kozhikode. The child is recovering and the police expect to interrogate the woman further on Saturday.

For Tevin Coleman, it really isn't fair.
Coleman has had an incredible season as Indiana's top running back. He has rivaled the marks that Anthony Thompson set during his career at IU in the late 1980s, and has been the offense's biggest spark during a tough season in which the Hoosiers are 3-7 and have still not won a single Big Ten game. Despite this, Coleman has not slowed down, even as defenses have become more adept at containing him. And on Saturday, he had his magnum opus of the season, running for 308 yards and a touchdown against Rutgers during an otherwise forgettable late-season Big Ten matchup.
This week, I'm doing the game recap differently. This recap is dedicated to Tevin Coleman, who may only have two more games left in an Indiana uniform before he turns pro. This was his day, and I want to honor him and what he's done for the Hoosiers this season, because he does not get as much publicity as other top college football players in the country.
Even though Coleman had a tremendous game, and averaged 9.6 yards on each of his 32 carries, it ultimately wasn't enough. Rutgers was the more dominant team all day, and the Scarlet Knights rolled over the Hoosiers, 45-23. Alas, even Coleman himself was overshadowed by another running back in the conference. While this game was happening, Wisconsin's Melvin Gordon ran for 408 rushing yards against Nebraska, breaking the NCAA single-game record. That's right. In what may be the most Indiana football thing of all Indiana football things, Coleman likely won't even get honored by the B1G as Offensive Player of the Week because of Gordon's huge game. In addition, despite his gaudy numbers on the year (1,678 yards, 12 TDs, 7.8 yards per carry), there is no chance Coleman will even get consideration for a Heisman, since he plays on the 3-7 Hoosiers as opposed to a team like the 8-2 Badgers.
Let's recap how he did this game. Coleman started out slowly, and had trouble getting his footing during the first quarter. With Rutgers up 10-3 in the second quarter, Coleman began to get some momentum, running for 35 yards on two plays to set up a Griffin Oakes field goal. Then with less than a minute left in the half, Coleman broke free, running for 67 yards and a touchdown to give the Hoosiers the halftime lead.
On the first drive of the second half, Coleman didn't slow down, running for 68 yards down to the Rutgers 5. But as we said, Coleman's career has been unfair, so of course, the Hoosiers could only settle for a field goal from there. A couple drives later Coleman started out strong again, getting the ball to midfield, but a Diamont interception, one of his few bad throws of the game, ended this opportunity. On the final IU drive of the game, with the outcome long out of hand, Coleman ran the ball one last time for 13 yards, which clinched over 300 yards for Coleman on the day.
As for the rest of the team, there were a mix of positives and negatives, but ultimately while we saw some great individual performances, the team itself didn't hang together enough to get a victory. Zander Diamont had a decent day passing, and despite some rookie mistakes while under pressure, he looked a lot more confident throwing the ball. Unfortunately, his receivers kept dropping the ball seemingly after every pass, which was frustrating to say the least.
The other side of the ball was also frustratingly inconsistent. While the defense was pressuring Gary Nova and forced a few fumbles, it is also games up 45 points and often let the Scarlet Knights drive the ball down the field without any resistance. Even the special teams, which started the game out with an exciting successful onside kick, had its share of miscues, including an embarrassing fake punt, a muffed return that led to a touchdown, and a terrible roughing the punter call by the refs that basically iced the game for the Scarlet Knights.
But today was all about Tevin Coleman. His college career hasn't been fair, but it has been memorable for Hoosier fans. While it unfortunately never did happen here, hopefully he will latch on to a winning team in the future. We'll definitely be rooting for him.
FOOTVILLE, Wis. — Wisconsin dairy farmer Steve Case knew his pregnant cow had been acting strangely, but nothing prepared Case for the sight that greeted him when he responded to an urgent bellowing from his barn.
The Holstein had given birth to a rare set of triplet calves Friday afternoon.
“I just about fell over,” Case said.
The Footville farmer quickly dried off the calves. Their mother, an unnamed cow identified by ear tag No. 1,150, “did her job getting the first milk into them.”
Veterinarian Ray Pawlisch told The Janesville Gazette that few triplet calves are born alive and healthy because there usually are complications. He cited a 2006 study by a University of Wisconsin-Madison researcher who found triplets occur in less than one-third of 1 percent of Holstein pregnancies.
Case said he's had many sets of twins but never triplets in his 33 years of farming. The calves look similar but are not identical, he said.
“I'm glad they're all alive,” he said. “It was a total surprise to me.”
Case's brother had a set of triplet cows born on his farm in 1981. Case said he's now having ultrasounds done on his other pregnant cows.
“It's just something we would want to know,” he said.
Do you feel you've been asked to vote a few many times recently? Two general elections and a referendum in the last couple of years have tried the patience of many. But over the last few days at the General Synod of the Church of England I have voted more times than I have the patience to count. There was a period on Saturday evening when I think we voted five times in a half an hour period on just one controversial motion and a variety of complex amendments.
The headlines will have made it all sound very simple: “Synod bans gay conversion therapy” and “Anglicans welcome transgender people.” And so when the voting records are published it will be very easy for many to vilify Synod members like myself who voted against the motions behind both those positive-sounding headlines. How can any Christian vote to continue electronic shock treatment of vulnerable LGBT people or turn young trans teenagers away from our doors?!
Why I voted against
Except that I only voted against the motion to ban conversion therapy because there was no clear definition of what exactly we were banning. Plenty of appalling past practices were movingly shared and if the motion had been specific enough to give me a chance to clearly condemn such damaging behaviour I would have gladly taken it. Instead ambiguity was allowed to develop about what we were trying to get rid of – would responsible prayer ministry and every day pastoral care of LGBT people be affected by the ban? We were told not, but given no guarantees, and without such clarity I couldn't support a motion that could undermine the church's future loving care of people like me.
If the motion had been specific enough to give me a chance to clearly condemn such damaging behaviour I would have gladly taken it.
Sitting in the debate (and constantly seeking to speak in it) was obviously especially hard for someone who experiences same-sex attraction myself and so can more easily imagine the acute pain the errors of the past and present have caused many of my sisters and brothers in Christ. I have personally chosen the path of celibacy as the Biblically orthodox response but also acknowledge that the attitudes and treatments most commonly associated with gay conversion therapy are just wrong. The last thing I wanted to do is to be seen to want to preserve them. But I did want to protect the freedom of people like me to access prayer and pastoral care from Christian leaders without them living in fear as to what they can or cannot say or do.
My colleague Sean Doherty tabled an amendment to the main motion that would have ensured this – sadly it was defeated by a Synod that often seems to have more of an eye for the short-lived headline or tweet than the more nuanced approach that will better help us all in the long-term.
This behaviour was sadly repeated on the Sunday when we voted on a motion to both welcome transgender people to our churches and ask our bishops to consider providing new liturgy for them. What's the problem with that you might ask? Surely Christian churches should be welcoming all? Yes! I'd have voted for a motion that just said that. But the Church of England (for better, for worse) does so much of its theology through its liturgy and it was again left unclear as to what we were asking our bishops to do.
It was again left unclear as to what we were asking our bishops to do.
How could we request them to come up with new services when we (like many in society around us) have yet to get our minds around the incredibly complex experience of the growing number of people experiencing gender dysphoria? Again a more nuanced amendment failed to gather enough support and - threatened with potentially being responsible for the suicide of a young York student - Synod voted for a simplistic alternative.
Why not stand down?
So why do I keep voting? After a weekend of not just being on the losing side but on what will be perceived by many as the morally wrong side why do I keep turning up? Well because I don't believe that you can rightly criticise a process and people that you haven't made every effort to engage with. So I'll be back for more voting. Spare a prayer for a bit more patience.

Felix Comeau could soon be rubbing his hands with glee. His company stands to make millions of dollars selling a device that could make it easy for police to determine whether drivers are high on drugs.
But the suit-wearing CEO wants to be sure everyone knows he's interested in more than just money.
Alcohol Countermeasure Systems CEO Felix Comeau demonstrates the DrugWipe testing device. (CBC) "It's useful not only for us in the commercial sense," he says, standing in one of his company's labs in a suburb of Toronto.
"It's useful for the police. They have been looking for, waiting for, a tool that can be used at the roadside effectively, efficiently and accurately to determine whether a person has drugs in their body."
Canada's Department of Justice has commissioned a scientific evaluation of drug-screening devices from three manufacturers, including Comeau's "DrugWipe" product.
All three have just been given the green light to move forward to the next stage of the approval process.
'Stick out your tongue'
Comeau is happy to demonstrate for a CBC News camera crew how the "DrugWipe" works, ripping open a foil wrapper to pull out the plastic cartridge. Different versions of the device test for the presence of various drugs, including cannabis, cocaine, methamphetamines and opiates.
The cartridge analyzes a saliva sample within 10 minutes. (CBC) "The policeman just asks the driver to open his mouth, stick out his tongue," he says, pointing out small pads on one end of the cartridge, "and the pad is wiped over the tongue."
A few minutes later, lines show up in a tiny display window on the device, indicating which drugs have been found in a driver's saliva. And what happens if drugs are present?
"Then the policeman gets to arrest you," says Comeau with a smile.
The DrugWipe products test for the presence of a number of different drugs. (CBC)
Comeau's company, Alcohol Countermeasures Systems Inc., built its business selling breathalyzers to test for booze. But now he and many other business people see a massive opportunity in drug-related testing tools.
Ex-Mountie goes from drug busts to drug business
Cannabix founder Kal Mahli blows into his marijuana breathalyzer. (CBC) "I think in every generation we come across a monumental shift in society that offers a business opportunity," says Kal Mahli, a former RCMP officer from Vancouver. After years with the force's marijuana enforcement team, Mahli is developing a marijuana breathalyzer. So far he's raised $2 million in investment for his fledgling firm, Cannabix.
"The marijuana industry is a business opportunity that's growing into a trillion-dollar industry. But we also believe that developing a tool like ours, to ensure safety on the roads, also offers a multibillion-dollar opportunity."
Both the RCMP and the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police have been vocal about their desire for improved technology to crack down on the deadly problem of stoned drivers.
"We do have programs out there such as drug recognition training for officers, but police need more tools and techniques," says RCMP Insp. James Taplin, who is in charge of National Traffic Services. "It's been difficult to go for a criminal charge. And that's the beauty of these devices. If we get the legislation to support roadside oral fluid screening, we're hoping that there would be a legal limit for drugs."
Finding the legal limit
In a darkened room at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, research is already underway to determine where a legal limit for marijuana should be set. A small office houses a massive driving simulator; computers and large screens surround the driver to simulate driving perspectives.
Study participants smoke a real marijuana cigarette or a placebo version before taking a drive in the simulator. Their reactions are then tracked and analyzed.
Survey participants operate a driving simulator while under the influence of cannabis. (CBC)
"We are looking at the effects of cannabis on driving simulator performance to see how it affects psychomotor performance and the various aspects of the driving task," says Robert Mann, the senior scientist who is leading the CAMH study. "And we'll be relating that to levels of THC in blood."
Police in the United Kingdom, Australia and the U.S. are already using drug testing devices during roadside stops. Most use the devices that the federal Department of Justice asked to be evaluated here. The next phase of the approval process will involve confirming that the devices work in Canada's most extreme weather conditions.
New era for DUI charges
"We do it for alcohol, why wouldn't we do a similar thing for drugs?" asks Doug Beirness, vice-chair of the Canadian Society of Forensic Science, the group that conducted the research for the Justice Department. "The problem is of equal magnitude. What we need is something to help police officers to get these people off the road."
According to the latest data from the Traffic Injury Research Foundation of Canada, 35.6 per cent of fatal crashes in 2012 involved drivers who had been drinking alcohol, while 40 per cent tested positive for drugs. Beirness notes there is overlap between those two groups; some drivers had both drugs and alcohol in their system.
In the group of drug users, cannabis was present in almost half the cases, 45.5 per cent.
While it may seem that the Liberals' promise to legalize marijuana prompted the review of roadside drug tests, the Justice Department confirms the evaluation began in 2014, well before the change in government. The department declined an interview with CBC, but most of those connected with the evaluation process say it was spurred when officials became aware of the testing devices and their use in other countries.
Legislation to legalize marijuana is not expected to be finalized quickly, but enforcement officials point out that existing impaired driving legislation covers both alcohol and drugs.
Comeau, Mahli and countless players in the business of diagnostic devices are eagerly awaiting expanded legislation that will give police the ability to demand saliva samples at the roadside. Drug users, take note.

A resolution against Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his “allegations of terrorism against Pakistan” was on Thursday blocked in the Assembly of Punjab province.

The opposition comprising Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf, PPP, PML-Q and Jamaat-e-Islami wanted to bring the “anti-Modi” resolution in the 372-member house but Speaker Rana Iqbal did not allow it.
Opposition members started shouting slogans against India and the ruling PML-N government as they tore the copies of the agenda of Thursday's proceedings.
Opposition Leader Mahmoodur Rasheed said it was unfortunate that the Speaker was indirectly supporting Modi.
The opposition members then walked out and held a demonstration on the stairs of the Assembly. Earlier in the day, they had submitted the resolution.
Reading out from the resolution to reporters, Rasheed said: “The resolution is against the attitude of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mr Modi had repeated baseless allegations of terrorism against Pakistan. We strongly condemn (Mr Modi) for repeating the allegations.
“We demand that the new Indian government stop funding terrorists in Balochistan, end its illegal hold on the water of Kashmir and Pakistan. The people of Pakistan want peace between the two countries.”
The resolution further reads: “India should stop acting like a station house officer (SHO) of the region. It should not consider Pakistan's resolve for peace a weakness and start peace dialogue with it.
“The main hurdle in peace between Pakistan and India is the Kashmir dispute which should be resolved under the UN Resolution 1948 which carries the signature of former Indian premier Jawaharlal Nehru.”

Rasheed said the PML-N government had demonstrated that it was pro-India. He said the opposition would continue its protest and would not let the speaker run the house smoothly.

By SALMA SHUKRALLAH, Associated Press
CAIRO (AP) — Prosecutors on Monday referred the head of Egypt's journalists union and two board members to trial after they were formally charged with spreading false news and harboring journalists wanted by authorities.
A statement by the Cairo prosecution office said their trial would begin on Saturday.
The three were questioned for hours by prosecutors Sunday night. On Monday, they refused to post bail of 10,000 pounds ($1,000) each and were detained at a police station in central Cairo, Khaled el-Balshy, one of the board members facing prosecution, and defense lawyer Sayed Abu Zeid told The Associated Press.
"We refused to pay because the accusations are related to publishing news and that should not involve imprisonment or bail," said el-Balshy.
The prosecution office said the three were released late Monday without posting bail. The three journalists could face prison if convicted.
Amnesty International condemned the legal proceedings against the three, describing the accusations they face as a "dangerous escalation" and part of the government's "draconian" crackdown on freedom of expression.
The move against the three came less than a month after the head of the union, Yahya Qalash, called for the interior minister's resignation and a presidential apology over an alleged police raid to snatch two journalists wanted for inciting protests who had taken refuge inside the union's building in downtown Cairo.
Authorities deny the allegation that police forcibly entered the building, saying they had an arrest warrant and coordinated in advance with union board members. Qalash, the union's head, later sought to ease the tense standoff with the government, dropping his demand for a presidential apology and not repeating his demand for the minister to step down.
President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi's government has significantly curbed many of the freedoms Egyptians won following the country's 2011 popular uprising, defending a 2013 law that effectively bans street protests and repeatedly stating that Egypt's human rights record must not be judged by Western standards.
Pro-government media routinely defames critics and brands any opposition as either treason or motived by clandestine support for the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group from which Mohammed Morsi, the president el-Sissi ousted in 2013, hails.
On Monday, el-Sissi again showed a desire to extend government influence to the media and entertainment industry.
He spoke at an inauguration ceremony for a new housing project in Cairo for low-income Egyptians. The project is a substitute model for the shanty towns that ring the Egyptian capital and are often depicted in movies as violent, crime infested and morally degenerate areas.
"The claim through movies that their residents are different is inappropriate, paints a negative picture and divides society," he said. "Those people are well bred and have morals and values ... We should not allow them (the movies) and they should not be produced."
It was not clear how the president's directive would be implemented since film-making is in the hands of private production companies. Egypt has a state censor who must approve the script of any new movie before it is shot, although cases where the censor rejected a script are rare.
Health care in the United States is stuck in a rut. Americans are spending more on the same old care. The disastrous Obamacare rollout creates more problems than the administration can spin that it “solves.” We have simply grown to accept rising prices and stagnating service as a fact of life.
It doesn't have to be this way.
Imagine a world where everyone, not just the mega-rich, has access to modern, affordable, high-quality care. In this world, doctors don't need to beg bureaucrats and insurance administrators for permission to save lives. Entrepreneurs here actively compete to lower prices and innovate novel solutions. Imagine, in other words, a world in which our health care system is dragged out of the Stone Age and into a modern, competitive market economy.
Two of my colleagues at the Mercatus Center are actively fighting to make this world our reality. Their unique visions of addressing supply-side stagnation in the health care sector and promoting permissionless innovation across industries combines to provide a powerful solution for our health care woes.
Robert Graboyes, our resident health care expert, believes that the health care debate produced the wrong diagnosis. While most health commentators focus on the demand side and service provision, Graboyes says the real sickness lies in the outcomes of those services. He asks, “Why is there no Steve Jobs of health care?”
That's a good question. Where are the visionaries of vaccination innovations, the capitalists of cost-cutting care provision, the impresarios of imaging technology?
Grayboyes notes that recent advances in “[g]enomics, 3-D printing, nanobots, wearable sensors,social media, telecommunications, imaging, artificial intelligence, state-of-the-art data mining and other new technologies” have not been substantially integrated into health care provision despite their obvious benefits. These kinds of cutting-edge applications are not only possible, they are necessary to break (not just cut!) the health cost curve.
Over the years, Graboyes has collected many exciting examples of innovations that have been quietly occurring under the radar across the health care world. The solutions that will fundamentally improve health care provision come not from legacy corporate mega-labs, but from those great incubators of American innovation: people's garages.
Consider the story of Paul McCarthy, the father of a 12-year-old boy in need of finger prosthetics. McCarthy did not accept the $30,000 prosthetic solution that was presented by the legacy U.S. health system. He took to the Internet to find better and less expensive care for his son. His search led him to assemble an unlikely team of a South African woodworker, an American puppeteer, and a South African father in a similar situation. The three men collaborated over thousands of miles to produce “inexpensive but workable prosthetics using 3-D printers.” Where there's a will (and decent wi-fi), entrepreneurial humans will always find a way.
This kind of innovation is remarkable, but unfortunately fragile. The entire enterprise could crumble overnight at the stroke of a regulator's pen, or a change in an insurance company's policy, or a lawsuit filed by a jealous entrenched interest. These benefits would be, and too often are, simply buried under our health care system's own dysfunction. Graboyes coins an apt metaphor to explain the problem: the frontier of innovation is being quashed by the fortress of entrenched interests.
The frontier's innovation in healthcare is the solution, but the fortress will not give up its control without a fight.
Here's where my second colleague, Adam Thierer comes in. His excellent new book,Permissionless Innovation, makes a passionate case for knocking down these barriers to innovation erected by governments and special interest groups. Thierer argues that the creators of new technology shouldn't have to seek the blessings of skeptical, out-of-touch regulators before being allowed to develop and deploy innovations.
Compare this permissionless innovation to the stifling “precautionary principle” norm favored by public officials. This principle allows regulators' imaginations to run away with them: Any perceived threat of a low-probability, worst-case scenario is a good enough excuse for these officials to stifle technological developments. The Frontier is strangled so the Fortress can keep its power for another day.
Consider how the precautionary principle affected the innovative genomics testing company 23andme. Last November, the Food and Drug Administration ordered the company to stop marketing its product. Why? Because 23andme had not sufficiently kissed the regulatory emperors' ring. Like a jealous frenemy, the FDA was miffed that the company had not sought and obtained permission from the agency since May of that year. Meanwhile, Americans in need of genetic information simply must suffer.
This is just one battle in the war for the soul of technology. By extension, the future of health care rests in which of these two visions prevails: the permissionless innovation of the frontier or the precautionary principle of the fortress?
As Thierer concludes, “the case of permissionless innovation is synonymous with the case for humane freedom more generally.” Better yet, the case for human freedom is ultimately the case for progress. If we can apply that freedom to our ailing health system, my two colleagues and friends promise it will rock our world.
South Korea will require people who trade Bitcoin and other virtual currencies to do so under their real names, the country's government said on Thursday, as part of efforts to curb speculation.
Bitcoin, the best-known virtual currency, has been on a gravity-defying bull run over the past few months. The price of a Bitcoin started the year at around $1,000 and topped $19,000 earlier this month, causing swarms of ordinary savers around the world to get in on what remains a largely unregulated — and highly volatile — investment.
Nowhere, though, has the frenzy over virtual currencies been as fevered, or as sudden, as in South Korea.
Until recently, markets for Bitcoin and its competitors barely existed in the country. But a spurt of interest has swept up ordinary people from students to retirees. Trading has become so popular that some South Korean exchanges have set up physical storefronts where the uninitiated can learn more and buy in.

BIRMINGHAM Ala. (Reuters) - Authorities on Wednesday released the names of the victims killed a day earlier in a murder-suicide at a UPS facility in Alabama, where police said an employee who had been fired shot dead two supervisors before turning the gun on himself.
The victims in the Tuesday shooting in Birmingham were Doug Hutcheson, 33, and Brian Callans, 46, the Jefferson County Medical Examiner's Office said.
The men were at work on Tuesday morning when Kerry Joe Tesney, 45, a 21-year employee of the shipping company who had been fired and recently learned he had lost an appeal to be reinstated, drove to the bay area of the large brick facility, police said.
Wearing a brown UPS work uniform, Tesney got out of his Honda SUV, entered the office area where Hutcheson and Callans were working, and shot them, police said.
He then killed himself, using a handgun recovered at the scene, police said.
Hutcheson, a driver supervisor who lived in Odenville, about 25 miles northeast of Birmingham, had been with UPS 15 years, the company said.
Callans, a UPS business manager who lived in Birmingham, had worked at the company for 26 years, the company said.
Tesney, who police said had been terminated within the past month but had appealed in the hopes of getting his job back, was a resident of Trussville, a suburb east of Birmingham.
Police are continuing to investigative the incident, said Birmingham Police Lieutenant Sean Edwards.
Best Buy today released the results of a probe into former CEO Brian Dunn's relationship with a 29-year-old female subordinate, and they are not too flattering.
The audit committee's report says that Dunn, 51, "violated Company policy by engaging in an extremely close personal relationship with a female employee that negatively impacted the work environment."
How close is "extremely close"? The former CEO and the younger employee went to lunch and drinks on multiple occasions during both the work week and on weekends. Dunn gave the female employee tickets to at least seven concerts and sporting events. And employees often saw them alone in Dunn's office or company conference rooms.
However, the audit committee concluded that Dunn did not use company resources or the corporate jet to pursue what both he and the female employee swear was a no-benefits friendship. Still, the behavior of Dunn and his younger female buddy were evidently disturbing and distracting to other Best Buy employees. And the CEO-subordinate duo seemed to be in touch an awful lot.
"During one four-day and one five-day trip abroad during 2011, the CEO contacted the female employee by cell phone at least 224 times, including 33 phone calls, 149 text messages, and 42 picture or video messages. In one instance, several photographs were discovered on the CEO's personal cell phone that contained messages expressing affection, one of which included the female employee's initials," the report states.
The audit committee spoke with 34 employees and former employees, dug through e-mails, and reviewed ethic complaints as part of its probe. Turns out that these relationships was not too secret: the female employee spoke openly--and "frequently," the report states--about her friendship with the CEO and the favors he lavished upon her. Her supervisor said this made the favored employee difficult to manage.
Dunn's list of inappropriate behavior in relationship to this employee goes on and on. He solicited a vendor at a concert in Las Vegas for a complimentary ticket for the woman. He loaned the female employee $600 of his own money so that she could change her plane ticket from Las Vegas, and he allowed her to use an empty hotel room "not paid for by the Company or by her," the report states.
Dunn stepped down as CEO in early April, and the company has been promising to bring to light the reasons ever since. Billionaire Best Buy founder Richard Schulze, worth $2 billion as of our latest Forbes count, finally made a statement on the matter as part of the report:
“In December, when the conduct of our then-CEO was brought to my attention, I confronted him with the allegations (which he denied), told him his conduct was totally unacceptable and contrary to Best Buy's policies and everything I, and the Company, stand for. I understand and accept the findings of the Audit Committee,” Schulze said in his statement.
As part of its findings, the audit committee slapped Schulze on the wrist, finding that he, too, "acted inappropriately" by failing to immediately notify the rest of the board when he learned about Dunn's behavior in December. Schulze will continue to serve out his term as chairman of the board until June 2013, and then the head of the audit committee, Hatim Tyabji, will become Best Buy's new chairman of the board.
Who knows what will become of Brian Dunn after this performance, but he shouldn't have to worry about his finances any time soon. As the investigation wrapped up, Dunn and the audit committee agreed on his separation package, which totals $6.6 million.
Here's what he gets after ending up in this big mess:
• Previously earned FY2012 bonus: $1,140,000
• Previously awarded and reported restricted stock grants of 131,876 shares, valued at close of business on Friday, May 11, 2012, ($19.28 per share), totaling $2,542,569
• Severance payment of $2,850,000
• Compensation for unused vacation: $106,742
Using the May 11, 2012, stock price for calculation, the estimated total value of the severance package is $6,639,311.
Here is a copy of the audit committee's report on Dunn:
AudioEngine A2+ Review
These speakers are small.
Component Overview:
Tweeter
Here you can see the details of the tweeter, as well as the painted finish for the cabinet which looks pretty good. Note that the photo was taken off axis, and that the tweeter is properly centered.
Woofer
The woofer is a tiny 2.75 inch kevlar unit that looks more like carbon fiber. It does not have much in the way of surround, and I'm not sure how it's going to perform as physics is definitely working against it.
Port
The slot port is about the size of a credit card. It's on the front of the speaker allowing placement close to back walls.
Plate Amp
This is what happens when I try to take pictures with my phone. Ignoring the shit quality of the photo, we can kind of make out that the amp has a couple of input options. We are looking at a 1/8 inch jack for portable sources, and a pair of RCA's for your more standard sources such as a cd player or turntable if you are a hipster. The star of the show is a USB input, which will take digital directly from your computer and handle all of the conversions inside of the speaker before amplifying the sound.
Cabinet
Cracking this little speaker open we can see the mess of poly fill.
Amp
Looks to be a pretty good sized heatsink on the 15 watts per channel amp. The plate that the amp is attached is actually pretty thick aluminum and while using the speaker the backplate will get a little warm as the plate acts as a heat sink as well.
I don't know much about the design of this board, but I can spot a Texas Instruments PCM2704 chip on there which appears to be the DAC chip.
Crossover
Getting the poly fill out of the way we can see that there is in fact a passive crossover attached to a tiny little brace..The crossover has 2 coils, 2 caps, and one resistor. I'm guessing that it's a second order crossover for both the tweeter and woofer with some level matching via the resistor.
Stands
To give these guys the best shot of performing I ponied up the extra $30 for a pair of branded AudioEngine desktop stands. These are made out of something like neoprene and angle the little speakers up toward the listener.
Here you can see the thin walled construction. I could crush it in my hand, but it would probably bounce back into roughly the same shape. Someone over there at AudioEngine is sitting on a pile of money made off of these things.
Grills
No grills. Even AudioEngine knows that grills are for pussies.
Listening Notes:
Setup was as easy as plugging in the usb connector and power. I propped the AudioEngine A2+ up onto of my Micca club subs to bring them up to ear level for initial impressions, but quickly found them lacking. After moving a truckload of stuff off of my desk I went with the stands they were designed to use and things improved.
The A2+ has bass response that is impressive for any desktop speaker, and to hear sound this full come from a speaker this size is surprising.
I can tell that these speakers were designed for the desktop. Unlike the small bookshelf speakers that I usually test these would not work anywhere else.
These sound like computer speakers. Pretty well balanced computer speakers, but definitely not audiophile quality.
Female vocals are recessed, and male vocals are smothered by a midbass hump
The treble is not bad, but it is a little over detailed and ever so slightly harsh.
Guitar, like female vocals is hidden behind the "v" shaped frequency response.
Clarity is excellent, no audible distortion at relaxed listening levels.
Angel by Massive attack sounds punchy and kind of deep. Raising the volume levels and the bass starts honking.
I can hear distortion either from the port, or the woofer voice coil bottoming out. Port turbulence is like sitting in a car with the A/C on blowing in your face.
Above a polite whisper these sounds like noise, the music is gone.
Measurements:
The dip from 4-6k is where the guitar and female vocals went. The hump in the mid bass is evident even with my shitty room showing it's ass in the measurement.
DSP Correction:
Flattened out the treble and the midrange, and worked a lot on the bass response. To avoid the speaker bottoming out I put a 20dB cut below 40Hz, which actually freed up a little room to enhance the bass response with a little bump around 70Hz. The biggest change is flattening out the mid bass, which got a 6dB cut, and sounds worlds better.
Yep, this is a pretty good response now.
Corrected Listening Notes:
Twice as much air as before, not from the tweeters, from the ports. I've got shit fly off of the desk from the port turbulence.
Woofer is finally not bottoming out unless I really push the whole speaker to the edge of distortion.
The treble sounds worlds better.
Listening off axis vertically, slightly above the speakers is rolling off the highs.
Nothing Happens in June by Ulrich Schnauss sound good.
Guitar and Sax are smoking, drums and bass are put into their place.
Imaging is way off with the speakers on the desktop stands, but this is a compromise for the added bass extension.
They get louder, sound clearer, and play deeper.
Plenty loud for a desktop, but listening further away in any room above flea size they will not be very impressive.
DSP Corrected headroom test netted pretty good results. This shows the bass response from the real time analyzer with the mic at the listening position along with my SPL meter in hand while playing a bass heavy section of Faces by Polymath.
Final Thoughts:
This is a computer speaker that sounds pretty good, but it's not great. I'm a picky bastard, so I would classify the stock sound as hideous. With the over enthusiastic "look at me" midbass being a dealbreaker. Outside of the bass response the treble is pretty clean, but hides information with a dip in the response. I've heard plenty worse, but only a few for this much money.
The verdict after the DSP correction is pretty good. They don't play really loud, they don't image very well, but they are at least tonally neutral and play into the 48Hz range when positioned in a corner.
These speakers cost a good bit for what they are, and should only be considered if you have absolutely no room for anything even slightly larger on your desk.

Hack Your Education: Essential Technology for the Modern Graduate Student
Today, a successful graduate student needs more than just pens and paper to succeed. Here's a look at how technology can help any learner gain an edge.
Smart Notebook
Go beyond paper with Moleskine's Evernote smart notebook, which allows you to take notes with pen and paper and convert them to digital files via an app on your smartphone. The app allows you to organize and access notes, even sharing them with your study friends.
Phone Charging Case
You're likely going to need to cover a lot of ground, going from class to your study group to work and back home again. It's not always possible to find an outlet to charge your smartphone, so pick up a phone charging case to help extend the battery life of your phone.
Bluetooth-capable Coffee Maker
Keep yourself motivated with a steady supply of coffee, late into the night — or even when you're not at home. The market is becoming more populated with coffee makers that you can start or program from afar via a Bluetooth connection and smartphone app.
Heated Travel Mug
Don't worry about your coffee or tea getting cold on those long trips to campus in the wee hours. Simply plug your mug's adapter into your car's dashboard and keep that beverage steaming.
Charging Backpack
Some of the most popular backpack makers are getting into smart technology by way of developing backpacks that can charge other devices. Whether they're powered by their own rechargeable batteries or even solar powered, you'll never have to deal with a dead device again.
Tablet
This may seem like too obvious a choice, but a tablet is simply a must-have for any student. Much more portable than even a small laptop, a tablet can allow you to more easily take notes or browse the Web during class and can even lighten your load by reducing the number of physical books you need to carry around.
Fitness Monitors
All those late nights and early mornings can wreak havoc on your diet and metabolism. Make sure you're keeping yourself in check with a wearable fitness device that can help you track your sleep, activity and diet habits.
External Hard Drive
Anything can happen to your computer, whether it's a power surge or virus. Make sure your important documents, like that paper that's due tomorrow, are safe by backing everything up to an external hard drive.
Smartphone
You already have one of these, right? Well, did you know that it can be used for more than just Candy Crush? Must-have apps for grad students include money management apps and food delivery services.

Americans who own a smartphone
Pen-sized Scanner
Note-taking is made even easier with pen-sized scanners that you can use like digital highlighters.
Headphones
A great pair of headphones will help you keep your focus on your work but still allow you to interact with the world around you, as many models can interface with your phone.
Virtual Keyboard
A laser-projected keyboard gives you the full functionality of a QWERTY keyboard without having to carry another bulky item with you.
Smartwatch
Now that pretty much all the biggest tech companies are offering smartwatches, you can help keep yourself on task and on time, as you view notifications and control your phone, all from your wrist.
Laptop Lock
This may not be exactly high-tech, but keep your laptop, one of your biggest investments, safe by locking it down.
Cooling Pad
Keep your laptop functioning well by using a cooling pad or fan to keep your computer from overheating.

One Last Dance for the Capitalist Pigs by Julien LallevÃ© is the debut of a new and exciting voice in independent gaming. The creativity and boldness on display here is as stunning as the garish, cartoony scenery and atmosphere. The game shares some sensibilities with Gravity Bone and its sequel, but One Last Dance is a truly original creation (and it's considerably longer than those). With gloriously low-poly graphics and an absurd wit, the game takes you to a place you've never seen before, and it does so with style.
After getting completely fed up with how the gameshow "The Fortune Roulette" preys on human misery, you decide to hunt down the (actual) pig responsible for it. You travel to the island where the television studios are located and proceed to climb and platform your way to the top of the giant structure there. The architecture in the game is insane and vertiginous, but fortunately the jumping feels spot-on. There are also some light stealth elements to spice things up, and plenty of dialogue with the locals.
The game is playable in English or French, and the English translation is just slightly awkward, adding to surreality of the proceedings. The characters are bizarre and memorable, and you'll have to talk to several of them to get to your ultimate goal. There are several tasks that must be performed in order to gain access to the studios, and you'll need the aid of others who share your desires.
One Last Dance for the Capitalist Pigs is weird, cool, and bursting with originality. It's a must-play.

Your voice in the energy debates: Learn how to support nuclear power.
Award-winning author Meredith Joan Angwin guides you in your pro-nuclear advocacy, from a day when you are quietly typing at your computer to the day when you might take the microphone in front of a legislative committee.
The book contains anecdotes, examples and insights, both from the author and from many other nuclear advocates. It will inspire and support your work toward a clean energy future.
People who appreciate the environmental, financial and reliability advantages of nuclear power are often unsure about they can show their support.
In this book, you will learn:
How you can support nuclear energy, simply sitting at your computer
How to support nuclear energy in public, using the same techniques as professional speakers and communicators
How to speak at a public hearing, or be invited to speak to a legislative committee
How to deal with your own emotions, in a world saturated with anti-nuclear messages
How you can find other nuclear supporters, and have fun together
Campaigning for Clean Air: The book is available!
Pro-nuclear people can make important contributions to the energy debate. This book will help you make your voice heard. Advocates appreciate the importance of nuclear power for clean air and for our planet's future.
In this book, award-winning author Meredith Angwin guides you in your advocacy:
Support nuclear energy in public, using the same techniques as professional speakers and communicators
Speak at a public hearing or be invited to speak to a legislative committee
Learn how to deal with your own emotions in a world saturated with anti-nuclear messages
Find other nuclear supporters and have fun together.
Campaigning for Clean Air features anecdotes, examples and insights from many pro-nuclear advocates. This book will inspire your work for a clean energy future. Nuclear energy is the cleanest, safest and most compact way to make electricity.
In her book, Campaigning for Clean Air, Meredith Angwin presents clear and well-referenced reasons for supporting nuclear energy. These sections of the book are based on her years of experience in energy research and on-site problem-solving.
The book includes five easy-to-read, well-referenced “white papers” on nuclear power. These papers cover:
Nuclear power for clean air
Nuclear safety (normal operations)
Analysis of the big accidents
Nuclear energy for efficient land use
Nuclear energy around the world
Why this book?
This book is a little different. Campaigning for Clean Air has the subtitle: Strategies for Pro-Nuclear Advocacy. It's about getting the pro-nuclear word out to the world.
Angwin's fear is that with all the pro-nuclear books, pro-nuclear people will read the books and enjoy the books and then….Then what? We pro-nuclear people have to raise our voices to support nuclear power.
That is why Angwin wrote Campaigning for Clean Air. This book is about how to support nuclear energy, with some discussion (of course) about why to support it.
As one of Angwin's friends said: “Your book is a guidebook, a sort of how-to.” Exactly right. How to write a letter to the editor. How to organize a rally. And everything in between.
Meredith's Technical Background
Meredith Angwin (right) has an undergraduate (special honors) and a graduate degree in chemistry from the University of Chicago.
In her chemistry career, Meredith led research to improve power plants and energy infrastructures. Her work included improvements and evaluations of nuclear plants, gas-fired plants, gas pipelines, geothermal power plants, hydro penstocks, coal plants, and geothermal energy.
She is inventor on several patents. Her consulting company worked with clients on corrosion control for the power industry.
What Others Are Saying
Nuclear is now gaining recognition as not only desirable but necessary in the effort to provide needed energy for the world in an environmentally responsible manner. Meredith's book provides practical tools for nuclear advocates to ensure that our existing nuclear assets are preserved and that new nuclear power facilities are licensed. This book is a must-read for anyone engaging with the public on
nuclear power issues. — Eugene S. Grecheck, Past President, American Nuclear Society
At last—a practical, clearly voiced guidebook to approaching nuclear power. I heartily endorse Meredith Angwin's important guidebook about how to talk about the cleanest and safest source of base-load power we have. A scientist and a communications expert, her writing is direct and natural, fl ows well, and speaks directly to how people wishing to better support nuclear power can learn to spread the word. — Gwyneth Cravens, author of Power to Save the World: The Truth About Nuclear Energy
So many would-be pro-nuclear advocates stop before they even start, daunted by the success of the anti-nuclear movement and overwhelmed by the seemingly endless negative press about nuclear energy. Meredith's book is the antidote to the “why bother?” mindset that has ossified the nuclear industry for decades. Her book demystifi es the advocacy process with no-nonsense advice, practical strategies, and step-by-step instructions for building an advocacy practice and achieving success. And don't forget to share some brownies! — Andrea Jennetta, Publisher, Fuel Cycle Week
Turning enthusiasm into organized, responsible advocacy, Meredith Angwin has been on the forefront of nuclear advocacy for years and she shares her experiences and lessons learned. This is far more than a “how-to manual”; it is a life's journey into greater understanding of how to responsibly address public concerns over nuclear power or any technically complex issue. — Dr. Dale E. Klein, Former Chairman, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
Meredith Angwin's Campaigning for Clean Air: Strategies for Pro Nuclear Advocacy brings me back to my own emergence as a nuclear advocate during the Vermont Yankee era. This book is a primer for nuclear advocacy, and a fascinating guidebook and educational tool.— Thomas P. Salmon, Governor of Vermont (1972–1977)
Meredith Angwin's book Campaigning for Clean Air: Strategies for Pro-Nuclear Advocacy, is now available on Amazon! You can buy it as a Kindle, or you can buy it as a paperback.

“More Black men are in prison or jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850, before the Civil War began,” Michelle Alexander told a standing room only house at the Pasadena Main Library, the first of many jarring points she made in a riveting presentation.
Alexander, currently a law professor at Ohio State, had been brought in to discuss her bestseller, The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness . Interest ran so high beforehand that the organizers had to move the event to a location that could accommodate the eager attendees. That evening, more than 200 people braved the pouring rain and inevitable traffic jams to crowd into the library's main room, with dozens more shuffled into an overflow room, and even more latecomers turned away altogether. Alexander and her topic had struck a nerve.
Growing crime rates over the past 30 years don't explain the skyrocketing numbers of black — and increasingly brown — men caught in America's prison system, according to Alexander, who clerked for Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun after attending Stanford Law. “In fact, crime rates have fluctuated over the years and are now at historical lows.”
“Most of that increase is due to the War on Drugs, a war waged almost exclusively in poor communities of color,” she said, even though studies have shown that whites use and sell illegal drugs at rates equal to or above blacks. In some black inner-city communities, four of five black youth can expect to be caught up in the criminal justice system during their lifetimes.
As a consequence, a great many black men are disenfranchised, said Alexander — prevented because of their felony convictions from voting and from living in public housing, discriminated in hiring, excluded from juries, and denied educational opportunities.
“What do we expect them to do?” she asked, who researched her ground-breaking book while serving as Director of the Racial Justice Project at the ACLU of Northern California. “Well, seventy percent return to prison within two years, that's what they do.”
Organized by the Pasadena Public Library and the Flintridge Center, with a dozen or more cosponsors, including the ACLU Pasadena/Foothills Chapter and Neighborhood Church, and the LA Progressive as the sole media sponsor, the event drew a crowd of the converted, frankly — more than two-thirds from Pasadena's well-established black community and others drawn from activists circles. Although Alexander is a polished speaker on a deeply researched topic, little she said stunned the crowd, which, after all, was the choir. So the question is what to do about this glaring injustice.
Married to a federal prosecutor, Alexander briefly touched on the differing opinion in the Alexander household. “You can imagine the arguments we have,” Alexander said in relating discussions she has with her husband. “He thinks there are changes we can make within the system,” she said, agreeing that there are good people working on the issues and that improvements can be made. “But I think there has to be a revolution of some kind.”
However change is to come, a big impediment will be the massive prison-industrial system.
“If we were to return prison populations to 1970 levels, before the War on Drugs began,” she said. “More than a million people working in the system would see their jobs disappear.”
Of all African-American men that were born in 1965 or later with less than a high school diploma, 60 percent have a prison record (28 months median time served).

So it's like America's current war addiction. We have built a massive war machine — one bigger than all the other countries in the world combined — with millions of well-paid defense industry jobs and billions of dollars at stake. With a hammer that big, every foreign policy issue looks like a nail — another bomb to drop, another country to invade, another massive weapons development project to build.
Similarly, with such a well-entrenched prison-industrial complex in place — also with a million jobs and billions of dollars at stake — every criminal justice issue also looks like a nail — another prison sentence to pass down, another third strike to enforce, another prison to build in some job-starved small town, another chance at a better life to deny.
Alexander, who drew her early inspiration from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., devotes the last part of “The New Jim Crow” to steps people can take to combat this gross injustice. In particular, she recommended supporting the Drug Policy Alliance. At the book signing afterwards, Dr. Anthony Samad recruited Michelle Alexander to appear this fall at one his Urban Issues Forums, typically held at the California African American Museum next to USC.

As a couples therapist, I used a variety of techniques to help people develop an approach to sex that would last. (I wrote about the underlying problems here.) First and foremost, however, was helping the couple see the importance of in meeting each other's sexual needs. Whether they had devolved into a pursuer of sex and a distributor of sex, or whether they were using sex as a bargaining chip or a power play, or whether they were using disinterest in sex as a protective strategy, couples often needed to wrap their minds around the necessity and benefits of meeting each other's needs. The single step of establishing teamwork is probably more important than all the other ideas on how to implement teamwork.
1. Curtail the resentment that is bound to infect any two people living together by actively appreciating the fact that your partner is not a robot. Further, acknowledge that many of your partner's apparent faults might stem from traits you love. Just as no one can be and reticent, or relaxed and driven, no one can make a great space to live in and not get upset about how the space is treated, and no one can accept the role of primary earner and not be sensitive to concerns about not making enough. Remind yourself how lucky you are to be with a real person.
2. Stop having (or, at least, of) spontaneous sex. Of all the images that haunt couples from Hollywood and from their own early days, spontaneous sex is the worst. At the beginning, like , you're just trying to get each other alone, and you're pawing each other whenever possible. But seriously, what are the odds that both members of a lasting couple will be in the same mood at the same time? By outlawing spontaneous sex, you open the door to more sustainable practices. I'm not completely against it any more than I am completely against spontaneous dinner, but planning a time to eat works better.
The single most important reason to give up spontaneous sex is that it opens the door to physical affection. In many couples, an expression of physical (or even verbal) affection worries the recipient that it is actually foreplay. Both parties can offer and accept caresses, compliments, and kisses if they know it won't lead to sex.
3. Issue rain checks. One way to keep spontaneous sex on the table (so to speak) without letting it kill displays of affection is to adopt a policy with respect to saying no. If you hit on your partner and get told no, your partner has 48 hours (or 24, or whatever) to make good. This gives the couple a way to try and fail without feeling “shot down,” and it gives the less avid member the needed space to get in the mood or set aside some time. While you're at it, if neither of you is particularly interested, make sure you schedule sex at least once a week (or whatever).
4. Take turns. Perhaps no perfectionistic sex standard is more useless than the quest for the simultaneous . Besides inviting simulated orgasms, and besides—along with the quest for spontaneous sex—making a perfectly enjoyable sexual experience seem to fall short, simultaneous orgasm robs you of the chance to enjoy your partner's orgasm. In my opinion, people hunt for the simultaneous orgasm not because of its inherent pleasures but because they are too self-conscious about pursuing their own sexual pleasure unless their partners are distracted by their own. But simultaneous sex makes no more sense than simultaneous massage. Of course you can massage each other's feet at the same time, but isn't it better when one person fully enjoys the massage and then the other does in turn? And when it comes to massaging the back, it's not even possible, by which I mean to suggest that taking turns during sex opens the way to doing things for each other that can't be done all at once. Taking turns allows you to concentrate on your own pleasure when it's your turn. If you have trouble doing so in front of your partner, buy a blindfold for one of you. If you are prone to lose interest after orgasm, you'll need to go second.
Taking turns also allows partners to skip a turn if they're feeling generous but not sexy.
5. Choreograph sexual activity that works for both people. There are two kinds of sexual sessions to choreograph for, one where both people are in the mood and one where only one is. Each couple has to balance the wishes of one party and the reasonable limits of the other. Whether the limits are reasonable is usually clear but can be a topic of discussion. Physical pain, physical ability, qualms, and distaste or disgust can all create limits, although it is important to recognize how often open discussion of sexual preferences tends to push back moral qualms and distaste, especially when the subject at hand is fantasy and not enactment. (People can usually find a way to embrace their partners' of including a third person, for example, even if they remain adamant against actually including a third person.) Given how pleasurable sex is to humans, it is always possible to find an activity that is gratifying to both people, analogous perhaps to finding a restaurant in a fairly large city that will satisfy both people.
Sometimes, though, only one person is in the mood. In that case, activities need to be choreographed that can satisfy that one person without overly inconveniencing, annoying, or intruding on the other. Each partner must always have the option of saying yes to sex while declining to take a turn, whether immediately or when the rain check comes due. Depending on the two people's preferences, a variety of acts can satisfy the one in the mood while not overly intruding on the other one, rather like the way one person might give the other a shoulder rub after a tense day—as a kindness or as a teammate in achieving satisfaction.
6. . Take some pressure off your partner, discover new fantasies, and acknowledge your and your ability to satisfy it to some extent. Don't build up resentment toward the Good Man for not always being available when you can keep some Nutty Buddies in the freezer under your own control.
7. Date your partner. I don't just mean having date nights; I mean dressing well for the love of your life, not just for relative strangers. Don't repeat stories to that your partner has already heard. Don't stuff your all day long and snipe at your partner; instead, stay tuned to your partner and snipe at everyone else if necessary. And stay in shape (proportionately to your age and overall ) and keep your hair clean and styled in your ongoing effort to make yourself appealing to the one person who really matters. Get better underwear. Pick your nose in private.
8. Expose yourself; get kinky. Nearly everyone harbors fears of sexual rejection, whether stemming from repressive for sexuality, from developing a sexual as a child and therefore as an incompetent, or from associating sex with the body and knowing that it is always the flesh that disappoints the mind and not the other way around. Showing your sexuality to another person is an extraordinarily intimate act, and it can bring with it the fears and the reliefs that mimic or perhaps reproduce the feeling of falling in love. Exposing your fantasies to your partner will give sex an edge that is otherwise lacking in ongoing . No matter how accepting your partner is, you know you have details whose revelation would make you feel you are flying without a net. This strategy is the cure for any concerns raised by all the other strategies that sex will be routine and mundane. If you do this gradually, you will get plenty of information about whether a particular brand of fantasy puts off your partner before you reveal something you can't take back. Or even better, you can start a discussion about which variations your partner can't stomach, so you can avoid these. Conversely, as your partner reveals sexual fantasies to you, encourage any avenue that doesn't repulse you by suggesting details yourself.
Regular sex with your life partner is a picnic and a brass band. You don't really need the fireworks, too.
The area I grew up in, leafy Wimbledon in south-west London, is bordered by memorials to two towering historical figures. One side dedicates its streets and walls to the legacy of the abolitionist William Wilberforce: the remnants of a house where he lounged with his friends, and the mounting block he used to get on his horse to ride to the Houses of Parliament, still stand.
The other side is devoted to Admiral Horatio Nelson, who having defeated the French navy bought a romantic estate where he stayed with his lover, Emma Hamilton. So many streets, pubs, shops and other local businesses recall this history that local estate agents refer to the area as The Battles.
Confederate statues removed across southern US states – in pictures Read more
These two contemporaneous, though contrasting, histories are symbolic of the problems Britain faces in confronting its past. Wilberforce, unquestionably a force for good, helped end, in 1807, Britain's official involvement in the transatlantic slave trade. But he was not alone. The enormous contribution of black people in Britain at the time – especially activists and writers who were slaves themselves – has no equivalent site of glory, in London or anywhere in the country.
One of the obstacles all these abolitionists had to overcome was the influence of Nelson, who was what you would now call, without hesitation, a white supremacist. While many around him were denouncing slavery, Nelson was vigorously defending it. Britain's best known naval hero – so idealised that after his death in 1805 he was compared to no less than “the God who made him” – used his seat in the House of Lords and his position of huge influence to perpetuate the tyranny, serial rape and exploitation organised by West Indian planters, some of whom he counted among his closest friends.
It is figures like Nelson who immediately spring to mind when I hear the latest news of confederate statues being pulled down in the US. These memorials – more than 700 of which still stand in states including Virginia, Georgia and Texas – have always been the subject of offence and trauma for many African Americans, who rightly see them as glorifying the slavery and then segregation of their not so distant past. But when these statues begin to fulfil their intended purpose of energising white supremacist groups, the issue periodically attracts more mainstream interest.
Despite student protests, Oxford University's statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes has not been taken down
The reaction in Britain has been, as in the rest of the world, almost entirely condemnatory of neo-Nazis in the US and of its president for failing to denounce them. But when it comes to our own statues, things get a little awkward. The colonial and pro-slavery titans of British history are still memorialised: despite student protests, Oxford University's statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes has not been taken down; and Bristol still celebrates its notorious slaver Edward Colston. When I tweeted this weekend that it's time we in Britain look again at our own landscape, the reaction was hostile.
“I don't want that nonsense spreading here from America. Past is, we have moved on,” one person said. Another accused me of being a “#ClosetRacist” for even raising the question. But the most common sentiment was summed up in this tweet: “Its History – we cant & shouldn't re-write it – we learn from it. Removing statues would make us no different to terrorists at Palmyra.” Therein lies the point. Britain has committed unquantifiable acts of cultural terrorism – tearing down statues and palaces, and erasing the historical memory of other great civilisations during an imperial era whose supposed greatness we are now, so ironically, very precious about preserving intact.
And we knew what we were doing at the time. One detail that has always struck me is how, when the British destroyed the centuries-old Summer Palace in Beijing in 1860 and gave a little dog they'd stolen as a gift to Queen Victoria, she humorously named it “Looty”. This is one of the long list of things we are content to forget while sucking on the opium of “historical integrity” we claim our colonial statues represent.
We have “moved on” from this era no more than the US has from its slavery and segregationist past. The difference is that America is now in the midst of frenzied debate on what to do about it, whereas Britain – in our inertia, arrogance and intellectual laziness – is not.
The statues that remain are not being “put in their historical context”, as is often claimed. Take Nelson's column. Yes, it does include the figure of a black sailor, cast in bronze in the bas-relief. He was probably one of the thousands of slaves promised freedom if they fought for the British military, only to be later left destitute, begging and homeless, on London's streets when the war was over.
The storm around America's statues isn't about history. It's about whiteness | Eddie S Glaude, Jr Read more
But nothing about this “context” is accessible to the people who crane their necks in awe of Nelson. The black slaves whose brutalisation made Britain the global power it then was remained invisible, erased and unseen.
The people so energetically defending statues of Britain's white supremacists remain entirely unconcerned about righting this persistent wrong. They are content to leave the other side of the story where it is now – in Nelson's case, among the dust and the pigeons, 52 metres below the admiral's feet. The message seems to be that is the only place where the memory of the black contribution to Britain's past belongs.

Detroit — Detroit has had more homes foreclosed in the past 10 years than the total number of houses in several suburbs — or all of Buffalo, New York.
Since 2005, more than 1-in-3 Detroit properties — 139,699 of 384,672 — have been foreclosed because of mortgage defaults or unpaid taxes, property records show. The vast majority are houses, and the tally is so huge it shocked even those who spent years working on foreclosure in Detroit.
"When you see it on a map, it's absolutely terrifying," said Chris Uhl, a vice president of the Skillman Foundation that is working to prevent foreclosures.
To get a sense of the loss, consider all the houses in Warren, Livonia, Royal Oak, Southfield and Allen Park.
Empty them. The number is still less than all the foreclosures in Detroit.
"Even if you are deeply involved, you can't help but be staggered by these numbers," said Steve Tobocman, a former state representative who served as co-director of the Michigan Foreclosure Task Force.
> Explore a database and map of tax-foreclosed homes in Detroit
"It's not just 140,000 properties. It's people living in those properties. The number of lives affected is just staggering."
The Detroit News compiled its findings using records from CoreLogic and RealtyTrac, real estate tracking firms, and the Wayne County Treasurer's Office, which forecloses on homes after three years of tax nonpayment. The News' analysis is the first to combine both types of foreclosure, giving a better sense of damage that some say is comparable to a natural disaster.
In Detroit, homes lost to foreclosure are often never re-occupied: 76 percent of the 84,000 properties on the city's blight list are foreclosures, according an inventory of housing conditions by the Detroit Blight Task Force.
Taxpayers pay for the damage, from demolition costs and declining property values to diminished quality of life. On the 8200 block of Faust near Joy on the city's west side, city crews last fall razed six bungalows that had been foreclosed since 2005. Much work remains: All but seven of 24 homes on the block have been foreclosed in the past 10 years.
CLOSE Talise Banks talks about the past decade, when homeowners could not meet mortgage payments and keep up the appearance of their houses. Clarence Tabb Jr., The Detroit News
"People come around and see no neighbors, so they steal, rob and strip," said Talise Banks, 30, a single mother of two young boys. "They come by, take out windows, hot water heaters and whatever else from homes. There're just a lot of problems."
When she bought in 2002, all homes on the block were occupied. Her mortgage payment is $900 per month for a home appraised at $5,000. She owes $82,000 on the mortgage for the 900-square-foot home.
Banks said she's lost more in break-ins than her home is worth today: Four TVs, a laptop, a tablet, a digital camera, a lawn mower and more.
“You don't keep anything valuable here. Young guys are always trying to get in. I'd like to get some expensive stuff, but with no alarm system, I'd be a fool.” Lem Wade, Faust Street resident
By her count, there are more raccoons, 18, in one empty house on the block than there are people. There are about 10 people, including her neighbor, Lem Wade.
"You don't keep anything valuable here," said Wade, who has lived in a rental on Faust for five years. "Young guys are always trying to get in. I'd like to get some expensive stuff, but with no alarm system, I'd be a fool."
More foreclosures are on the way. Wayne County Treasury officials plan to foreclose on another 28,545 city properties for nonpayment of taxes at online auctions this fall. About 10,000 are occupied, and county officials extended the deadline to make payment plans to June 8.
Daren Blomquist, a vice president at RealtyTrac, a California company that tracks real estate, said the double whammy of tax and mortgage foreclosures accelerates the decline of neighborhoods.
Detroit is fourth in mortgage foreclosures over the past 10 years, behind Las Vegas, Phoenix and Chicago. But Detroit had far more tax foreclosures, 110,000, than those cities, and its housing prices have slumped the most: Homes sold for $22,000 on average in the city last fall, down 73 percent from its peak before the housing market crash, RealtyTrac records show.
That is by far the lowest among 50 big cities. Cleveland was second lowest with $66,000. The fall national average for home sale prices was $193,000.
"It's almost unbelievable unless you drive by and see houses selling for $500," Blomquist said. "No matter how you look at the data, Detroit keeps popping up as having the deck stacked against it."
Kurt Metzger, director emeritus of Data Driven Detroit and mayor of Pleasant Ridge, analyzed foreclosures for Detroit's Office of Foreclosure Prevention and Response. He said foreclosure "affected everything: housing stock, neighborhoods. It exacerbated crime, blight, the loss of city services and taxable incomes."
Those losses are harder to quantify.
Detroit's population fell by nearly 240,000 residents from 2000 to 2010, to about 700,000. The foreclosure crisis raged for at least five of those years, and Metzger said there's "certainly an argument that many residents were forced out" of the city by foreclosure, but it's impossible to determine.
Declining property values alone cost Detroiters an estimated $1.3 billion in personal wealth in 2012, according to a 2013 report by an anti-foreclosure group, the Alliance for a Just Society.
Add in incalculable costs of arson, blight, crime — as well as social costs — and Tobocman said foreclosure's toll on Detroit rivals that experienced in the 1967 riots. That unrest cost $100 million in property damage — $700 million in today's dollars — and accelerated a population decline that had already begun in Detroit.
"In terms of tax base, destruction to the physical landscape and the number of people disappearing from the city, this (foreclosure crisis) may have been the most devastating," said Tobocman, who lives in southwest Detroit and is director of Global Detroit, a group that works to increase immigration to the city.
Detroit has averaged 15,000 to 25,000 foreclosures a year since 2006. In the late 2000s, the vast majority were mortgage foreclosures. Last year, the vast majority were tax foreclosures.
Either way, the result is often the same: An abandoned building in a city with too many of them.
It's a crisis that quietly unfolds every Thursday in the 13th floor auditorium of the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center, where sheriff's officials auction bank-foreclosed properties.
Late last year, Renee Jester attended the sale and wondered if she'd be homeless by the end of it.
She's rented a home on Mansfield near Outer Drive on the west side since February 2014. The home's owners stopped paying the mortgage, owing Fidelity Bank $27,591 and leading to a foreclosure notice.

"I'm hysterical. I don't know what to do —
if I'm going to need to find somewhere else or what," Jester said. "I'm a nervous wreck."
By law, bidders have to pay $1 more than is owed or the property reverts to the lender. Mortgage holders then have six months to work out a deal.
Jester rocked in her seat during the auction. Three Detroit homes sold. All fetched less than $1,000, including a bungalow on Grandville in northwest Detroit that sold for $470. In November 2008, at the dawn of the meltdown, the same house sold for $86,667, property records show.
The deputy read Jester's address. No bids. She wouldn't lose the home that day.
"Thank God," Jester said, as her hands shook and held a foreclosure notice.
The reprieve is temporary.
The so-called redemption period ends in late June, when the bank can take possession of the home and evict Jester.
By the numbers
36 percent of all Detroit properties went through foreclosure from 2005 to 2014.
139,699 total homes foreclosed.
56 percent of all mortgage foreclosures are blighted, need to be demolished or have been foreclosed again for nonpayment of taxes.
76 percent of the 84,000 properties on the city's blight list are foreclosures.

Nobody wants the government in their bedroom, but the FDA has issued a public notification that Stiff Bull Herbal Coffee has a “hidden drug ingredient” that gives men erections with every cup. So if you're out of that little blue pill, grab a coffee mug from the cupboard.
The FDA press release says:
FDA laboratory analysis confirmed that Stiff Bull Herbal Coffee contains desmethyl carbodenafil. Desmethyl carbodenafil is structurally similar to sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, an FDA-approved prescription drug for erectile dysfunction (ED). This undeclared ingredient may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs such as nitroglycerin and may lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Men with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease often take nitrates.
The Independent interviewed the Keith Hanson of Stiff Bull who has responded to this FDA press release. It can be found here.
Afghanistan has warned it will stop trucks carrying cargo from Pakistan from entering its territory from January 20 if Islamabad does not permit Afghan trucks to go up to the Wagah land border crossing with India.
Pakistani officials had agreed during a transit and trade cooperation conference held recently in Islamabad that Afghan trucks would be allowed to travel directly to the Wagah border and Karachi seaport after January 20.
However, 500 containers with Afghan goods were currently held up in Pakistan, said Musafer Qoqandi, spokesman of the Afghan Ministry of Commerce and Industries.
If Pakistan does not allow commercial vehicles from Afghanistan to pass directly to the Wagah crossing by January 20, the Afghan government will begin stopping Pakistani trucks from passing through its borders, the ministry said.
"Pakistan officials have promised to let Afghan trucks go to Wagah port after January 20. Otherwise, (the) Afghan government does not have any other way but to give a similar response," Qoqandi was quoted as saying by Tolo News, a leading Afghan channel.
Documentation issues, high fees and increased cost of Pakistani transit vehicles are among the problems that have stopped Afghan exporters from taking advantage of trade routes in Pakistan, officials said.
"We have said this several times that Pakistan is not committed to its promises and even after the president's talks with their officials, Pakistanis still do not stand on their promises," said Atiqullah Nasrat, Chairman of the Afghan Chamber of Commerce and Industries Board.
The Afghan officials pointed out that huge amounts of Pakistani goods are transported through Afghanistan to Central Asian countries every day.
Transit trade between the two countries is governed by the Afghan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement that came into force in June 2011. The pact, brokered by the US, allows Afghan trucks to carry goods up to the Wagah border crossing. However, Afghan trucks are barred from carrying Indian exports on their return journey from Wagah.
Pakistan recently refused to allow Afghanistan to transport its goods up to the Wagah border with India, claiming this was not permitted under the bilateral transit trade pact.

They say it's what is on the inside that counts. But that is not true for topological insulators — exotic materials that conduct electricity only along their surfaces. Physicists have now demonstrated this property in a naturally occurring mineral for the first time1.
Their findings could boost efforts to build spintronic devices — in which currents are driven by an intrinsic property of electrons called spin, rather than by voltages. The results could also help the design of quantum computers that would use spin to encode information.
Predicted to exist in 20052, topological insulators were first synthesized from heavy elements in 20083. Their odd conducting abilities arise because each electron's spin becomes coupled to its motion. This relationship compels the electrons to circle around on the spot, preventing them from moving through the bulk material, so that they cannot conduct electricity.
But at the material's edge, the electrons do not have enough space for this circling motion; instead, they are forced to hop along the surface in semicircular jumps, enabling conduction.
Round and round
The thin conducting layer of a topological insulator makes it relatively easy for physicists to manipulate the spin current. “Topological insulators raise the possibility of building spintronic devices that use electron spin, rather than charge,” says Pascal Gehring, a solid-state physicist at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart, Germany, and a co-author of the latest study. Spins can be rotated quickly without expending much energy, so spintronic devices should be more efficient than their electronic counterparts, in which energy is required to change charges, he adds.
Physicists attempting to construct quantum computers that would outperform the best current machines are also interested in encoding information in electron spins, rather than whether a current is on or off. In theory, it is difficult to corrupt these values in a topological insulator, because of the link between spin and motion. To flip the spin value accidentally, you would have knocked the system hard enough to cause the electron to make a complete U-turn, explains Gehring.
Gehring and his colleagues examined a natural sample of the mineral kawazulite, which contains bismuth, tellurium, selenium and sulphur, found at a former gold mine in the Czech Republic. They cleaved off single crystalline sheets 0.7 millimetres wide, and subjected them to the standard test for a topological insulator: photoelectron spectroscopy. This involves measuring the properties of electrons dislodged from a material when ultraviolet light is fired at its surface.
Their results, published in Nano Letters1, confirm that the electrons' energy and momentum distribution matches predictions for a topological insulator.
Feng Liu, a materials scientist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, notes that kawazulite has been synthesized in the past, but that topological insulators built in the lab always have structural defects that create unwanted conduction in the bulk.
“Surprisingly, the team's natural sample is cleaner than synthesized samples — even though you would expect it to be more dirty,” says Liu. “It may turn out to be cheaper to use a natural supply of topological insulators than it is to make, process and clean them in the lab.”
Offshore Worker Falls To Death
393 SHARES Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Linkedin
An offshore worker has fallen to his death on a platform operated by Brazilian state run oil firm Petrobras.
The worker has been named as 29 year old Victor Geraldo Brito, an employee of subcontractor RIP Industrial Services – a company owned by German based KAEFER.
Offshore Worker Falls To Death
Mr Brito is believed to have fallen around 12m, whilst working onboard the PCH-2 platform located in the Campos Basin, and did not survive the impact.
Speaking on incident, Brazilian workers union, Sindipetro-NF, said: “At the same time expresses its condolences to the worker's family in this time of grief, the union condemns the job insecurity that has led to hundreds of deaths, mutilations and illnesses in the Campos Basin in recent years.”
Director of Sindipetro-NF, Wilson Reis, has since flown to the platform, to take part in the investigation in to Mr Brito's death.
"While New Myth/Old Science deliberately avoids any obvious Ra intergalactic tones, it's joyful enough to make a visitor from Saturn smile." – DownBeat
Commissioned by Experimental Sound Studio (ESS), the music was created in response to material contained in ESS's vast Sun Ra Audio Archive. Rather than a Sun Ra tribute, Reed and Adasiewicz have crafted a melodically rich, harmonically expansive body of themes orchestrated from fragments extracted from a rehearsal tape marked "NY 1961", featuring Ra on electric piano, John Gilmore on tenor sax and flute, and Ronnie Boykins on bass.
The tunes on Old Myth/New Science were written by the co-leaders based on the 1961 tape. That tape contains no compositions per-se, but there are a lot of stream-of-consciousness ideas and some of these ideas were teased out, hugely expanded upon and turned into the pieces heard here.
"The tape is clearly these ideas they're hashing out,” Adasiewicz says. “Some of this stuff sounds kind of squirrelly. Some is insanely beautiful....it became our personal arrangements."
"After figuring out the band, the first step in the process was to completely dismiss the idea of commenting or honoring Sun Ra," Reed says. "The more interesting idea was of creating new music using someone's unfinished, unwanted and abandoned material."
Reed and Adasiewicz fully considered the possibilities of taking this very unrefined material and teasing out raw ideas, bits and undeveloped fragments from it, and developing and composing them into full compositions that the band perform and make their own. The music is rich and exciting; full and sparse; mysterious and inviting; challenging and tuneful! And what a band!
For Mike Reed, there's something inherently amusing about assembling such a talent-laden crew to explore music that was discarded by Sun Ra. "We are bringing all these people together to make their mark," Reed says. "That was the premise. With so many leaders in the group and rising stars and collaborators, everybody is trying to make their way through this life. We're working in the shadows and you have to put a light on."
Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referenced Steven Lindhorst's membership as a Jehovah's Witness. Though he was a member when the alleged crimes occurred, he has since been disfellowshipped and, as a result, is no longer a member of the congregation.
Elders in the Jehovah's Witnesses church violated the confidentiality of a congregation member when they told police about an alleged confession he made regarding child pornography, according to a defense motion.
But, a judge ruled Wednesday, evidence seized after the alleged confession should not be suppressed because there was other information to justify a search of the congregation member's computer.
Steven Martin Lindhorst, 51, of Paso Robles is charged with two felonies for possessing child pornography and committing lewd acts with a child under 14.

Paso Robles police said Lindhorst had thousands of photos and videos on his computer that showed pubescent children engaging in sex acts. Some of them appeared to be manufactured by Lindhorst, according to the police.
Lindhorst, who is in jail on $160,000 bond, has pleaded not guilty.
According to his defense attorney, Guy Galambos, evidence seized from Lindhorst's computer should not be permitted in court because the search stemmed from a confession Lindhorst made to church elders, who later violated a clergy-penitent privilege.
That privilege, like attorney-client and therapist-patient privilege, is a legal concept protecting communications that are expected to be private.
According to a court motion filed by Galambos, the clergy-penitent privilege is “based on public policy to encourage people to seek the advice of and to be honest with their religious leaders.”
While that might be an issue at a future hearing regarding those statements, Deputy District Attorney Julie Antos said in court Wednesday that it should not impact the search warrant.
Lindhorst and his wife were both members of the Jehovah's Witnesses church at the time. According to a defense motion to suppress evidence, the following occurred:
On Dec. 27, 2014, Lindhorst and his wife met with two church elders after his wife claimed she had caught him viewing child pornography on his computer six months earlier. Lindhorst had denied viewing child pornography when confronted by his wife and during his initial conversation with the elders.
On Dec. 31, Lindhorst returned from work to find his computer, hard drive and wife gone. That night, Lindhorst spoke to one of his elders and “confessed” to his use of child pornography, in order to prevent his wife from moving out.
According to the statement of probable cause used to obtain a search warrant, Lindhorst's wife arrived at the Paso Robles Police Department on Jan. 1 with her husband's computer and hard drive, which she could not access due to password protection. She said she'd witnessed him viewing photos of girls ages 13 to 15 in sexually suggestive poses six months earlier and on Dec. 27 had found what appeared to be girls underwear in a drawer next to her husband's computer.
She also said her husband had confessed to church elders.
Contacted by police, the elders said Lindhorst admitted to viewing or downloading child pornography since 1986.
In a declaration filed with the court July 2, Lindhorst claims he has been with the church since age 5 and attended ministerial training school in 1999. “Elders are trained to hold confidential any confessions made by members of the congregation,” he wrote.
On Dec. 31, he wrote, he made a confession to two elders. “The elders did not ask for my permission to tell others about my statements, and I did not give them my permission to tell anyone what I had told them.”
The elders should not have disclosed the confession, Galambos wrote in his motion. And that information should not have been used to obtain a search warrant. Without that information, he added, there would not have been enough evidence to justify a search of Lindhorst's computers since the photos Lindhorst's wife had seen depicted clothed children.
But according to the prosecution, the search warrant was based on the observations by Lindhorst's wife. Even if the photos depicted children in clothing, “a child does not have to be naked for a picture or video to be deemed child pornography,” according to Antos' motion.
Superior Court Judge Jacquelyn Duffy said even without the statements from the elders, there was enough evidence to justify a search warrant.
Lindhorst is set to appear in court again Aug. 8 for a trial-setting conference.
The St. Louis Blues are a great hockey franchise. They win. OK, they haven't won that, but they're successful year-after-year. In St. Louis we love the Blues. We support the Blues.
The Blues ownership group very clearly takes great pride in being in St. Louis. They're not going anywhere. Tom Stillman isn't Stan Kroenke. And everything we hear is that the Blues are a great community partner, often reaching out to support individuals and promote St. Louis, and often without any expectation of positive press.
All that said, let's have a conversation about the Blues, Scottrade Center, $160M, and the impact on St. Louis. In return for supporting a ~$160M renovation of the Blue's home arena, the team should relocate its practice facility and planned hockey center to the city.
First, a timeline of recent events. Toward the end of the effort to retain the NFL St. Louis Rams, the future of Scottrade Center was addressed. The guess was that a renovation in excess of $100M would be sought soon. Since then, the Blues have made headlines on and off the ice:
April: Missouri state lawmakers moved to bar any state funds from being spent on Scottrade renovations
May 23: Blues announced a $35M practice facility and hockey complex in Maryland Heights
May 24: St. Louis City's Land Clearance for Redevelopment Authority (LCRA) approves measure declaring intent to finance Scottrade renovations with $160M bond issue
May 25: Blues seasons ends in Conference Finals with 5-2 loss to San Jose Sharks
May 27: Preliminary plans place Scottrade renovation cost at $160M
June 2: Stadium Journey names Scottrade the 3rd best fan experience in the NHL
The state was riled up about Governor Nixon's support of a possible new NFL stadium with state money, perhaps after a cooling-off period there's funding there for the Blues. The Maryland Heights project “public-private partnership” appears to have caught the public off-guard, with numerous officials declining to comment. The May 25 LCRA resolution lays the groundwork for financing Scottrade renovations.
I'm skeptical of the economic value to cities of professional sports franchises. It's a rather mainstream skepticism. Still, I think it could make sense for the city to support Scottrade renovations (the arena hosts more than just the Blues, of course). We should support the Blues. We should also get something in return.
It may be easy for someone who visits downtown St. Louis only, or primarily, for sporting events, to see the city's heart as one-dimensional. “If it weren't for Blues games, I'd never go downtown!” Well the truth is, if someone only comes downtown for a game, that's not much of a benefit to downtown. Despite what seems like a busy setting, the crush of 20-30-40 thousand fans rushing in and out in a few hours isn't great for businesses or economic development.
Anyway, the city should get something in return for supporting Scottrade renovations, and with news that Green Street is exploring options to redevelop the Armory building, here's the idea:
The St. Louis Blues at The Armory
The imposing and prominent Armory building abutting I-64/40 near Grand Boulevard and just two miles west of Scottrade, was completed in 1937. As the name would imply, it served as the home of the 138th Infantry, calling the building home until at least the late 1950s. The Armory built, like well, a tank. In fact, tanks were stored in the underground parking area (perfect for today's hockey players and team executives). The building remained in use, hosting The Grateful Dead in 1968, and providing a young Arthur Ashe a place to play tennis (read more on the history of the Armory here).
But does the facility work? In short, yes. It's feasible. In fact, images of the interior reveal a main area that appears perfect for an ice rink. There's seating, a press box and suite area, and more. The building already has the aforementioned underground parking, and there's space for locker rooms, training facilities, and more. And the larger building to the east is now owned by Green Street. It could also house rinks, or replaced with a new multi-purpose facility.
One goal stated by the St. Louis Blues of its Maryland Heights plan is to spread to the sport of hockey, to engage youth in the sport. While Maryland Heights may be nearer the white middle class and existing hockey fans, a facility in the city, and adjacent to a MetroLink station and busy bus route, would do more to grow the game. An ice rink facility here would be accessible to more people, of more economic and racial diversity.
Restore a landmark building, gain a high-profile location, connect with a more diverse fan base, honor the military history, and the practice courts of Arthur Ashe, there's a lot to recommend the Armory. It's near the Lawrence Group's Cortex East proposed development, not far from the planned $500M Saint Louis University hospital project, and just south of that school's main campus.
The Armory would provide a much better experience for traveling teams and tournament attendees. The city offers assets that can be sparse in Maryland Heights and other suburban locations, including hotels and restaurants, and family attractions such as Union Station, City Museum, the Arch, Ikea, and everything in Forest Park.
The city serves as host to an unprofitable professional hockey team. There are some positive intangibles that go with that, though they would not be much diminished for the region if the Blues played games at its current practice facility location at an outlet mall. More than one pro team plays outside its namesake city, and no one really cares.
The impact of a facility used almost daily, for tournaments, for practice, for public skating, would be greater than that of the Blues at Scottrade itself. The city would see a greater benefit from being home to the practice facility and ice rinks, than the NHL's 41 home games.
For the Blues, either location would present a high-profile statement of its belief in the community. For the city, either option would help justify its financial support of Scottrade renovations. The city would be wise to ask for something in return for its investment, its representatives and residents would be wise to push the city to do so.

Sworn affidavits were filed Monday against the Florida Gators presently suspended for the team for alleged fraud. Seven of the players, including junior stars wide receiver Antonio Callaway and running back Jordan Scarlett, are facing a pair of third-degree felony charges.
Redshirt freshman defensive lineman Jordan Smith faces five third-degree felony charges, while freshman offensive lineman Kadeem Telfort faces roughly 30 third-degree felony charges.
Per the complaint filed against the players, investigators found that “students had added large amounts of funds electronically to their UF Bookstore debit accounts using one or several different credit cards that did not belong to them. Some of the students even saved the card for future charges. … The students then used the funds in their UF Bookstore debit accounts to purchase items from the UF Bookstore in person. … Most of the items purchased were electronics, including items such as laptops, iPads and Beats headphones.”
The two universal charges are for fraud (swindling property valued at under $20,000) and impersonation (using or possession of a person's identification without consent). Junior defensive lineman Keivonnis Davis, who was expected to see time as a rotational player this season, along with redshirt sophomore DL Richerd Desir-Jones, redshirt freshman WR Rick Wells and freshman linebackers James Houston IV and Ventrell Miller also received both charges. Smith was hit with three additional impersonation charges. Telfort faces the fraud charge, 13 impersonation charges (for forging names on food deliveries), 12 illegal use of credit card charges and three charges of passing off a false instrument.
Callaway, Scarlett, Desir-Jones and Miller each transferred slightly under $2,000 to their respective University of Florida accounts. Smith added over $3,500. Telfort and Davis transferred about $1,500, while Wells and Houston added under $1,000. Smith and Telfort attempted multiple transactions, may of which failed, though a handful were successful. Smith is also accused of using cards to pay an outstanding UF Transportation and Parking balance of nearly $1,500 and $800 in rent. Telfort is also accused of “multiple credit cards to make multiple transactions, including sending money to his UF account, purchasing items and ordering food.”
Scarlett allegedly used a card on another student's account (that of his girlfriend) in an attempt to hide the fraud and claimed that Smith added the funds to the account. He told her that the money added to her account was “from an agent in New York.” Wells told police that his girlfriend added the money to his account with her credit card, a statement she corroborated but one that contradicted the evidence.
Specific complaints also show that many of the players have already paid back the funds to settle their accounts.
Head coach Jim McElwain did not comment on the suspended players during his Monday press conference even as news broke about the charges while he was speaking. Athletic director Scott Stricklin released a statement hours later.
“We obviously took this matter very seriously as evidence[d] by Coach McElwain's decision to suspend the players immediately and indefinitely from all team activities,” he said> “We have respected the appropriate process from the beginning and will continue to do so.”
Per UF policy, students are generally suspended from school while facing felony charges. That means student-athletes like football players would be ineligible to compete under such circumstances.
However, pretrial diversion will likely be available from the state for most of the players. A common PTD would work to ensure players without criminal records do not ultimately face these charges as they would be forced to return the stolen funds, perform community service and take part in programs that prevent future criminal acts. One could see players in PTD potentially having their suspensions lifted with punishment being time served if allowed to continue in school.
However, players with prior records or a significant number of charges may not be offered PTD by the state attorney, which would severely limit Florida's ability to reinstate them this season … or possibly at all.
McElwain stated Monday during his press conference that the players were still enrolled in school at that time (as they had not yet been charged with felonies).
“Our team kind of had moved on and then we'll deal with whatever it is when it comes up,” he said. “I think there's one thing [the other players] have done a pretty good job of is dealing with some things.”
Below are the felony statutes with which the players are being charged:
Third-degree felony fraud: “Any person who engages in a scheme to defraud and obtains property thereby is guilty of organized fraud … if the amount of property obtained has an aggregate value of less than $20,000”
Third-degree felony fraud — impersonation: “Any person who willfully and without authorization fraudulently uses, or possesses with intent to fraudulently use, personal identification information concerning an individual without first obtaining that individual's consent, commits the offense of fraudulent use of personal identification information, which is a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided”
The Washington Auto Show isn't known as the place for hot new concepts or production models, but it does have its share of future vehicle tech, and the latest from Ford previews its plans for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) tech aimed at improving traffic, safety, and efficiency.
The first prototypes sporting Ford's V2V system are currently under construction with plans to tour the U.S. this spring. They'll feature the ability to communicate wirelessly with each other, relaying traffic hazards, congestion, and other information to help drivers navigate their routes.
Ford's technology works over a dedicated short-range WiFi system on a secure channel allocated by the FCC. Ford says the system one-ups radar safety systems by allowing full 360-degree coverage even when there's no direct line of sight. Scenarios where this could benefit safety or traffic? Predicting collision courses with unseen vehicles, seeing sudden stops before they're visible, and spotting traffic pattern changes on a busy highway.
As much as 81 percent of all passenger vehicle crashes where alcohol isn't a factor are due to such hazards, according to Ford. That amounts to over 4.3 million incidents each year. Ford wants to reduce that number.
Beyond the safety aspect, Ford says V2V technology, if applied on a national scale, could reduce wasted fuel spent in traffic delays. According to the Texas Transportation Intisute, about 3.9 billion gallons of fuel were wasted in traffic in 2009. That's a lot of gas--$808 worth for the average commuter.
V2V tech could eventually move beyond the cars themselves, leveraging handheld devices to bring the capability to cars. "Ford has pioneered connectivity in modern vehicles with SYNC," said Mike Shulman, technical leader of Ford research and advanced engineering. "We believe advanced Wi-Fi for intelligent vehicles could be added to smartphones or GPS systems and simply connect to SYNC like today's phones."
Or, as Paul Mascarenas, vice president of research and advanced engineering put it, "The day is not far off when our vehicles will operate like mobile devices with four wheels, constantly exchanging information and communicating with our environment to do things like shorten commute times, improve fuel economy and generally help us more easily navigate life on the road."
Prototype vehicles will also be delivered to the Department of Transportation for research and testing early this summer.
Suicide bomber who attacked Istanbul police was married to Norwegian ISIL jihadist
Toygun Atilla ISTANBUL
The woman from Russia's Daghestan Republic who allegedly executed a suicide bombing attack in central Istanbul on Jan. 6 was the wife of a Norwegian extremist of Chechen origin, with whom she spent three months in Istanbul and passed the Syrian border.After Turkish media reported the assailant's identity as Diana Ramazova, a Russian-language news website, Kavkazpress, reported that she was a Russian citizen from the Republic of Daghestan, who was “radicalized by the Wahhabi ideology.”Ramazova was the widow of Abu Aluevitsj Edelbijev, a Norwegian citizen of Chechen origin, who she had met online and married in 2014 in an Islamic religious ceremony, though it is not known where the ceremony was conducted. Edelbijev died in Syria in December 2014 fighting with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).The couple spent three months in Istanbul in 2014. Ramazova entered Turkey from Russia with a tourist visa in May 2014, while no entrance logs for Edelbijev have been found, raising the suspicion that he entered the country illegally.It is not known whether the couple spent the three months in Istanbul on a honeymoon or if they were participating in ISIL activities and meeting with fellow extremists while in the city.According to Turkish and Norwegian intelligence sources, Ramazova and Edelbijev traveled to Syria in July 2014, took the names “Sümeyra” and “İdris,” respectively, and fought for ISIL.Ramazova illegally reentered Turkey on Dec. 26, 2014, through the southeastern province of Gaziantep on the border with Syria, after Edelbijev was killed.She then allegedly proceeded to blow herself up on Jan. 6 at the Tourism Police Station in Sultanahment, one of Istanbul's most popular tourist districts, killing one policeman, Kenan Kumaş. It is not yet known where she obtained the grenades she used for the explosion.Before the suicide bomber's identity was revealed by the authorities, the outlawed Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front (DHKP/C) claimed the attack.However, the family of the alleged DHKP/C bomber, identified as Elif Sultan Kalsen, said the body at the morgue did not belong to their daughter.
If Anshu Jain and Jürgen Fitschen had been searching for a title for their joint appearance last week, "The Inseparables" would have been a fitting choice. The new co-CEOs of Deutsche Bank were constantly putting their heads together, whispering to each other and then turning to the assembled journalists in Frankfurt to explain that they -- "Jürgen and I" or "Anshu and I" -- planned to turn Deutsche Bank into a better company.
But to the two men, another message was even more important than the avowal of their close partnership, namely that Deutsche Bank, too, is inseparable.
Jain and Fitschen made it clear that they intend to transform Deutsche Bank into the world's leading universal bank. When responding to the question of what would happen to their strategy if politicians were serious about their plans to split up large banks, the two top executives feigned innocence. "We have no plan B," said Fitschen, noting that they had not received any indications from Brussels or Berlin that there was any need for discussion of any such eventualities.
Apparently they haven't been listening. Discussions have indeed been going on for some time, in Berlin and, most of all, Brussels.
The European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services, Michel Barnier, a former French cabinet minister with snow-white hair, is the most feared of the Brussels commissioners in European financial centers. He is already responsible for more than 30 EU regulations decreeing how banks and other financial market players are to do business in the future.
Nevertheless, Barnier has shied away from a structural reform that would affect Europe's major lenders. He is part of the power elite in Paris, which has close ties to large French banks like BNP Paribas and Société Générale. Only after extensive plans for the restructuring of major banks were discussed in the United States and Britain did he ask Erkki Liikanen, the governor of Finland's central bank, to assemble a commission to investigate structural reforms that could lead to the splitting up of major banks.
Liikanen has put together a group consisting of economists, bankers and industry representatives. Ironically, there is one member of the group with whom Jain has a less affectionate relationship than he does with Fitschen: Deutsche's former Chief Risk Officer Hugo Bänziger, who would have liked to become CEO himself and who could now become a problem for his erstwhile rivals.
The 11 experts have been instructed to pay particular attention to reforms in the United States and Britain. In the United States, the so-called Volcker rule largely prohibits banks from engaging in risky trading activity for their own accounts. The Vickers Commission in London has put forward proposals aimed at separating capital market transactions from banking activities that are vital to the functioning of the economy and the financial system, namely the lending and deposit business.
Growing Support for Radical Bank Reform
In Europe, breaking up the banks was long seen as more of a subject for armchair economists than a real prospect. But in recent weeks, even corporate leaders like Nikolaus von Bomhard, head of the insurance giant Munich Re, and Klaus Engel, CEO of chemical manufacturer Evonik Industries, have conceded that they would like to see a separation between high-risk investment banking and other bank operations.
Despite numerous reforms in the financial sector, there is one problem regulators have yet to solve: Many banks are so big that no country can afford to allow them to fail. This is why the government bailed out a number of financial companies starting in 2008, a move that allowed major banks like Deutsche Bank to grow even larger.
"Taking a more-of-the-same approach in the treatment of major banks is not an option", warns Daniel Zimmer, head of the German Monopolies Commission. "First of all, in contrast to 2008, many countries no longer have the resources to bail out banks. Second, taxpayers are no longer willing to foot the bill for the financial industry's mistakes."
But what can be done? Zimmer notes that Germany has already taken steps in the right direction. Under the new German restructuring law, when a bank is in trouble the most critical parts of the institution can be transferred to a bridge bank, allowing the remainder to be liquidated. In such cases, the shareholders and most of the bank's creditors would not be compensated. A fund made up of contributions from banks would cover restructuring costs.
But there is a problem with the new system. "In a worst-case scenario, a bank has to be split up into vital and other parts within a single weekend," says Zimmer. "This is only possible if there is already a clear separation between the two parts beforehand." This is why Zimmer believes it makes sense to establish the dividing line in advance, in a manner similar to what Britain's Vickers Commission envisions.
Bank executives point out that it was precisely specialized banks like Lehman Brothers and Hypo Real Estate that failed in 2008 and threatened the financial system, whereas universal banks are more stable.
Banks Could Submit Liquidation Plans in Case of Crises
This reflects the official position taken by Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank. But Andreas Dombret, the board member responsible for financial market stability, who worked for investment banks for many years, disagrees. "I support a system of universal banks, as long as we can find a solution to the too-big-to-fail problem."
Dombret doesn't want to achieve this through a mandatory spinoff of the banks' investment banking arms. Instead, he believes that banks and regulators should agree on coordinated restructuring and liquidation plans that, in the event of a crisis, facilitate splitting off the investment banking business and safeguarding the critical parts of a bank. "Only if this doesn't work should we consider a solution that involves splitting up the banks." This, says Dombret, could mean that various parts of a bank are made legally independent while remaining bundled together within a holding company.
In the United States, global financial companies are already required to submit to regulators the kinds of liquidation plans Dombret describes. A law proposed by the European Commission this summer would also require European banks to submit such plans.
The 29-page executive summary of the liquidation plan Deutsche Bank submitted to US regulators reveals how complex this can be. Under the plan, some 1,113 subsidiaries and 1,504 special-purpose entities would have to be disentangled in the event of a crisis.
Experts question whether the massive plans would work in an actual crisis. "As long as the investment banking and private customer businesses are tightly interwoven, the two parts can't be liquidated separately," says a member of Liikanen commission. For this reason, he adds, the investment bank's financing cycle would have to be separated from the remainder of the business.
Drastic Consequences
Dirk Bliesener, a partner in the law firm of Hengeler Mueller, goes even further. "If you want a structural delimitation of certain parts of investment banking, it isn't enough to merely disconnect refinancing from the rest of the bank. The two parts would also have to be separated legally." But whether this truly suffices to prevent an imbalance is heavily dependent on individual circumstances, Bliesener adds.
The most important thing is to isolate the trading business, in which banks engage in high-risk activities. But Christoph Kaserer, a banking expert at the Technical University of Munich, also advocates separating payment transactions from the lending business, so as to ensure that when a credit bank runs into trouble, millions of companies and households can continue to process payments. Financial companies could continue to service customers with loans and capital market transactions if all areas were bundled under the umbrella of a holding company, says Kaserer.
The consequences of banks having to corral their investment banking operations would be drastic. With the elimination of the implicit government guarantee and cross-subsidization through deposit customers, funding this business could become too costly to be worthwhile for some providers.
The result would be a long overdue market adjustment. "A separated banking system would be good for competition," says monopoly expert Zimmer.
Compromise Taking Shape
The banks are resisting the plans being hatched by the Liikanen group, and they have powerful advocates. In a Sept. 6 letter to Barnier, major French corporations GDF Suez and Lafarge strongly oppose the revolution in the European banking industry. They write that companies need large, efficient financial groups with international networks that are at home in all global markets. "These goals are more likely to be met if the model of a diversified, 'universal' bank is retained," reads the letter, which was also sent to Liikanen.
Senior European Commission officials are already signaling that Liikanen will not propose a radical solution such as a breakup of large banks. "A compromise is taking shape that amounts to the isolation of investment banking within the companies," say sources in Brussels.
At last Saturday's meeting of European Union finance ministers in Cyprus, Liikanen, together with Barnier, described the current status of discussions within his group. But according to one member of the commission, the group has not reached a consensus yet and is still deliberating.
Meanwhile, Jain and Fitschen continue to march steadfastly in the opposite direction. Last week, they announced their intention to further strengthen consolidation among all segments of the bank.
Australia is the only country in the world that requires transgender teenagers to apply to a Family Court before they can start taking cross-sex hormones.
In NSW, many of the families seeking this treatment access pro bono legal help through the Inner City Legal Centre (ICLC). Currently, the centre has 19 cases open.
However, faced with a funding cut and a growing client list, the centre has started a crowdfunding campaign so it can continue to take on new cases.
Solicitor Hilary Kincaid, who has represented several parents of transgender children through the ICLC, told BuzzFeed News there has been a "marked increase in demand" in 2016.
“At the moment, we don't turn anyone away," she said. "I open a new file for anyone who asks. But that can't last."
Centre director Vicki Harding said the need for legal help has grown with increasing awareness and acceptance of transgender children.
"When there was quite a bit of interest in the mainstream media recently, we started getting three to four calls from families each week," she said.
"We tell them what they need to do. They need to organise specialist reports, get affidavits. We work with them on all that detail of the application.
"The amazing thing for families is that we do this free of charge, and if they opted for a private solicitor, they would pay thousands to go through this process."
Kincaid estimates the cost of going through the application with a private solicitor is around $15,000.
10 years ago I used the phrase New Patronage Economy to describe how open source and cloud were changing the relationship between people, the work they do, and how that work is valued and paid for. At the time I was hopeful that open source would somewhat change the contract to favour the creators of the work.
“Big companies need to find ways to sponsor the grassroots; supporting open source, for example, is a great way to do it.”
“In this view of the world, open source, Creative Commons and Open Data, are even more important, because it may be that the only way the talent is willing to hand over its intellectual property is in the form of shared community assets. If code is open source I can work on it regardless of who I work for at any given time. Otherwise if I leave I have to leave my baby behind. The talent potentially has a lot more control. In the music world this might translate into a refusal to allow record companies to DRM-hobble works. And if companies want to buy the talent's IP outright they may find that rates start to go up considerably.”
The sponsorship model has ticked along in the background, but as open source has exploded, further questions have emerged about how to sustain and maintain the maintainers. The Long Tail of open source projects is very poorly supported from a financial perspective.
Nadia Egbhal brought this tension to the fore with a great report, sponsored by The Ford Foundation, Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure.
“Our modern society runs on software. But the tools we use to build software are buckling under increased demand.
Nearly all software today relies on free, public code, written and maintained by communities of developers and other talent. This code can be used by anyone—from companies to individuals—to write their own software. Shared, public code makes up the digital infrastructure of our society today.
Everybody relies on shared code to write software, including Fortune 500 companies, government, major software companies and startups. In a world driven by technology, we are putting increased demand on those who maintain our digital infrastructure. Yet because these communities are not highly visible, the rest of the world has been slow to notice.
Just like physical infrastructure, digital infrastructure needs regular upkeep and maintenance. But financial support for digital infrastructure is much harder to come by.”
So how to support this infrastructure? Patreon is a membership platform designed to enable artists and creators to establish a sustainable income, a better packaged version of the digital tip jar. “Bringing patronage back to the arts“. In an age where the media is under severe pressure, independent voices have turned to Patreon to supplement their income and allow them to act as fourth estate.
For some of the best and most high profile software developers Patreon is doing the job. It works for folks like Eran Hammer.

Another platform organisation seeking to maintain the maintainers is OpenCollective, which supports open source projects. It's being used a fair bit in the world of Javascript frameworks – such as GulpJS, Next.js, angular-fullstack, react-boilerplate.
MochaJS now has 56 backers and an annual budget of just around $24.5k.
Webpack though is the big kahuna – with 438 backers worth $104k per year.
That's pretty awesome. The OpenCollective platform is nicely granular. If you look at the Collective's SustainOSS event, for example, you can see individual line items on the budget such as childcare, travel for the photographer or the pre-conference dinner.
To the point above about the long tail of open source projects however, with both Patreon and OpenCollective some of the projects have no backers at all. Please go and fund something you use now!
We should also be wary of seeing direct support models as a panacea. Some companies are not contributing as much as they should to the people and communities building software they use, and in some cases make money from. You can make money with open source, but it's extremely hard to make money from open source. That's the reality. It reminds me a bit of the crazy notion gofundme is a reasonable alternative for affordable comprehensive healthcare.
Let's do better.

Along the delightful path from sugar to ethanol, yeast creates many intermediate compounds, some of which go on to metabolize into various other compounds, while others are utilized by the yeast to complete fermentation or store energy for survival once the current sugar source is depleted. A portion of these intermediate compounds are inevitably left behind despite our unicellular friends' best efforts, and to a degree, they help make up the profile of a beer. Whether or not these residual compounds are considered complimentary or an off-flavor often comes down to what the brewer prefers for their final product. Unlike diacetyl, which is acceptable and even preferred to some degree in certain beer styles, perceptible levels of acetaldehyde (C 2 H 4 O or CH 3 CHO) is viewed by most as undesirable on a fairly universal scale.
Acetaldehyde (ass-eh-tal-deh-hyde) is an organic compound in the aldehyde family that's common in trace amounts not only in beer, but also coffee, certain ripe fruits, and wine. Throughout my journey in beer, I've found people tend to experience acetaldehyde differently with most saying it has a pungent green apple character akin to green Jolly Ranchers, though it also yields descriptive terms including latex paint, raw pumpkin, and bug spray or citronella. To me, acetaldehyde is very off putting, at least when I've tasted beer I thought I perceived it in, but who's to say I wasn't picking up something else?
Curious about the ability of tasters to detect and identify acetaldehyde, we designed this xBmt in collaboration with makers of high quality off-flavor capsules, FlavorActiV, in order to evaluate it for ourselves.
| PURPOSE |
To evaluate the ability of blind tasters to distinguish between a pale lager dosed with acetaldehyde from an unadulterated sample of the same beer.
| METHODS |
I received various FlavorActiV flavor standards in the mail from Marshall, all of which had the labels removed and had a name written on the package for identification. The primary reason for doing this was to keep me blind to the off-flavor for my own trials.
In keeping with prior xBmts in this off-flavor series, I opted to use Bitburger German Pilsner due to its clean ester profile, firm maltiness, and moderate bitterness that I figured would allow the adulterant to shine. I considered using a prototypical American Light Lager but was dissuaded by a distinctive apple or pear-like sweetness some perceive in them, I didn't want that getting in the way of the off-flavor.
The accepted flavor threshold for acetaldehyde is 5-15 parts per million (ppm) with most commercial beers clocking in at levels around 2-4 ppm, present but not detectable. Unable to find any data on acetaldehyde levels in Bitburger, I was forced to trust it was close to absent based both on my perception and the fact it's generally lauded as a clean German Pils.
Each acetaldehyde capsule provided by FlavorActiV is designed to impart 3 times the flavor threshold when added to 1 liter of beer, a concentration we determined would be ideal for testing such a commonly cited off-flavor. To prepare the dosed sample, I followed the instructions provided by FlavorActiv by first gently pouring about 200 mL of beer into a standard 4 liter pitchers, adding the contents of 2 flavor standard capsules, gently swirling, then adding an additional 1800 mL of beer to the vessel. The non-dosed samples were treated similarly to ensure no differences caused by anything other than the off-flavor.
| RESULTS |
Data for this xBmt was collected during a TRASH Homebrewers meeting being held at Apis Mead & Winery. In total, 22 people with varying levels of experience, all blind to the variable, were served 1 sample of the beer intentionally dosed with acetaldehyde flavor standard and 2 samples of the clean beer in different colored opaque cups then instructed to select the unique sample. In order to reach statistical significance, 12 tasters (p<0.05) would have had to select the dosed sample, though 15 (p=0.0009) accurately identified the unique sample, suggesting participants were able to reliably distinguish a beer intentionally dosed with acetaldehyde from a clean sample of the same beer.
Those participants who correctly selected the acetaldehyde beer as being different were instructed to complete a brief set of additional questions comparing only the two different beers, still blind to the nature of the xBmt.
When the 15 tasters who correctly identified the unique sample on the triangle test were asked about preference, 11 chose the non-dosed sample and 4 reported having no preference despite noticing a difference. Not a single taster endorsed the beer dosed with acetaldehyde as the one they preferred.
It was then revealed to participants that one of the samples had been dosed with an off-flavor, though they were not informed which off-flavor was used. When asked to identify the beer they believed was dosed with an off-flavor, all 15 tasters made the correct selection. Next, tasters were provided a list of common off-flavors that included brief descriptions of how they typically present in beer and asked to select the one they believed the beer was dosed with. Acetaldehyde received a plurality of the votes with 6 tasters correctly selecting it while 3 believed it was DMS, 2 chose astringent, 2 thought it was metallic, 1 selected butyric, and 1 felt the beer was dosed with oxidized flavor standard.
My Impressions: Since I was unaware of the particular off-flavor being used for this xBmt, my trials were more blind than usual. While not as obvious as I imagined given the concentration in the beer, I was able to consistently identify the unique sample over four triangle tests. To me, the dosed beer had a different mouthfeel than the clean samples, which is what led me to initially believe astringency was the off-flavor used in this xBmt. However, returning to the beers a bit later, still unaware of what the off-flavor was, I detected an aroma akin to bug spray that made me second guess myself, as this was something I knew to be associated with acetaldehyde.
| DISCUSSION |
With descriptors like green apple, latex, and bug spray combined with a relatively low flavor threshold, it's not surprising participants were able to reliably distinguish a beer intentionally dosed with acetaldehyde to 3 times the threshold from non-dosed samples. Combined with the fact 6 of the 15 tasters who were correct on the triangle test accurately identified the off-flavor, these results support the notion that, at least in higher concentrations, acetaldehyde is both detectable and identifiable.
As a Nationally ranked BJCP judge who values the evaluative side of brewing and beer, I was pleased with these results and felt validated to some degree. That said, knowing that the adulterated sample was dosed to 3 times the flavor threshold left me wondering what the actual concentration is in the beers homebrewers make that get dinged for having acetaldehyde. Since judging is done by fallible human beings, I've little doubt acetaldehyde is occasionally mistaken for other flavors, though it seems it may not be as good at hiding itself in beer as other commonly cited off-flavors.

(CNN) Another police shooting has been captured on video and posted on social media.
This one occurred Saturday morning when a Miami Beach, Florida, officer killed a man during a confrontation on a busy street. A passerby shot the video and posted it to Instagram
On Sunday, police identified the man as David W. Winesett, 52. A police press release said he had been serving a 151-month federal prison sentence for bank robberies and had escaped from a Miami halfway house for prisoners.
Police started looking for the man after a report of a bank robbery, police Chief Daniel Oates said Saturday at a press briefing . The suspect was spotted a block from the bank, went into a barbershop and came out with a straight-edge razor, the chief said. The man raised his hand with the razor during a confrontation with police and was shot twice by an officer with a rifle, Oates said.
The video shows a shirtless man confronted by several police officers.
The man takes a couple steps forward, places his left hand on the front of a parked police cruiser and stops. His right hand can no longer be seen -- it is blocked from view by an officer to his side.
Moments later, the officer fires the rifle -- two shots can be heard -- and the man falls backward onto the street, clutching his chest. A scream can be heard.
'It's tragic for everybody involved'
The man who was shot was Hispanic, police said. The officer, a six-year veteran, is Hispanic. The officer's identity has not been released.
Miami-Dade police, not Miami Beach police, will investigate the shooting, Oates said. The FBI and Miami Beach police will investigate the attempted bank robbery.
"It's a horrible, an isolated incident and it's tragic for everybody involved," Mayor Philip Levine said.
The FBI said a man entered a Bank of America branch about 10:26 a.m. and handed an employee a note saying he had a bomb and demanded money. After threatening to shoot a customer, the man left without money and didn't leave an explosive device behind, the FBI said.
Officers spotted the man about a block away, in the 1500 block of Alton Street.
The man went into the barbershop and at first refused officers' orders to come out, Oates said. When he did emerge he had removed his shirt and was armed with the razor, the chief said.
Chief says man had razor in his hand
"He was challenged by the officers in the street and at some point during that confrontation he did raise his hand with a straight-edge razor in it and he was shot," Oates said.
Oates said Miami Beach had recently instituted a body camera program and one of the officers was wearing a camera. However, state law prohibits releasing the bodycam video to the media at this point, he said.
Marcellus Johnson, who shot the video posted on Instagram, told CNN he was walking to get coffee when he noticed a crowd of people with their camera phones up.
"I looked to my left and there was a guy inside of the barbershop ... and he was banging on the window with a sharp object, maybe a knife or so," Johnson said. "The police were trying to get him to come outside of the establishment. He eventually came out."
Videographer: Police tried to calm man
Johnson said police got the employees out of the shop and tried to calm the man.
"He came outside and was basically yelling gestures out to the police officers," he said. "The officers were giving him directions, 'Please put down the weapon. Calm down, we are on your side, we are trying to help you.' That lasted about five minutes and after about five minutes of that they decided to shoot him."
Johnson said the man was waving the razor as he talked.
"He's gesturing but he is yelling at the same time so it is almost like he might throw this at me or he might come at me with the razor," he said. "When he started moving forward towards them and they start backing up a little bit and he puts his hand on the actual police car."
Johnson said he thinks officers used a stun gun on the suspect. Police have not said whether the officers used such a device.
In other cases, police officers were prosecuted when fatal shootings were caught on video.
In Chicago, an officer was charged with murder in the 2014 killing of Laquan McDonald . The dashcam video was not publicly released for more than a year causing public anger. The city's police superintendent stepped down and some people urged Mayor Rahm Emanuel to resign, too.
Taken on its face, the high end of the Calgary Flames roster is probably among the best in the Western Conference.

You have Johnny Gaudreau, Mark Giordano, Dougie Hamilton, TJ Brodie, the entire 3M line, Sean Monahan. The good news is that basically all those guys, with the exception of Giordano (very old) and Matthew Tkachuk (very young), are in their mid- to late-20s.
This is what you'd call a team's “window to win” — the point at which most of a team's big-ticket players are around the primes of their careers — but the Flames have a very serious problem. You can have a good group at the top of your lineup, but if you don't support them at the lower end, your ability to actually win while your window is open is limited.
Over the past few years, the Flames have done little to support that core group, making bad bets on outside or simply having good bets not pay off, not really developing prospects at any kind of reasonable rate, not spending to the ceiling, and (perhaps most importantly) getting it very, very wrong in net.

We're now past the point where this could be called a rebuilding team. You're no longer rebuilding when you fire the old coach, trade picks away for more immediate help, make the playoffs, and so on.
Last year the Flames should have gotten good goaltending. Brian Elliott and Chad Johnson are two guys with very solid track records. They combined to go .910 over the course of the season, in a league in which the average netminder stopped shots at .915. They made the playoffs anyway, though just barely, and got swept out of the first round.
Story continues
So the team recognized goaltending as a major flaw; it probably cost them 10 or 11 goals over the course of the season, which is the equivalent of about three points in the standings. They gain three points and maybe they avoid the Ducks in the first round, depending upon where they lost them and so on. So in response to this major flaw, their big offseason plan was to go out and get… Mike Smith and Eddie Lack?
Smith has been roughly league-average the past two seasons, but the one before that he was horrific (.904). He also didn't carry a particularly heavy workload over that time, averaging fewer than 50 appearances per season. Moreover, he's 35. So the Flames are gambling that a 35-year-old goalie whose career numbers are hardly inspiring will do better than Elliott, which doesn't seem likely based on the track records of the two goalies in question.
In addition, backup Eddie Lack has a whopping .902 save percentage over the past two seasons, so the idea that he will somehow return to the .917 he posted as a “1b” goalie over two seasons in Vancouver is likewise farfetched.
Lack's on a one-year deal. Calgary has some interesting goaltending prospects it could turn to after that — most likely Jon Gillies, though he wasn't great in the AHL last season (.910). But Smith is signed for each of the next two seasons, at which point that makes three of the prime years for the Flames core — or the waning days of Giordano's usefulness — potentially wasted on subaverage goaltending.
The likelihood that a Smith-led platoon of any kind over the next 164 regular-season games continues to not-deliver seems fairly high, but again, he and whatever backups they use don't have to be all that good to match what Calgary's guys managed to not-deliver last year.
The other problem the Flames have is the goaltending wasn't exactly supported by the soundest 5-on-5 process in the league. Calgary finished 15th in adjusted Corsi last season, though to be fair part of that was because the team was a mess in its first few weeks under Glen Gulutzan — on whom no one should really be completely sold at this point — before righting the ship to some extent. After Dec. 1, the Flames' CF% was 10th in the league, which is certainly where you want to be headed.
To that extent, you have to be accepting and say that the first few months were so bad, not only for the skaters but between the pipes as well, that you can probably spot the Flames more than the seven regulation wins they earned in the first two months of the season this time around. Perfectly reasonable, even if you have a very dour outlook about Smith and Lack.
But that's what gets into the concerns about the Flames' depth and lack of developed young players. After the five forwards listed above, and maybe you lump in Kris Versteeg and even Micheal Ferland if you want to be charitable, the Flames have a lot of problems up front this season. They might try to make Troy Brouwer “a thing” on the top line again, but that was a disaster last time out. Matt Stajan is their No. 3 center. Sam Bennett hasn't come along much at all. They'll be counting on a rookie or two to chips in offensively.
Only six forwards finished with CF% of more than 50 percent last season, and one of them (Alex Chiasson) doesn't seem like he's coming back. Even free of context, this is a concern, but the five they have coming back are the five “core” guys listed above. That's got to be seen as a big issue.
After all, what can you expect out of Stajan, offensively? How many goals do Freddie Hamilton and Curtis Lazar give you if they're everyday players? Can Sam Bennett find some way to clear 30 points again, let alone 40? And they certainly didn't add any offense this summer, instead making their big move to trade for Travis Hamonic, who could excel in a middle-pairing role. But that's not really what they needed here.
That's where the lack of prospect development comes in. Bennett — who, again, has been a major disappointment as a fourth-overall pick — and Monahan are the only Flames first-rounders pre-Tkachuk to become NHL regulars in the past several years. And that's despite the fact that they had five first-round picks from 2012 to 2014. The other three have a combined 10 NHL games played between them, and just one assist (I looked it up: it was a secondary).
The good news is the Flames don't need defense. Their top-four is among the best in the league, and the bottom pair after that is perfectly alright. But they need goals, having finished tied for 15th last season, and they need someone to stop the puck.
Whether they have either, despite more than $7.1 million in cap space, remains to be seen. Bennett is still without a contract, and the Flames have that kind of money laying around despite paying buyout penalties for not one, not two, but three different players right now.
It's tough to see where this team legitimately stacks up against the rest of that division, let alone the conference, despite all the high-end talent. (And that's with the acknowledgement that even after all the goals he scores, we still don't have a ton of evidence Monahan moves the needle in possession).
The fact that this is even a question given the circumstances surrounding the team's core should give everyone pause.
What, exactly, do they hope to accomplish with this group?
Point is, two or three years from now, they might all look around and realize, “Oh, we could have cobbled something together here.” Instead, there seems to be a strange lack of ambition here, which is weird given the team's previous ‘Going For It' culture.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- A familiar face helped the Detroit Tigers to a familiar fate.
Brandon Inge hit a three-run home run to help the Oakland A's pull away Friday night as the Detroit Tigers continued a trend of alternating wins and losses with an 11-4 loss to the A's.
It's been one step forward, one step back for the Tigers since April 27, when they saw a losing streak stretch to five games following a 7-6 loss to the New York Yankees. The Tigers claimed a 7-5 victory the next day and have alternated wins and losses ever since.
The Tigers have not won consecutive games since April 18, when they on their fourth consecutive game and completed a three-game sweep of the Kansas City Royals. They have played 20 games since then.
Tigers starter Rick Porcello left the game after five innings Friday night with the Tigers trailing 4-2, but the A's broke it open against relief pitcher Duane Below, who had not allowed a run in 14 innings pitched this season coming into the game. Josh Reddick singled home a run with one out to make it 5-2, and Inge hit his three-run home run to left field with two outs to make it 8-2.
That gave Inge four RBIs in the game and eight so far in the series. Inge
in the first game of the four-game series, a
.
According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Inge is the first player to have four games of at least four RBIs in a five-game span since Lou Gehrig in 1931.
The Tigers scored a run in the top of the first to take an early lead. Austin Jackson led off the game with a double, went to third on a single by Andy Dirks and scored on a double-play grounder off the bat of Miguel Cabrera.
The's bounced right back with two runs in the bottom of the inning off Porcello. Porcello retired the first two batters he faced, but the next four reached base. Inge singled in a run for the A's during that rally.
The Tigers tied the game in the top of the third. Gerald Laird reached base on an error by Inge, moved to second on a single by Danny Worth, advanced to third on a fly ball to right field by Jackson and scored on a two-out single by Cabrera. That made it 2-2.
But the A's bounced back in the bottom of the inning with two runs to retake the lead. Reddick led off the inning with a home run to right field, and Kila Ka'aihue and Seth Smith followed with back-to-back doubles to make it 4-2.
Reddick hit a three-run home run in the seventh inning off Collin Balester, who gave up the grand slam to Inge the night before, to make it 11-2. It was the first multi-home run game of his career, and he finished the game 4-for-4 with a walk, five RBIs and four runs scored.
The Tiger rallied for a pair of runs in the eighth. Cabrera and Delmon Young had RBI singles in the inning.
Porcello allowed four runs on nine hits and three walks in five innings of work. He struck out four.
MUMBAI: Taking stern actions against the Sahara in the high-profile investor refund case involving over Rs 24,000 crore, market regulator Sebi on Wednesday ordered freezing of bank accounts and attachment of all properties of two group firms and top executives, including Subrata Roy
Sebi's action follows directions from the Supreme Court , which had said last week that the market regulator was free to freeze accounts and attach properties if Sahara group companies were not depositing the money with it for refund to investors. Passing two separate orders against Sahara Housing Investment Corporation Ltd (SHICL) and Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Ltd (SIRECL), Sebi said that the two companies had raised Rs 6,380 crore and Rs 19,400 crore respectively from bondholders and "various illegalities" were committed in raising of these funds.The Supreme Court in August last year had asked Sahara group firms to refund the money with 15 per cent interest and had asked Sebi to facilitate the refund. However, the group in December, 2012 was allowed to pay the money in three instalments, including an immediate payment of Rs 5,120 crore, followed by an installment of Rs 10,000 crore in the first week of January and remainder by the first week of February 2012.In its orders passed on Wednesday, Sebi said that neither of the two instalments was paid and therefore it is constrained to take necessary action as per the Supreme Court orders. With regard to the payment of Rs 5,120 crore also, Saharas have claimed that only Rs 2,620 crore remained to be refunded to investors and it has already paid Rs 19,400 crore to the bondholders.The properties being attached by Sebi include the land owned by the Sahara group company Aamby Valley Ltd, which has set up a resort village near Pune, development rights of land at prime locations in Delhi, Gurgaon, Mumbai and various other places across the country.Besides, Sebi has also ordered attachment of equity shares held in Aamby Valley Ltd, units of mutual funds, bank and demat accounts and investments in all the branches of all banks. Sebi has asked all the banks to transfer the amounts lying in those accounts to its Sebi-Sahara Refund Account.With regard to Subrata Roy and three other directors, namely Vandana Bhargava, Ravi Shanker Dubey and Ashok Roy Choudhary, Sebi ordered freezing of all bank and demat accounts of these four persons, as also attachment of all moveable and immoveable properties in their name with immediate effect.Sebi directed them to furnish details of all moveable and immoveable properties in their name within 21 days, pending which they can not alienate, dispose or encumber any of their assets.The regulator said it is seeking attachment of all other movable and immoveable properties owned and/or held by the two companies SIRECL with immediate effect and asked them not to "alienate, dispose or in any manner encumber the same".Sebi also directed the two firms to furnish details of any other investments within 21 days and restrained them with immediate effect from operating their bank and demat accounts and from withdrawing of any investments.The two companies have also been asked to deposit cash, bank balances and fixed deposits in their names to Sebi and have also been barred from transferring any shares held by them.Sebi said it has informed RBI and Enforcement Directorate as well regarding its actions against the Sahara group firms.The assets being attached include investments of SIRECL and SHICL in group companies, special purpose vehicles and partnership firms and the necessary orders for sale of all attached properties would be passed in due course after getting their full particulars, Sebi said.
THE high cost of living in Sydney was a key factor in Andrejs Everitt's decision to return to Melbourne and play for Carlton.
The 24 year old became the fourth Swan to depart in the wake of Lance Franklin's arrival at the SCG joining Shane Mumford, Jesse White and Jed Lamb on the departures list.
AFL TRADE MONTH REPORT CARDS
The 9 per cent cost of living allowance paid to the Swans and the Giants has been the subject of controversy following the signing of Franklin and Kurt Tippett in consecutive seasons.
Melbourne clubs led by Collingwood President Eddie McGuire have called for the scrapping of the arrangement.
“The expense of Sydney compared to Melbourne was one of the key factors in Andrejs decision making process,” Everitt's manager Winston Rous from Phoenix Management told News Limited.
“Rental costs are much higher in Sydney as are the most living expenses.
“For players outside the top 25 per cent of salaries there are quality of life issues that you weigh up when looking at offers from other clubs.”
Everitt had his best season playing 15 matches including three finals but because of the Franklin signing weren't able to put an offer in front of Everitt until the second last day of the trade period.
Jed Lamb's decision to go to the Giants created some salary cap space for the versatile utility.
“While we're disappointed to lose Andrejs, we understand his reason for seeking a trade to Carlton and we wish him all the best in the future at his new club,” Moore said.
The Swans also traded pick 39 in next month's National draft for pick 32 as part of the deal.
Carlton will become Everitt's third AFL club after starting his career at the Western Bulldogs in 2007 selected at pick 11 in the draft, he has now played 79 games.
“We're rapt actually to secure the services of Andrejs,” Carlton Football Manager Andrew McKay said.
“He was keen to come back down to Melbourne and we were very, very keen to get his services.”
The staff of “Running Man” took a moment during the show's most recent episode to apologize to the cast members.
The December 25 episode of SBS's “Running Man” was a Christmas special that featured a guest appearance from Kim So Hyun.
At the end of the episode, all six cast members could be seen coming together. The scene was filmed after the recent controversy, and Kim Jong Kook broke the ice by saying, “I thought I wasn't going to see your faces again, but here we are.”
Yoo Jae Suk then opened the big box in front of them. Inside the box was a bouquet of flowers and apples, along with a letter that read, “To our loving “Running Man” cast members. We apologize for the hurt and pain we have caused you. We will do our best to be a more mature and hardworking staff from now on.”
As the leader of the group, Yoo Jae Suk replied to the staff's apology by stating, “We will work harder than ever in the new year. We would like to take this moment to apologize to our viewers once more for causing them distress.” The other members then joined him in wishing everyone a “Merry Christmas!”
With “Running Man” set to end next February, we hope everything goes smoothly for the cast from now till then!

We all know Bucky is the baddest Mascot in the Big 10. From the year 1940, Bucky, the “W” adorned badger, has grown into an iconic mascot with a voracious appetite for leading stadium-shaking chants and fortuitous campus appearances. But did you know Bucky is one of the few college mascots in the Mascot Hall of Fame? Or that, “Bucky” is just a nickname – and the full name is actually Buckingham U. Badger?
So how do we think Bucky got into the Mascot Hall of Fame, think he submitted a resume? Of course not! But… if he did… what would it look like?
Univeristy of Wisconsin – Madison's Bucky Badger's Resume
When you think of Bucky Badger the first thing that comes to mind is Camp Randall and football games. Yet, just like you, an undergraduate student, there's always more than what meets the eye.
We though making a resume for good old Bucky would be an awesome way to inform students on how to make an awesome resume, so we created his first Rezi resume that shows Bucky is more than just a icon, but also a hall-of-fame inducted, trendsetting film-star, with a knack for being at activities around campus.
First, Brainstorm Your Involvement
You'll need to think of what you've been up to as a student, well just the things you would want an employer to know. For starters, organize your experience into the following categories:
Professional Experience – Did you have any cool internships? This is the place to list the positions where you were paid to do something.
Projects – Did you work on any cool projects? It is okay if they are self-directed, it is also okay if they are part of a class! Just make sure to clearly describe your accomplishment!
Education – Major? Graduation date? Honors? Awards? School name?
Coursework – This is a cool way to show employers that your classes are teaching you value skills which can be applied in the workplace. Read this guide to find out how to do a really good job at using university coursework as a value adding substitute to professional experience
Campus Involvement – Whether it is volunteering, clubs, organizations, don't forget to add it as it shows employers that you're a pretty awesome person!
Next, Translate the Information for the Resume
It is difficult to explain accomplishments and equally difficult to recognize your own accomplishments. Keep this in mind: each bullet point should be complete. You can rely on answering what, why, and how, to create a well-thought out bullet point. Let's take an example which explains how to demonstrate email experience in a marketing role.
This is an example of a lazy descriptor:
• Sent out weekly emails to lead lists
In this point, which was pulled from a real resume, we learn that the applicant used email marketing. Awesome. However, that's literally all we can gather from the bullet point.
This is a much better descriptor:
• Managed Google Analytics data tracking campaigns to maximize the effectiveness of email remarketing initiatives that were deployed using Salesforce's marketing cloud software. Used Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL/SQL) to search data for customer-specific information
Back to Bucky! Did you know all of these facts about him?
The as-yet unnamed Wisconsin mascot appeared as a human-like cartoon figure in University of Wisconsin publications in the 1930s.
The most familiar portrayal of Bucky Badger, wearing a “W” sweater and strutting forward with a fierce expression, was drawn by California-based commercial artist Art Evans in 1940, and first sold from Brown's Book Store in Madison.
An actual badger from Eau Claire was used at the first few football games that year, but proved to be too fierce to be controlled properly and was retired to the nearby Henry Vilas Zoo.
In 2006, Bucky was inducted as a charter member of the Mascot Hall of Fame's College Division, joining YoUDee from Delaware, Sparty from the Michigan State University, and Aubie from Auburn.
Academic departments and groups at UW-Madison have a rich history of modifying Bucky. Recent university guidelines, however, have banned the modification of Bucky Badger,
Blind Bucky is sometimes used to represent the University of Wisconsin Law School as a variation of the allegorical figure of blindfolded Lady Justice
Bucky with a stethoscope is occasionally used by the Medical Alumni Association
Similarly, a design of Bucky wearing a Roman-style toga is used by the university's Classics Society
The Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences department uses a design with Bucky holding a lightning bolt.
Bucky has also been known to don a laboratory coat and carry an Erlenmeyer flask in support of University of Wisconsin-Madison laboratory sciences.
In 2009, Bucky Badger made it to the silver screen in the documentary, Being Bucky. The film, which was created by Chicago ad-men John Fromstein and Scott Smith, both Wisconsin natives, follows the 2007–2008 Buckys: Chris, Blake, Dave, Sky, Ryan, Craig and Jeff. It was released on April 4 at the Wisconsin Film Festival.
Bucky Badger is featured prominently in a parody of the song Teach Me How to Dougie, appropriately titled “Teach me how to Bucky.”, The music video, presented by Zooniversity Music, debuted during the 2010 UW Homecoming Game at Camp Randall vs. Minnesota Golden Gophers

A leading member of the Italian populist Five-Star Movement (M5S) has demanded a referendum Italy's membership of the euro, suggesting it could become a key issue in the next general election.
Alessandro Di Battista, 38, told Germany's Die Welt that he did not want Italy to leave the EU but he did back a referendum on the euro.
“The euro and Europe are not the same thing. We only want for Italians to decide on the currency,” Battista told the newspaper.
Analysts warn that leaving the euro would endanger the Italian and global markets.
Battista said that he “understood well the consequences of the introduction of the euro”. The single currency, he said, had decreased Italian purchasing power and earnings and sparked unemployment and “social deprivation”.
“If Europe does not want to implode you must accept that you cannot go on like this,” the potential party leader said.
Last week the prime minister, Matteo Renzi, announced.
An early election is expected next year with Renzi mentioning February as a possibility.
M5S, which is led by the comedian Beppe Grillo, is Italy's second most popular party, behind Renzi's left-of-centre Democratic Party. It won two significant mayoral elections in Turin and Rome this summer.
M5S's chances of winning the next election are good, according to pollsters but to hold a referendum would depend on securing majorities in both parliamentary houses.
That may depend on the contentious electoral law that is under legal review and will dictate how parliamentary seats will be allocated at the next election. The constitutional court is set to rule on the electoral law on January 24.
Unless parliamentarians fashion a fresh electoral law for the upper house, Italy risks going to the polls with one set a rule for electing the lower Chamber of Deputies and another for the Senate. Many political leaders predict that would invite electoral deadlock.
The defeated constitutional reforms would have made the Senate no longer elected by voters.
“This is pure M5S. Being for ‘direct democracy' … they don't take a position and call for a referendum. This allows them to be both black and white. In our present political condition, this is pure genius,” said Giovanni Orsina, a political scientist at LUISS University in Rome.
Federico Santi of the Eurasia Group said the membership of the euro could become a key battleground.
“What we have seen lately is a constant focus on the EU and how it limits what Italy can do to handle the banking crisis, which is portrayed as having a negative impact on households,” Santi explained.
Cloak and Dagger is once again in the works as a TV series, with Marvel Studios and ABC Signature developing the project for Freeform. (The series had earlier been in development for Freeform's predecessor, ABC Family, back in 2011.) The teen runaways-turned-superheroes are definitely on the obscure side of Marvel's spectrum, having only made sporadic comic book appearances since the cancelation of their last series in 1991. So what, exactly, is so special about these particular characters?
The two characters first appeared in 1982's Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man No. 62, created by Bill Mantlo and Ed Hannigan. As with much of the Mantlo/Hannigan era of Spectacular Spider-Man, Cloak and Dagger's creation owes a lot to Frank Miller's time as Daredevil writer and artist, both in terms of aesthetic and overall tone; just as Miller's Daredevil was a response to urban decay and real-world problems, Cloak and Dagger were intended as the same — albeit with a somewhat defanged, more mainstream appeal.
Cloak and Dagger were originally two teen runaways, Ty Johnson and Randy Bowen, who ended up in New York City for distinctly different reasons: Johnson watched his best friend get killed by police who — wrongly — believed that he'd robbed a grocery store, while Bowen was trying to get the attention of her supermodel mother. After a meet-cute, the two became friends before ending up being used by local crime bosses as guinea pigs for a new heroin substitute that the criminals hoped to flood the market with.
There was only one catch: the new drug not only didn't get them high, it ended up giving them superpowers. Superpowers, it should be noted, that the two them used to launch their own two-person war on drugs. (It was the 1980s.)
In later appearances, this origin would be modified so that it was that the drugs has merely activated powers that the two teens already had, unknowingly. This was done for two reasons; not only did it address the plot hole of "why didn't the crime lords then inject themselves with the same drugs to get their own superpowers?" but it also did away with the notion that taking drugs could give you superpowers — an idiotic implication for a concept that was conceived specifically as containing an anti-drug message.
As luck (or plot contrivance) would have it, the two ended up with superpowers that complemented each other: Cloak (Johnson) possessed the "dark form," which allowed him to access to "the darkness dimension," which he could use to terrify criminals or teleport himself and his allies. Dagger, meanwhile, could make "light daggers," which could paralyze her victims, while also curing drug addiction for reasons that were never quite explained. Additionally, her ability could "feed" Cloak of the light his dark form desired, permanently binding the two together.
For some years, the characters were moderately successful; from 1983 through 1991, they anchored their own series through three volumes (and an additional stint as one of two stories in the Strange Tales anthology) as well as appearing in issues of Spectacular Spider-Man and X-Men spinoff title New Mutants. Since then, their comic book incarnations have only shown up sporadically in service of other storylines and characters, such as in 2008's Dark X-Men or 2011's Spider-Island, both of which saw them working for the bad guys for convoluted reasons.
The characters have shown up on television, during this period, however; animated versions were part of Disney XD's Ultimate Spider-Man in its third season, although even here they were on the wrong side of events twice, helping Taskmaster's Thunderbolts and being possessed by Dormammu in different storylines. (Phil LaMarr and Ashley Eckstein voiced the characters for each appearance on the show.)
It's unknown whether Freeform's live-action show will adopt the anti-drug stance of the original comic book appearances — an element that the comic books themselves had moved away from before the end of the 1980s, favoring more generic superhero adventures — or merely focus on the angst inherent in the co-dependent relationship between the two. But if the television version of Cloak and Dagger makes it to the screen and, further, finds a fan base, it'll have managed to do something that Marvel's comic book arm hasn't managed in more than two decades: finding a hook to make these characters viable with an audience again.
OTTAWA–Trade Minister David Emerson suggested today that the United States has a sweet deal over access to Canada's oil under the North American Free Trade Agreement. He said the two Democratic presidential candidates calling for renegotiations may not know just how good the U.S. has it under the deal.
International Trade Minister David Emerson speaks in the House of Commons in this May 15, 2006, file photo. (Feb. 27, 2008) ( CHRIS WATTIE / REUTERS FILE PHOTO )
Emerson said today that reopening the three-country trade deal would not be a one way street and that Canada also has its list of concessions it would seek if the continental pact was renegotiated. "There's no doubt if NAFTA were to be reopened we would want to have our list of priorities," Emerson said. "Knowledgeable observers would have to take note of the fact that we are the largest supplier of energy to the U.S. and NAFTA has been the foundation for integrating the North American energy market. When people get below the rhetoric and pick away at the details, they are going to find it's not such a slam dunk proposition."

The trade minister's comments came after Democratic presidential rivals Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama said during a debate last night that if they become president, they will pull out of NAFTA unless changes are made to the trade deal. The continental trade agreement, as well as expanded trade with China and other low-wage countries, have come under fire from labour groups in the U.S., who blame free trade for the the loss of hundreds of thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs. In response to a question on whether she'd be willing to withdraw from NAFTA in six months, Clinton called the trade agreement flawed and said her plan includes telling Canada and Mexico that the U.S. will opt out unless the core labour and environmental standards are renegotiated, and the enforcement mechanism is enhanced. Obama also said he would make sure the U.S. renegotiates the deal, and "use the (hammer) of a potential opt-out as leverage" to ensure they get labour and environmental standards that are enforced. Emerson did not say that Canada would insist on putting access to Canadian oil back on the table, but that provision in the deal has been a major concern to Canadian critics who argue that Canada would not be able to claim preferential treatment in a crisis.
Under the trade agreement, Canada is prohibited from cutting off oil exports to the United States if there is a worldwide shortage or supply disruption unless supplies are also rationed to Canadian consumers by the same amount. Earlier today, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said Clinton and Obama may be misinformed about NAFTA.

"NAFTA is of tremendous benefit to Americans, and perhaps the nominees have not had the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the benefit to Americans and the American economy of NAFTA, because there's a tendency to say `it favours Mexico, or it favours Canada,' rather than to recognize the mutual benefits that come out of free trade," he said after a speech in Toronto. Most studies of the nearly 15-year-old continental trade deal conclude all three countries have benefited in increased trade, but Canada and especially Mexico gained an advantage in the balance of trade with the U.S. But Emerson said weighing exports and imports is too simplistic, noting that a car made in Canada and shipped to the U.S. is counted as an export, but includes many parts and inputs from the U.S. "All three partners have gained and have gained substantially," he said. "These people (Clinton and Obama) are seasoned political veterans, and while they are under grassroots pressure at the moment and that probably won't go away, I think sound wise judgement will prevail at the end of the day." He added that the United States' current economic problems stem not from NAFTA, but from the country's own self-made subprime mortgage crisis that has battered the housing sector and from growing competition from Asia, particularly China. Nevertheless, Emerson said he is concerned with the growing stridency of protectionist forces in the U.S., including many in Congress. If NAFTA were to be torn up, Emerson said little would change in the short term but that disputes could increasingly spring up with no neutral way of resolving them. "It's not so much more fights as a less neutral, well-defined way of resolving them," he said. "The dispute resolution mechanism, Chapter 19, has been generally speaking a real benefit for Canadian industry with the possible exception of softwood lumber."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Wednesday took its first step in replacing Obama-era banking regulators, naming a veteran financial lawyer as interim head of the watchdog for federally chartered banks.
Keith Noreika, a partner at law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, will be first deputy comptroller at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and will run the OCC on an interim basis when Comptroller Thomas Curry leaves on May 5, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.
Former banker Joseph Otting, who worked with Mnuchin at Californian lender OneWest, is considered the lead contender to permanently replace Curry, several people familiar with the matter have said. That appointment requires Senate confirmation and analysts said they expected Noreika to be in charge for much of this year.
U.S. President Donald Trump wants to overhaul regulation of the financial services system to make it easier for banks to lend and has asked Mnuchin to review the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law by June 3.
The OCC is one of several regulators that monitors the health of Wall Street banks but has a particularly influential role in scrutinizing lending practices.
Under Curry, OCC bank examiners have clamped down on what they perceive as overly risky loans, particularly the type used to fund private equity buyouts.
Curry used his position to warn banks when he thought they were talking on too much risk in loans to energy firms and property developers.
“Curry did use the bully pulpit to warn banks against risky activity and I think you're likely to see less of that going forward,” said Ian Katz, financial policy analyst at research firm Capital Alpha.
The appointment of Noreika and the expected nomination of Otting meant limits on how many banks can lend to highly indebted companies may be loosened in the future, said Jaret Seiberg, analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group.
“This is the most bullish sign yet for the biggest banks that the Trump administration will pursue a traditional Republican approach of financial regulation rather than adopt a more populist tone that could include high leverage capital requirements,” Seiberg said.
CONTROVERSIAL CHOICES
Trump's plans to overhaul regulation are being held up by the government's current lean crew of regulators.
While the Senate voted on Tuesday to confirm attorney Jay Clayton to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, the OCC's changing of the guard might not be so smooth.
Democrats have criticized practices at OneWest, the lender created by Mnuchin after the 2008 housing crisis that foreclosed on 36,000 California families. Mnuchin hired Otting as chief executive of the bank in 2010 and he held that role until it was bought by CIT Group in 2014.
Noreika's background as a lawyer who has advised banks on M&A, including Ant Financial's acquisition of Moneygram, as well as on the Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from making speculative bets, is also controversial.
“It is disturbing that the President is rushing to replace Mr. Curry with an acting appointee who has clear conflicts of interest, and lacks any experience in running such an important agency,” Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement.
Noreika's appointment does not require Senate approval.
Curry, a career regulator, was appointed by the Obama administration for a five-year term that expired last month and has since been serving under an extension.
While Curry took a tough line on risky lending, the agency did come under fire for its failure to tackle a sales practice abuse scandal at Wells Fargo & Co.
The OCC is also trying to establish itself as a regulator of online lenders and financial technology firms. State authorities have argued that is their job and are suing the OCC, arguing it lacks the legal authority to offer a banking charter for technology companies.
There are also three vacant spots on the Federal Reserve Board, including the post of vice chair of supervision, which will play a key role in any overhaul of bank regulation.
Earlier on Wednesday, Mnuchin told a conference of community bankers that Trump had signed off on a nominee to fill the vice chair role but did not name the person. Reuters had previously reported that Randal Quarles, who worked as under secretary for domestic finance at the Treasury under President George W. Bush, was a leading candidate.
Mnuchin said the administration was also close to naming the two other Fed selections.

Peter Fabricius Sudan's President Omar el Bashir reportedly touched down at Waterkloof Airforce base near Pretoria on Saturday. And it emerged that the South African government had urgently dispatched an envoy to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague to explain why it was letting him into the country and not arresting him.
Bashir had been keeping everyone guessing all week about whether he would arrive in Johannesburg for the African Union (AU) summit. He is wanted by the ICC for genocide and other crimes and South Africa as an ICC member is obliged to arrest him.
But late on Saturday evening he was reported to have arrived at Waterkloof Airforce base en route to the AU summit in Sandton, Johannesburg.
When Bashir was due to visit South Africa for President Jacob Zuma's inauguration in 2009 and for the World Cup in 2010, South African officials warned ahead of time that he would be arrested if he arrived. He did not come.
But the South African government's argument this time is that this is an AU event and so it does not have control over who attends. Bashir was invited to the summit and the AU, in fact, has a policy that its member states should not cooperate with the ICC.
Yesterday South Africa's ambassador to the Netherlands and the ICC, Bruce Koloane, met officials of the ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda to put forward that argument.
Anton du Plessis, executive director of the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) in Pretoria said last night he had heard that Koloane explained to the ICC that Bashir should enjoy diplomatic immunity from arrest because it was the AU and not South Africa which had invited him.
This argument was evidently based on a comparison with the United Nations in New York which foreign leaders attend without fear of arrest even if they are wanted by the United States government for crimes.
Du Plessis said he understood that the ICC Prosecutor's office had rejected South Africa's argument outright, arguing that there was no comparison with the UN and New York.
They pointed out that the UN had an immunity agreement with the US regarding attendance at the UN, whereas South Africa had no such agreement.
It is understood that the National Prosecuting Agency had issued a red notice to the South African Police Service to arrest Bashir if he did land. But it is not likely that the police will execute the arrest warrant if the government instructs it not to.
Du Plessis said what the government was evidently doing was “clearly wrong. South Africa had decided to ignore its obligations, not only to international law, but also a domestic legal obligation.
“The ICC Implementation Act which obliges the South African government to arrest fugitives from ICC justice is a domestic law. South Africa has decided on the basis of African solidarity and anti-ICC sentiment in the AU to renege on its own national legal obligations.
“This is a sad day for South Africa which until now has been a great champion of the ICC and of international justice.”
Du Plessis said that some were saying this was the death knell for the ICC. But he said it was more damaging to South Africa than to the ICC.
The ICC has been struggling, especially in its efforts to try Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta. The ICC's chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda eventually dropped the case against him because she couldn't muster enough evidence, largely because so many witnesses disappeared mysteriously.
The AU turned against the ICC because it said the court was biased against Africa as every one of the people it had indicted so far had been African.
South African government officials have been running for cover at the summit, refusing to confirm or deny that Bashir was coming. Even as the reports came in that his presidential aircraft Sudan One had landed at Waterkloof, International Relations and Cooperation Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, claimed to know nothing.
“ I have been very busy with meetings at the summit so I really don't know,” she said.
Another South African official said “it would totally destroy our standing in the AU if we arrested him”.
The ICC's usual response to such defiance of the obligations of member states, is to refer them to the UN Security Council for action. So far the council has not penalised any state for doing so.
We look at the myths being lined up to 'cure' gay and lesbian people of their sexuality
While many of us know homosexuality is normal, plenty of homophobes keep spreading myths that ‘gay cure' therapies work.
More vulnerable gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people are falling victim to these poisonous arguments, often used by their families, their church or even their country.
‘Gay cure' or reparative therapy propaganda seems to be steamrolling, such as last month when religious activists booked an ‘ex-gay' advert on London buses. Meanwhile, in the US, their main scientific advocate has withdrawn his support.
So we have decided to bust the top eight ‘gay cure' myths used by homophobes who say they are only trying to help.
Myth: Prayer will turn you straight
If you're religious, prayer can do wonderful things. However, it cannot change something as fundamental as which gender you want to have sex with.
‘Gay cure' therapies are mostly only offered by religious people or groups, and they all say praying to God will help turn you straight.
If you pray every night hoping for success, the lack of results will only make you feel like you have failed your God and your family.
Pink Therapy UK's Dominic Davies says the failure can actually make religious people ‘very depressed, and in many cases actively suicidal.'
Myth: All gay people need to get over the fact they were sexually abused
It may seem unbelievable, but some therapists believe the reason people have gay sex is because they were abused as a child.
Shrink Lesley Pilkington, who was exposed by journalist Patrick Strudwick for preaching ‘gay cures' in therapy sessions, told Strudwick he must have been sexually abused.
When Strudwick replied he was not, she said: ‘It is something within you, but outside your mind. Is it ok with you if we ask the Holy Spirit to help you to bring these things to your conscious mind?'
If a child suffers at the hands of a paedophile, the traumatic event will likely interfere with their development. However, there is no evidence that a child ‘born heterosexual' would have been straight if it was not for the abuse.
Myth: Homosexuality is a sickness, and that can be cured
If homophobes like to point out there has been little evidence of a ‘gay gene', there is no science whatsoever that says homosexuality is a ‘sickness' or an ‘addiction'.
France was one of the first countries to legalise homosexuality in 1791. In comparison, the UK declassified homosexuality as an illness in 1967, and the US followed in 1973.
If all the major world health organisations and governments now realise homosexuality is not a plague, or a mental aberration, then it is time the homophobes catch up to modern thinking.
Myth: Studies by psychiatrists have found reparative therapy works
When Pilkington was looking for arguments for her defence, she said in a Channel 4 News interview that pioneer psychiatrist Bob Spitzer had proven in a study that reparative therapy works.
Last April Spitzer said he now wants to retract his 2001 study which proclaimed that gay and lesbian people could change their sexual orientation.
He said: ‘I believe I owe the gay community an apology for my study making unproven claims of the efficacy of reparative therapy.
‘I also apologize to any gay person who wasted time and energy undergoing some form of reparative therapy because they believed that I had proven that reparative therapy works with some “highly motivated” individuals.'
Myth: Therapists will recruit you if they are gay, or convert you if they are straight
Sexuality is not like choosing which sports team you support. People can attempt to convince and cajole you as much as they like, but it is impossible to change a basic brain framework.
Paranoid reparative therapists often say confused patients should not be seen by liberal psychologists, otherwise they could be ‘recruited by the gays'.
A study by Professor Michael King at University College London Medical School surveyed 1328 non-religious counsellors who were asked if they would enter into a contract to change a patient's sexual attractions, and one in six agreed.
Davies told Gay Star News: ‘A naÃ¯ve therapist will sit there and say “Of course I will help you with whatever you want to work on” and start trying, blindly, to try to do some therapy with that person. It's not going to work but they will agree to the contract.
‘And that's where the therapy training organisations have a duty of care to the community and to the people they're training to make sure when a client comes in to that situation, the therapist can say with some authority there is nothing wrong with you.'
Myth: Ex-gays never feel any same-sex attraction again
After many years of blindly praying, attending church, and promising to never think about a person with the same genitals ever again, it still will not work.
Ex-gays preaching about their newly heterosexual lives are liars, unless they have found some vague latent bisexual functioning.
For example founder of ‘National Coming Out of Homosexuality Day' Michael Johnston resigned in 2003 after he allegedly had unprotected sex with men he met on the Internet.
John Paulk was the chairman of Exodus International and founded the ‘Focus on the Family' conference. He had appeared on Oprah and Good Morning America as well as appearing on the cover of Newsweek during a 1998 ex-gay ad campaign. In 2000 he was photographed in a Washington gay bar, and lost his job for his hypocrisy.
Myth: Electric shocks/Invasive surgery/Playing sports and cooking will turn you straight
There are many horrific ‘techniques' gay people have used to try to change their sexuality, with all of them ranging from simply ineffective to highly dangerous.
In the 1920s Germany, mainstream medical researchers implanted testicles from dead straight corpses into the bodies of gay men, usually without their knowledge, in an effort to boost their testosterone levels. Hormone therapy is still used today – hoping testosterone will boost a man's ‘masculinity'.
In the 1950s and 1960s Britain, behavioural therapy was used to try to cure ‘gay men'. Men convicted of homosexual acts were routinely given electric shock treatment, hallucinogenic drugs and subjected to brainwashing techniques.
In scenes similar to film ‘A Clockwork Orange', men were shown pictures of naked men and given a series of electric shocks or drugs to make them vomit.
In 1994 the American Psychological Association said this dangerous practice did not work as aversion therapy often led to suicide and mental illness in the patient.
Patients who enter group therapy to cure their sexuality are often told that engaging in gender-specific activities like sports or cooking will encourage them to be straight.
Try telling that to hardman rugby player Gareth Thomas, who came out in 2009. Or to Cat Cora, a lesbian who was the first female winner of American television programme ‘Iron Chef'.
Myth: ‘Gay cure' therapy cannot do any harm
It can, and it will. If someone tries to lie to themselves, and tries to convince their brain they are not gay, a likely result will be mental illness, depression, and thoughts of suicide.
A 2002 study by the clinical psychologists Shidlo and Schroeder found that 55% of people who go through conversion therapy are left with worsened mental health.
Sometimes when you are young and living in a religious family, coming out is not the right thing to do. Gay Star Newsreader Jimmy, who asked us to not include his last name, said when he came out at 14 his mother told him he had to go to a priest to ‘fix' him.
Jimmy backtracked out of fear, and said: ‘From that moment our relationship changed and damage was done that can never be repaired.'
Sometimes people are blinded by their beliefs, even when it comes at the cost of their own children.
If you are confused about your sexuality, then the answer is not to repress your feelings. Go and see a therapist who is trained and can give impartial, valuable advice.
Pink Therapy's Davies says: ‘It is important patients ask their therapist what their attitudes and what their experience and what their training has been.
‘That way, they don't waste their time and money on someone who has had no training or has negative attitudes, or think that homosexuality is an aberration. Clearly, that is not going to be a healthy path for them.'
Whether the Saskatchewan government is choosing the right course with public private partnerships (P3s) or rejecting changes to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) seems debatable … or at least, a matter of one's political perspective.
Not withstanding (or perhaps because of) the government's staunch defence of P3s — there were no fewer than four ministers recently touting a pricey Ernst and Young report on the $90 million taxpayers are allegedly saving on the new Saskatchewan Hospital at North Battleford — there are those who point to public-sector auditors who totally disagree with their private-sector accountant brethren on the value of such P3s.
Similarly, Saskatchewan Finance Minister Kevin Doherty appeared to be the lone voice at Monday's national finance ministers' meeting, where he opposed the federal Liberal campaign promise to change Canada Pension Plan contributions and benefits.
“It's a payroll tax on the business community,” Doherty said last week. “In very, very tight economic times like this, it might not mean the difference of laying off a staff person or two. It might mean shutting down the entire restaurant.”
The thing is, though, the Saskatchewan Party government opposed such “tax increases” in boom times as well, leaving one to wonder whether this government ever sees a time when low-salaried workers or the self-employed should get additional government support for their retirements.
At a time of minimal wage increases, rising unemployment and growing part-time and service sector jobs found necessary by many trying to make ends meet, it does cause one to wonder whether now might be a time to set aside one's philosophical opposition to an improved CPP.
In a somewhat similar vein, Doherty said he does support the Liberals' campaign promise to double infrastructure spending, but under the caveat that the Saskatchewan government be able to spend its share on P3 highways, water treatment facilities and even bypass projects and not on transit projects as the federal government would prefer.
It's common sense that Doherty should advocate Saskatchewan deciding for itself how best to spend infrastructure dollars. Furthermore, he has a point that while public transit may be more important for cities like Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal or even Regina and Saskatoon, “transit's not the top of our list” in Saskatchewan.
But what Doherty and the Sask. Party seem to really be defending is the old federal government system under Stephen Harper's Conservatives that rewarded/subsidized governments for simply using P3 models (see: Regina sewage treatment plant) — whether the concept made any practical sense or not.
Doherty denies his government is “stuck” on P3s for ideological reasons, but the lengths his government has gone to demonstrate P3s work suggests quite the opposite.
In fact, Premier Brad Wall seems to be swinging the Sask. Party hard to the right, just months before the April 4 vote.
Be it his government's push for liquor store privatization or his recent caution on federal Liberal plans to quickly bring thousands of Syrian refugees to Canada (after being among the first leaders last summer to call on Ottawa to do more) or his hardline oil-sector support before and during the Paris climate summit, or Doherty's pronouncements on P3s and the CPP, this is a government marking its right-wing territory.
It's odd timing for any government, given that in the months before an election most governing parties go out of their way to demonstrate how inclusive they are. Making it even odder is the fact that elections across the country this year — including that national vote we had on Oct. 19 — suggest an electorate that's moving to the left.
Wall and the Sask. Party's defence of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) dictates on the CPP, Harper's view on P3s or even pandering to the right's view on Syria at a time when the pendulum seems to be swinging the other way is a curious political strategy.
We'll know about four months from now whether it was the right approach — or the one that gives the NDP the opening it has needed.

SAN FRANCISCO – With an overwhelming strike authorization vote Oct. 22, workers are ratcheting up the pressure on the city's top hotels to end their stalling, drop demands for takeaways and agree to a fair contract. Many of the city's most prominent hotels are among the 31 affected by the vote.
With more than 3,000 workers casting ballots, over 93 percent voted to authorize Unite Here Local 2's bargaining committee to call actions up to and including strikes, if necessary. In the meantime workers are remaining on the job. The union is calling a “day of action” from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Oct. 27, at an as-yet-unspecified hotel.
Speaking to reporters as the vote was in progress, Local 2 President Mike Casey said employers are proposing “deep, unjustifiable and impossible cuts” in bargaining ongoing since mid-August, when the previous contract expired.
The union has proposed two options: a one year contract keeping affordable family health care and making “extremely modest” adjustments to wages and pensions, and a three year pact addressing core issues including continued affordable family health coverage, better dental and retirement benefits, fair wage increases and guarantees of reasonable workloads.
Though the corporations “may be crying the blues right now,” Casey said, “all the analysts indicate that in 2011-2012, we're going to see a rebound” in the hotel industry as well as in the economy generally, and hotel workers must also benefit from the upswing.
Meanwhile, he said, the hotels are “seeking to use the economy as an excuse to combine jobs, shorten shifts, require workers to pay for health care, and reduce pensions,” in the hope of accomplishing what they could not during talks for the previous contract in 2004-2006.
As in most contract talks throughout the country, health care tops the list of issues. Though negotiations are taking place separately with the various hotel corporations, overall the union says they are trying to cut health care contributions, putting workers on a path to huge monthly copays and/or drastically reduced benefits. Several are also proposing combined job classifications, new four-hour shifts, and cuts in starting rates.
Addressing the reporters, Ringo Mak, a server at the Hilton Hotel, underscored the health care issue's seriousness: “If they don't give us the health benefits, we will have to go to San Francisco General Hospital [the city's public hospital] and the burden will fall back on the city. I don't think anybody should want that. The hotel is making a profit every year, and that makes what we're asking for affordable.”
The union points out that in the “boom period” of 2004-2008, hotel corporations made record profits of over $110 billion in North America, and that they remain profitable even under current conditions.
Workers participating in the strike authorization vote included room cleaners, dischwashers, cooks, bell staff, servers, bussers, bartenders and others. Their earnings average $30,000 to $35,000 annually. About 40 percent are of Asian/Pacific Island descent and another 30 percent are Latino.

Women have always been at Harvard, Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz AM '65, PhD '69, RI '01 noted in her lecture “It's Complicated: 375 Years of Women at Harvard,” but for many years they were present as workers and donors or helpmeets to fathers, husbands, and sons. From the University's founding, in 1636, until 1879, when Elizabeth Cary Agassiz and other women established the Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women, known as the Annex, there were no women students at Harvard.
“The Annex began with no building,” Horowitz pointed out, “only rented rooms on Appian Way,” where Harvard faculty members taught the women's classes.
The Sydenham Clark Parsons Professor of American Studies and History Emerita at Smith College, Horowitz spoke at the Institute in late April, presenting a Radcliffe Dean's Lecture as part of Harvard's celebration of its first 375 years. She was a member of the Radcliffe Institute's first class of fellows and has conducted extensive research at the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe, most recently for her book Wild Unrest: Charlotte Perkins Gilman and the Making of “The Yellow Wallpaper” (Oxford University Press, 2010).
The fiercest opposition to women's inclusion at Harvard occurred during the 1970s, Horowitz said, when students and the National Organization for Women fought for a one-to-one ratio in the admission of men and women instead of the four-to-one ratio that then prevailed. Starting in 1977, women's numbers gradually increased until they reached parity in 2007.
There's been real success at the administrative level in recent years, Horowitz said, with 7 of the 16 members of the Harvard Council of Deans being women. But opening the faculty to women has been more difficult. In 1985, the high point, women made up roughly a quarter of the faculty.
She's “haunted,” Horowitz said, by the statement made by biologist Ruth Hubbard '44, AM '47, PhD '50 about the impact on her generation of Radcliffe students not being taught by women. “Sitting ‘at the feet of Harvard's Great Men' may mean students do not awaken to the ‘expectation that we might someday be Great Women.'”
Compared to 25, 50, or 75 years ago, there's a lot to celebrate, the noted historian concluded. “But there is a lot to try to change and a lot to worry about, too. Yes, the history of women at Harvard is complicated.”
“No Documents, No History”
Before the Horowitz lecture, Nancy F. Cott spoke to a gathering of Radcliffe alumnae and friends about the importance of Radcliffe's Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America. The Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation Director of the library and Jonathan Trumbull Professor of American History, Cott recalled how important it had been for her to be able to turn to the Schlesinger in 1970, when she was a graduate student preparing to teach one of the earliest courses in women's history. Influenced by the women's movement, she distrusted previous historians' accounts, assuming they were full of stereotyped assumptions about women. “I was able to look on the shelves of the Schlesinger and find one primary source after another” for students to read, she said, since the library (originally the Women's Archives) had been collecting for more than 25 years by then.
Crediting the mid-1940s vision of Radcliffe College in intending to establish “a national center for research in the historical role and cultural contributions of the women in the United States,” Cott noted the essential role played by historian Mary Ritter Beard (1876–1958) in enabling the library's first contacts and collections. Cott quoted her mantra: “No documents, no history. Papers. Records. These we must have.”
A Crystal Lake couple is $2.5 million richer after they won big in the Illinois Lottery.
Roy and Gail Voigt won the Lotto jackpot prize when their ticket matched all six numbers in a Nov. 17 drawing, according to a news release.
"We are shocked that we won! It hasn't sunk in yet," Gail Voigt said.
Roy and Gail have been playing the same Lotto numbers, 02-11-31-36-37-48, for several years.
"I just chose some random numbers and stuck with them," Roy said.
A few weeks after the drawing, they checked the winning numbers on the Illinois Lottery website and discovered they had hit the jackpot. They plan to get professional financial advice and invest their windfall.
The winning ticket was purchased at Thorntons, 800 Northwest Highway, in Cary. The retailer received a bonus of $22,500, or one percent of the prize amount, for selling a winning ticket.

The comedian's response to an accusation of racist jokes has us wondering why it's so damn hard to apologize in 2017.
No one knows how the hell to apologize anymore.
Consider David Cross, star of Alvin and the Chipmunks, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, and Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked. On Wednesday morning, poet Charlyne Yi posted a series of tweets alleging that Cross made a series of racist jokes upon meeting Yi ten years ago. Cross, also on Twitter, responded initially with shock and promised to "get to the bottom of this" and asked "Charlene" to reach out privately.
Then came one of the most well-rehearsed rituals in the world of celebrity social media, the public non-apology, delivered via screenshot of the iPhone's Notes app:
This is a sterling example of Doing It Wrong. In a single passage, Cross:
Made it about him. Emphatically stated he did not remember the incident in question. Stressed that he is not calling his accuser a liar. Said "I'm truly sorry if I hurt her." Emphatically stated that he does not remember things going down this way and y'know, maybe she doesn't either? Said "I am not a racist or a bully." "#Rashomon."
That last bit is particularly infuriating, since Rashomon is the title of an Akira Kurosawa film about conflicting accounts regarding a rape and murder, so yes, that hashtag is objectively in awful taste. And it's a particularly egregious unforced error in this case, when a sincere apology for this incident, even if he didn't remember it happening, would have cost him nothing. Except, you know, the admission that he might have been rude to someone once.
The note also commits the cardinal sin of just about every poor celebrity apology: the'm sorry if I hurt/offended anyone play. This is a trash move that completely misses the entire point of apologies and falls to pieces the moment you scrutinize it. Because apologies aren't conditional. If you are only sorry if someone was hurt or offended, you're just sorry you got caught and called out for it. Abolish it from your diction.
Writing an apology is, for what it's worth, not that hard. Just know:
You've gotta acknowledge that someone was hurt by you. Take responsibility for it. People mess up. It's not great, but most of us will understand. You've just got to make a sincere effort to do better. Maybe there will be consequences, but you're an adult and that's how things work. And holy shit on a goddamn chipmunk, don't make a joke implying that your accuser's account is untrustworthy.
Apologies aren't meant to cover your ass or assert that you Are In Fact A Good Person. They are entirely for the benefit of the person who was hurt. It is belatedly putting yourself aside as a gesture to make amends for a time that you failed to think of someone other than yourself. That's it! Apologizing is a wonderfully simple act. It is not contextual or complicated or ever-changing; the steps are always the same. Maybe, based on the severity of the accusation, the actions you have to take after apologizing are more involved, but the apology itself remains straightforward.
Watch now:
Despite a security breach earlier this year, Red Hat is out today with its tenth release of the Fedora Linux distribution, promising new open source security, virtualization and appliance-building technologies.
The release of Fedora 10, codenamed Cambridge, had been delayed following the security breach in the Red Hat Fedora infrastructure. The launch also comes as Fedora is in the spotlight after Red Hat claimed that the distro has over 9.5 million machines running its software -- a figure that it would make it the most widely installed Linux distribution.
Fedora insiders said the delay caused by the security breach didn't dramatically upset the distribution's launch timing.
"If you look at our original schedule we were supposed to release around Oct. 28 and here we are, four weeks later than what we expected," Paul Frields, Fedora's project leader, told InternetNews.com. The outage itself lasted about three weeks, he added, "and during that time, our infrastructure team nuked our infrastructure and rebuilt the entire thing."
Frields explained that during the outage, the Fedora project ceased producing its RAWHIDE daily builds, which help to push development of the mainline release -- ultimately impacting the release date.
On the other hand, Frields argued that the infrastructure shutdown enabled Fedora to make some improvements to its backend infrastructure that otherwise might not have been possible.
"We reconstructed everything from scratch and after those three weeks, we really only lost a week on top of that compared to our original schedule," Frields said. "So we look at it as a fairly successful release overall, given the circumstances that we had to work with."
Fedora has not yet issued full details on the root cause of its breach, and whether or not it involved malicious hacker activity. Frields said Fedora plans on issuing a final report on the issue in the future, once it's fully detailed the problem. He added that producing a complete and accurate report is a priority for both himself and for the Fedora community.
Improvements in Fedora 10
While security for Fedora's own internal infrastructure is a key concern of the team, security also was a key theme in the Fedora 10 release as well.
A new security audit tool, called secTool, enables users to see if a system configuration has any security flaws. SecTool is also a framework that can be leveraged by users to build their own security tests.
Fedora 10 also helps to expand appliance options with its Appliance Tools technology, a feature that's intended to make it easier for developers and independent software vendors to build Fedora-based appliances. Appliance Tools include the ACT (Appliance Creation Tool) and the AOS (The Appliance Operating System), which is a stripped down version of Fedora.
The hope is that developers could use the tools to build virtual software appliance, LiveCD based appliances or even bare-metal hardware appliances.
As part of the appliance effort, Fedora also is launching a new branding effort, with a Fedora Remix logo that can be used by developers to identify their Fedora-based appliances -- similar to Intel's "Intel Inside" logo program. Frields noted that Fedora's inclusion of Appliance Tools is part of a larger open source effort to develop Linux-based appliances, which Red Hat is sponsoring with its new Thincrust.net project.
Beyond appliances, virtualization also gets a boost in Fedora 10 with the new VirtRemoteInstall tool. Frields explained that the tool extends the capabilities of virtualization on Fedora, making it easier for admins to create virtual machines on remote hosts. VirtRemoteInstall is an extension of the Fedora-developed libvirt technology, which is an open source wrapper for managing virtualization.
Libvirt is used by other Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, as a key part of its virtualization feature set.
"Libvirt abstracts away the underlying hypervisor technology, so that you can use the same tools to manage your virtual machines -- whether they are based on Xen or KVM," Frields said.
Overall, Frields is very confident in the features that Fedora 10 is offering. It's a confidence that is based on past experience with features like libvirt.
"I feel that we have an incredibly healthy community and we know we are providing great features because they end up in every other distribution," Frields said. "We're happy that things work that way -- it's the open source way. If another distro uses a Fedora-developed feature, it puts it in front of more users, and then we can improve it faster."
A lawyer for President Donald Trump on Monday signaled that he will seek to dismiss a lawsuit filed against Trump in New York, arguing that the President is immune to lawsuits filed against him in state court.
Trump is looking to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed in New York state Supreme Court by Summer Zervos, a past contestant on Trump's reality television show, “The Apprentice.” Zervos filed the lawsuit in January, after Trump denied her allegations that he kissed and groped her inappropriately in 2007 at a hotel in Los Angeles.
In a filing submitted on Monday, Trump's lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, argued that “the United States Constitution, including the Supremacy Clause contained therein, immunizes the President from being sued in state court while in office.” He noted that in Clinton v. Jones, which established that Presidents are not immune from federal lawsuits over actions they took before taking office, the U.S. Supreme Court did not decide whether the President could be sued in state court.
Indeed, the U.S. Supreme Court noted in its decision that it was not ruling on presidential immunity for lawsuits filed in state courts, according to Suzanna Sherry, a law professor at Vanderbilt University.
Kasowitz asked the state Supreme Court to decide whether Trump has immunity from the lawsuit before otherwise proceeding with the case. He wrote that “allowing litigation on the merits to proceed prior to resolution of this crucial and threshold constitutional issue would unduly burden the President and would defeat the purpose of Presidential immunity,” and stated that Clinton v. Jones established that courts should address the issue of immunity before taking other actions in such a case.
He wrote that Trump intends to file a motion to either dismiss the case or postpone it until after his presidency.
Sherry told TPM in an email that she suspects the New York state Supreme Court may not dismiss the case on immunity grounds.
“My best guess is that the NY state court will not dismiss on immunity grounds, and the question will eventually end up at the US Supreme Court,” Sherry wrote.
But Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, told TPM that there's a chance a court could dismiss the case because it could occupy a lot of the President's time.
“In Jones, the Court suggested that a civil suit would not occupy too much of the president's time. Yet Clinton v Jones led directly to Clinton's impeachment. Given that history, one might predict the Court would be reluctant to allow more civil suits to go forward during Trump's term in office,” Winkler wrote in an email.

Cotton is a great fiber to make clothes with, but unfortunately, growing it causes huge environmental problems. It's a crop that uses a lot of water, and most large cotton monocultures are doused in large quantities of pesticides. On top of that, growing cotton requires arable land, so it competes with food crops.
But as the human population of the planet goes up and as hundreds of millions of people get out of abject poverty, they'll require more food andclothes. This leaves us with a big dilemma, unless we can find another source of fibers that doesn't suffer from the downsides associated with cotton...
A Multitude of Benefits
Ah! But how about cellulose from trees? With it we can make rayon, the modern version of which is pretty much a direct substitute for cotton, except that it is even better adapted to the climate of most developing countries than cotton because it breathes better and it's more absorbant.
And the benefits don't stop there: Cellulose from trees doesn't compete with food crops for arable land. They don't require pesticides, and if the forest is managed with the best sustainable practices, a lot of fiber can be had without damaging the local ecosystem too much.
Even better: The cellulose is just one of the components of wood. You can use the lignin to run a biomass cogeneration power plant that powers the cellulose plant (known more technically as a dissolving pulp plant) and even sell excess power back to the grid, and other sugars from the wood can be turned into all kinds of other useful things in a biorefinery. If done well, it's possible to squeeze a lot of utility out of each tree, which would be a big improvement over most of what we currently do with trees.

If you want to dig deeper into this, I found an interesting paper on the subject: The Cellulose Gap (pdf).
Some highlights:
Within the next two decades the world population will grow by 1.4 billion and is moving up the food chain. By 2030 we will have an additional demand for food of 43 %. On the other hand arable land is limited and the cropland area per person will shrink. This situation will result in a food crisis. Also the demand for textile fibres (natural as well as man-made) will increase by 84 %. But in the future cotton production will be stagnant because of the limited availability of arable land. The experience shows that approximately one third of textile fibres have to be cellulosic fibres because of certain properties like absorbency and moisture management. This will result in a disproportionately high demand for man-made cellulosic fibres in the coming years. The substitution of cotton by man-made cellulose fibres is also a contribution to the environmental protection.

The greatest challenge for American leaders is finding the “wit and wisdom” to focus more attention on the Asia-Pacific.
During a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Tuesday, Kurt Campbell, Chairman and CEO of The Asia Group, told the Senators that “the lion's share of the history of the 21st century is going to be written in Asia. There's just no doubt about it.”
Campbell served in the U.S. Department of State under Hillary Clinton from 2009 to 2013 as assistant secretary for East Asia and the Pacific, and has been called one of the architects of the U.S. “pivot” to Asia policy.
In his remarks to the Senate committee, Campbell said that that while most would agree that economic power is shifting dramatically to the Asia-Pacific, the United States is “consumed with the Middle East and South Asia” and will be for some time. He commented that the greatest challenge for congressional and executive branch leaders would be to find the “wit and wisdom” to focus more attention on the Asia-Pacific.
Campbell noted that the “biggest concern in Asia is not just the dysfunctionality of our government, it is that we are preoccupied” away from the region and that the more the U.S. tries to convince its partners in Asia of U.S. attention, the less they believe it.
The rebalance narrative has evolved, from “we're back in Asia “ to “we never left.” Campbell says both these assessments are right in some light but also “profoundly wrong.” He also noted that the costs associated with getting more involved in Asia have risen:
Ladies and gentlemen, for us to be effective in Asia going forward, the price of admittance to get into the disco has gone up dramatically. We've got to spend much more time and attention, focus more of our military, our trade, our economic engagement to be successful in Asia. That's what's expected…
Campbell gave a nod to the distantly looming 2016 American presidential election, noting that “one of the great benefits of Asia is that this is essentially a bipartisan commitment.” He said that whatever “small steps” have been taken to date must be sustained over several administrations going forward. Foreign policy seldom plays a pivotal role in U.S. elections, but what campaign space there is will certainly have Asia as a major issue. What to do next with the rebalance strategy President Obama will hand his successor is one of the questions candidates will have to answer on the road to the White House.
While the military aspect of U.S. engagement in Asia is the “big ticket,” Campbell emphasized how important the Trans-Pacific Partnership is. According to Campbell, the U.S. could “do everything right” diplomatically in Asia, but without the settling of the TPP would only earn a “C-” grade over the next two years.
Campbell wasn't alone in highlighting TPP for the Senate Armed Services Committee, another panelist included in the hearing–Michael Green–said that “should negotiations on TPP falter this year, there will be new doubts about the strategic competence and staying power of the United States in Asia and the Pacific.”
Admiral Gary Roughead, USN (Ret.), whose remarks were largely devoted to assessing the growth and evolution of the PLAN as well as recommendations for how to develop U.S. capabilities with the Asia-Pacific theater in mind, concluded by saying that “TPP and TPA (Trade Promotion Authority) is extraordinarily important.” He noted that China's One Belt, One Road strategy has two components–military and economic–and that U.S. strategy ought to couple economic initiatives with military ones.
“We can't simply be a military one-trick pony,” he said.

A San Jose man is facing a maximum of life in prison for something many fathers would be tempted to do — badly beating a Thanksgiving weekend houseguest who molested his 8-year-old stepdaughter.
Surely the suspected molester, who has confessed to the sexual attack and even apologized to the child, is in worse trouble than the stepfather?
Actually, the stepfather is facing the possibility of spending more time behind bars — perhaps his entire life.
The stiff penalty the stepfather faces for his allegedly violent reaction to what many would consider extreme provocation has lawyers debating whether he deserves leniency.
Nationwide, penalties for other fathers in high-profile cases who have beaten up — or even killed — men they believed molested their children range from 12 years in prison to mere probation.
The controversial Santa Clara County case follows a similar incident on the verge of trial here — the revenge beating of a priest by a man who says the cleric molested him when he was a child.
Without condoning vigilantism, defense attorneys and some legal scholars contend the girl's stepfather deserves to be treated far more leniently — especially because if he had killed the houseguest in a rage, the most he could get under California's perplexing sentencing scheme would be 11 years. The attack came after the 8-year-old woke up her mother at about 2 a.m., saying the family's friend had duct-taped her mouth and sexually abused her.
“I have a 10-year-old daughter and I'm not at all sure I'd act differently or regret it if I did,” said Scott Altman, a law-school professor at the University of Southern California and expert in jurisprudence.
But Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen makes no apologies for throwing the book at stepfather Miguel Cerda and his brother Erik, who is also accused of participating in the Nov. 26 beating.
He has filed the maximum felony charges possible — torture, mayhem, battery, assault and making criminal threats. According to the police report, Avelino Rodriguez had two black eyes, a broken jaw, missing teeth, several burn marks that could have been made by a cigarette on one of his hips, and bruising from what appeared to be a whipping. Rosen said his office also came down hard on the brothers because they didn't act immediately in the heat of the moment; they drove Rodriguez from San Jose to a Gilroy ranch where the beating took place.
“This is not the way we settle disputes in a civilized society,” Rosen said. “Certainly we understand the mitigating circumstances, but we can't give somebody a pass for this.”
The charges against the Cerdas carry a sentence of seven years to life in prison. It would be up to the parole board after they served seven years whether to ever let them out — a risk that defense attorneys in the case say is out of line considering the circumstances.
“There's no guarantee about the parole board,” said Ruben Munoz, Miguel Cerda's lawyer. “If we went to trial and lost, it would be a miscarriage of justice.”
Rodriguez, on the other hand, pleaded no contest to two felony counts of oral copulation or sexual penetration with a child 14 years old or younger. Under the plea bargain, he will be sentenced to 22 years in prison and could be released after 19 years.
Rosen said prosecutors and defense attorneys could reach a plea deal in the Cerdas' case that would result in reduced charges and less prison time than Rodriguez will get. Sources said prosecutors have offered six to eight years in state prison. The trial is set for next month if the case isn't settled. Erik Cerda doesn't have a criminal record. Miguel Cerda has been convicted of misdemeanor battery for hitting a 10-year-old and slapping and punching his girlfriend. But Rosen said that “his background did not sway me either way.”
The proposed plea deal is not good enough for Erik Cerda's lawyers, who are seeking either probation or a short jail sentence, or at most two years in prison.
“Each of us certainly understands that the first reaction of a caring family member to the report of the sexual molest of a loved one would be emotional and impulsive,” said Supervising Deputy Public Defender Damon Silver, who oversees all felony cases. “We are optimistic that the District Attorney's Office will recognize these basic human responses as they review the case to determine whether sending someone to prison for six to eight years is consistent with the values of our community or excessive under these circumstances.”
In Florida earlier this year, a Broward County father got probation after bashing a man with rocks and concrete blocks hours after his child reported being sexually abused. The molester, who was sentenced to two life terms in prison, was injured so badly he had to be put in a medically induced coma.
Some legal scholars contend that such lenient treatment gives people the sense they can take the law into their own hands — and thus increases the chances of innocent people being badly hurt.
Indeed, in a 2006 Connecticut case, there are indications that patent lawyer Jonathon Edington, who fatally stabbed a neighbor he believed had molested his daughter, had been misinformed by his wife, who suffered from postpartum depression. Edington pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to 12 years in state prison — less than the potential life term the Cerdas are facing.

The Irish nanny accused of murdering a US baby is set to be freed after the charge against her was dramatically dropped last night.
Massachusetts state's medical examiner reversed its findings and concluded Aisling Brady McCarthy did not kill Rehma Sabir.
Her lawyer Melinda Thompson has revealed the 37-year-old from Cavan “pretty much can't stop crying out of joy" since receiving the news.
She told the Irish Mirror: “She's relieved, scared, and absolutely thankful to the medical examiner's office for redoing this review and quite frankly finding the truth.
“It was a tragedy that a child died of what appeared to be natural causes.”
Ms McCarthy is waiting for her immigration situation to be resolved and is hoping that she'll be able to return home to Cavan soon.
Reverend Kevin Fay, a priest in Lavey said Aisling's home-town were over-joyed at the dramatic U-turn made by US lawmakers.He said: “It's fantastic news, just fantastic news. It's brilliant news.
“We all know the family very well. Everyone will be delighted for them.
“This community has always been very supportive of the family, and I think she comes from a very, very decent family, very good people.
"So there's a sense of great relief for everybody because people would support Aisling very well here.”
The Cavan nanny, 37, denied harming the one-year-old at the child's family home in Cambridge near Boston on January 14, 2013.
Her defence solicitor Melinda Thompson said: “The life of an innocent woman was ruined. Ms McCarthy was put in jail for two and a half years over a crime that never occurred. Not just a crime that she did not commit, but a crime that did not occur. The life of an innocent woman was ruined.”
And two-and-a-half years after she was charged and jailed, she looks set to be freed thanks to a dramatic u-turn by the Massachusetts medical examiner's office.
Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan revealed: “Based on an assessment of the present state of the evidence, including the amended ruling from the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy, the Commonwealth cannot meet its burden of proof.”
The announcement came just hours after the medical examiner reversed its original finding that Rehma's death was murder caused by blunt force trauma to the head.
In his ruling, the examiner said the child's medical history “could have made her prone to easy bleeding with relatively minor trauma.”
He concluded: “I believe that enough evidence has been presented to raise the possibility that the bleeding could have been related to an accidental injury in a child with a bleeding risk or possibly could have even been a result of an undefined natural disease.
“In particular the overall state of Rehma's health and her past medical issues raise the possibility that she had some type of disorder that was not able to be completely diagnosed prior to her death.
“Given these uncertainties, I am no longer convinced that the subdural hemorrhage in this case could only have been caused by abusive/inflicted head trauma, and I can no longer rule the manner of death as a homicide.”

And with McCarthy Brady now set to walk free after the dramatic twist in the case that has gripped Ireland and America, her defence solicitor Melinda Thompson revealed: “Miss McCarthy was put in jail for 2 1/2 years over a crime that never occurred.
“Not just a crime that she did not commit, but a crime that did not occur. The life of an innocent woman was ruined.”
Under Massachusetts law, the medical examiner must conclude that the manner of death was a homicide for a criminal case to start.
The case is scheduled to be heard in Middlesex Superior Court on Wednesday.
McCarthy Brady was arrested in January 2013, five days after little Sabir was pronounced dead at Boston Children's Hospital, where she was rushed after the nanny found her unresponsive in her cot.
The Cavan childminder, who it emerged had been living illegally in the US since 2002, was denied bail and jailed.
But she was released on $15,000 cash bail by Superior Court Judge Maureen Hogan back in May, after the judge was assured the nanny would be deported if the criminal case against her ended.
Under conditions set by the court, McCarthy Brady was ordered to remain under house arrest at all times and wear a GPS tracking device.
She was forced to surrender her passport and is only allowed to leave her home for court dates, meetings with her legal team and doctor appointments.
The Massachusetts medical examiner's office originally concluded that Rehma's death was murder and that the cause of death was “blunt force trauma”.
That finding was influenced by grand jury testimony from Dr Alice Newton, a former Boston Children's Hospital child protection expert, who said the tragic tot's death was an example of shaken baby syndrome.
But after pressure from defense medical experts, the medical examiner's office made the unusual decision to reopen its inquiry.
And after spending the past several months reviewing forensic information, it has now ruled that the baby's death can no longer be considered a murder.
Prosecutors alleged that Rehma was in McCarthy Brady's exclusive care when she suffered massive brain injuries consistent with violent shaking, including extensive bleeding in her brain and the backs of her eyes.
Specialists argued the baby had suffered violent force and that the injuries could not have been inflicted before that day.
But defense medical experts noted that the child sustained bone and compression fractures several weeks before her death, when she was traveling abroad with her family without her nanny.
They also said Rehma had been sick for much of her short life and suffered from a bleeding disorder and gastrointestinal problems.
A trial date had been set for October and was expected to last up to six weeks.
The Massachusetts District Attorney was due to meet with tragic Rehma's family yesterday.
IF Year 12 students at one of WA's top academic high schools say they found today's first ATAR exam paper much harder than expected, it's likely that more than 3300 students who also studied physics will be feeling their pain.
Rossmoyne Senior High School student Caneesyah Arvi, 18, said she felt sick after finishing the three-hour physics exam today.
“That was honestly the most horrible exam ever,” she said. “This is the first one, so now I'm scared for the rest. It was much harder than the mock exams, 100 per cent.”
Charlie Li, 18, said he found the paper “challenging”.
“Doing a lot of revision over past papers probably wouldn't have helped that much,” he said. “I thought it was all very new stuff. But there wasn't anything ridiculously hard, it was just quite challenging overall.”
Victoria Lam, 17, also said the exam was harder than she thought it would be.
Science Teachers Association of WA president Stacey Fairhead said a number of physics teachers had indicated the paper was more difficult than in previous years.
“It is our hope that the students weren't too put off by this,” she said. “Students should be reassured that the standardisation procedures in place mean that all candidates will not be disadvantaged.”
More than 15,600 WA students will sit through four or more ATAR course exams over the next three weeks.
Subjects with the highest enrolments include English (11,282), mathematics applications (9166), chemistry (5061) and human biology (4923).
Education Minister Sue Ellery said students starting their final exams should stay positive and feel proud of what they have achieved so far.
“This is an important time, but students should remember not to be too tough on themselves and to trust in the hard work they've put in throughout their school life,” she said.
Jim Himes (D-CT)
I can't think of any other word for this but "obscene":
Staff at Goldman Sachs staff can look forward to the biggest bonus payouts in the firm's 140-year history after a spectacular first half of the year, sparking concern that the big investment banks which survived the credit crunch will derail financial regulation reforms. A lack of competition and a surge in revenues from trading foreign currency, bonds and fixed-income products has sent profits at Goldman Sachs soaring, according to insiders at the firm.
My initial thoughts?
Barry Ritholz was right. As he said in Bailout Nation, TARP was a ruse — "a $700 billion dollar pile of money in search of a justification for its existence." All that stuff about our financial infrastructure on the verge of collapse? Bullshit.
Those who said that if we got TARP we wouldn't get healthcare were probably right, too. We're now told that $1 trillion for health care over the next ten years ($100 billion a year) is just too reckless and irresponsible — by the same people who had no trouble with the $2 trillion we've thrown at the banks in the past year.
Former Goldman Sachs executive Jim Himes voted for every TARP bailout, for the $108 billion European bank bailout, for the war supplemental and every other spending bill that made its way down the pike. For him to now be talking about the need to "put on the brakes" and address the "massive unfunded liabilities associated with Social Security and Medicare" is really something.
As a former Goldman Sachs' executive who received more money from Goldman employees than any candidate who wasn't running for president in 2008 ($152,798), Himes has stayed close to his donors and calls them regularly before he takes key votes.
Maybe he can ask them about Goldman's suspicious trading activity, which Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge has been covering for a while now:
It's great that Jim has such close relationships with Goldman executives. As someone who sponsored legislation to make sure that the bonus packages of all TARP recipients were tied to company performance, I'm sure Jim will be the first to call for transparency on Goldman's part and make sure their "surging revenues" are legitimate before they start shelling out these fat chunks of taxpayer dollars during a recession.
No doubt Himes' Chief of Staff, former USB lobbyist Jason Cole, can be of tremendous help with this.
We are meeting at the south end of the High Level Bridge (East side).
Our Facebook event is: https://www.facebook.com/events/501183506930291/
Details
Get out your CD, cassette, or mp3 boombox, bundle up, and join us for Phil Kline's 45 minute interactive sound walk in Edmonton.
We will meet at the South End of the High Level Bridge (EAST SIDE). We will walk a loop. Crossing the bridge heading to the Legislature and then back across the bridge finishing near to where we began.
*FREE & ALL AGES WELCOME*
www.unsilentnight.com
WHAT IS IT?
Phil Kline's Unsilent Night is a free outdoor participatory sound sculpture of many individual parts, recorded on cassettes, CDs and mp3s, and played through a roving swarm of boomboxes carried through city streets every December. People bring their own boomboxes and drift
peacefully through a cloud of sound which is different from every listener's perspective. Since 1992, this 45-minute work has grown into a worldwide annual communal event that has become an essential part of many winter holiday celebrations. 2017 marks the seventh year of Unsilent Night in Edmonton.
WHAT DOES IT SOUND LIKE?
Most people consider it loud and joyous. Glittering and mysterious. The average effect seems to be somewhere between pacifying and invigorating. Joe Woodard of The Los Angeles Times describes it as "A dreamy fruitcake of parts, tranquil even through its anarchy." And K. Leander Williams in Time Out New York says “Kline's luminous, shimmering wash of bell tones is one of the loveliest communal new-music experiences you'll ever encounter, and it's never the same twice.” The Onion calls it “an ambient wash of heaven-sent shimmer, recognizable as seasonal mostly for its modulating bells and time-stretched hymnal melodies.”
HOW CAN I PARTICIPATE?
You do not need to bring a boombox to join in, but it is more fun if you can! For those that like to plan ahead, you can download the audio files ahead of time from www.unsilentnight.com/download.html to load onto your mp3 player, CD or cassette. We will have extra cassettes, CD's, and boomboxes available. We will also have mp3 speakers for those who bring iPods, smartphones, or other mp3 players. This year, an iPhone app is available, and an Android app is in the works too.
Please RSVP if you do need to borrow equipment, as there is a limited number of each item.
Plan to arrive a few minutes early to get set up.
Top White House aides said they would prevent a tabloid newspaper from publishing a negative story about MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough if they apologised to Donald Trump, the TV presenters have alleged.
Brzezinski and Scarborough made the blackmail allegations in an article jointly written for the Washington Post.
"This year, top White House staff members warned that the National Enquirer was planning to publish a negative article about us unless we begged the president to have the story spiked," they wrote.
"We ignored their desperate pleas."
Trump denied the pair's blackmail claims in a tweet sent out hours ago.
"Watched low rated @Morning_Joe for first time in long time. FAKE NEWS. He called me to stop a National Enquirer article. I said no! Bad show," Trump tweeted.
Scarborough issued a quick reply.
"Yet another lie. I have texts from your top aides and phone records. Also, those records show I haven't spoken with you in many months," Scarborough tweeted.
"Why do you keep lying about things that are so easily disproven? What is wrong with you?"
The National Enquirer, a tabloid newspaper known for its lurid content, denied involvement in any discussions between the White House and the MSNBC hosts.
"At no time did we threaten either Joe or Mika or their children in connection with our reporting on the story," the vice-president of the Enquirer's publisher said.
The pair, who are engaged to be married, also denied Trump's claims that Brzezinski was "bleeding badly from a face-lift" when she visited Mar-a-Lago in December.
"Putting aside Mr. Trump's never-ending obsession with women's blood, Mika and her face were perfectly intact, as pictures from that night reveal," Scarborough and Brzezinski wrote.
"And though it is no one's business, the president's petulant personal attack against yet another woman's looks compels us to report that Mika has never had a face-lift.
"If she had, it would be evident to anyone watching 'Morning Joe' on their high-definition TV."
Brzezinski and Scarborough were scheduled to go on vacation yesterday, but appeared on their show to address Trump's tweets.
"He appears to have a fragile, impetuous, childlike ego that we have seen over and over again — especially with women. He can't take it," Brzezinski said.
Scarborough, a former Republican congressman, has been a vocal Trump critic for much of his presidency.
He and Brzezinski were two of about 40 people Trump followed on Twitter, but the president unfollowed them recently.
Trump attacked Scarborough and Brzezinski on Twitter on Thursday morning, shortly after the pair mocked the fake Time magazine cover hanging on the walls of several of his golf clubs.
"I heard poorly rated Morning Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore)," he tweeted.
"Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!"
Trump's tweets were roundly criticised by politicians from both parties, with Republican senators Ben Sasse, Lisa Murkowsi, James Lankford and Susan Collins all slamming the president's attack.

Beyond Pilgrimage
Philip Harland has produced an exceptionally interesting and theoretically astute collection of essays, based on seminars of the Canadian Society of Biblical Studies and thoroughly in dialogue with new work like Jaś Elsner and Ian Rutherford's Seeing the Gods (although too late for some of the participants to engage Catherine Heszer's new Jewish Travel in Antiquity).[1] In some ways the volume follows new questions in the area of New Testament studies about itinerancy and cult migration; and yet only two of the papers in the volume address New Testament materials. The collection is far more eclectic, including discussions of Mesopotamian mythology, Nabataean ritual, and Tacitus's interpretations of barbarian gods.
After a competently thematic introduction by Harland, Steven Muir asks how, in a world in which identity and religion were primarily localized, one could orient oneself ritually while on the road (“Religion on the Road in Ancient Greece and Rome”). He proposes that travelers' “linkage” to their natal religious landscapes could be achieved through both “mirroring”--recognizing similar structures in alien landscapes--and “anchoring”--recognizing a reference point or center back in the natal landscape to which one could return. Although the terminology might be improved, Muir's scheme makes an original contribution, and he illustrates it with such clever examples as herms and roadside shrines, portable shrines, and omens that the traveler might encounter or invoke as an indication of a god's presence. Susan Haber (“Going Up to Jerusalem: Pilgrimage, Purity, and the Historical Jesus”) draws on the gospel accounts to examine pilgrimage to Jerusalem in the early first century CE, including the routes, intermediary stops, and purification practices involved. Wayne O. McCready (“Pilgrimage, Place, and Meaning Making by Jews in Greco-Roman Egypt”) draws on a concept of “place” introduced by Edward Casey to develop a thematic approach to Egyptian Jews' pilgrimage around and beyond Egypt, especially Elephantine and Jerusalem. While building on such exhaustive studies as that of Allen Kerkeslager, McCready offers an intriguing social/spatial scheme for comparing various types of travel.[2] One might have wished the author had taken his scheme a step further to accommodate the kinds of local shrines and even shared shrines that would naturally have characterized Jewish life in Egyptian local landscapes before 117 CE. Karljürgen G. Feuerherm's essay on gods' “travels” depicted in Mesopotamian ritual texts avoids the kind of thematic experiments that make Muir's and McCready's chapters so provocative. While a comparative approach to ancient festival processions and their mythological librettos would have brought the topic of travel into a new and helpful dimension, Feuerherm instead focuses on myth/ritual structures in a culture and period somewhat apart from the other essays in the volume (“Have Horn, Will Travel: The Journeys of Mesopotamian Deities”).
Three papers address the travels of particular charismatic individuals of the Greco-Roman period. Ian W. Scott (“The Divine Wanderer: Travel and Divinization in Late Antiquity”) asks how integral travel claims and narratives were to the aretalogies of heroes and philosophers, focusing on the stories of Apollonius of Tyana, Pythagoras, Alexander of Abonoteichos, and Peregrinus. Rejecting the paradigm of the “itinerant apostle” (as framed elsewhere by Richard Reitzenstein), Scott shows that these characters' travels all involve some orientation to places and centers. Some integration of Muir's ideas about “anchoring” might have contributed to this larger point; but more importantly, does Scott's question somehow wrongly put the emphasis on the relationship to place instead of on a literary form that embraces the travelogue? One thinks of the Lukan and apocryphal Acts that do not so much imagine their heroes as itinerant as offer a parade of “Others”--sometimes quite monstrous--among whom the hero must prove himself. It is the travelogue or “odyssey” that governs this depiction of the apostle rather than his placelessness. Philip Harland himself addresses the famous Thessalos romance, a tale of an inquisitive Roman youth's journey to the temples of Egyptian Thebes to find enlightenment and magical wisdom, all prefacing a practical herbology (“Journeys in Pursuit of Divine Wisdom: Thessalos and Other Seekers”). Published in a critical edition by André-Jean Festugière in 1939, the Thessalos text has been discussed in some detail by Jonathan Z. Smith, Garth Fowden, this author, and now Ian Moyer.[3] Harland includes a new Greek text and, placing Thessalos--whose expectations of Thebes provide the essential background to what he finds there--in comparison with spiritual travelers in Lucian's stories, he shows that Roman myths of Egypt made journeys there a unique form of sacred travel. Ryan S. Schellenberg contrasts the intrepid traveller Paul in Acts to the more anxious one in the letters (“‘Danger in the wilderness, danger at sea': Paul and the Perils of Travel”). While most scholarship tends to imagine Paul as Luke portrayed him, Schellenberg makes a convincing case that the apostle was no Indiana Jones and in fact disliked travel. James B. Rives's essay on Tacitus's representation of a particular German tribe and its gods (“Roman Translation: Tacitus and Ethnographic Interpretation”) contributes less to the conceptualization of travel than to the larger understanding of how Romans understood others' religions and gods. “The process of interpretatio [Romana],” he argues, “was simply a specific case of the more general problem of correctly identifying a superhuman power” (p. 180).
In one of the truly original contributions to this volume, Jack N. Lightstone (“Migration and the Emergence of Greco-Roman Diaspora Judaism”) proposes that such cultural institutions as hellenistic urbanism, festival observance, the idealization of temple symbols, and the Septuagint itself together allowed diaspora Judaism to attain a consistency across many lands, which was then--contrary to past models of the exportation of rabbinic influence--reintroduced to Palestine after the temple's destruction. Jewish travel, attested in early rabbinic and other literary sources, provided the major impetus to the consolidation of a diaspora-inspired Judaism in the second and third centuries. This is an innovative approach to the reconstruction of Jewish life in late antique Palestine, and one awaits further development and discussion of the thesis.
Harland is to be commended for including an essay on nomads in a volume on travel and religion, and Michele Murray's review of Nabataean religion (“Religion and the Nomadic Lifestyle: The Nabateans”) certainly asks the most interesting questions about the integration of mobility into religious practice and symbolism. Nabataean religious artifacts show a distinctive (generally aniconic) iconography of baetyls, and literary sources describe their use of circumambulation, a kind of “ritual travel” in Murray's view. The final contribution addresses Christian travel by way of the Oxyrhynchus papyri (“Christians on the Move in Late Antique Oxyrhynchus”). Lincoln H. Blumell finds that almost all the mentions of travel in this corpus had secular purposes rather than, e.g., pilgrimage. But one wonders, in this case, what status to attribute to this single representation of Christian documents. One of the most famous early Christian letters regards the journey (or transport, if a corpse) out to the Kharga oasis of an anonymous city-woman and her reception among the mortuary workers there (P. Grenfell 73, late third century), certainly a case of travel. Monastic writings (like the Historia monachorum in Aegypto) are replete with stories of inter-hermitage visits, such that we might well imagine travel--to monks, at least--to have served as a virtual myth of Christian literary culture in late antique Egypt. If Blumell's selection is not a rarefied sample but shows this myth to be entirely idealized, then it might have helped to underscore its implications. The stational procession led by a bishop around the shrines of Oxyrhynchus in the mid-sixth century (P. Oxy. XI.1357, re-edited by Arietta Papaconstantinou and overlooked by Blumell), offers an even more interesting image of “travel” as a component of the Christian religious (and performative) imagination in late antiquity.[4] One of the contributions of Harland and most of the others is to provoke new ways of thinking of “travel,” and Blumell could have offered more on the subject of late antique Christianity, if only to show the absence of the literary themes in ordinary letters.
All in all, Harland has assembled a rich, lucid, and thought-provoking book of essays, the kind that can be recommended for general perusal rather than for a few isolated essays. (Indeed, the absence of an index requires the reader tackle the essays in entirety rather than for their brief coverage of one topic or another). Travel and Religion in Antiquity is more than an essential resource for graduate and good undergraduate libraries. Indeed, a paperback edition would make an invaluable addition to an upper-level or graduate course on travel and pilgrimage.

Normally I wouldn't devote two blog posts to one person's NCAA tournament bracket, but Alex Ovechkin's bracket was not normal.
This actually reminds me, I'm pretty sure back in 2007 I got Alex Ovechkin to fill out the first NCAA tournament bracket of his life for The Washington Post. I think there's video of that somewhere, too. But that was two weeks after my daughter was born, so it's equally possible that this was a dream, or that a Caps PR person pretended to be Ovechkin in front of me, or that I took all the brackets I gathered that year and later stuffed them into a diaper storage unit.
Anyhow, you already know that Ovechkin picked Virginia to win the national championship this season, but here are some other of his observations I wanted to highlight.
On New Mexico vs. Stanford: “Uh, Burritos or Stanford? Burrito most hard-working guys, in, like the whole world.”
On George Washington: “Washington?”
On Michigan State-Delaware: “Michigan State-Detroit, right?”
On UNC-Providence: “Well, Maria [Kirilenko] gonna have a tournament in North Carolina, so let's do this one.”
On Iowa State-NC Central: “Lowa State?”
On Syracuse vs. Kansas: “Sasha, S. And Sergey too.”
On San Diego State vs. New Mexico State: “San Diego-New Mexico? Again Mexicans? So let's do San Diego then.”
Meanwhile, John Wall also did a bracket on video, also for Monumental Network. His Final Four includes Florida, Michigan State, Oregon and Wichita State, which he has beating his beloved Kentucky in the second round.
“Our team's been up and down this season,” Wall says in the video. “They've got a great chance to make a run. But Wichita State's on a great roll and they know what kind of season they're trying to have. And I just think they have enough veterans and smart players to get by us. Don't tell anybody.”

A Florida maintenance worker got a grisly sight Tuesday – a large alligator with a human body in its mouth.
The worker called police in Lakeland, in central Florida, to report that he had seen an alligator with human body parts in its mouth, Tampa television station WFLA reported.
Large gator seen with human body in its mouth in Lakeland https://t.co/VCXVvIjqMN — WFLA NEWS (@WFLA) June 7, 2016
Officers responded to the scene and confirmed that the human remains were from an unidentified male. The alligator released the body from its mouth, but managed to escape back into Lake Hunter.
A state alligator trapper responded to the scene at about 3 p.m. to help catch the animal.
As of 3:30 p.m., Lakeland police were working to keep the alligator away from the body so they could remove it from the water. It's not yet clear if the alligator killed the man; an autopsy will be done to determine his cause of death.
The person's identity is not known.
The condition of body indicated it had likely been in the water at least a day, a Lakeland Police Department sergeant told the local newspaper, the Ledger.
Last month, Donald Trump campaign adviser and Baptist preacher Ramiro Peña appeared on “The Jim Bakker Show” to discuss his work with the GOP presidential nominee, whom Peña sees as God's candidate in the race.
Bakker kicked things off by warning that President Obama wants to “federalize the local police,” which Peña said “was too much of a reflection of Nazi Germany and the takeover, federalizing everything, it's just too spooky and it's just wrongheaded all the way around.”
The conversation then turned to floating debunked conspiracy theories about George Soros fomenting race riots in order to bring America down, which prompted Peña to declare that Trump could be the leader who saves America from destruction.
Peña likened Trump to Cyrus the Great, the Persian king revered for liberating the Jews, saying that regardless of Trump's personal faith, “the Lord can choose a person and use a person whether he knows him or not.”
Despite Trump's record in the gambling business, Peña explained, the GOP nominee is clearly God's candidate: “If God was to choose Donald Trump to raise up and he's the one He wants to use, then who am I to say no?”
Macro photography is the art of taking close-up pictures that reveal details which can't be seen with the naked eye. For example, while we can see the fly on the wall, our eyes aren't equipped to make out the fine details of the hairs on it's face. This is where macro photography comes in. It gives us a glimpse into the world of the very small, which goes largely unnoticed by us as we hurriedly shuffle through our day.
In this edition of our Monday Inspiration series we present 25 beautiful examples of macro photography. A round-up of some truly revealing and inspiring macro photographs which are sure to have you marveling at the world around you. You may check out the links at the bottom of this post for further resources on the subject of macro photography.

It would happen at least twice a day: I'd be wiping the counter at the coffee shop, pulling espresso shots, making new drip coffee—and I'd feel it. It was always a different woman, but always the same scene: a woman in her mid-30s to mid-60s, hovering over the glass pastry case, staring at the brownies. I'd head over to help her, wiping my hands on my apron.
“Can I getcha something?”
I could predict where we were going with my eyes closed.
“Oh. Well. No,” the woman would say quickly.
“OK.” I'd turn around, put cookies on a plate, put the plate into the pastry case.
“Well…”
I was waiting for it. Here it came.
She'd lean over the counter and say, “Those raspberry brownies sure look good.”
“They're delicious,” I'd say.
“They look delicious.”
“Yes.”
“And fat-free, too, right? Hahaha.”
“Ha.”
“You know, I have been good,” she'd say, with a faintly creepy, conspiratorial we're-just-two-girls-in-this-together-right-honey tone.
“Mm-hm,” I'd reply.
“You know, I could maybe split a brownie, they're really too big for one person, don't you think? Maybe I'll just have half.”
“We don't sell half-pastries.”
“You don't? Really? Seems like you could do brisk business with, y'know, women—hahahaha!—who just want a little bite. It's so big, really, I'm not sure I could eat that much. Hmm. All right. I mean, I'm gonna be kicking myself for this later, but sometimes a girl just needs a snack, you know what I mean?”
And there would be a line backing up out the door of the coffee shop and she'd still be dithering and I'd want to like to rip my hair out and scream “JUST EAT THE FUCKING BROWNIE OMG YOU DON'T NEED MY PERMISSION AND YOU DON'T NEED TO FEEL GUILTY ABOUT WANTING SOMETHING HOLY SHIT.”
I mean, if you feel guilty about just eating a brownie that you want, what else in your life do you want you to're not expressing?
Aghhhhhhh.
Girls and women of the world, could we stop apologizing for wanting and eating food? Because this is one of the most ridiculous things that we do collectively as lady-people, and not only does it annoy the shit out of me personally, but it is also INCREDIBLY SAD. Could we stop feeling “guilty” for wanting an effing brownie? Or a plate of fries? Could we stop actively seeking permission from our friends to go ahead and “be bad” and order the cheesecake? Could we all just go ahead and order whatever it is that we feel like eating, instead of saying, “Oh, I feel like a pig, you guys are just getting salads”?
Because—now I know this will come as a shock—WOMEN EAT. We get hungry. We get hungry for pizzas and Double Stuf Oreos and nachos and ice cream and giant French-toast breakfasts, and you know what? WE DON'T NEED TO FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT.
Here I am making a vast and sweeping gender stereotype, but do you ever, ever hear dudes say “I just want a little bite” or “This is so bad, you guys, but I totally ate a whole pint of Ben & Jerry's last night”? No! Because it's OK for men to eat! Men get hongray! Men need frozen dinners called “Hungry-Man”! Men need Manwich! Boys are allowed to grow into men, but “attractive” women in our culture are expected to stay at pretty much an eternal pre-adolescent weight. What's society's current ideal man look like? Fit. Big muscles. What's society's current ideal woman look like? Thin. Really thin. No hips. No belly. Hairless except for the head. Basically a 10-year-old girl with boobs added for sex appeal.
You see it everywhere—every café, every restaurant, every kitchen across the country. Women bargaining with waiters and friends about whether or not they should get a side salad or fries with their entrée. Women making demeaning jokes to one another about their desire for food, like “Once on the lips, forever on the hips” and “Well, it's midnight, so technically your body doesn't know whether it's today or tomorrow, so the calories zero themselves out, hahaha” and women bonding with one another over their shared guilt! You're being bad and getting the chocolate cake? Ooh, now that you're doing it, let's both be really bad, and I'll order the key lime pie and we won't tell a soul, will we? It's just us girls!
Why are we apologizing for wanting food? What the hell? BODIES NEED FOOD. WE DIE WITHOUT IT. Food tastes good! And we're programmed to crave it! Sure, some food is healthier than other food, but what is up with punishing ourselves for wanting pickle chips? Why is it acceptable—nay! encouraged!—in our culture for women to feel guilty and publicly “admit” our guilt for wanting to eat a cookie? Why are we rationalizing our “bad behavior”—you know, our EATING—with statements like “I've been really good lately” or “I'm gonna need to walk this off later”?
It makes me insane.
I want this to end.
I want women to allow themselves to want food. I want women to be hungry and ask for what they want to eat without apologizing. I want women to stop looking for permission from others before they eat something that is not a carrot or spinach. I want my friends to get the chili fries if they want the chili fries, and not say something like, “It all goes straight to my ____” (hips, thighs, butt, etc.). I want to see a girl sink her teeth into a huge cheeseburger and fries and not cut the burger in half to save some for later. I want my mother to allow herself more than one small square of dark chocolate per day. I want women to take pleasure in food, without punishing ourselves for wanting it.
Hear me, womenfolk: I want all of us, everywhere, to stop apologizing, stop rationalizing our behavior, and just eat the damn brownie already. ♦
Nearly six months after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed to make the 2015 federal election the last to take place under the first-past-the-post formula, his government has finally managed to take its first step down the road to electoral reform.
And it's all (or, at least, partly) thanks to a well-timed push from the New Democrats.
The government has dropped its bid to give its own members majority control over the special committee that will be tasked with coming up with recommendations on alternative voting methods.
Instead, Liberal MPs will throw their support behind NDP MP Nathan Cullen's counter-proposal to divvy up the seats around the committee table based on the share of the vote parties received in the last election.
That works out to five Liberals, three Conservatives, two New Democrats and one each for the Bloc Quebecois and the Green Party's Elizabeth May, all of whom will have full voting rights.
That means the government will have to garner the support of at least one other party to win a vote at the committee table.
Democratic Institutions Minister Maryam Monsef announced the decision to back the NDP motion on Thursday morning, effectively guaranteeing it easy passage through the House. She also put forward several minor amendments, including one to set an Oct. 14 deadline for MPs to report back on their consultations with constituents (they had originally proposed an Oct. 1 deadline).
As sponsor, Cullen had to agree to accept the proposed changes, which he did. In fact, he told the House, he “welcomed” the minister's suggested tweaks.
Speaking with reporters outside the House, Monsef said that her priority is — and has always been — to get the committee up and running.
“It's time for them to get out there, to hear from Canadians,” she pointed out.
“We know there's a lot of passion on this, we know there are a lot of good ideas out there, and the purpose of coming together with the parties across the aisle today was to demonstrate that cooperation in this place is possible. We intend to do politics differently, and this is us demonstrating that.”
Cullen called it a good first step.
“If the process is seen and is fair and trusted by Canadians, then it greatly improves the chances that the outcome will also be fair and trusted by Canadians,” he told reporters shortly after the announcement.
“The government has agreed with us today that no one party should have the power to unilaterally push through changes to our voting system.”
In fact, he said, “if the government continues to work in good faith, and if the committee is able to work collaboratively and collegially, we don't think a referendum is required.”
Three of the five parties that will be represented at committee are on side with the general concept of electoral reform, although opinions differ sharply on what should replace the current system.
Although neither the party nor the government has taken an official position, the Liberals are widely thought to be leaning towards a ranked or preferential ballot system, while the New Democrats and Green party have long pushed for full proportional representation.
Meanwhile, the Conservatives could find themselves in an unlikely and potentially politically awkward alliance with the Bloc Quebecois, currently the only other party at the table that shares the Conservative view on the need to hold a referendum.
Conservative democratic reform critic Scott Reid described the surprise compromise proposal as a “backroom deal” between the Liberals, the New Democrats and possibly the Green Party, although he admitted that he wasn't sure May was involved.
He made it very clear that Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition was not involved in any of the behind-the-curtains negotiations that led to the deal.
“I did not know the details …. until (Monsef) moved her amendment to the motion, which was literally directly before my speaking slot,” he noted.
“So if anybody's suffering from the illusion that there was broad consultation, there absolutely was not.”
He said his party will vote against the motion, as it makes no reference to a referendum, which the Conservatives have been adamant must be held on any proposed change.
“There's been this talk … that … as long as you have the support of one other party, you can move forward, and you don't therefore need to have a referendum,” he observed.
“This, of course, is absolute nonsense — (the) support of one other party, or indeed of every other party is not a replacement for the people. …It is not a replacement for a referendum on … something as fundamental as changing the way Canadians get to exercise their sacred franchise.”
That vote could happen as soon as tonight, although sources have suggested it will be deferred until next Tuesday. Either way, the special committee could be up and running before the Commons chamber shuts down for the summer.
As yet, there's no word on whether it would launch an initial round of consultations over the two-and-a-half month recess or put the process on hold until MPs return to Ottawa in September. The clock is also ticking down to Team Trudeau's self-imposed deadline of 18 months to bring forward a legislative proposal for electoral reform.
Correction
An earlier version of the story misstated the date parliamentarians would have to report back from their constituents.
In my opinion, life is all about simple pleasures; propping your feet on the dash while riding shotgun along a country road, tasting that first scoop of gelato in the summer, and taking your pants off before sitting down to a good, homestyle meal.
In case you didn't know, all of the above can be done (legally) in the company of others. Just hop in the car and drive 30 minutes north east of Toronto to Bare Oaks Family Naturist Park, and you can enjoy your eggs and toast with lots of sausage.
The Bare Bistro has been a treasured amenity at the naturist park since 2007. Like in the swimming pool, clubhouse, on the volleyball courts or campgrounds, clothing is not only absent in the Bistro's dining room, but it is generally not permitted.
"We're not clothing optional," Bare Oaks manager Karen Grant tells me. "When visitors come, they're expected to adhere to the dress code." The term "dress code" is perhaps a bit misleading then, since the dress code amounts to no clothing at all.
"Naturism as all about respect for one's self, and respect for the body," Grant continues. "You'll find that once people shed the inhibitions of clothing, there's nothing to hide behind anymore. This place is very social; our members are always smiling and holding out a hand to anyone who's new."
The Bare Bistro is not exactly a drop-in nude diner. "It's more so for people who are here at the park with their families for the day or camping out on the land." If you are planning on visiting, however, it's probably best to disrobe in the car. "Usually, our members are just itching to shed their clothes so they take them off right when they arrive."
The Bistro is open seven days a week in the summer serving lunch and dinner, and breakfast on weekends. Operated and managed by Liz Savel, it is currently on a scaled back schedule for the winter months ("we are a naturist park, after all," says Grant).
"It serves a lot of light fare; hot dogs, hamburgers, eggs for breakfast, that sort of thing. Liz has a great touch, you really feel like you're sitting down in someone's kitchen."
Liz generally handles the kitchen herself during the winter, but stocks up on volunteers and staff during the busy summer months. "I tell you," Grant continues, "her chicken parmesan sandwich is really something." The bistro is also fully licensed and serves beer, wine and frozen drinks--a good thing if you're new and feeling a little.. uh, shy.
"There's indoor seating and a deck, which can fit, oh, 60 to 100 people," Grant says. "You're nude anyway, so you're going to want to be outside."
The busiest times are Thursday through the weekend in the summertime. When things are fairly slow, Liz will make one evening entrĂŠe and post a sign at reception for everyone to see. "There's a great community here, and new people are always welcome," Grant says. "I can't tell you how good it feels to eat a summer meal with friends in your most natural state. Here, we work on our all-over tans."

January 28, 2015 Blizzard of 2015 to Continue in Eastern New England Tuesday
By By Brian Lada, Meteorologist January 28, 2015, 8:29:51 AM EST
An all-out blizzard continues to slam New England on Tuesday afternoon, bringing travel and daily activities in many communities to a standstill.
Flight cancellations are mounting and travel bans and state of emergencies have been issued due to the blizzard that will halt travel, cut power and endanger anyone who ventures out into the storm.
For the latest information on travel bans, flight cancellations and other impacts, continue to follow AccuWeather.com's live blog for updated reports throughout the storm.
Greatest Hazards for the Blizzard of 2015 1. Travel will be brought to a standstill from central Long Island to Boston and Portland, Maine 2. Motorists run the risk of becoming stranded 3. High chance of airports closing 4. Snow totals in excess of 2 feet expected from southeastern Maine to central Long Island 5. Additional snow will fall in New York City; Blizzard conditions will continue Boston to Saint John, Canada, Tuesday. 6. Snow drifts as high as 10 feet; roofs may collapse 7. Lengthy power outages 8. Wind gusts near hurricane force on Cape Cod 9. Coastal flooding from the north shore of Long Island northward 10. Power outages, snow-packed roads and school closures may last for days after the blizzard
This system rapidly strengthened from an Alberta Clipper into a major snowstorm on Monday before evolving into a blizzard across southern New England on Monday night.
The heavily populated zone of southeastern New England, will be brought to a standstill with impacts lingering well after the blizzard departs.
Snowfall Totals
This could turn out to be the biggest storm of the winter for many areas in the Northeast and could rank among the greatest snowstorms in some communities.
In Worcester, Massachusetts, the greatest snowstorm on record is 33 inches set during the late March and early April storm in 1997. As of 8:00 a.m. EST, Tuesday, Worcester had tied their fourth largest snowstorm of 25 inches set during February of 1893. During February of 2013, Worcester received 28.7 inches.
Snow totals will reach or exceed 2 feet across a large part of Long Island and southern and eastern New England. This includes Manchester, New Hampshire; the Boston area, Worcester, Massachusetts; Willimantic and Groton, Connecticut; Providence, Rhode Island; and Islip, New York.
During the height of the storm, snowfall rates could reach 4 inches per hour. It is during these extremely heavy snow bands that thunder could be heard.
Strong winds howling during the storm will cause severe blowing and drifting of the snow. Drifts on eastern Long Island and from Connecticut to southeastern Maine can average 5 to 8 feet. Drifts could even approach 10 feet from Providence to Boston. Roofs may fail under the weight of such drifts.
People using shovels to clear the snow should take their time and take frequent breaks while shoveling to reduce the risk of heart-related injuries and fatalities.
Greatest Impacts
Impacts from the powerful storm will be felt all across the Northeast and into portions of Canada, but the worst of the storm is expected to focus on the area from central Long Island to Boston and Portland, Maine.
The blizzard will unload heavy snow and winds howling past 35 mph. The combination of the snow and wind will dramatically lower visibility down to zero. Winds in southeastern Massachusetts can occasionally gust up to near hurricane force during the worst of the storm Tuesday.
Motorists traveling at the height of the storm run the risk of becoming stranded as roads rapidly become clogged and snow-packed and the dangerously low visibility.
"Anyone stranded will face life-threatening conditions unless they have an emergency survival kit. Rescuers may not be able to reach them," stated AccuWeather.com Chief Meteorologist Elliot Abrams.
AccuWeather RealFeel® Temperatures will be below zero during much of the storm in New England and eastern Long Island.

A Thousand of flights have been cancelled in the Northeast corridor alone. Travel delays associated with this storm will not be limited to the Northeast. Ripple-effect delays are possible elsewhere in the nation as aircraft and crews are displaced due to the storm.
Lengthy power outages may result due to the strong winds, especially in southeastern New England. The winds could also down large tree limbs, which would pose additional hazards to those attempting to navigate snow-covered roads and sidewalks.
These strong winds blowing off the ocean have and will continue to cause coastal flooding and beach erosion from in New England with the worst flooding into Tuesday evening.
"Luckily for area residents, Monday marks the first quarter of the solar cycle (half the moon is visible). This means that the difference between high and low tide will be minimal," stated AccuWeather.com Meteorologist Evan Duffey.
"Also, Jan. 21 was Perigee when the moon was closest to the Earth. If the storm had come five days earlier, the high tide would have been higher by a good margin. The combination of these factors will work against the storm somewhat to limit coastal flooding."
Conditions will improve by Wednesday as the blizzard departs, allowing crews to begin the cleanup process in the wake of the storm.
Even after the worst of the storm has passed, it could take days for power to be restored, air traffic to return to normal, roads to be fully geared and schools to get back in session.
"Lingering midwinter cold and additional rounds of snow will add to difficulties for cleanup and those without power after the Blizzard of 2015," stated AccuWeather.com Senior Meteorologist Alex Sosnowski.
The economical impact of the blizzard will also be fully assessed after the fact. While companies could suffer losses, the blizzard could actually benefit others.
For example, companies will be faced with extra expenses due to transit being shut down, power outages and goods not being able to be transferred. On the other hand, the blizzard will eventually be a boost for the ski industry and stores that sell generators or other storm-related supplies.

Report a Typo
The American twenty-cent piece is a coin struck from 1875 to 1878, but only for collectors in the final two years. Proposed by Nevada Senator John P. Jones, it proved a failure due to confusion with the quarter, to which it was close in both size and value.
In 1874, the newly elected Jones began pressing for a twenty-cent piece, which he stated would alleviate the shortage of small change in the Far West. The bill passed Congress, and mint director Henry Linderman ordered pattern coins struck. Linderman eventually decided on an obverse and reverse similar to that of other silver coins.
Although the coins have a smooth edge, rather than reeded as with other silver coins, the new piece was close to the size of, and immediately confused with, the quarter. Adding to the bewilderment, the obverse, or "heads", sides of both coins were almost identical. After the first year, in which over a million were minted, there was little demand, and the denomination was abolished in 1878. At least a third of the total mintage was later melted by the government. Numismatist Mark Benvenuto called the twenty-cent piece "a chapter of U.S. coinage history that closed almost before it began".
Inception and authorization [ edit ]
A twenty-cent piece had been proposed as early as 1791, and again in 1806, but had been rejected. The 1806 bill, introduced by Connecticut Senator Uriah Tracy, sought both a two-cent piece and a "double dime". It was opposed by mint director Robert Patterson, though his opposition was more to the two-cent piece, which Tracy proposed be struck in billon, low-grade silver that would be difficult to recover when melting the coins. The bill passed the Senate twice, in 1806 and 1807, but did not pass the House of Representatives. No twenty-cent piece was issued prior to the 1870s, but Americans were familiar with the denomination as the two reales piece struck in Spain, known as a "pistareen" in the United States, passed for twenty cents (its Spanish colonial equivalent passed for a quarter).
Several factors converged to make possible a twenty-cent piece in the 1870s. The first was a shortage of small change in the far West, where base-metal coins did not circulate. Government payments in silver and gold had been suspended during the economic chaos caused by the civil war—coins containing precious metal were hoarded except on the Pacific Coast, and did not pass at face value in trade. Although the base-metal nickel was not widely accepted in the far West, the silver half dime had been struck in increasing numbers at the San Francisco Mint until the silver coin, which did not circulate in the East, was abolished by Congress in 1873. A shortage of small change resulted, especially as half dimes were used in the jewelry trade; customers complained they could not get full change for an item costing ten cents for which they paid with a quarter. Prices in the West were sometimes in bits (12​1⁄ 2 cents, based on the old Spanish colonial real, although those pieces no longer circulated), adding to the change problem. Numismatist David Lange states that a shipment of nickels out West could have solved everything, but that they might not have been accepted due to the prejudice against money which did not contain precious metal.
A second factor was the anxiety of Congress to see more silver made into coin. This was due to pressure from mining and other interests. The Coinage Act of 1873 ended the practice of allowing silver producers to have their bullion struck into silver dollars and returned to them. Although producers had not deposited much silver in the years before 1873 due to high market prices, former mint director Henry Linderman foresaw that those prices would fall as mines became accessible due to the completion of the transcontinental railroad across the United States, and that the resultant coinage would inflate the currency. He quietly urged Congress to end the practice, which it did. Within a year, silver prices had dropped, and producers tried vainly to deposit bullion at the mints for conversion into legal tender. Mining interests sought other means of selling silver to the government.
The third was American interest in aligning its currency with the Latin Monetary Union and to bring its weights for coinage into the metric system. Several times in the 1860s and 1870s, the United States Mint struck pattern coins that were to be used if America joined, in some cases with the equivalent in foreign money struck as part of the design. The twenty-cent piece was to be equivalent to one French franc in that system, and if in proportion to the smaller silver coins being struck,[a] would weigh five grams, a fact which appealed to advocates of the metric system in Congress. Another purpose for a large issue of silver coins, regardless of denomination, was to retire the fractional currency—low-value paper money or "shinplasters". Congress passed legislation in 1875 and 1876 for large quantities of silver coins for this purpose.
The father of the twenty-cent piece was Nevada Senator John P. Jones. Part-owner of the Crown Point Mine, he had been elected to the Senate in 1873; on February 10, 1874, he introduced a bill to authorize a twenty-cent piece, one of his first legislative endeavors. In advocating for the proposal, he cited the lack of small change in the West. It was endorsed by mint director Linderman; according to numismatic historian Walter Breen, "other legislators went along with it, largely as a favor to Sen. Jones". The bill was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 3, 1875. Like other denominations of silver coin, the twenty-cent piece was made legal tender up to five dollars.
Preparation and design [ edit ]
Pattern reverse designating the denomination as a fifth of a dollar. The obverse is the Seated Liberty, dated 1875.
In anticipation of the approval of the legislation, Linderman had pattern coins prepared. In August 1874, Philadelphia Mint superintendent James Pollock sent him patterns with an obverse showing a seated Liberty by Philadelphia sculptor Joseph A. Bailly with a reverse by chief engraver William Barber. Pollock did not approve Bailly's proposal, deeming it too similar to the Seated Liberty design which was then on all domestic silver coinage, and so the new coin would too closely resemble the quarter. On March 31, 1875, after the enactment of Jones's bill, Pollock sent Linderman additional patterns, all by Barber, and even more on April 12. Pollock deprecated a reverse design with a shield, but Linderman liked it and stated that it would have been adopted but for the law requiring an eagle to appear on silver pieces larger than the dime. Linderman selected an obverse design near-identical to the other silver coinage (until 1916, the silver coins were given similar appearances). That design, by the late chief engraver, Christian Gobrecht, following a concept by Thomas Sully and Titian Peale, was first used in 1836 and by 1840 was on all denominations of silver coins then being struck. The right-facing eagle is near-identical to the one which Barber had rendered for the trade dollar, which had debuted in 1873. Linderman had realized that the difference in size between the new coin and quarter was small, and thought a scaled-down version of the trade dollar suitable for the twenty-cent piece; he got his way on the reverse. The eagle carries the arrows of war in its right, or dominant claw, and the olive branch of peace in the left, in heraldry preferring war over peace.
The "Liberty by the Seashore" pattern coin
Art historian Cornelius Vermeule described the twenty-cent piece's obverse as "a pleasing synthesis of traditional elements". He was less complimentary about the eagle on the reverse, calling it awkward and a fatter version of the eagle on 18th-century American coinage. Vermeule admired the pattern designs made by Barber, especially the "Liberty by the Seashore" motif, which the historian believes owes a debt to the British copper coins of that period depicting Britannia—Barber was an Englishman by birth. He deemed it appropriate that the ship that is visible is powered by steam.
Numismatist Yancey Rayburn, in his 1970 article, wrote that the twenty-cent piece is bare of much of the lettering common on US coins: neither "In God We Trust" nor "E Pluribus Unum" appears on it. At the time, "E Pluribus Unum" was required on American coins under the 1873 act; "In God We Trust" was included on different coins at the discretion of the secretary of the treasury. The mottos were excluded as the coin was considered too small to contain them. The act creating the twenty-cent piece did not dictate its design, but provided that the new coin was to be subject to the terms of the 1873 act. Rayburn also admired that the full denomination, "twenty cents", was spelled out; at that time the quarter and fifty-cent piece had the word "dollar" abbreviated as "dol."
Production, aftermath, and collecting [ edit ]
Reverse of a 1796 ten-dollar piece Cornelius Vermeule deemed the eagle on the twenty-cent piece a fatter version of the bird on this coin.
The design for the twenty-cent piece was approved on April 12, 1875. It was, however, immediately revised to better define the olive leaves at the right end of the branch (over the N and the T in "cents"); on the original design, the leaves overlapped with each other. An amended approval was given on April 15. Production began at Philadelphia on May 19, on June 1 at the Carson City Mint in Jones's home state of Nevada, and between June 1 and 17 at the San Francisco Mint. Only about 40,000 were struck at Philadelphia; the bulk was at the two Western mints with 133,290 minted at Carson City, and 1,155,000 at San Francisco. The price of silver had not dropped to the point where Congress was willing to authorize redemption of paper money with silver coin, and would not until April 1876, lowering the need to strike the pieces at Philadelphia. Additionally, the coin was principally intended for circulation in the West, another reason for a low mintage at Philadelphia. Mint officials had overestimated the need for the piece at San Francisco, where it saw some public acceptance and the large mintage satisfied the modest public demand until treasury officials ordered stocks melted in 1877.
Although the mint had given the twenty-cent piece a smooth rim, rather than the reeded one on the quarter, the two pieces were immediately confused. At 22 millimetres (0.87 in), the twenty-cent piece was only slightly smaller than the quarter at 24.3 millimetres (0.96 in), and the two pieces had near-identical obverses. Mistakes in change-making were widespread, and the twenty-cent piece quickly became extremely unpopular. In April 1876, when Congress began to allow the redemption of fractional currency with coin, the twenty-cent piece was listed as among the denominations that could be exchanged for the low-denomination paper. Nevertheless, in July, legislation was introduced to abolish the twenty-cent piece. Although the bill did not pass immediately, according to numismatist Vernon Brown in his article on the piece, the pendency of the bill convinced the mint that there was no point in striking further twenty-cent pieces. The mintage for 1876 was low (coining took place at Philadelphia and Carson City), and only proof specimens were coined in 1877 and 1878, at Philadelphia. Most of the 1876 Philadelphia mintage were sold as souvenirs at the Centennial Exposition.
In March 1877, Linderman authorized the melting of 12,359 twenty-cent pieces at Carson City. This included almost the entire mintage from 1876 (about 10,000) and created one of the great American numismatic rarities, the 1876-CC twenty-cent piece. Fewer than two dozen are known; one sold at auction for $564,000 in 2013, making it the record-holder for the denomination. In her 2003 article, numismatist Michele Orzano suggests that the few survivors were souvenirs obtained by visitors to the mint.
Congress abolished the twenty-cent piece on May 2, 1878. The previous day, Linderman had ordered the mints to melt down twenty-cent pieces on hand, for recoinage into other denominations. By then, forces for silver coinage had been victorious in passing the Bland–Allison Act, requiring the government to purchase large quantities of silver bullion, and strike it into dollars. The piece continued to circulate in the West for a few years, but by 1890 was rarely seen. Of the 1,351,540 twenty-cent pieces minted for circulation, over a third were melted by the government between 1895 and 1954, most heavily in 1933. The least expensive twenty-cent piece, according to the 2014 edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins (the Red Book), is the 1875-S, listed at $110 in good-4 condition. According to commentary in the Red Book, the twenty-cent piece failed because "the public was confused over the coin's similarity to the quarter dollar, which was better established as a foundation of American commerce", that fractional currency satisfied the need for small change in the East, and because "the twenty-cent piece was essentially just a substitute for two dimes".

(CNN) Rep. John Conyers, who is under fire for accusations of sexual harassment, is in the hospital Thursday, an aide to Conyers told reporters.
Political consultant Sam Riddle said Conyers was hospitalized due to stress, according to CNN affiliate WDIV.
"I just spoke with Monica Conyers on the phone and we want you to know that the congressman is resting comfortably in an area hospital. He's doing OK, as well as he can be expected for a gentleman that's approaching 90 years of age," Riddle said. "The congressman's health is not what it should be and a lot of that is directly attributable to this media assault."
A separate aide to Conyers confirmed to CNN that the Michigan Democrat was in the hospital. Neither was able to give additional details about Conyers' condition or where he was, though Conyers was in his home district at the time.
Conyers, 88, is the longest currently serving member of the US House of Representatives.

In extraordinary CCTV footage released by Canterbury police, the robber shakes a sports bag in Ahmed's face with one hand and points a pistol at him with the other.
WELLINGTON: A New Zealand kebab shop owner who ignored a pistol-wielding, would-be robber and continued to serve his customers has insisted "I'm not a hero" after footage of his actions went viral.
Said Ahmed said he decided to call the bluff of a robber wearing a black hoodie and face mask who burst into the Egyptian Kebab House in Christchurch late in the evening.

In extraordinary CCTV footage released by Canterbury police, the robber shakes a sports bag in Ahmed's face with one hand and points a pistol at him with the other.
Instead of filling the bag with cash, Ahmed continues to pack the souvlaki he was working on and turns his back on the gunman to pick up some plastic cutlery and a napkin. He then calmly reaches around the robber to hand the meal to a customer, who accepts it and warily backs away.
As Ahmed walks off to the kitchen, the gunman stands at the counter for a few seconds, not knowing what to do, then takes his bag and shuffles off somewhat sheepishly.

Footage of the May 28 incident has been viewed almost 140,000 times, with commentators labelling Ahmed "the chillest chip shop operator ever".
He said the robber demanded money but his first thought was serving his customer and his reaction wrong-footed the gunman.
"He didn't scare me... he was surprised from my reaction," he told Fairfax New Zealand. "I was sure he would not shoot me. He came to rob me, not to kill me."
Ahmed, who migrated to New Zealand from Egypt 20 years ago, said it was the first incident of its kind in the 15 years he has owned the kebab shop.
"When he had gone my heart was beating hard," he told the New Zealand Herald, saying he "thanks God" for guiding him during the robbery. The 55-year-old said he now closed his shop earlier and advised his children "be a little brave - life can change in a few seconds".
Police said they were still seeking the gunman.

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is planning a ₹ 21,000 crore package of state aid for India's solar panel manufacturing industry, according to two officials.
The so-called Prayas initiative, short for “Pradhan Mantri Yojana for Augmenting Solar Manufacturing," a central-government plan designed to lift India's installed photovoltaic capacity as well as to create an export industry, according to two senior government officials with direct knowledge of the plan. They asked not to be identified because the policy isn't yet public.
Modi wants to raise renewable capacity to 175 gigawatts by 2022 from 45 gigawatts at present. In addition to meeting its own energy targets, which Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates may cost $200 billion, India wants to emulate industrial developments in neighbouring China, where solar manufacturers have created a world-leading export industry.
The Prayas programme, part of Modi's ‘Make in India' campaign, is intended to create 5 gigawatts of photovoltaic manufacturing capacity from 2019 and build 20 gigawatts of projects in the country by 2026, according to the officials. The policy, which is being developed by the ministry in charge of renewable energy and industrial policy, along with the Niti Aayog government research group, will be presented to the finance ministry within a month before going to the cabinet for final approval, they said.
Catching China
Last month power minister Piyush Goyal said in Mumbai that a policy to encourage domestic manufacturing of solar equipment is in works. When reached on phone, the spokesman for the power and renewable energy ministries declined to comment.
India has become one of the biggest clients of Chinese photovoltaic manufacturers and in the absence of its own domestic capacity, that reliance could potentially grow. In the first six months of 2016, India imported 18% of China's production worth $1.1 billion, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
India's policy proposal, expected to create thousands of jobs, is also in response to the industry's demand for help to the country's solar manufacturers, one official said, adding that multiple tenders of a few hundred megawatts each would be issued for the manufacture of everything from wafers to modules.
Price advantage?
The government could offer about ₹ 90 lakh a megawatt for manufacturing tenders and ₹ 50 lakh a megawatt for local deployment, according to one of the officials, who said the numbers are subject to change.
The plan “might give a price advantage" if the manufacturing-hub logistics are “well planned," according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst Jenny Chase. Money alone isn't a sufficient incentive for companies to set up the most high-tech automated factories needed to compete, she said.
Japan's SoftBank Group Corp. told Bloomberg News last month it's considering a manufacturing joint venture in India that could produce the solar panels needed to meet Modi's energy targets.
“To build large-scale manufacturing efficiency matching Chinese economics of scale will require government support," Manoj Kohli, executive chairman of SB Energy said in an interview in New Delhi. He described Indian support policies in an “evolution stage." Bloomberg
Canada Goose is trying to "bully" Sears Canada Inc. and other retailers through litigation, Sears is alleging in court documents as it hits back at a trademark infringement lawsuit.
The parka maker's real motive is to curtail the sales of lower-priced winter jackets so Canada Goose can keep selling its products "at a huge markup," Sears alleges.
Canada Goose alleges in a lawsuit filed late last year that Sears is selling knock-offs of its highly distinctive coats.

The department store has now filed its statement of defence in Federal Court and is taking direct aim not just at this particular lawsuit, but what the retailer calls Canada Goose's "campaign of intimidation."
Canada Goose is trying to claim the exclusive right to sell any winter coat with a fur collar "of any sort" or with a circular logo on its sleeve, Sears alleges in its statement of defence.
"Canada Goose is simply attempting to bully Sears and others through demands, unfounded litigation, statements in the press and the like, into ceasing activities that Canada Goose knows do not cause confusion or any harm to it," Sears alleges.
"The real purpose of Canada Goose's campaign of intimidation is to attempt to prevent or lessen sales in the marketplace of less expensive winter jackets ... to preserve its temporary ability to sell its garments at a huge markup to the public."
Neither Sears' nor Canada Goose's allegations have been proven in court.
Canada Goose alleges that Sears is intentionally trying to mislead consumers into believing they're buying a "lower-end" Canada Goose jacket, the parka maker alleges in its lawsuit.
In its statement of defence, Sears says no consumer could confuse a Canada Goose jacket with Sears' Alpinetek coats. Sears has held a trademark for the Alpinetek logo since 1998, Sears wrote in its defence.

Canada Goose has no exclusive rights to a circular logo positioned on the upper sleeve of a winter jacket, Sears alleges, saying it is commonplace for coats.
Canada Goose's rights, if any, are to the name and mark Canada Goose and not in such features as a circular logo and fur trim, Sears alleges.
Canada Goose has previously sued International Clothiers Inc., alleging it intentionally designed a logo and positioned it on jackets to mimic the Canada Goose Arctic Program design trademark.
The lawsuit was later settled on undisclosed terms.
Canada Goose bills itself in the lawsuit as a "Canadian success story," as its jackets have become very well-known in Canada and abroad.
The collective global roar of disapproval that greeted North Korea's launch of its satellite Kwangmyongsong-4 is a familiar sound by now. The universal fury at Pyongyang's actions was similar to that which greeted its purported recent underground test of a hydrogen bomb.
As they did after that event, the US, South Korea, Russia, Japan and China (and many others) were forced into an uncomfortable diplomatic lockstep by their need to issue loud objections – though later statements on what might be done to censure North Korea were rather more uneven. And just as was the case with the size of the January 2016 test at Punggye-ri, the scale of the Kwangmyongsong-4 launch's technological achievement has already been questioned. South Korea's Yonhap agency was characteristically quick to suggest it had been a failure.
Business as usual, then. And as usual, the world is overlooking any context for the launch beyond the issue of nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles. As is generally the case when it comes to North Korea and technology, there's a glaring gap between what's actually going on in North Korea and the invective thrown back by its foes. Kwangmyongsong-4 is as much about national scientific and economic development as much as it is about geopolitical messaging.
In December 2012, North Korea launched Kwangmyongsong-3, which it described as an earth observation satellite designed to generate data to support North Korean agricultural planning (though it was also intended to broadcast the Song of Kim Il-Sung to the planet on a 470Mhz frequency). Unfortunately for Pyongyang, nothing was ever heard from it; both computer simulation and visual observation proved that whatever had been placed in orbit was spinning hopelessly out of control.
So far, North Korea has refrained from bragging about Kwangmyongsong-4's technical capacity, and has issued no claims as to its musicality. It is once again described as an “earth observation satellite” containing “measuring apparatuses and telecommunications apparatuses needed for observing the earth”.
But this time, according to analysis of its path and orbit, the object released by the final stage of the orbital vehicle appears to be under control; in fact, its orbit has even been described by respected Dutch satellite tracker Marco Langbroek as “consistent with a remote sensing role”.
Of course, nations around the world seem determined not to accept Kwangmyongsong-4 as anything other than yet another example of provocative weapons testing. They are keen to negate Pyongyang's assertions that this is indeed an exercise in the development of its capacity to explore space for peaceful ends.
Getting a grip
Such exploration and utilisation is of course entirely legal under the United Nation's 1967 Outer Space Treaty and the 1975 Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space – both of which North Korea acceded to in 2009.
Why indeed would it be so strange for Pyongyang to want to develop its capacity to launch vehicles into space, or to build functional earth observation devices? North Korea's conception of 2012's device as an element of projects focused on improving its agricultural capacity surely makes perfect sense given the historically haphazard nature of North Korean industrial planning.
If the satellite really does have remote sensing capacity, that could be a boon to North Korea's ability to manage its forests and fisheries, and could greatly improve the country's meteorological monitoring ability.
These are major domestic priorities. The Supreme Leader, Kim Jong-Un, quite unexpectedly and viciously denounced the country's weather forecasting service in 2014, and in 2015, his government put a lot of work into developing the fishing industry and improving flood prevention and forecasting (especially after recent floods in the important Rason Special Economic Zone).
And aside from the obvious potential practical benefits, external commentators have paid scant attention to Kwangmyongsong-4's place in North Korea's charismatic political calendar.
Fascinating vapour
Western commentators certainly made mention of the North Korean newspaper Rodong Sinmun's euphoric report of the launch, which marvelled at “the fascinating vapour of Juche satellite trailing in the clear and blue sky in spring of February on the threshold of the Day of the Shining Star”. But they failed to connect the commemorative dots.
February 16, the Day of the Shining Star, was Kim Jong-Il's birthday, what better posthumous gift could there be for the Dear Leader?
The outside world has also overlooked any connection with the impending Seventh Party Congress of the Korean Workers Party in May 2016, and the political and developmental theatrics that will accompany this year-long event.
Instead, the wider world is railing against Pyongyang using its typical themes of threat, fear and danger. The global gnashing of teeth shows us just how myopic and black-and-white the thinking on North Korea has become.
We live in a world where potentially dual-use technology is blasted above the stratosphere many times a year, and where the launch of astronauts such as the UK's new “hero” Major Tim Peake can be lauded as manifestations of national pluck. Even in the depths of the cold war, the Soviet Air Force's Yuri Gagarin was lionised in the West for his pioneering space voyage. And yet, for all that the domestic context for this launch is plain to see, we refuse to open our minds to the idea that Pyongyang's space ventures may be motivated by anything other than belligerence.
