Disability classifications
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.

Sarkar is a series of Indian political crime thriller films set in the world of Marathi politics and crime, co-produced and directed by Ram Gopal Varma. The first part Sarkar released in 2005, the second part Sarkar Raj in 2008, and the third installment Sarkar 3 in 2017.
Overview
Sarkar (2005)
Subhash Nagre (Amitabh Bachchan), known by their followers as Sarkar, lives in Mumbai. The opening scenes show a rape victim's father (Veerendra Saxena) approaching Sarkar for justice (which the corrupt law and order system has failed to deliver) which Sarkar promptly establishes by having the rapist beaten up by their henchmen. Their son, Vishnu (Kay Kay Menon), plays a sleazy producer who is more interested in the film actor Sapna (Nisha Kothari) than their wife Amrita (Rukhsar). Sarkar's other, more upright son, Shankar (Abhishek Bachchan), returns from the United States with their love Pooja (Katrina Kaif) after completing their education there. Pooja's doubts about Sarkar's image cause Shankar, who firmly believes in their father's righteousness, to break up with them later in the movie.
One day, a Dubai-based don, Rasheed (Zakir Hussain) tries to strike a deal with Sarkar; they promptly refuse on moral grounds and also forbids them from doing it himself. Rasheed tries to eliminate Sarkar's supremacy with the help of Selvar Mani (Kota Srinivasa Rao), Sarkar's former associate, Vishram Bhagat and Swami Virendra (Jeeva). Meanwhile, they trap Sarkar by assassinating a righteous, upright, Ahimsa political leader and an outspoken critic of Sarkar, Motilal Khurana (Anupam Kher). Everyone, including Vishnu believe that Sarkar is guilty but Shankar has deep faith in their father. Sarkar gets arrested. Shankar now takes over the position of Sarkar temporarily. On learning of a plot to murder their father in prison, they approach the police commissioner (Anant Jog) who mocks them and their father besides not providing protection. By the time they reach the prison and appropriate action is taken, the attempt on Sarkar's life is already made. Sarkar is later acquitted. They remain bedridden as Shankar takes on Sarkar's enemies.
Meanwhile, Selvar Mani, Swami, Vishram and Rasheed try to convince Vishnu to murder Sarkar. Vishnu was previously thrown out of Sarkar's house because they had murdered the actor who was having an affair with Sapna. Vishnu returns home pretending to have repented. When they approach Sarkar in the dark of the night with the intent of murdering him, Shankar foils their plan and later kills them (establishing justice by the way of their father). Shankar eliminates Rasheed, Vishram and Selvar Mani. They also succeed in making Swami their puppet. Shankar has also realised that Chief Minister Madan Rathore (Deepak Shirke) also has a part in the attempt to end Sarkar and their rule. This results in legal action against the Chief Minister. The closing scenes show people approaching Shankar for justice and their father apparently retired.
Sarkar Raj (2008)
The sequel is chronologically set two years after the first film. Anita Rajan (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan), CEO of an international electrical power firm based in London, holds a meeting with Mike Rajan (Victor Banerjee), their father and boss and Hassan Qazi, as a seemingly shady adviser and facilitator; regarding an ambitious proposal to set up a multimillion-dollar power plant in rural parts of the state of Maharashtra in India.
Qazi states that this project will be impossible due to possible political entanglements. When Anita asks them for a solution, Qazi states that enlisting the support of Subhash Nagre (Amitabh Bachchan) (commonly referred to by their title of Sarkar), who they describe as a criminal in the garb of a popular and influential political leader, might help their cause. The resulting socio-political drama forms the crux of the story.
Sarkar 3 (2017)
In 2009 Ram Gopal Verma stated that they had no plans finalised for the third instalment in the series and shelved Sarkar 3. However, in 2012 it was reported that the sequel would go ahead once again and currently is in the pre production stage where the script is being written. The film is expected to go on floors at the end of 2013, primarily with the same cast of Amitabh and Abhishek Bachchan although their character dies at the end of this film and also Aishwarya Rai is to be left out.
In August, 2016 director Ram Gopal Varma confirmed Sarkar 3. They told on their Twitter that Abhishek and Aishwarya will not be a part of the third installment.
Cast and characters
Crew
Production
The first film, Sarkar (2005), is often said to be a remake of The Godfather (1972).
Debutante Rajesh Shringarpore's character of Sanjay Somji in its sequel Sarkar Raj (2008) was also reportedly based on Raj Thackeray, the estranged nephew of political leader Bal Thackeray; thus furthering the general viewpoint that the series is based on Bal Thackeray and their family. Apparently Ram Gopal Verma had even shown Raj Thackeray rushes of the film to allay their fears of being wrongly portrayed.

The South Devon Railway (SDR) is a heritage railway from Totnes to Buckfastleigh in Devon. Mostly running alongside the River Dart, it was initially known as the Dart Valley Railway. The railway is now operated by the South Devon Railway Trust, a registered charity.
The railway's headquarters and museum are located at Buckfastleigh railway station.
History
A railway between Newton Abbot and Ashburton received Parliamentary approval and Royal Assent in 1848. However, with the economy in recession the scheme failed to find sufficient backing. After the Parliamentary approval of construction of the South Devon Railway Company (SDR) from Exeter to Plymouth, a new Buckfastleigh, Totnes and South Devon Railway scheme was proposed to make a junction with the SDR at Totnes and link it with Buckfastleigh, running alongside the River Dart. It opened as a broad gauge line through to on 1 May 1872 and was operated from the outset by the SDR (which became part of the Great Western Railway in 1876). The last passenger train ran on 3 November 1958 although freight traffic continued until 7 September 1962.
Preservation
Having secured GWR 4500 Class Small Prairie Tank No.4555 for £750 from BR, Patrick Whitehouse and fellow "Birmingham Railway Mafia" member Pat Garland were looking to secure a GWR style branch line on which to run the locomotive. Both had been involved in the world's first ever heritage railway at the Talyllyn Railway, and so were seeking a complete and in-place railway. In partnership with fellow Talyllyn veteran Bill Faulkner and other local business person, having originally focused on the already closed GWR Kingsbridge branch. With the track already being removed there, they then focused on the Buckfastleigh to Ashburton branch. Their business plan was to launch and operate a profitable summer-season tourist railway, focused on the many summer visitors who choose to holiday in South Devon.
Forming the Dart Valley Light Railway Company Ltd, it took ownership of the branch line in October 1965, and was granted a light railway order to operate in 1966. However, the Ministry for Transport insisted that the railway assist in improvements to the A38 road, and it was not until 1969 that an agreement was made to operate from Totnes to Buckfastleigh, with the section beyond to Ashburton and its unique remaining Brunel-style station lost to dual carriageway improvements to the A38 trunk road. The final severing of the line took place in 1971.
The first passenger train ran on 5 April 1969, with Dr Richard Beeching performing the official opening ceremony on 21 May 1969. Operated from the outset - as had the Talyllyn and the Ffestiniog Railway - as a commercial railway, in the first year the Dart Valley carried 60,000 passengers at a profit.
In 1971, the company was offered the opportunity to purchase from British Rail the freehold of the Kingswear Branch, running from Paignton to Kingswear, and hence by ferry to Dartmouth. To complete the purchase, in 1972 the original preservation company became the "Dart Valley Railway Company plc" (DVR), although it was not listed on the London Stock Exchange.
South Devon Railway Trust
In 1989, the DVR plc publicly announced that the Totnes to Buckfastleigh line was uneconomic, and had hence decided to find another operator or close it. In response, the volunteers who assisted in running the line proposed to take over operations. As the articles of association of the resident GWR 4900 Class No. 4920 Dumbleton Hall charity allowed it to operate a railway, the joint-team proposed using that charity as its commercial vehicle to take over the line. Renamed the "South Devon Railway Trust", the railway was renamed the South Devon Railway, and the volunteer supporting body renamed the South Devon Railway Association. The Trust took over the running of the line on 1 January 1991, with the first train running on 29 March 1991. The Trust subsequently bought the freehold of the line from DVR plc on 8 February 2010. The South Devon Railway was named the Heritage Railway of the Year in 2007.
Accidents and incidents
A child almost fell from a carriage on 22 June 2017 whilst the train was in motion between Totnes Riverside and Buckfastleigh. This was due to part of the floor in a toilet being missing following repairs to the carriage's brake system. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch investigated what it called a "dangerous occurrence". It released its report into the accident on 30 January 2018. The investigation concluded that the railway's Safety Management System at the time was inadequate, and that there were deficiencies in the system to ensure vehicles were fit for service. One recommendation was made. It was revealed that the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) had issued an improvement notice in July 2017 and that the notice was deemed to have been complied with in November 2017. The South Devon Railway was prosecuted by the ORR in May 2018 on a charge of failing to ensure people in its employ and passengers were not exposed to risk of harm. It pleaded guilty and was fined £40,000 with costs of £13,205 and a victim surcharge of £170.
Route
The line is 6 miles and 51 chains long (10.7 km). It stretches from to . is the only intermediate station on the line which is served by all trains; however, is a short distance to the east of Staverton and is served by occasional special trains. Just north of Staverton is a signal box known as Bishops Bridge where there is the only passing loop on the line.
For most of its route, the line runs to the east or north of the River Dart. This means that the river views are best seen to the left of the train when facing Buckfastleigh and to the right of the train when facing Totnes.
Services
Trains on the South Devon Railway operate daily from late March to the end of October. On most days, a single train set operates, providing four journeys a day in each direction. On busy days (most of the school holidays), two train sets operate, providing more journeys.
Filming location
The railway has been used as a filming location for period films and television programmes. It featured in early scenes of the BBC's 2015 mini-series And Then There Were None.
Rolling stock
The rolling stock preserved on the line include many examples of steam locomotives typical of the Great Western Railway types that would have once worked on it, such as GWR 1400 Class number 1420. There are also other types of steam locomotives and a number of diesel locomotives. As well as those used in service, there are a number that are undergoing overhaul or restoration, or are displayed in non-working condition. The most significant one of these is Tiny, a South Devon Railway 0-4-0VB shunting locomotive on display in the museum at Buckfastleigh station. This is the only original broad gauge locomotive still in existence in the United Kingdom.
There are a number of historic coaches in use, including two Great Western Railway "Super Saloons", some coaches once used in the Royal Train, and three auto coaches that were used on small branch lines such as this.
Signal Boxes
South Devon Railway Engineering
The railway has its own engineering workshops, run as South Devon Railway Engineering Ltd (SDRE), which restores locomotives and rolling stock for the South Devon Railway.
SDRE also undertakes external contracts. For example, it built the two stills at The Oxford Artisan Distillery, nicknamed "Nautilus" and "Nemo" after the submarine and its captain in the Jules Verne 1870 science fiction novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas. The stills were built in copper using a steampunk style.

Walid "Tatta" Atta (, ; born 28 August 1986) is an Ethiopian footballer who plays as a centre back for Hittarps IK.
Career
AIK
In January 2008, Atta joined Swedish top-division side AIK, but was immediately loaned back to Väsby. They made their first appearance for their new club on 10 April 2008 against GIF Sundsvall at Råsunda Stadium, playing the full game in defence. In the summer of 2010, Atta's situation at AIK came in doubt when they turned down a contract extension with the club. Together with their agent, they cut off the negotiations with AIK, and stated that they wanted to await bids from clubs outside of Sweden. This angered the AIK supporters, and in the 2–1 win against IF Brommapojkarna, parts of the crowd openly showed their disappointment. Some organized supporters demanded Atta to be disbanded from playing in AIK until they signed a new deal with the club. The club board followed the demands and stopped Atta from participate in AIK's Europa League qualification game against PFC Levski Sofia. In 2010, Atta was sold to Croatian First Division side NK Lokomotiva.
Dinamo Zagreb
After one season in Lokomotiva, they signed a 5-year contract with Croatian giants Dinamo Zagreb. However, their time at Dinamo was not prosperous, making no appearances apart from a friendly against GOŠK Gabela. In January 2012, the contract was terminated by mutual consent and Atta became a free agent.
Helsingborgs IF
Soon after becoming a free agent, Atta was signed by Allsvenskan side Helsingborgs IF. They have since become a regular in the starting eleven.
BK Häcken
On 6 March 2014 Atta signed with BK Häcken prior to start of the 2014 Allsvenskan campaign.
Hittarps IK
On 13 February 2019, Atta joined Hittarps IK.
International
In 2008, Atta also became a member of the Swedish U-21 team, making their debut in a friendly against Ukraine on 5 February 2008, in Alcanena, Portugal. They played a total of 3 matches for the Swedish U-21 team. In October 2013 they decided to represent Ethiopia at senior level. Atta was supposed to make their debut against Nigeria in the African play-offs for the World Cup in Brazil, but the needed papers did not arrive in time. They finally made their debut in a qualifiers match for the 2015 CAF against Mali in Addis Ababa. Ethiopia lost that match in Addis Ababa but won the second leg in Mali. Walid played in both these matches.

Bronc Burnett is the central character in a series of 27 football, baseball, and scouting novels for adolescent boys set in Sonora, New Mexico, written by Wilfred McCormick between 1948 and 1967. The series was published by G.P. Putnam's Sons (#1–11), by David McKay (#12–23), and by Bobbs-Merrill (#24–27). Grosset & Dunlap reissued the entire series with some changes in the order of the books, and with both dust jackets and full-color cover illustrations. Some titles were included in Grosset & Dunlap's "Famous Sports Stories" Collection.
In 2001, Mark Mravic wondered if Bronc's "hokey wholesomeness" was relevant in the new millennium and commented, "Each installment of the Burnett series offers a morality play about sports and life—coping with criticism, for instance, or learning humility in the face of success. Was America ever so innocent, baseball ever so pure? Archetypes people Bronc's world: their loyal sidekick, catcher Fat Crompton; Cap'n Al, the gruff but lovable coach—"solid as a granite boulder"—who imparts the wisdom of their eight years in the big leagues; the insufferable Fibate Jones, team scorekeeper and resident gadfly. This is a world in which baseball-hungry townsfolk build the high school stands by hand; in which sheriff Pole Drinkwater works behind the plate, immune to the "yip-yaps" heckling him; in which the good guys are lanky, broad-shouldered, nimble-footed, and the villains sport names like Slug Langenegger and Sluice Derrick."

The masked crimson tanager (Ramphocelus nigrogularis) is a species of bird in the family Thraupidae.
It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical swamps and subtropical or tropical moist shrubland.
The masked crimson tanager was first described by German naturalist Johann Baptist von Spix in 1825. Its species name is derived from the Latin words niger "black", and gularis "throated". It is one of nine species of brightly coloured tanagers of the genus Ramphocelus. Mitochondrial DNA evidence indicates its closest relative is the crimson-backed tanager (R. dimidiatus), and the two split around 800,000 years ago.
Measuring 18 to 19 cm (7–7.5 in) in length, the adult male has a black face, wings, mantle, belly and tail, and is a bright red elsewhere in its plumage. The bill has a silver sheen. The female resembles the male but has a brownish belly and duller plumage overall, while the juvenile is duller still. It resembles the vermilion tanager (Calochaetes coccineus) but the latter lives at higher altitudes.
The masked crimson tanager makes a high-pitched single note variously transcribed as tchlink or "tink", and a simple melody often sung at dawn.
The masked crimson tanager is found across Amazonia and is abundant. It prefers to dwell near bodies of water such as lakes, swamps or rivers, generally at altitudes below 600 m (2000 ft). Masked crimson tanagers move about in troops of 10 to 12 birds. The species can form mixed species flocks with the silver-beaked tanager (Ramphocelus carbo). It is frugivorous (fruit-eating).
Behavior
The masked crimson tanager has been speculated to engage in reverse sexual dominance behavior similar to their congener pair, the silver-beaked tanager. The masked crimson tanagers, who belong to the passerine bird order exhibit this behavior similar to that of their cousin. However, there is no observable evidence to support the hypothesis that the masked crimson tanager are among the rare and unexplained phenomenon of reverse sexual dominance. Under normal circumstances, passerine species of birds exemplify a default hierarchy of dominance wherein larger, heavier birds tend to dominate the smaller, lighter birds and males tend to dominate females. Between masked crimson tanagers and the silver-beaked tanager, individuals engage in a form of interference competition, also known as competition by resource defense, when partitioning resource-rich habitats. The masked crimson tanager prefer to inhabit sites close to or around oxbow lakes, a common geographical feature of their native Amazon biome. They demonstrate aggression while defending the more productive areas around the lakes, causing the silver-beaked tanager to occupy the riparian forest. The masked crimson tanagers are competitively superior and dominate most interspecies interactions with their cousin.
Breeding
The masked crimson tanager breeds in between the dry and wet seasons of the seasonal tropics that they occupy. This species of tanager participates in cooperative breeding, which involves the communal care and protection of the offspring. For the masked crimson tanager, as well as other lake-margin bird species, cooperative breeding may be favored due to high population density and scarcity of habitable space.
In neotropical forests, the masked crimson tanager congregates in mixed flocks much like those seen in flycatchers and vireos. The degree to which the masked crimson tanager forms mixed flocks correlates with the relative extent to which broad-leafed canopy make up the composition of the neotropical forest.
Feeding
Like most tanagers, masked crimson tanagers are mainly frugivorous, supplementing their fruit diets with small insects such as flying termites. Their insectivorous tendency is driven by the periodic cycle of the breeding of termites, which produce winged males and females when sexually active. These termites are richer in nutrients than normal wood termites and therefore it may become more ecologically sound for the masked crimson tanager to feed on these insects to supplement their existing diets.
Masked crimson tanagers may also feed on the nectar of flowers as part of their diet. They have not been observed opening flowers themselves, only feeding on nectar from flowers already been opened by some other species of bird or insect. They feed on flowers of Erythrina fusca plants without damaging them, while simultaneously contacting the anthers of the flowers with their heads, thus making them effective pollinators.

Belarus' Victoria Azarenka and Max Mirnyi defeated Great Britain's Laura Robson and Andy Murray in the final, 2–6, 6–3, [10–8] to win the gold medal in Mixed Doubles tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics. In the bronze medal match, the United States' Lisa Raymond and Mike Bryan defeated Germany's Sabine Lisicki and Christopher Kas, 6–3, 4–6, [10–4].
The tournament was held from 1 to 5 August on the grass courts of the England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London. This was the first time mixed doubles was included in the Olympic tennis programme since Paris in 1924, where Hazel Wightman and Richard Williams won gold. 32 players (16 pairs) from 13 nations competed.
Background
This was the fifth appearance of mixed doubles tennis. The event was first held in 1900 and would not be held again until 1912 (when both outdoor and indoor versions were held); it would then be held the next two Games in 1920 and 1924. Tennis was not a medal sport from 1928 to 1984, though there were demonstration events in 1968 (which included mixed doubles) and 1984 (which did not). Mixed doubles did not return with the rest of the tennis programme in 1988; instead, it was not until 2012 that mixed doubles returned to the programme, where it has been since.
Belarus's Max Mirnyi was a top doubles specialist with six Grand Slam titles but no Olympic medals, as the country had no other top level male doubles player and the mixed doubles had not been played at the Olympics since 1924. Victoria Azarenka was the world #1 women's singles player with strong experience in doubles. The pair had won the 2007 US Open – Mixed doubles together and were the top seeds coming into the return of the event at the 2012 Olympics. The other seeded teams were the two American pairs (with the Bryan brothers playing with Liezel Huber and Lisa Raymond) and Polish duo Agnieszka Radwańska and Marcin Matkowski.
Argentina, Australia, Belarus, the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, and Serbia each made their mixed doubles debut. Great Britain and Sweden each competed for the fourth time, matching the absent France for most appearances among nations.
Qualification
The main qualifying criteria were the ATP and WTA ranking lists as of 11 June 2012. The players entering were formally submitted by the International Tennis Federation. The ATP and WTA rankings were based on performances from the previous 52 weeks, and there were several tournaments in the two-month period between the time of the rankings being frozen for entry and the beginning of the tennis events at the Olympics. Players must have also made themselves available for two Fed/Davis Cup events from 2009–2012, one of which must have taken place in 2011–2012, and had a good standing with their National Olympic Committee.
Each National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to six men and six women athletes, with a maximum of four entries in the individual events, and two pairs in the doubles events. Any player in the world's top 56 was eligible, and NOCs had the option to enter players of a lower rank. Athletes were able to compete in both singles and doubles events. Doubles players within the top 10 doubles rankings on 11 June were eligible to bring any player provided that player had any doubles or singles ranking, and as long as the number of players from the same country did not surpass the total of six.
Competition format
The competition was a single-elimination tournament with a bronze medal match. All matches were best-of-three sets. Tie-breaks were used for the first two sets of each match. If the score was tied at one set all, a 'super tie-break' (the first pairing to win at least 10 points by a margin of two points) would be used.
Schedule
Matches took place between 1 and 5 August.

Alexander Forbes (1778–1862) was a 19th-century Scottish merchant, explorer, and author. Their book California: A History of Upper and Lower California, published in 1839, is perhaps the first full account in English of California.  They are the brother of distinguished Scottish physician Sir John Forbes.
Forbes grew up in the counties of Banffshire and Aberdeenshire. At some point, they emigrated to Tepic, Mexico, where they made their living as a merchant.  They are also recorded as having been the British consul to Mexico. It was during their time here that they wrote their book. One of the remarkable aspects of the book is that Forbes wrote it without ever having visited California at the time.
At the time Forbes was writing, California was a province of Mexico. Forbes drew upon the accounts of California's Franciscan Padres to inform their work, as well as other agents, including southern California cattleman and landowner Abel Stearns. Their work contains extensive descriptions of Mexican California, including accounts of California's agriculture and its landscape. Forbes advocated that the United Kingdom take control of California, and suggested that the territory might be ceded to the UK in return for forgiving Mexico's debt to the British government.
In 1846, Barron, Forbes & Co., which was composed of Forbes, Eustace Barron (who served as consul before him), and the British vice-consul to California, James Alexander Forbes (no relation), purchased the New Almaden quicksilver mines from Andrés Castillero, which proved to be extremely profitable. However, another man, José de los Reyes Berreyesa, also lay claim to the mine on the basis that it lay on land given to them in a land grant by the Mexican governor of Alta California. Furthermore, Justo Larias also claimed ownership, and the United States government even stepped in to claim that the mine lay on public land. A complex legal case involving Mexican laws and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo described by The New York Times as "one of the most remarkable civil trials in this or any other country", United States v. Andres Castillero eventually reached the United States Supreme Court whereupon it was finally
decided in 1862 that, the mine was on the Larias grant, and that the furnaces and improvements of the company below the hill were on the Berreyessa grant. The company bought into these two titles and then sold the entire operation in 1864 to the Quicksilver Mining Company.
Forbes, however, had moved to London in 1848 to stay with their brother. They retired to Whitchurch-on-Thames in 1859 after their brother suffered a series of strokes. Forbes died in 1862 at the age of 84.

"The List" is the fourteenth episode and season finale of the eleventh season of the American animated television series South Park, and the 167th episode of the series overall. It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 14, 2007.
In the episode, the fourth grade girls have made a secret list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest. When the boys steal the list, they are completely unprepared to deal with the results.
Plot
The boys discover that the girls in their class have made a list of them, ordered by cuteness. The boys, after two attempts, eventually succeed in stealing the list and discover it ranks Clyde as the cutest, and Kyle as the ugliest, with Cartman just above him. Kyle's spirits plummet after this discovery, while Clyde's ego inflates dramatically and they start flirting with many girls at school. They take pity on Kyle and kindly reassures them that Abraham Lincoln, who was apparently ugly, accomplished so much. Kyle, in an act of depression, starts hanging out with the ugly kids, and gets the idea from a boy named Jamal to burn the school down.  They are visited by the ghost of Abraham Lincoln, who shows them that ugliness can be a blessing in disguise; ugly people like Jamal have nothing handed to them and they must earn what they seek and will thus develop character, while beautiful people will have no redeeming character when their looks begin to fade. Kyle decides to go ahead with their plans of arson regardless, citing the long wait they would have to endure in order to realize this blessing, and the hardships and misery they would suffer in the interim.
Meanwhile, Stan watches Kyle's behavior with increasing unease. Eventually, they ask their ex-girlfriend Wendy (who thought that they aren't going to speak to them again) why Kyle was voted ugliest. Wendy begins investigating and discovers that the ballots were rigged in Clyde's favor: Since Clyde's father owns a shoe store, some of the girls wanted to make Clyde popular to justify dating them and getting free shoes. They hid the real list and forged a new one, meaning that the girls let Cartman and Kenny steal the list. Wendy steals the real list from them and they and Stan run off to find Kyle, who is about to set the school on fire.
Stan and Wendy explain the truth to Kyle, when Bebe shows up and holds them at gunpoint, while admitting that Kyle was a "casualty" of their plot. However, Wendy has called the police, who arrive almost at once. Bebe is shocked, which Wendy takes advantage of to wrestle the gun from them A shot goes off; however, neither Wendy nor Bebe are hurt. The bullet flies off killing Kenny at home as they eat cereal. Bebe is apprehended, and their fate remains unknown after this. Kyle refuses to take a look at the real list, fearing an inflated ego that Abraham Lincoln's ghost warned them about, and has Wendy burn it. Wendy admits to Stan that they have enjoyed their company and feels that they have changed a lot since their breakup. Unfortunately for Wendy, Stan has not quite lost their habit of throwing up out of nervousness and their attempt to kiss them is interrupted when they vomit in their face.
Extended ending
There is an extension to the ending, which has the list being burned, only for Wendy to reveal that they looked at the list and reveals that Eric Cartman is the ugliest boy. The final scene shows Cartman at lunch having to eat with the ugly kids. Butters is now mocking him. They try to convince everyone that it doesn't matter and it's what is on the inside that counts—but they then remembers who that is and gets even more depressed.
Production
"The List" was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It first aired on November 14, 2007 in the United States on Comedy Central. Shortly after "The List" was originally broadcast, T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts based on the episode were made available at South Park Studios, the official South Park website. The shirt design featured a hip-looking Clyde wearing their letterman jacket. When Kenny gets shot, the pop tarts come out of the toaster, a reference to where Butch kills Vincent and the toaster pastries come out of the toaster in Pulp Fiction.
Reception
IGN gave the episode a rating of 8.9, citing it "an excellent episode and a fine way to end the season".

The Senior Officers' School, Belgaum was a British military establishment established in 1920 for the training of senior officers of all services based in India in inter-service cooperation.
History
The School was originally intended for senior officers of the Indian Army who aspired to battalion command and to ensure that all such candidates received suitable training. The School attempted to widen officers' outlook by including in its syllabus subjects that were not immediately military but led to an appreciation of the wider political, geographical and technological environment in which the Army would operate. The first commandant was Brigadier-General Henry Edward ap Rhys Pryce, who was appointed in December 1920, and the last commandant was Brigadier William Slim, who was appointed in June 1939, shortly before the school closed in September, due to the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe.
There was also a parallel establishment, the Senior Officers' School, Sheerness, at Sheerness in England.
Commandants
The following officers commanded the school during its existence:
Brigadier-General Henry E. ap R. Pryce: December 1920 – August 1924
Brigadier-General H.B. Douglas Baird: August 1924 – June 1928
Brigadier Clifton I. Stockwell: June 1928 – July 1930
Brigadier S. John P. Scobell: August 1930 – April 1932
Brigadier Martin Kemp-Welch: April 1932 – July 1935
Brigadier Alfred H. Evans-Gwynne: July 1935 – January 1937
Brigadier Daril G. Watson: January 1937 – June 1939
Brigadier William J. Slim: June–September 1939

The 2012 Salt Lake County mayoral election was held to elect the Mayor of Salt Lake County, Utah on November 6, 2012, alongside the presidential, House of Representatives, Senate, and gubernatorial elections. This marked the fourth election to the office since the post was created in 2000.
Incumbent two-term Democratic County Mayor Peter Corroon honored their two-term pledge and did not run for a third term.
During the election, despite the county voting for Republicans Mitt Romney in the presidential election, Gary Herbert in the gubernatorial and Orrin Hatch in the Senate election, Democratic State Senator Ben McAdams managed to keep the mayor's office Democratic, defeating Republican candidate, former county councilman Mark Crockett.
Candidates
Democratic Party
Ross Romero, Utah Senate Minority Leader
Ben McAdams, Utah Senate 2nd District Senator since 2009
In the first round of delegates, McAdams won 57.4% of the vote against Romero's 42.6%. Under the party constitution, a candidate would have to get 60% of delegates' vote to win the party's nomination, otherwise they would have to face their challenger in a primary election. However, due to a newly-adopted rule, if a candidate received 57% of the vote, instead of a primary, the top two candidates would face off in a second round of balloting.
McAdams ran on working with Republicans, namely to allow Salt Lake City Mayor Ralph Becker pass an ordinance prohibiting workplace and housing discrimination against LGBT residents of the city. Romero preferred voters "being energized by Democrats and go to the polls to vote for Democrats".
McAdams defeated Romero in the second round, winning 62% of the vote against Romero's 38%.

Blackwater is a town in the northeastern corner of Hampshire, England, lying in the county's Hart District. Considered to be part of the Farnborough/Aldershot Built-up Area and nearly contiguous to Camberley, Surrey, it is centred WSW from London.
Location
The northern (and, respectively, eastern) borders of Blackwater are a mixture of water-meadows and roads to Berkshire (Bracknell Forest) and Surrey (Surrey Heath). The town is centred west of Camberley, NNW of Farnborough, and east of Basingstoke. As with that much larger town, Camberley and Bagshot, it straddles the A30 road. It is centred west-southwest of London.
A pre-1900 distance sign near the nightclub on the A30, in Camberley marks "London - 30 miles", from which the centre of Blackwater is less than a mile.
The town is in the outer half of the London Commuter Belt, the fastest link being Farnborough (Main) Station on the South Western Main Line. The place sits west of where the A30 trunk road from London to Land's End crosses the River Blackwater. It is served by Blackwater railway station which is on the non-interchanging line, midway, between Reading and Guildford.
History
The first record of Blackwater, archived and known, is in 1281, when it was known as Bredeford. It grew around the ford (soon after seen as Brydrs Ford) across the Blackwater.
The White Hart Parade of shops and offices, to the west of Blackwater station, is named after the White Hart coaching inn that occupied the site in the late 19th century.
Transport connections
Trains from Blackwater station operate with a half-hourly service to Reading, and to Gatwick Airport or the shorter-stop Redhill both via Guildford. Trains do not operate directly to London, requiring a change to London Paddington at Reading, or to London Waterloo at Guildford or Wokingham. At peak times, some additional trains operate; which usually go beyond Guildford to Shalford. Trains are operated by Great Western Railway.
Train passengers seeking to commute to Farnborough North for the Sixth Form College or for London-bound trains from nearby Farnborough Main are advised that these are on the few full-stopping-services only, as a semi-fast stopping pattern prevailingly operates for convenience of the whole line and regional transport.
Buses to Camberley operate every 15 minutes via Route 3.
Local economy
Blackwater is a gateway town into Hampshire on a main national route (the A30). This 'high street' area is a dual-carriageway which subsides to singled west of the town. It passes over Blackwater railway station, as well as passing over the River Blackwater itself. Aldi, and shortly after a new Lidl supermarket was built opposite Aldi in 2003, taking up most of the shopping floorspace in the town. Blackwater has two public houses, Mr Bumble and The Royal Swan. There are two parades of shops which include food outlets, a pharmacy, a newsagent and a vinyl record store.
The largest nearby town is Camberley, which provides many jobs for residents of Blackwater due to its wide range of shops, particularly within The Mall, Camberley. Other nearby towns include Sandhurst, home to the Royal Military Academy.
Sun Microsystems were a major employer in the Blackwater Valley and their UK headquarters were in Blackwater at Guillemont Park, at the M3 motorway junction on the site of the former Guillemont Barracks. Following Oracle's acquisition of Sun in 2009, employees were relocated to Oracle's UK headquarters in the Thames Valley Park.
Suburbs
There are two suburban villages to the north, Frogmore and Darby Green, which are considered by Hart District council to be districts of Blackwater. Frogmore has its own modern village hall, village green, church and a small shopping parade. Darby Green has a shopping parade (including a Tesco Express) and a small youth centre. There is also a modern medical surgery between the two villages on Frogmore Road.
The village of Hawley, which has its own village hall, primary school, church, private leisure centre and equestrian centre, lies less than to the south on the road towards Farnborough.
Popular culture
A major portion of Wilkie Collins's 1859 novel The Woman in White is set at the house of the character Sir Percivel Glyde, Blackwater Park, in Blackwater, Hampshire.

The Ugi reaction is a multi-component reaction in organic chemistry involving a ketone or aldehyde, an amine, an isocyanide and a carboxylic acid to form a bis-amide.
The reaction is named after Ivar Karl Ugi, who first reported this reaction in 1959.
The Ugi reaction is exothermic and usually complete within minutes of adding the isocyanide. High concentration (0.5M - 2.0M) of reactants give the highest yields. Polar, aprotic solvents, like DMF, work well. However, methanol and ethanol have also been used successfully. This uncatalyzed reaction has an inherent high atom economy as only a molecule of water is lost, and the chemical yield in general is high. Several reviews have been published.
Due to the reaction products being potential protein mimetics there have been many attempts to development an enantioselective Ugi reaction, the first successful report of which was in 2018.
Reaction mechanism
One plausible reaction mechanism is depicted below:
Amine 1 and ketone 2 form the imine 3 with loss of one equivalent of water. Proton exchange with carboxylic acid 4 activates the iminium ion 5 for nucleophilic addition of the isocyanide 6 with its terminal carbon atom to nitrilium ion 7. A second nucleophilic addition takes place at this intermediate with the carboxylic acid anion to 8. The final step is a Mumm rearrangement with transfer of the R4 acyl group from oxygen to nitrogen. All reaction steps are reversible except for the Mumm rearrangement, which drives the whole reaction sequence.
In the related Passerini reaction (lacking the amine) the isocyanide reacts directly with the carbonyl group but other aspects of the reaction are the same. This reaction can take place concurrently with the Ugi reaction, acting as a source of impurities.
Variations
Combination of reaction components
The usage of bifunctional reaction components greatly increases the diversity of possible reaction products. Likewise, several combinations lead to structurally interesting products. The Ugi reaction has been applied in combination with an intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction in an extended multistep reaction.
A reaction in its own right is the Ugi–Smiles reaction with the carboxylic acid component replaced by a phenol. In this reaction the Mumm rearrangement in the final step is replaced by the Smiles rearrangement.
Another combination (with separate workup of the Ugi intermediate) is one with the Buchwald–Hartwig reaction. In the Ugi–Heck reaction a Heck aryl-aryl coupling takes place in a second step.
Combination of amine and carboxylic acid
Several groups have used β-amino acids in the Ugi reaction to prepare β-lactams.
This approach relies on acyl transfer in the Mumm rearrangement to form the four-membered ring. The reaction proceeds in moderate yield at room temperature in methanol with formaldehyde or a variety of aryl aldehydes. For example, p-nitrobenzaldehyde reacts to form the β-lactam shown in 71% yield as a 4:1 diastereomeric mixture:
Combination of carbonyl compound and carboxylic acid
Zhang et al. have combined aldehydes with carboxylic acids and used the Ugi reaction to create lactams of various sizes. Short et al. have prepared γ-lactams from keto-acids on solid-support.
Applications
Chemical libraries
The Ugi reaction is one of the first reactions to be exploited explicitly to develop chemical libraries. These chemical libraries are sets of compounds that can be tested repeatedly. Using the principles of combinatorial chemistry, the Ugi reaction offers the possibility to synthesize a great number of compounds in one reaction, by the reaction of various ketones (or aldehydes), amines, isocyanides and carboxylic acids. These libraries can then be tested with enzymes or living organisms to find new active pharmaceutical substances. One drawback is the lack of chemical diversity of the products. Using the Ugi reaction in combination with other reactions enlarges the chemical diversity of possible products.
Examples of Ugi reaction combinations:
Isoquinolines from Ugi and Heck reactions.
Pharmaceutical industry
Crixivan can be prepared using the Ugi reaction.
Additionally, many of the caine-type anesthetics are synthesized using this reaction. Examples include lidocaine and bupivacaine.

Moore's Flat was a historic mining town located on the San Juan Ridge about 19 miles northeast of Nevada City and about 5 miles northeast of North Bloomfield. The town was about 1 mile south of the Middle Yuba at an elevation of about 4200 ft. On either side of it, lay the mining towns of Orleans Flat and Woolsey's Flat, each about I mile apart. All three were settled around 1851 and their histories frequently intertwine. Collectively, they are sometimes referred to as "The Flats." All three were part of Eureka Township.
An early pioneer describes the physical relation of The Flats as follows:
"Moore's Flat, Orleans Flat and Woolsey's Flat are all similarly situated on different points of the mountain, on the north side of the ridge between the South and Middle Yuba River, and all at about the same altitude. A very deep canyon lies between each of them, but a good mountain road was built around the head of each canyon, connecting the towns."
Early History
The town was named after H. M. Moore, who settled here in 1851 and built a house and store. Moore was either the first settler, or the first married settler.
Not long afterward, an effort was made to change the name to Clinton. That name never took and by 1857, the name Clinton was dropped in favor of Moore's Flat.
By 1852, the town reportedly had about 500 residents, several stores, three hotels and "a large number of saloons." Initially, it was overshadowed by the other Flats, but as they declined in the late 1850s, and their residents moved to Moore's Flat, it became the leading town in that area.
Its heyday was in the 1860s and 70s. By the 1870s, it was considered the most important mining town in Eureka Township. The town was served by Langton's Express and by Gregory and English's stages, which connected to many of the towns on the Ridge, as well as to Marysville, Downieville and Nevada City. There was also a line which ran stages between the Flats every 15 minutes. Toll roads provided improved access to Nevada City and the Ridge communities. An enterprising stable owner established a branch in Nevada City and offered customers the option of renting a horse, dropping it off at the Nevada City branch while visiting there for a few days and then bringing the horse back to Moore's Flat, all for three dollars.
Mining
As with the other Flats, mining was initially surface mining. As that became exhausted, mining using the hydraulic process commenced. At first, that was somewhat seasonal due to the lack of water during the summer. That changed with the arrival of water from the Poorman's Creek Ditch in 1854. Other ditches soon followed.
By all accounts, gold mining in the area was very successful. In 1867, Bean noted that “immense quantities of gold have been taken from the flats. In 1872, U.S. Commissioner of Mining Statistics Rossiter Raymond described Moore's Flat as a “thriving“ town, one of whose mines had produced $65,000 in gold during one year. In the early 1870s, the Marks & Co. bank alone bought an average of over $500,000 in gold dust annually. In 1900, it was estimated that 26,000,000 yards of gravel has been washed away in the area and 15,000,000 yards remained.
Despite the overall prosperity of the mines in the area, there was periodic mining strife over two issues: the price of water and the price of labor. The price of water was of immense importance to the smaller mines that were not owned by a water company. So in 1874, mining was interrupted by a price dispute. Miners wanted to pay 8 cents an inch, not 12.5. Mining resumed when the Milton Mining and Water Company brought a new ditch to the area, lowering the price of water.
Miners Unions
Labor-management strife centered around miners' wages, and, to some extent, the related issue of use of Chinese miners, who often were paid less than other miners. In early 1865, reacting to an attempt by mine owners to reduce the wages of $3.50 or $4 a day by 50 cents, the miners organized the Moore's Flat Working-men's Protective Society. A Constitution and By-laws were adopted, and about fifty men joined. In late March, the miners struck the Illinois Company which had reduced wages. A miner who tried to return to work at the lower wage was assaulted.
In early 1977, a new Miners Union was formed in Moore's Flat. Its formative resolution announced in socialist-sounding terms that:
"We hold this truth to be self evident, that the laborer is worthy of their hire; and ... it is only by unity of action on the part of the laboring masses, as against aggregated capital, that labor can hope, comparatively to hold its own..."
Mining was often dangerous, especially around the Flats. One newspaper observed that: "There have been at Moore's and Woolsey's Flats a great many accidents, recently, among miners and most of them have proved fatal." In part, this was because the gold lay under very deep gravel causing the miners to cut steep banks which produced frequent cave-ins. One consequence of the cave-ins caused by hydraulic mining was that the town was sliding away. Wrote an observer:
"If any one wants to see a town sliding down hill, they can do so by going to Moore's Flat. The mines in the vicinity have washed close up to the town, and the banks are continually caving. Many of the houses have been moved to a place this side of the old town, which the residents call Jerico."
Sawyer Decision
Hydraulic mining produced a lot of debris in the form of gravel and dirt that washed into the Yuba River. Eventually, this debris and the sludge that came with, called slickens, interfered with farming in the Sacramento Valley. The farmers responded by filing lawsuits. 1881, the Miners Union announced a boycott of Marysville and any other town trying to stop hydraulic mining. They explained:
"This Union is made up of 203 intelligent, industrious and sober men, most of them having large families to support. They recognize that the permanent stoppage of hydraulic mining means nothing more nor less than the ruination of a large portion of Nevada county that is now thickly populated and prosperous,..." Finally, in 1884, Judge Lorenzo Sawyer ruled that the mines were creating a nuisance and ordered them to stop discharging their debris into the Yuba River or its tributaries. This effectively ended much hydraulic mining in Nevada County. As the Miners Union had predicted, it led to the decline of many mining communities.
Following the Sawyer decision, mining gradually returned to Moore's Flat. Some miners continued to hydraulic and discharge their debris illegally while others tried to contain their debris in tailing ponds. Yuba County even offered a $500 reward for detecting a violation of the injunction. But most continued drifting, which produced fewer debris. In 1896, a paper reported that: "Moore's Flat, although dead for a number of years, has at last come to the front. There has been quite a boom in mining."
Post Office
A post office was established In 1854, with the name of the town as Clinton. Josiah Cook was the first postmaster. As mentioned above, the name Clinton was never popular with the residents and in 1857, the name of the post office was changed to Moore's Flat. During the winter months, there were times when the town was so snowbound that mail had to be delivered by sled or by snowshoes. The post office was discontinued briefly in 1903 because “no one could be found to accept it." it was finally closed in 1914, after which residents got their mail in North Bloomfield.
Major Fires
While fires were common in mining towns, Moore's Flat seems to have had more than its fair share.
In January 1863, a fire which originated in the Franco American Restaurant, burned the Eagle Brewery, Justice (of the Peace) Stanley's office, and two adjoining buildings. Damage was estimated at $5,000.
On May 19, 1865, On May 19, 1865, a fire destroyed about a third of the town, including Moore's Hotel, Zellerbach‘s bank, several shops and saloons, the drugstore, the furniture store, the express office and the post office. The loss was estimated at $30,000. Arson was suspected.
In September 1868, the Moore's Flat Brewery burned down, a $2000 loss.
On July 31, 1869, another fire destroyed much of the town. The fire began in a Chinese store on Washington Street, and burned much of the Chinese quarter. In all, about 40 buildings were destroyed including several hotels, the Masonic Hall, many homes and about 15 stores and businesses, including a shoe shop, barber shop, drugstore, bank, blacksmith shop and two stables. Total loss was estimated at $100,000 of which about a third was covered by insurance. After this fire, there was little rebuilding at the site. Instead, residents moved about a half mile south and built essentially a new town.
In October 1870, a fire destroyed much of the rebuilt town, including the Masonic Hall and Marks & Co's bank. Loss was estimated at $130,000.
In February 1883, a fire destroyed many buildings, including a saloon, Brigham's bank, a drugstore and post office, a brewery and other buildings. The next year, a fire destroyed 2 hotels, a brewery and a butcher shop.
Daily Life
Perhaps because its mines were so profitable, Moore's Flat seems to have enjoyed more social and cultural amenities then many other mining towns. It had specialty shops such as a shoe store and a dressmaker. It had two banks, doctors and lawyers. Touring companies of entertainers frequently gave performances. Sporting events included prizefights, horse races, and a bowling alley. McCaffrey's Race Course hosted events such as foot races, dogfights and turkey shoots. It had its own brass band. One paper described it as "perhaps...the liveliest mountain town in the State."
The town had its own school house, described thusly: "The building is very old and badly out of repair, but the inside is comfortably furnished. Outline maps, charts and good black-boards excuse many other defects about a schoolroom. Still the building is not creditable to the enterprise and wealth of the people of Moore's Flat." In 1868, the school had 112 students.
An electoral district was centered on Moore's Flat. In the 1864 presidential election, 224 votes were cast, 124 for Lincoln and 100 for McClellan. In 1868, 188 votes were recorded, 96 for Grant. By the 1880 election, only 142 votes were cast, 81 for Hancock and 61 for Garfield. Locally, voters elected a justice of the peace and a constable.
There were several social and civic organizations. In 1863, the local Masonic Lodge, Quitman Lodge, # 88, moved its building from Orleans Flat, by then largely deserted, to Moore's Flat. The building was blown down in a windstorm in the winter of 1867 and immediately rebuilt. It was also rebuilt after the fire in July 1869, burned again in October 1870 and rebuilt in 1871. An Oddfellows Lodge was established on October 22, 1870, sharing the Masonic hall. In 1873, the Ancient Order of Hibernians organized a lodge.
Given the presence of many saloons, it is not surprising that a Sons of Temperance Union branch was founded. Worshipers could attend Saint Josephs Catholic Church which was constructed in 1869. Fathers Dalton and Griffin came from Grass Valley to preside over services. There were also non-denominational services held at the temperance hall.
But Moore's Flat also had its share of violence including murders and robberies.
Chinese Community
Moore's Flat had a large Chinese community. One estimate is that there were 500 Chinese miners around Moore's Flat. They were also mines owned by Chinese. The mine owned by Wau Yen reportedly cost $70,000 and employed about 100 miners. The Chinese quarter was centered around Washington Street and was greatly destroyed by the fire of 1869.
Moore's Flat in the 20th Century
Following the Sawyer decision, Moore's Flat began a rapid decline. In 1924, it was described as follows: "Moore's Flat, from a town of three hotels, a bank and three stores, in 1890, has dwindled until it is but a name, there being at the present time only one family living in Moore's Flat proper“
Today, there is nothing readily visible of the town, except lots of rockpiles, some old mining equipment and the historic cemetery.

The Singapore Civil Service are the set of civil servants working for the Government of Singapore. Together with the Singapore Armed Forces, the statutory boards, and the other independent government bodies, the civil service makes up the overall public service of Singapore. The group employs about 87,000 officers as of 2022.
Thomas Friedman of the New York Times considers the Singapore Civil Service to be one of the most efficient and uncorrupt bureaucracies in the world, with a high standard of discipline and accountability. It is also considered a key contributor to the success of Singapore since independence. Other commentators have argued that the persisting dominance of the People's Action Party (PAP) on civil office has led to complacency and groupthink, with the supporting ministries being resistant to alternative views and fundamentally unprepared for a change of government.
Overview
The civil service was inherited from the British system. Since Singapore's independence, the civil service has been closely tied with the ruling People's Action Party.
One of the ways by which the service recruits Singaporeans is through the competitive Public Service Commission (PSC) scholarship. These full-ride scholarships are awarded to prospective undergraduate and post-graduate students based on their academic performance and extra-curricular abilities; they are not need-based scholarships. Upon graduation, PSC scholars are mandated to work in the public service for a number of years on a bond. Scholars must repay the bond if they resign from the service before the completion of their mandated service. Many scholars who have remained in government have gone on to hold senior positions. Many Singaporean ministers are also drawn from the civil service, particularly from government scholars.
The highest-ranking civil servant within a ministry is known as the ministry's permanent secretary. Permanent secretaries in each ministry used to be permanent in their postings. The current practice is to rotate them in various ministries every few years.
Head of the Civil Service
The highest ranking civil servant is the head of the Civil Service. The head of the Civil Service as of September 2017 is Leo Yip, who also holds the positions of Permanent Secretary at the Prime Minister's Office (Strategy Group) and National Security and Intelligence Coordination.
Salaries
The salaries of highly-ranked civil servants in Singapore are some of the highest in the world, and are pegged to the salaries of the earning Singaporeans. Some have criticised the government for overpaying its employees. In response, the government has maintained that a high pay is necessary to prevent corruption, attrition, and the influence of outside money in public service, as well as to attract talent from the private sector.
The salary of civil servants is organised into grades. The salary of members of parliament, cabinet ministers, and judges are also based upon this scale. Salary grades generally begin with one or two letters, and end with a number that corresponds. The top civil service grades are grades 1 to 4. The ministerial salary is also pegged on MR grades 1 to 4:
The salaries of political appointment holders, such as the members and speakers of parliament, are ratios of the MR4 salary. While new ministers salaries start off at the MR4 grade, the Prime Minister may increase a minister's pay grade at their discretion. While the salaries of political leaders are generally fixed upon the pay grades, the salaries of civil servants may vary greatly. For example, the MR4 discount of being only 60% of the median top salary is done only for ministers, "to reflect the ethos of sacrifice that political service involves", and does not apply to civil servants.
For most civil servants, the pay scale consists of ranges rather than specific fixed salaries, and the actual salaries of civil servants can vary widely depending on performance and other factors. Most civil servants can be divided into three divisions, which each having its own pay grading system: Management Executives (MX); Operations Support (OSS); and Technical Support.
Senior civil servant pay grades are sometimes known as Staff Grade and Superscale (for senior management). MX9 superscale officers have an average annual salary range of about $200,000 to $260,000.
Code of conduct
Civil servants need to declare casino visitation within a week if they went to 2 local casinos more than four times a month, or if they have bought an annual entry pass.

Oregon College of Art and Craft (OCAC) was a private art college in Portland, Oregon. The college granted Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of Fine Arts degrees as well as art-focused certificates. The college offered an Artist-in-Residence program and provided continuing education in the arts to the local community. It was founded by Julia Christiansen Hoffman, a photographer, painter, sculptor, metalworker and weaver, out of their desire to foster the Arts and Crafts movement through classes and exhibitions. The college closed at the end of the spring 2019 semester.
History
The college was founded in September 1907 as the Arts and Crafts Society. Initial classes were held in the homes of members of the society, and included classes on sculpting, painting, metal works, and photography, among others. The school moved to a permanent site in Downtown Portland, the Kramer Building, in 1934 before merging with the Allied Art and Metal Guild in 1952. After the merger, the combined schools moved to Northwest Portland where in 1962 they moved into a larger space at a former hospital building.
The school grew and became known as the "Oregon School of Arts & Crafts" in 1978. Also that year, the school expanded its campus, adding of space at a cost of $1.5 million. Architect John Storrs designed the new campus. The college began offering a bachelor of fine arts degree in 1994.
In 1996, the school changed its name to reflect its college status, from "Oregon School of Arts and Craft" to the "Oregon College of Art and Craft".
About 2005 the school started a capital campaign in order to raise over $14 million to expand the campus and double the size of their facilities. Plans called for a new library and studios for their painting, drawing, and photography programs that would add of space on campus. In September 2008, a groundbreaking ceremony was held for the studios building, with plans calling for completion in summer 2009. The building opened in September 2010 as the Jean Vollum Drawing, Painting and Photography Building. Plans for the new library, however, fell through for the time being.
OCAC announced a joint master's in fine art program for applied craft and design with the Pacific Northwest College of Art in October 2008. College president Bonnie Laing Malcolmson announced their resignation in December 2009, effective May 2010. Denise Mullen was then named as president of the school in June 2010, with their taking office on August 23. The college added a masters in fine arts in applied craft and design offered in collaboration with the Pacific Northwest College of Art. in 2011. Starting in the fall 2013 OCAC started offering a Master in Fine Arts in craft.
Throughout the 2010s, the college explored many restructuring options to address the rising costs of running a small art college. In late 2018, the college briefly explored merging with the Pacific Northwest College of Art but they decided against the merger. A few months later, the college's board of trustees decided to close the college at the end of the spring 2019 semester. In April 2019, the campus was sold to the nearby Catlin Gabel School for $6.5 million, which plans to use it for an expanded middle school.
Academics
Enrollment in the BFA program ranged from 140-200 full-time students. Most students were between 18 and 27 years old. The college's MFA program held 10 full-time students. The Continuing Education and Art Adventures children's programs served more than 2,000 students per year.
The school was a member of the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design(AICAD) and was accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD) and the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU). The school's library held more than 9,000 books and was a member of the Washington County Cooperative Library Services (WCCLS).
Faculty
OCAC employed around 15 full-time faculty and 8 part-time faculty in the degree program, as well as a number of instructors in the Studio School continuing education program.
Campus
OCAC was located on a wooded campus, approximately 3 miles from Downtown Portland in unincorporated Washington County. The campus was designed by Barbara Fealy, a landscape architect, and John Storrs, a Portland architect.
Centrum
The Centrum was the primary building and hub of the campus. It housed the front desk, school shop, the Hoffman Gallery, the campus' IT office and computer lab, and Nicoletta's Cafe.
Cafe
OCAC long held a strong relationship with the Hands On Cafe, serving the campus gourmet comfort foods for many years. With the retirement of a family member, the family owning the café decided not to renew their contract with the college in late 2013. Beginning on January 20, 2014, Leather Storrs, son of architect John Storrs, took up a lease with the college for the café space, continuing their family's legacy and connection to OCAC. Storrs' Eight|Three|One Cafe served similarly styled food to the Hands On team, maintaining the rustic at-home feel the campus provided.
Library
The OCAC Library was located in the Yellow House, owned by the college. Residing in the basement level of the remodeled house, the library provided access to a unique collection of diverse resources that supportrd curricular and research activities at OCAC. The library held more than 10,000 materials, including books, student theses, media, ephemera and more pertaining to fine art and craft. The library housed a slide library made up of 28,000 slides and also subscribed to over 90 periodicals (magazines) and four primary art databases for community use. The library was a participating member of the Washington County Cooperative Library Services, which gave OCAC students, faculty and staff access to over a million library resources and dozens of additional databases. Although the Library was dedicated to supporting the College community, it was also open to the public for research and checkout.
The library facility was staffed by a librarian (the Director of library Services) and 8-10 student workers. Operating from 9am to 5pm most days, the librarian assisted students in research of art, craft, technique and more. In addition, staff held events in the library and on campus. These included knitting circles, resume workshops, class lectures, and other events to support the students' progress through their education.
Art On the Vine
Art On the Vine was OCAC's yearly gala and fundraiser. All proceeds directly supported scholarship funding for BFA and MFA students, and for youth attending OCAC's Art Adventures Camps. The event featured a silent auction of roughly 120 pieces of art (including student works, faculty, alum, local artists and beyond) and roughly 35 wine packages.

Dinoponera lucida is a large queenless species of ant in the subfamily Ponerinae. The species, endemic to Brazil, is threatened by habitat destruction. Workers range from 27 to 30 mm in body length, which is slightly larger than the related species Dinoponera australis, but smaller than other large ants. Males are unknown.
Distribution
Dinoponera lucida inhabits fragments of Atlantic rainforest in the Brazilian state of Espirito Santo, across the border into Minas Gerais, the southern portion of Bahia and São Paulo. It is possible that D. lucida exists in Rio de Janeiro. With the locality data available Dinoponera lucida is the only species with no known range overlaps with other Dinoponera species.
Dinoponera lucida has been classified as vulnerable in Brazil by the Ministry of the Environment due to habitat destruction in the Atlantic forest.

Lenhart, Dash & MacKay (2013) recognized Dinoponera lucida as a valid species based on the unique suite of characters including a tooth-like process on the pronotum, smooth and shiny integument, long and flagellate pilosity and petiole slanting forward on the dorsal edge. However, they note that a limited sample size restricted the certainty with which they could assert that Dinoponera lucida is a separate species because a broad spectrum of intraspecific variation may not be represented. There may be a possibility of character integration with Dinoponera australis in the area between the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Dinoponera lucida is only slightly larger than Dinoponera australis but differs in its integument micro-sculpturing and pilosity type. Dinoponera lucida can be confused with Dinoponera australis but is distinguished by its shiny integument and whitish setae, as opposed to the micro-sculptured integument and dull tan setae of Dinoponera australis.
Description
Workers of this species can be recognized by the following combination of character states: anterior inferior pronotal corner with tooth-like process, pilosity long and flagellate with white luster, integument smooth and shiny with bluish luster, scape length longer than head width, petiole slanting obliquely on dorsal edge. Total body length ranges from 27–30 mm which is between the lengths of Dinoponera australis and the other larger species.
Males are unknown.

Turns to Gold is the second album of American singer and pianist Gabe Dixon. It was released on April 8, 2016, on Dixon's own label, Rolling Ball Records. The album is produced by Paul Moak and features a duet with Natalie Prass entitled "The Way To Love Me".
In their first solo album One Spark, they would play primarily grand piano. However, on Turns to Gold, they performed all but one song on an upright piano. This choice conveyed a different energy. They and the musicians, including Jano Rix on drums (The Gabe Dixon Band, The Wood Brothers), Viktor Krauss on bass (Lyle Lovett), and Kris Donegan on guitar (Cam), cut everything to analog tape with no click track. The album also features vocal performances by Jason Eskridge, Garrison Starr and Boots Ottestad. Mastering was done by Brad Blackwood at Euphonics Mastering.

The 1991 Bangladesh cyclone was among the deadliest tropical cyclones on record. Forming out of a large area of convection over the Bay of Bengal on April 24, the tropical cyclone initially developed gradually while meandering over the southern Bay of Bengal. On April 28, the storm began to accelerate northeastwards under the influence of the southwesterlies, and rapidly intensified to super cyclonic storm strength near the coast of Bangladesh on April 29. After making landfall in the Chittagong district of southeastern Bangladesh with winds of around , the cyclone rapidly weakened as it moved through northeastern India, degenerating into a remnant low over the Yunnan province in western China.
One of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded in the basin, the tropical cyclone caused a 6.1 m (20 ft) storm surge, which inundated the coastline, causing at least 138,866 deaths and about US$1.7 billion (1991 USD) in damage. As a result of the catastrophic damage, the United States and other countries carried out Operation Sea Angel, one of the largest military relief efforts ever carried out.
Meteorological history
On April 22, 1991, a circulation formed in the southern Bay of Bengal from a persistent area of convection, or thunderstorms, near the equator in the eastern Indian Ocean. Within two days, the cloud mass encompassed most of the Bay of Bengal, focused on an area west of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. On April 24, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as a depression, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) labeled the system as Tropical Cyclone 02B. Ships in the region reported winds of around around this time.
From its genesis, the storm moved northwestward, and early forecasts from the JTWC anticipated that trajectory would continue toward Andhra Pradesh in southeastern India, due to a westward-moving ridge over India. The cyclone gradually strengthened, amplified by a wind surge from the south. The IMD upgraded the depression to a cyclonic storm on April 25, and to a severe cyclonic storm on the following day. By April 26, wind shear had decreased to near zero as an anticyclone developed aloft the hurricane. Around this time, the cyclone rounded the western periphery of a large subtropical ridge over Thailand, and the storm turned northward between the ridge to the northeast and northwest. The IMD upgraded the system to a very severe cyclonic storm on April 27, estimating winds of 142 km/h (89 mph). By this time, the JTWC anticipated a future track toward the Ganges Delta region of eastern India and Bangladesh.
On April 28, the flow of the southwesterlies caused the cyclone to accelerate to the north-northeast. This flow also amplified the storm's outflow, and the cyclone intensified further. By 12:00 UTC on April 28, or about 31 hours before landfall, the JTWC was correctly forecasting a landfall in southeastern Bangladesh. Early on April 29, the IMD upgraded the system to a super cyclonic storm – the highest category – and estimated peak winds of . The JTWC estimated peak winds of , the equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale or a super typhoon. The IMD also estimated a minimum barometric pressure of 918 mbar (hPa; ), while the JTWC estimated a minimum pressure of 898 mbar (hPa; ). The cyclone's high winds and low pressure, a rarity for the Bay of Bengal, ranked it among the most intense cyclones in the basin. At 19:00 UTC on April 29, the cyclone made landfall about 55 km (35 mi) south of Chittagong in southeastern Bangladesh while slightly below its peak strength. Moving through the mountainous terrain of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the cyclone quickly weakened and crossed into northeast India, where it degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area.
Background and preparations
Until 2004, tropical cyclones were not named in the north Indian Ocean. Through its role as Regional Specialized Meteorological Center, the IMD issued warnings on the storm, designating it Super Cyclonic Storm BoB 1. The agency tracked the storm using satellite imagery, radar, and other meteorological stations. The JTWC, providing warnings and support to American military interests, designated the storm as Tropical Cyclone 02B, and also referred to it as a "super cyclone". Although the cyclone was officially unnamed, documents from the United States Agency for International Development and the United States Army referred to the storm as Cyclone Marian. Time magazine referred to the storm as Cyclone Gorky.
The Bay of Bengal is prone to large storm surges, which is the rise in seawater accompanying a cyclone landfall. The low-lying coast of Bangladesh along the Bay of Bengal is heavily populated, with at least 120 million people. In 1970, a cyclone struck Bangladesh and killed at least 300,000 people.
Before the cyclone moved ashore, an estimated 2–3 million people evacuated the Bangladeshi coast. In a survey by the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the main reason more people did not evacuate was underestimating the severity of the cyclone. The JTWC maintained contact with the American embassy in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka, assuring that it would not have to be evacuated due to a projected track farther southeast.
Impact
The cyclone made landfall in southeastern Bangladesh around the time of high tide, which was already above normal; in addition, the cyclone produced a storm surge that inundated the coastline. The storm also brought winds of around . Winds exceeding lashed a populated region of the coast for about 12 hours, as well as 12 offshore islands.
An estimated 138,000 people were killed by the cyclone. More than 20,000 people died on Kutubdia Upazila, an island offshore Chittagong where 80–90% of homes were destroyed, and all livestock were killed. Some smaller offshore islands lost their entire populations. There were around 25,000 dead in Chittagong, 40,000 dead in Banshkali. About 13.4 million people were affected. Around 1 million homes were destroyed, leaving 10 million people homeless. The storm surge caused whole villages to be swept away.
The storm caused an estimated $1.5 billion (1991 US dollars) in damage. The high velocity wind and the storm surge devastated the coastline. Although a concrete levee was in place near the mouth of the Karnaphuli River in Patenga, it was washed away by the storm surge. A large number of boats and smaller ships ran aground. The Bangladesh Navy and Bangladesh Air Force, both of which had bases in Chittagong, were also heavily hit. The Isha Khan Naval Base at Patenga was flooded, with heavy damages to the ships. Most of the fighter planes belonging to the air force were damaged. The extensive damage caused the price of building materials to greatly increase. For an additional three to four weeks after the storm had dissipated, mass land erosion resulted in more and more farmers losing their land, and therefore, the number of unemployed rose. In several areas up to 90 percent of crops had been washed away. The shrimp farms and salt industry were left devastated.
Elsewhere
The JTWC tracked the cyclone as moving northeastward from Bangladesh into northern Myanmar, dissipating in western China over Yunnan province. In Northeast India, continuous rainfall and gusty winds affected Tripura and Mizoram states, causing "some loss of life" according to the IMD. Many houses in the two states were destroyed, and telecommunications were disrupted.
Aftermath
In the days after the storm, homeless Bangladeshis overcrowded shelters, and many storm victims were unable to find shelter.
On the island of Sonodia its inhabitants were suffering from diarrhea from drinking contaminated water, respiratory and urinary infections, scabies and various injuries with only rice for food. Out of the ten wells on the island only 5 were functional of which only one providing pure water with the rest contaminated by seawater.
As a result of the 1991 cyclone, Bangladesh improved its warning and shelter systems. Also, the government implemented a reforestation program to mitigate future flooding issues.
Operation Sea Angel
The United States amphibious task-force, consisting of 15 ships and 2,500 men, returning to the US after the Gulf War was diverted to the Bay of Bengal to provide relief to an estimated 1.7 million survivors. This was part of Operation Sea Angel, one of the largest military disaster relief efforts ever carried out, with the United Kingdom, China, India, Pakistan and Japan also participating.
Operation Sea Angel began on May 10, 1991, when President Bush directed the US military to provide humanitarian assistance. A Contingency Joint Task Force under the command of Lieutenant General Henry C. Stackpole, consisting of over 400 Marines and 3,000 sailors, was subsequently sent to Bangladesh to provide food, water, and medical care to nearly two million people. The efforts of U.S. troops, which included 3,300 tons of supplies, are credited with having saved as many as 200,000 lives. The relief was delivered to the hard-hit coastal areas and low-lying islands in the Bay of Bengal by helicopter, boat and amphibious craft.
The US military also provided medical and engineering teams to work with their Bangladeshi counterparts and international relief organisation to treat survivors and contain an outbreak of diarrhea, caused by contaminated drinking water. Water purification plants were built and prevalence of diarrhea amongst the population was reduced to lower than pre-cyclone levels.
After the departure of the task force, 500 military personnel, two C-130 cargo planes, five Blackhawk helicopters and four small landing craft from the task force remained to help finish off relief operations in outlying districts and rebuild warehouses. The amphibious landing ship (LKA-116) delivered large quantities of intravenous solution from Japan to aid in the treatment of cyclone survivors.

Theodor Granderath (19 June 1839, Giesenkirchen, Rhine Province – 19 March 1902, Valkenburg, Netherlands) was a German Jesuit scholar.
Life
After completing the course in the gymnasium at Neuss, they studied theology in the University of Tübingen, and entered the Society of Jesus at Münster, Westphalia (3 April 1860). Between 1862 and 1874 they finished their studies in the classics, philosophy, theology, and canon law.
In 1874 they were appointed professor of canon law in the college of Ditton Hall, England, where from 1876 to 1887 they taught dogma and apologetics. In 1887 they were sent to the college of the Society at Exaeten, Netherlands, to succeed Gerhard Schneemann in the preparation of the Acta et Decreta Concilii Vaticani.
In 1893 they were called to Rome, where Pope Leo XIII placed the archives of the First Vatican Council at their disposal, with a view to a history of that council. In 1897 and 1898 they replaced the professor of apologetics at the Gregorian University. In 1901 failing health compelled them to retire to the college at Valkenburg, where they prepared the first two volumes of their history of the Vatican Council.
Works
In preparation for their work on the Vatican Council they first edited the Acta et Decreta sacrosancti oecumenici Concilii Vaticani (Freiburg im Br., 1890), the seventh volume of the Acta et Decreta sacrorum Conciliorum recentiorum in the Collectio Lacensis. This was followed by the Constitutiones dogmaticae s. oecumenici Concilii Vaticani ex ipsis ejus actis explicatae atque illustratae (Freiburg im Br., 1892). The publication of their Geschichte des vaticanischen Koncils von seiner ersten Ankundigung bis zu seiner Vertagung, nach den authentischen Dokumenten dargestellt was continued after the author's death by their fellow Jesuit Konrad Kirch. Two volumes of this work, which the author themselves prepared for the press, were issued in 1903 at Freiburg im Breisgau, the first dealing with the preliminary history and the second with the proceedings of the council to the end of the third public session. The third and last volume was published in 1906 and treats of the final proceedings. The unabridged text of the acts of the council, especially of the discourses delivered in the general congregations, was laid before the public.
Granderath was also the author of many apologetic, dogmatic, and historical articles in the Stimmen aus Maria-Laach (1874–99), the Zeitschrift für kath. Theologie (1881–86), and the Katholik (1898). The second edition of the Kirchenlexikon contains several lengthy articles by him, among others that on the Vatican Council (XII, 607-33).

Lena Culver Hawkins (September 23, 1866 - June 6, 1949) was one of the first female mayors in the United States and a suffragist associated with the National American Women Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and served as secretary of the Florida Federation of Woman's Clubs for twenty years. They were also an advocate for the Good Roads Movement.
Personal life
Lena H. Culver was born in Laurence, Michigan, the second of five children to Anson Brewster Culver and Emma Spooner Hand. As a descendant of John Alden, their family had first arrived in the United States on the Mayflower. Hawkins was a five feet tall and was known for always wearing high heeled shoes.
They married Charles Edwin Hawkins on September 15, 1891 in Chicago, Illinois. Charles owned the Queen City Paper Company in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Hawkins' son, Allan, was born in 1893. They left Chicago for Manhattan, New York before moving to Brooksville, Florida in 1911. They lived in a home at 510 E Liberty Street in the city of Brooksville, built just six years before their arrival. Lena and Allan lived in Brooksville full time, while Charles wintered there and otherwise lived at the Cincinnati Club. The Hawkins family became connected to the Brooksville's founding families and the when Allan married Margaret Bell.
Civic activity
Hawkins immediately became involved in Brooksville, active in twenty two organizations and in leadership of many of them. Often teaming with philanthropist and reformer Margaret Dreier Robins, they helped establish a local YWCA, the first free lending library, and a secretarial college for women. They served six years as President of the GFWC Historic Brooksville Woman's Club President (1917-1923), and stayed active after their presidency, organizing fundraisers so the club could build its own facility. Obtaining land in the 1920s, they made it into a garden and began growing sweet potatoes and other produce. Proceeds were used to construct the building with Hawkins functioning as both the Clubhouse Architect and Construction Supervisor.
At the State level, Hawkins was Florida's General Federation of Woman's Clubs Recording Secretary for twenty years. They also served on their Good Roads Committee. As Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, Hawkins and other local leaders wrote an invitation to visit Brooksville to George V to recover their health.
Hawkins ran for Brooksville City Mayor in 1927 and lost by 34 votes. The following year they were the first to enter the race and no one opposed them Them central platform was making Brooksville the "prettiest town in Florida." The election made newspapers statewide. An editorial by The Miami Herald concluded as such,
"In such a setting it is unusual to find a woman commanding the votes of the principal city. That they have succeeded is a token of their own great worth and of the advancing of political light into some of the darker political corners of Florida. We hope they succeed, for Brooksville has possibilities of becoming a very beautiful place."
In addition to planting many trees and flowers in the city, Hawkins' administration also endeavored to improve infrastructure. They took the unusual tourist approach of suspending all traffic laws for a week, touting cars "may park at any and all angles, and as long as they desire" and instead of giving traffic tickets, gave away citrus fruits, and free tourist editions of the Brooksville Herald.
Hawkins' year in office was fraught with uncontrollable disasters. They gave a speech to the Winter Haven Chamber of Commerce on those problems, asserting "Florida has had enough B's in their bonnet":"Mrs. Hawkins spoke on the four Bs that have affected Florida - the 'Boom, Blows, Bugs, and Banks,' declaring the boom was over, that the storms had not harmed Florida, that the fruit fly was proving a blessing in disguise by fostering closer cooperation and diversification in agriculture, and that the weeding out of weak banks would result advantageously in the rebuilding of Florida."
They were defeated in their reelection bid by the last minute entry of former mayor Charles Price into the race and lost by a margin of 151-58. They later ran an unsuccessful bid for the Florida State Legislature.
Death and legacy
Hawkins passed away in their home at 512 E Liberty Street at 6pm on June 6, 1949 and is buried with their husband and son at the Brooksville Cemetery, both of whom had preceded them in death.
Hawkins was named "Great Floridian" in 2000 and a plaque commemorating the honor is outsider their home, "The Hawkins House," which now houses retail and restaurants to three female owned businesses.
in 2021, a group of vigilante planters set on beautifying the city named themselves "Lena Lives" after Hawkins.

Kapustin Yar is a military airfield near the town of Znamensk, Astrakhan Oblast, serving the Kapustin Yar military training ground, founded in 1946. Until the 1990s, the airfield had the code name "Picture" (previously – "Constitution").
Classed as an Airfield 3rd class. The 35th independent mixed air squadron (military unit 33782) is based at the airfield, equipped with MI-8 helicopters , with AN-26 and AN-72 transport aircraft. Ground support for flights is provided by the 88th aviation commandant's office (military unit 54003).
History
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Zhitkur military airfield, located 52 km north-east of the current airfield and 125 km east of Volgograd, was used for aviation support of the area, with an unpaved runway long and wide. This airfield was created near the village of the same name in the Pallas district of the Stalingrad region in the summer of 1942 during the Battle of Stalingrad. At the same time, up to 10 regiments of fighter, assault and bomber aviation of the 8th Air Army of the RKKA USSR Air Force were simultaneously based on the airfield. In 1953, due to the expansion of the Kapustin Yar test site, the village of Zhitkur ceased to exist, residents were relocated to other locations.
The 19th Separate Mixed Aviation Squadron (military unit 20669) to service the testing ground Kapustin Yar was formed in 1954 at the airfield of military unit 15650 in Vladimirovka village (now the city Akhtubinsk). The squadron consisted of three units: a transport unit of three aircraft Li-2, a helicopter unit of three helicopters Mi-4 and a light-engine unit on aircraft An-2, Yak-12 and По-2. Later aircraft appeared IL-12, and then IL-14.
Since 1955, the squadron aircraft began to fly to the Experimental Test Stations (OIS) of the Kapustin Yar test site located in the vicinity of Kazakhstan settlements New Kazanka, Makat, Aralsk. Somewhat later, a flight of aircraft Yak-12 of the 19th Separate Mixed Squadron began to be based at the Aralsk airfield, which performed tasks for the delivery of measurement information and the search for products.
In 1956, the squadron was relocated to a newly created airfield at the present location from a dirt runway. The airfield received the conditional name Constitution .
In 1958, a concrete runway was built at the aerodrome, which made it possible to carry out flights without fail during the autumn and spring soaking season.
On 2 November 1959, the squadron was reorganized into the 158th separate mixed air regiment. The first commander of the regiment was an inspector-pilot of the Air Force of the North Caucasus Military District, a military pilot of the 1st class, Colonel SK Teterkin
In 1970, the regiment received helicopters MI-8.
In 1989, the plane IL-14 was excluded from the regimental state, and the An-72 aircraft unit was switched on.
In 2009, the 158th air regiment was reorganized into the 35th separate air squadron, which was transferred from RVSN to Air Force of the Russian Federation.

"Wishing Well" is a song recorded by Terence Trent D'Arby. The second single from the 1987 album Introducing the Hardline According to Terence Trent D'Arby, the song reached number one on both the Soul Singles Chart and the Billboard Hot 100 on . "Wishing Well" was certified "Gold", indicating sales of 500,000, by the Recording Industry Association of America in October 1991. Written by D'Arby and Sean Oliver, D'Arby said "Wishing Well" was written "when I was in a half-asleep, half-awake state of mind", and that they "liked the feel of the words". Martyn Ware of Heaven 17 paired with D'Arby in production of the song, which was released on CBS Records. Once released, "Wishing Well", along with D'Arby's debut single "If You Let Me Stay", went into "heavy rotation" on MTV. D'Arby performed the song live at the 30th Annual Grammy Awards, where they lost the Grammy Award for Best New Artist to Jody Watley. When the single reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, it had charted for 17 weeks, the longest progress to number one in the US charts since Eurythmics' "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" in 1983.
Ben Greenman of The New Yorker credits "Wishing Well", along with other D'Arby songs, with "[bringing] soul music into the eighties". Writing about D'Arby for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the song "sparse funk", and noted how "Wishing Well" was their first major hit in the United States. Kathi Whalen of The Washington Post credited the song's chart success to D'Arby's combination of "'60s soul and pop on top", and called "Wishing Well" "bouncy".
In popular culture
The song appears in Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City fictional radio station Vice City FM.

A kuraka (Quechua for the principal governor of a province or a communal authority in the Tawantinsuyu), or curaca (hispanicized spelling), was an official of the Inca Empire who held the role of magistrate, about four levels down from the Sapa Inca, the head of the Empire. The kurakas were the heads of the ayllus (clan-like family units). They served as tax collector, and held religious authority, in that they mediated between the supernatural sphere and the mortal realm. They were responsible for making sure the spirit world blessed the mortal one with prosperity, and were held accountable should disaster strike, such as a drought. Kurakas enjoyed privileges such as being exempt from taxation, the right to polygamy and to ride in a litter.
The kuraka was an aristocrat who frequently, but not always, descended from the previous generation. Kuraka means 'superior' or 'principal', and their authority was granted by the Inca. Each ayllu actually had four kurakas: upper and lower (hanan and hurin), and each of these had an assistant. However, of the four, one kuraka was still superior to the rest.
With the conquest of Peru by the Spanish, the Spanish system of rule utilized indigenous leaders as mediators to mobilize labor and tribute from their communities for delivery to Spaniards awarded those benefits in encomienda. The system was implemented first in the Caribbean islands, where such leaders were called caciques, then Mexico, where the Arawak term cacique was extended, and then in the Andean region, where the term kuraka persisted. Indigenous elites maintained their positions so long as they played their assigned role. In the late eighteenth century, the increased taxation of indigenous put pressure on kurakas''' allegiances to their own communities and their desire to maintain their status in the colonial order. The 1781 Tupac Amaru rebellion, led by a kuraka, José Gabriel Condorcanqui, known as Tupac Amaru II, was the most serious challenge to the Spanish colonial order in the Andes since the Spanish conquest.
Magisterial Authority
One of the functions of the kurakas was to choose a bride for adult males, aged 25 and over, who could not choose, or had not chosen, a wife. The kurakas could also decide, in the event two men wanted to marry the same woman, which man would be allowed to marry. The kurakas also dealt with minor crimes, but had to refer major crimes to the provincial capital. Among other duties, the kurakas settled disputes, allocated agricultural lands, organized community events, and officiated ceremonies.
Kurakas in the Spanish colonial era
The kurakas experienced a transformation during the first years of Spanish conquest of Peru. Since the Inca had not consolidated their rule over many regions, some kurakas were anti-Inca and pro-Spanish. Outside of the former Inca capital of Cuzco, "the regional caciques [kurakas] were the most resolute collaborators with the Spanish Crown." In Peru and elsewhere in Spanish America, the Spanish crown recognized indigenous nobility, so long as they were loyal to the Spanish monarchy. They were exempt from taxation and were granted privileges to ride horses and carry swords. This did not entail a renunciation of their traditional sources of power and prestige. In practical terms, the kurakas collected tribute and mobilized labor, essential to the functioning of the economy under Spanish rule. Some kurakas in the colonial era attempted to strengthen their claims to power and intermarried with the royal Inca descent groups, while at the same time pledging loyalty to the Spanish crown. This situation resulted in their needing to reconcile these two loyalties in the colonial situation.
The role of the kuraka was further transformed in the late colonial era. In the late eighteenth century during the Bourbon reforms, administrative reorganization by the Spanish crown, taxes were increased and greater pressure was put on kurakas as mediators, a key element in the massive, coordinated Andean uprising in 1780-1 known as the Tupac Amaru rebellion. In the period after the Great Rebellion, the crown no longer recognized the kurakas, delegitimizing their lineages and extinguishing them. The traditional elite attire of indigenous nobles was banned, as was music, dance, painting of images of Incas, Inca names, and other cultural manifestations of Inca power and influence. The crown rewarded loyalist kurakas with material rewards, such as money and land, as well as markers of prestige, such as military promotions and titles. However, the power and position of kurakas in general was eroded. At independence in 1825, independence leader Simón Bolívar abolished titles of nobility.

Amal Women's Training Center and Moroccan Restaurant (; ) is a non-profit organization in Marrakesh, Morocco, that helps disadvantaged women gain work experience by training them in the preparation of Moroccan food and international food. The center was established in 2012 by Nora Belahcen Fitzgerald. Each year 30–40 women complete four to six months of training, which often leads to them finding employment in a relevant field.
History
Nora Belahcen Fitzgerald first conceived of the idea of creating an organization to help Morocco's underprivileged women through career training in 2006 after meeting a single mother begging on the street who lived on 2030 dirhams per day (about €2.70, $3.40 in 2006). Belahcen Fitzgerald was inspired by the Association Solidarité Féminine, which helps single mothers overcome poverty and social stigma by providing them with shelter, counselling, and vocational training. They decided to begin helping women by teaching them to make baked goods in their family's language center. This proved to be successful, and the participants were able to make more money using their new skills than by begging. In 2008, Belahcen Fitzgerald began hiring underprivileged Moroccan women to cook for events they organized for them friends.
In 2012 Belahcen Fitzgerald found a property to rent and registered Amal Women's Training Center and Moroccan Restaurant as a non-profit organization. In early 2013 the center raised more than $7300 through crowdfunding on RocketHub, exceeding its $5000 goal. The money was used to purchase kitchen equipment and to ensure the kitchen was up to code. The restaurant opened in April 2013, and in July 2013, the center was awarded a three-year grant by the Drosos Foundation with the goal of making the program self-sustaining by 2016. The first group of trainees began training in February 2014. Within the first month of operation, several of the restaurant's customers had expressed interest in hiring future Amal graduates to work at local hotels and restaurants. The center completed a second round of crowdfunding on RocketHub in 2014, raising more than $9600. In October 2015 the center was awarded €25,000 by the Orange Foundation. Belahcen Fitzgerald stated that the prize money would be used to help women start their own catering micro businesses.
Restaurant
The restaurant's menu changes daily and includes traditional Moroccan dishes as well as international selections. The restaurant is open for lunch daily from 12:00 to 16:00, and for dinner by reservation for groups of 20 or more. A playroom and nursery, staffed by an American preschool teacher, is available for the children of staff and customers. Moroccan cuisine cooking classes for the public are available in Arabic, English, and French. As of August 2018 the restaurant averages 100 customers per day.
Trainees
The center's trainees are generally divorced mothers, widows, orphans, or former child maids, aged 18–35, who have little or no formal education. Participants are selected through partnerships with other non-profits or by the center's social worker, based on the criteria that they are economically disadvantaged and are motivated to train to achieve financial independence. Around 15–20 women are chosen twice a year to complete four to six months of training. After graduating from the training center, they are provided support to find relevant employment. As of June 2015 80% of Amal graduates have found employment in a relevant field. Over 200 women have been trained at the organization as of August 2018.
Staff and volunteers
As of March 2018 the center has 25 full-time employees, including program staff and culinary teachers.
As of 2015 the center has 12 full-time volunteers: an Arabic teacher, two English teachers, two French teachers, a translator, a life coach, two hygiene teachers, a psychologist, and two teachers who help the trainees develop conflict-resolution and communication skills. There are also several part-time volunteers, who help in various capacities as needed. The center also employs a social worker with a PhD in clinical psychology, who provides counselling.
Belahcen Fitzgerald is the president of the organization. The managing director is Moulay Hassan Aladlouni.
Operation
Program participants receive job training, are trained in culinary arts and attend arts and crafts classes. They are provided with two meals a day, a transportation stipend, life-skills coaching, individual and group therapy, and a bonus upon successful completion of the program. Language classes are offered in Arabic literacy (because many of the trainees are illiterate), English, and French. In partnership with Search for Common Ground, the center educates the trainees on subjects such as life planning, empowerment, Nonviolent Communication, and reproductive health. Center staff help participants find employment with outside businesses upon graduation.
About 45% of the training center's revenue comes from restaurant sales, 5% from private donations, and the remaining 50% from the Drosos Foundation. All profits are reinvested into the training program.
Belahcen Fitzgerald has stated the desire to train additional women by opening a separate catering service that would make lunches for school children.

Crépy-en-Valois (, literally Crépy in Valois) is a commune located in the Oise department in northern France. It is located in the Paris Metropolitan Area, northeast of the center of Paris.
History
Crépy-en-Valois was founded in the tenth century by the count of Valois and served as the capital of the Valois county and duchy. During the Middle Ages, the city profited from the Champagne fairs, markets for leather, cloth, spices, and other goods. Then, the Valois and the town of Crépy-en-Valois were annexed by the monarchy, and administration was given to a member of the royal family. During the war against the English in fourteenth century, the town was destroyed.
In 1828, Crépy-en-Valois annexed the commune of Bouillant. In 1861, a railway station was built, and the town experienced economic growth.
On 1 September 1914, the 13th Infantry Brigade of 5th Division, part of the British Expeditionary Force, fought a rearguard action here against the advancing German Army, during the Retreat from Mons.
The population of the town increased after World War II, because Crépy is located near Paris ().
Crépy-en-Valois was deeply affected by the 1982 Beaune coach crash, in which 44 local children died. Every year since the tragedy, the town hall has held a commemoration on the anniversary date.

Millinocket Lake is the source of Millinocket Stream in the North Maine Woods north of Baxter State Park. Millinocket Stream flows to Maine township 8, range 8, where it joins Munsungan Stream to form the Aroostook River. The lake extending along the border of Maine range 9 townships 7 and 8 is impounded behind a wooden dam. The dam enlarged the lake to include Little Millinocket Lake and Moose Pond by flooding adjoining bogs to store water for hydropower. The large areas of shallow flooded bog are a good habitat for fallfish, yellow perch and white suckers; but with summer water temperatures ranging from 70° near the surface to 55° in the deeper areas, dissolved oxygen concentrations become unfavorable for trout. Tributaries to the lake drain a number of small ponds to the west of the lake including Atkins Pond, Blackmore Pond, Buckley Pond, Big Caribou Pond, Little Caribou Pond, Chandler Pond, Elsie Pond, Ervin Pond, Jack Pond, Kyle Pond, Line Pond, Mathews Pond, May Pond, Little Moose Pond, Upper Moose Pond, Pretty Pond, Snowshoe Pond, and Spring Pond.

Tracy (; also spelled Tracey, Traci, Tracci, or Tracie, or Trasci), as a British personal name, was originally adopted from Norman surnames such as those of the family de Tracy or de Trasci from Tracy-Bocage in Normandy, France. Derived from the Gaulish male name Draccios, or Latin Thracius ("of Thrace, Thracian"), and the well-identified Celtic suffix -āko ("place, property"), such Norman surnames themselves sprung from several Tracy place-names in France.
The Irish surname Tracey, which may similarly have contributed to the adoption of the English personal name, is derived from the native Irish O'Treasaigh septs. The name is taken from the Irish word "treasach" meaning "war-like" or "fighter". It is also translated as "higher", "more powerful" or "superior". It may also be derived from the Irish word for three, with an association to the Tuatha Dé Danann. The first reference to the surname in the Irish Annals was in 1008: "Gussan, son of Ua Treassach, lord of Ui-Bairrche, died."
Given name
Great Britain
In England and Wales, the name Tracy was not unknown, but unusual, with about two a year, from 1837 until 1955, when, following the success of the American film star Spencer Tracy, the name quite suddenly became very popular, rising to a maximum of 7667 babies being given that name in 1964, but after 1970 the popularity quickly declined to 475 in 1985.
While the name is unisex, within the United Kingdom it is more generally considered to be a female name. Its popularity peaked during the 1960s, when Tracey was the sixth most popular female name and the alternate spelling Tracy was the 12th most popular in 1964.

Dreams is the sixth studio album by Norwegian band Fra Lippo Lippi.
When their 1989 album The Colour Album generated mediocre sales , the band parted ways with their Swedish label The Record Station and were considering breaking up. Instead, they decided to write songs for a new album. In 1991, the band recorded the songs in founder Rune Kristoffersen's basement before sending the tapes to Stockholm, Sweden, for record producer Kaj Erixon (who worked on the band's 1985 album Songs) to mix them. The album was released by Sonet Records in Norway, Polystar Records in Japan and OctoArts International (now EMI Records Philippines) in the Philippines.
Dreams was a moderate hit in the Philippines, with the song "Stitches and Burns" receiving constant airplay on radio. It would be Kristoffersen's final studio album with the band, and the band's last original recording for over a decade.

The Springfield Model 1822 was a .69 caliber flintlock musket manufactured by the United States in the early 19th century.
The Model 1822 was an improvement to the Springfield Model 1816. Some documents refer to the Model 1822 as its own separate model, but other documents refer to it as a variant of the Model 1816 designated as the Type II.
Like the Model 1816, the Model 1822 was a .69 caliber smoothbore flintlock, with a barrel and an overall length of . One of the most noticeable differences in the Model 1822 is the attachment of the lower sling swivel. The forward part of the trigger guard was provided with an enlargement which was drilled to receive the sling swivel rivet. Previously, the sling swivel had been affixed to a stud in front of the trigger guard.
In addition to the Springfield and Harpers Ferry armories, the Model 1822 was produced by numerous other independent contractors. It was eventually replaced by the Springfield Model 1835, which is also considered by many to be a continuation of the Model 1816 designated as the Type III.
Like other flintlocks, many of the Model 1822 muskets were converted to percussion lock in the 1840s and 1850s, as percussion caps were more reliable and weather resistant than flintlocks. However, during the Mexico City campaign, General Winfield Scott insisted on their army being equipped with flintlock muskets because flints were easy to make or procure, important in a hostile country where supply lines were vulnerable.
Some Model 1822 muskets also had their barrels rifled so that they could fire the newly invented Minié ball if the barrel was thick enough and structurally sound. However, the increase in breech pressure created by the new expanding bullet was too much for the conversion process and older musket barrels to contain and rifled Model 1822 muskets were issued instead with standard .69 caliber round balls.
The Model 1822 was used in both the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War. During the latter, .69 caliber muskets (mostly percussion, but some flintlocks as well) were common in the early part of the war (either in their original form or converted to rifling). They had totally disappeared from the Army of the Potomac by the second half of 1862 (aside from the Irish Brigade, which carried Springfield Model 1842 muskets until 1864), but the less-well equipped Confederate Army used them for longer, and the Army of Northern Virginia's ordnance chief claimed that Gettysburg was the first battle in which the army was completely free of smoothbore muskets.
In the Western Theater, the situation was worse for both sides and smoothbores remained in use in the Union armies into 1863. Some Confederate regiments were still carrying .69 caliber muskets at the Battle of Franklin in November 1864.

Quotes from Nune Siravyan
I love colors too much. I do not hesitate to synthesize them. I do not have a favorite color. There are no bad colors, we can combine the nuances.
In my collages I use paper, cloth materials which come to replace paint. Unlike paint they make my works more interesting and (in a good sense) complex. By their colors and forms they help me to build my fantasy world and they give an unexpected turn while working.

When I Fall in Love / My Foolish Heart
Two errors appear in the credits of "When I Fall in Love". The composer is credited as Albert Felden, but it should be Albert Selden, co-producer of Man of La Mancha who in 1948 composed a song titled When I Fall in Love for the Broadway revue Small Wonder. But, in fact, Sam Cooke sings the 'other' song, the popular "When I Fall in Love" composed for the film One Minute to Zero by Victor Young with lyrics by Edward Heyman.
Victor Young had no luck in this album because "My Foolish Heart", also composed by him, in this case with lyrics by Ned Washington, for the 1949 film My Foolish Heart is credited to H. Martin, J. Ward and S. Brown. Victor Young, died in November 10, 1956, two years before the release of this album.

Joan Mitchell Montgomery (born July 1925) is an Australian retired principal.
Early life
Montgomery was born in Melbourne in 1925, the eldest of four daughters of Beryl and William Montgomery. They attended Presbyterian Ladies' College in East Melbourne, where they played tennis and baseball. In April 1942, when Montgomery was 16, their mother died and their father's cousin Anne Montgomery came to live with the family; 20 months later, in January 1944, Montgomery's father died and Anne Montgomery assumed responsibility for the four girls.
Montgomery studied at the University of Melbourne and graduated in 1948 with a bachelor of arts degree and a diploma of education.
Career
Montgomery's first teaching position was at Frensham School at Mittagong in New South Wales, from 1949 to 1951. They then taught in London for two years (1952-54), at Tintern Church of England Girls Grammar School for two years (1955-57) and then in London again in 1958 and 1959. In 1960 Montgomery took up their first position as principal, at the private Melbourne girls' school Clyde School, a position they held until 1968 when they moved to the position of principal of Presbyterian Ladies College. Montgomery retired from the college at the age of 60, in 1985, following a change in school governance due to the re-organisation of Presbyterian schools under the newly formed Uniting Church in Australia.
Montgomery served the wider educational community as president of the Association of Independent Girls' School of Victoria and president of the Association of Heads of Independent Girls' Schools of Australia (AHIGSA). During their tenure with AHIGSA they advocated for a merge with the Headmasters' Conference of Independent Schools of Australia (HMCISA), a move which occurred in August 1985 with the formation of the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA). They were also a member of the council of The University of Melbourne, Ormond College and Medley Hall. They were a board member of the Alfred Hospital, Geelong College, Melbourne Grammar School, Woodleigh School and St Margaret's School. Montgomery was elected a Fellow of the Australian College of Education in 1977.
Recognition
Montgomery was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1976 for their services to education; in 1986 they became a Member of the Order of Australia. They were also named on the Victorian Honour Roll of Women in 2004 for their services to education.

Acceleration in human development process is the phenomenon which has been registered in many populations around the world. This applies equally to the growth of certain anthropometric parameters and the speed of reaching sexual maturity. These facts illustrate the results of secular changes in body height and appearance of the first menstruation (menarche).
Increases in human stature are a main indicator of improvements in the average health of populations. The newest data set for the average height of adult male birth cohorts, from the mid-nineteenth century to 1980, in 15 European countries was studied (in the populations listed).
During a century average height increased by 11 cm representing a dramatic improvement of this phenomenon. The apparent acceleration of body height occurred during the periods around the two World Wars and after the Great Depression.
In the mid-nineteenth century European girls' menarche occurred at the average age of 16.5 years. One hundred years later, this age was reduced to under 12 years.

Panther Garang Bior is one of the 27,000 Lost Boys of Sudan. Their journey was featured in the National Geographic Society's 2006 award-winning documentary, God Grew Tired of Us (executive produced by Brad Pitt and narrated by Nicole Kidman).
Biography
Panther was born in the village of Mareng in Bor, Sudan (now in South Sudan) in 1981. In the late 1980s, Panther was far from their home watching cattle when their village was attacked by the Muslim Sudanese Government. Escaping to the jungle, Bior, along with the other Lost Boys, spent the next five years trekking more than 1,000 miles barefoot throughout Kenya and Ethiopia, seeking refuge from the genocide, disease, and starvation. In an interview with the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Panther described the hellish journey, "We were told to run east, through the desert, to Ethiopia," they say. "We were surviving by drinking the muddy water, and from the backs of leaves and whatever fruit we could find, maybe a little bit of grass. Many people lost their lives." Panther went on to describe how their best friend had been killed by a lion and their young nephew did not survive the journey because their feet were torn up by the miles of walking, "We had to leave them in the desert," Bior says. "He died."
Finally arriving at Kakuma's refugee camp in Kenya, the Lost Boys''' numbers had been dramatically decreased. In 2001, assisted by Catholic Charities, Panther was relocated to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania along with a number of other Lost Boys to start a new life in the United States.
Today
Since first setting foot on American soil, Panther Bior has been arduously working to get established in a new culture while struggling with a myriad of mixed emotions: Interviewed in the Pittsburgh Catholic, Panther said, "It gives one hope. Now we are in America. But we think of when we were in the desert, with no clothes. I flash back to how my brothers missed the chance to come to America...I have tears of joy and tears of sorrow," they said.
In 2005, Panther traveled back to Africa to marry their girlfriend, Nyanthiec. After the wedding, they returned to the United States to fill out the necessary paperwork and begin the financial struggles of bringing their wife to the U.S. Three years later, they brought them back to the United States. Bior is currently living with their wife and two children in Pittsburgh. Graduating from Point Park University with a B.S. in Accounting, Panther is pursuing their master degree in Organizational Leadership. Bior worked for the Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) as an accounting analyst. Panther currently works at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh.
As featured in the "Take Action" section of God Grew Tired of Us, Bior is intent upon building a school in their home village of Mareng. In the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Panther is quoted as saying, "We need connections, just like the connections that brought us over from Africa." With such connections and now armed with a solid education, Panther has high hopes for the future of their homeland. "My country's rich, got a lot of oil, got a lot of gold. But our people don't know how to exploit them. So I have to come there, build a school, tell people the direction. And I can tell there's--there's improvement I'm bringing in the world." Panther is partnering with Heaven's Family'', an international ministry based out of Pittsburgh, in an effort to build a school in their homeland.

Combat 84 were an English punk rock band active during the early 1980s. Formed in 1981 in Chelsea, London by skinheads 'Chubby' Chris Henderson and 'Deptford' John Armitage, Combat 84 rose to national prominence after being featured in a controversial 1982 BBC Arena documentary about the skinhead movement.
Career
The band was originally composed of Chris Henderson (vocals), 'Deptford' John Armitage (bass guitar), Jim (guitar) and Brownie (drums) and played their first gig supporting The Last Resort at the Walmer Castle, Peckham. The Last Resort's lead singer, Roi Pearce (later of The 4-Skins) liked the band and agreed to produce a two-song demo tape with them. These sessions resulted in the songs "Soldier" and "Combat 84", which were favourably received in the music press, leading to the band being described as 'the new Sham 69'.
In 1982, the manager of The 4-Skins, Gary Hitchcock attempted to get the band signed to Secret Records, then home to The 4-Skins, The Business, Infa Riot and The Exploited, although the deal fell through at the last minute, prompting Combat 84 to sign to Victory Records for the release of their Orders of the Day EP. Former Business drummer John Fisher replaced Brownie for the recording of the second (1983) EP, Rapist.
More right-leaning, lyrically than many of their punk rock and Oi! peers, Combat 84 received much criticism for recording a song that advocated capital punishment for rapists ("Rapist"), and a song that supported nuclear weapons and criticised the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and reds ("Right to Choose"). Guitarist Jim stated in a 2000 interview that the latter song was intended in a tongue-in-cheek manner, and as a homage to Vietnam War movies. The song Politically Incorrect attacked several targets, including beggars, foreign aid, the Guardian, lesbians and women's liberation. Other lyrical themes included unemployment, inner-city violence, war, and slavish followers of fashion.
Controversy erupted around the band after they were featured in a 1982 BBC Arena documentary, during which Henderson alleged that the police were tougher on White skinheads than they were on Black rioters, said that "there will never be racial harmony" and blamed the Asians for the 1981 Southall riot, during which the band were attacked inside a gig venue. Deptford John briefly made some comments in agreement with Henderson over the riots but, in a later part of the documentary, they said that skinheads should be able to empathise with Blacks when they are denied jobs or entrance to venues, and should remember that, whereas skinheads can change how they look, Blacks cannot change their skin colour. Footage of crowd violence at a gig in Harlow was broadcast at the end of the documentary. This led to the break-up of the band, as their newly earned bad reputation discouraged venues from booking the band. Gigs were then often played under the pseudonym The 7th Cavalry to avoid the stigma of the Combat 84 name.
Victory Records, wanting little to do with the band at this point, compiled an album of studio recordings (intended for the band's debut album) and bootleg-quality live tracks and licensed it to German label Rock-O-Rama Records for release as Send in the Marines in 1984. The record was disowned by the band, which split up soon after.
In the intervening years, Combat 84 were frequently labelled as a neo-Nazi, white power or Rock Against Communism (RAC) band, a charge which has been denied by 'Deptford' John and Jim, noting that the band's songs contained no racist lyrics, nor were they ever aligned with any far-right political party. The band's reputation was made worse by the similarity in name to a neo-Nazi group called Combat 18. 'Deptford' John was able to retain a career by joining The Exploited, whose lyrics on certain issues were different to Combat 84 (e.g. The Exploited were against nuclear weapons), but John noted in a 2001 interview with the "Pissed and Proud" fanzine that they believe in free speech and whilst not supporting it, that RAC music should be allowed a platform as "people should be allowed to say what they want". In their book, Chris Henderson said that the 84 in the name was a reference to George Orwell's book 1984 and that the band adhered to the philosophy of George Orwell.
Aftermath and reunion
'Deptford' John and Jim went on to roadie for and play with the UK Subs and The Exploited, and John Fisher played with former members of The Last Resort in The Warriors. After retiring from the music business, Chris Henderson became more involved with football hooliganism, and eventually led the Chelsea Headhunters in the mid-to-late 1980s, writing the book Who Wants it? (with Colin Ward) about their experiences. They owned a bar in Pattay, Thailand and died on 31 October 2013. In 2000, the band reformed without Henderson for the release of the Tooled Up EP, released on their own 7th Cavalry record label. 'Deptford' John took over vocal duties, with Jim on guitar, and F.T. and Suds on bass and drums respectively.

Rex Garvin (July 24, 1940 – December 2, 2013) was an American rhythm and blues singer, songwriter, keyboard player and arranger. Their writing credits include the 1957 US chart hit "Over the Mountain; Across the Sea", by Johnnie and Joe, and their own 1966 recording "Sock It To 'Em J.B.", later recorded by The Specials.
Life and career
Garvin was born in Harlem and raised by foster parents in the Bronx. They took piano lessons as a child. In 1954, they helped form The Hearts, a female vocal group with whom they sang bass, played piano and wrote and arranged songs. Managed by neighbor Zelma "Zell" Sanders, The Hearts' first record "Lonely Nights" was issued on the Baton label in early 1955 and reached No. 8 on the Billboard R&B chart. They remained involved with the group as their pianist, arranger, musical director and (in their own word) "maestro" through various personnel changes during the 1950s, later explaining that they did so "mainly to meet girls". Members of The Hearts later performed as The Jaynetts.
At the same time, Garvin became Sanders' main assistant at J&S Records, which they set up in 1956, and they were responsible for the label's typical full, bottom-heavy piano-laden arrangements. The label's greatest successes came with the duo Johnnie and Joe, whose biggest hit "Over the Mountain, Across the Sea" (#8 Pop and No. 3 R&B in 1957) was written by Garvin, who sang harmony vocals on the song and was credited as bandleader. The duo comprised Garvin's friend Joe Rivers, and Sanders' daughter Johnnie. The song was covered in 1963 by Bobby Vinton, whose version reached No. 21 on the Hot 100.
Garvin's own recording career started in 1957, with "My Darling Dear". In 1959, their vocal duet with Marie Knight as Marie and Rex on "I Can't Sit Down" reached No. 94 on the Billboard pop chart. They formed their own group Rex Garvin and the Mighty Cravers in 1961, releasing their first single "Go Little Willie"/"Emulsified", on Epic Records; the single was reissued two years later by Okeh. The group toured widely on the "Chitlin' Circuit".
Although Garvin had little commercial success, they released a string of records through the 1960s in a variety of styles, including "Oh Yeah!" (on the Scatt label, an offshoot of J&S, 1962), "Soul Food" (on Keynote, 1963), "Sock It To 'Em J.B." (originally on the Like label, 1966), "I Gotta Go Now (Up on the Floor)" (Like, 1967), and "You Need No Help (You Can Sock It to Yourself)" (WSJ Sound, 1969). Several of these recordings have been anthologized in recent years, particularly on Northern Soul compilations. "Sock It to 'Em J.B." had a double meaning, being a tribute to James Bond performed in the style of James Brown; it was issued as a single in the UK as well as the U.S., and later was covered by British band The Specials on their album More Specials in 1980 (a cover which lent the song a potential triple meaning, as it was also a form of homage to drummer John Bradbury). Rex Garvin and the Mighty Cravers – comprising saxophonist Clayton Dunn and drummer Pete Holman, together with Garvin on keyboards – also released an album, Raw Funky Earth on the Tower label in 1968. Their last record release was "Strange Happenings" on the Chieftain label in 1971.
They left the Mighty Cravers and quit the music business in about 1975. They moved to Atlanta, Georgia, but continued to play occasional gigs until 1985. In 1990, "Emulsified" was covered by Yo La Tengo on their album Fakebook. Garvin died in Atlanta in 2013, aged 73.

The Satchmo Legacy is the final studio album by trumpeter Benny Bailey featuring performances associated with Louis Armstrong which was recorded in late 1999 and originally released on the Enja label.
Reception
Alex Henderson of Allmusic says, "On this session, Bailey's playing isn't as forceful, aggressive, and brassy as it was in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, although they are still enjoyable and expressive. The Satchmo Legacy isn't among Bailey's essential albums and isn't recommended to casual listeners, but it's a respectable effort that their diehard fans will appreciate".

The MAB PA-15 (Pistolet Automatique 15, also known as the P-15 or P.15 Standard) was a French semi-automatic pistol, designed by the Manufacture d'armes de Bayonne. The model number, 15, refers to the magazine capacity. The PA-15 was introduced in 1966 along with a short-lived 8-round version with a single stack magazine, the P-8.
Use
The PA-15 was designed for commercial sale, primarily for export as French laws severely restricted the possession of "military-caliber" arms (which included the ubiquitous 9mm). The pistols were proofed at the St Etienne proof house and many were exported to the US. Early pistols are blued, later ones Parkerized. There was a competition version called the P-15 F1. This version had a longer slide and barrel (150mm), and an adjustable rear sight. While the French armed forces did not adopt the PA-15, the Army, Air Force (Armée de l'Air) and the Gendarmerie bought limited quantities of the competition model under the designation Pistolet Automatique de Précision (PAP) Modèle F1. When the French Gendarmerie was looking for a double-action pistol with a high magazine capacity to replace their aging PA 1950s, MAB produced an experimental model of the PA-15 with double-action lockwork. However, the Gendarmerie instead procured a license to manufacture the Beretta 92F as the MAS G-1, and the double-action PA-15 was not commercially produced. Outside France, in the 1970s the Finnish military and some police forces adopted the PA-15.
When the Manufacture d'armes de Bayonne closed in 1982, all remaining PA-15 parts were sold to a French company, Lechkine Armory (Armurerie Chevasson), which as of 2009 still assembled and sold new PA-15s, and is the sole source for new PA-15 parts.
Functioning
MAB PA-15 is a delayed blowback operated, semi-automatic pistol. It featured Savage-type, rotating, but not reciprocating, barrel, which has two lugs: one under the chambers is engaged in the frame and allows to the barrel to rotate but not to move back or forward. The other lug (camming lug) is situated on the upper surface of the barrel: it is engaged in an L-shaped cam track in the slide. When the pistol is fired, the rotational inertia of the barrel, the bullet torque and the slide's linear inertia (leveraged through the cam track) all act against the opening force of the cartridge. When the bullet leaves the barrel, internal pressures have dropped and so the action is safe to open: the slide rotates the barrel completely, moves backward, ejects the spent casing and moves forward to pick up a new cartridge, cycling the action. MAB PA-15 has a frame mounted safety, on the left side of the frame, and also internal magazine safety, which does not allow the gun to be fired with magazine removed.
Variants
A long-barreled version, known as the PA-15 Target, was used by the French military as the PAP F-1. 7,65 Parabellum for Italian market.

Satellite crop monitoring is the technology which facilitates real-time crop vegetation index monitoring via spectral analysis of high resolution satellite images for different fields and crops which enables to track positive and negative dynamics of crop development. The difference in vegetation index informs about single-crop development disproportions that speaks for the necessity of additional agriculture works on particular field zones—that is because satellite crop monitoring belongs to precision agriculture methods.
Satellite crop monitoring technology allows performing online crop monitoring on different fields, located in different areas, regions, even countries and on different continents. The technology's advantage is a high automation level of sown area condition and its interpretation in an interactive map which can be read by different groups of users.
Satellite crop monitoring technology users are:
agronomists and agriculture companies management (crop vegetation control, crop yield forecasting, management decisions optimization);
business owners (business prospects estimates, making reasonable decisions on capital investments, providing information for management decisions);
investors and investment analysts (investment potential estimation, making investment decisions, making sustainable forecasts);
insurance brokers (data collection, clients claims verification, scale of rates and insurance premium amounts calculation);
agriculture machinery producers (integration of crop monitoring solutions with agriculture machinery board computers operations, functional development);
state and sectoral organisations engaged in agriculture, food security and ecological problems.

"Walkampf" (Whale struggle) is a song by Die Toten Hosen. It's the second single and the thirteenth track from the album Zurück zum Glück. The title is a pun on the word "Wahlkampf", which means "election campaign" in German.
The song is about a dream by the narrator, where they find a whale on a beach and struggles to push it back to the water, but doesn't have enough strength for that. All the time, they hear the waves, the sun shouting: "Push the whale back in the sea", which pressures him. They hope to get help from a Greenpeace ship they see, but right before their eyes, it sinks. The next day they have sore muscles and gets under the shower but then their girlfriend urges them to "push the whale back in the sea" and on it goes.
The song opens with a slow ukulele tune, progresses into a more aggressive punk style during the 2nd verse, with the bridge between the 2nd and third verse being overlaid with a background singer giving it a more surf rock style similar to a song by the Beach Boys, and the final verse and final chorus is accompanied by bagpipes, with the background singer returning at the very tail end of the song.
Music video
The music video was directed and drawn by Andreas Hykade. It entirely illustrates the lyrics.

The Windmill Point Light was a lighthouse located at the mouth of the Rappahannock River.
History
This light was erected in 1869 to replace the last of three lightships stationed at this location to mark the end of the Rappahannock Spit, a shoal extending east from Windmill Point itself. These lightships were stationed beginning in 1839, the first being seized by the Confederates in the Civil War. As was typical of such an exposed location, ice was a serious threat, and the light was badly damaged in the winter of 1917–1918, with repairs not completed until 1921.
Automation came in 1954, and the house was removed in favor of a skeleton tower in 1965. As with the nearby Stingray Point Light, a private party, one Dr William Atwood, purchased portions of the house in hopes of reassembling it on shore. As with the other light, however, Dr Atwood was unable to complete their plan. The tower and original foundation remain in service.
As of the 2007–2008 winter, the old girder works of the original lighthouse were removed and replaced by a single concrete-filled caisson with superstructure tower and light and placards. Note the rip rap of the original light surrounds the new structure, which is right at sea level and sometimes not visible. The lighthouse should not be approached within a 100-foot radius.
On Sunday 25 May 2008 a sailboat went aground on these rocks and required USCG and Sea Tow assistance to be towed off.
On Friday 11 Oct 2019 a sailboat went aground on these rocks and required USCG and Marine Conservation Police assistance to be towed off. Massive damage and almost loss of vessel.
Both Windmill Point Light, and Stingray Point Light have this old rip rap remaining at or below sea level. DO NOT maneuver close to either of these lighthouses!

Their first exhibition was in Calgary, Alberta featuring their geometric abstractions, while studying Environmental Psychology in the early 1980s. In the mid-1980s while working for Arthur Erickson they were influenced by abstract expressionists such as Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, Jackson Pollock, and Sam Francis.
Their current works are generally characterized as meaningful abstraction with bold contrasting colours. Their works have been shown at the Toronto International Art Fair, Fort Myers Alliance for the Arts, Singapore International Contemporary Art Fair, and the Huitai National Art Center in China.  They are represented in art collections in Canada, the United States, Japan, China, and Singapore.

The Slow Regard of Silent Things is a fantasy novella and one of the companion tales in The Kingkiller Chronicle series written by American author Patrick Rothfuss. It includes illustrations by Nate Taylor and was first published by DAW Books in the United States on October 28, 2014.
Plot introduction
The novella is focused on Auri, a character from The Kingkiller Chronicle and their adventures in the Underthing, a hidden location of old rooms and tunnels under the University. Through the seven days narrated in the book, Auri explores the Underthing, awaiting a visit from Kvothe, a time period that is covered specifically between chapters seven and eleven of The Wise Man's Fear.
Writing and structure
The writing occasionally slips into a poetic flow when describing the little things in Auri's day-to-day life. As Patrick Rothfuss themselves says, the book does not do what a "proper book should do", so that it actually does not have a clear plot. The story cannot easily be divided into a beginning, middle, and end, and does not have a proper climax. While The Kingkiller Chronicle books develop a plot and multiple characters, this novella explores one character, describing the day-to-day life of the protagonist, showing their view of the world and the way their mind works.
Background and publication
In 2012, George R. R. Martin and Gardner Dozois, co-editors of a series of cross-genre anthologies, invited Patrick Rothfuss to be in their anthology called Rogues, which Rothfuss agreed to. They initially planned to contribute a story about Auri, who they thought would make a nice counterpoint to some of the other classic rogue-type characters in the anthology.
However, after Rothfuss started writing the story, it exceeded the number of words for the anthology and the story went in a different direction from the rogue theme. They then decided to contribute a story about Bast instead, which ended up being the short story "The Lightning Tree" and was eventually published in Rogues in June 2014.
Afterwards, Rothfuss resumed their work on the third book of the trilogy, The Doors of Stone, but the half-unfinished story about Auri tickled them and eventually they went back to finish it. When they put the finishing touches on the story in February 2013, they came up with the working title The Weight of Them Desire, a phrase that appears in the first and last chapters of the book. Encouraged by feedback from their friend and mathemusician Vi Hart, they presented the story to their agent and then their editor, who were enthusiastic about it.
Rothfuss introduced the story to their friend and illustrator Nate Taylor and asked them to create illustrations for the book. Rothfuss was specific about having no explicit pictures of Auri or any of the rooms in the Underthing. It took about two months to finalize the illustrations. The story was eventually published as the standalone novella The Slow Regard of Silent Things in November 2014.
The character of Auri was partially inspired by real life tunnel dweller Tunnel Bob from Madison, Wisconsin.
Reception
The book debuted at number two position in the New York Times Best Seller Hardcover Fiction list approximately three weeks after its release. It spent a month on the list before falling out of the top 15.
The Slow Regard of Silent Things received positive reviews from critics. Marc Alpin of Fantasy Faction was impressed by the writing of Rothfuss, stating "The number of beautiful metaphors, the authenticity of Auri's voice and the emotions that the story evokes are as strong as we'd expect". Alister Davison of Starbust Magazine writes: "It is wonderfully written, the prose verging on poetic in places... There's a sense that Rothfuss has chosen every one of those words with great care and precision, using them to tell a story that's lyrical, heart-felt and unique."

Trio Jeepy is a jazz album featuring saxophonist Branford Marsalis leading a trio that included notable bassist Milt Hinton. It was recorded January 3–4, 1988 at Astoria Studios in New York, New York. It peaked at number 3 on the Top Jazz Albums chart. It was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1989 for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Group.
The AllMusic review by Scott Yanow states, "Branford Marsalis clearly had a lot of fun during this set... The performances are quite spontaneous (the occasional mistakes were purposely left in) and Marsalis really romps on such tunes as "Three Little Words," "Makin' Whoopee," and "Doxy." On the joyful outing that is also one of Branford Marsalis' most accessible recordings, Milt Hinton often steals the show."
Marsalis' cover of Makin' Whoopee would later be the first music video featured on VH1 Smooth upon its initial broadcast on August 1, 1998.

Devin Barclay (born April 9, 1983) is a former American football placekicker for The Ohio State Buckeyes. Prior to that, they were formerly a professional soccer player, who last played for the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer.
Biography
Barclay initially skipped college, opting instead to sign a Project-40 contract with MLS in 2001, at the age of 18, which allocated them to the Tampa Bay Mutiny. Barclay made a significant impact on a very bad Mutiny team as a rookie, appearing in 23 games, 12 starts, and scoring three goals and two assists. The Mutiny was contracted after the 2001 season; Barclay was selected 8th overall in the 2002 MLS Allocation Draft by the San Jose Earthquakes. Barclay did not make much of an impact on the side that had just won MLS Cup, disappointingly only appearing in 12 games, and registering no goals or assists. They were traded to D.C. United in exchange for a draft pick, but disappointed in D.C. as well; they only appeared in three games for United, as coach Ray Hudson preferred not to play young players. They were again traded after the 2003 season, joining the Columbus Crew, their fourth team in four seasons. They made little impact on the Crew, however, again appearing in only three games in 2004. After appearing only once in the 2005 season, Barclay was released by Columbus on November 15, 2005.
Barclay represented the U.S. national team at the Under-18, Under-20, and Under-23 levels, but their playing time with those teams dwindled as they were unable to break into an MLS side.
Stifled by the lack of playing time and hampered by injuries, Barclay retired from soccer. They began learning how to kick field goals and was able to walk on at Ohio State University. As a junior, Barclay was second on the placekicking depth chart at Ohio State until Aaron Pettrey was injured on October 31, 2009, in a game against New Mexico State. Barclay became the starting kicker going forward.
They scored the game winning kick against the Iowa Hawkeyes on November 14, 2009. The win meant that Ohio State would play in the Rose Bowl, as well as ensuring Ohio State at least a share of the 2009 Big Ten Championship.
Barclay started off the 2010 season well, tying the Ohio State record with 5 field goals on 6 attempts in week 2 against the University of Miami. They were named the Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week for their efforts. They would finish the season 20-for-24 on field goals. Barclay never missed a point after touchdown in their career as a Buckeye.
Now, Devin working at Nike as mens soccer athlete manager, before was the director of coaching at the Colorado Rush soccer team.

The Great Tang Records on the Western Regions is a narrative of Xuanzang's nineteen-year journey from Chang'an in central China to the Western Regions of Chinese historiography. The Buddhist scholar traveled through the Silk Road regions of what is today Xinjiang in northwest China, as well as neighboring areas in Central Asia and south China. Beyond these Chinese locations, Xuanzang also travelled around the perimeter of India, as far south as Kanchipuram. Xuanzang's travels demarcate not only an important place in cross-cultural studies of China and India, but also cross-cultural studies throughout the globe. The text is set up as both an account of Xuanzang's religious pilgrimage and their report of the surrounding towns and provinces of Tang China.
The book was compiled in 646, describing travels undertaken between 626 and 645. Bianji, a disciple of Xuanzang, spent more than one year editing the book through Xuanzang's dictation.
Background
While trade relations between India and China had been ongoing since 1st century CE and had been strengthened through the introduction of Buddhism into China, it was not until the expansion of the Turkic Khaganate began to threaten the borders of India and China that embassies were sent between the two regions for military alliances. Xuanzang is credited as being one of the first diplomats to establish such a relation between Tang dynasty China and the Indian empire of Kannauj.
Xuanzang's travels were motivated by their deep interest in Buddhist lore. While they were not legally authorized by the Tang court to leave China, they managed to journey to India and record their meetings with kings of various Indian kingdoms. Of particular note is emperor Harsha, whom Xuanzang managed to convince to send an emissary to Emperor Taizong of Tang. These diplomatic relations allowed Xuanzang to return to China without facing legal repercussions, instead granting them an audience with Taizong, who ultimately commissioned Xuanzang to write a record of their journeys to be entered into the official Tang records.
Overview
The book contains more than 120,000 Chinese characters and is divided into twelve volumes, which describe the geography, land and maritime transportation, climate, local products, people, language, history, politics, economic life, religion, culture, and customs in 110 countries, regions and city-states from Xinjiang to Persia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India, and Sri Lanka, among other regions.
Importance
The text is of a great value to modern historians and archaeologists. The Records is an important document of Central Asia during the early seventh century, as it provides information of a Buddhist culture existing in Afghanistan during that time and the earliest textual evidence for Buddhist sculptures at Bamiyan. Their travels are also credited with being partially responsible for the spread of sugar-making technology in medieval China and India. This is significant because sugar plays a crucial role in Buddhist doctrine. The text also has equal importance in the studies of India, and archaeologists have been using it to fill in certain gaps in Indian history. It also allowed historians to locate important sites in India. The book is known for having "exact descriptions of distances and locations of different places", and has served as a guidebook for the excavation of many important sites, such as Rajagrha, the Temple at Sarnath, Ajanta, the ruins of the Nalanda Monastery in Bihar and the ruins of Vasu Bihar of ancient Pundra City. The text inspired Journey to the West, a Chinese novel published in the Ming Dynasty.

The Four Saints of Nine Dragon Island () are characters featured within the famed classic Chinese novel Investiture of the Gods. These four individuals Wang Mo, Yang Sen, Gao Youqian, and Li Xingba; each of them are renowned as superior men. These four superior men would later be personally recruited by Grand Old Master Wen Zhong in an attempt to put an end to the threat of King Wu.
After their deaths, Jiang Ziya deified them as the gods of the "Four Saints Grand Marshal of Lingxiao Palace" (灵霄宝殿四圣大元帅).
Wang Mo
Wang Mo () is seen with a deep-blue scholarly uniform with long black hair and a pleasant complexion. Once Wang Mo arrived at the Western Foothills, they told Ziya about the three commandments and left. At a later point following their return to the Western Foothills, Wang Mo became enraged over Ziya's refusal to obey their words. Before Wang Mo could lay their sword upon Ziya, Nezha quickly jumped in the way and engaged in a duel. With Yang Sen's assistance, Wang Mo was able to once again pursue Ziya but this time within the sky.
While riding through the clouds atop their great beast, Wang Mo unleashed their Earth Slashing Pearl technique to send Ziya tumbling down to the valley below. As Wang Mo was about to finish off Ziya, they heard Superiorman Broad Altruist singing a song. Once Wang Mo approached Broad Altruist, Broad Altruist ordered Wang Mo not to kill Ziya (for they would never be able to hear the end of the Investiture of the Gods Register if they were to do so). Wang Mo, believing Broad Altruist to be cocky, charged at them with their blade; which was immediately parried by Jinzha, Broad Altruist's student. Once Broad Altruist bound Wang's throat, feet, and waist with golden bands, Jinzha beheaded Wang Mo in one swift slash of their sword — effectively putting an end to Wang Mo's life.
Yang Sen
Yang Sen () is seen in a monk-style white gown with a black face as dark as charcoal. Yang Sen also has bushy, blond hair and a braided, golden beard. Following Ziya's refusal to obey, Yang Sen teamed up with Wang Mo in battle against Nezha. If Wang Mo found any opening, Yang Sen stood ready to unleash their Sky Opening Pearl technique upon Nezha. With great skill, Yang Sen also sent the interfering Yellow Flying Tiger tumbling to the ground. Following the death of Wang Mo, Yang Sen personally vowed for revenge. The following morning, Yang Sen and their two remaining superior allies dueled it out against both Jinzha and Nezha. Yang Sen (who saw Gao Youqian killed instantly by Ziya's Devil Beating Whip), was now furious. Once Yang Sen charged at Ziya to avenge the death of their comrade, Jinzha immediately appeared and bound Yang Sen with their Seven-Treasure Golden Lotus. Yang Sen quickly fell dead after being pierced through the stomach by Jinzha's sword.
Gao Youqian
Gao Youqian () is seen with a complexion of indigo blue, two protrusive buck teeth, bright red knotted hair, and a bright royal red robe. During the first attack upon Ziya, Gao Youqian unleashed their skills against Good Lob the Lobster. When Yang Sen was being bound to death by Good Lob, Gao Youqian immediately launched themselves into the air and unleashed their Coalesce Pearl technique (a technique that instantly sent Lobster's head askew). Upon hearing of the death of Wang Mo, Gao Youqian also expressed their anguish and battled against Ziya the following morning. However, Gao Youqian was instantly struck in the head by Ziya's Devil Beating Whip, and thus died instantly.
Li Xingba
Li Xingba () was supposedly to be the strongest member of the Foursome of Nine Dragon Island. In appearance, Li Xingba had long flowing black hair and beard, a face of plum redness and a long pale yellow gown. During the first attack upon the Western Foothills, Li Xingba assisted Wang Mo against Ziya. Following the second encounter against Ziya, Li Xingba, in great anger, battled it out against both Jinzha and Nezha. With demonic fervor following the death of all three of their allies, Li Xingba now stood as a lone warrior that possessed the determination to fight to the death. Due to the sudden assistance of Zhang Cassia and Gale Woods, Li Xingba was able to retreat atop their large beast after suffering a few minor wounds. While still being pursued by Ziya, Li Xingba barely avoided death from Ziya's whip. After escaping by flying atop their beast, they arrived at a neighboring secluded hideout to plan their next move. With great inner anguish, Li Xingba spoke the words,
"How can I possibly face my other friends on the Nine Dragon Island now that the four of us have become just a little me! We each had more than a thousand years of training and study. How could we be so stupid as to get involved in such a senseless fight? I think I'd better go to see the Grand Old Master who, after all, involved us in this mess!"
Soon thereafter, Muzha, the second brother of Nezha, suddenly appeared before Li Xingba and told them of their allegiance. Li Xingba, in a fit of rage, charged at Muzha with their sword. Unfortunately, Li was soon struck down and died.

Giuseppe Garibaldi was an Italian light cruiser, that served in the Regia Marina during World War II. After the war they were retained by the Marina Militare and upgraded. They were built by CRDA, in Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard Trieste and named after the Italian general Giuseppe Garibaldi.
Decommissioned in 1953, Giuseppe Garibaldi was converted between 1957 and 1961, at the La Spezia shipyards, into a guided missile cruiser.
Design
The Duca degli Abruzzi-class cruisers were the final version of the and were larger and better protected than their predecessors. The armament was also increased by two extra 152 mm guns, triple turrets replaced twins in the "A" and "Y" positions. The machinery was also revised which led to these ships having a slightly slower maximum speed than their predecessors.
World War II service
1940
On 9 July at the Battle of Calabria, Giuseppe Garibaldi along with their sister, , fired the first rounds of the engagement. During the engagement, splinters from a 6-inch round fired by Giuseppe Garibaldi hit the British cruiser , damaging their catapult and the reconnaissance aircraft beyond repair.
On 1 September, they were part of the fleet that attempted to intercept the Hats convoy and on 29 September, Giuseppe Garibaldi and the rest of the Italian fleet made another ineffectual sortie against Operation MB 5, a successful British attempt to ressuply Malta. On 11 November, Giuseppe Garibaldi was anchored at Taranto when British aircraft attacked the Italian fleet in the harbour.
1941
On 27 March, Giuseppe Garibaldi participated in the Battle of Cape Matapan. The commander of the ship at the time was Captain Stanislao Caraciotti. On 8 May they were part of an Italian force that failed to intercept Tiger convoy. On 28 July the cruiser was torpedoed and damaged by the British submarine .
1942
On 3 January, the cruiser escorted Italian convoy M 43. On 7 March, Giuseppe Garibaldi took part in Operation V 5, escorting a large Axis convoy to Libya along with fellow Condottieri-class cruiser, . On 14 June Giuseppe Garibaldi participated in the successful action against convoy Vigorous, an attempt to resupply Malta by the Royal Navy.
After the armistice (8 September 1943), they operated in the South Atlantic together with Allied ships against potential German raiders.
As a guided missile cruiser
After the war they were retained by the Italian Navy and modernized with minor changes of the armament and a radar. They were decommissioned in 1953 and reconstructed as a guided missile cruiser.
The new ship was rebuilt in the La Spezia Arsenal starting from 1957, and, at their completion in 1961, they were named flagship of the Italian Navy. The reconstruction included a complete overhauling of the superstructure, while the hull kept its original dimensions. Apart from some minor changes, much of the latter's rebuilding included four launchers for the U.S. designed UGM-27 Polaris nuclear ballistic missiles. The US never provided the missiles. Instead the Italian government set to develop an indigenous missile, called Alfa. The propulsion system remained the same. The rest of the armament was radically altered: a RIM-2 Terrier missile launcher made Giuseppe Garibaldi the first missile cruiser in Europe. The previous artillery was replaced by four 135 mm/45 guns in two twin turrets and eight Oto Melara 76 mm/62 Type MMI AA guns. Electronics included several radars and fire control systems.
They were decommissioned in 1971 and scrapped the following year.

The men's single sculls competition at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia took place at the Sydney International Regatta Centre. It was held from 17 to 23 September. There were 24 competitors from 24 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by Rob Waddell of New Zealand, the nation's first victory in the event after bronze medals in 1920 and 1988. Defending champion Xeno Müller of Switzerland placed second, becoming the 11th man to win multiple medals in the event. Marcel Hacker of Germany took bronze; it was the 11th consecutive Games with a German rower on the podium in the event (including the United Team of Germany, East Germany, West Germany, and Germany).
Background
This was the 23rd appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls have been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.
Seven of the 21 single scullers from the 1996 Games returned: gold medallist Xeno Müller of Switzerland, silver medallist Derek Porter of Canada, fifth-place finisher (and 1992 silver medallist) Václav Chalupa of the Czech Republic, seventh-place finisher Rob Waddell of New Zealand, eighth-place finisher Ali Ibrahim of Egypt, twelfth-place finisher Sergio Fernández González of Argentina, and eighteenth-place finisher (and 1992 fifth-place finisher) Jüri Jaanson of Estonia. Müller and Waddell were the top two scullers coming into the Games; Waddell had won the last two World Championships in 1998 and 1999 with Müller the runner-up both times. Porter was another contender, with a third-place finish at the latest World Championship (he had also won that event seven years earlier). Chalupa was also a perennial contender, with four silver and two bronze medals at the World Championships in the single sculls to go along with their 1992 Olympic silver (he would add a third bronze in 2001). Other challengers included veterans Jaanson and Fernández.
Algeria, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Slovakia, and Tunisia each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 19th appearance, most among nations.
Competition format
This rowing event is a single scull event, meaning that each boat is propelled by a single rower. The "scull" portion means that the rower uses two oars, one on each side of the boat; this contrasts with sweep rowing in which each rower has one oar and rows on only one side (not feasible for singles events). The competition consists of multiple rounds. Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912.
During the first round four quarterfinal heats, each with 6 boats, were held. The winning boat in each heat advanced to the semifinals, while all others were relegated to the repechages.
The repechages offered the rowers a chance to qualify for the semi-final. Placing in the repechages determined which semifinal the boat would race in. Four heats were held, with 5 boats each. The top two boats in each repechage moved on to the A/B semifinals, with the bottom three boats going to the C/D semifinals.
Four semifinals were held, two each of A/B semifinals and C/D semifinals. For each semifinal race, the top three boats moved on to the better of the two finals, while the bottom three boats went to the lesser of the two finals possible. For example, a second-place finish in an A/B semifinal would result in advancement to the A final.
The fourth and final round was the finals. Each final determined a set of rankings. The final determined the medals, along with the rest of the places through 6th. The B final gave rankings from 7th to 12th, the C from 13th to 18th, and so on. Thus, to win a medal rowers had to finish in either the top one of their quarterfinal or top two of their repechage heat and top three of their A/B semifinal to reach the A final.

Ebe Walter Tunnell (December 31, 1844 – December 18, 1917) was an American merchant and politician from Lewes, in Sussex County, Delaware. They were a member of the Democratic Party, who served in the Delaware General Assembly and as Governor of Delaware.
Early life and family
Tunnell was born at Blackwater, Delaware, near Clarksville, now Ocean View, Sussex County, Delaware, son of Nancy J. Long and Stephen Tunnell. After attending the public schools at Milford and Lewes, they ran the Blackwater general store started by their grandfather. They moved to Lewes in 1872, and operated a drug and hardware business there and was a member of the Lewes Presbyterian Church.
They were one of two Delaware governors who never married.
Governor of Delaware
Tunnell was a member of the Delaware House of Representatives in the 1871/72 session and Clerk of the Peace for Sussex County from 1885 through 1890. They were the unsuccessful Democratic Party candidate for Governor of Delaware in 1894, losing to the Republican Party candidate, Joshua H. Marvil. Two years later, in 1896, they were elected governor, defeating the Union (Addicks) Republican Party candidate, James R. Hoffecker, and the regular Republican Party candidate John C. Higgins. They served one term as governor from January 19, 1897, until January 15, 1901.
The Delaware Constitution of 1897, the state's constitution, was written and adopted during their term. It added some representation for New Castle County in the Delaware General Assembly, but reduced the representation of Wilmington, which was already the state's most populous part. Among many other changes, it created the office of Lieutenant Governor, allowed governors to be elected to a second term and gave them a legislative veto, reduced judges' terms from life to 12 years, and eliminated the poll tax. It was also during their term that the General Incorporation Law was passed, creating the favorable business environment that has resulted in Delaware becoming the preferred place in the U.S. for companies to incorporate.
Death and legacy
After their term ended, Tunnell returned to Lewes, where they became president of the Farmers' Bank of Delaware, a director of the Delaware, Maryland and Virginia Railroad, and owner of the Delaware Pilot. They died at Lewes, and is buried there in the Lewes Presbyterian Church cemetery.
Almanac
Elections are held the first Tuesday after November 1. Members of the Delaware General Assembly took office the first Tuesday of January. State representatives have a two-year term. The governor takes office the third Tuesday of January and has a four-year term.

Despot S. Badžović (, ) (1850 — 30 November 1930) was a teacher and an activist of the Serbian national movement in Macedonia. Badžović was also one of the early Macedonists, who developed some kind of pro-Serbian Slav Macedonian identity.
Teacher in Kruševo
Despot Badžović and their brother Đorđe graduated at the Second Department of the Belgrade Orthodox Seminary founded by Miloš Milojević. In 1871 Badžović opened a Serbian school in Kruševo for about 60 students where they and their brother Đorđe were the first teachers. Đorđe left the school in 1875 to become a teacher in Smilevo, and Despot left in 1876 to live in Serbia. Their brother Kuzman and their wife, Jelena Badžović, replaced them as teachers.
Move to Serbia
During the Serbian-Ottoman War Badžović distinguished themselves by mobilizing volunteers who illegally crossed the Ottoman-Serbian border to join Serbian forces and as a company commander. After the war ended in February 1877, Despot became a scribe in the Pčinja District.
On 20 May 1877 Badžović was in the delegation of “Serbs of Old Serbia" who asked the government of Serbia to liberate and unite Old Serbia with the Principality of Serbia. They also informed representatives of the Great Powers and the Emperor of Russia of their demands. In the same year Badžović became a member of the Committee for the Liberation of Old Serbia and Macedonia.
On 20 May 1879 Badžović suggested to the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs that Serbian forces should enter Macedonia to incite rebellion against the Ottomans.
Primers
At the end of 1879, with approval of Matija Ban, Badžović published the 'Alphabet Textook for Serbo-Macedonian Primary Schools' () written on "Serbo-Macedonian dialect". Matija Ban proposed to the government of the Principality of Serbia to establish the Main Board with eight members who would maintain the connection with smaller sub boards in smaller places in the Old Serbia and Macedonia. Minister of Education Vladan Đorđević engaged Badžović to participate in composing of the alphabet book for the Serbian Schools in Macedonia. They adapted their earlier alphabet book and sent it to the Ministry of Education of Serbia under a new name 'Alphabet book for Macedonian Schools in Turkish Empire' ().

Abdul Haq is a Muslim cleric and Pakistani politician.  They are among the leaders of the Bharchundi Shareef Dargah, and a locally influential figure. Haq was elected to the National Assembly of Pakistan from Constituency NA-200 (Ghotki-I) as a candidate of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) in 2008 Pakistani general election. They received 59,022 votes and defeated Khalid Ahmed Khan Lund, a candidate of the Pakistan Muslim League (Q) (PML-Q).
Haq has been criticized for their alleged role in forcibly converting Hindus, including minors, to Islam. Haq has been the target of protests against these alleged conversions. They became the subject of media attention in 2012 after the high-profile case of Rinkle Kumari, a Hindu woman who converted to Islam in the Bharchundi Shareef Dargah. Members of the Hindu community stated that they had been kidnapped and converted against their will, and that Haq had sheltered their kidnappers and threatened them into saying they had chosen to convert.
Following their alleged involvement in the case, the PPP selected a different candidate to contest the 2013 Pakistani general election.

Nathan Joseph Fielder (born May 12, 1983) is a Canadian comedian, actor, writer, director, producer, and entrepreneur.  They are best known for co-creating, directing, and starring in the Comedy Central parody reality show Nathan for You (2013–2017) and the HBO docu-comedy The Rehearsal (2022–present), and executive producing How To with John Wilson (2020–present).
Early life
Nathan Joseph Fielder was born into a Jewish family in Vancouver on May 12, 1983, the son of social workers Deb and Eric Fielder. They attended Point Grey Secondary School, where they were a member of the school's improv comedy group, which also included comedian Seth Rogen. They worked as a magician during their teenage years and is a member of The Magic Castle. They studied business at the University of Victoria, where they graduated with a BComm in 2005. After university, they moved to Toronto and enrolled in Humber College's Comedy Program in 2006. They worked briefly for a brokerage firm before quitting to start their comedy career.
Career
After receiving the Tim Sims Encouragement Fund Award in 2006, Fielder worked as a writer on Canadian Idol, where they were noticed by Michael Donovan, an executive producer for the CBC comedy series This Hour Has 22 Minutes. Donovan hired Fielder as a field correspondent, and developed their popular recurring segment, "Nathan on Your Side". In 2010, Fielder wrote and directed a number of sketches for Season 2 of Important Things with Demetri Martin on Comedy Central. They were also featured as a guest voice actor on the Season 2 finale of Bob's Burgers, "Beefsquatch", as well as the Season 6 episode, "The Land Ship". Fielder played the role of Jon Benjamin's boom operator in the 2011 television series Jon Benjamin Has a Van, and played Bob Woodward in the "Washington, DC" episode of Comedy Central's Drunk History. Fielder has also guest-starred on the Adult Swim show Rick and Morty. They appeared in the 2015 film The Night Before and the 2017 biopic The Disaster Artist. Fielder also has a YouTube channel, mainly comprising short sketches involving them and their friends.
In 2013, Fielder co-created their own show on Comedy Central called Nathan for You. The show, which they wrote, directed, and starred in, was based on the "Nathan On Your Side" segments that they did for This Hour Has 22 Minutes. The show's premise features Fielder, playing a persona loosely based on himself, providing advice for local small businesses. In November 2017, the show finished its fourth and final season.
On the morning of February 7, 2014, a coffee shop called Dumb Starbucks Coffee opened in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles. The shop stated that they were operating as a parody of the global coffee company and coffeehouse chain Starbucks and utilized the chain's siren logo in their signage, cups, and other materials. The shop mocked items standard to most Starbucks' locations such as Norah Jones CDs and drinks by using the term "Dumb" in front of the names, such as "Dumb Norah Jones Duets" and "Dumb Iced Vanilla Latte". Beverages and pastries were distributed free of charge. A few days later, Starbucks announced that they were not affiliated with the shop and that they were "evaluating [their] next steps" due to the shop deliberately attempting to mimic the look of a legitimate Starbucks location.
The identity of the person behind the shop was not released initially, and various artists and comedians such as Banksy and Tim & Eric were theorized to be involved with the prank (the latter's production company Abso Lutely Productions had applied for a filming permit at the Dumb Starbucks Coffee location). On February 10, 2014, the shop was closed by the Los Angeles County Health Department for not having the permits required to operate a coffee shop. Shortly thereafter, Fielder announced that they were behind the parody and the Los Angeles Times noted the prank's similarity to other skits performed on Fielder's show Nathan for You.
Fielder started a not-for-profit company called Summit Ice Apparel in 2015, after learning that the Vancouver-based company Taiga posted a tribute to Holocaust denier Doug Collins. They decided to start their own company and produce soft shell jackets. This endeavor was shown during Season 3 of Nathan for You. 100% of Summit Ice Apparel's profits go to the Vancouver Holocaust Education Centre in Vancouver. The company had close to $500,000 in sales in the first three months. In March 2017, they opened up a pop-up shop in Vancouver where members of the public could buy Summit Ice Apparel or exchange their Taiga jacket for a Summit Ice jacket. Fielder themselves worked the register. A film crew was also on-site.
In 2019, it was announced that Fielder had signed an overall deal with HBO, under which they will serve as executive producer for the documentary series How To with John Wilson and will star, write, and direct in a separate comedy series. In 2020, Showtime picked up the comedy series The Curse, created and written by Fielder and filmmaker Benny Safdie, and starring Fielder, Safdie, and Emma Stone. In 2021, HBO announced the name of another new comedy series, The Rehearsal, which Fielder will write, direct, executive produce, and star in. The official description accompanying the announcement described that, in the series, Fielder "gives people the opportunity to rehearse for their own lives."
Personal life
Fielder was married to a children's librarian from 2011 until their divorce in 2014.  They are incorrectly listed as female on their U.S. green card. They live in Silver Lake, Los Angeles.

A hot quadrate sign is an imaging appearance of increased enhancement in CT scans or MRI, or radiotracer accumulation in nuclear medicine, in which there is enhancement of the quadrate lobe of the liver. The appearance is an indirect reflection of the collateralized flow of SVC syndrome, in which occlusion of the superior vena cava leads to preferential flow to the quadrate.
The sign is similar in mechanism but distinct in significance from the hot caudate sign, in which the caudate lobe of the liver shows preferential enhancement or radiotracer accumulation with hepatic vein occlusion in Budd Chiari syndrome. In the latter, the caudate shows preferential flow because its direct drainage into the inferior vena cava remains unobstructed, as opposed to the remnant liver which drains into the hepatic vein.

Griswoldville is an unincorporated community in Jones County, in the U.S. state of Georgia. Griswoldville is located about ten miles east of Macon.
History
A post office called Griswoldville was established in 1849, and remained in operation until 1928. Variant names are "Griswold" and "Griswoldsville".
The community was founded as an industrial site/company town by, and named for, Samuel Griswold, proprietor of a local cotton mill. In addition to their three-story, 24-room mansion, Griswold built a church, slave and workers quarters, expanded their cotton gin factory (which later produced firearms), a saw mill, a grist mill, brickworks, and factories that made furniture, candles, soap, and other products.
The town was largely destroyed at the Battle of Griswoldville in 1864 during the American Civil War.

Nýmphaion (, ), also known as Nymphaion on the Pontus (), was a significant centre of the Bosporan Kingdom, situated on the Crimean shore of the Cimmerian Bosporus. Today it is located near the resort town Heroivske/Geroevskoye. It lies at a distance of about 14 kilometers south of Kerch, which was the site of ancient Panticapaeum.
Geography
The ruins of Nymphaion stand on a rocky cape approximately 200 meters west of the shoreline. Centuries of coastal erosion caused the shoreline to recede. The ancient shoreline would have been some 300 meters further east.
Today the ruins are bordered by the Čurubaš Lake to the north and the Tobečik Lake to the south. In ancient times both of these lakes were ravines with sea gulfs at their mouths in the east. These ravines were situated 7 kilometers apart. They enclosed a territory of more than 40 square kilometers further west, where a rocky ridge of steep hills bordered the area on the west.
These natural borders made the territory of Nymphaion more easily defendable. In addition, it is well suited to agriculture thanks to its fertile chernozem soil. It also receives 100 millimeters more rainfall than surrounding land.
History
The city was founded by Greek colonists from Samos between 580 and 560 BC. There is no archaeological evidence for the presence of Scythians in the area before the city's founding. The town issued its own coins and generally prospered in the period of classical antiquity, when its citizens controlled cereal trade, which was vital for the well-being of mainland Greece. Athens chose it as its principal military base in the region ca. 444 BC and Gylon, the grandfather of Demosthenes, suffered banishment from Athens on charges that they had betrayed Nymphaeum during the Peloponnesian War. It was annexed to the Bosporan Kingdom by the end of the century.
During the Mithridatic Wars, the town allied with the Roman Republic and withstood a siege by the army of Pharnaces II of Pontus. It was at Phanagoria that the insurrection broke out against Mithridates VI of Pontus, shortly before their death; and their sons, who held the citadel, were obliged to surrender to the insurgents. An inscription found during excavations testifies that queen Dynamis honored Augustus as "the emperor, Caesar, son of god, the god Augustus, the overseer of every land and sea". The loyalty to Rome allowed Phanagoria to maintain a dominant position in the region until the 4th century, when it was sacked and destroyed by the invading Huns.
The site occupied a small hill by the sea. The acropolis contained the temples of Aphrodite (with several rooms) and of the Cabeiri. The lower terrace by the sea centred on the sanctuary of Demeter, first erected in the 6th century BC and several times rebuilt. Other ruins indicate that the town's architecture was unusually refined, perhaps the most sophisticated in the Bosporan Kingdom. One structure has no parallels in the Hellenistic world: it goes back to the 3rd century BC and is built of rose marl. The site also yielded a number of terracotta figurines, winemaking facilities (the oldest along the northern shore of the Black Sea) and several horse burials, associated with the Sarmatians.

Broersen and Lukács is an artist duo living and working in Amsterdam and is formed by Persijn Broersen (Delft, 1974) and Margit Lukács (Amsterdam, 1973). They have been working together since 2001 making mostly video-art and video-art installations using various mediums such as photography, video and animation. Central to their artworks is the relationship between individuals and their environments, both nature and society, and how this is influenced by the current, media based society. Their works have been part of numerous exhibitions but have also been shown on festivals, for example IFFR and Lowlands festival. Several of their works can also be found in the collection of the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam and the Akzo Nobel Art Foundation.
They are represented by Akinci, based in Amsterdam.
Education and residencies
Both Broersen and Lukács started their artistic education at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam, where they studied graphic design from 1994 to 1998. They continued studying Fine Arts and Design at the Sandberg Institute from 1998 to 2001. After residencies at the Chinese European Art Center (Xiamen, China) in 2002 and Iaspis (Stockholm, Sweden) in 2006 they enrolled in a two-year residency at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam from 2007 to 2008.
They returned to the Chinese European Art Centre in 2010 after which they came back to Europe residing in the Atelier Holsboer (Paris, France) between 2011 and 2012. In 2017, they were residents at the Künstlerhaus Bethanien (Berlin, Germany).
Selected works
Crossing the Rainbow Bridge (2003)
Crossing the Rainbow Bridge'''' is a two-channel video showing two young people who appear to be a couple, played by Broersen and Lukács themselves. The two are shown in separate environments expressing their thoughts, sometimes coming together in song or though. The video was described by Lex ter Braak as "making things visible and tangible" because of the visualization of connections that seem incomprehensible. The sentimental feel of the video is enhanced by the accompanying music by indie-pop band Bauer.
The Broersen Family (2006) and Raise High the Roof Beam (2007)
For these video's Broersen and Lukács delved into their own family's history. They can be displayed separately or as a combined installation. The Broersen Family is set in the small town of Nieuw Niedorp, where Pepijn Broersen is originally from, and shows the lives of the Broersen family in a four-channel video. Though fictional, the shots are made to look like documentary footage of a town that is slowly influenced by consequences of globalization. Complementing but also responding to this is the work Raise High the Roof Beam, focused around the Jewish-Hungarian roots of Margit Lukács' family. Contrary to the story of Broersen, their family has spread around the world, having no clear origins. With these works, they question to what extent identities are formed by previous generations and family history.
Manifest Destiny (2008/2009) Manifest Destiny was made during Broersen and Lukács' final year at the Rijksakademie and tells the story of a scientist on the lookout for life on other planets. The video shows the barren landscape of an imaginary planet while hearing the scientist speak about their ongoing investigations. Slowly, it becomes clear that the scientist is a somewhat lonely soul, in need of social contact in their direct environment while at the same time longing for the unknown world on other planets. The story is based on interviews conducted by Broersen and Lukács with researchers and scholars on the topic of extraterrestrial space. The shots used in the video are inspired by the representation of space in both documentaries and science-fiction, showing "the proximity of reality and fiction that are inevitably found when the explorer is led by a longing for a new reality".
Mastering Bambi (2010)
Instead of a human or animal as protagonist, nature plays the leading role in Mastering Bambi. Broersen and Lukács built on the idea that the Disney film Bambi can also be interpreted as a metaphor for human society as the sole thread of nature. The spectator is taken through scenes of an empty forest that the artist have created by layering real photographs. Because of the movement and focus of the 'camera' the work has been interpreted as being intimate and private. The video is accompanied by a soundtrack created by Berend Dubbe and Gwendolyn Thomas, who have distorted the original movie soundtrack.
Ruins in Reverse (2014) Ruins in Reverse is a 56 meter print made for the escalator area at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam and was part of the exhibition 'On the Move'. When standing on the escalator, the visitor is transported past a landscape full of buildings and cities. The image was built up using different scenes from sci-fi movies that depict the future. By exploring these past depictions of the future, the artists wanted to show how the idea of the future in popular media can change with time and can be linked to certain ideologies. The soundtrack was made by Natalia Domínguez Rangel.
Establishing Eden (2016)
Set to a soundtrack by Berend Dubbe and Gwendolyn Thomas, the single-channel video Establishing Eden is based around the so-called 'establishing shot' used to set a scene in movies. The video is made by layering photographs, the same technique as used to make Mastering Bambi, creating scenes that can be seen as a whole or, when the 'camera' moves, are split apart. The photographs in the video are of the landscapes used as filming locations for The Lord of the Rings series in New-Zealand. With these shots, Broersen and Lukács want to show how nature can inspire movies, but also how these movies in return have changed the way the landscapes are viewed (for example the renaming of various sites).
Forest on Location (2018)
Broersen and Lukács continue using their layered photographs to form the video Forest on Location,'' this time introducing an animated figure to the scenes. The scenes are made using 3D-photo's from the old growth forest of Białowieża in Poland. A slight difference in technique causes the photo's to produce 3D scenes of the forest that aren't screen filling but rather appear to be floating in space. An animated avatar of the Iranian opera singer Shahram Yazdani can be seen walking through the woods, singing a Persian version of Nat King Cole's Nature Boy. The song is chosen because of its relation to Herman Yablokoff, a songwriter who claims to have written it and lived close to the forest. The work was part of a three piece installation called 'Point Cloud Old Growth' in foam Amsterdam and was described by curator Mirjam Kooiman as follows: "Broersen and Lukács take nature as a phenomenon from which humankind is perhaps more alienated than anything else today, and investigate the visual framework that we repeatedly project onto it as a means to capture it, to give it meaning, or as a vain attempt to understand it.".

The Bear Brook Watershed in Maine (BBWM) is an experimental forest operated by the University of Maine in Hancock County, Maine, United States. The BBWM focuses around the two small first order branches of Bear Brook on the southeastern slopes of Lead Mountain above Bear Pond. Two years of monitoring studies began in 1987, after which the two watersheds of East and West Bear Brook were determined to be nearly identical. The West Bear Brook watershed was experimentally acidified with ammonium sulfate every other month from November 1989 until August 2016 to study the effects of sulfur and nitrogen acid deposition. East Bear Brook has been used as an untreated reference. Related research topics at BBWM include climate change, carbon sequestration, base cation depletion, and watershed biogeochemistry. There are two USGS stream gauges on the East and West Branches of Bear Brook.

Zhu Yujian (; 1602 – 6 October 1646), nickname Changshou (長壽), originally the Prince of Tang, later reigned as the Longwu Emperor () of the Southern Ming from 18 August 1645, when they were enthroned in Fuzhou, to 6 October 1646, when they were captured and executed by a contingent of the Qing army. They were an eighth generation descendant of Zhu Jing, Prince Ding of Tang, who was the 23rd son of Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang (Hongwu Emperor).
Early life
Before ascending to the throne, they followed their father as the Prince of Tang, their fief being situated in Nanyang prefecture, in Henan province. In 1636, they were stripped of their title by the Chongzhen Emperor and put under house arrest in Fengyang. Their former title was transferred to their younger brother Zhu Yumo (). In 1641, the latter committed suicide when Li Zicheng invaded Nanyang. After the death of the Chongzhen Emperor 1644, their successor on the Ming throne, the Hongguang Emperor, released the Prince of Tang from their arrest.
Reign
When Qing forces captured Nanjing in June 1645, they fled to Hangzhou. However, when Hangzhou fell to the Qing on 6 July 1645, the Prince of Tang managed to escape by land to the southeastern province of Fujian.
In August of the same year, at the behest of several high officials, they ascended to the Ming throne in Fuzhou, taking the reign title Longwu (隆武; pinyin: Lóngwǔ). Their era name means "plentiful and martial". After a promising start, Fujian's geographical position on the margin of the empire, cut off from the heartland by several mountain ranges, as well as their lack of effective troops and the failure on part of the officialdom to find a united stance doomed the Longwu government. When Qing forces invaded Fujian in the late summer of 1646, Zheng Zhilong, the emperor's strongest ally, surrendered while their son Zheng Chenggong (the famous Koxinga) retreated to the sea.
The Prince of Tang was left with a dwindling court. On 6 October 1646, they were captured and immediately executed.
Personality
Against the Ming policy of keeping imperial princes out of politics, the Prince of Tang early on showed interest in the government of the empire and strove for a larger role of the princes in it. Their initiatives had brought them under house arrest during the reign of the Chongzhen Emperor, but their knowledge of history and of Ming institutions, paired with a diligent personality, made them take their imperial role seriously.
Zhu Yujian is said to have had a very close relationship with their wife, who had shared their hardship when they were incarcerated. Contrary to Chinese custom, they steadfastly declined to take any concubines.

The Ancient Noble Order of the Gormogons was a short-lived 18th century secret society formed by expelled Freemason Philip Wharton. It left no records or accomplishments to indicate its true goal and purpose. From the group's few published articles it is thought that the society's primary objective was to hold up Freemasonry to ridicule. During its brief existence it was accused of being a Jacobite-leaning group, perhaps because the first known Grandmaster (or Oecumenical Volgi) was Andrew Michael Ramsay of Ayr, Scotland, a Jacobite of strong convictions. It also appears to have been a charitable organization, at least according to its surviving bylaws. There are also some surviving pendant badges, bearing their sign.
Possible etymology of the name
Jonathon Green suggests in Cassell's Dictionary of Slang that, in the form gormagon, the word is a blend of gorgon and dragon, while the Oxford English Dictionary describes the etymology as "meaningless: pseudo Chinese."
In The 1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, the word gormagon was humorously defined thus: "A monster with six eyes, three mouths, four arms, eight legs, five on one side and three on the other, three arses, two tarses [penises], and a **** upon its back." The compiler Francis Grose gave the game away in their dictionary entry by explaining that it was "a man on horseback, with a woman behind him". (His "five legs on one side" description could be merely that the woman was riding side-saddle).
One of the earliest references to the Gormogons was a September 3, 1724 entry in The London Post, which stated that it was founded by a certain Chin-Qua Ky-Po, who was claimed to be the first emperor of China, many thousand years before Adam. In this entry, the order was said to have been brought to London by a "Mandarin", who in turn initiated several "Gentlemen of Honor" into its ranks. Scholars offer differing accounts as to when this order became extinct. For instance, it was proposed that it ended in 1738. Another account maintained that it survived until 1799, when an Act was passed in July 12th of that year suppressing all secret societies with the exemption of Freemasonry.
In popular culture
The Gormogons have been referenced in the TV show Bones. Beginning with the season 3 premiere, "The Widow's Son in the Windshield", the Jeffersonian team investigated a cannibalistic serial killer they call Gormogon, for their obsession with secret societies and their targeting of the Knights of Columbus.

Heinrich Troeger (4 March 1901, in Zeitz – 28 August 1975, in Bad Nauheim) was a German jurist and politician (SPD).
Life and career
Troeger was born the son of a medical officer of health (Kreismedizinalrat). After obtaining their Abitur, they studied law and political science at Breslau, Würzburg and Halle and earned a doctoral degree in law in 1922. In 1925 they were a government assessor at the district administration offices in Euskirchen and Dortmund.

After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, they were relieved of their political offices and from 1934 to 1945 they worked as a lawyer specializing in foreign exchange and tax law in Berlin, ending with the title of officer of administrative law (Verwaltungsrechtsrat).
After World War II, Troeger briefly served as mayor of Jena (1945–1946). Shortly afterwards they moved to West Germany and settled in Hesse. In 1947 they were appointed Assistant Secretary in the Ministry of Finance of Hesse, and served from 1947 until 1949 as Secretary-General of the Council of the Bizone. In 1950-51 they served as Assistant Secretary in the Ministry of Finance for North Rhine-Westphalia under deputy minister Heinrich Weitz and was also a member of various supervisory boards.
From 10 January 1951 until 26 September 1956, Troeger served as Minister of Finance for the state of Hesse under premier Georg August Zinn. They were elected to the Hesse parliament in 1954 and retained their position until their resignation on 3 February 1958.
In 1956–57 Troeger was president of the Hesse Central Bank and in 1958–1969 was Vice President of the Deutsche Bundesbank. During this time, they initiated an eponymous commission on the Reform of the Financial Condition.

The 1951 Auburn Tigers football team represented Auburn University in the 1951 college football season. It was the Tigers' 60th overall and 19th season as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The team was led by head coach Ralph "Shug" Jordan, in their first year, and played their home games at Cliff Hare Stadium in Auburn, Cramton Bowl in Montgomery and Ladd Memorial Stadium in Mobile, Alabama. They finished with a record of five wins and five losses (5–5 overall, 3–4 in the SEC).

Season Summary
Vanderbilt
Auburn upset the 14-point favorite Commodores behind opportunistic defense and a bruising ground game. The Tigers recovered three fumbles in Vanderbilt territory and converted center Homer Williams rumbled for 122 yards on 29 carries. They scored the go-ahead touchdown with 6 minutes left in the 4th quarter and a 36-yard field goal from Joe Davis iced it with less than a minute left. Tailback Charles Hattaway racked up 120 yards on 24 carries and nose guard Bill Turnbeaugh made a few key defensive plays in the 4th quarter.
Wofford
Looking to erase the embarrassment of the previous year's loss to the hands of Wofford, Shug's Tigers were able to get revenge on the feisty Terriers by a 30-14 margin. The defense, led by Vince Dooley, took advantage of several Wofford mishaps, even with allowing Terrier quarterback Jack Beeler to complete 23 of 30 passes against them. Punter Dudley Spence was magnificent, pinning the visitors deep with every kick, and first-year student Bobby Freeman made an impressive 79-yard touchdown jaunt to break the game open.
Florida
The Homecoming battle with Florida proved to be one of the most exciting contests of the season. The Gators struck first with a blocked punt to set up a touchdown and Auburn responded with an interception that led to an Allan Parks score just before half. With the score knotted at 7 apiece, the Tigers were forced to a 3-n-out to begin the second half. With the benefit of a 12-yard punt, the visitors promptly took advantage by engineering a three-play scoring drive. The point after sailed wide, but the Gators had amassed a 13-7 lead. The game was a seesaw affair from here out, with multiple fumbles direly costing Florida chances to put the contest away. With time dwindling in the final quarter, 137-pound Tiger defensive back Jack Creel proved to be the giant of the day by blocking a Florida punt at the Gator 29-yard line. It was big Bill Turnebaugh who corralled the pigskin to give Auburn possession. Despite the fortunate shift of momentum, the home team could only manage 5 yards on their first 3 attempts. With a minute left to play, Auburn faced a 4th down-and-5 at the 24-yard line with the game on the line. Quarterback Allan Parks took the snap from center, rolled out of the pocket, and heaved a pass to end Lee Hayley who was streaking up the sidelines. Hayley leaped for the ball and came down with it in the end zone. Joe Davis's kick was true and the Tigers held on to clip Florida, 14-13.

The United Labour Party was a minor political party in Northern Ireland.
The party was founded in June 1978 by Paddy Devlin, formerly of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), and a group of former Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP) members, including John Coulthard and Bob Kidd. Devlin had been expelled from the SDLP after accusing it of no longer being socialist, while the party viewed the NILP as having become sectarian.
The party held that the partition of Ireland could only be ended if endorsed by the majority of people in Northern Ireland, and called for legal changes to reduce the power of any future Northern Ireland Executive. It described its long-term aim as the establishment of a democratic socialist government in Northern Ireland, and aimed to achieve this through working with other labour groups throughout the British Isles, including the British Labour Party and Irish Labour Party.
Devlin stood as a United Labour Party candidate in the 1979 European Parliament election but polled just 6,122 first preferences (1.1% of those cast) and thereby lost their deposit. In the same year, Kidd stood for the party in South Antrim at the UK general election, winning 2.6% of the votes. The party's only other contest was Brian Caul, who stood in the 1982 Belfast South by-election, winning just 0.7% of the votes cast.
In 1987, the group joined with the NILP and other small groups to form the Labour '87 coalition.

The Treaty of Hamburg (German - Hamburger Vergleich or Hamburger Erbvergleich) was a dynastic house law of the House of Mecklenburg. Heavily influenced by representatives of the Lower Saxon Circle, it was agreed on 8 March 1701 in neutral Hamburg. It ended the dispute over the inheritance of the Mecklenburg-Güstrow caused by the death of Gustav Adolph, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow without a male successor in 1695 and established the duchies of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Mecklenburg-Schwerin.

The Shvab–Zeldovich formulation is an approach to remove the chemical-source terms from the conservation equations for energy and chemical species by linear combinations of independent variables, when the conservation equations are expressed in a common form. Expressing conservation equations in common form often limits the range of applicability of the formulation. The method was first introduced by V. A. Shvab in 1948 and by Yakov Zeldovich in 1949.
Method
For simplicity, assume combustion takes place in a single global irreversible reaction
where is the ith chemical species of the total species and and are the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants and products, respectively. Then, it can be shown from the law of mass action that the rate of moles produced per unit volume of any species is constant and given by
where is the mass of species i produced or consumed per unit volume and is the molecular weight of species i.
The main approximation involved in Shvab–Zeldovich formulation is that all binary diffusion coefficients of all pairs of species are the same and equal to the thermal diffusivity. In other words, Lewis number of all species are constant and equal to one. This puts a limitation on the range of applicability of the formulation since in reality, except for methane, ethylene, oxygen and some other reactants, Lewis numbers vary significantly from unity. The steady, low Mach number conservation equations for the species and energy in terms of the rescaled independent variables
where is the mass fraction of species i, is the specific heat at constant pressure of the mixture, is the temperature and is the formation enthalpy of species i, reduce to
where is the gas density and is the flow velocity. The above set of nonlinear equations, expressed in a common form, can be replaced with linear equations and one nonlinear equation. Suppose the nonlinear equation corresponds to so that
then by defining the linear combinations and with , the remaining governing equations required become
The linear combinations automatically remove the nonlinear reaction term in the above equations.
Shvab–Zeldovich–Liñán formulation
Shvab–Zeldovich–Liñán formulation was introduced by Amable Liñán in 1991 for diffusion-flame problems where the chemical time scale is infinitely small (Burke–Schumann limit) so that the flame appears as a thin reaction sheet. The reactants can have Lewis number that is not necessarily equal to one.
Suppose the non-dimensional scalar equations for fuel mass fraction (defined such that it takes a unit value in the fuel stream), oxidizer mass fraction (defined such that it takes a unit value in the oxidizer stream) and non-dimensional temperature (measured in units of oxidizer-stream temperature) are given by
where is the reaction rate, is the appropriate Damköhler number, is the mass of oxidizer stream required to burn unit mass of fuel stream, is the non-dimensional amount of heat released per unit mass of fuel stream burnt and is the Arrhenius exponent. Here, and are the Lewis number of the fuel and oxygen, respectively and is the thermal diffusivity. In the Burke–Schumann limit, leading to the equilibrium condition
.
In this case, the reaction terms on the right-hand side become Dirac delta functions. To solve this problem, Liñán introduced the following functions
where , is the fuel-stream temperature and is the adiabatic flame temperature, both measured in units of oxidizer-stream temperature. Introducing these functions reduces the governing equations to
where is the mean (or, effective) Lewis number. The relationship between and and between and can be derived from the equilibrium condition.
At the stoichiometric surface (the flame surface), both and are equal to zero, leading to , , and , where is the flame temperature (measured in units of oxidizer-stream temperature) that is, in general, not equal to unless . On the fuel stream, since , we have . Similarly, on the oxidizer stream, since , we have .
The equilibrium condition defines
The above relations define the piecewise function
where is a mean Lewis number. This leads to a nonlinear equation for . Since is only a function of and , the above expressions can be used to define the function
With appropriate boundary conditions for , the problem can be solved.
It can be shown that and are conserved scalars, that is, their derivatives are continuous when crossing the reaction sheet, whereas and have gradient jumps across the flame sheet.

Bingham McCutchen LLP was a global law firm with approximately 850 attorneys in nine US offices and five international offices. It ceased operations in late 2014, when several hundred of its partners and associate lawyers left the firm to join Philadelphia-based Morgan Lewis.
History
Bingham, Dana & Gould was founded in Boston in 1891.
From 1997, the company experienced sharp growth in the number of attorneys, offices, and revenues by absorbing other law firms. In 1997, Bingham Dana acquired the 30-lawyer Japanese practice group of Marks & Murase, giving the firm offices in New York and Los Angeles and a strong base of Japanese institutional clients. The next outpost was established in Hartford through a merger with 55-lawyer Hebb & Gitlin, a firm that concentrated on international bankruptcy work. In 2001, Bingham Dana bulked up in New York City through a merger with Richards & O'Neill, a boutique law firm of 55 attorneys known for its litigation and corporate groups. The next year, in 2002, Bingham Dana merged with San Francisco-based law firm McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen to form 800-lawyer Bingham McCutchen. McCutchen Doyle brought five offices and a litigation and intellectual property focus. In 2003, the firm expanded in Southern California by merging with corporate boutique Riordan & McKinzie. 2006 saw a merger between Bingham McCutchen and Swidler Berlin Shereff Friedman, a Washington, D.C.-based firm which brought greater capabilities in the nation's capital as well as a regulatory group. Bingham also launched in Hong Kong that same year. In 2007, the firm acquired Los Angeles litigation shop Alschuler Grossman. In July 2009, Bingham McCutchen acquired McKee Nelson, a midsize law firm specializing in tax law and structured finance.
A team of Bingham attorneys and staff, led by Susan Baker Manning and Sabin Willett, represented pro bono a dozen Uighur men held in extrajudicial detention in the United States Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba.
Bingham litigated much habeas corpus cases on behalf of the Uighur clients, as well as cases under the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 that brought to light evidentiary and procedural flaws in the 2004-05 Combatant Status Review Tribunals that were used to justify the Uighurs' ongoing imprisonment. All Bingham clients were subsequently released.
The Tokyo office of Bingham McCutchen became one of the largest law firms in Japan by its 2007 merger with a domestic law firm headed by Hideyuki Sakai, an insolvency specialist. Unlike most foreign firms in Japan which have minimal domestic practices, Bingham's Tokyo office was predominantly staffed by Japanese attorneys and handled domestic matters such as the restructuring of Olympus Corporation, though it hired a number of foreign attorneys since 2012 in an attempt to strengthen its outbound and cross-border practice and to expand in other legal fields such as intellectual property and investment funds.
Despite a deep recession which hurt law firms nationwide, the Boston Globe reported that Bingham performed very well financially. In 2009, Bingham's gross revenues increased 12% and profits per partner increased 2%. Chairman Jay Zimmerman was quoted as saying "We've had our best year ever." However, despite an increase in revenues, Bingham froze salaries, and in March 2009 laid off 16 attorneys and 29 support staff.
Collapse
Bingham experienced internal tensions following the 2002 McCutchen merger, and again following the 2009 McKee merger. Both transactions were viewed as "mergers of equals" among some insiders, and as unequal acquisitions among others. The McKee transaction involved large compensation guarantees to several key McKee partners which were not immediately disclosed to other Bingham partners. The legacy McKee partners continued to earn relatively high compensation following the acquisition due to the fact that they charged higher hourly rates than the legacy Bingham partners; the legacy Bingham partners nonetheless demanded salary matching, which strained the profits of the firm.
Bingham experienced a massive downsizing from 2012 to 2014, during which time it cut 225 lawyers and saw more than 50 partners leave the firm. Two major cases—the Deepwater Horizon litigation and an IP dispute involving Oracle Corporation—ended abruptly, reducing the firm's revenue. Bingham attempted to cut costs by moving back office functions to a new center in Kentucky, but the initial cost of the move (about $100,000 per equity partner) hurt the firm's 2014 financial results even further. After Bingham's collapse, it was revealed that Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance stopped working with Bingham due to the low level of racial diversity among its partners in its Boston and Hartford offices.
In November 2014, 227 of around 300 partners and a similar number of associates joined the Philadelphia-based firm of Morgan Lewis & Bockius. Morgan Lewis paid off Bingham's debt as part of the deal, and shut down Bingham's Kentucky operations center, relocating some employees to Philadelphia.
Bingham's London and Frankfurt offices joined Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld. 50 of Bingham's 60 lawyers in Tokyo moved to the Japanese law firm of Anderson Mori & Tomotsune, with the remainder joining Morgan Lewis.
Offices
As of 2014, Bingham McCutchen had offices in Beijing, Boston, Hartford, Hong Kong, Lexington, London, Los Angeles, New York, Orange County, San Francisco, Santa Monica, California, Silicon Valley, Tokyo, and Washington, D.C. It also offered consulting services through subsidiaries Bingham Consulting and Bingham Strategic Advisors.

Religion in Louisville, Kentucky, includes religious institutions of various faiths; including Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism.
Christianity
Roman Catholic Church
There are 135,421 Roman Catholic Louisvillians who are part of the Archdiocese of Louisville, covering 24 counties in central Kentucky, and consisting of 121 parishes and missions spread over . The Cathedral of the Assumption in downtown Louisville is the seat of the Archdiocese of Louisville. Our Lady of Gethsemani Abbey, the monastic home of Catholic writer Thomas Merton, is in nearby Bardstown, Kentucky, and also in the archdiocese. Most of Louisville's Roman Catholic population is of German descent, the result of large-scale 19th-century immigration.
Bellarmine University and Spalding University in Louisville are affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church.
Protestant denominations
One in three Louisvillians is Southern Baptist, belonging to one of 147 local congregations. This denomination increased in number when large numbers of people moved into Louisville in the early 20th century from rural Kentucky and Tennessee to work in the city's factories; some of these migrants also formed Holiness and Pentecostal churches and Churches of Christ.
German immigrants in the 19th century brought not only a large Catholic population, but also the Lutheran and Evangelical faiths, which are represented today in Louisville by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, and the United Church of Christ, respectively.
The city is home to two megachurches. Southeast Christian Church, with its main campus in Middletown and three others in the surrounding region, is, , the seventh-largest church in the United States. St. Stephen Church is the 38th largest in the US, and has the largest African American congregation in Kentucky.
The city is home to several religious institutions: the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville Bible College, Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary and the denominational headquarters of the Presbyterian Church (USA).
Louisville is home to the oldest African-American Seventh-day Adventist congregation, Magazine Street Church.
The historic Christ Church Cathedral is the seat of the Episcopal Diocese of Kentucky, which covers the western part of the state.
Eastern Orthodox
Louisville has two Eastern Orthodox parishes: Assumption Greek Orthodox Church, and the Antiochian parish, St. Michael the Archangel (with a Chapel, St. George).
Other sects
The Louisville Kentucky Temple, the 76th temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), is located in nearby Pewee Valley (mailing address of Crestwood), and serves members of the church in Kentucky, Southern Indiana, parts of Ohio and West Virginia.
The city is also the home of three Unitarian Universalist churches: All Peoples Unitarian Universalist Congregation (formerly Thomas Jefferson Unitarian Church), First Unitarian Church, and Clifton Unitarian Church.
Judaism
The Jewish population of around 8,500 in the city is served by five synagogues. Most Jewish families emigrated from Eastern Europe at the start of the 20th century; around 800 Soviet Jews have moved to Louisville since 1991. Jewish immigrants founded Jewish Hospital in what was once the center of the city's Jewish district. From 2005 to 2012, Jewish Hospital merged with two Kentucky-based Catholic healthcare systems to form KentuckyOne Health, which later in 2012 announced a partnership with the University of Louisville Hospital. A significant focal point for Louisville's Jewish community is located near Bowman Field, where there are two Orthodox synagogues (including Anshei Sfard, founded in 1893), the Jewish Community Center, Jewish Family and Career Services, and an affordable housing complex.
Islam
In 2001, there were an estimated 4,000 to 10,000 practicing Muslims in Louisville attending six local mosques. These mosques include the Westport Mosque, a part of the newly founded Muslim Community Center. The Muslim Community Center includes The Islamic School of Louisville (ISofL), an expanding school located on Old Westport Road. The ISofL is adjacent to the Westport Mosque.
Hinduism
The Hindu temple of Kentucky opened in suburban Louisville in 1999, and had about 125 members and two full-time priests in 2000. The temple was renovated and rededicated in the summer of 2011.
Buddhism
Various Buddhist sanghas and organizations exist in and around the Louisville area. These include: The Louisville Community of Mindful Living (formerly "The Sangha of Louisville"), the Drepung Gomang Center for Engaging Compassion, and the Vietnamese Buddhist Association of Louisville.
Taoism
Taoist practices in Louisville are represented by a local branch of the International Taoist Tai Chi Society.
Baháʼí Faith
The Baháʼí Faith has been present in Louisville from the 1920s, with the first Baháʼí center opening in 1965. The current Baháʼí center, dating to 1999, was designed to accommodate a larger active Baháʼí community.
Neopaganism
Louisville is home to a strong and vibrant Pagan community, including Wicca and other neopagan religions. There are over 60 Kentucky pagan groups listed at Witchvox, including over a dozen in Louisville. (Witchvox listings are voluntary, and usually represent only a small portion of the local pagan groups. Many or most covens and other pagan groups still prefer to remain private, as a way to avoid religious persecution.) Local networking for Louisville pagans is organized in various ways, not only through local covens and groves, but also through Louisville Pagan Pride, local pagan meetups via meetup.com, local occult shops such as MoonStruck, and a CUUPS chapter at a local Unitarian church. There was a Pagan Student Union active for years at the University of Louisville, but the club is currently dormant.
Interfaith activities
Since 1996, the Center for Interfaith Relations has hosted Festival of Faiths, a multi-day national interfaith gathering featuring music, poetry, film, art and dialogue with internationally renowned spiritual leaders, thinkers and practitioners. The Huffington Post ranked the Festival of Faiths sixth in its list of America's top spiritual travel destinations.

Frederick Gotfurt (born Fritz Männe Gottfurcht, 8 August 1901 – 22 February 1973) was a German-British writer, scenario editor, producer and executive. In the 1940s and 1950s they were scenario editor at Associated British Picture Corporation and was heavily relied upon by head of production Robert Clarke. They have been called a key creative influence at that company - in particular their interest in the character of "the outsider" seen displayed in Last Holiday (1950) and Portrait of Clare (1950).

Burundi competed at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7 September to 18 September 2016.
Disability classifications
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.

This is a list of hiking trails in Minnesota. To be included in this list, the trail must be in the U.S. state of Minnesota, and it must be designated for hiking by a primary source or be notable for hiking in credible secondary sources. It is not sufficient for the trail to merely accommodate pedestrian uses like walking or running to be on this list. While this list may include some multi-use trails and paved paths, hiking must be a predominant type of activity for the trail, which deliberately excludes many shared bicycle paths, sidewalks, snowmobile/ATV trails, urban walking areas, and other types of non-automobile paths. Hiking is considered a recreational activity that fits Classes 1-3 of the Yosemite Decimal System.

The Full English is the fourth solo album by Judge Smith. Because of the mainly acoustic instrumentation the album has an "unplugged" feel to it, and is one of the more accessible albums by Judge Smith. Three of the songs on The Full English had been released before, but were now re-recorded, "Carpet Tiles" and "Tell Me You Love Me" on Dome Of Discovery (1994), and "It's The Silence That Kills You" as part of the songstory Curly's Airships (2000). Musically, the album is very diverse, incorporating Eastern European Gypsy-flavoured numbers, songs in the retro-rock tradition, narrative chansons, full-on café Tango, Reggae, and even Hip-Hop beats.
Production
The Full English was recorded between October 2004 and March 2005, mainly in Smith's own recording studio in Sussex. Because Smith was invited by René van Commenée to give a lecture in Rotterdam on the subject of "Recording major projects with no money", they were able to record Van Commenée's drum and percussion playing in the Netherlands. Only when a considerable amount of recording had already been done, Marco Olivotto offered to mix and release the album, which was done at the Labour Of Love studio in Rovereto, Italy, in March 2005.
Release
The album was released 6 May 2005, the same day Van der Graaf Generator (a band co-founded by Judge Smith) did a reunion concert in the Royal Festival Hall in London. In the afternoon of that day Judge Smith did one of their scarce live-performances, in the Cobden Club in London. The same four musicians that appear on the album also performed the concert, and all songs from the album (and some more) were played.
Cover art
The art work shows a full English breakfast, and the four musicians about to eat various parts of it.

Gold Circle was a discount department store chain based in Ohio. Founded in 1967, it was a division of Federated Department Stores with 76 stores when the chain was sold and dismantled in 1988.
History
Covering mostly New York, Ohio, Kentucky and Western Pennsylvania, the chain was founded in 1967 in Columbus, Ohio, with its corporate headquarters and distribution center located in Worthington, Ohio, a northern Columbus suburb. In 1984, Gold Circle was notable as the first major discounter to implement chain-wide UPC barcode scanning in an effort to reduce checkout time for shoppers and improve inventory accuracy and speed store merchandise replenishment.
Merger with Richway
In 1986, Federated merged its Gold Circle division with its Richway Department Stores, another Federated discount division. While the chains each continued to operate under their original names (though several Richways were converted to Gold Circles), buying and other administrative functions for both were consolidated into Gold Circle's Worthington, Ohio headquarters.
Liquidation
After Campeau Corporation acquired Federated Department Stores in 1988, Gold Circle was liquidated along with Richway (in addition to the sale or liquidation of several other under-performing Federated divisions). The chain was dismantled in late 1988 with Kimco Development acquiring all of the store locations while the corporate office and distribution center were sold off in separate transactions. Hills leased 35 Gold Circle stores in Ohio, New York, and Kentucky and immediately converted them into Hills stores following the liquidation sales, reopening early in 1989. Some of the Gold Circle stores became Hills Department Stores or Target, while Springfield and Elyria, Ohio, became Kmart. One in New Kensington, Pennsylvania, had previously been converted to a Giant Eagle.

TAMA 300 is a gravitational wave detector located at the Mitaka campus of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. It is a project of the gravitational wave studies group at the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research (ICRR) of the University of Tokyo. The ICRR was established in 1976 for cosmic ray studies, and is currently developing the Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector (KAGRA).
TAMA 300 was preceded in Mitaka by a 20m prototype TAMA 20 in years 1991-1994. Later the prototype was moved underground to Kamioka mine and renamed LISM. It operated 2000-2002 and established seismic quietness of the underground location.
Construction of the TAMA project started in 1995. Data were collected from 1999 to 2004. It adopted a Fabry–Pérot Michelson interferometer (FPMI) with power recycling. It is officially known as the 300m Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Antenna due to having 300 meters long (optical) arms.
The goal of the project was to develop advanced techniques needed for a future kilometer sized interferometer and to detect gravitational waves that may occur by chance within the Local Group.
Observation of TAMA has been terminated, and work moved to the 100 m Cryogenic Laser Interferometer Observatory (CLIO) prototype in Kamioka mine.
As of 2020, modified TAMA 300 is used as a testbed to develop new technologies.

Moses ben Isaac ha-Levi Minz (15th century) was a German rabbi, a disciple of R. Yaakov Weil and contemporary of Israel Isserlein, whom they frequently consulted. They were successively rabbi at Mainz, Landau, Bamberg, and Posen.  They are one of the first known Jewish Scholars to have officiated as Rav of a city in Poland.
In their responsa (No. 114) they mention a certain Jacob Margolioth of לוקו (Lucca?), and refers to a case of divorce in Posen in 1444 (Steinschneider gives 1474). Fränkel (Zeitschrift, iii. 387) doubts that Moses ever was at Posen. They suggest that פוזנו (Posen) is a printer's mistake for פיזרו (Pesaro). Moses' responsa (Cracow, 1617) mention also Joseph Colon, Israel Isserlein, and their cousin Judah Minz. Responsum No. 46 contains a dispute over a philological point with Eliezer Treves (comp. M. Wiener in Monatsschrift, xvi. 390).

Government
Presidential elections
Prior to 1944, Clark County was a swing county, backing the national winner in every presidential election from 1900 to 1940. From 1944 on, it has become a Republican stronghold in presidential elections aside from 1964 when Lyndon B. Johnson won the county as part of a nationwide landslide victory.
Laws
The Kansas Constitution was amended in 1986 to allow the sale of alcoholic liquor by the individual drink with the approval of voters, either with or without a minimum of 30% of sales coming from food. Clark County is one of 35 counties in the state that allows for the sale of liquor by the drink without the minimum food sales stipulation.

Career
Al-Tonsi's writing addresses themes of violence, rebellion, motherhood and intimacy.
Selected publications
Since their first publication, works include:
A Rose for the Last Days (Merit House, Cairo, 2002)
A Homeland Called Desire (Merit House, Cairo, 2005)
Short History (Arab Renaissance House, Beirut, 2006)

Index of Fear (Dar Al-Ain Publishing, Cairo, 2018)
Reception
Al-Tonsi is viewed as an important voice in the middle-generation of women poets who have published since the 1980s.
The late Egyptian poet Ahmed Fouad, the star of their third work, "A Homeland Called Desire", said that Rana Al-Tonsi "carries the concerns of an orphan generation rejecting the experience of the fathers who inherited the homeland." Egyptian critic Salah Fadl, says of Rana's Tunisian Poem that it "does not rely on a continuous narrative, for a single story ... but rather composes fragments of spaced parts … It ranges from the outside to the self, from sense to abstract morality ..."

The Bras d'Apic (in English: Apic Arm) is a river which flows in the municipalities of Saint-Marcel and Saint-Cyrille-de-Lessard, in the L'Islet Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Chaudière-Appalaches, in Quebec, in Canada.
The "Bras d'Apic" is a tributary of the east bank of Bras Saint-Nicolas which flows to the south-east bank of the rivière du Sud (Montmagny); the latter flows north-east to the south shore of the St. Lawrence River.
Geography
The main watersheds neighboring Bras d'Apic are:
north side: Northeast arm, Bras de Riche, Carlos stream;
east side: Bras de Riche, Bras de la rivière Ouelle, Tenturette River, Grand Calder River;
south side: Great Noire River, Buckley River, Rocheuse River, Méchant Pouce River;
west side: Rivière du Petit Moulin, rivière des Perdrix, Bras Saint-Nicolas.
The arm of Apic has its source at Lake Apic (length: ; altitude: ), located in a mountainous area, in the canton of Arago of Saint-Marcel. This lake is located on the northwest side of the watershed with the Tenturette River, the current of which flows south to the hydrographic slope of the Great Black River (or Big Black River, in Maine (States-United)); the latter being a tributary of the Saint John River which crosses Maine and New Brunswick.
From Apic Lake, the Apic arm flows over , divided into the following segments:
north-west in Saint-Marcel, up to the municipal limit of Saint-Cyrille-de-Lessard;
northward, more or less along route 285 and passing through the hamlet Bras-d'Apic, until at the northern limit of the Beaubien township;
northward, up to the confluence of the eastern arm (coming from the southeast);
northwesterly in Saint-Cyrille-de-Lessard, along more or less route 285, to the Chemin du 8th rank;
north-west, to Chemin Lessard Ouest, which it intersects at south-west of the center of the village of Saint-Cyrille-de-Lessard;
westward, crossing the "Taupin Falls", to its confluence.
Bras d'Apic empties onto the south bank of the Bras Saint-Nicolas which flows north, then south-west to flow onto the south-east bank of the rivière du Sud (Montmagny). This confluence is located downstream of the Pierre-Noël road bridge, i.e. west of the center of the village of Saint-Cyrille-de-Lessard.
Toponymy
The toponym "Bras d'Apic" was made official on December 2, 1975, at the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

February – Pembroke's Men contract with Francis Langley to play the next year at their new Swan Theatre in London.
By March – Romeo and Juliet becomes the first of Shakespeare's plays to be published as a "bad quarto".
March 17 – After the death of William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham on March 5, their place as Lord Chamberlain of England is taken by George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon, son of a previous Lord Chamberlain. Lord Hunsdon reverses Cobham's policy of hostility toward the actors in English Renaissance theatre and returns to their father's policy of general tolerance and patronage. The playing company under their patronage, which includes William Shakespeare and Richard Burbage, becomes the Lord Chamberlain's Men.
April 23 – The feast for the Order of the Garter at the Palace of Whitehall in London is a likely occasion for the first performance of Shakespeare's comedy The Merry Wives of Windsor.
c. May 1 – The first performance of George Chapman's An Humorous Day's Mirth is the first comedy of humours played by the Admiral's Men at The Rose Theatre in London.
July – The season goes disastrously wrong for Pembroke's Men, when they stage the scandalous play The Isle of Dogs in London. This provokes the authorities to close all of the London theaters for the remainder of the summer. Ben Jonson, co-writer of the play with Thomas Nashe, is arrested on the orders of Queen Elizabeth I of England's "interrogator," Richard Topcliffe, briefly jailed in Marshalsea Prison, and charged with "Leude and mutynous behavior".
December – Miguel de Cervantes is jailed in Seville for discrepancies in their accounts as a tax collector.

The hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) technique derived by Yoshitaka Tanimura and Ryogo Kubo in 1989, is a non-perturbative approach developed to study the evolution of a density matrix of quantum dissipative systems. The method can treat system-bath interaction non-perturbatively as well as non-Markovian noise correlation times without the hindrance of the typical assumptions that conventional Redfield (master) equations suffer from such as the Born, Markovian and rotating-wave approximations. HEOM is applicable even at low temperatures where quantum effects are not negligible.
The hierarchical equation of motion for a system in a harmonic Markovian bath is
Hierarchical equations of motion
HEOMs are developed to describe the time evolution of the density matrix for an open quantum system. It is a non-perturbative, non-Markovian approach to propagating in time a quantum state. Motivated by the path integral formalism presented by Feynman and Vernon, Tanimura derive the HEOM from a combination of statistical and quantum dynamical techniques.
Using a two level spin-boson system Hamiltonian
Characterising the bath phonons by the spectral density
By writing the density matrix in path integral notation and making use of Feynman–Vernon influence functional, all the bath coordinates in the interaction terms can be grouped into this influence functional which in some specific cases can be calculated in closed form. Assuming a high temperature heat bath with the Drude spectral distribution and taking the time derivative of the path integral form density matrix the equation and writing it in hierarchal form yields
where destroys system excitation and hence can be referred to as the relaxation operator.
The second term in is the temperature correction term with the inverse temperature and the "Hyper-operator" notation is introduced.
As with the Kubo's stochastic Liouville equation in hierarchal form, the counter can go up to infinity which is a problem numerically, however Tanimura and Kubo provide a method by which the infinite hierarchy can be truncated to a finite set of differential equations where is determined by some constraint sensitive to the characteristics of the system i.e. frequency, amplitude of fluctuations, bath coupling etc. The "Terminator" defines the depth of the hierarchy. A simple relation to eliminate the term is found. . With this terminator the hierarchy is closed at the depth of the hierarchy by the final term:
.
The statistical nature of the HEOM approach allows information about the bath noise and system response to be encoded into the equation of motion doctoring the infinite energy problem of Kubo's SLE by introducing the relaxation operator ensuring a return to equilibrium.
Computational cost
When the open quantum system is represented by levels and baths with each bath response function represented by exponentials, a hierarchy with layers will contain:
matrices, each with complex-valued (containing both real and imaginary parts) elements. Therefore, the limiting factor in HEOM calculations is the amount of RAM required, since if one copy of each matrix is stored, the total RAM required would be:
bytes (assuming double-precision).
Implementations
The HEOM method is implemented in a number of freely available codes. A number of these are at the website of Yoshitaka Tanimura including a version for GPUs which used improvements introduced by David Wilkins and Nike Dattani. The nanoHUB version provides a very flexible implementation. An open source parallel CPU implementation is available from the Schulten group.

Tequexquinahuac belongs to the municipality of Texcoco de Mora in the State of Mexico, Mexico. Tequexquinahuac is a neighborhood of approximately 2,000 inhabitants that is situated in the metropolitan zone of Mexico City, to the Oriente of the de la Ciudad de México (borough)of lago de Texcoco. Tequexquinahuac has changed from a common town to being an important region between lago de Texcoco (one of the most important industrialized municipalities in the state of Mexico) and Mexico City. As such, it is a clear example of the urbanization that has been taking place in Mexico in the last 80 years. Currently it is a common urban zone of the third world.

Alejandra Campoverdi (born September 20, 1979) is an American women's health advocate and former White House aide. Under President Barack Obama, Campoverdi was the first White House Deputy Director of Hispanic Media.
Early life and education
Born in Los Angeles, Campoverdi was raised by a single mother and their grandmother who immigrated to the United States from Mexico. Campoverdi's mother initially worked in a factory that manufactured car floor mats before later becoming a kindergarten teacher at a school in inner-city Los Angeles. Campoverdi spent their childhood sharing a cramped apartment with their mother, grandmother, and several aunts and uncles. There were periods when their family was on welfare, WIC and Medi-Cal, California's public health insurance program. Campoverdi attended Saint Monica Catholic High School on financial assistance and with the support of non-profits and pipeline programs.
They graduated cum laude from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California. Campoverdi worked as a part-time actor and model during their time at USC to pay for their education. They later received their Master of Public Policy from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Campoverdi pointed to the vote for 1994 California Proposition 187 and the 1992 Los Angeles riots as events that shaped their worldview and served as a political awakening.
Career
After working for the Agricultural Worker Health Initiative at The California Endowment, a health-focused foundation that expands access to quality and affordable healthcare to underserved communities in California, and following their master's degree, Campoverdi was hired by then-Senator Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, to work in the Chicago headquarters. They lived off their credit cards, had no health insurance and stayed in supporter housing. Campoverdi's focus during the campaign was outreach to various constituent groups, including the Latino community.
Following Obama's victory, Campoverdi was appointed to work in the West Wing of the White House as Special Assistant to the White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, Mona Sutphen. They later became the first ever White House Deputy Director of Hispanic Media. In the latter role, Campoverdi developed and implemented the White House's communications strategy directed towards the Hispanic community and briefed President Obama in preparation for interviews with Hispanic media. Campoverdi also worked on White House communications around a broad range of issues, including the Affordable Care Act and its effects on the Latino community.
In 2012, Campoverdi left the White House and joined Univision as Senior Advisor for Innovation and Communications Strategy. Campoverdi subsequently served as Managing Editor of #EmergingUS at the Los Angeles Times, a multimedia venture founded by Jose Antonio Vargas that explores race, immigration and the emerging American identity.
In December 2016, Campoverdi announced that they would seek the nomination of the Democratic Party in the 34th congressional district special election, to replace Xavier Becerra, who has been appointed to succeed Kamala Harris as Attorney General of California.
Campoverdi cited the election of Donald Trump and the potential repeal of the Affordable Care Act as their motivation to run. In the April 4, 2017 primary election, Campoverdi did not make the run-off, and former California Assembly member Jimmy Gomez was elected.
Boards
Campoverdi serves on the Boards of Harvard's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, the California Community Foundation, the Harvard Journal of Hispanic Policy, UCLA's Center for Diverse Leadership in Science, and is a member of the Pacific Council on International Policy.
In 2017, Campoverdi was appointed to serve as a Commissioner for the California Children and Families Commission, also known as First 5 California. The Commission is a statewide body that is dedicated to improving the lives of California's youngest citizens and their families through a multi-faceted approach that includes education, health services, childcare, and other vital programs.
 They are a volunteer teacher for InsideOUT Writers, through which they teach a weekly creative writing class to incarcerated youth in Los Angeles' Central Juvenile Hall.
Women's health advocacy
In March 2017, Campoverdi revealed in a profile by The Washington Post that they have inherited the BRCA2 gene mutation, giving them an 85% risk of developing breast cancer, and that they planned to have a preventive double mastectomy. Campoverdi lost both their great-grandmother and grandmother to breast cancer, and their mother and two aunts have also battled the disease.
Campoverdi made the protection of access to affordable healthcare and the Affordable Care Act a focus of their congressional campaign, choosing to speak publicly about their personal health in an effort to bring attention to the stakes of limited access to healthcare. Two days after they went public with their diagnosis, they released a television ad saying, "If Donald Trump wants to have a conversation about women's bodies, let's start with mine."
In 2017, Campoverdi was awarded Penn Medicine's Basser Center for BRCA's inaugural YLC Distinguished Advocacy Award for their advocacy around BRCA-related cancers.
In October 2018, Campoverdi underwent a preventive double mastectomy to lower their risk of developing breast cancer. Routine testing of the removed tissue subsequently revealed they had unknowingly had Stage 0, non-invasive breast cancer, which every previous mammogram, ultrasound, and MRI had not detected. Because of their recent preventive surgery, Campoverdi did not need to do any additional treatment. Campoverdi said, "I beat breast cancer before I even knew I had it."
Campoverdi speaks often about the importance of being your own best health advocate and their decision to be "CEO of their own body."  They are the founder of The Well Woman Coalition, an initiative aiming to empower women of color to have agency over their own health and healing through awareness, education, and advocacy. Campoverdi also founded LATINX & BRCA in partnership with Penn Medicine's Basser Center for BRCA. LATINX & BRCA is the first awareness campaign on the BRCA gene mutation that targets Latinos and offers Spanish-language educational materials.
In an op-ed for Cosmopolitan, Campoverdi wrote, "Now more than ever, we must recognize and accept the complexity of real women, and celebrate them in their quest for leadership roles. Whole, multidimensional women. Please throw your name in the arena, whichever one you're in — because it only gets better every time one of us tries."
Documentary film, "Inheritance: Women, BRCA, and Hereditary Cancer," - 2019
Alejandra Campoverdi appeared in the film Inheritance they and documentarian Jonathan Silvers co-produced about an inherited variant for the BRCA gene. The gene equates to a higher than average risk for breast and / or ovarian cancer.
A medical device company, Sientra Breast Implant Company, is the corporate sponsor of the film that had an estimated $800,000 budget.
The narrative follows multiple women as they experience mastectomy. Alongside warnings about the BRCA gene and a controversial look at pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, several of the stories include elective plastic surgery. Science shows that liposuction causes an increase in disease producing visceral fat and may cause many health and aesthetic problems. Nowhere in the film are the dangers and problems of liposuction mentioned.

Due to COVID-19, the NCAA ruled in October 2020 that the 2020–21 season would not count against the eligibility of any basketball player, thus giving all players the option to return in 2021–22. Additionally, any players who have declared for the 2022 WNBA draft—including seniors, who must opt into this year's draft—have the option to return if they make a timely withdrawal from the draft and end any pre-draft relationships with agents. Thus, separate lists will initially be maintained for confirmed and potential departures.

was a Japanese master of karate who created the Wadō-ryū style of karate. They were the first Grand Master of Wadō-ryū karate, and received high awards within Japan for their contributions to karate.
Early life
Ōtsuka was born on June 1, 1892, in Shimodate City, Ibaraki, Japan. They were one of four children to Tokujiro Ōtsuka, a medical doctor. At the age of 5 years, they began training in the martial art of jujutsu under their great-uncle, Chojiro Ebashi (a samurai). Ōtsuka's father took over their martial arts education in 1897. At the age of 13, Ōtsuka became the student of Shinzaburo Nakayama in Shindō Yōshin-ryū jujutsu.
In 1911, while studying business administration at Waseda University in Tokyo, Ōtsuka trained in various jujutsu schools in the area. Before their studies were complete, their father died and they were unable to continue studying; they commenced work as a clerk at the Kawasaki Bank. Although they wished to become a full-time instructor, they did not pursue this course at this point out of respect for their mother's wishes.
Shotokan karate
On June 1, 1921
, Ōtsuka received the menkyo kaiden (certificate of mastery and license to teach) in Shindō Yōshin-ryū jujutsu from Nakayama Tatsusaburo. While a valid license, a common misconception is that along with this certificate they became the "4th grandmaster" of Shindō Yōshin-ryū. This is inaccurate – the 3rd grandmaster (Tatsuo Matsuoka) actually outlived Ōtsuka by almost 8 years.
Jujutsu was not to become their primary art, however; in 1922, Ōtsuka began training in Shotokan karate under Gichin Funakoshi, who was a new arrival in Japan. In 1927, they also established a medical practice and specialized in treating martial arts training injuries.
By 1928, Ōtsuka was an assistant instructor in Funakoshi's school. They also trained under Chōki Motobu and Kenwa Mabuni, and studied kobudo, around this time. Ōtsuka began to have philosophical disagreements with Funakoshi, and the two men parted ways in the early 1930s. This may have come, in part, from their decision to train with Motobu. Funakoshi's karate emphasized kata, a series of movements and techniques linked by the fighting principles. Funakoshi did not believe that sparring was necessary for realistic training. Motobu, however, emphasized the necessity of free application, and created a series of two-person kumite called yakusoku kumite.
Wado-ryu karate
On April 1, 1934, Ōtsuka opened their own karate school the Dai Nippon Karate Shinko Kai at 63 Banchi Suehiro-Cho, Kanda, Tokyo. They blended Shotokan karate with their knowledge of Shindō Yōshin-ryū jujutsu to form Wadō-ryū karate, although the art would only later take on this name several years later. With recognition of their style as an independent karate style, Ōtsuka became a full-time instructor. In 1940, their style was registered at the Butokukai, Kyoto, for the demonstration of various martial arts, together with Shotokan, Shitō-ryū, and Gōjū-ryū.
Following World War II, the practice of martial arts in Japan was banned. After a few years, however, the ban was lifted; through the 1950s, Ōtsuka held various karate competitions. In 1964, three of Ōtsuka's students Tatsuo Suzuki, Toru Arakawa, and Hajime Takashima) from Nihon University toured Europe and the United States of America, demonstrating Wadō-ryū karate.
Later life
On April 29, 1966, Emperor Hirohito awarded Ōtsuka the Order of the Rising Sun, Fifth Class for their contributions to karate. In the next few years, Ōtsuka wrote two books on karate: Karate-Do, Volume 1 (1967, focused on kata) and Karate-Do, Volume 2 (1970, focused on kumite). On October 9, 1972, the Kokusai Budoin International Martial Arts Federation (IMAF Japan) awarded Ōtsuka the title of Shodai Karate-do Meijin Judan (first-generation karate master 10th dan); this was the first time this honor had been bestowed on a karate practitioner.
Ōtsuka continued to teach and lead Wadō-ryū karate into the 1980s, and died on January 29, 1982. In 1983, their son, Jiro Ohtsuka, became the second Grand Master of Wadō-ryū karate and honored their father by taking the name "Hironori Ōtsuka II."
Notes
a. Ōtsuka's surname is sometimes also spelled as Ohtsuka.

The New Energy to Reinvent and Diversify Fund or NERD fund was developed through State of Michigan Governor Rick Snyder's office in 2011. Developed through a 501c4 organization, the purpose of the fund was to subsidize government expenses from unlimited anonymous corporate donations. The fund gathered $1.3 million in 2011 and another $368,000 in 2012. On October 21, 2013, it was announced that the NERD fund would close down.
The NERD fund was used to support politically sensitive projects for the State of Michigan. Mlive reports "The fund has been used to upgrade an auditorium in the governor's offices, buy an alarm system for their house, pay travel expenses for their staff and cover living expenses for Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr". Richard Baird, who assisted with several sensitive projects at the request of Governor Snyder, was paid through the NERD fund; Baird will instead be appointed transformational manager for the Governor's office.
Controversy
Since its inception, the NERD fund was criticized for the anonymity of its donors. This criticism is the primary reason stated for closing the fund.

Z-RNA is a left-handed alternative conformation for the RNA double helix. Just like for Z-DNA, Z-RNA is favored by a sequence composed of Purine/Pyrimidine repeats and especially CG repeats.
Discovery
The ability of dsRNA to convert into a left-handed helix was demonstrated using NMR and circular dichroism in 1984. This conversion was shown to require high ionic strength and elevated temperatures (35 degrees).
Structural characteristics
Z-RNA to resemble, but not be identical, to that of Z-DNA. The structure of the complex of a Zalpha domain with Z-RNA under close to physiological salt concentrations however suggests a structure much closer to the Z-DNA conformation and points to two forms of Z-RNA (low and high salt conformations)
Role in biology
Formation of Z-RNA in living cells was suggested by experiments using anti-Z-RNA antibodies to stain fixed protozoan cells Further evidence accrued with the discovery that the Zalpha domain of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 binds and recognizes with high affinity Z-RNA. Structural features of the recognition of Z-RNA by Zalpha domains were revealed by the crystallographic study of the complex

Margaret Foster is an American film and television actor. Some of their many roles were in the 1979 TV miniseries version of The Scarlet Letter, and the films Ticket to Heaven, The Osterman Weekend, and They Live.
Early years
Foster was born in Reading, Pennsylvania to David and Nancy (née Adamson) Foster on 10th May 1948, and grew up in Rowayton, Connecticut with four siblings: sisters Gray, Jan, and Nina, and brother Ian. They studied acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York.
Career
In 1968, Foster acted in a Cornell Summer Theater production of John Brown's Body. Later in 1968, they were in the off-Broadway production of The Empire Builders.
When Loretta Swit was unable to reprise their television-film role of Detective Christine Cagney when the film was adapted into the Cagney & Lacey TV series, Foster took on the role for the short (six episodes) first season, before they were replaced by Sharon Gless. Entertainment columnist Dick Kleiner wrote in August 1982 about Foster's being dropped from the show: "It isn't a pretty story, no matter who you talk to. Meg was so hurt and distraught that they still aren't talking. But they told friends that they felt as though they had been hit by a truck." Kleiner's story implied that Foster's dismissal from the show had cost their other opportunities. "Until that news spread," they wrote, "she was an in-demand actor."
Foster worked throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. They guest-starred in numerous TV shows including two episodes of Hawaii Five-O (1973 and 1976), The Six Million Dollar Man season two episode "Straight on 'til Morning" (1974), Three for the Road (1975), and the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine season four episode "The Muse" (1996).
Other TV shows include Bonanza, The Twilight Zone, The F.B.I., Here Come the Brides, Storefront Lawyers, Barnaby Jones, Murder, They Wrote, Miami Vice, Mannix, The Cosby Show, Quantum Leap, ER. They also portrayed Hera in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess. .
They also appeared in films throughout the 1980s, beginning with a role as a woman who worked in the games in a traveling carnival in Carny, starring Jodie Foster, Gary Busey and Robbie Robertson; the villainous Evil-Lyn in the big-screen version of Masters of the Universe; and Holly in the John Carpenter film They Live, with "Rowdy" Roddy Piper.
They were nominated for a 1982 Genie Award for Best Performance by a Foreign Actress for the film Ticket to Heaven. Since the 1990s, Foster has acted mainly in stage productions, including King Lear and Barabbas.
Foster's striking pale-blue eyes were dubbed "the eyes of 1979" by Mademoiselle magazine. In a newspaper interview that year, they said in their opinion, their eyes were not "so distinctive". However, some film and television producers had Foster wear contact lenses to lessen what they considered their eyes' "distractive" effect.
Personal life
Foster is divorced from Canadian actor Stephen McHattie. They have a son, Christopher.

Jacques Bouillart (1669 – 11 December 1726) was a Benedictine monk of the Congregation of St.-Maur.
Bouillart was born in the Diocese of Chartres. They professed at the Monastery of St. Faron de Meaux in 1687. They were the author of Histoire de l'abbaye royale de Saint-Germain-des-Prés (Paris, 1724). This history of the Benedictine monastery contains biographies of the abbots that ruled over it, since its foundation by Childeric I in 543, along with historical events related to the abbey. It also contains many illustrations and detailed descriptions of architecture, art and historical documents. Bouillart also edited a martyrology of Usuard. In this publication they attempted to establish the genuineness and authenticity of the manuscript preserved at Saint-Germain-des-Prés, against the Jesuit hagiographer Père Jean-Baptiste Du Sollier (1669–1740), who in their revised edition of Usuard's martyrology had paid no attention to this manuscript.

From mid-May to mid-June 2019, India and Pakistan had a severe heat wave. It was one of the hottest and longest heat waves since the two countries began recording weather reports. The highest temperatures occurred in Churu, Rajasthan, reaching up to , a near record high in India, missing the record of set in 2016 by a fraction of a degree. 32 days are classified as parts of the heatwave, making it the second longest ever recorded.
As a result of hot temperatures and inadequate preparation, more than 184 people died in the state of Bihar, with many more deaths reported in other parts of the country. In Pakistan, five infants died after extreme heat exposure.
The heat wave coincided with extreme droughts and water shortages across India and Pakistan. In mid-June, reservoirs that previously supplied Chennai ran dry, depriving millions. The water crisis was exacerbated by high temperatures and lack of preparation, causing protests and fights that sometimes led to killing and stabbing.
Background
Heat waves worldwide have become more extreme and more frequent due to human-influenced climate change and global warming. Since 2004, India and Pakistan have experienced 11 of its 15 warmest recorded years. The frequency and duration of heat waves in India and Pakistan has increased. The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology has identified several contributing factors, including "El Niño Modoki", an irregular El Niño in which the central Pacific Ocean is warmer than the eastern part, and the loss of tree cover, which reduces shade, increasing temperatures, and reduces moisture in soil, which results in less evapotranspiration and more heat transfer into the atmosphere.
In response to the growing number of deaths from heat waves, the Indian government, although not addressing the root causes, began implementing measures intended to save lives in 2013. In Ahmedabad, for example, "school days were reduced, government work programs ceased, and free water was distributed in busy areas." Public gardens were opened during the daytime so that people could seek shade. Professor of public health Parthasarathi Ganguly estimated that 800 fewer people died in 2014 as a result of these policies.
In India, the rainy monsoon season typically begins on 1 June. However, in 2019, the season was delayed by seven days and began on 8 June. When it did occur, the monsoon made slow progress and only brought rains to 10–15% of the country by 19 June. Normally, two-thirds of the country would have received monsoon rains by this time. The lack of rainfall has intensified heat wave conditions and increased water scarcity.
Impact
The heat wave has caused multiple deaths and cases of illness. As of 31 May 2019, 8 deaths and 456 cases of illness due to heat were reported in Maharashtra, at least 17 deaths in Telangana, and 3 deaths and 433 cases of heat stroke in Andhra Pradesh. On 10 June 2019, three passengers were found dead on a train as it arrived in Jhansi, apparently due to the extreme heat. A fourth passenger was found in critical condition and brought to a hospital where they died of overheating. In the state of Bihar, heat-related deaths reached 184 on 18 June according to Al Jazeera, while according to Zee News the death toll was 139 on 19 June 2019.
High temperatures have broken or nearly broken records in various cities across India and Pakistan. At one point, 11 of the 15 warmest places in the world were all located in the country. On 2 June 2019, the city of Churu recorded a temperature of , only one-fifth of a degree Celsius short of the country's highest-ever temperature, during the 2016 heat wave. On 9 June 2019, Allahabad reached , breaking its previous all-time record. On 3 and 4 June 2019, the temperature in Jacobabad reached making Pakistan's highest-ever temperature. On 10 June 2019, the temperature in Delhi reached , a new record high for the city in the month of June. On the same day, peak power usage in Delhi reached 6,686 MW, breaking all previous records. On 29 June 2019, the temperature in Islamabad and Rawalpindi reached .
The total number of deaths is unknown. For comparison, the 2003 European heat wave killed an estimated 35,000–70,000 people, with temperatures slightly less than in India and Pakistan. In human temperature physiology, core temperatures of are said to be a fever of type hyperpyrexia, and considered a medical emergency as temperature may lead to problems including permanent brain damage, or death.
Water shortages
Droughts and water shortages have occurred in multiple states across India and Pakistan, worsening heat wave conditions. In Chennai, millions of people are without consistent access to water. A lack of rainwater and groundwater has left four of the reservoirs that supply the city completely dry. The inability to meet demand for water has forced businesses like hotels and restaurants to close. Water tankers from areas of Tamil Nadu unaffected by drought have been bringing water into some areas of the city. However, government tankers can take up to a month to appear after requested, so some wealthy residents and business owners have opted to pay for costly private water tankers. The poor who live in slums do not have this option; a family in Chennai's slums may receive as little as of water every day compared to an average American household which uses of water a day. In Coimbatore, at least 550 people were arrested for protesting the city's government for mismanaging the water crisis.
Conflicts over access to water have also occurred throughout India. On 7 June, six people were stabbed in Jharkhand during a fight near a water tanker, and one man was killed in a similar fight in Tamil Nadu. In Madhya Pradesh on 5 June, a fight over water led to two men being "seriously injured", while in a separate fight a day earlier, a water tanker driver was "beaten up". In early June, fifteen monkeys were found dead in a forest in Madhya Pradesh, possibly as a result of the heat wave. Veterinarian Arun Mishra says this may have happened due to a conflict over water with a larger group of 30–35 monkeys. Mishra said this was "rare and strange" because herbivores do not usually engage in such conflicts.
Bihar encephalitis outbreak
The heat wave is a possible aggravating factor in an encephalitis outbreak in Bihar which has killed over 100 children since 1 June.
Responses
The Indian National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) had a goal for keeping heat related deaths this year to single digits. In 2018, the heat wave death toll was kept at 20 through public safety measures; for example, government workers across the country conducted awareness campaigns and distributed free water. However in 2019, the national general election took place and workers who normally issued heat wave warnings were instead performing election duties.
In early June, the Indian Meteorological Department issued a severe heat wave warning in Rajasthan and nearby areas such as Delhi. The Ministry of Health advised avoiding the sun between noon and 3 p.m. and not drinking alcohol, tea, or coffee. Meanwhile the NDMA recommended covering the head, cross-ventilating rooms, and sleeping under a slightly wet sheet.
Asphalt used for roads expectantly begins to melt at ; therefore, on 3 June, the government of Churu poured water onto roads in order to cool them and prevent them from melting.
In response to fights over water in Madhya Pradesh, the police were deployed to guard water tankers and other sources of water from rioters, beginning 8 June.
On 17 June, the government of Gaya, a city in Bihar, imposed Section 144 to be active, which empowers an executive magistrate to prohibit an assembly of more than four persons in an area, and banned construction work and assemblies between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
The Pakistan Medical Association urged people to learn about the measures to avoid heat-related deaths.

Baadal () is a 1985 Indian Hindi-language drama film directed by Anand Sagar, edited by Subhash Sehgal, and stars Shammi Kapoor, Mithun Chakraborty, Poonam Dhillon, Arun Govil, Bob Christo and Shakti Kapoor.
Plot
Thakur Kiran Singh (Arun Govil) is the nephew of Thakur Shamsher Singh (Shammi Kapoor). Thakur Kiran Singh's father was killed by Baadal's (Mithun Chakraborty) father who is also dead, over a piece of land on which Baadal's family lives and refuses to sell. Thakur Kiran Singh and Baadal constantly threaten and provoke each other. Thakur Kiran Singh's cousin Meenakshi, (Poonam Dhillon) daughter of Thakur Shamsher Singh meets Baadal in a bus hijacking on their way home from college. Baadal saves them from dacoits and Meenakshi becomes friends with him. When Thakur Kiran Singh goes to collect them they become curious about Kiran's cold behaviour towards Baadal. When Meenakshi mentions this to Thakur Shamsher Singh they tell them Kiran is right, which leaves more questions. Kamini Singh (Madhu Kapoor), who is Kiran's wife and Meenakshi's sister-in-law tells them that Baadal's father is responsible for the death of Kiran's father. Meenakshi believes this enmity should end with the death of both fathers and continues to meet Baadal secretly and falls in love. When Kiran finds out they are enraged and gets into a fight with Baadal and is almost killed by Baadal swinging an axe at him. Meenakshi jumps in front of them and begs Baadal to spare their life for their sake. Baadal threatens that they only spared Kiran because of Meenakshi and next time they will kill him. Kamini's brother Vikram Singh (Shakti Kapoor) comes to visit and has witnessed Baadal and Meenakshi together and tells Kamini everything and suggests they marry Meenakshi to stop this. Kamini asks Kiran who agrees and speaks to Thakur Shamsher Singh about the marriage. Soon they start planning the wedding but Baadal turns up and professes their love for Meenakshi. Enraged Meenakshi's family have them beaten up. Meenakshi goes to their home to help dress their wounds and apologizes for their family. Kiran accuses Shamsher Singh of loving their daughter so much that they have put their happiness above their aim to revenge their brother's death. Shamsher Singh realizes they must not allow Meenakshi to see Baadal. Meenakshi goes to the mandir and tells Baadal they cannot be together as their families will never allow it. Baadal puts sindoor in their hair and says that they are now married. On raksha bandhan Kiran asks Meenakshi what they want as a gift. Meenakshi says they want them to protect their husband and that they must choose between their revenge for their father's death and their love for their sister. Kiran leaves the house to speak with Baadal. Kamini goes to Vikram to tie a rakhi and tells them that Kiran has gone to compromise with Baadal. Vikram says they cannot let this happen as it will ruin their plans to grab all of Thakur Shamsher Singh's wealth. Kiran realises Baadal loves Meenakshi and is not using them as they thought before. Kiran hugs Baadal and accepts them as Meenakshi's husband. Vikram who has been watching secretly fires a gunshot to kill Baadal. Kiran sees and throws themselves in the way and gets shot. Vikram runs away while Baadal tries to chase them to see who it is. When they see Kiran dying they hold them in their arms. Kiran asks Baadal to tell Meenakshi they are sorry they could not be at their wedding. Vikram goes to meet Kiran's family asking where they are as Kiran has invited them home for dinner. Baadal carries Kiran's body back to their family where all of them including Meenakshi hold them responsible for Kiran's death. The police take charge and Baadal is sentenced to life imprisonment. As they are talking to Shamsher Singh, they recognize Vikram's shoes as the killer's shoes and reveals the truth. Baadal is sent to jail as nobody believes them and they escape to confront Vikram. They arrive in time to save Vikram's maid from being killed by them and they run to tell Shamsher Singh to stop the wedding. They all arrive at Vikram's house to find it on fire with both men fighting inside. Vikram walks out towards Meenakshi and drops to the floor revealing an arrow on their back. Baadal comes out and hugs Meenakshi. Shamsher Singh apologizes to Baadal for misunderstanding them and accepts them as Meenakshi's husband.

The Floridablanca Ministry was a Spanish government that served between 1777 and 1792 during the reigns of Charles III of Spain and Charles IV of Spain. It was headed by the Count of Floridablanca, a prominent reformer, who sought to press on with the program of reforms initiated by their predecessor Grimaldi.
One of the pillars of Floridablanca's beliefs was that friendly relations with Britain were crucial for the general improvement of Spain. It was considered ironic that in 1779 Spain, at the urging of the King, entered the American War of Independence on France's side, declaring war in Britain.
Despite their reluctance, Floriblanca took much of the credit for the war, as a Spanish force took advantage of the overstretched British Navy and took several of their colonies in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. In the peace treaty that followed, Spain was awarded Minorca and Florida which had been lost to the British earlier in the century.
The war strengthened the governments position during the 1780s, and they pressed ahead with many reforms. A new threat to power began to emerge in the form of Manuel Godoy, a royal favourite and a Francophile, who grew increasingly influential. Following the outbreak of the French Revolution the reforming liberalism of Floridablanca and their followers rapidly fell out of fashion, and they were dismissed to make way for Godoy in 1792.

Searching for a Former Clarity is the third album by the Gainesville, Florida punk rock band Against Me!, produced by J. Robbins and released on September 6, 2005, by Fat Wreck Chords. Supported by singles and music videos for the songs "Don't Lose Touch" and "From Them Lips to God's Ears (The Energizer)", it was their first album to chart on the Billboard 200, reaching #114. It also reached #9 on Billboard's Top Independent Albums chart. Singer/guitarist Laura Jane Grace has described Searching for a Former Clarity as a concept album.
Composition
Searching for a Former Clarity is a punk rock album that incorporates elements of folk, dance-punk, post-punk, dub, and country.
Commercial performance
Searching For a Former Clarity reached #114 on the Billboard 200. As of 2007, the album has sold 52,000 copies.
Critical reception
Reaction to Searching for a Former Clarity was generally positive, with critics praising Grace's lyrics and the band's effective combination of different musical elements. Corey Apar of Allmusic gave the album four and a half stars out of five, calling it the band's "most introspective album to date. In both subject matter and song composition, they expand upon elements of previous releases without being afraid to veer away from expectations". Though describing the tone of the album as "more sober and resentful" in comparison to their previous efforts, they remarked that "the passion, energy, and urgency Against Me! is known for is no less present. Instead, Searching for a Former Clarity is a more developed effort that is not only one of the best punk releases of 2005, but further establishes the band's growing importance within the punk scene."
Aubin Paul of Punknews.org also praised the album, giving it four out of five stars and stating that "Unlike the simple shout-along melodies that adorned previous albums, ...Clarity demands repeated listens far more than any previous album." They praised the band's ability to effectively combine punk rock, country, and folk music, noting that "with Clarity it seems the band has finally managed to fuse these elements seamlessly in a single track." They noted that the lyrics were more personal and "painfully confessional" than on the band's previous efforts, and that the political motifs were more individualistic, focusing on "the effects of politics on real people." They summarized the album as "ambitious, fully realized and truly special. It's also a conflicted record; it's filled with internal ruminations, raw emotions and a distancing wall of sound, but it is nevertheless their most thoughtful and accomplished piece of songwriting and a record that grows more rewarding with each listen."
One criticism which Apar and Paul shared was that both found the chorus of "Unprotected Sex with Multiple Partners" to be "somewhat annoying", though Paul noted that the song had "a great opening and confessional lyrics". Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone was more critical of the album, giving it three out of five stars and describing it as "a bizarro combination of Who's Next, an angry oi-punk record and some dude's blog." They complimented Grace's lyrics as "both wordier and funnier than most rant-based punk" but also said that "over fourteen cuts, [her] Roger Daltrey bellow can grow wearisome". They did, however, praise "Holy Shit!" as "a detailed critique of a stagnating rock scene" and said that "How Low", a slower song in which Grace describes attempts to give up drugs, "prov[es] that you can't get this deep into other people's shit without getting a little on yourself."

Urich's tyrannulet (Phyllomyias urichi) is a species of bird in the family Tyrannidae. It is endemic to Venezuela. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. It is threatened by habitat loss.
It is a very rare species that had previously only been seen three times: once in 1899, a second time in the 1940s, and a third time in 2005. In May 2021, an expedition to rediscover the species was undertaken in order to verify that it had not yet gone extinct. However, the locality the species was sighted at in 2005 had been deforested by that point, and several other potential habitats had also been degraded. However, a thickly forested mountainside near Yucucual, Monagas was identified in a photo on Instagram as a potential habitat for the species. The expedition to this area was successful in spotting 2 different pairs of P. urichi, marking the first observation of the species in over a decade and the first clear photos and sound recordings ever taken of the species.
It is olive-green in color and has a shrill call. Ornithologist David Ascanio, who led the team that rediscovered the species, has described it as resembling a "little tiny Shrek" due to its coloration.

Mooca () from tupi mo-oka, meaning to build houses (formerly written as "Moóca" prior to the Reforms of Portuguese orthography) is a district in the subprefecture of the same name in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Mooca today is home to over 75,000 inhabitants, spread in its . It is also considered one of the fastest-growing districts in the city, experiencing over the last years a vigorous momentum in the construction industry. Mooca has been the stage for many social movements, specially because of the presence of a strong influence of the industry interests in the political scene of São Paulo towards the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. The composition of Mooca's economy today ranges from small businesses ran by locals, large industries, such as Lorenzetti and Groupe SEB, both important players locally and globally in the home appliances industry, and ultimately, large shopping malls offering a variety of services.
History
The plains where Mooca lies were first settled by ancient Native American communities, such as the Tupi-Guaraní. São Paulo, known in the 16th century as São Paulo de Piratininga, arose from a Jesuit mission, founded in 1554 to convert indigenous populations, and its history is often confused with that of Mooca. In 1567, Portuguese Bandeirantes, or pathfinders, based in the village of São Paulo de Piratininga moved eastwards in their expeditions and that was probably when the region was first explored. Over the centuries, Mooca became an important rural area, containing a number of farms and cottages, dependent on the work of enslaved African-Brazilians. In the 1890s the area was divided into large plots that were put on sale in order to encourage Mooca's development. The district eventually became an important industrial area as the farms gave way to factories and industries towards the beginning of the 20th century. One of the first working-class sections is Vila Maria Zélia in the northern district of Belém. Many of the industrial installations eventually moved out of the city or closed down (even though a number of them are still active) and, much of the industrial zones became residential.
Italian settlement
In early 1900s, many industries settled in Mooca's quiet plains, an isolated area back then. Because labour at that time was in high demand, many immigrants from Italy, most of them coming from the city of Naples, fled to São Paulo to take up jobs at local industries. Indeed, much of Mooca's development was an outcome of the strong Italian immigrant influence. In 1910, two out of three inhabitants of Mooca were Italian.
The largest and most important collection on the history of immigration in Brazil, and specially the large flow of Italian and immigrants arriving in São Paulo state via the port of Santos, can be found at Museu da Imigração, a state-run museum that offers a very interesting database on immigrant records.Amácio Mazzaropi museum, named after a famous Brazilian comedian born to an Italian father, is a site of interest that preserves some of Mooca's immigration golden age memories. Another site of interest that is strongly related to Mooca's Italian origins is the local soccer team stadium, Juventus Stadium (cap. 2.000).
A great number of the working-class families from Mooca found prosperity and as São Paulo was gradually changing from an industrial city into a business centre, many of those families started their own businesses (such as the Lorenzetti and Matarazzo families). Many of the more affluent families now reside in Tatuapé.
The local Italian community holds traditional religious celebrations and festivities all year round, being the most famous that of San Vito, Our Lady of Casaluce, San Gennaro (patron saint of Naples) and Our Lady Achiropita in the district of Bela Vista. These celebrations take place on the streets, where, aside from the true markets offering typical dishes, handicrafts and wine, stages for dance presentations and live traditional music are set up.
Cultural influences
A large number of Mooca's inhabitants have an Italian background although over the last century, Mooca embraced other communities from other parts of the world and regions in Brazil. Some representative communities that have contributed to Mooca's ethnic diversity are the Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Croatian, Lithuanian, Syrian, Lebanese and more recently the Bolivian and Peruvian, besides Brazilians migrants from the Northeast.
Urban development
Mooca's atmosphere has always been that of an industrial suburb. Buildings, homes and warehouses façades preserve traces of the Italian legacy and it is not unusual to find old preserved vilas operárias, narrow cobbled residential streets in large abandoned industries surroundings, where the Italians and other workers from different countries first settled.
However, this scenery has changed as in the last decades industries have been moving out of São Paulo for it has become increasingly expensive. As a result of this phenomenon, many warehouses and industries facilities were simply abandoned, creating perfect conditions for real estate speculation to turn Mooca into one of the fastest-growing districts in Brazil's largest city, consolidating its momentum as a powerhouse in East São Paulo.
Real estate speculation not only is taking place in residential areas, but also in major business areas all over the district. Office towers have been built recently, mainly along Avenida Paes de Barros. BRMalls, a Brazilian shopping centre & real state management corporation, has opened in November, 2011 a state-of-the-art shopping mall in the area, the Mooca Plaza Shopping spanning , and containing over 200 high-end stores.
Due to Mooca's industrial nature, there is a lack of green spaces in the district. The local government holds a tree plantation program through which residents may have trees planted in their sidewalks at no cost. It is quite evident, when visiting some parts of Mooca, that there is a need for green areas and locals have long called for it. Over the past years, the attempts of the government to increase the amount of green spaces in Mooca, along with the launch of residential condominiums projects that adopt a “green” concept have indeed changed much of Mooca's gray landscape.
Mooca is split into four sections (known as bairros), although these are often confused as they are very integrated and locals refer to them simply as Mooca:
• Mooca: central area
• Hipódromo: northwest, along the railway and Avenida Alcântara Machado, known as Radial Leste
• Parque da Mooca: south, along Avenida Paes de Barros
• Alto da Mooca: northeast, along Rua Siqueira Bueno extending to Rua da Mooca
Transportation
Buses
Mooca is served by several bus and trolleybus lines that connect it to the city centre, neighbouring districts (such as Tatuapé, Belém, Brás and Água Rasa) and also other cities within Greater São Paulo area (e.g. São Caetano do Sul). Some of the most important avenues, such as Avenida Paes de Barros, offer express lanes designed for buses only.
Subway
São Paulo metro system plays an important role in Mooca's transport network as it services the district and its surroundings with at least 4 (four) subway stations, named Brás, Bresser-Mooca, Belém (on Line 3-Red) and Vila Prudente (on Line 2-Green). The short surface segment of the Line 3-Red of the city's subway system was first built in the 1970s along Avenida Alcântara Machado (Radial Leste), an eight-lane highway which is one of the main gateways to eastern parts of São Paulo.
Suburban trains
A western part of Mooca which lies along the border with Brás district, is serviced by CPTM's (Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos) (English: Metropolitan Trains of São Paulo) Line 10-Turquoise from Mooca station and by Line 11-Coral from Brás station, connecting with subway Line 3-Red.
Education
The three universities, fifteen public schools (which include infant schools, primary schools, high schools and technical high schools), along with a number of private institutions offer a wide range of education options for students in Mooca. Some public schools are funded by the state of São Paulo while others are funded by the municipality of São Paulo. Additionally, the district offers three theatres, a public library (Biblioteca Affonso Taunay), and the state-ran museum Museu da Imigração.

Private schools
A great number of Mooca's private schools offers both primary and secondary school courses. There are several church-run private institutions, following Mooca's strong catholic traditions. Some of the most important independent schools, including those ran by the Catholic Church, are:
Colégio São Judas Tadeu
Colégio Santa Catarina
Colégio Ouro Preto
Colégio Santa Amélia
Colégio Passo Seguro
Colégio São Paulo (Anglo)
Instituto Pedagógico Maria Montessori
Instituto de Educação Cruz de Malta
Externato Nossa Senhora Menina
Externato São Rafael
Liceu Santa Cruz
Universities
Few districts in São Paulo contain as many higher education institutions as Mooca. Although there are no public universities, Mooca takes pride in its three private universities campuses:
Universidade São Judas Tadeu
Universidade Anhembi Morumbi
Centro Universitário Capital
Sport
If Mooca lacks green spaces in one hand, it offers sport venues and nature in the 196.000sqm of its sports club, Clube da Mooca, and at the local athletics club, Clube Atlético Juventus, which has a namesake soccer team and a small stadium (Estádio Conde Rodolfo Crespi), as mentioned above. Juventus soccer team was formed in 1924 under the name of Cotonifício Rodolfo Crespi F.C. and consisted of players who worked at Cotonifício Crespi textile industry (see photo above). One year later, a piece of land at Rua Javari next to the plant facilities was donated to the community by Crespi, owner of the textile industry, so that there would be a property for the construction of venue for the community and for the recently formed team to play. Cotonifício Rodolfo Crespi F.C switched its name in 1930, a year after it won São Paulo state league. The name Clube Atlético Juventus was suggested by Crespi. Estádio Conde Rodolfo Crespi hosted in 1959 a match between Juventus and Santos F.C., in which Pelé scored the most beautiful goal in their career. SESC Belenzinho - is a cultural centre and sports venue and, although it is located just outside the district, it is site of interest in the area as provides Mooca's population with a variety of quality theatre plays, busy cultural agenda and sports training (e.g. tennis, soccer, volleyball, basketball, yoga, pilates, etc.)
Cuisine and nightlife
Perhaps the highest index of pizza restaurants per inhabitant in São Paulo, and in the entire Latin America, is Mooca. It has at least over 100 pizza restaurants and a large number of Italian restaurants. Mooca is a top destination for people from other parts of the city who are looking for fine Italian food. Some of the most famous pizza places in Mooca include: Pizzeria São Pedro, Pizzeria do Angelo, Babbo Giovanni, Zio Pasquale, Bendita Maria, Emporio 167. Also, some of the local bars are famous in São Paulo particularly Elídio Bar, a soccer-themed bar, Moocaires, an Argentine bistro-bar, Vilarejo São Paulo, a square that concentrates a number of restaurants and bars, with a particular European-like architecture and Bar Mooca.
Moreover, Mooca has now other great restaurants and bars that worth the visit, such as Bravo Bistro, Bricabraque, Deck, and some others.

In aeronautics, the final approach (also called the final leg and final approach leg) is the last leg in an aircraft's approach to landing, when the aircraft is lined up with the runway and descending for landing. In aviation radio terminology, it is often shortened to "final".
In a standard airport landing pattern, which is usually used under visual meteorological conditions (VMC), aircraft turn from base leg to final within one-half to two miles of the airport. For instrument approaches, as well as approaches into a controlled airfield under visual flight rules (VFR), often a "straight-in" final approach is used, where all the other legs are dispensed with. Straight-in approaches are discouraged at non-towered airports in the United States.
Approach slope
An approach slope is the path that an airplane follows on its final approach to land on a runway. It takes its name from the fact that this path is ideally a gentle downward slope. A commonly used approach slope is 3° from the horizontal. However, certain airports have steeper approach paths based on topography, buildings, or other considerations. London City Airport, for example, has a 5.5° approach, and only aircraft that can maintain such an approach are permitted to use the airport.
The term glide slope is often applied to mean approach slope although to be correct, glide slope applies to the vertical guidance element of the Instrument Landing System.
Final approach point
The final approach point on an instrument approach with vertical guidance is glide slope or glide path intercept at the lowest published altitude (ICAO definition).
In the US, it is called the final approach fix (FAF) and marked on a NACO IAP by a lightning bolt symbol and on a Jeppesen terminal chart by the end of the glide slope path symbol. It is the point in space where the final approach segment begins on the instrument approach; the final approach point on a non-precision approach is marked by a maltese cross symbol. In the US, where the approach navigation aid is on the field and there is no symbol depicted, the final approach point is "where the aircraft is established inbound on the final approach course from the procedure turn and where the final approach descent may be commenced".

Vicente Almandos Almonacid (Anguinán, La Rioja, Argentina, 24 December 1882 – Buenos Aires, Argentina, 16 December 1953) was an Argentine engineer, diplomat, and aviator who participated in the First World War as pilot of the French Air Force.
They were co-founder and technical manager of the airline Aeroposta Argentina, a subsidiary of the French firm Aéropostale and the precursor of Aerolíneas Argentinas. They were the first person to cross the Andes by air at night, and was the architect of most of the air routes of Aeroposta. As a diplomat, they presided over the Argentine consulate of Boulogne-sur-Mer from 1938 to 1945.
In recognition of their achievements, in France they were awarded several honors, including the Legion of Honor and the Military Medal.
The La Rioja Airport is named in their honor.
Biography
First years
They were born in the town of San Miguel de Anguinán, located in La Rioja Province near the city of Chilecito, on 24 December 1882. Their father, Vicente Almandos Almonacid (es), was a cattle and mining entrepreneur in Famatina who held the position of Governor of La Rioja between 1877 and 1880. Their mother, Esmeralda Castro Barros, came, like their husband, from a family of unitary tradition. Their paternal grandfather was Colonel Lino Almandos (es), who fought against Chacho Peñaloza (es) and Felipe Varela (es) during the Argentine Civil Wars.
The family business prospered until the financial crisis of 1890 severely damaged mining activity and led the family business to bankruptcy. Their father died the following year. These two episodes motivated their mother to move with their six-year-old son to Buenos Aires, in search of better conditions. In the Argentine capital, Vicente studied at the National College. They entered the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires, in the engineering field.
Training as a pilot and World War I
After completing their university studies, and inspired by their faith in scientific progress and in the context of the Argentine Centennial and the Belle Époque, they designed and undertook the construction of a small airplane that they called "aeromobile." Faced with the impossibility of developing their project in Argentina and with the aim of becoming a pilot and increasing their training in engineering, they moved to Paris at the end of 1912, where the first aviation school in the world had been founded a few years earlier. In the French capital, they had the opportunity to exchange views with Gustave Eiffel, the man responsible for the construction of the Eiffel Tower and the internal structure of the Statue of Liberty.
Almonacid knew how to fly only simple airplanes. That is why after a short stay in Paris, they decided to go to the Farman Aerodrome, located near Versailles, to be credentialed as a professional pilot. It was difficult for them to understand their teachers initially because they did not speak French, but they gradually improved. In 1914, the Aeroclub de France awarded them a diploma under the authority of the French government.

David Alexander John Steel is an Australian singer-songwriter, guitarist and producer.  They are a former member of folk rock group, Weddings Parties Anything (1985–88) and pop band, The Whipper Snappers (1990–91). Steel has released eleven solo studio albums, including one as leader of Dave Steel and the Roadside Prophets and two albums with folk singer, Tiffany Eckhardt. They have been nominated for three ARIA Music Awards.
Career
1976-1984: Early bands
Early in their musical career Steel was a member of various Melbourne pub bands: Related Mechanics in 1976 with Iain Colquhoun, Peter Lillee, John Lloyd and Nick Reischbeth; Moonshine from 1976 to 1977, the Trouts in 1977 with Mark Bell, Stuart Crosby, Dave McNaughton and Rob Stevens; the Satellites from 1978 to 1981; Zeros in 1981; Strange Tennants in 1981 with Alex Formosa, Lawrence Maddy, Bruce Worrall; and Fire Below from 1984 to 1985.
Fire Below had a line-up of Steel with Lloyd Campbell on guitar, Nigel Harrison on drums and vocals, Michael Kennedy on bass guitar, and Peter Myers on guitar. They issued a single, "Walk Tall", in 1985 and provided a track, "Johnny's Tombstone", for a various artists compilation album, A Slab of Vic, in that year. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane they, "played a tough brand of pub rock."
1985-1988: Weddings Parties Anything
In 1985, Steel, on guitar, vocals and harmonica, joined a newly formed folk rock band, Weddings Parties Anything, alongside Dave Adams on drums; Mick Thomas on lead vocals, bass guitar, guitar and mandolin; Mark Wallace on piano accordion, keyboards and vocals. Steel is recorded on their first two studio albums, Scorn of the Women (April 1987) and Roaring Days (April 1988).
Prior to their second album, Karen Middleton of The Canberra Times, described how the group, "[were] compared to Irish post-punk folk rockers the Pogues, the more mellow Bushwackers and even Redgum. Steel ignored such comparisons. 'It's a rock 'n roll band', they said." Steel wrote the Weddings Party Anything tracks, "Big River", "Shotgun Wedding" and "Up for Air". Steel left in mid-1988 because of strained relations; however, according to AllMusic's Aaron Badgley, it was, "due to exhaustion." They were replaced in the group by Richard Burgman on guitar and saxophone.
1988-1992: Solo career
Steel relocated to Sydney, where they recorded their first solo single, "The Hardest Part" which was released in October 1988. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1989 it was nominated for Best Indigenous Release but lost to Weddings Party Anything's Roaring Days.
Steel's debut album, Bitter Street was produced by Graham Bidstrup and released in September 1989. McFarlane observed, "Steel's concise and economical arrangements, narrative style vocal manner drew comparisons with Paul Kelly, albeit in a very positive light." Badgley felt, "most of the songs are well-crafted country/folk/rock, but there is little variety. Steel cannot sustain an entire album on their own... [they] are, for the most part, pretty depressing. Pleasant melodies, but the songs start to sound all the same by the end of the disc."
During 1990 to 1991 they fronted the Dave Steel Band with Bidstrup on drums, Chris Bailey on bass guitar, Wayne Goodwin on fiddle, guitar and keyboards, Peter Howell on bass guitar, Graham Rankin and Dave Sandford on saxophone. They were also a guitarist of pop group, The Whipper Snappers. That line-up provided a cover version of Russell Morris' "Sweet, Sweet Love" (February 1991), which appeared on the various artists' compilation, Used and Recovered By... RRR, in 1993.
In 1991, Steel released their second solo album, Angels Never Cry, with Bidstrup producing again. Their bandmates, Bailey and Goodwin, were joined in the studio by Michael Barclay on drums, James Black on keyboards, John Brewster on guitar, Peter Bull on keyboards, Mark Dennison on saxophone, Kevin Dubber on trumpet and Charlie McMahon on didgeridoo.
The Last Radio, Steel's third album, was released in August 1992. Charles Miranda of The Canberra Times noticed, "he shows why they are a respected writer. As with their past offerings, the recording is a blend of acoustic guitar and rhythm and blues." McFarlane observed, "another well-crafted set of songs competently played... It did little, however to further [his] status as one of this country's most promising singer/guitarists."
Also in 1992 Steel formed The Maddisons with Clyde Bramley (ex-the Hitmen, Hoodoo Gurus, Damien Lovelock's Wigworld) on bass guitar, Brent Marks on drums and Wayne Tritton on guitar and lead vocals (both ex-Pressmen). That group released their debut EP, Just Fine, in September with Steel also producing, before they disbanded.
1993-2000s: Solo career and band work
In 1993 Steel formed the Dave Steel and the Roadside Prophets with Tritton, Darren Gower on drums and Gerry Kortesgast on bass guitar. They released an album, Cross My Palm in June 1993 and an extended play, Broken English in March 1994. Cross My Palm was nominated for Best Independent Release at the ARIA Music Awards of 1994.
From November 1994 to August 1995 Steel recorded their next album, Old Salt Blues which was released in June 1996. For the album they co-wrote two tracks with Andrew Pendlebury. Steel also toured as a member of the Deadly Band (1995–97) with Archie Cuthbertson, Kerry Gilmartin, Ruby Hunter, Amos Roach and Archie Roach. They worked as a session musician for various artists.
Steel's sixth album, The Edge of the World was released in May 1999 and according to McFarlane "featured a collection of contemporary Australian acoustic roots tunes with plenty of charm". One of their guest musicians was folk singer, Tiffany Eckhardt.
Steel's seventh solo album, Home Is a Hard Thing to Find was released in August 2002 and was nominated for Best Blues & Roots Album at the ARIA Music Awards of 2002.
2010-present: with Tiffany Eckhardt
Tiffany Eckhardt and Dave Steel have performed as a duo and released two albums, Sunday (2010) and Big Big Sky (2014). As from January 2015 they are married and live in Franklin, Tasmania with their two children.
Steel was inducted into the EG Fall of Fame in 2012 for their contribution to Australian music as a member of Weddings Parties Anything.

Jump River is an census-designated place in the towns of Jump River and McKinley in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. It is located on the north bank of the Jump River, from which the hamlet takes its name. As of the 2010 census, its population was 52.
History
The first settlers in the Jump River area were Barney and Gertrude Broeder, who arrived in 1892 from Thorp, thirty miles to the south. They built a log home a mile upstream from the current village, at what is now called "the swimming hole." Starting in 1897 Barney ran a post office from their house under the name Broederville. Other settlers joined the Broeders in the area through the 1890s. A sawmill was added, a school was built nearby and in 1900 the "Black Bridge" was completed, crossing the river at Broederville. The remains of its concrete abutment can still be seen on the east bank above the swimming hole.
Until 1904, the settlers of Broederville reached the outside world by foot or horse through forest and swamp. The nearest contact with the outside was the railroad at Ingram, thirteen miles to the north. But in 1904 the Stanley, Merrill and Phillips Railway pushed up through the forest from Stanley to the south, crossing the Jump River where the town hall now stands. Within a few years, the businesses all moved a mile downstream from Broederville to the railroad.
In 1907, the village of "Jump River" was platted at its current location, where the railroad crossed the river. The streets lay as they do now. The railroad had put up some buildings, including a depot. C.J. Boeckler built a hotel called the "Jump River House" and they moved their sawmill and post office from Broederville to the new town site. The Ladies' Aid Society built a hall which has been used over the years by the Catholics, the Presbyterians, the Lutherans, the Baptists, the VFW, Boy Scouts, 4-H, and for town meetings, elections, and many other purposes. More hotels and stores and sawmills were built, saloons and garages, a blacksmith shop, a feed store, a cheese factory, and shanties and houses. At times the town had a veterinarian, a dentist, a doctor, and a jeweler.
Much of this growth was driven by logging. The S.M.&P. Railway was primarily a logging railroad, hauling logs out to sawmills at Stanley and Owen. When the timber was exhausted, little freight remained. Rail passengers also declined as roads improved. The S.M.&P. shut down in 1933. Gradually the hotels, saloons, and services thinned, but farming had taken hold in the cutover land and Jump River shifted to serving the surrounding farmers.
Formal education was done for years in a two-room schoolhouse in Jump River and one-room elementary schools scattered about the countryside: Pioneer School two miles west of Jump River, Baughman School five miles west, Sunnyside three miles southwest, Wood Prairie three miles south on highway 73, and Woodland School four miles east on County D. In 1956 the three-classroom Jump River Elementary School was built east of town, and the little country schools closed. The new school operated for about forty years, then closed in another consolidation. Since then local students have been bussed to Gilman.
In 1938, local leaders formed the Jump River Electric Cooperative, with financial support from the Rural Electrification Administration. The co-op initially provided electricity to 179 members with average consumption at 29 kilowatt hours per month. By 1944 the service area had grown and the office was moved from Jump River to Ladysmith. Though Ladysmith was more convenient, some in Jump River opposed the move, and it was begun under cover of night. Today this co-op begun by Jump River locals provides electricity, cable TV, and Internet services from Gilman to Hayward.
In 2011, Jump River is smaller, but alive. The grocery store has closed, but there is still a meat locker. Three bars remain - one also a restaurant. People worship at St. Michael's Catholic church and Christ's Community Church. The fire department protects the community and homes in the surrounding countryside. In that countryside are family farms - dairy, beef, and a few Christmas tree farms. Some people work in logging and trucking and some commute to jobs in farther places like Medford and Ladysmith. Olynick Concrete is the largest local industry. The Jump River Town Hall hosts weddings and reunions. The Fourth of July is the big event of the year, with a parade, a tractor pull, a horseshoe tournament, and evening fireworks.

Aso (Filipino for dog) is an adventure story arc of the Philippine comic strip series Pugad Baboy, created by Pol Medina Jr. and originally published in the Philippine Daily Inquirer. This particular story arc lasts 88 strips long. In 2003, the story arc was reprinted in Kinse!, the fifteenth book compilation of the comic strip series. Aso is one of the three longest Pugad Baboy story arcs, the other being Maidnappers and Green Heroine.
Synopsis
The story arc begins during a briefing at OCB Headquarters with agents Echo (Eliseo) and Delta (Polgas) and their superior in attendance. The topic of discussion is the prevalence of marijuana plantations in Benguet province. Polgas, however, is assigned a mission to Mount Arayat in Pampanga, where a suspected dope farm is located.
Polgas' initial investigation
Polgas hops unto their Thunderpuppy, a Harley-Davidson V-Rod motorcycle, and heads for Mount Arayat. At the town of Bitas, they query a local regarding climbing the mountain. The local replies that they shouldn't worry about the NPA or Maria Sinukuan, the diwata said to reside on the mountain, but that there was a werewolf lurking there. As Polgas continues promenading around the town, a huramentado (a person who has run amok) attempts to hack them with a bolo knife. Polgas throws the man using an Aikido move. Upon investigating the contents of their disarmed opponent's pockets, Polgas finds what appear to be dried wood of a bluish tint. They sniff the suspicious cache and their sensitive nose is overwhelmed by what they smell; the unknown substance is actually dried psychedelic mushrooms. Polgas faints from an intense cluster headache. Upon waking up, they discover that they are in Dr. Dado Galang's clinic. The doctor tells them that aside from the increasing number of cases of people running amok, the number of rabies cases is up as well. All these could be attributed to the reports of a werewolf or impaktong aso roaming the mountain fastness.
Polgas hikes up the mountain
Upon recovering from their headache, Polgas decides to explore Mount Arayat. They first call the Thunderdog and instructs the computerized Porsche 959 to synthesize an antidote for counteracting the effects of the magic mushrooms. As they went on their way, they became aware of three persons who were following him. Deploying Gary, their fleabot, Polgas intentionally falls into their trap in order to maintain their cover as an innocent hiker. It turns out that the three guys who set the trap were out to catch the werewolf for the bounty. Polgas escapes and climbs a tree to evade the werewolf bounty hunters. Polgas decides that in order to locate the mushroom farm, they had to go towards the south-south east side of the mountain where there was little sunlight and a plentiful source of compost and fertilizer.
The mushroom farm
As Polgas headed toward that part of the mountain, Gary began to note that the punji stick traps along the way were becoming deadlier. All of a sudden, Polgas smelled something familiar; they shine their flashlight on the source of the scent and the malevolent eyes of the werewolf shone back at him. Armed with their ballistic arnis, Polgas runs toward the werewolf, which scampers away. As Polgas took up the chase, a trapdoor suddenly opens up in their path. They collide with the woman who emerged from the tunnel and both tumble down into the cave beneath. Both landed on a stetson-wearing villain. A third goon came down the trapdoor, closing it behind him. All three covered Polgas with their weapons and Carlita, the woman Polgas collided with takes their arnis.
Hoping to keep their cover, Polgas declares that they had arrived to purchase magic mushrooms. The stetson-wearing goon takes their pack, telling the others to shoot Polgas if the pack didn't contain bundles of bills. Polgas waits for the opportunity to activate the tiny switches on their left glove. The switches activate both the ballistic arnis held by Carlita, which hits the third goon in the head, and the backpack, which sends a spurt of flame towards the other goon's face. The distraction affords Polgas the opportunity to run deeper into the cave, where they discover the mushroom farm itself. As Polgas barrels through the workers trying to bar their way, the Psilocybin mushrooms' spores scatter and they soon begins to feel the effects of the psycho-active substance. As Polgas begins to hallucinate, they try to locate an exit in vain. In desperation they ask one of the workers where the exit is. Surprisingly, the worker directs them to the nearest exit. Polgas soon exited the cave, but they aren't out of danger just yet - at the mouth of the cave were scores of rabid dogs and a suspicious character injecting the dogs with an unknown substance. Upon seeing Polgas, they pressed a button on a portable stereo. Immediately, the rabid dogs went mad and attacked Polgas, who climbed a tree to evade the rabid canines. They recognized the suspicious-looking man, who had climbed the same tree they had - it was the huramentado from the town of Bitas. The goon threw a fistfull of magic mushroom spores at Polgas. Dizzy, Polgas fell from the tree. Before losing consciousness, they felt a bite on their leg. Forcing their eyes open, they saw that it was the werewolf that had bitten him.
The werewolf's true identity
The next morning, Polgas wakes up and discovers that they were at the place where they began to climb the mountain. They think that the previous day's events are just a dream, but the painful bite mark on their leg tells them otherwise. The next day, Polgas confronts Dr. Galang at their clinic. They tell them that a canine odor seems to follow the good doctor around, and that they had discovered research material regarding psilocybin mushrooms in the clinic. Dr. Galang's patient profiles also match the behavior of persons who have run amok. Polgas also observed that Dr. Galang does not seem to sweat - just like a canine. To prove their point, Polgas shoots Dr. Galang with their garapata gun. The doctor isn't affected by the garapata sweat, since true canines are immune to its effects. Polgas is quite sure that Dr. Galang is the werewolf. As they are about to arrest the doctor, after giving them a Miranda warning, the doctor jumps out an open window and escapes.
Polgas gives chase. Mounting the Thunderpuppy, they head for the dark side of Mount Arayat. From high above the forest canopy, the doctor-turned-werewolf seemingly ambushes Polgas, unseating them from the motorcycle. Polgas is still able to land on their feet, but is unable to locate Dado. As their back is turned, they are shot from behind with a double-barreled sawed-off shotgun. Their bulletproof suit saves him, but they lose consciousness and upon coming to, they discover that they had been tied upsidedown by the ankles and heels. They overhear some of the goons talking about capturing another aside from him, and they see Dado tied up in the same manner as they are a short distance away. Polgas signals Gary, the flea-bot, which had been waiting in the same place it was deployed since the day before, and it begins to hop towards Polgas.
Dado's story
While both captives waited, they began to talk in low tones. With sharp canine hearing both had no trouble engaging in a conversation, even if they were separated by quite some distance. Dado revealed that their mother had a maternal craving for dog meat while pregnant with them - thus was the reason for their present condition. They sought various cures; to counteract their natural tendency to not sweat, they experimented with psilocybin mushrooms. They experienced undesirable side effects and abandoned the idea. Their uncle Henry (the stetson-wearing goon), however, discovered the mushrooms' psychedelic effects and decided that it would be a good substitute for marijuana and they set up a test market in that same area. Dado had ever since been trying to scare buyers away as the himpaktung asu. In order to counter this threat, Henry brought in stray dogs and injected them with the rabies virus. They also set up punji traps around the perimeter of the cave. Polgas then sees their motorcycle impaled upon the punji sticks of a trap; Dado had in fact saved their lives when they pounced upon Polgas on their bike earlier.
The tide turns
Henry decides to execute both "werewolves" using silver bullets fired from an air rifle. They attempt to shoot Polgas from point-blank range but Polgas prompts Gary to cut the bonds on their wrists; Polgas grabs the rifle and wallops Henry with it. They then retrieves their ballistic arnis and dispatches a goon aiming a sawed-off shotgun at him. Polgas cuts the rope from which they were hanging and frees Dado. Dado returns the favor by dispatching Carlita/Helga, who was aiming to shoot Polgas with a sawed-off shotgun. Meanwhile, the former huramentado again throws a fistfull of magic mushroom spores at Polgas, thinking to disable them again. However, the effect on Polgas was the reverse; they became noticeably more hirsute and aggressive. Dado explains that when they bit Polgas the previous day, they had effectively transfused their acquired immunity to the effects of psychedelic mushrooms to Polgas. Dado went underground after Helga, while Polgas took on the two remaining goons.
Helga, however, managed to escape by riding a motorcycle with Dado clinging to their back. Meanwhile, Polgas orders the erstwhile huramentado to take down the Thunderpuppy and tie up the subdued goons upsidedown; Polgas leaves them at the tender mercies of the rabid dogs. Hearing Helga's motorcycle, Polgas gives chase on the Thunderpuppy after retrieving Gary, but notes that the gas tank had been pierced by the punji sticks. Gary soon sees that Helga is aiming for a cliff and warns Polgas. Polgas uses their wrist spitter to shoot a line into the trees' branches above and snags Dado off Helga's back. Helga's motorcycle went over the cliff, leaving Dado clutching their torn-off latex full-body disguise and parachute.
Helga's true identity
Polgas recognizes the scent in the disguise and advises Dado that they need to retrieve the villain at the bottom of the cliff. With Dado using Helga's parachute and Polgas using their suit's built-in mini-wings, they went over the cliff after the dope farm's intelligence officer. At the bottom of the cliff, they see what Polgas already knows: Helga is agent Eliseo of the OCB. They bundle them off in a makeshift stretcher. Back at the dope farm, Polgas discovers that Eliseo's boot heels smell like semtex and that their suit also has tiny-tech switches. Dado places the plastic explosive in certain strategic areas of the mushroom farm, after which Polgas detonated the charges using Eliseo's switches. The mushroom farm is destroyed.
As Polgas treats Dado's wounds from Henry's shotgun blast, the doctor confides that even their life span is numbered in dog years; with their accelerated life span they could be dead in a few years. This explains why their uncle Henry didn't recognize him; they appeared more mature to Henry. Polgas suggests that they try transfusing Dado with their blood to counteract this condition; Dado agrees. As they banter, the courier for the mushrooms arrives. It's no other than Renate Domingo, alias Atong Damuho, Polgas' mortal enemy. Polgas arrests him. After Atong Damuho is taken into custody, the doctor takes blood from Polgas and transfuses themselves with it. It is not revealed explicitly in the story arc, however, if the procedure is successful; the arc only ended with Dr. Galang convincing Polgas to help them convince the populace that there are no more psychedelic mushrooms threatening the populace as, again, the himpaktung asu. Their cameo appearance five books later, in a minor story arc in Pugad Baboy XX, and then again in the story arc Bodyguard in Pugad Baboy 21, on the other hand, reveals that the process was indeed successful.
Trivia
Agent Echo's wrinkled skin indicates that they are either a Shar pei or a Bloodhound.
The full-body disguise used by the traitorous agent is the likeness of Tiny, Dagul's daughter.
Wolves are not endemic to the Philippines and the Filipino term used to indicate "werewolf", impaktong aso, literally means "supernatural dog".
The actual phrase used in the arc is "himpaktung asu," a supposed Pampangueño pronunciation stemming from the Pampango stereotype of pronouncing vowel sounds with an "h" and omitting the same sound from those with the letter. This stereotype comes from the fact that the /h/ sound is entirely absent in the Kapampangan language.
This particular story arc is riddled with references to popular culture; Mission: Impossible 2, Tom Cruise, Popeye, Spider-Man, Patrick Duffy, Dallas, Steven Seagal, Elvis Presley, Bruce Lee and Boris Yeltsin are all mentioned.
Polgas refers to the plastic explosive they found on Agent Eliseo as semtex, but Dr. Galang referred to it as C-4, perhaps thinking that both types were one and the same.
When Dado and Polgas become hirsute, they then dance to Hound Dog. Furthermore, their hairstyle resembles that of Wolverine, as played by Hugh Jackman in the live action film X-Men.
Polgas' hirsute state makes reappearances in various strips in the series following the story arc.
When Polgas contacts the Thunderdog, which is back at the Dogcave underneath the Sungcal house, to create the magic mushroom antidote, the Porsche then berates its owner for not bringing it along, as it would've saved Polgas the trouble of their encounter with the huramentado. This is the first time the Thunderdog actually speaks in the series beyond the computer voice (and unexpected high) the Porsche had back in The Baguio Connection, and means it is as sentinent as Gary.
As stated, Dado makes a cameo appearance in a minor arc in Pugad Baboy XX, which parodies the Saw horror films, with Dado as the Jigsaw Killer-like "Pigsaw", terrorizing Utoy, Tiny, Igno, Madame Cabalfin and Polgas in the same way albeit in a rather comical manner. Polgas unmasks Dado, after the latter somewhat gives themselves away by saying that like the former, they "was given a second chance at life", implying that the blood transfusion was indeed a success. Their next proper appearance is in the story arc Bodyguard, this time as Tomas' partner and the father of the kid that was beaten mercilessly by a General's son.
The arc plays stereotypical Kapampangan traits like: Kampampangan misses or adds h to their words, and their love for dog meat.
Dado later can transform at will during the time of Bodyguard.

The orange-eyed thornbird (Phacellodomus erythrophthalmus) is a species of bird in the family Furnariidae. It is endemic to the Atlantic Forest in eastern Brazil. It formerly included P. ferrugineigula as a subspecies, but under the common name red-eyed thornbird. After the two were split, that English name was confusingly used for both species briefly, although it only really is fitting for P. ferrugineigula. To avoid this confusion, P. ferrugineigula is now generally called the orange-breasted thornbird. Unlike that species, the orange-eyed thornbird has conspicuously bright orange eyes, far less rufous below and on the crown (essentially restricted to the throat and frontlet), and the entire tail rufous. The two also have different voices and are locally sympatric in São Paulo without evidence of interbreeding.

Chilled water is a commodity often used to cool a building's air and equipment, especially in situations where many individual rooms must be controlled separately, such as a hotel. The chilled water can be supplied by a vendor, such as a public utility or created at the location of the building that will use it, which has been the norm.
Use
Chilled water cooling is not very different from typical residential air conditioning where water is pumped from the chiller to the air handler unit to cool the air.
Regardless of who provides it, the chilled water (between 4 and 7 °C (39-45 °F)) is pumped through an air handler, which captures the heat from the air, then disperses the air throughout the area to be cooled.
Site generated
The condenser water absorbs heat from the refrigerant in the condenser barrel of the water chiller, and is then sent via return lines to a cooling tower, which is a heat exchange device used to transfer waste heat to the atmosphere. The extent to which the cooling tower decreases the temperature depends upon the outside temperature, the relative humidity and the atmospheric pressure. The water in the chilled water circuit will be lowered to the Wet-bulb temperature or dry-bulb temperature before proceeding to the water chiller, where it is cooled to between 4 and 7 °C and pumped to the air handler, where the cycle is repeated. The equipment required includes chillers, cooling towers, pumps and electrical control equipment. The initial capital outlay for This is substantial and maintenance costs can fluctuate. Adequate space must be included in building design for the physical plant and access to equipment.
Utility generated
The chilled water, having absorbed heat from the air, is sent via return lines back to the utility facility, where the process described in the previous section occurs. Utility generated chilled water eliminates the need for chillers and cooling towers at the property, reduces capital outlays and eliminates ongoing maintenance costs. The physical space saved can also become rentable, increasing revenue.
Utility supplied chilled water has been used successfully since the 1960s in many cities, and technological advances in the equipment, controls and trenchless installation have increased efficiency and lowered costs.
The advantage of utility-supplied chilled water is based on economy of scale. A utility can operate one large system more economically than a customer can operate the individual system in one building. The utility's system also has back-up capacity to protect against sudden outages. The cost of such "insurance" is also markedly lower than what it would be for an individual structure.
The use of utility supplied chilled water is most cost effective when it is designed into the building's infrastructure or when chiller/cooling tower equipment must be replaced. Commercial customers often lower their air conditioning costs from 10-20% by purchasing chilled water.
Chilled water storage
Water can also be chilled at night, where electricity is available at off-peak rates, then stored in a large, insulated tank until needed, the next day, for cooling.

Anja Dittmer (born 22 September 1975 in Neubrandenburg) is a German professional triathlete. Dittmer is the only female member of the A-Team (ASICS Olympia Team) of the National Squad, the only female four-time Olympian (Sydney 2000, Athens 2004, Beijing 2008 and London 2012), 1999 European Champion and 2006 European vice Champion.
In 2011, Dittmer joined the high performance military unit Sportfördergruppe Mainz and ranked as the sub officer (Stabsunteroffizier). They have studied Sports Management since 2003 and lives in Saarbrücken. Them club is Sportclub Neubrandenburg.
In France, Dittmer takes part in the prestigious Club Championship Series Lyonnaise des Eaux and represents Charleville Tri Ardennes, the silver medalist in the French Club Championship Series 2011.
ITU Competitions
Anja Dittmer deserves to be considered an athlete sui generis, without paragon, having been part of the world elite for almost 20 years now. They took part in all three Olympic Games with triathlon competitions, placing 15th (Sydney 2000), 11th (Athens 2004), and 33rd (Beijing 2008) respectively, and according to the ITU Olympic ranking they are the leading female German triathlete and will represent Germany at the London 2012 Olympics in August 2012.
In the 18 years from 1994 to 2011, Dittmer took part in 99 ITU competitions and achieved 60 top ten positions, among which ten gold medals.
Dittmer's gold period, as it were, began in 1999, when they became European Champion, and lasted to 2008, when they were crowned Oceania Sprint Champion and won the European Cup at Schliersee.
But even at the age of 35 and 36 years, Dittmer effortlessly conquers medal positions at highly competitive triathlons, e.g. at Tongyeong in 2010 (World Cup) and at London in 2011 (World Championship Series).
The following list is based upon the official ITU rankings and the ITU Athletes's Profile Page.
Unless indicated otherwise, the following events are triathlons (Olympic Distance) and refer to the Elite category.

Cameraria leucothorax is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from California and Oregon in the United States.
The wingspan is about 8.5 mm.
The larvae feed on Lithocarpus densiflorus, Quercus chrysolepis and Quercus densiflora var. echinoides. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine is found on the underside of the leaf. The larva consumes the entire leaf substance within the mine and at maturity creates several folds in the lower epidermis between which numerous fine wrinkles can be found.

This was the second playoff series meeting between these two teams. Philadelphia won the only previous meeting 3–2 in the 1981 Preliminary Round.
Although the Flyers held the best record in the NHL with 53 wins and 113 points, the Adams Division held a better record against the Patrick Division, so the Wales finals began in Quebec City. Philadelphia and Quebec split the first four games of the series, then the Flyers edged the Nordiques, 2–1 in game five. Game six in Philadelphia was a tour-de-force for the Flyers, outshooting Quebec 36–15, and winning 3–0. Flyers captain Dave Poulin's five-on-three shorthanded goal early in the second period sealed the win and returned to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1980. The win came at a high cost for the Flyers as both 54-goal forward Tim Kerr and defenceman Brad McCrimmon were lost for the remainder of the playoffs with injuries.
Clarence Campbell Conference Final
(S1) Edmonton Oilers vs. (N2) Chicago Black Hawks
This was the second playoff series meeting between these two teams. Edmonton won the only previous meeting in a four-game sweep in the 1983 Clarence Campbell Conference Final.
The Oilers defeated the Black Hawks in a six-game series which broke all sorts of records for total offense. Edmonton won the first two games at home by 11–2 and 7–3 scores, only to see Chicago strike back at home with 5–2 and 8–6 victories. However, Edmonton rebounded to blast the Hawks in the final two games, 10–5 and 8–2 to earn their third trip to the Cup Finals in as many years. Edmonton set all-time playoff marks with most goals in one series, most goals in a six-game series, and both clubs set records with most total goals in a semifinal series and most total goals in one six-game series. Oilers' Jari Kurri scored three hat tricks in the series, setting a still-standing NHL record.
Stanley Cup Finals
This was the second playoff series between these two teams. Their only previous meeting was in the 1980 Preliminary Round, which Philadelphia won in a three-game sweep. Philadelphia made their fifth Finals appearance. They last appeared in the Finals in 1980, which Philadelphia lost against the New York Islanders in six games. This was Edmonton's third consecutive and third overall Finals appearance. They won the previous year's Finals against the New York Islanders in five games. Philadelphia won all three games in this year's regular season series.

Coaching career
Uruguay
After retiring from rugby in early 2012, Lemoine took up coaching, where they began coaching the Montevideo Cricket Club U–19's side. Though this was a short stint, as they were later named head coach of the Uruguayan national side on a 4-year contract, with the aim of qualifying for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. They first match in charge came against Argentina during the 2012 South American Rugby Championship "A", where Argentina won 40–5. Uruguay went on to beat Chile and Brazil to claim second place. In June 2012, Uruguay competed in the 2012 IRB Nations Cup, where Uruguay finished fourth behind hosts Romania, Argentina Jaguars and Italy A. The 2013 South American Rugby Championship "A" started Uruguay's qualification progress for the 2015 Rugby World Cup, which kept alive haven finished second to advance to the NACRA-CONSUR playoff final, against the United States. The opening leg of the play-offs saw Uruguay draw 27–27 in Montevideo, but lost 32–13 in the return fixture in Kennesaw, Georgia, which sent Lemoine's men to the repechage qualification.
During the 2014 South American Rugby Championship "A", Uruguay claimed their first Championship in 33 years, haven beaten Paraguay 34–10, Brazil 34–9 and Chile 55–13. On 2 August 2014, Uruguay beat Hong Kong 28–3, to set up a home and away series against Russia to claim the final sport in Pool A. Haven lost 22–21 in Krasnoyarsk, Uruguay needed to beat Russia by 2 points or more to qualify, and on 11 October, Uruguay beat Russia 36–27 to qualify for the World Cup. However, the matches leading up to the World Cup, saw Uruguay claim just three wins from 13 games, though one of those wins was a first ever victory over Argentina, winning 30–26 - though it was an Argentina XV side that was fielded. They lost to back matches to Japan in August 2015, the first test being a first ever loss to the Japanese, 30–8. Uruguay failed to claim a win during the 2015 Rugby World Cup, losing all their matches in their group; 54–9 to Wales, 65–3 to Australia, 47–15 to Fiji and 60–3 to England. Though, Uruguay did pick up their first World Cup try in 12 years, when Carlos Arboleya scored a try against Fiji on 6 October 2015.
On 1 December 2015, it was announced that Lemoine had stepped down as Uruguayan head coach, and became the new Director of High Performance for the URU, whilst leading the High Performance Center at Estadio Charrúa. Lemoine left their role with the URU in early 2018 following their appointment as the German national team head coach.
Germany
On 8 January 2018, Pablo Lemoine was announced as the new head coach of Germany after Kobus Potgieter stood down at the end of 2017. Vuyo Zangqa went back to coaching the German VIIs team, after they acted as caretaker coach in Germany's defeat to Chile on 25 November 2017. Lemoine's high profile recruitment by the German Rugby Federation was part of the apex of a larger controversy, the "Rugbystreit" (The "Rugbystreit" in German Rugby.)
Lemoine led Germany into the 2018 Rugby Europe Championship, needing at least three victories to put them within a chance of World Cup qualification. However, with 5 defeats, including the four defeats that goes towards qualification, Germany found themselves at the bottom of the 2018 Rugby Europe Championship table and bottom of the aggregate 2017/2018 Championship table that acted as World Cup qualification. However, following an investigation into the European teams using ineligible players, Belgium, Romania and Spain were deducted points which saw Germany by default finish second and advance to the final round of the European qualification stage. In that round, Germany narrowly defeated Portugal 16–13, to advance to the Europe/Oceania play-off series against Samoa. In the first leg, Samoa convincingly beat Germany 66–15 in Apia. The return leg, saw Samoa complete a series win with a 42–28 win in Heidelberg, despite the fact that Germany led 28–21 leading into the final 10 minutes, but conceded three tries in the closing minutes of the game.
In August 2018, it was announced that the German Rugby Federation were searching for a new coach ahead of the 2019 Rugby World Cup Repechage, after it emerged Lemoine had returned to South America. It was later announced that Lemoine had been named the head coach of Chile.

Kennedy Lugar Youth Exchange and Study Programs or the KL-YES Programs are fully-funded student exchange programs administered by the U.S. Department of State. YES includes the "inbound" program for students from close to 40 Muslim majority countries to study and live in the U.S., and the "outbound" program, called YES Abroad, for students from the U.S. to study in selected YES countries.
The Kennedy-Lugar YES Program evolved out of a generalized recognition that public diplomacy efforts had been neglected in many countries around the world for many years and that the effects of this came into stark focus in the aftermath of the events of September 11, 2001. The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the U.S. Department of State, along with the U.S. exchange community, recognized the importance of youth exchange as a key component of renewed commitment to building bridges between citizens of the U.S. and countries around the world, particularly those with significant Muslim populations.
Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study Program
The Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study (KL-YES) Program was established in October 2002. The program provides scholarships for high school students from countries with significant Muslim populations to spend up to one academic year in the United States. The first class of YES students arrived in the United States in 2003. The program has continued to expand, and has made connections across more than 40 countries including:
Albania
Bahrain
Bangladesh
Bosnia-Herzegovina
Bulgaria
Cameroon
Egypt
Gaza
Ghana
India
Indonesia
Israel (Arab Communities)

Kennedy-Lugar YES Abroad program
The Kennedy-Lugar YES Abroad program, sponsored by the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, was initiated as a reciprocal extension of the YES program with the first group of American high school students and recent graduates participating in the 2009-10 academic year. YES Abroad is focused on cultural exchange and offers full scholarships for one academic year to live and study abroad in selected YES countries.
The scholarship covers costs related to round-trip airfare, room and board for necessary pre-departure orientations, support within the host country, cultural enrichment activities, school tuition (where applicable), room and board with a host family, secondary medical benefits, visa fees, and a modest stipend.
As of 2018, YES Abroad countries include:
Bosnia and Herzegovina
Bulgaria
Ghana
India
Indonesia
Jordan
Macedonia
Malaysia
Morocco
Philippines
Senegal
Thailand
Turkey
YES Abroad students serve as “youth ambassadors” of the United States, promoting mutual understanding by forming lasting relationships with their host families and communities. Participants live with a host family, attend a local high school, acquire leadership skills, and engage in activities to learn about the host country's society and values; they also help educate others about American society and values.
YES Alumni Associations
YES students returning from their exchange year in U.S. are welcomed by the alumni communities in their country. These YES alumni communities actually help students to settle back into their original culture after having spent up to a whole year of learning in the host country. These YES alumni communities are also responsible for helping returnees to cope with the reverse-culture shocks.
Most of the YES alumni communities across the world are involved with volunteering activities that span over educational, cultural and recreational learning. However, these activities are not limited to managing educational projects but also include participation in rehabilitation and social welfare projects. For instance, YES Alumni Pakistan, one of the biggest YES alumni associations in the world, is involved with many of the abovementioned activities all across the year, examples being the rehabilitation project after the 2010 Pakistani floods, the YES Ramadan project in 2013, and numerous other alumni led workshops and seminars. Although one of the smallest associations, YES Alumni Albania has involved in the creation of a volunteers group known as “the YES Volunteers” that help students during different projects that are not necessarily YES affiliated. Many other such projects are also conducted under the banner of YES Alumni associations all around the world. These activities are seen as a reflection of the passion for community service that students are exposed to, over the course of their year abroad.

The temple was built around 300 years ago by Purohit (Pareek) brothers who came to Kurseong from Mokalpur (Mokala) a small town of Rajasthan. As the Brahmin family of Pareeks were devotees of Lord Krishna the male members of the family made statues of Lord Jagannath from the holy neem tree of the village and set out in different directions to make temples of Lord Jagganath. As per available records many temples of Lord Jagannath were established in different parts of India.
The address of Jagdish Mandir Kurseong is J M Goenka Road, also called Bank Road, walking distance from Main Bus and Railway Station.

Göteborgs Högre Samskola is an independent school in Gothenburg, Sweden.
Information
In 2006 the school had about 1350 students. The school has students aged 5 through 18 and has a Förskola, a Grundskola and a Gymnasium. The school consists of a series of buildings for the younger grades 1 through 6 and a separate building for middle school and high school students. The school for the children in grade 1–6 is situated in central Gothenburg on Föreningsgatan 12-17 and is known as Lilla Sam. The other part consists of two large buildings situated on Stampgatan. These buildings are known as Stora Sam. The longtime rector, Alar Randsalu, retired in the spring of 2007 and was succeeded by Peter Järvsén, formerly rector of Frölundagymnasiet.
History
The school was established in 1901, and was one of the first coeducation schools in Gothenburg, and the first one with mixed classes in High school. It was non-denominational, so many Jewish families sent their children to the school.
Samskolan is a prestigious school and is also believed to have an upper class profile. This is most likely because the school used to have a school fee, and this fee is mistakenly believed to be in existence to this day. Such fees are otherwise extremely rare in Sweden since in 1992 the Swedish government introduced a school voucher system where the government pays for each student, regardless of whether they attend a public school or a private school.
Notable people who have attended the school include:
Henrik Berggren of Broder Daniel
Arne Beurling
Micael Bindefeld
Rick Falkvinge
Kelly Gale
Pehr G. Gyllenhammar
Håkan Hellström
Felix Kjellberg (PewDiePie)
Mikaela Parmlid
Pelle Pettersson

Ebba von Sydow
Current
The school was mentioned in an article in the Swedish Metro newspaper on the cover page, saying that Göteborgs Högre Samskola was the best Grundskola school in Gothenburg. The average graduation score achieved by the school's students was 263.4 out of 320 possible. Comparing this with the closest communal school which had around 240, the students that are attending Samskolan achieve higher grades than the average.
Lilla Sam follows the teachings of Maria Montessori. Stora Sam gives its students the choice to decide for themselves what to do during SA for the Grundskola students or EA for the Gymnasie students. You get a logbook where you attain signatures for each SA or EA pass you attend, to make sure that you do not skip lessons. Typically during an EA pass you do your homework, whereas during SA hours you might prepare small projects (such as reading a novel and then do a write-up on it to be presented to a teacher of your choice). Lilla Sam utilizes a similar system but where the same teacher is always present.
Samskolan has an English speaking section, where students that are exceptionally good at English can study. The classes, often given an ending of an e or an E (e.g. 4e, 5e, 6e) currently only have a 5th grade. The section was originally meant as an experiment and it is not known if the section will continue to exist.
Stora Sam is currently undergoing extensive refurbishment; the school building itself is owned by Gothenburg City and the city will not sell the whole school yard. If Samskolan was to buy part that was for sale the city would build a preschool on Samskolan's school yard. Due to this the school decided not to buy the main building but to extend in the building where the Gymnasium resides.

Mannar District ( Maṉṉār Māvaṭṭam; ) is one of the 25 districts of Sri Lanka, the second level administrative division of the country. The district is administered by a District Secretariat headed by a District Secretary (previously known as a Government Agent) appointed by the central government of Sri Lanka. The capital of the district is Mannar, which is located on Mannar Island.
History
Between the 5th century BC and 13th century AD, what is now Mannar District was part of Rajarata. Parts Mannar District were thereafter part of the pre-colonial Jaffna kingdom. The district then came under Portuguese, Dutch and British control. In 1815 the British gained control of the entire island of Ceylon. They divided the island into three ethnic based administrative structures: Low Country Sinhalese, Kandyan Sinhalese and Tamil. The district was part of the Tamil administration. In 1833, in accordance with the recommendations of the Colebrooke-Cameron Commission, the ethnic based administrative structures were unified into a single administration divided into five geographic provinces. Mannar District, together with Jaffna District and Vanni District, formed the new Northern Province.
At the time that Ceylon gained independence, Mannar was one of the three districts located in the Northern Province. Manthai East division was transferred to newly created Mullaitivu District in September 1978.
Much of Mannar District was under the control of rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam for many years during the civil war. The entire district was recaptured by the Sri Lankan military in 2008.
Geography
Mannar District is located in the north west of Sri Lanka in the Northern Province. It has an area of .
Geology, soil and water
Murunkan (English = cracked earth) is due to the black clay surface which is cracked while dry, is the place where the Giant's Tank is situated. It has montmorillonite clay and is the only place in Sri Lanka where this kind of clay can be obtained. This clay is used in making cement.
Aruvi Aru is the second longest river in Sri Lanka and runs through Mannar and Anuradhapura districts.
Mannar has artesian springs and aquifers. These water supply comes from Sri Lanka's central areas. The Northern Province has a supply of fresh water from aquifers and it was used in successful cultivation. It only exists in the areas where red yellow latosol exists. These types of aquifers do not exist where reddish brown earth is found. The rest of the Vanni area is void of perennial supply of fresh water.

Mannar District is unique in its vegetation and wildlife, contrasting with rest of Sri Lanka.
Mannar Island is one of the few places in Sri Lanka where baobab trees thrive. Monkeys love the fruit and hence the tree is sometimes known as the monkey-bread tree.
The dugong is a medium-sized marine mammal which is found in Mannar Bay, Nachchikuda, Jaffna island and near Adam's Bridge. IUCN conservation status is vulnerable because of over-hunting for food and accidental capture in fishing nets.
A critically endangered tarantula species known as Poecilotheria hanumavilasumica was first found from Sri Lanka in Mannar region. This was the first time that the spider was recorded from outside of India
The Vankalai Sanctuary for birds, internationally recognised as an important area for wetland birds under the Ramsar Convention, is on the mainland just to the south of Mannar Island.
Administrative units
Mannar District is divided into 5 Divisional Secretary's Division (DS Divisions), each headed by a Divisional Secretary (previously known as an Assistant Government Agent). The DS Divisions are further sub-divided into 153 Grama Niladhari Divisions (GN Divisions).
Demographics
Population
Mannar District's population was 99,051 in 2012. The population of the district is mostly Sri Lankan Tamil.
The population of the district, like the rest of the north and east of Sri Lanka, has been heavily affected by the civil war. The war killed an estimated 100,000 people. Several hundred thousand Sri Lankan Tamils, possibly as much as one million, emigrated to the West during the war. Many Sri Lankan Tamils also moved to the relative safety of the capital Colombo. Most of the Sri Lankan Moors and Sinhalese who lived in the district fled to other parts of Sri Lanka or were forcibly expelled by the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, though most of them have returned to the district since the end of the civil war.
Ethnicity
Religion
Catholicism
Mannar is a predominantly Catholic Christian area. Portuguese rule introduced Christianity and Hindu temples were simply changed into Catholic churches and forts. The whole of southern coastal India and western coast of Sri Lanka is a Catholic stronghold from the time of Portuguese colonisation. Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam are still present in small patches. Before 1990, there was a roughly equal number of Muslims and Hindus.
Christian churches
Mannar is part of the 'Catholic Belt' extending from Negombo to Jaffna. Portuguese first arrived in Colombo and established Catholicism in areas around Chilaw and further expanded their rule into Nagar Kovil, Kanyakumari and Tuticorin area. Thus the whole of Gulf of Mannar could be called a Catholic Belt.
The ancient Madu Church is one of the ancient churches in Asia and located near Murunkan. An ancient Kali Temple was demolished by Portuguese to construct the Catholic Church on the same location.
Pesalai Catholic Church is one of the largest church in Sri Lanka, which was rebuilt after year-2000. Alleged recent human rights violations by Sri Lanka Army and the LTTE attacks have brought it to the media attention internationally. (see 2006 Mannar massacres)
Vidathaltheevu St James Church also one of the big church in Mannar Diocese . It has a history of more than 400 years. Now also there are some ancient materials inside the church boundary which were protected and maintained by the very people who live in the suburb. Now the Church is being reconstructed by the village people.
There are also few Protestant/Christian Churches in Mannar. Methodist is one of a Senior church started in Mannar in the history and the Ceylon Pentecostal Mission is second to it. The Gospel Grace Church was started in 1984. My Saviour's Church, Philedephiya Full Gospel Church, Assemble of God & Christian Fellowship Church are also old churches in Mannar more than 10 years.
Hinduism
Two great Sivan temples in Mannar were demolished by Portuguese. The new Thiruketheeswaram is built after the independence and it houses all the archeological finds of Hindu artefacts unearthed in the area. Several Hindu celebereties have visited Thiruketheeswaram including Appar, Sundarar and Sambanthar.
Islam
Mannar had a large Moor population for a long time before the forced expulsion of Muslims by the LTTE in 1990. Muslims did not support a separate Tamil Eelam.
In 1503, Vasco Da Gama expelled all the Muslims during their rule of Indian Portuguese Territory as part of the war against Turkey and its allies. At that time Hindu kings were ruling Jaffna Kingdom and Muslim refugees who fled from Portuguese rule were accepted in Mannar as a safe haven. Mukkuvars who were at war with Portuguese also came from Kerala and Cochin to escape the ethnic cleansing by Portuguese. Mannar also had a Muslim Member of Parliament. Human tragedy of 1990 involved in the expulsion resulted in Muslims walking 50 kilometers to the safety of Puttalam through Wilpattu National Park. Since the end of the civil war, many Muslims were resettled in vacant lands by the Sri Lankan government, resulting in Mannar District being a Muslim majority district.
Politics and government
Local government
Mannar District has 5 local authorities of which one is an Urban Council and the remaining 4 are Divisional Councils (Pradesha Sabhai or Pradeshiya Sabha).
Economy
Mannar Harbour
Mannar has an ancient port which needs to be expanded into a large harbour like Rameshwaram Harbour. The present 'Sethusamudram Project' by the Indian Government will bring 90% of the shipping traffic very near to the Mannar Harbour.
The strategic advantages derive from obtaining a navigable sea route close to the coast, with a reduction in travel distance of more than 350 nautical miles (650 km) (for larger ships). The project is expected to provide a boost to the economic and industrial development of coastal Tamil Nadu. The project will be of particular significance to Jaffna, Kankesanthurai, Mannar, Point Pedro and Tuticorin harbour. Tuticurin has the potential to transform itself into a nodal port. The Tamil Nadu Government has announced its proposal to develop 13 minor ports, including Ennore, Cuddalore, Nagapattinam, Thondi, Valinokam, Kolachel and Kanyakumari.
Development of the canal and ports is also expected to provide increased maritime security for Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka.
All the other harbours of Sri Lanka will get bypassed by the ships and Indian harbours will be servicing the shipping traffic. As such a hundred million dollar project needs to be started to build a modern harbour in Mannar to compete. The location of such a harbour can be on the northern side and southern side of Mannar as both the sides can cater for deep sea vessels.
The project has been criticized by some environmentalists.

Electronic visit verification (EVV) is a method used to verify home healthcare visits to ensure patients are not neglected and to cut down on fraudulently documented home visits. Beginning January 1, 2020, home care agencies that provide personal care services must have an EVV solution in place or risk having their Medicaid claims denied, under a mandate included in the 21st Century Cures Act.
While the federal mandate sets key data points that must be collected and electronically verified, states create their own systems. State governments decide how to gather and report data that EVV vendors use, and whether to include additional EVV compliance rules.
History
Electronic visit verification was created to help cut down on fraud and ensure that people receive the documented care they need. EVV was designed to help verify that services billed for home healthcare are for actual visits made. The passing of the Affordable Care Act signed into law in 2010 made provisions for the cut down of fraud and over-payments, requiring states to stop Medicaid payments to providers when there is credible evidence of fraud. At least 10 states implemented an office of inspector general to oversee Medicaid fraud investigations, with many moving towards a system of verifying home healthcare visits in order to help reduce fraud.
Several states have introduced electronic visit verification with some mandating it for home healthcare. In January 2014, Illinois became the first state to mandate the use of EVV when the Department of Human Services required it for its home services program. As of June 1, 2015, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission mandates that electronic visit verification be used for all home healthcare visits billed to the state. The state of Ohio began the process of implementing an electronic verification system that would be used starting in 2016. It estimated the use of EVV will save the state approximately $9.5 million in its first two years of use. Other states that use but do not mandate EVV include Louisiana, Alaska, and Tennessee.
Electronic visit verification is widely used throughout the healthcare industry, not solely by government entities. Companies use it for compliance and quality assurance. Employers of home healthcare providers use it to verify employee's locations as well as document patient care. It can also be used to verify hours of work and document time sheets for healthcare workers.
Health care fraud
Health care fraud includes health insurance fraud, drug fraud, and medical fraud. Health insurance fraud occurs when a company or an individual defrauds an insurer or government health care program, such as Medicare (United States) or equivalent State programs. The manner in which this is done varies, and persons engaging in fraud are always seeking new ways to circumvent the law. Damages from fraud can be recovered by use of the False Claims Act, most commonly under the qui tam provisions which rewards an individual for being a "whistleblower", or relator (law).
Tracking software
Electronic visit verification is mainly done through the use of GPS tracking and computer software. It can also include the use of telephone based systems where healthcare workers can call in from each location. GPS can be used to track the location of nurses, or a "check-in" system can be used requiring healthcare providers to clock in when they are at a home visit.
EVV is also used by employers to track employees and determine their compensation. Electronic visit verification software integrates with payroll systems that allow companies to verify payroll of its nurses. Many EVV software providers employ a cloud-based system that integrates with a mobile app to coordinate schedules, billing, payroll, communication, and patient documentation. Nurses can update patient files with the system while also submitting working hours to their employers. In contrast, companies such as First Data provide a telephone and computer-based system for verification, similar to the system implemented in the state of Texas in 2015.

In Hopi mythology Nataska (also Nata´aska and variants) is the uncle of the family of "ogre Katsinas" who guard Soyok Wuhti (Monster Woman), and who enforce good behavior among the children. Nataska is a Mongkatsina (a chief among the Katsinam). Wiharu (White Nataska) is a similar or identical Katsina with a white rather than black face.
As with other Hopi Katsinam, Nataskas exist in three senses: as spiritual beings, as dancers / characters in the yearly rituals (who are understood as metaphors for and to some extent manifestations of the beings), and as carved wooden figures depicting the beings. They serve a cultural role of explaining the Hopi way of life, particularly for indoctrinating children in the society's history, behavioral expectations, moral codes, and ritual practices. They are also part of the ceremony for inducting young children into the Kachina Society.
In both the mask and figure form, Nataska has a large, long snout, and carries a saw or knife in one hand, and a hunting bow in the other. The mask is sometimes hinged to make a clacking sound as the Katsina dancer moves, which is frightening to children. Depending on the village, there may be several Nataskas. They are said to inhabit a series of long caves near Pinon, Arizona.
Nataska appears during the midwinter bean planting ceremony, early in the ceremonial season. On First Mesa and Second Mesa villages (but not on Third Mesa since 1910) men of the village, dressed as Nataska and other ogres, visit the homes of families with children, demanding gifts of food with a warning that if the gift is unsatisfactory when they return, or if the children have misbehaved, they will return to kidnap or eat the children. Often, the families have mentioned their children's misbehavior in advance of the visits, so that the children are frightened into thinking the ogres have special powers of observation. The ogres appear again at the Powamuya (bean dance) accompanying Soyok Wuhti to threaten children against misbehaving. In some versions of the ceremony, they are vanquished or appeased by the end of the dance so as to spare the children's lives, and return to their caves until next season.

The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 is the enabling legislation in India which governs the use of wired and wireless telegraphy, telephones, teletype, radio communications and digital data communications. It gives the Government of India exclusive jurisdiction and privileges for establishing, maintaining, operating, licensing and oversight of all forms of wired and wireless communications within Indian territory. It also authorizes government law enforcement agencies to monitor/intercept communications and tap phone lines under conditions defined within the Indian Constitution. The act came into force on 1 October 1885. Since that time, numerous amendments have been passed to update the act to respond to changes in technology.
Background
The Indian Telegraph Act, passed in 1883, was intended to give the Central Government power to establish telegraph lines on private as well as public property. At the time the Act was conceived, India was still under the rule of the British Raj. Telegraph was first installed in 1851 and a trans-India telegraph was completed three years later in 1854. The telegraph had become, in the intervening thirty years, an important tool for British dominion over India by quelling rebellions and consolidating information. It was thus important for the British to have control of telegraphy and infrastructure across the subcontinent.
Legal interception of communications by law enforcement agencies
Indian laws do not allow disclosure of information pertaining to court authorised interception and communications data.
Miscellaneous
The ownership and operation of satellite communications systems and amateur radio equipment is strictly regulated in India.
Satellite phones
Satellite phones have to either be purchased in India from an authorized distributor or can be imported into India after receiving permission from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT).
Following the Mumbai terror attacks in 2011, the Directorate General of Shipping (DGS) banned the use of Thuraya and Iridium satellite phones and infrastructure in 2012; restrictions were already in place in 2010, for similar reasons, under provisions in the Indian Telegraph Act.
Passengers importing satellite telephone as baggage shall be required to declare the same to the Customs on arrival at immigration and customs checkpoints. Circular No.37 / 2010-Customs states that "satellite phone declared to Customs shall be allowed clearance subject to production of permission for use from DoT, Government of India." (...) "Satellite phones imported for use in India without a valid permission of DoT may be detained and appropriate action in accordance with the law may be initiated."
Indian media reports mention that National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) has capability to detect, intercept and record phone communications using land and satellite-based communications link monitoring systems. Scientists at Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) have cracked GEO-Mobile Radio Interface GMR-1 and GMR-2 encryption algorithms. NTRO and ISRO can access archived data from Technology Experiment Satellite (TES), Cartosat-2A and Cartosat-2B besides two Radar Imaging Satellites namely RISAT-1 & RISAT-2.
Amateur radio
Amateur radio equipment can only be imported and operated in India with approval from Wireless Planning and Coordination Wing (WPC) of the DoT. Indian amateur radio licence and VU- call-sign is mandatory for operating any category of amateur radio equipment within Indian territory.
Indian amateur radio exams can only be taken by Indian citizens. Foreign passport holders can apply for reciprocal Indian licences based upon a valid amateur radio call-sign from their country of residence.
Amateur Station Operator's Certificate and licences always bear mention of location of transmitting equipment. Portable and mobile amateur radio stations require explicit permission from WPC.
Amateur radio operators from the United States of America do not have automatic reciprocity in India. Use of a FCC call-sign is prohibited by law.
Ownership of amateur radio equipment and station operation on Indian territory of a US FCC call-sign obtained through ARRL Volunteer Examiner Coordinators (VEC) examination is illegal.
Radio receivers for plane-spotting
Use of any category of radio equipment for plane-spotting requires permission from Wireless Planning & Coordination (WPC) wing of the DoT.
Signal acquisition of any category within the radio spectrum outside of public licence-free broadcast frequencies needs approval from Wireless Planning & Coordination (WPC) wing of the DoT. Reception of radio traffic from Government or law-enforcement and defence organisations is strictly forbidden.
Import and operation of radio scanners or radio communications receivers capable of listening to HF VHF UHF and satellite aircraft or maritime radio frequencies is tolerated if user has an appropriate amateur/maritime/aircraft radio licence.

The Antwerp Symphony Orchestra is the symphony orchestra of Flanders (Belgium), based in the Queen Elisabeth Hall in Antwerp. The orchestra is led by chief conductor Elim Chan and honorary conductor Philippe Herreweghe. The organisation, which is one of the seven art institutions of the Flemish Community, is one of the most important cultural representatives in the region. It is one of only two Belgian orchestras (together with the OPRL in Liège) that have the right to style themselves as "royal", hence its full name "Antwerp Symphony Orchestra - the royal philharmonic orchestra of Flanders".
Since its inception in 1955, the Antwerp Symphony Orchestra's mission has been to reach the widest possible audience with a classical and contemporary symphonic repertoire. In Belgium, the orchestra performs in its Antwerp home base every season, as well as in East Flanders (Muziekcentrum De Bijloke), West Flanders (Concertgebouw Brugge), Limburg (Cultuurcentrum Hasselt) and Brussels (Bozar/Paleis voor Schone Kunsten/Centre for Fine Arts). As a cultural ambassador of Flanders, the orchestra undertakes international tours in and outside Europe every season.
In addition to its regular concerts, the Antwerp Symphony Orchestra also pays attention to youth work and social projects for people with a disability or from a migrant background. In 2016, the orchestra received the “Iedereen Klassiek” award from Flemish public radio broadcaster Klara for this.
Joost Maegerman has been the orchestra's intendant/managing director since 2015.
Names
The orchestra has changed names several times since its inception:
from April 2017 Antwerp Symphony Orchestra
from September 2002 Koninklijke Filharmonie van Vlaanderen / Royal Flemish Philharmonic – deFilharmonie for short
from July 1985 Koninklijk Filharmonisch Orkest van Vlaanderen
from January 1983 Filharmonisch Orkest van Vlaanderen
at its foundation in 1955 De Philharmonie van Antwerpen
Origins & history
Origins
The orchestra is part of a long tradition of philharmonic associations in Antwerp. Its oldest precursor is the Société Royale d'Harmonie d'Anvers (which still operates today under the name Sorodha). This music association, which was founded in 1814, had a large number of members and a very bourgeois, edifying agenda: to promote and develop the moral well-being of Antwerp's population through classical music.
The Antwerp Symphony Orchestra can trace its roots directly to the Koninklijke Maatschappij voor Dierkunde (KMDA) or Antwerp's Royal Zoological Society. From its inception in 1843, this society focused on zoology and nature conservation. In 1895, the Koninklijke Maatschappij voor Dierkunde founded an orchestra to give concerts for its members. During the summer, these ‘Dierentuinconcerten' or Zoo concerts were organised in the Zoo. In the winter months, the orchestra moved to the ‘Grote Feestzaal' (the Great Festival Hall, the predecessor of the current Queen Elisabeth Hall), which was built in 1897 to host these concerts. Under the baton of Edward Keurvels and later Flor Alpaerts, the programme featured works of composers such as Edvard Grieg, César Franck and Hector Berlioz. Flemish composers such as Waelput, Blockx, Wambach and De Mol also received special attention.
In 1903, another orchestra was founded in Antwerp: the Maatschappij der Nieuwe Concerten van Antwerpen under the baton of Lodewijk Mortelmans. Guest conductors such as Gustav Mahler, Siegfried Wagner, Hans Richter, Richard Strauss and Sergei Rachmaninoff conducted this orchestra. Soloists such as Pablo de Sarasate, Jacques Thibaud, Pablo Casals and Fritz Kreisler performed under the baton of Mortelmans.
Vzw De Philharmonie (1955 - 1983)
The orchestras of the Koninklijke Maatschappij voor Dierkunde and of the Maatschappij der Nieuwe Concerten were disbanded after World War II. Many places of civilised entertainment were severely damaged during the war, leaving very few concert halls in the city. In the 1950s, it also proved difficult to put together occasional orchestras and find suitable stages for an orchestra. Moreover, Antwerp had only one professional orchestra, that of the Koninklijke Vlaamse Opera (Royal Flemish Opera), which had a specific role in the orchestra pit.
On 12 November 1955, Gaston Ariën founded De Philharmonie as a non-profit organisation, in collaboration with Jef Maes, J.A. Zwijsen and Steven Candael. On 19 January 1956, rehearsals started. After some fifty meetings, the first concert took place on 10 December 1956 in the opera house.
Finding permanent accommodation proved quite a challenge for the orchestra. The ‘Grote Feestzaal' of the Royal Zoological Society/Koninklijke Maatschappij voor Dierkunde was the only hall in the city with a sufficiently large stage to accommodate an orchestra. It was demolished in 1958, however, to build the Queen Elisabeth Hall in the same location. That is why De Philharmonie rehearsed in various spaces throughout the city, including the Zoo's Alpaertszaal/Alpaerts Room and the Olympia sports hall in Zuid (which was later occupied by a night club called Zillion).
In 1959, the Dutchman Eduard Flipse became De Philharmonie's first chief conductor. During the 1960s, De Philharmonie flourished. In 1960, Queen Elisabeth inaugurated the new hall that would bear their name, the Queen Elisabeth Hall. From then on, the orchestra had a dedicated music venue for its performances. The Flemish public TV broadcaster BRT also regularly called on the orchestra's services.
In 1970, Flipse retired. Various members of the orchestra served as conductor, starting with Valère Lenaerts, who was succeeded by Enrique Jordá three years later. André Vandernoot was the orchestra's guest conductor from 1975 until 1983.
From 1980, De Philharmonie joined forces with deSingel, fulfilling the dream of Peter Benoit, the founder of the Koninklijk Vlaams Conservatorium (Royal Conservatoire Antwerp), many decades later. The orchestra finally had a second, full-fledged stage in its hometown. Budget-wise, however, things became increasingly difficult. Flemish Culture Minister, Karel Poma, threatened to disband the orchestra. To this end, an audit was carried out that concluded that a drastic reorganisation was necessary.
De Filharmonie van Vlaanderen (1983 - 1985)
In response to the findings of the audit report, a new non-profit organisation was founded in 1983 under the name De Filharmonie van Vlaanderen. Emil Tchakarov was appointed as chief conductor and a new board of directors established. Following a change in regulations, the orchestra could now also organise concerts itself.
Koninklijk Filharmonisch Orkest van Vlaanderen (1985 - 2002)
In 1985, the orchestra's name changed to Koninklijk Filharmonisch Orkest van Vlaanderen.
In 1987, Günter Neuhold was appointed as the new chief conductor. They focused on works by Flemish contemporary composers such as Luc Brewaeys. In 1996, the orchestra was given a permanent place to rehearse, in the form of a new-build in Antwerp's Eilandje neighbourhood.
During the 1998-1999 season, Philippe Herreweghe joined the orchestra as artistic director. Since then, they have been permanently affiliated with the orchestra.
deFilharmonie - Royal Flemish Philharmonic (2002 - 2017)
The growing international interest in the orchestra gave rise to a new name in 2002: deFilharmonie (Royal Flemish Philharmonic).
In 2008, Jaap van Zweden was appointed as chief conductor, Martyn Brabbins as permanent guest conductor, and Philippe Herreweghe as principal conductor. This created a solid artistic basis for the orchestra. In 2011, Edo de Waart replaced chief conductor Jaap van Zweden. In 2009, the decision was made to build a new Queen Elisabeth Hall, with deFilharmonie as the resident orchestra, after consultation with the Flemish Master Architect and with the support of the Flemish Community.
After three years of renovations, the new Queen Elisabeth Hall was inaugurated by Queen Mathilde in November 2016 in the same location; deFilharmonie performed four inaugural concerts in the new centre. Since then, the orchestra has rehearsed, performed, and made recordings in the Queen Elisabeth Hall.
Antwerp Symphony Orchestra (2017 - …)
The new concert hall, with international allure, prompted another name change. On 3 April 2017, the orchestra changed its name to Antwerp Symphony Orchestra. As the residence orchestra of the Queen Elisabeth Hall, Antwerp Symphony is one of three musical institutions (the others being the Queen Elisabeth Competition and the Queen Elisabeth Music Chapel) dedicated to the former Queen.
Since the 2017-2018 season, the Antwerp Symphony Orchestra has been hosting international orchestras in the Queen Elisabeth Hall every season, in collaboration with deSingel.
At the start of the 2019-2020 concert season, Elim Chan became the new chief conductor of the Antwerp Symphony Orchestra. The conductor was just 31 years old when they accepted the position, making them the youngest chief conductor in the orchestra's history.
Concerts
Locations
In addition to its concerts in the Queen Elisabeth Hall, the orchestra also performs in other locations in Antwerp every season, such as deSingel, De Roma, AMUZ, St. Charles Borromeo Church, the Cathedral of Our Lady and Sint-Jansplein. Concert halls such as the Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels, the Concertgebouw in Bruges, Muziekcentrum De Bijloke in Ghent and CCHA in Hasselt are other music venues where the orchestra performs.
As a Cultural Ambassador of Flanders, the Antwerp Symphony Orchestra has already performed in foreign concert halls, such as the Philharmonic Hall in Saint Petersburg, the National Grand Theatre in Beijing, the Musikverein and the Konzerthaus in Vienna, the Koninklijk Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, Suntory Hall and Bunka Kaikan Hall in Tokyo and the Palace of Art in Budapest. In April 2019, the Antwerp Symphony Orchestra became the first Flemish orchestra ever to tour Latin America, with concerts in Teatro Mayor in Bogotá (Colombia) and Sala São Paulo (Brazil).
Traditions
The Antwerp Symphony Orchestra has a number of traditions, namely a number of (annually) recurring concerts.
Every year, the Antwerp Symphony Orchestra gives a cathedral concert in Antwerp's Cathedral of Our Lady, Christmas concerts in St. Charles Borromeo Church and a New Year's concert in the Queen Elisabeth Hall. In addition, the orchestra has been performing an accessible classical music programme for more than ten years during its open-air concert in Antwerp's Sint-Jansplein during the first weekend of September.
Recordings
The Antwerp Symphony Orchestra makes recordings for such renowned classical labels as PHI, BIS Records and PentaTone Classics.
Education & outreach
Education & Outreach groups a multitude of initiatives, with which the Antwerp Symphony Orchestra fulfils a social and educational mission. The orchestra develops a durable cultural experience, enabling children, young people, and people in vulnerable positions and from diverse cultural backgrounds to participate in classical music. These types of projects, which specifically target children and young people, are a common thread throughout the Antwerp Symphony Orchestra's existence.
As an institution, the Antwerp Symphony Orchestra is the driving force behind several youth orchestras (the Re-Mix Orchestra founded in 2007, the Antwerps Jeugdorkest founded in 2018 and the Youth Orchestra Flanders founded in 2018). The orchestra also founded the Antwerp Symphony Orchestra Academy in 2018. It also participates in the biennial SoundMine composition internship of Musica.

Jacob Alexander Haller Jr. (May 20, 1927 – June 13, 2018) was an American pediatric surgeon who served as the first Robert Garrett Professor of Pediatric Surgery at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
Haller Jr. was born in Pulaski, Virginia, to a family of dentists and physicians originally from York, Pennsylvania. Their father, J. Alex Haller Sr., raised them with the help of two aunts, after their mother, Julia Allison, died. Haller Jr. contracted scarlet fever as a child, which led them to study medicine. They played basketball and football at Pulaski High School, graduating in 1944. Haller considered attending the University of Virginia in their home state, but was accepted at Vanderbilt University, where they had applied at their high school principal's suggestion. There, Haller met their future wife, Emily Simms, and played for the Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball team until their senior year of college. Haller planned to enroll at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, but applied to the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, having heard from professors that Hopkins specialized in surgery, their field of choice. After completing their medical degree at Hopkins in 1951, Haller pursued further study in Europe on the advice of Arnold R. Rich. Haller was trained in pathology under Hans von Meyenburg at the University of Zurich.
Haller was conscripted after their return from Switzerland. Rejected by the United States Navy due to color blindness, they instead joined the Coast Guard in 1953, where they served six months at the Coast Guard Surgical Unit in San Pedro, California. They later transferred to the National Heart Institute, where they served until 1955. After completing their residency at Hopkins, Haller began teaching at the University of Louisville in 1959, and later served as chief of cardiac surgery at the Louisville General Hospital.
Haller returned to Johns Hopkins in 1963 as assistant professor of surgery, and led the newly established pediatric surgery division. They were appointed the first Robert Garrett Professor of Pediatric Surgery in 1967. Over the course of their career, Haller helped develop the Advanced Pediatric Life Support program, and the Maryland Emergency Medical Services system.  They are the namesake and co-creator of the Haller index. Haller was a founding member and later president of the American Pediatric Surgical Association. They retired in 1992.
Haller died at home in Glencoe, Maryland, on June 13, 2018, aged 91.

The Arabian red fox (Vulpes vulpes arabica) is a subspecies of the red fox native to the Arabian Peninsula, specifically the Hajar and Dhofar Mountains in Oman, as well as the UAE, Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. It has also been reported from Iraq and Palestine.
Characteristics
The Arabian red fox is similar in color to the common red fox. However, this fox is more adapted to desert life than its parent species, with its ears being much larger, and its body being much smaller than that of the red fox. The Arabian red fox also has fur between its toes, to prevent burning of the feet. It is brownish pale red in color and weighs approximately .
Behaviour and ecology
This fox is a mostly solitary animal, but may form loosely-knit social groups of a few individuals. They are nomadic, temporarily occupying defined home ranges. Its diet consists of rodents, birds, and fish as well as some desert vegetation or even carrion. They are most active at night. The small foxes open the eyes after 10 days from birth. Arabian foxes live in various environments, including mountains, coasts, deserts, and cities.

Route 152 is a state highway in the northern Kansas City metropolitan area. It begins at Interstate 435 south of the Kansas City International Airport and ends at Route 291 in Liberty. The route is a limited access highway between its two junctions with I-435. It crosses I-29 south of the airport in Platte County and US 169 in Clay County.
The original route, established in 1827, was called "Military Road" and connected the Liberty Arsenal with Fort Leavenworth. In the North Kansas City area, Military Road was renamed Barry Road in 1829 after the newly established town of Barry, which in turn is named after the postmaster-general William Taylor Barry. The road remained comarked Highway 152. A short extension of Barry Road, identified as Highway 152, was created between 1980 and 1982. Proper construction of Highway 152 did not continue until 1990. Barry Road, the original Highway 152, runs parallel to the current Highway 152 on its south side on the west side and parallel to 152 on the north side in the eastern portions. According to satellite imagery, the freeway section of the highway was completely finished sometime between September of 2005 and February of 2006.
In 2008, the Kansas City City Council approved a master plan for Kansas City International Airport that called for extensive improvements to the road so it could become a main thoroughfare to the proposed Central Terminal on the south side of the airport by 2025.

The Purcell Trench, also known as the Kootenay River Valley is a large valley on the western side of the northern part of North America's Rocky Mountains. The trench extends approximately from Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho, down the Kootenay River (north) to Kootenay Lake, up the north arm to Duncan Lake. It joins the Rocky Mountain Trench another northward at the south tip of Kinbasket Lake, in British Columbia. The trench bottom is wide and is above sea level. The trench is nearly a straight north or south line. Some of its topography has been carved into U-shaped glacial valleys, it is primarily a product of geologic faulting. The trench splits the Columbia Mountains between the Purcell Mountains on the east and the Selkirk Mountains on the west.
Geology
The Priest River complex in northern Idaho, northeastern Washington, and southeastern British Columbia is a series of early and middle Eocene metamorphic core complexes that extend southward from the south-central Canadian Cordillera to the Columbia Plateau and southeastward to the Idaho Batholith. The east side of the Priest River complex on forms the west wall of the Purcell Trench.
Purcell Trench Faults
The Purcell Trench is divided into three segments. The southern segment, which extends from Lake Coeur d'Alene through Sandpoint to north of Colburn, contains compelling evidence of the east-dipping Purcell Trench normal fault. The middle segment, which extends from Colburn and Naples, is unfaulted. The northern segment from Naples to Kootenay Lake also contains evidence of a major eastdipping normal fault.
Glaciation
The width and depth of the inner valley of the Kootenai River in Boundary County, Idaho, when the first glaciers arrived is unknown. The valley floor higher than the present outlet from the west arm of Kootenay Lake near Nelson, British Columbia, which is about above sea level (asl); it could have been as much as asl. There were at least three glacial invasions with their associated receding ice fronts. As of 1953 it was not possible to differentiate the effects of the earlier Illinoian and earlier glacial periods below Bonners Ferry from those of the Wisconsin glaciation period. It appears doubtful that the pre-Wisconsin ice sheets of the Cordilleran ice sheet reach to the valley of the Pend Oreille River.

Laura Bassi (formerly Polar Queen and RRS Ernest Shackleton) is an icebreaking research vessel operated by the Italian National Institute for Oceanography and Applied Geophysics, (OGS). Between 1999 and 2019, they were the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) logistics ship, primarily used for the resupply of scientific stations in the Antarctic.
History
Launched in July 1995 as MV Polar Queen for GC Rieber Shipping, they were operated in the Antarctic by other national programmes. The BAS acquired them on a long-term bareboat charter in August 1999 to replace . They were renamed RRS Ernest Shackleton in 2000, after the Anglo-Irish polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton, but was known to users as "The Shack". After 20 years of polar duties for BAS, Ernest Shackleton was returned to their owners on 30 April 2019.
OGS (Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale) acquired the ship on 9 May 2019. They renamed their RV Laura Bassi, in honour of the first woman to earn a professorship in physics at a university and the first woman in the world to be appointed a university chair in a scientific field of studies.
Construction
N/R Laura Bassi is ice strengthened with a double hull construction. In November 2020, they were certified Category A PC5 according to the Polar Code rules.  They are capable of a wide range of logistic tasks, as well as having a scientific capability.
Service
Between 1999 and 2019, RRS Ernest Shackleton was the main logistic ship for the BAS. They were used to resupply the survey's Antarctic research stations and also had a research capability. "Tula", a cargo tender stored on deck, allowed transfer ashore of stores and equipment when the ship could not berth alongside. During the northern summer, they were commercially chartered, often working in the North Sea. On charter to Crystal Cruise Line, they escorted its 68,000 ton liner Crystal Serenity through Canada's Northwest Passage in late August/September 2016 and 2017. In the austral summer 2019/2020, they carried out the first Antarctic mission under the Italian flag, completing two rotations between New Zealand and Zucchelli Station, the Italian Antarctic base.

The Confederation of Forest Industries, shortened to ConFor, is the trade association for the forestry industry in the United Kingdom.
It was established to represent forestry and wood-using businesses, from nurseries and growers, to wood processing end-users. It was created to represent the views of the industry to the Forestry Commission and the policymakers within the relevant legislatures and executives.
Structure
It has the largest membership of any representative body within the UK sector and is headquartered in Edinburgh.
Regions
Scotland - Madderty
Wales - Caernarfon
North England - Belford, Northumberland
East England - Weldon, Northamptonshire
Home Counties - Sandhurst
Marches - Newton Abbot
South West England - Kingsbridge
England - Newton Abbot
History
ConFor was created in 2004 and is the first organisation of its kind that has the entire supply chain within its membership, from nurseries and woodland owners, to processors and sawmills. This makes it different from other nations as the trade associations of the forest and wood-using industries are split within the different competing constituents of the supply chain. It is a membership organisation that is funded by and accountable to businesses within the industry.
Policy
The organisation lobbies governments, parliaments and assemblies of the United Kingdom, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland on behalf of members. As a member of the Confederation of European Forest Owners it also lobbies for its members at the European Parliament. Since devolution, rural policy making has been passed to the devolved administrations of the UK, meaning that strategy can vary over the different parts of the country. The devolved administrations of Scotland and Wales have produced their own forestry strategies: The Scottish Forestry Strategy and Woodlands for Wales which both view forestry as an integral part in the efforts to tackle climate change. In Scotland and Wales forestry policy resides within the Forestry Commission where, as, in England forestry policy resides in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) with the Forestry Commission England implementing policy.
Context
Forestry in the UK is split between the Forestry Commission, which is a government agency and the private sector. It breaks down between the private and public sector as:

Microsoft Windows profile refers to the user profile that is used by the Microsoft Windows operating system to represent the characteristics of the user.
Windows XP
Profile creation
Establishing a user account on the computer (or on its parent domain) does not create a profile for that user. The profile is created the first time the user interactively logs on at the computer. Logging on across a network to access shared folders does not create a profile.
At first logon, a folder will typically be created under "Documents and Settings" (standard folder on English version of Windows 2000, XP and Windows Server 2003) matching the logon name of the user. Should a folder of that name already exist, the profile-creation process will create a new one, typically named username.computername, on workgroup computers, or username.domainname on Active Directory member computers.
Once a profile folder has been created, Windows will never automatically rename that folder. Thus if the username itself is subsequently changed, the profile folder will remain as is, and the profile will no longer match the username, which could lead to confusion. For this reason, the administrator might want to avoid renaming user accounts if at all possible, or rename the folder manually and edit the registry to reflect the changes.
The new profile is created by making a copy of a special profile named Default User. It is permissible to modify this Default User profile (within certain guidelines) so as to provide a customized working environment for each new user. Modification of the Default User profile should ideally be done prior to any users logging-on to the computer. If a user has already logged on once or more, the Default Profile has no effect whatsoever for that user.
Profile contents
NTUSER.DAT Within the root of the profile, a file named NTUSER.DAT contains the user's personalized settings for the majority of software installed on the computer; including Windows itself. When the user logs on, NTUSER.DAT becomes merged with the computer's registry, such that it appears as the HKEY_CURRENT_USER branch of the registry tree. NTUSER.DAT is held open for writing (i.e., "locked") whenever the user is logged on.
My Documents This folder is intended to contain the user's work, and in Windows XP-aware programs, dialog boxes will typically prompt the user to store documents here. "My Documents" as a shortcut also appears on the desktop, and in My Computer. It is here that these shortcuts point.
Favorites, Cookies, and History These folders are used by Microsoft's Internet Explorer web browser to store surfing data. They are not used by alternative browsers such as Firefox or Opera, which typically store their data under "Application Data."
Nethood, Printhood These folders contain the network shares and printers discovered by the user with the Network Places applet, in the form of shortcuts.
Start Menu This folder contains the shortcuts present on the same-named Desktop feature.
Desktop This folder contains files and shortcuts present on the user's desktop.
Application Data Provided mainly for the use of programmers, as a place to store data that is related to specific software, but which does not fall into the category of documents that a user might open directly. This folder was made necessary by Windows' best practices programming guidelines, which now prohibit the storage of temporary data of any kind in the Program Files folder.
Local Settings Functionally similar to "Application Data", and contains a second subfolder of that name. It also contains the temporary files generated by Windows programs themselves, and as a result of Internet Explorer's online activities. For standalone computers the two folders are functionally similar, but on networks employing Roaming profiles, the "Local Settings" folder is not included in the profile synchronization process. Thus, data in the "Local Settings" folder will not be copied between computers when the user roams.
Note Some of these subfolders are hidden from the users view in Windows Explorer. To see them you must uncheck "Hide System Folders" in the folder options.
Special profiles
"Default User" - Plays a role in the profile-creation process, see above.
"All Users" - This profile is present mainly to answer an issue related to software installation. It provides a way for setup programs to create desktop or start-menu shortcuts which will be visible to all users of the computer, not just the user running the setup program. The Application Data section may also contain program-data common to all users. "All Users" acts purely as an information-store, it is never loaded as an active profile.
"Administrator" - All versions of NT-based Windows have an administrator account and corresponding profile, although on XP this account may only be visible on the logon screen if the computer is started in safe mode. In Windows Vista, it is disabled by default.
History and origin
Historically, the Windows 95-98 product line did not employ user-profiling as standard, with all users sharing the same settings, although that feature could be activated in Control Panel.
The user-profiling scheme in force today owes its origins to Windows NT, which stored its profiles within the system folder itself, typically under C:\WINNT\Profiles\. Windows 2000 saw the change to a separate "Documents and Settings" folder for profiles, and in this respect is virtually identical to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.
Recent developments
Windows Vista's profiles are functionally similar to those of Windows XP, but with some differences. Perhaps the key difference is that they are stored in a "C:\Users" folder, instead of "C:\Documents and Settings." Therefore, to cater for programs which are not Vista-ready, a symbolic link is also provided under the name of "Documents and Settings" which invisibly redirects any attempted access of the latter to "C:\Users." The fact that the profile root folder appears twice in any folder listing has adverse implications for any backup program. Backup software needs to be aware of this Vista idiosyncrasy, or else it is possible to double the size of the backup by copying what appear to be two separate folders, both potentially containing the bulk of the data on the computer.
A second change in Vista is that the media-specific "My Pictures" and "My Music" folders are now outside of the "My Documents" folder, instead of being subfolders (as well as removing the "My" Prefix - so My Documents becomes Documents, for example).

The Eparchy of Edmonton is a Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church ecclesiastical territory or eparchy of the Catholic Church that governs parishes in the Canadian province of Alberta. It uses the Byzantine Rite liturgy in the Ukrainian language and English language. The eparchy's cathedral is St. Josaphat's Cathedral in the episcopal see of Edmonton, Alberta.
History
On 19 January 1948, it was established as Ukrainian Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Western Canada (an Eastern Catholic missionary pre-diocesan jurisdiction, akin to a Latin apostolic prefecture), on territory split off from the then Ukrainian Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Canada.
On 10 March 1951, it was renamed as Ukrainian Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Edmonton, after its see.
On 3 November 1956, promoted as Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy (Eastern Catholic diocese) of Edmonton. It thus lost its exempt status, becoming a suffragan in the ecclesiastical province of the Metropolitan Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Winnipeg.
On 27 June 1974, it lost territory to establish the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of New Westminster.
On January 26, 2007 Pope Benedict XVI appointed former Auxiliary Bishop David Motiuk of the Archeparchy of Winnipeg as head of the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Edmonton.
Extent
As of 2020, the diocese contains 81 parishes, 35 active diocesan and religious priests and 25,000 Catholics. It also has 11 women religious, 4 religious brothers and 8 permanent deacons.

Eparchial Logo
The golden church dome under a blue sky was a symbol of faith and hope for the Ukrainian Greek Catholics who emigrated to the New World. Today, it remains a recognizable image that is familiar and welcoming to all Albertans, no matter their background.
In this representation, logo designer Julian Hayda modelled their dome after St. Mary Ukrainian Catholic Parish in Waugh, Alberta. They explain, “What you see here are two paths, beginning at both East and West, and converging at a pinnacle as two hands holding one cross together.”  They are referring to Eastern Catholics in full communion with Rome, joined in the one Catholic Church. The arms reaching upward also reflect our ardent desire to enter into communion with the awesomeness of God through the sacrificial love of Christ represented by the cross.
As in classical iconography, the colour blue also represents divinity. The darker the blue, the more deeply we enter into the life of the Holy Trinity. The circle stands for the eternal nature of God – without beginning or end. As such, God's love for us is eternal – a mystery beyond our understanding. In contrast, the golden dome reflects the glory of God, the Divine Light visible to us. Its shape reminds us of the vault of heaven where we experience the embrace of the living God, especially through the Holy Mysteries, the Eucharist in particular.
Finally, an invitation, “Come follow me.” Christ who called the first disciples, also calls each and every one of us to follow him. A relatable and inspiring image, the logo of the Eparchy of Edmonton reflects the mission of the Church, to evangelize and share the Good News of the Gospel of Jesus Christ with everyone, no matter where they are on their faith journey.

Veronica peregrina is a species of flowering plant in the plantain family known by several common names including neckweed, American speedwell, purslane speedwell and hairy purslane speedwell. It is native to the Americas, and is known on other continents as an introduced species and a common weed. It can be weedy in its native range as well, growing on roadsides, on fields, and in other disturbed habitat. It is an annual herb growing from a taproot. The two subspecies are defined generally on the basis of hairiness: ssp. xalapensis is coated in glandular hairs and ssp. peregrina is a hairless variety. The plant produces erect stems up to about 30 centimeters tall. The leaves vary in shape from linear to lance-shaped to spoon-shaped with smooth or serrated edges; the lower leaves are borne on petioles. The inflorescence is a loose terminal raceme of flowers and lance-shaped bracts. The flowers are generally white and 2 or 3 millimeters wide.

The Subaru R1 is a kei car manufactured by the Japanese carmaker Subaru from 2005 to 2010.
Design
Entering production on January 4, 2005, the R1 is a two-door version of the Subaru R2, but with a shorter body and wheelbase. The R1 is unusual in that it does not use up the maximum length allowed for by the kei car regulations—the only other kei cars to have done this since the 1989 Autozam Carol were the Suzuki Twin, Daihatsu Midget, Toyota C+pod, and the European Smart Fortwo.
The R1 was only available in one spec level up to the end of 2005, using a 658 cc Subaru EN engine. The engine is available in three versions: the with the EN07U SOHC engine, the R with the EN07D DOHC engine rated at 40 kW (54 horsepower) and the STi with an EN07X supercharged and intercooled engine rated at . The R1 is being marketed as a personal car and as a middle-aged couple's second car; a combination of leather and Alcantara seating is available. All R1s are equipped with a CVT, and all trim levels are available with front-wheel drive as well as four-wheel drive.
In its promotional materials, the R1 was frequently compared to the Subaru 360, the first production Subaru automobile.
Derivative vehicles
The R1 is the base car for the following vehicles:
The Subaru R1e, an experimental battery electric vehicle undergoing limited production for selected industrial clients in Japan. There was intense interest in this vehicle within the US EV community, as it uses lithium-ion batteries (which contribute to a significant improvement in range and can be 80% recharged in just 15 minutes).
The Prodrive P2 concept sports car.
Collectibles
Tomica manufactured a diecast 1/64 R1, and Takara made a Choro-Q plastic pull-back R1.

The Hyndburn Academy, previously known as Norden High School and Sports College, is the united learning academy school situated in the small town of Rishton, Lancashire, England.
History
The current headteacher is Nicola Palmer, who was appointed in April 2017.
The school had an inspection by Ofsted in March 2022 and officially received the Good rating two months following the inspection. The school was previously given an Inadequate rating in July 2016, the school became part of the United Learning trust of academies; and the school was subsequently rebranded as The Hyndburn Academy at the commencement of the autumn term of September 2017.
Description
The school provides secondary education for ~600 children aged 11 to 16 who live in the towns of Rishton, Great Harwood, Clayton-Le-Moors and Accrington. In the most recent GCSE results, the percentage of students who got Grade 5 or higher was 19%, and 39.7% of students got the Progress 8 benchmark respectively.
The school gained sports college status in July 2004, having initially launched its bid the previous November and reaching its fundraising target in February 2004. Norden High School and Sports College was closed on 31 October 2017, and Hyndburn Academy opened the following day.

Glue semantics, or simply Glue (Dalrymple et al. 1993; Dalrymple 1999, 2001), is a linguistic theory of semantic composition and the syntax–semantics interface which assumes that meaning composition is constrained by a set of instructions stated within a formal logic (linear logic). These instructions, called meaning constructors, state how the meanings of the parts of a sentence can be combined to provide the meaning of the sentence.
Overview
Glue was developed as a theory of the syntax–semantics interface within the linguistic theory of lexical functional grammar, and most work within Glue has been conducted within that framework. LFG/Glue assumes that the syntactic structure that is most relevant for meaning assembly is the functional structure, a structure which represents abstract syntactic predicate argument structure and relations like subject and object. In this setting, a meaning constructor for an intransitive verb states that the verb combines with the meaning of its subject to produce a meaning for the sentence. This is similar in some respects to the view of the syntax-semantics interface assumed within categorial grammar, except that abstract syntactic relations like subject and object rather than relations such as to-the-left-of are involved in meaningful constructor specifications. Glue analyses within other syntactic formalisms have also been proposed; besides LFG, glue analyses have been proposed within HPSG, context-free grammar, categorial grammar, and tree-adjoining grammar.
Glue is a theory of the syntax–semantics interface which is compatible not only with various syntactic frameworks, but also with different theories of semantics and meaning representation. Semantic formalisms that have been used as the meaning languages in glue semantics analyses include versions of discourse representation theory, intensional logic, first-order logic, and natural semantic metalanguage.

Fyodor Evtikhievich Zubov (1615 – November 3, 1689), was a Russian painter, engraver, miniaturist and illuminator.
Biography
Zubov was born in Solikamsk, a member of the noble Zubov family. They began working in Veliky Ustyug and Yaroslavl. In 1662 they moved to Moscow where they worked with Simon Ushakov. Their work included icons, illuminated manuscripts, drawings for engravings, and wall paintings. When Ushakov died in 1686, Zubov took over as the Director of the Imperial Workshop of Icon Painters in the Kremlin Armoury. They died in Moscow, in 1689.

The Lehrerleut, also Lehrerleit, are a branch of the Hutterites that emerged in 1877. They are the most traditional branch of the Hutterites.
History
Thirteen Hutterite families under the leadership of Jacob Wipf (1835–1896) emigrated from Johannesruh, Ukraine, to South Dakota in 1877, where they after their arrival formed the Lehrerleut by establishing a community of goods at Elmspring Colony near Parkston, South Dakota, thus following the example of the Schmiedeleut and the Dariusleut. The group's leader was a teacher (German: Lehrer), hence their name Lehrerleut ("teacher people").
Shortly after World War I, two Hutterite conscientious objectors from the Lehrerleut branch, Joseph and Michael Hofer, died in an American prison. This and growing anti-German sentiment caused the emigration of all four Lehrerleut colonies to Alberta, Canada, in the following years. In 1945, the Lehrerleut started to form new colonies in Montana, thus returning to the United States.
Demography
In 1957 there were 20 Lehrerleut colonies in Alberta, 3 in Saskatchewan and 8 in Montana. In 1973 the total number of Lehrerleut colonies was 61. According to the "2004 Hutterite Phone Book" there were 69 Schmiedeleut colonies in Alberta and 30 in Saskatchewan. An additional 44 colonies were in Montana, all together 143. Rod Janzen and Max Stanton report in their book of 2010 that there were 139 Lehrerleut colonies, 72 in Alberta, 32 Saskatchewan and 35 in Montana.

Racer-X is the third EP by American post-hardcore band Big Black. It was released by Homestead Records in 1984 and reissued by Touch and Go Records in 1992.
Racer-X was the first of Big Black's records to cement their instrumental lineup of two guitars, one bass guitar and a Roland TR-606 drum machine. It was the final album to feature the bass playing of Jeff Pezzati who left to dedicate more time on their primary band Naked Raygun.
Like Big Black's first 2 EPs, the original record contained just six songs (five by Big Black, one by James Brown) clocking in at under 20 minutes total.
Title
Racer X was a character on the seminal anime series Speed Racer. The EP's title track makes numerous references to the original TV show.
Single
The song "Il Duce" (about Benito Mussolini) was recorded in the same session as the songs from the Racer-X EP. The song was released the following year as a 7" single backed with "Big Money" from the Atomizer LP. Homestead records also issued a promotional 12" version of the single with "Il Duce" and "Big Money" on the A-side, plus three live tracks on the B-side.
Cover art
The original EP featured cover art by Nate Kaatrud (better known as National Kato/Nash Kato) from the band Urge Overkill. When Touch and Go reissued the EP in 1992, the original artwork could not be found and a new cover was produced.
Influence
The Japandroids covered "Racer-X" during their Dec 15, 2009 Daytrotter session. Of “Racer X” they say this:
We're recording a 7-inch in January and this going to be the B-side. This song was originally done by Big Black and came out on the Racer-X EP in 1984. Our version is pretty good, but the original is a masterpiece.

In graph theory, an ear of an undirected graph G is a path P where the two endpoints of the path may coincide, but where otherwise no repetition of edges or vertices is allowed, so every internal vertex of P has degree two in G. An ear decomposition of an undirected graph G is a partition of its set of edges into a sequence of ears, such that the one or two endpoints of each ear belong to earlier ears in the sequence and such that the internal vertices of each ear do not belong to any earlier ear. Additionally, in most cases the first ear in the sequence must be a cycle. An open ear decomposition or a proper ear decomposition is an ear decomposition in which the two endpoints of each ear after the first are distinct from each other.
Ear decompositions may be used to characterize several important graph classes, and as part of efficient graph algorithms. They may also be generalized from graphs to matroids.
Characterizing graph classes
Several important classes of graphs may be characterized as the graphs having certain types of ear decompositions.
Graph connectivity
A graph is k-vertex-connected if the removal of any (k − 1) vertices leaves a connected subgraph, and k-edge-connected if the removal of any (k − 1) edges leaves a connected subgraph.
The following result is due to :
A graph with is 2-vertex-connected if and only if it has an open ear decomposition.
The following result is due to :
A graph is 2-edge-connected if and only if it has an ear decomposition.
In both cases the number of ears is necessarily equal to the circuit rank of the given graph. Robbins introduced the ear decomposition of 2-edge-connected graphs as a tool for proving the Robbins theorem, that these are exactly the graphs that may be given a strongly connected orientation. Because of the pioneering work of Whitney and Robbins on ear decompositions, an ear decomposition is sometimes also called a Whitney–Robbins synthesis .
A non-separating ear decomposition is an open ear decomposition such that, for each vertex v with only one exception, v has a neighbor whose first appearance in the decomposition is in a later ear than the first appearance of v. This type of ear decomposition may be used to generalize Whitney's result:
A graph with is 3-vertex-connected if and only if G has a non-separating ear decomposition.
If such a decomposition exists, it can be chosen with respect to a particular edge uv of G in such a way that u is in the first ear, v is the new vertex in the last ear with more than one edge, and uv is a single-edge ear.
This result was first stated explicitly by , but as describes, it is equivalent to a result in the 1971 Ph.D. thesis of Lee Mondshein. Structures closely related to non-separating ear decompositions of maximal planar graphs, called canonical orderings, are also a standard tool in graph drawing.
Strong connectivity of directed graphs
The above definitions can also be applied to directed graphs. An ear would then be a directed path where all internal vertices have indegree and outdegree equal to 1. A directed graph is strongly connected if it contains a directed path from every vertex to every other vertex. Then we have the following theorem :
A directed graph is strongly connected if and only if it has an ear decomposition.
Factor-critical graphs
An ear decomposition is odd if each of its ears uses an odd number of edges. A factor-critical graph is a graph with an odd number of vertices, such that for each vertex v, if v is removed from the graph then the remaining vertices have a perfect matching. found that:
A graph G is factor-critical if and only if G has an odd ear decomposition.
More generally, a result of makes it possible to find in any graph G the ear decomposition with the fewest even ears.
Series–parallel graphs
A tree ear decomposition is a proper ear decomposition in which the first ear is a single edge and for each subsequent ear , there is a single ear , , such that both endpoints of lie on . A nested ear decomposition is a tree ear decomposition such that, within each ear , the set of pairs of endpoints of other ears that lie within form a set of nested intervals. A series–parallel graph is a graph with two designated terminals s and t that can be formed recursively by combining smaller series–parallel graphs in one of two ways: series composition (identifying one terminal from one smaller graph with one terminal from the other smaller graph, and keeping the other two terminals as the terminals of the combined graph) and parallel composition (identifying both pairs of terminals from the two smaller graphs).
The following result is due to :
A 2-vertex-connected graph is series–parallel if and only if it has a nested ear decomposition.
Moreover, any open ear decomposition of a 2-vertex-connected series–parallel graph must be nested. The result may be extended to series–parallel graphs that are not 2-vertex-connected by using open ear decompositions that start with a path between the two terminals.
Matroids
The concept of an ear decomposition can be extended from graphs to matroids. An ear decomposition of a matroid is defined to be a sequence of circuits of the matroid, with two properties:
each circuit in the sequence has a nonempty intersection with the previous circuits, and
each circuit in the sequence remains a circuit even if all previous circuits in the sequence are contracted.
When applied to the graphic matroid of a graph G, this definition of an ear decomposition coincides with the definition of a proper ear decomposition of G: improper decompositions are excluded by the requirement that each circuit include at least one edge that also belongs to previous circuits. Using this definition, a matroid may be defined as factor-critical when it has an ear decomposition in which each circuit in the sequence has an odd number of new elements .
Algorithms
On classical computers, ear decompositions of 2-edge-connected graphs and open ear decompositions of 2-vertex-connected graphs may be found by greedy algorithms that find each ear one at a time. A simple greedy approach that computes at the same time ear decompositions, open ear decompositions, st-numberings and -orientations in linear time (if exist) is given in . The approach is based on computing a special ear decomposition named chain decomposition by one path-generating rule. shows that non-separating ear decompositions may also be constructed in linear time.
, , and provided efficient parallel algorithms for constructing ear decompositions of various types. For instance, to find an ear decomposition of a 2-edge-connected graph, the algorithm of proceeds according to the following steps:
Find a spanning tree of the given graph and choose a root for the tree.
Determine, for each edge uv that is not part of the tree, the distance between the root and the lowest common ancestor of u and v.
For each edge uv that is part of the tree, find the corresponding "master edge", a non-tree edge wx such that the cycle formed by adding wx to the tree passes through uv and such that, among such edges, w and x have the lowest common ancestor that is as close to the root as possible (with ties broken by edge identifiers).
Form an ear for each non-tree edge, consisting of it and the tree edges for which it is the master, and order the ears by their master edges' distance from the root (with the same tie-breaking rule).
These algorithms may be used as subroutines for other problems including testing connectivity, recognizing series–parallel graphs, and constructing st-numberings of graphs (an important subroutine in planarity testing).
An ear decomposition of a given matroid, with the additional constraint that every ear contains the same fixed element of the matroid, may be found in polynomial time given access to an independence oracle for the matroid .

George Barry Mallon (May 20, 1865 – January 13, 1928) was an editor for The Sun (New York) from Malone, New York. They were active in New York City literary circles for forty years as both a writer and an editor.
Early life
Mallon was the son of M.S. and Martha Elizabeth Barry Mallon. They graduated from Amherst College in 1887 and studied at Franklin Academy prior to this.
Career as a journalist
They came to New York City in the fall of 1887, working as a reporter for the Commercial Advertiser. In 1888 Mallon joined The Sun, being promoted to assistant city editor in 1895 and city editor in 1903. They continued in this position for a decade, training a number of young newspaper writers. They resigned from The Sun in 1912 and took a job with the Butterick Publishing Company. On the occasion of theirs leaving the newspaper, The Sun Alumni Association gave a luncheon in their honor at the Hotel Brevoort. Charles S. Whitman, district attorney of New York and later the state's governor, was among those in attendance.
When the United States entered World War I Mallon started a weekly newspaper in New Jersey called War Thrift. They employed it effectively as a tool for raising thrift stamps. During their association with Bankers Trust Company they presided over their publication which
pertained to economic and financial subjects. It concentrated particularly on the financial situations of England, France, and Canada.
Mallon was a popular after dinner speaker when they were president of the Dutch Treat Club and as an associate of the Amherst Alumni Association.
Private life
They married Irene Stuyvesant Black in 1895. They were the daughter of William T. Black, a former city surveyor of New York and treasurer of the
Republican Club. Them grandfather was Job Lippincott Black, superintendent of public works in New York in 1848. Irene died in 1923.
Mallon's death was attributed to leucocythemia. They died in Baltimore, Maryland at Howard Kelly Hospital.

Snow Point was a historic mining town in Nevada County, California on the San Juan Ridge about 2 miles east of Moore's Flat and about 6 miles west of Graniteville. It was located at an elevation of 4321 ft just off present day German Bar Road about midway between that road's intersections with present day Moore's Flat Road and Hagerty Road.
Early history
Snow Point was founded in 1853. It owes its existence to its location at the point where the fabled Blue Lead bed of gold-bearing gravel crosses the Middle Yuba River from Sierra County and then heads in a south westerly direction down the San Juan Ridge to French Corral. It was "believed to be the most extensive and richest deposit of auriferous gravel in the United States, if not in the world."
Reports of mining at Snow Point begin in 1853. That year, Edwin McCabe, who later claimed to be the first white child born in Nevada County, was born in Snow Point. An electoral district was created there for the 1853 gubernatorial election. In 1855, the town was described as follows:
"Snow Point was never more lively than at present. New buildings are constantly going up, among which is one newly completed by our old friend J. M. Hunter, Esq., which is intended for a billiard saloon and would do credit even to Nevada, with all their improvements. There are also two stores, well filled; two hotels, with agreeable landlords and ladies and a fine bakery under way, in connection with H. Devendorff & Co.'s store."
Its heyday was in the 1850s. In addition to the businesses mentioned above, it had two sawmills. Its social life included balls, foot races and visiting minstrel shows. It was connected by stage to Nevada City, Downieville and Eureka (later Graniteville). In the 1860s, the newspaper reports about the town peter out. By then, Moore's Flat had become the commercial and social center of that part of the Ridge. Snow Point never had a post office or a school, but Moore's Flat did. But mining continued to prosper. In 1882, one paper commented: "Moore's Flat would be a "dead town" were it not for the Snow Point mine."
Mining
Mining was king in Snow Point. In 1858, it declared itself to be the hub of Phoenix Hill Mining District and promulgated a set of mining laws. Because of its location on the Blue Lead, all types of mining flourished. There were regular reports of large gold nuggets. There were a number of successful hydraulic gravel mines, such as Blackwell & Co and the Conger Bros. Hydraulic mining required lots of water. Initially water was scarce and seasonal, but that changed with the arrival of ditches, especially the Miners' Ditch in late 1855, later incorporated into the Eureka Lake Company's system of ditches.
There was successful hard rock or quartz mining, though quartz mining was initially hampered by a lack of local mills to crush the ore. In one day in 1855, 4 members of Walton & Co, took out $10,000 in "clean gold" from a quartz vein. From the famous Fellows quartz strike, $108,000 in gold was taken. And there was drift mining, especially where water was not conveniently available.
Contemporary reports all commented on the richness of the Snow Point mines. Around Snow Point, "the old river bed is rich in gold and has been, so far, comparatively untouched." Another observed that around Snow Point is "the richest field of gravel in the world."
After the 1884 Sawyer decision restricted much hydraulic mining, drift and quartz mining became even more important. One observer predicted in 1885, "that Moore's Flat and Snow Point will before long become important quartz mining camps."
In the 20th century
While the town seems to have withered away, mining continued well into the 20th century. The principal mines were the Snow Point mine and the Twin Sisters mine, both managed by George Hegarty, initially on behalf of Hearst family interests and later on behalf of other investors from the San Francisco Bay Area. There was a mining revival around 1950, but references to mining at Snow Point disappear after that. There is some scattered mining that continues. Presently there is no readily visible evidence of the town or its mines, except for some scarred land.

They were the Cabinet Minister of the Water Resources Department in Uddhav Thackeray ministry. Previously they have been the Rural Development Minister (2009 to 2014), the Finance Minister (1999 to 2008) and the Home Minister (2008 to 2009) of Maharashtra.
Early life and education
Jayant Patil is the younger son of former Maharashtra Cabinet Minister and celebrated veteran Congress leader, Rajarambapu Patil. They were named ‘jayant' meaning victorious, since they were born shortly after their father's first electoral victory in the 1962 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election. Jayantrao completed their Bachelors in Civil Engineering from the Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute and subsequently left to pursue their Masters' Degree from the New Jersey Institute of Technology, USA. Unfortunately, after the sudden death of Rajarambapu Patil in 1984, Jayant Patil had to return from the USA. After returning to their home town they preferred not to contest any parliamentary election and became involved in social work through their father's cooperative organisations. With the determination and persistence of the people, they were unanimously elected the President of the Kasegaon Education Society and the Chairman of the Walwa Sugar Cooperation in the same year.
After working around six years in the overall development of the Sangli area, Patil was given a ticket to contest the State Legislative Assembly elections from Walwa at the age of 28.
Entry into politics
Patil contested the 1990 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election on an Indian National Congress ticket from Walwa in the Sangli District. Since then, they have represented Islampur-Walwa constituency 7 times, i.e. 30 years with an average margin of 62,000.
Between 1995 and 1999, when the first Sena-BJP Government was in power in the State, Jayant Patil was a part of the famous ‘Patil Troika' which kept the saffron Government on its toes in the Assembly. Among the two other Patils were the former Deputy Chief Minister, R. R. Patil and former Assembly speaker Dilip Walse-Patil. After their split from Congress in 1999, the Patil Troika decided to throw their weight behind Sharad Pawar.
Formation of Nationalist Congress Party
In 1999, after the 12th Lok Sabha was dissolved and elections to the 13th Lok Sabha were called, Sharad Pawar, P. A. Sangma, and Tariq Anwar demanded that the party needed to propose someone native-born as the prime ministerial candidate and not the Italian-born Sonia Gandhi, who had entered party politics and replaced Sitaram Kesri as Congress president. In response, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) expelled the trio for six years from the party.
In response Pawar and Sangma founded the Nationalist Congress Party in June 1999. Despite the falling out, the new party aligned with the Congress party to form a coalition government in Maharashtra after the 1999 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election to prevent the Shiv Sena-BJP combine from returning to power. Sharad Pawar, however, did not return to state politics and Vilasrao Deshmukh of Congress was chosen as Chief Minister, with Chagan Bhujbal representing the NCP as the Deputy Chief Minister along with Home Affairs and Jayant Patil as the Finance Minister.
In Government
Jayant Patil became the youngest Finance Minister of Maharashtra, presenting their first budget at the age of 39. They went on to present the Maharashtra Budget 10 times consecutively, a record till date, and brought many major changes to the State.  They are often credited with reviving the state economy from a low point in 2003-2004. At the time, the State's financial condition was in a precarious condition due to overspending by the previous Government in ambitious projects like the Mumbai–Pune Expressway, Krishna Valley Irrigation Project, etc. Additionally, the implementation of the 5th Pay Commission had also put a considerable strain on the State's financial resources. In 2001, Jayant Patil met with a severe accident near Bangalore and had to undergo multiple operations on their fractured legs and was confined to a wheelchair for several months. They presented the finance budget of 2001 while they were still on the wheelchair.
In their 10-year stint as the finance Minister from 1999-2008, Patil took firm steps to strengthen the State's finances like delinking dearness allowance paid to the State Government from the Central Government, appointing a committee of secretaries to probe the issues of excess State Government staff and acting and abolishing many posts in the State Government. They also tried to delay the implementation of the 6th Pay Commission as much as possible. Taking advantage of falling interest rates, Jayant Patil also raised fresh loans to retire high cost debts. All these measures reduced the State Government's expenditure on items like salary, pension and interest from 75 percent of the total expenditure to around 60 percent.
In the aftermath of the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, R. R. Patil resigned as the Home Minister. After NCP accepted the resignation, Patil was sworn in as Home Minister of Maharashtra in the First Ashok Chavan ministry. For the next one year as the Home Minister of Maharashtra, Patil played a highly crucial role in modernizing the Maharashtra Police, in terms of equipment and training. They established the Force 1, which is an elite counter-terrorism unit of the Mumbai Police with highly upgraded modern weapons. Formed on the lines of the National Security Guards (NSG), its initial training was with the Israeli Special forces and is mainly responsible to guard the Mumbai Metropolitan Area. During this tenure as Home Minister, Patil also passed proposals to install almost 5000 CCTVs in across Mumbai.
In 2009, Jayant Patil was sworn in as the Rural Development Minister in the Second Ashok Chavan ministry and continued with the same in the Prithviraj Chavan ministry. Their tenure as the Rural Development Minister till 2014 saw some pioneering works including the implementation of E-Panchayats, the improvement of e-banking services in rural Maharashtra and development of sustainable eco-villages. The Eco-Villages Scheme was a grand plan in line to combat climate change and to improve the development and preservation of villages in Maharashtra. The programme involved uplifting the environmental standard of villages and plan their infrastructural development to avoid haphazard constructions. Villages qualified for the scheme received a lump sum fund every year to be used in various development capacities. Jayant Patil toured Maharashtra for the outreach of the scheme and conducted 120 meetings with villagers across Maharashtra. This scheme significantly improved the tax collection from villages across the State and championed the plantation of over 1 crore trees.
Present Political Career
In the 2014 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election, NCP was reduced to just 41 seats, their biggest defeat till date and was in the Opposition benches almost after a decade. Jayant Patil retained their constituency and soon became NCP's leading speaker in the Assembly, regularly opening debates and keeping a strong tone on the Government. In 2018 they were unanimously elected as the State President of NCP replacing Sunil Tatkare. Patil had the uphill battle of reorganizing and delivering a better result in the 2019 Assembly Elections. Going into the elections, the NCP and INC alliance was not touted to do well, and the entire burden of campaigning and outreach fell on NCP solely. In August 2019, Jayant Patil launched and spearheaded the Shiv Swarajya Yatra from Shivneri, the birthplace of Chharapati Shivaji, at Junnar, Pune. In the 2019 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election, BJP won 105 seats, SHS won 56, NCP won 54 seats and INC won 42 seats. A political crisis ensued in the post-poll period. With no political party able to prove their majority in the legislative assembly, president's rule was imposed in the state following a recommendation by the Governor of Maharashtra Bhagat Singh Koshyari. The President's rule was later revoked and the Bharatiya Janata Party, led by former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, formed a government with the help of a small fraction of the Nationalist Congress Party, led by Ajit Pawar. After three days, Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar resigned. A new government was formed by the Maha Vikas Aghadi, a new alliance of Shiv Sena, the Indian National Congress, and the Nationalist Congress Party with Uddhav Thackeray as the Chief Minister. Jayant Patil was one of the was among the first 6 to be sworn-in in the MVA Government. They became a Cabinet Minister for the 4th time with the portfolio of Water Resources & Command Area Development.
Additionally, they were elected as the leader of the NCP Legislative Party in the Vidhan Sabha in place of Ajit Pawar on 24 November 2019.  They are also the Guardian Minister of Sangli.
In June 2020, in celebration of 21 years of NCP, Jayant Patil under the guidance of Sharad Pawar, launched the Rashtravadi Paksh Abhipray, an internal party digital feedback campaign. It was a flagship campaign where the party digitally reached out to almost 10 lac NCP members to amass their feedback and suggestions.
Philanthropic Work and Development of Sangli
Rajarambapu Patil was a noted educationist and philanthropist in their own right and started the Kasegaon Education Society. From as early as 1955, they implemented numerous social development initiatives such as buildings for schools, drinking water wells, homes for poor, banking services, jobs for youth, etc. which had direct benefits for the masses of the area. Following in their father's footsteps, Jayant Patil's involvement with socio-development works in the Sangli area started before their political career.
 They are credited for bringing piped drinking and farm water to the Walva Taluka from 15 kilometers away before which the area was limited to traditional means. In 2006, on their birthday, Jayant Poverty Eradication Campaign was started to uplift about 12,000 BPL families from the Walwa region. Till date the campaign has benefited more than 50,000 individuals with a total amount of 48 crores. The organization aides in health services, education, housing, employment, financial assistance, rehabilitation, youth guidance, accessing Government schemes, etc.
Like other NCP leaders in Maharashtra they have various education institutes and cooperative bodies under their patronage, many of which were established by their father. All of these organizations work for the upliftment of the lives of the people around them. Some of them include: 1. Rajarambapu Institute of Technology (RIT); 2. Cooperative Milk Federation popularly known as Krishna Dudh; 3.Sugar Factories; 4.Rajarambapu Textile Park; 5.Rajarambapu Sahakari Bank Limited(Scheduled Bank) 6.Kasegaon Education Society 7. Food Processing Units.
Personal Life
Jayant Patil is married to Shailaja Patil who is involved with social and relief works in the Sangli region. They have two sons, Prateek Patil and Rajvardhan Patil. They live in Mumbai and Uran Islampur.

Manchester was a small unincorporated community in Kingsbury County in the east-central part of the U.S. state of South Dakota. On June 24, 2003, the town was annihilated by a large F4-rated tornado, and has since become a ghost town. In 2004, the state of South Dakota officially disincorporated the town of Manchester.
History
Manchester was originally called Fairview; the present name honors a certain pioneer settler named Manchester. With the influence of the railroad, Manchester underwent rapid expansion, including the building of "numerous homes, a town hall, grocery stores, livery barns, a lumberyard, two grain elevators, a depot, a restaurant, a cream station, a bank, a pool hall, auto repair, blacksmith shops, gas stations, two churches, a system of township schools including Manchester High School, a hotel, a newspaper and a fabled town pump".
Grace Ingalls Dow, sister of Little House on the Prairie author Laura Ingalls Wilder, spent a significant part of their adult life in Manchester. They worked as a teacher in the local school and died in 1941. Them sister Mary Ingalls lived with them for a while as well. Laura Ingalls Wilder spent many years (and set several of their Little House books) in De Smet, a similarly sized town seven miles to Manchester's east along the railroad line.
Into the 20th century, the diminishing importance of the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad line through Manchester slowed train traffic and cut into the town's expansion, causing many to leave the town. This slide continued into the Great Depression as the line lay idle and more residents were forced to close their businesses and move elsewhere to find work. Despite road contact finally being made through Manchester in the late 1930s, little remained to induce people to linger and the few remaining residents began to die off or move away, with many relocating to nearby De Smet or Huron. Having lost many of its residents and its primary means of attracting more, Manchester's population steadily dwindled until a core population of no more than 100 residents remained, with most operating farms and ranches outside the town limits. The CNW railroad officially announced its intended permanent abandonment of the railroad line in 1986, but later sold the tracks to the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad. By 2003, less than a dozen structures (including two operating businesses) remained standing on the original Manchester town plot along US-14 and 425th Avenue.
Destruction by The Manchester, SD F4 Tornado
On June 24, 2003 a classic supercell thunderstorm spawned a tornado over eastern South Dakota. The tornado gradually matured and widened, forming a large "wedge" shape, and achieving an intensity of F4 on the Fujita scale and a width of between one-half and one mile as it entered Manchester.
The mesocyclone associated with the tornado was tracked by a large number of meteorologists and storm chasers. A small probe was placed directly in the tornado's damage path. The vortex traveled directly over the instrument, and record-breaking meteorological data was obtained by the probe. It managed to survive winds at the time estimated to be up to 260 mph (418 km/h) and measured a barometric pressure fall of around 100 millibars near the center of the half-mile wide tornado. Current estimates of wind speeds in an EF4-rated tornado would be in the 166-200 mph (267–322 km/h) range.
Manchester was an extremely small and compact town, with the central township abutting the intersection of US Highway 14 and 425th Avenue in rural Kingsbury County and surrounded on all sides by miles of farmland. The tornado struck the town from the south while doing strong F3/weak F4 damage, and was easily powerful enough to destroy the handful of elderly structures remaining in the town center (including the town post office), as well as several outlying buildings along US-14. According to Dan Kight of the Kingsbury County Sheriff's department: "There's a business that's partially left, but everything else is gone," noting only three or four families lived in Manchester. Also according to Kight, some residents were transported to the hospital with injuries.
Storm chaser Tim Samaras placed several "turtle probes" ahead of the tornado's path and one of them scored a direct hit. It recorded a pressure drop of 100 millibars in the span of five seconds, the deepest and fastest pressure drop ever recorded directly by any instrument in a weather event. The gravel was scoured from the road that the probe was placed in by the tornadic winds but when the probe was lifted there was still gravel underneath it.

Allen Edward Everitt (1824 – 11 June 1882) was an English architectural artist and illustrator. They were a leading artist in the Birmingham area between 1850 and 1880, and their work is a valuable historical record of local buildings of that period.
Life and work
Everitt was born in Birmingham, the son of Edward Everitt, an art dealer, and grandson of Allen Everitt, a well-known local artist and art teacher. Their maternal grandfather was David Parkes, the Shropshire antiquarian. They showed an early talent for art and received lessons from David Cox, with whom they remained a friend. Their specialty was drawing old buildings and their interiors. Taking Birmingham as a centre they made careful drawings of almost every spot in the Midlands of archaeological or historical interest. Between the ages of thirty and forty, they made painting tours of Belgium, France and Germany. After this, they devoted themselves particularly to building interiors, their work being mainly carried out in watercolour.
In 1857, Everitt joined the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists, becoming, in 1858, honorary secretary, a post they held until their death. They taught drawing for many years at the Deaf and Dumb Institution in Church Road, Edgbaston, of which they were also, virtually, the secretary. In 1870, the archaeological section of the Midlands Institute was formed, and Everitt was appointed one of its honorary secretaries. They contributed to its journal, "Transactions", with articles on "Aston Church", "Handsworth Church and its surroundings", "Archaeological researches ten miles around Birmingham", "Northfield Church", "Hampton-in-Arden", "Old houses in the Midlands" etc. They were also, for a time, a member of the general council of the Institute. In June 1880, they were appointed honorary curator of the municipal "Birmingham Free Art Gallery", the forerunner of the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.
In 1854, Everitt completed a series of drawings of Aston Hall, in Warwickshire, which were used to illustrate Alfred Davidson's History of the Holtes of Aston, Baronets, with a description of the family mansion (see bibliography). They also illustrated John Thackray Bunce's History of old St. Martin's (1875), the parish church of Birmingham.
In 1880, Everitt married Frances Hudson. They died on 11 June 1882, at Edgbaston, where they had lived most of their life, of "congestion of the lungs". Their very large collection of sketches has proved to be an invaluable historical record of buildings in the Birmingham area, many of which no longer exists.

Lim Lean Teng () was a successful business person who established schools in Penang with their wealth. They were born in 1870 in China. They first migrated to Penang, then to British Malaya.
Career
Lim Lean Teng ventured into business in Penang. They were successful and became a millionaire. They were one of the richest people in Penang at that time. They owned a bungalow as a personal residence. They also owned several other properties around the island. They helped establish the Han Chiang School with the Teochew Association of Penang. In 1919, the Teochew Association tried to establish SJK(C) Han Chiang but was short of funds. Lim Lean Teng came forward and donated the needed funds. The school was established on Chulia Street in Penang.
In 1950, Mr. Lim also established Han Chiang High School. This school was also on Chulia Street. However, by the time Han Chiang High School was founded, the school was overcrowded. Lim Lean Teng donated a piece of property piece to construct a new school. They gave of land in Jalan Datuk Keramat, George Town for the school's construction purposes. Lim Lean Teng continued to support the two Han Chiang schools.
In 1963, Lim Lean Teng died at age 93. Han Chiang School mourned the loss of their founder. Many people paid their respects and remembered their philanthropy for Chinese education in Malaysia.
Recognitions and honours
In 1958, Lim Lean Teng was honoured with a bronze statue established in front of Han Chiang High School. It was unveiled by the 1st Prime Minister of the then Federation of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman. After their death, Jalan Lim Lean Teng (aka Lim Lean Teng Road) was dedicated in memory of their works. The named road is the location of the Han Chiang High School.

Chaetomium perlucidum is a neurotropic dematiaceous (melanated cell wall) fungus that is naturally found in the soil, including in agricultural soil, and in the stems of dead plants. The fungus can also be found on the feathers of birds, manure, seeds, and even paper. It is able to thrive at temperatures of .
The fungus is an invasive opportunist to humans that can cause diseases such as onychomycosis (fungus on nails), otolaryngologic (head and neck) or respiratory inflammations (like sinusitis, pneumonia, and empyema), and brain necrosis.
History
It was first formally recorded in 1956 in Ukraine by K. S. Sergeeva.
Morphology
Chaetomium perlucidum is pigmented and dark in colour, appearing hairy and wooly, with a growth rate of 4-5 mm/day.
Perithecia (fruiting body)
Chaetomium perlucidum's fruiting bodies become fully mature in 13-16 days. The fruiting body's structural width is 90-200 μm, with an ostiolar pore (open pore) width of 30-50 μm.
Setae (bristle / "hair" structures)
Setae width is 2-3 μm and can have lengths of up to 700 μm. The setae are unbranched and appear to undulate.
Mature ascospores
Fully mature ascospores are 12.5-14 μm x 6-7.5 μm in size. They are smooth, oval-shaped, and brown in colour.
Lipid / fatty acid composition
Chaetomium perlucidum is composed of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids.
Pathogenicity
The fungus can cause chronic fungal infections in humans. An infection can spread throughout the body from a single point of infection into various other systems, e.g., the central nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory, and immune systems, with especially a low prognosis for cerebral infections.
Mode of transmission and infection
Infections take hold in the brain and progress to spread throughout the body. Pathways of entry into the host's body include via cutaneous lesions, oral intake, or intravenously.
Susceptibility
There have been at least two reported cases of cerebral phaeohyphomycosis in humans with one case resulting in death, reported in 2003. Both cases occurred in immunosuppressed individuals already suffering from complications of other unrelated diseases. Recreational drug users, or patients who have undergone intravenous or transplant procedures at even hospitals are also susceptible to being infected by C. perlucidum.
Treatment and prognosis
Most Chaetomium fungal diseases are without known cure and in one case of death from 1996, antifungal therapy through administering Amphotericin B (AMB) proved ineffective. AMB is a common and leading antibiotic treatment prescribed for fungal infections. In one case, C. perlucidum infection in the brain caused death from hemorrhaging throughout the body (especially in the brain) and complications that arose from acute inflammation. However, the physical removal of a C. perlucidum growth through a lobectomy (surgically removing the fungal growth from an area of affected organ/s) was successful in curing another patient from infection.
Culturing techniques
Chaetomium perlucidum ascospores can be cultured and grown in the lab through incubation on potato flake agar at 25° C for 6-10 days. Optimal growth temperature however is at 37° C. Mature perithecia can be obtained if the fungus has access to a sterile plant source.
Occurrence in farming soil
Chaetomium perlucidum was found more frequently in tilled than in untilled farmland.

The David Owsley Museum of Art (DOMA) is a university art museum located in the Fine Arts building on the campus of Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana, the United States of America. The museum's name was changed on October 6, 2011, from the Ball State Museum of Art to the David Owsley Museum of Art in honor of David T. Owsley, grandson of Frank C. Ball (one of the five Ball Brothers), to recognize their donation of over 2,300 works of art and planned gift of $5 million.
Since departments within the Fine Arts Building relocated to other areas on Ball State's campus, the museum has expanded its galleries, beginning in early-mid-2012 and ending in 2013.
The museum is home to approximately 11,000 works of art (mostly paintings, photographs, prints and sculptures). It is one of only four Indiana art museums with an encyclopedic, world art collection.
History
In 1892, a group of women formed the Art Students' League, hoping to raise interest in art in the growing community of Muncie. The Art Students' League held many successful art exhibits and then formed the Muncie Art Association in 1905, which in turn set goals to host an annual art show and to annually purchase a work of art to help establish a permanent collection. The permanent collection of the Muncie Art Association were located in the hallways of many Muncie schools until the founding of the Indiana State Normal School by the Ball Brothers. The works of art owned by the art association were then moved to the Indiana State Normal School. It was not until 1931 that plans were made to erect a building to permanently house the works of art. Opening in 1936, Architect George F. Schreiber built the Collegiate Gothic style museum, costing $420,000.
Fine Arts Building and Museum of Art
Just before the Great Depression, there was a need for an Art Center for an ever growing demand for art and music classrooms and space for an art gallery on campus. Architect George F. Schreiber was hired to design the collegiate gothic style building, but was put on hold because the state of Indiana issued a state moratorium on spending in 1932. It was not until 1935 that enough money was raised to begin construction on the building. In 1936, the Fine Arts Building and Museum of Art was opened under President L.A. Pittenger.
The Fine Arts Building also housed the foreign language, English and social science departments, and a Renaissance style auditorium or recital hall.
Current and Former Directors of the Museum
The Past
Francis F. Brown was the first supervisor of the gallery. After them came Alice Nichols who was director from 1949 till 1972 when they retired. William Story replaced Nichols and held the job from 1972 till 1983. After them came Alain Joyaux and Peter Blume respectively.
The Present
After Peter Blume, Robert G. La France was hired in 2014 and is the current director of the David Owsley Museum of Art.
Fine Arts Terrace
Undergraduate commencement ceremonies for the university are hosted annually in May on the Fine Arts Terrace, a grassy area in the center of the Quad, between the David Owsley Museum of Art and the statue of Beneficence by Daniel Chester French.
Events
The museum hosts multiple events throughout the year. Some events are reoccurring, such as Meditation in the Museum and Sketching in the Museum, which take place during the academic year (August to May) every Friday afternoon. Others are scheduled over the course of the year, and times and dates can be found on the David Owsley Museum of Art website.

"Renaissance" is a song by British electronic group M People. It was released on 28 February 1994 as the fourth and final single from their second album, Elegant Slumming. In Australia, it was released as the third single from the album. It was written by Mike Pickering and Paul Heard and produced by M People. The song peaked at number five on the UK Singles Chart following the band's first win for Best British Dance Act at the 1994 BRIT Awards.
Background
At the time of "Renaissance"'s release, M People were touring the second leg of their 15-date Elegant Slumming UK Tour and riding the height of their musical fortunes with their double platinum album. "How Can I Love You More (Mixes)", "One Night in Heaven", "Moving on Up" and "Don't Look Any Further" had already provided them with four consecutive singles and this became their fifth.
Composition
The song features pounding italo-piano chords and is laden with synths alongside an insistent bassline and classic house beat. Lyrically, it is in total contrast to the angry "breaking free" sung in "Moving on Up" to looking forward to coming home to one glorious night when singer Heather Small promises to "make you scream aloud with joy" – but "there'll be no day there'll be no night".
Critical reception
Irish newspaper Evening Herald noted "the thudding pulse" of the song. Kingston Informer deemed it "a happening tune from a band who can do no wrong at the moment." Howard Cohen from The Miami Herald complimented its "steady drum kick, pumping bass and trance-like beat". A reviewer from Music & Media wrote that "the pineapple-shaped hairdo of Heather Small is the eyecatcher in the videos, and their massive voice the focal point for the ears, enjoying a renaissance of '70s disco." Andy Beevers from Music Week said "it looks certain to be another big hit", adding that "this piano-powered track, with its catchy "I'm coming home" hook, will be instantly familiar to many as the theme for the student documentary, The Living Soap."
Chart performance
Out of the nine M People previous single releases at that point, this single was only the second to chart and peak in its first week (the only other single to do so at that point was predecessor "Don't Look Any Further"). "Renaissance" entered the chart and peaked in its first week at number five with sales of 89,000 copies in its first week, but made a steady descent out of the chart within seven weeks. When "Renaissance" left the chart, it had sold in total 179,000 copies. In the two weeks prior to "Renaissance"'s release, Elegant Slumming climbed back into the Top Ten at eight climbing to six once the song had been released, then rising further once again to peak at number four weeks later. For the second time, M People recorded simultaneous single and album Top 10s for two weeks, being at numbers five and six respectively and at six and five respectively the week after in March 1994. "Renaissance" was also used as the theme tune to the BBC2 show "The Living Soap" which helped the single sales.
Music video
The accompanying music video was filmed in San Francisco in January 1994 while the band promoted the launch of the US version of the album on the Sony label. Directed by Award winning Director of Photography Jeff Baynes for 'Eye Eye Ltd'/'Tatooist International' Production companies; Heather, Mike, Paul and Shovell were filmed together during the choruses with Heather in the driving seat of a classic black convertible American Cadillac with their bandmates as passengers all singing along or in a variety of places such riding in a classic Jag with Heather in the driving seat around the bustling American streets, driving past trams, and along a freeway. Heather has since admitted that at the time they were not qualified to drive and kept turning the wheel in the wrong direction. Other notable landmarks seen include the Park Bowl and Xing seen on the road.
There are also some internal scenes in a studio with Heather dancing and singing to camera with their three bandmates dancing behind them There are also close-ups on Paul's hands playing chords on the piano and Shovell's drumming.
Live performances
Since its release, M People have continued to perform this song as their show opener for all their tours to this day, and the refrain "I'm coming..." is what Heather sings off-stage before making their entrance to the instrumental.
Remixes
Remixes of the single were provided by Roger S., Macready, Da Silva and John Digweed and M People themselves who also included the original Album mix of the single alongside the Radio Edit and Master Mix.
Airplay
"Renaissance" was serviced to radio three weeks before physical release when "Don't Look Any Further" was still in the Airplay Top 30 from two months earlier. It entered the Top 50 at number 45 then moved up 26 places in its second week to number 19, finally peaking at number 6. The new instrumental, tighter verses and stronger structure plus its use as a theme tune of a popular BBC show, The Living Soap, all propelled the song's success very quickly.
"Renaissance" has the distinction of being the only ever M People single to be written and recorded in just one day. This was partly because the band were under pressure from their record label, DeConstruction, to have finished and finalised the album by the end of the Summer 1993. Therefore, the tweaking of the track was essential to become a carefree dance single.

In theoretical physics, a preferred frame or privileged frame is usually a special hypothetical frame of reference in which the laws of physics might appear to be identifiably different (simpler) from those in other frames.
In theories that apply the principle of relativity to inertial motion, physics is the same in all inertial frames, and is even the same in all frames under the principle of general relativity.
Preferred frame in aether theory
In theories that presume that light travels at a fixed speed relative to an unmodifiable and detectable luminiferous aether, a preferred frame would be a frame in which this aether would be stationary. In 1887, Michelson and Morley tried to identify the state of motion of the aether. To do so, they assumed Galilean relativity to be satisfied by clocks and rulers; that is, that the length of rulers and periods of clocks are invariant under any Galilean frame change. Under such an hypothesis, the aether should have been observed.
By comparing measurements made in different directions and looking for an effect due to the Earth's orbital speed, their experiment famously produced a null result. As a consequence, within Lorentz ether theory the Galilean transformation was replaced by the Lorentz transformation. However, in Lorentz aether theory the existence of an undetectable aether is assumed and the relativity principle holds. The theory was quickly replaced by special relativity, which gave similar formulas without the existence of an unobservable aether. All inertial frames are physically equivalent, in both theories. More precisely, provided that no phenomenon violates the principle of relativity of motion, there is no means to measure the velocity of an inertial observer with regard to a possible medium of propagation of quantum waves.
Inertial frames preferred above noninertial frames
Although all inertial frames are equivalent under classical mechanics and special relativity, the set of all inertial frames is privileged over non-inertial frames in these theories. Inertial frames are privileged because they do not have physics whose causes are outside of the system, while non-inertial frames do. Einstein gives the following example: suppose two equally-composed elastic bodies are in space and distant from each other such that the interaction between them can be ignored, and whose only relative motion is a uniform rigid rotation around the line joining the centers of both bodies (like spinning wheels around an axle). One of the bodies is a sphere, and the other is a spheroid, a squashed sphere. The observable proper physical shape of the bodies remains the same in all frames. The non-rotating-spheroid frame has physics whose cause lies outside the system, responsible for the oblateness of the spheroid. The non-rotating-sphere frame does not, which makes it privileged in that it doesn't require external causes. This applies to all inertial frames, who are privileged in the same regard. Einstein went on to develop general relativity and the equivalence principle, in which inertial-gravitational frames are no longer privileged, because the geodesics of spacetime explain these inertial-gravitational effects without an external cause.

Theo Ellsworth is a self-taught artist and comics creator best known for their graphic novel "Capacity" and "Sleeper Car" which was excerpted in "The Best American Comics 2010". In 2010, they were a recipient of the Best Art Vinyl award for the Flying Lotus EP album Pattern + Grid World. They live with their wife and son in Missoula, Montana.
Biography
Theo Ellsworth was born in Los Angeles, California where they lived until they were six when their family relocated to Missoula, Montana. Their father worked in hospice and their mother worked for a company that provided services for people with mental disabilities. Ellsworth has an older brother and a younger sister. They note having difficulty paying attention in school, oftentimes daydreaming during lessons. Ellsworth dropped out of high school and received their GED. Ellsworth travelled around the United States, living out of their car, occasionally returning to Missoula. They used this period as a time of introspection and to figure out how to make art and comics the central focus of their work. They sold their car and used that money, in addition to working odd jobs, while they wrote the first six issues of Capacity.
While Ellsworth tried some formal art classes, they found the instruction counterproductive to their own artistic style and vision.  They are instead self-taught. Ellsworth notes Henry Darger, Adolf Wölfli, and Martin Ramirez as artistic influences.
Career
Ellsworth's first book Capacity was published in 2008 by Secret Acres. It is a compilation of mini-comics they produced between 2005 and 2007. Ellsworth also created an additional 100 pages of material specifically to tie all the stories together for the book's publication. In 2013, Ellsworth published Capacity #8, a new issue that continues their Capacity series.
In 2009, Secret Acres published Ellsworth's Sleeper Car, a 32-page comic. A selection from "Sleeper Car", Norman Eight's Right Arm was chosen by Neil Gaiman for The Best American Comics 2010.
Book One of their The Understanding Monster trilogy came out in 2012 and won the 2013 Lynd Ward Honor Book prize given out by Penn State. Excerpts from "The Understanding Monster Vol. 1" were selected by Scott McCloud to be included in the "Best American Comics 2014." Volume Two of the Understanding Monster was released in the fall of 2014, and Volume Three was released in the fall of 2015.
Their work has been described as "a cross between cartooning and art, poetry and the nonsensical ramblings of a writer emerging from a dream."
Anthology credits and references
Ellsworth is credited as the artist for "A History of Nonviolence" which appeared in 2013 in issue 3 of the political comics anthology, "Occupy Comics." Ellsworth is also credited as a contributor to the comic "Little Nemo: Dream Another Dream." Fred Johnson utilizes Ellsworth's artwork in "Perspicuous Objects," a series of articles that explores comics in-depth by combining the lenses of visual rhetoricians with cartoonists and comic theorists.

Madtoms are freshwater catfishes (order Siluriformes) of the genus Noturus of the family Ictaluridae. It is the most species-rich family of catfish in North America, native to the central and eastern United States, and adjacent parts of Canada. Their fin spines contain a mild venom with a sting comparable to that of a honey bee.
Nearly half the species of madtom catfishes were described in a single comprehensive revision of the group. Morphology is very conserved in this genus; most of the species look very similar and telling them apart with the usual meristic and morphometric characters used to identify species is difficult. The more conspicuously variable attributes of these secretive fishes are features of pigmentation, which also are more difficult to quantify and often vary according to substrate and water quality. These species have small to tiny or fragmented ranges, and aspects of pigmentation are important diagnostic characters of each. Over one-quarter of the recognized species diversity in Noturus remains undescribed.
A number of madtom species are narrowly distributed and extremely rare, thus are at great risk of extinction. Noturus trautmani may even be extinct, having been last collected in 1957.

The 29 recognized species in this genus are:

Pauline Horson-Brügelmann, née Pauline Dyckhoff (25 March 1858 – 28 January 1918) was a German operatic soprano.
Life
Born in Beckum, Horson studied classical singing with Karl Schneider in Cologne and made their debut in 1875 at the court theatre in Sondershausen. In the following year (1876), after a successful guest performance in Weimar, they came to the Hoftheater Weimar, where they finally joined the Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach. They later are appointed Kammersängerin and remained in the ensemble until 1886, the year of their marriage. In that year they married the chemist Moritz Gottfried Brügelmann (24 April 1849 in Ratingen - 18 November 1920 in Bad Kissingen) from the manufacturing family of the Ratingen Textilfabrik Cromford.
At the premiere of Wagner's Parsifal on 26 July 1882 in Bayreuth under the direction of Hermann Levi they sang one of the Zaubermädchen. Further solos as Zaubermädchen followed in 1883 and 1884 and they were known for their interpretations of Mozart's lyrical and coloratura opera arias. They gave concerts and guest performances at the Bayreuth Festival, at the court opera houses of Berlin, Semperoper, Hanover, Leipzig and the Kroll-Opera in Berlin.
Having become hard of hearing, they died in 1918 in Bonn at the age of 59 from pneumonia. In their will they left an amount of 150,000 Marks in cash from the sale of a house in Bonn and 17 Cologne-Munich railway premium tickets worth 5,100 Marks for the care and design of the Bad Kissinger Ballinghain, a garden left by the Kissingen spa doctor . They and their husband, who had got engaged in Bad Kissingen and stayed there several times in the following years, were dedicated a small park with a memorial stone and benches on the "Finsterberg" in 1922 as a token of gratitude. However, a foundation was no longer established. Due to the inflation that soon set in, the estate became worthless.

Nematocampa resistaria, the filament bearer, bordered thorn or horned spanworm moth, is a moth of the family Geometridae. The species was first described by Gottlieb August Wilhelm Herrich-Schäffer in 1856. It is found in North America from British Columbia to Nova Scotia, south to Florida and California.
This species was split from the Eurasian Nematocampa limbata.
The wingspan is 19–25 mm. Adults are on wing from May (or April in the deep south) to August. There is one generation in the north, two generations in the middle states and multiple generations in the southern part of the range.
Larvae feed on various deciduous and coniferous trees and shrubs, including Pseudotsuga, Tsuga, Abies, Picea, Salix, Betula papyrifera, Corylus, Fragaria and carrot (Daucus).

The Northern Sun Battalion () is an armed rebel group affiliated with the Free Syrian Army and part of the Syrian Democratic Forces that has been active during the Syrian Civil War.
History
The formation of the Northern Sun Battalion was announced by Mohammed Hammou, a brigadier general who defected from the Syrian Armed Forces, in the Manbij countryside on 16 April 2014. Less than a week later, several other small groups and individuals joined the battalion, including Abu Layla and several other commanders from the Kurdish Front and the Free Syria Brigade's eastern branch.
On 3 May 2015, some of former members of the northern branches of the Hazzm Movement, (including the Atarib Martyrs Brigade) and the Syrian Revolutionaries Front along with Jabhat al-Akrad, the Dawn of Freedom Brigades main component group the Northern Sun Battalion (making the Dawn of Freedom Brigades defunct in the process) and smaller FSA groups formed the Army of Revolutionaries. Many of the northern members of the Syrian Revolutionaries Front and Hazzm Movement also joined the Levant Front.
In October 2015 it became part of the Syrian Democratic Forces. Subsequently, the Dawn of Freedom Brigades went defunct.
In November, the battalion participated in the Syrian Democratic Force's al-Hawl offensive, and according to commander-in-chief Adnan al-Ahmad was committed to pushing ISIL out of al-Shaddadah and Raqqa, as well as from Jarablus, the Tishrin Dam and Manbij.
When the Manbij Military Council was set up on 3 April 2016, the battalion's second-in-command, Adnan Abu-Amjad, was made the council's general commander. In course of the following Manbij offensive, one of the Northern Sun Battalion's most prominent commanders was killed: Abu Layla died on 5 June 2016, after being shot in the head by an Islamic State sniper on Friday June third, in the countryside south of Manbij, Syria. They had previously been evacuated by a US military helicopter to a hospital in Sulaypersoniyah, Iraqi Kurdistan, but doctors were unable to remove a bullet to the head and prevent internal bleeding to the brain.
On 28 August 2017, pro-Syrian government media reported that Ibrahim al-Banawi, commander of the Northern Sun Battalion's Soldiers of the Two Holy Mosques Brigade, had defected to the Syrian Army in the southern Raqqa countryside; this was proven to be false, as Ibrahim was still with the Northern Sun Battalion in January 2018. On 29 August 2017, Adnan Abu Amjad, former deputy commander of the Northern Sun Battalion and the general commander of the Manbij Military Council, was killed in action during the Battle of Raqqa.
On 17 September 2017, Muhammad Mustafa Ali, also known by their nom de guerre "Abu Adel", the general commander of the Northern Sun Battalion, was appointed the general commander of the Manbij Military Council as the successor of Adnan Abu Amjad.
Additional groups that joined
On 21 April 2014, 5 rebel groups from the Euphrates basin of Manbij, Jarabulus, and Sarrin joined the Northern Sun Battalion.
The Euphrates Martyrs Battalion joined the Northern Sun Battalion in Kobane on 13 January 2016.
The Dam Martyrs Brigade joined the group on 4 February 2016.
On 10 March 2016, the Soldiers of the Two Holy Mosques Brigade joined the group. It was previously part of the al-Tawhid Brigade, the Army of Mujahideen, and Jaysh al-Salam.
War crimes
On 15 March 2017, a video surfaced that showed members of the Northern Sun Battalion torturing an ISIL fighter, who had been captured while planting mines. One of these mines had killed nine fighters of the battalion, leading five others to take revenge on the ISIL militant. The Manbij Military Council condemned the act, and announced that the involved Northern Sun Battalion fighters would be held for trial for violating the Geneva Conventions. The five accused were subsequently arrested on 17 March.

Bernhard Kayser (6 August 1869, in Bremen – 11 May 1954, in Stuttgart) was a German ophthalmologist.
They studied at Tübingen and Berlin, receiving their doctorate from the University of Berlin in 1893. Afterwards, they worked as an intern in Tübingen and as an assistant physician in Freiburg im Breisgau. They were then employed as a ship's physician by the North German Lloyd Shipping Company and spent 2½ years in Brazil as a general practitioner. They later worked as a physician in Brandenburg and Bremen, during which time, they developed an interest in ophthalmology. In 1903 they became a specialist in ophthalmology and relocated to Stuttgart, where they spent the remainder of their life. For many years they were editor of the essay section of the Klinische Monatsblätter für Augenheilkunde.
Kayser-Fleischer rings are named after them and Bruno Fleischer. Kayser described the condition in a 1902 paper titled Über einen Fall von angeborener grünlicher Verfärbung des Cornea.

It attempts to do this by supporting and promoting the work of artisans in the developing world in the following way: The Brandaid Foundation, an arm of the Brandaid project, funds the training of artisans and funds the establishment of better living and working conditions for artisan communities. Brandaid Collections, the other arm of the Brandaid project, helps sell the crafted objects these artisans make. The profits from sales are shared between the artisans, the Brandaid foundation and investors.
The project claims Josh Brolin, Diane Lane, and Jimmy Jean-Louis as its patrons. It has partnerships with UNESCO, as part of UNESCO's Global Alliance For Cultural Diversity, CARE, which advises and invests in Brandaid, the Ciné Institute, and the Saatchi Gallery.

Montanus was the second century founder of Montanism and a self proclaimed prophet. Montanus emphasized the work of the Holy Spirit, in a manner which set them apart from the Great church.
Life
Only very little is known about the life of Montanus. Montanus used to be a pagan priest but later converted into Christianity. Montanus began their prophesying in a village called Ardabau, located in Phrygia. The date of when Montanus started prophesying is somewhere around 157–172, however the Church Fathers gave differing dates on the start of Montanism. During their life Montanus was assisted by two women, Prisca and Maximilla, who also claimed to have prophecies.
Teachings
The teachings of Montanism include:
That a new age of prosperity would come, and New Jerusalem will soon be established in Pepuza.
One could marry only once.
Abandoning marriage for spiritual reasons was allowed.
Every true Christian had to have recognizable spiritual gifts.
Martyrdom was encouraged and trying to escape was seen as bad
The prophets could forgive sins.
The church could never permit apostates, murderers and fornicators back.
Opposition to formalism in theology.
A high emphasis on morality.
Impact
The influence of Montanus and Marcion helped to spur the early church to begin the process of developing the New Testament canon. Montanus was heavily attacked by other early church theologians and seen as a heretic. However, Tertullian adopted Montanism.

The 1998 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania was held November 3, 1998. Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Arlen Specter won re-election to a fourth term.
General election
Candidates
Jack Iannantuono (Libertarian)
William R. Lloyd Jr., State Representative (from Somerset County)
Dean Snyder (Constitution)
Arlen Specter, incumbent U.S. Senator (from Philadelphia)
Campaign
Leading up to this campaign, the state Democratic Party was in dire straits, as it was plagued by prior corruption allegations of several key legislators and by a lack of fund-raising. Just as in the accompanying gubernatorial race, the party had difficulty in finding a credible candidate. State Representative Bill Lloyd, who was a well-respected party leader but who had little statewide name recognition, was considered by Democratic party leaders to be a sacrificial lamb candidate. Specter ran a straightforward campaign and attempted to avoid mistakes, while Lloyd's bid was so underfunded that they were unable to air a single commercial until two weeks before the election. Lloyd's strategy was to portray Republicans as hyper-partisan in wake of their attempt to impeach President Bill Clinton, but they were unable to gain any traction with their message. On Election Day, Specter's win was by the second-largest margin in the history of Senate elections in Pennsylvania. Lloyd won only two counties: almost uniformly Democratic Philadelphia and their home county, rural and typically Republican Somerset County. As of 2022, this is the last time Allegheny County voted for a Republican Senate candidate.

Valrubicin (N-trifluoroacetyladriamycin-14-valerate, trade name Valstar) is a chemotherapy drug used to treat bladder cancer. Valrubicin is a semisynthetic analog of the anthracycline doxorubicin, and is administered by infusion directly into the bladder.
It was originally launched as Valstar in the U.S. in 1999 for intravesical therapy of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-refractory carcinoma in situ of the urinary bladder in patients in whom cystectomy would be associated with unacceptable morbidity or mortality; however, it was voluntarily withdrawn in 2002 due to manufacturing issues. Valstar was relaunched on September 3, 2009.

The Mamaku Ranges are a range of rugged hills in the North Island of New Zealand. Located to the west of Lake Rotorua and north of Lake Taupō, they lie to the immediate south of the Kaimai Range and can be thought of as an extension of it, in much the same way that the Kaimai Range can be considered an extension of the Coromandel Range. The hills terminate in the south with the valley of the Waikato River. There were at one time numerous bush railways that ran over and through the Ranges.
At their highest, the Mamaku Ranges rise to over 600 metres, and much of the high ground within the hills forms a plateau. The range is extensively forested, with the Kaimai-Mamaku State Forest and Kinleith Forest both covering a considerable part of them. The forest includes kauri trees growing at the far southern limit of their natural range.

Beverly Cotton Manufactory was the first cotton mill built in America, and the largest cotton mill to be built during its era. It was built hoping for economic success, but reached a downturn due to technical limitations of the then early production process and limitations of the machines being used. Being the birthplace and testing grounds of the cotton milling industry at the time, it has been called the birthplace of the American Industrial Revolution.
History
The founders of the original mill business concept were Thomas Somers and James Leonard, who had recruited others to build and create the mill and machines. In 1787, Beverly Cotton Manufactory was established by The Proprietors of the Beverly Cotton Manufactory, a Massachusetts company that consisted of Capt. John Cabot, George Cabot, Andrew Cabot, Deborah Higginson Cabot, Henry Higginson, Dr. Joshua Fisher, Moses Brown, Israel Thorndike, and Isaac Chapman. In 1789, legislation had shown that 22/40 of company ownership was shared by Cabot and Higginson incorporators, with 9/40 being owned by Fisher, 4/40 by Brown, 4/40 by Thorndike, and 1/40 belonging to Chapman. Capt. Cabot and Fisher were the largest shareholders individually, 19/40 together, and were the managers of the manufactory. Massachusetts legislature formed a decision on lending for the mill to be built. As a group, the proprietors were the inventors of the first methods in America of spinning cotton commercially. On February 17, 1789, the Massachusetts legislature decided to repay The Proprietors of the Beverly Cotton Manufactory for £500 of their losses and efforts in starting the mill, as a valuable resource for the community.
Early stages
Although the plant was not erected until the summer of 1787, there are port records indicating shipments of cotton being imported as early as March 1785. The business officially opened for the plant on November 1, 1787. On November 23, 1787, 1 box of "coarse woolen and linen cloth here manufactured" was shipped to Maryland, and on December 11, 1787, "1 piece coarse check'd cloath here made" was shipped to the Cape de Verde Islands. Records suggest the Manufactory machines may have been in use before the actual building for the Manufactory was conceived, most likely for testing purposes regarding the new invention.
George Cabot persuaded Thomas Somers and James Leonard, investors from England, to come to Beverly in the fall of 1787. On April 22, 1788 it was reported by the Salem Mercury newspaper that the mill's hardware had been completed, including a spinning jenny, carding machine, warping machine, and other tools. "A building of brick was erected in the second parish, near 'Bakers Corner,' at the junction of Birch Plain and Ipswich Roads."
Beverly received a visit from George Washington in the fall of 1789 during their New England tour. They made notes in their diary that "In short, the whole seemed perfect, and the cotton stuffs which they turn out, excellent of their kind."
Financial issues
Beverly mill suffered from economic problems, specifically with the costs associated with building such a mill. There were no government subsidiaries available to offset the costs, with most of the burden lies on the Cabot Family investors. The legislation was passed to protect the mill and the people, including legislation not to raise taxes to offset the costs of the mill, and prevent local competition from forming out of the economic weakness that the mill created.
Much of the funding that kept the mill alive in the beginning years came from the Public Treasury of Massachusetts in the form of a bailout. On January 15, 1789, John Cabot, George Cabot, Deborah Cabot, Andrew Cabot, Moses Brown, Nathan Dane, Joshua Fisher, Thomas Somers, Israel Thorndike, James Leonard, Henry Higginson, and Isaac Chapman petitioned to the Legislature that the creation of the mill was a major financial burden for everyone involved. Being a major asset to the region, they noted the following: the employment of otherwise unlabored women and children, the ability to fabricate almost any type of cotton or linen at the time, the low costs of cotton locally in the region (50% lower than imported goods.) The total loss to the proprietors of the Manufactory totaled £687 12s. 2d., a value of approximately $2,500. It was estimated that the entire company was worth £90,000, or $300,000 currency.
On February 3, 1789, the proprietors formed a corporation named "The Proprietors of the Beverly Cotton Manufactory." Several proprietors and contributors did not join the ownership, including Nathan Dane, Thomas Somers, and James Leonard.
On February 17, 1789, The Legislature decided to repay "The Proprietors of the Beverly Cotton Manufactory" for £500 of their losses and efforts in starting a valuable resource for the community. This bailout had a cost, however. Beverly Cotton Manufactory would be required to create a quantity of 50,000 yards of cotton, aggregately, and keep a record of all kinds, quantities, and values of the cotton produced. The record would be verified by the testimony of at least two of the proprietors on oath. A copy of the document would be kept in the Commonwealth Secretary's office. The Manufactory would also be required to pay £500 back to the Commonwealth within eight years.
Mill secrecy
Due to the nature of the new structure, the competition was fierce, causing Beverly mill not to show its wares to anyone who would potentially steal the ideas. Another person named Moses Brown from Providence had contacted the Beverly mill in a request for information but was denied the information they were looking for. In a statement from Brown, they write:
"As to cutting knives, which is found very difficult to temper, and is considered by the Beverly Workmen as a great Secret, having accidentally fallen in with the maker of theirs should you stand in need I will inform you where you may have them made by their Workmen. They refused to let me see their Knives or the operation of cutting tho' simple as it is."
The competition between the Beverly Mill and the Slater Mill, after its foundation, caused Beverly mill to lose workers as people moved to the other factory. Several workers had been hired at Slater Mill, to which Beverly responded that they would not rehire those workers if they came back. Since the Beverly mill was based on horsepower, the mill had weaknesses in future innovations, including water-driven mills in the near future. However, the Beverly mill laid the cornerstone for mill technologies in the future.
Modern-day questions about the commercial viability of Beverly mill were called into question as Slater Mill was founded. Moses Brown of Providence had stated in a letter to the Beverly mill that Beverly's manufactory process is the "first and largest" (1791). In addition, Robert Lovett, a business historian, wrote that "Beverly . . . was the earliest to manufacture cloth, at private expense, by means of power-driven machines."
Shutdown
On January 11, 1798, John Cabot and Joshua Fisher, having bought all shares of the company, sold the five and three-fourths acres of land to Samuel Blanchard of Wenham for $2630.29. Blanchard operated the factory on their own account until March 21, 1801, when they sold one-third to George S. Johonnut of Baltimore for $1,011.01. On March 1, 1813, George Johonnot purchased another third of the land for $333.33. The deed attached to this mentioned that the machinery within the buildings was formerly used for the manufacture of cotton. A time prior to that deed on 1813, the business had ceased and part of the machinery sold. It has been mentioned that the mill may have ceased operation during the Embargo of 1807 when commerce in Salem and Beverly was paralyzed. The old brick factory was burned on October 13, 1828.
The factory today
Today, the location of the factory is marked by a memorial stone at 42°34'21.52"N, 70°53'35.46"W. It is documented that the factory stood at Baker's Corner, which is the corner of Cabot and Dodge streets. The corner was the site of Baker's Inn. Across the street, roughly where Prinzi's Pizza is now is where the building stood. Oxen and horses used at the mill were watered from the pond nearby. The building no longer stands.
There are efforts being made locally to create an information display adjacent to the memorial stone to present information to the public.

Al-Kum (, officially known as al-Kum-al-Muwarraq-Beit Maqdum-Humsa) is a Palestinian village in the southern West Bank, part of the Hebron Governorate and located 13 kilometers west of Hebron. Its municipal borders stretch from the border with Israel in the west to boundaries of the city of Dura in the east. It had a population of 2,568 in the 2007 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.
History
Ottoman period
Early Ottoman tax registers in the 16th century have Bayt Makhdum/Bayt Maqdum located in the Nahiya of Halil of the Liwa of Quds. It was classified as Mazra'a (=cultivated) land.
In 1883, the PEF's Survey of Palestine found at Kh. el Kôm "traces of ruins and caves on a white hill-top." It further described it as "rather a large ruin."
Khurbet el Murak was described as "caves and two large foundations", while at Beit Makdûm they noted "cisterns, caves, foundations, and walls, apparently an old site."
British Mandate era
At the time of the 1931 census of Palestine the populations of Kh. el Kum and Kh. Muraq were counted under Dura.
Jordanian era
After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the area was under Jordanian rule. The Jordanian census of 1961 found 247 inhabitants in Kaum and 150 in Muwarraq.
Post-1967
After the 1967 Six-Day War, the Al-Kum area (together with the rest of the West Bank) has been under Israeli occupation.
The modern Al-Kum village was formed as a result of a 1995 merger between the villages of al-Kum, al-Muwarraq, Beit Maqdum and Humsa, with al-Kum being the largest and in the middle of the latter three. Al-Kum and Beit Maqdum were founded sometime in the early 19th century during Ottoman rule in Palestine. Most of the residents of the four villages were migrants from nearby Dura or Palestinian refugees who fled there following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The principal families are Rajoub, al-Awawda and al-Sharha. Following the founding of the modern village, a six-member village council was established to administer its affairs and provide some municipal services.
The primary health care facilities for the village are at al-Kum designated by the Ministry of Health as level 1. Close by is Deir Sammit where the primary healthcare facilities are at level 2.

Mirko Lulić (born 6 January 1962) is a Croatian former football player. They spent their career playing in the top flights of Yugoslavia and later Croatia.
Career
Born in Kosa Janjačka, SR Croatia while still within SFR Yugoslavia, Lulić played with NK Osijek from 1979 until 1984. According to various internet player history pages, in 1988 they moved to one of their main Yugoslav First League rivals, Red Star Belgrade where they played the 1988–89 season. But, that is not correct fact. During 1988-89 season, they played for Dinamo both in European matches in October 1988 and in Yugoslav league matches during 1989 spring. Match reports of both teams are the proof.
After 1988-89 season, they did not play serious professional football actively for three years. In summer 1992 they returned to football but Dinamo Zagreb did not give them a chance for playing so they went to play the following season for second tier club NK Dubrava helping it win a promotion. While playing for Dubrava on December 18th 1992 they were in team in the international friendly match against Albania national football team.
Later, in 1993 they returned to Dinamo Zagreb, renamed by then to Croatia Zagreb, and played the first half of the 1993–94 season, now in an independent Croatian First League. During the winter break of that season they returned to NK Osijek, and played with Osijek in the Croatian championship until 1996.

Drift mining is either the mining of an ore deposit by underground methods, or the working of coal seams accessed by adits driven into the surface outcrop of the coal bed. A drift mine is an underground mine in which the entry or access is above water level and generally on the slope of a hill, driven horizontally into the ore seam. Random House dictionary says the origin of the term "drift mine" is an Americanism, circa 1885–1890.
Drift is a more general mining term, meaning a near-horizontal passageway in a mine, following the bed (of coal, for instance) or vein of ore. A drift may or may not intersect the ground surface. A drift follows the vein, as distinguished from a crosscut that intersects it, or a level or gallery, which may do either. All horizontal or subhorizontal development openings made in a mine have the generic name of drift. These are simply tunnels made in the rock, with a size and shape depending on their use—for example, haulage, ventilation, or exploration.
Historical US drift mining (coal)
Illinois
Argyle Lake State Park's website says the Argyle Hollow (occupied by a lake since 1948) has been rich in coal, clay and limestone resources. Historically, individuals commonly opened and dug their own "drift mines" to supplement their income. In Appalachia, small coal mining operations such as these were known as "country bank" or "farmer" coal mines, and usually produced only small quantities for local use.
Indiana
The Lusk Mine, now in Turkey Run State Park, was in operation from the late 1800s through the late 1920s. Too small for commercial operation, the mine probably provided coal for the Lusk family and later for the park.
Kentucky
In 1820 the first commercial mine in Kentucky, known as the "McLean drift bank" opened near the Green River and Paradise in Muhlenberg County. In Drift, Kentucky, Beaver Coal & Mining Company was the most well known operator of mines, but there were other smaller mines (Floyd-Elkhorn Consolidated Collieries, Turner-Elkhorn Coal Company, etc.) as well.
Maryland
Dorsey Coal Company's Ashby coal mine, a small drift mine probably in the Upper Freeport coal; and the mine of the Taylor-Offutt Coal Company near Oakland, MD.
Ohio
In the 1880s, State Inspector of Mines, Andrew Roy, issued a report on the Mines and Mining Resources of Ohio, which includes the following paragraphs:
Pennsylvania
Indiana County: Graff Drift Mines, near Blairsville. Commodore Mines, Nos. 1 & 3 (drift mines), No. 2 (slope mine), Green Twp. Empire "F" Mine (1910-?), Shanktown; a drift mine, mining the "B" coal seam, mining done by machine, owner Pioneer Coal Company, Clearfield. Empire "M" Mine (McKean Mine) (1906-?), a drift mine, non-gaseous, mining a 38" thick seam of Lower Kittaning coal using compressed air machines; ventilation provided by an 8' Stine steam-powered fan, Clymer, PA. Rodkey Mine(1906-?), a drift mine, Clymer. Ernest Mine No. 2 (1903-1965), a drift mine, at Ernest, Rayne Twp., Indiana Co., PA.

Historical US drift mining (gold)
Alaska
Drift mining methods were used extensively to mine placer deposits during the early years (1899- ) of the Nome mining district. During summer, surface deposits could be worked, but some placer deposits were buried too deeply for surface placering. In addition, water to wash the gold from the placers was not available in the winter. Many miners tunneled into deep placer deposits, bringing out the high-grade gravels to be washed at the spring thaw. Most of the ground in Nome is permafrost. By drift mining, miners were able to recover much of the gold buried under the permafrost.
Gold at Nome was concentrated in three ancient beach lines, now inshore, above sea level, and buried under roughly fifty feet of permafrost overlain by two feet of tundra. Gold was usually found on top of "false bedrock," a layer of clay that occurred at the base of the beach or stream deposit. Miners initially sank shafts to prospect for the pay streaks by building a fire atop the permafrost, then as it melted, shoveling away the mud. The process would continue down to either a pay streak or bedrock.
When gold was found drift mining began. Miners would tunnel horizontally from the bottom of their prospect shaft to follow the gold along the surface of the bedrock. The tunnels did not cave in because the ground was frozen. Miners discovered old underground beach and river gravels rich with gold. Around 1900 the population of Nome was more than twenty thousand, many of them drift miners. Nome's gold fields, appearing untouched from the surface, are honeycombed with tunnels left by the gold rush drift miners. Today's miners, prospecting with modern drilling equipment, sometimes hit old drifts; this was, and is, a technique copied from the Welsh coal miners of south Wales and is much more effective than using bell pits.
California
Gold has been mined from placer gold deposits up and down the state and in varied environments. Initially, easily discovered deposits in surface and river placers were mined until about 1864. Hydraulic mines, using powerful water cannons to wash whole hillsides, were the chief sources of gold for the next 20 years. In 1884, Judge Lorenzo Sawyer issued a decree prohibiting the dumping of hydraulic mining debris into the Sacramento River, effectively eliminating large-scale hydraulic operations. For the next 14 years, drift mining placer gold deposits in buried Tertiary channels partially made up for the loss of placer gold production, but overall production declined. Production rose again with the advent of large-scale dredging. The first successful gold dredge was introduced on the lower Feather River near Oroville in 1898.

Safety and environmental issues
Drift mines in eastern Kentucky are subject to roof collapse due to hillseams, especially within 100 feet of the portal.
In 1989 the U.S. Bureau of Mines published a study of eastern Kentucky drift mines as part of an ongoing research program to characterize the outcrop barrier zone. "Hillseams" were identified as the dominant geologic cause of roof instability unique to the outcrop barrier zone, with many roof fall injuries and fatalities attributed to them. Hillseam is the eastern Kentucky miners term for weather-enlarged tension joints that occur in shallow mine overburden where surface slopes are steep. Hillseams are most conspicuous within 200 ft laterally of a coalbed outcrop and under 300 ft or less of overburden. Hillseams form by stress relief, and therefore tend to parallel topographic contours and ridges. They can intersect at various angles, especially under the nose of a ridge, and create massive blocks or wedges of roof prone to failure. Examples of hillseams are described in both outcrop and in coal mine roof to establish their geologic character and contribution to roof failure.

Coraline Ada Ehmke is an American software developer and open source advocate based in Chicago, Illinois. They began their career as a web developer in 1994 and has worked in a variety of industries, including engineering, consulting, education, advertising, healthcare, and software development infrastructure.  They are known for their work in Ruby, and in 2016 earned the Ruby Hero award at RailsConf, a conference for Ruby on Rails developers.  They are also known for their social justice work and activism, writing the Contributor Covenant and Post-Meritocracy Manifesto, and promoting the widespread adoption of codes of conduct for open source projects and communities.
Career
Ehmke began writing software in 1994, using the Perl programming language. They have since written software in ASP.NET and Java, before discovering Ruby in 2007.  They are the author of 25 Ruby gems and has contributed to projects including Rspec and Ruby on Rails. They have spoken frequently at software conferences, and they have given keynote addresses at multiple technology conferences worldwide, including RubyFuza in Cape Town, South Africa and RubyConf Brazil.
In 2013 at the Madison+ Ruby conference, Ehmke was among a group of people who announced the creation of a community for LGBT technologists called LGBTech. During this announcement, they also came out publicly as transgender.
In 2014, Ehmke created OS4W.org, a website to help all women contribute to open source by connecting them with mentors and pair programming partners, and identifying open source projects that welcome diverse contributors.
Also in 2014, they created the Contributor Covenant, a code of conduct used in over 40,000 open source projects including all such projects from Google, Microsoft, and Apple. In 2016, they received a Ruby Hero award in recognition of their work on the Contributor Covenant. After allegations of sexual harassment were made against the founder and CEO of GitHub and their wife in March 2014, Ehmke joined Betsy Haibel to create a service called the Culture Offset. Culture Offset allowed people who wished to boycott GitHub but were unable to do so because it was necessary for their work to "offset" their use by directing donations to organizations working to help underrepresented people in the technology industry. This project was featured in the Wall Street Journal and Wired Magazine. Ehmke is also the author of the Post-Meritocracy Manifesto.
Ehmke was a panelist on the Ruby Rogues podcast from 2014 to 2016, and is a founding panelist on the Greater Than Code podcast. They serve on the boards of directors for Ruby Together and RailsBridge.
In 2016, they joined GitHub as a senior developer on a team that develops community management and anti-harassment features for the software platform. They were fired approximately a year later, and on July 5, 2017 published an article criticizing GitHub's culture and the circumstances surrounding their severance. Them story was featured in a 2017 report on hush clauses and non-disparagement agreements published by CNN.
In 2018 Ehmke participated in a debate at the United Nations Forum on Business and Human Rights in Geneva, Switzerland on the topic of tech companies being a threat to human rights. Ehmke created the "Hippocratic License" (described as "An Ethical License for Open Source Projects") and in 2020 founded the Organization for Ethical Source.
Ehmke has been the repeated subject of negative reporting by far-right organizations and bloggers including Breitbart News, and has described themselves as a "Notorious Social Justice Warrior" after being given the moniker in a Breitbart article about them joining GitHub.
Personal life
Ehmke is transgender, and began their transition in March 2014. They have been public about their transition in hopes of helping others, and has given several interviews about their experiences transitioning and working as a trans woman in technology. They have also given a talk about their experiences titled "He Doesn't Work Here Anymore" at the Keep Ruby Weird, Alterconf, and Madison+ Ruby conferences.
Ehmke writes and records music and has released several albums under the name A Little Fire Scarecrow.

13 March — Liverpool Football Club is founded after Everton is split by a faction fight at board level over the proposed purchase of the freehold at Anfield. One faction, retaining the club's name and players, quits Anfield and moves across Stanley Park to establish a new home at Goodison Park. The other faction, which owns Anfield, decides to establish a new club there and this is called Liverpool F.C.. The new club joins the Lancashire League prior to the 1892–1893 season.
With the demise of the rival Football Alliance, the Football League is able to expand by inviting former Alliance members to join it. Membership doubles from 14 to 28 clubs with divisions introduced for the first time in the 1892–93 season. The original Football League becomes the new First Division, expanded to 16 teams; and the new Second Division is formed with 12 teams, many of them former members of the Alliance.
Darwen is relegated from the First Division; Newton Heath (Manchester United), Nottingham Forest and Sheffield Wednesday are elected to the First Division for 1892–93. Members of the new Second Division are Ardwick (Manchester City), Bootle (league members 1892–93), Burton United (1892–1907), Crewe Alexandra, Darwen, Grimsby Town, Lincoln City, Northwich Victoria (1892–94), Burslem Port Vale (1892–1907), Sheffield United, Small Heath (Birmingham City) and Walsall.

Disability classifications
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.

Philips Augustijn Immenraet (21 February 1627 – 25 September 1679) was a Flemish landscape painter and engraver. While staying largely within the traditional scheme of the Flemish Baroque landscape, Immenraet introduced a new brightness and broke with the traditional compositional scheme of obliquely receding planes. Their best works already display a pre-Romantic character.
Life
They were born in Antwerp as the son of a German piano builder who had immigrated to Antwerp. Their brother was the painter Michael Angelo Immenraet. In 1641–1642 Philips Augustijn was registered in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke as a pupil of Lucas van Uden, a landscape painter.
It is possible that they travelled to Italy at the age of 18 and resided there from 1645 to 1655. Upon their return to Antwerp they became a master of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke.
They married Catharina de Hille. Their sons were Michel Angelo II, Philips Augustijn II and Andries. They also had a daughter Maria-Catherina who married the painter Jan Baptist Boel.
Immenraet's pupils included their son Andries and Pieter Rijsbraeck. Philips Augustijn Immenraet died in Antwerp in 1679.
Work
Philips Augustijn Immenraet is known for their landscapes. While their landscapes are usually in the Italianate style they also painted wooded landscapes that are reminiscent of the works of Cornelis Huysmans and "The Sonian Forest Painters" such as Jacques d'Arthois. Immenraet is regarded as a member the group of pseudo-classicist to which Huysmans also belonged. Their landscapes typically contain small figures of herders or of a religious or mythological scene.
As was the custom in artistic production at the time, Immenraet often collaborated with other specialist painters in the creation of a composition. Immenraet would paint the landscape while the other specialist painters would take care of other aspects of the painting such as staffage, architecture, animals or still life elements. A collaboration with Erasmus Quellinus II is reported by the Dutch biographer Arnold Houbraken. The Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium holds the 1672 painting The Legend of William Tell shown to the Antwerp Guild of St Sebastian, which is a collaboration between Immenraet, Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg (who painted the architecture) and Karel-Emmanuel Biset. They also worked with Nicolas Robert on the painting Cartouche with floral decoration and two parrots around a landscape, with Immenraet painting the landscape and Robert the surrounding cartouche (private collection).
Immenraet was also active as an engraver. They produced a series of 8 etchings of landscapes after the work of their teacher Lucas van Uden, which were published by the Antwerp publisher Frans van den Wyngaerde.

Annexin A13 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ANXA13 gene.
Function
This gene encodes a member of the annexin family. Members of this calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein family play a role in the regulation of cellular growth and in signal transduction pathways. The specific function of this gene has not yet been determined; however, it is associated with the plasma membranes of undifferentiated, proliferating endothelial cells and differentiated villus enterocytes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.

Politics
For most of its history, Madison County has primarily supported the Republican Party in presidential elections. From 1880 to 1960, the county only failed to back the party's candidate in 1932 when Herbert Hoover was defeated in a national landslide for reelection by Franklin D. Roosevelt. The county was much more of a swing area between 1964 & 1996, voting for the national winner in every presidential election between 1964 & 2004 aside from 1988 when Michael Dukakis was boosted to an inflated margin of victory statewide by a farm crisis. Since the start of the second millennium, Republicans have carried the county in every presidential election. Donald Trump also produced the county's strongest Republican presidential victory since 1952 in 2016, winning by a margin of over 30 percent.

The 521st Air Defense Group is a disbanded United States Air Force organization. Its last assignment was with the 31st Air Division at Sioux City Municipal Airport, Iowa, where it was inactivated in 1955. The group was originally activated as a support unit for the 310th Bombardment Group at the end of World War II in Italy and then redeployed to the United States where it was inactivated in 1945.
The group was activated once again in 1953, when ADC established it as the headquarters for a dispersed fighter-interceptor squadron and the medical, maintenance, and administrative squadrons supporting it. It was replaced in 1955 when ADC transferred its mission, equipment, and personnel to the 53d Fighter Group in a project that replaced air defense groups commanding fighter squadrons with fighter groups with distinguished records during World War II.
World War II
The group was first activated as the 521st Air Service Group in a reorganization of Army Air Forces (AAF) support groups in which the AAF replaced Service Groups that included personnel from other branches of the Army and supported two combat groups with Air Service Groups including only Air Corps units. It was designed to support a single combat group. Its 947th Air Engineering Squadron provided maintenance that was beyond the capability of the combat group, its 771st Air Material Squadron handled all supply matters, and its Headquarters & Base Services Squadron provided other support. The group supported 310th Bombardment Group in Italy. The group returned to the US in 1945 and was inactivated. It was disbanded in 1948.
Cold War
The group was reconstituted, redesignated as the 521st Air Defense Group, and activated at Sioux City Municipal Airport in 1953 with responsibility for air defense of central Midwestern United States. It was assigned the 87th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (FIS), which was already stationed at Sioux City Airport, and flying World War II era North American F-51 Mustangs as its operational component. The 87th FIS had been assigned directly to the 31st Air Division. The group replaced 79th Air Base Squadron as the host USAF unit at Sioux City Municipal Airport. It was assigned three squadrons to perform its support responsibilities.
In the fall of 1953 the 87th FIS upgraded to radar equipped and Mighty Mouse rocket armed North American F-86 Sabre jet aircraft and the 14th FIS, also flying "Sabres", was activated as the group's second operational squadron. In November 1954 the 87th FIS moved to England and was reassigned. The 87th FIS was replaced the next month by the 519th FIS, another "Sabre" squadron. The group was inactivated and replaced by the 53d Fighter Group (Air Defense) in 1955 as part of Air Defense Command's Project Arrow, which was designed to bring back on the active list the fighter units which had compiled memorable records in the two world wars. Disbanded once again in 1984.

Vaza Jato
is a Japanese anime director who is known for such series as Shaman King, Fullmetal Alchemist, Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Un-Go, and Concrete Revolutio. Their first directorial film project, Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa, won the 60th Mainichi Film Award for Best Animation Film. In 2015, they won the Individual Award at the 20th Animation Kobe Awards.
Their name is occasionally rendered in full katakana when they are in charge of episode directing or storyboarding.  They are not related to Tsutomu Mizushima, who is also an anime director and shares their surname, but they often jokingly call each other "brother" on Twitter.
Career and style
After graduating from Tokyo Designer Gakuin College (now Tokyo Net Wave), Mizushima joined Tokyo Animation Film. While being involved in the photography of Doraemon and Obocchama-kun, they studied under director of photography Masahiro Kumagai, and then went to work for Sunrise as a production assistant, aiming to become a full-fledged director. After leaving the company, they worked on video game cutscenes, and then moved on to animation.
For most of their directorial projects, Masafumi Mima serves as the sound director. In addition to Katsuyuki Konishi, who appears in most of their productions, they also actively uses voice actors they first used for their earlier projects in later works. A fan of Puffy AmiYumi, when they asked them to sing a theme song for an anime, they gladly agreed to it, which led them to sing the theme song of Oh! Edo Rocket. In addition, the August 2007 issue of Newtype featured a photo of Mizushima with a big smile on their face surrounded by Puffy.
Mizushima often mentions Hideaki Anno as an anime director that they respect, and when they were asked to direct Hanamaru Kindergarten by Gainax, a company that has a close relationship with him, they revealed that they accepted the job because it was a different direction for them and because it was meaningful to them to work with the staff. In addition, they highly praised Ayahi Takagaki, who appeared in the Mobile Suit Gundam 00 series, and praised "Kigurumi Planet", which was used as the ending theme for Hanamaru Kindergarten, as a song made possible only by them
In 2011, they participated as a member of the selection and evaluation committee for the "Young Animator Training Project 2011" organized by the Japanese Animation Creators Association.
Mizushima has a hobby of egosurfing and has often admitted that they search for opinions of their work on 2chan, Twitter, blogs, etc.

Alexander Vasilyevich Maslyakov () (born November 24, 1941 in Sverdlovsk, USSR) is a prominent Soviet and Russian television game show host.  They are a well known, iconic figure throughout the former USSR, having been on the screen for the greater part of most people's lives. Since 1964, the leader and presenter of the TV show «KVN». In this they compare with personalities such as Bob Barker or Dick Clark on American television.
Game shows
Maslyakov has been working in television since 1964. They have hosted numerous game shows in this time, including «Allo, my ishchem talanty» [Hello, we're looking for talents], «Adresa molodykh» [Addresses of young ones], «Veselye rebyata» [Fun kids], the long-running «A nu-ka, devushki» [Come on, girls], in which young women competed against one another in skills such as cooking, dancing, or milking cows, and its short-lived counterpart for young men, «A nu-ka parni». They were also the first host (1974) of what subsequently became one of Russia's longest-running game shows, «Chto? Gde? Kogda?» [What? Where? When?].
Maslyakov was the regular host of Soviet coverage of World Festivals of Youth and Students, held in such major world capitals as Sofia, Havana, (East) Berlin, Pyongyang, and Moscow, as well as hosting a number of popular Soviet Eurovision-style lip-synching song competitions over the years.
KVN
Maslyakov is most famous, however, for their involvement in the game show KVN (Club of the happy and inventive), a game show nearly as long-lived as «Chto? Gde? Kogda?», in which teams of enthusiastic and clever young people (usually university students) compete against one another in a series of improvised and rehearsed comedic and musical skits and witty repartee (and occasionally cutting-edge politically risque satire and social commentary) in front of a live audience and a jury of stars of stage and screen. KVN went on the air in 1961, and Maslyakov became its host in 1964, while still a student himself. They have remained at the helm ever since, and now runs the production company that owns the show itself and all spinoff rights. Maslyakov is currently the president of the International Union of KVN and the host of all the games of the Major League of KVN as well as of the annual KVN festivals in Sochi and Jūrmala.
Education and awards
Maslyakov graduated in 1966 from the Moscow Institute of Transport Engineers and in 1968 they completed Higher Courses for Television Workers.  They are a Merited Figure of the Arts of the Russian Federation, 1994 laureate of the Ovation prize, and a member of the Academy of Russian Television. In 2002 they were awarded the highest honor of the Academy of Russian Television, the TEFI For individual contribution to the development of domestic television. In 2006, in commemoration of the 45th anniversary of KVN, the then-president of the Russian Federation conferred the Order of Merit for the Fatherland Grade IV on Maslyakov for a significant contribution to the development of domestic television and many years of creative activity.

"Can I Sit Next to You, Girl" is the debut single by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, issued on 22 July 1974. On 26 August 1974, the song peaked at number 50 in Australia. This version has lead vocals performed by Dave Evans prior to theirs being replaced by Bon Scott, as well as drums by ex-Masters Apprentices member Colin Burgess, and bass guitar by ex-The Easybeats member George Young (older brother of band cofounders Malcolm Young & Angus Young; co-producer). Originally, AC/DC's first bassist, Larry Van Kriedt, played the bass parts, but George recorded their own over them later. In 1975, after Scott joined, the group re-arranged and re-recorded the song as the seventh track on their Australia-only album T.N.T., released in December 1975, and as the sixth track on the international version of High Voltage, released in May 1976. The title of this version of the song removed the comma, becoming "Can I Sit Next To You Girl".
Recordings
Written by Malcolm and Angus Young, it was AC/DC's first original song. The Evans version was released as a single in Australia, and the band performed the song with Evans on the TV show Countdown. The musical arrangement of Evans' version is different from Scott's and it has never been officially released outside Australia (though it is now widely available on the internet, on sites like YouTube.)
Video
The song's performance on The Last Picture Show was made into a music video, released only in Australia in 1974. Peter Clack (drums) and Rob Bailey (bass) appeared in the video, even though they were not featured on the recording. While Angus sports their soon-to-be-iconic schoolboy uniform in the video, the rest of the band present a Glam rock visual image with satins and brightly coloured costumes more reminiscent of T. rex than of later heavy rock imagery.

The Equatoria Defense Force (EDF) was a Sudanese militia.
Area of operation and effectiveness
It operated in the area around Juba and Torit (in modern-day South Sudan) and was perhaps the most politically effective group in the South Sudan Defence Forces.
Demographics, alignment and supporters
Most of its fighters were Latuku and Lokoya. It was generally believed that the central government of Sudan supported the EDF. The EDF signed a merger agreement with the SPLM/A in March 2004, although it was not clear how many EDF fighters accepted it. The Bor Group consisted primarily of SPLA defectors from South Bor. The governor of East Equatoria charged in 2006 that remnants of the EDF continued to carry out attacks and be a threat to security because they received arms from the central government of Sudan.

The Centre for Innovation, Research and Competence in the Learning Economy (CIRCLE) is
an interdisciplinary research centre situated in Lund, Sweden. It is spanning several faculties at Lund University and
Blekinge Institute of Technology. The activities cover the field of innovation, entrepreneurship, knowledge creation and economic growth.
History
CIRCLE was initiated in July 2004 with long-term funding by VINNOVA (Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems), Lund University and Blekinge Institute of Technology. It is one of the four national research Centres of Excellence funded by VINNOVA. It has established connections with renowned research environments in the fields of innovation, entrepreneurship and economic growth. Guest researchers and visiting scholars are regularly invited to enhance the exciting international research and teaching milieu through presentations and seminars.
Research
CIRCLE's research is organized into the four main research areas addressing different aspects of innovation and knowledge creation. They are:
learning in innovation systems and the consequences of R&D and innovation for productivity growth
international comparison of regional innovation systems
the entrepreneurial university and the creation of research-based firms
public policy in the field of innovation, R&D and competence building in a comparative perspective.
The research focus lies on the socioeconomic and policy aspects of three kinds of learning:
Innovation (in new products as well as processes) which takes place mainly in firms.
Research and Development (R&D) which is carried out in universities and research organizations as well as in firms.
Competence Building (e.g., training and education), which is done in schools and universities (schooling, education) as well as in firms (in the form of training, learning-by-doing, learning-by-using and individual learning, often throughout life). Competence building is the same as enhancement of human capital.

Vision Crew Unlimited (VCU) was a motion picture and TV commercial visual effects company founded in 1994 by visual effects artists Evan Jacobs, Jon Warren and Douglas Miller. The company later expanded into a full service visual effects firm.
In 1996, VCU contributed miniature effects to James Cameron's film Titanic. While they were initially hired as a subcontractor to lead effects house Digital Domain, VCU was ultimately hired directly by 20th Century Fox to build miniatures for the engine room sequence as well. In an interesting coincidence later that same year, the company was contracted to work on a CBS TV miniseries with the same name.
While the company worked on many feature films, they were much more prolific in the television commercial market, and worked on over forty spots in eight years. Their work was featured in ads for the majority of car brands as well as Coca-Cola, Pizza Hut, and Geico.
In 1998, Jacobs and John Hoffman were nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Miniseries representing VCU's work on HBO's "From the Earth to the Moon".
Vision Crew closed in April 2002. The company attributed its shutdown to a difficult business climate and the founders' interest in pursuing other projects and opportunities.

"Of the Father's heart begotten" alternatively known as "Of the Father's love begotten" is a doctrinal hymn based on the Latin poem "Corde natus" by the Roman poet Aurelius Prudentius, from their Liber Cathemerinon (hymn no. IX) beginning "Da puer plectrum" which includes the Latin stanzas listed below.
History
The ancient poem was translated and paired with a medieval plainchant melody "Divinum mysterium". "Divinum mysterium" was a "Sanctus trope" – an ancient plainchant melody which over the years had been musically embellished. An early version of this chant appears in manuscript form as early as the 10th century, although without the melodic additions, and "trope" versions with various melodic differences appear in Italian, German, Gallacian, Bohemian and Spanish manuscripts dating from the 13th to 16th centuries.
"Divinum mysterium" first appears in print in 1582 in the Finnish song book Piae Cantiones, a collection of seventy-four sacred and secular church and school songs of medieval Europe compiled by Jaakko Suomalainen and published by Theodoric Petri. In this collection, "Divinum mysterium" was classified as "De Eucharistia", reflecting its original use for the Mass.
The text of the "Divinum mysterium" was replaced by the words of Prudentius's poem when it was published by Thomas Helmore in 1851. In making this fusion, the original metre of the chant was disturbed, changing the original triple metre rhythm into a duple metre and therefore altering stresses and note lengths. A later version by Charles Winfred Douglas (1867–1944) corrected this using an "equalist" method of transcription, although the hymn is now found in both versions and a more dance-like interpretation of the original melody.
Translations
There are two translations commonly sung today; one by John Mason Neale and Henry W. Baker, and another by Roby Furley Davis.
Neale's original translation began "Of the Father sole begotten" in their Hymnal Noted (London, 1851), and contained only six stanzas (of the original Latin poem's thirty-eight). It was Neale's music editor, Thomas Helmore, who paired this hymn with the Latin plainsong. Neale's translation was later edited and extended to nine stanzas by Henry W. Baker for Hymns Ancient and Modern (London, 1861; below).
Dissatisfied with Neale's translation, Roby Furley Davis (1866–1937), a scholar at St John's College, Cambridge, wrote a new version for The English Hymnal of 1906. Davis was assistant master at Weymouth College and a scholar of the works of Tacitus, especially their book on Agricola. This version was also used in the popular Carols for Choirs'' series by David Willcocks.

Legendary Eleven is a football/soccer video game developed by the Spanish company Eclipse Games and released in 2018 for PC and consoles PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch and Xbox One.
Gameplay
Inspired by arcade-type football/soccer video games, the game recreates the style of football/soccer of the 70s, 80s and 90s. Its style is purely arcade where the important thing is the direct football/soccer, hard entrances and spectacular shots from midfield that can end in a goal.
However, the title incorporates a certain strategic component that complements its arcade nature, such as, for example, the options to choose different types of formations and strategies, controls that will allow giving measured passes to the gap, make smooth and strong steals of the ball. Likewise, the Super Shot is available, a shot that is almost always a goal but that takes several seconds to be activated after charging a maximum energy bar with passes and dribbles (which remains empty if the ball is lost ).
To these simple mechanics are added the stickers that add improvements to the defenders, the midfield, the forwards and even influencing the refereeing decisions. These stickers are chosen just before each game with a maximum of 4 available.
The title features various types of climates with their respective turf aspects such as rain, dry grass, or snowy pitch. As a curiosity, the billboards of the field have trademark names with changed letters.
With simple and intuitive controls, the video game only presents two different game modes: Friendly Matches and Championships. As for the championships are available Africa Cup, Asian Cup, Copa América, European Championship and World Cup.
Selections
36 national teams are present in the game:
In the game, it appears as Korea.
Reception
According to Metacritic, the game is rated 54 out of 100 according to critics, and 6.0 out of 10 according to users. Critics praise the ease of use and the sticker system, but have qualms regarding limited options, animation flaws, and limited audio.

Can We Get Together is a charity compilation album benefiting those affected by the assassination attempt on member of congress Gabby Giffords. The project was the creative vision of University of Arizona law student Robert Current to benefit the victims that didn't have insurance, with proceeds to Homicide Survivors of Tucson. The album featured 117 Southern Arizona musicians, plus various local Tucson studios, engineers, and producers, and was released through the iTunes Store, Amazon.com and in a double CD with national distribution on March 14, 2011 through unknown indie label CoSeismic Records. Later that year the concept was taken by Luz de Vida, another album featuring some of the same artists as Can We Get Together.
The album features a wide range of music from University of Arizona music professors performing classical works, to local Tucson musicians performing styles including Rap, Hip-Hop, Punk Rock, Christian, Blues, Big Band Swing, Reggae, Folk, Adult Contemporary, and Mariachi music. Many of the artists had a close personal connection to the 2011 Tucson shooting, and several songs were written specifically about the shooting.
Studios in Southern Arizona that contributed time listed in the liner notes include Audioconfusion Studios, Billy Joseph Productions, Black Scorpion and Far Out Musicians, Chukshon Recording Studio, Daveguitar Sound, Delicious Delicious, Draco Studios, Gary Ray Recordings, Jack Miller Productions, JTG Studio, Live Sound at Crowder Hall at University of Arizona, Live Sound at Pima Community College Recital Hall, Luna Studios, Next Door Studios, OG7 Studios, The Den Studios, The University of Arizona School of Music, Wavelab, and Wet Kitchen Studios.
Reception
The country music single “Ken I Go Fishin'” by the Chip Ritter Band was released two weeks before the album on March 1, 2011 to promote it. The radio version is shorter than the album version.
Local media attention for Can We Get Together was very high in Tucson, receiving praise for its charitable purpose and large scale accomplishment based entirely locally without outside funding. One source stated, "Punk rock bands and sentimental tribute albums don't normally go hand in hand, but Wax 78 is no typical punk band", and went on to state that their participation "belies the punk genre's reputation for hard-edged nihilism".
However, the album did not receive wide acknowledgment outside of Tucson, and what few international reviews can be found state it was a slightly above average commercial release. Cross Rhythms gave it only 7 of 10 stars saying the title track was “rather dull and repetitive effort” and after praising several songs, they noted “some of the tracks are of little more than demo quality but with handsomely designed packaging and such a worthy because it is easy to overlook a few damp squibs.”
With local attention building, the small indie album was quickly and completely eclipsed by Songs for Japan, a charity album released 11 days later on March 25. The latter album highlighted a larger tragedy affecting more people, featured internationally known artists, was promoted by the music industry's "big four" record labels (EMI, Sony, Universal, and Warner), featured 8 more songs (38 vs. 30) and sold for less than half the price. Ironically, the Can We Get Together album's first track on disk two was titled “Tsunami” (which SeaShell Radio had previously performed at a vigil for Giffords and the other shooting victims) and was written long before the Japanese tsunami.
Track listing
The album features 30 tracks.

Michael Wayne Carvin (born December 12, 1944) is an American jazz drummer.
Biography
Born in Houston, Texas, Carvin began their musical training at the age of six with their father, one of the top drummers in Houston. By the age of twelve, Carvin began playing professionally and won what would be the first of five consecutive Texas rudimental championships. Carvin's career has included two years as a staff drummer with Motown Records, as well as studio and television work on the West Coast.
Joining Freddie Hubbard's band in 1973, Carvin moved to New York City, where they gained a reputation as one of the most formidable drummers on the jazz scene. A prime example of their work with Hubbard can be seen on the Mosaic Records/Jazz Icons DVD released in fall 2011 featuring Carvin with Hubbard's very first touring group.
In addition to leading their own bands, Carvin has played and recorded with Dizzy Gillespie, Dexter Gordon, Jackie McLean, Hank Jones, McCoy Tyner, Illinois Jacquet, Pharoah Sanders, Bobby Hutcherson, James Moody, Hampton Hawes, Ruth Brown, Johnny Hartman, Abbey Lincoln, Jimmy Smith, Hugh Masekela, Alice Coltrane, Cecil Taylor, Charles Brown, Terumasa Hino, Bobby Watson, Billy Bang, and many others.
Carvin has recorded on more than 250 albums.  They are also a drum teacher and clinician.

They spent two years in and out of hospitals, stopped screenwriting and got into the New York underground rap battle scene under the alias “Luna.” They applied to the graduate filmmaking program and was admitted in 2006, but during orientation week suffered another psychotic episode, had to be hospitalized and withdrew from the program. During their depression they got a job in construction and reapplied to NYU in 2007 where they met their wife and collaborator Kristina Nikolova. There they also met their professor Spike Lee who became a mentor and offered to executive produce a rap musical they had written while in the bipolar swings about the Apocalypse. During their work their wife suggested they write another script which came from the perspective of having overcome their struggle with bipolar so that it may offer others a path out. Taking their wife's advice, they wrote the script and showed it to Spike who is a executive produced the film which would be their feature debut, originally titled Mania Days, starring Katie Holmes and Luke Kirby - a love story between two bipolar poets who bring out all the horror and beauty of their condition, until they have to choose between sanity and love. Dalio began studying music in 2013 and after developing a passion for it, decided to score the film, composing and producing all the music himself.

The Press Council was a British voluntary press organisation founded under threat of statutory regulation as the General Council in 1953, with a non-binding regulatory framework. Through most of its history the council was funded by newspaper proprietors, with the stated aim of maintaining high standards of ethics in journalism. The General Council was reformed as the Press Council in 1962, with 20 per cent lay members. In 1980 the National Union of Journalists withdrew from membership. In 1991, the Press Council was replaced by the Press Complaints Commission.
First era: 1947–1962
The first Royal Commission on the Press recommended in 1949 that a General Council of the Press should be formed to govern the behaviour of the print media. In response to a threat of statutory regulation, the General Council of the Press was formed in 1953, membership being restricted to newspaper editors, funded by newspaper proprietors. By the time of the Second Royal Commission on the Press in 1962, the General Council had been subject to considerable criticism. The commission's report demanded improvement, particularly the inclusion of members that were not employed by print media.
Second era: 1962–1980
In 1962, following the recommendations of the Second Royal Commission on the Press, the Press Council was formed. Twenty percent of the membership were required to be lay members, who were not employed by a newspaper.
In the latter half of 1967, the Press Council Headquarters were moved from Ludgate House to Salisbury Square, a location the Press Council described as the 'very centre of London's newspaper land'.
During this period the Press Council published a series of guidance booklets.
Contempt of Court (1967)
Privacy (1971)
Defamation (1973)
The Press Council was criticised extensively in the Younger report on Privacy in 1973 and in the report of the Third Royal Commission on the Press, in 1977. The third Commission urged the development of a written Code of Practice. The Press Council rejected this proposal, and in 1980, the NUJ withdrew from membership on the grounds that the council was incapable of reform.
Third era: 1980–1991
The Press Council had lost the confidence of many in the media, and the 1980s saw what people labelled as some of the worst excesses of unethical journalism and intrusions into privacy by the tabloid press. In response to two Private Members' Bills promoting privacy laws, the government set up a committee chaired by David Calcutt QC to investigate in 1989. At the same time, under the chairpersonship of Louis Blom-Cooper, the Press Council transferred its funding to the Press Standards Board of Finance and began work on the development of a written Code of Practice.
The 1990 Calcutt report recommended the setting up of a new Press Complaints Commission to replace the Press Council. The new Commission would be given 18 months to prove non-statutory self-regulation could work effectively and if it failed to do so, then a statutory system would be introduced.

Jack Leroy Shepard (May 13, 1931 – December 31, 1994) was an American professional baseball player, a catcher, who became a successful business person and philanthropist after retiring from baseball at age 25 following three full seasons in the Major Leagues.
A native of Clovis, California, the , Shepard attended Stanford University, graduating in 1953 after serving as the captain of the first Cardinal team (then nicknamed the Indians) to play in the College World Series. They signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates upon graduation on June 16 and made their Major League debut three days later against the St. Louis Cardinals at Sportsman's Park, substituting for starting catcher Mike Sandlock and singling in two at bats against Vinegar Bend Mizell. They also made two errors in the field. They spent part of the 1953 season in minor league baseball, playing in 84 games for the Denver Bears of the Class A Western League and batting .324, before returning to the Pirates for good from 1954–1956.
The Pirates of the mid-1950s were at one of the low ebbs of their history. Shepard's 1954–1956 clubs averaged 94 losses (against only 60 wins) per season. Despite their struggles, and their first-game jitters in 1953, Shepard gained a reputation as a stalwart defensive player, batted .304 in their first full season (when they were named Pirates' rookie of the year and selected to The Sporting News' all-rookie team) and became one of the team leaders. Their 1956 manager, Bobby Bragan, said of him, "Shepard was the most intelligent catcher I've known. They handled pitchers well and could throw. They were good on plays at the plate. Fearless."
But Shepard's off-seasons were spent continuing their education at Stanford, where they obtained master's degrees in business and education. After serving as Pittsburgh's regular catcher in 1956, appearing in a career-high 100 games, they announced their retirement to become development director at their alma mater and begin a full-time career in business. All told, they played in 278 MLB games, and collected 195 hits.
They served as president and chief executive of a San Francisco-area telecommunications firm and a baseball equipment and indoor baseball and entertainment center company, and was a management consultant as well as a philanthropist on behalf of multiple Palo Alto, California-area institutions. They were a member of the Stanford and Fresno County athletic halls of fame.
Jack Shepard died at age 63 from cancer in Atherton, California.

Ori Gersht (born 1967) is an Israeli fine art photographer.  They are a professor of photography at the University for the Creative Arts in Rochester, Kent, England.
Biography
Ori Gersht was born in Tel Aviv. They graduated in Photography, Film and Video from University of Westminster, London and studied for an M.A. in Photography from the Royal College of Art, London.
Art career
Gersht has exhibited widely in museums and galleries since the early 1990s.  They are represented by Angles Gallery in Los Angeles, CRG Gallery in New York, Ben Brown Fine Arts in London, and Noga Gallery in Tel Aviv. In 2012, Gersht's show History Repeating was mounted at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.
Artistic themes
Gersht engages the themes of life, death, violence, and beauty. Their photographs and films transcribe images of sites of historical significance—the Judean Desert, Sarajevo, Auschwitz, the Galicia region of Ukraine, the Lister Route in the Pyrenees (on which Walter Benjamin made their ill-fated exodus from Nazi-occupied France)—into ciphers of psychological disruption. Such scenes may not seem out of the ordinary unto themselves, but, through the artist's focused attention and treatment they evoke the emotional resonance of what has transpired—most often, violence, and, more significantly, the ghosts of war's most egregious detritus, its refugees.
Pervasive in Gersht's work is the landscape, as a place, an idea, and an art historical trope. Their films and photographs may be compared to paintings in their display—from their unhindered access (no Plexiglas separates their surfaces from the viewer) to the frames surrounding the monitors on which the films often play. Moreover, the vistas and horizons of, for instance, "Between Places" (1998–2000), "White Noise" (1999–2000), "The Clearing/Liquidation" (2005), and "Evaders" (2009), recall Romantic depictions of the sublime. They conjure precedents in both photography, such as the vistas of Andreas Gursky and the landscapes of the American South by Sally Mann, and painting, by J.M.W. Turner, Caspar David Friedrich, and even Mark Rothko.
In their still life series Gersht investigated the relationships between photography, technology and optical perception, at a pivotal moment in the history of photography where digital technology both threatens a crisis and promises a breakthrough. Research into the early history of the medium of photography is brought together with theoretical discourse, creating, still image and films that (literally) explode the genre of still life, the beautiful and destructive results captured using cutting-edge technology. In "Pomegranate", a film that references Juan Sanchez Cotan's 17th-century still life and Harold Edgerton's stroboscopic photography, a high velocity bullet flies across the frame in slow motion and obliterates a suspended pomegranate fruit, bursting it open and wheeling it slowly into the air like a smashed violated mouth spraying seeds. A peaceful image is transformed into bloodshed, and a dialogue is established between stillness and motion, peace and violence.
Gersht's photographs and films provide a meditation on life, loss, destiny and chance. Allusions to the catastrophic violence of the French Revolution, the Spanish Civil War, the bombing of Hiroshima, and the suicide bombs that Gersht anticipated during their childhood in Israel can all be found in this work. As such, it reminds us of our past, present, and future, and, above all, the fragility of life itself.

The blue-winged pitta (Pitta moluccensis) is a passerine bird in the family Pittidae and Southeast Asia. It forms a superspecies with three other pittas, the Indian pitta (P. brachyura), the fairy pitta (P. nympha) and the mangrove pitta (P. megarhyncha). A colourful bird, it has a black head with a buff stripe above the eye, a white collar, greenish upper parts, blue wings, buff underparts and a reddish vent area. Its range extends from India to Malaysia, Indonesia, southern China and the Philippines. Its habitat is moist woodland, parks and gardens and it avoids dense forest. It feeds mainly on insects and worms. It breeds in the spring, building an untidy spherical nest on the ground, often near water and between tree roots. A clutch of about five eggs is laid and incubated by both parents, hatching after about sixteen days.
Taxonomy
The blue-winged pitta was described by the German naturalist Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller in 1776 and given the binomial name Turdus moluccensis. Statius Müller's description was based on a plate showing the "Merle des Moluques" published by Comte de Buffon in their Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle. The French name and the specific epithet moluccensis refer to the Moluccas (the Maluku Islands). This was an error as the range of the species does not extend as far east. The type locality was amended in 1963 to Malacca on the Malay Peninsula. The species is now placed in the genus Pitta that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816. The species is monotypic.
The blue-winged pitta forms a superspecies with the Indian pitta (P. brachyura), fairy pitta (P. nympha) and mangrove pitta (P. megarhyncha). Alternate common names include: lesser blue-winged pitta, the little blue-winged pitta, the Moluccan pitta, the brève à ailes bleues (French), the Kleine Blauflügelpitta (German) and the pita aliazul (Spanish).
Description
Measuring in length, the blue-winged pitta has a black head with a buff-coloured supercilium, white chin and buff underparts. The shoulders and mantle are greenish, the wings are bright blue, and the vent is reddish. The bill is black, eyes are brown and the legs pale pink. It has a very short tail. Juveniles have similar patterned plumage but are duller. It resembles the mangrove pitta but can be distinguished by its shorter bill. The loud call has been transcribed as taew-laew taew-laew.
Distribution and habitat
The blue-winged pitta is regularly found in Brunei, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, and has been found to be vagrant in Australia, Christmas Island, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Habitat is lowland subtropical and tropical forests.
P. moluccensis is found in a variety of habitats, up to an altitude of 800 m (2500 ft), including broadleaved forests, parks and gardens, and mangroves, though avoids dense rainforest.
The range is much of southeast Asia and Indochina, from central Myanmar east through Thailand and into peninsular Malaysia. P. moluccensis is a winter visitor to Borneo and Sumatra, and a vagrant to the Philippines and Java. It is a rare vagrant to the northwestern coast of Australia.
Diet
The blue-winged pitta mostly feeds on worms and insects, hunting them on the ground or from a low branch or perch. They also eat hard-shelled snails.
Breeding
At breeding time, the blue-winged pitta builds a large nest, usually on the ground, made of twigs, roots, grasses, leaves and mosses. The spherical and untidy nest has a side entrance and is often found between tree roots near water. In its breeding range in peninsular Malaysia, the blue-winged pitta lays eggs between early May and late July each year. The female lays 4-6 white or cream-coloured eggs with purple markings, and both parents take turns incubating the eggs for 15–17 days.

Anthony Liscio (July 2, 1940 – June 18, 2017) was an American football offensive tackle in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys. They played college football at the University of Tulsa.
Early years
Liscio attended Westinghouse High School, where they were an All-state end in football, the starting center in basketball and a shot putter for the track and field team. They were inducted into the Westinghouse High School Wall of Fame.
They went on to become a two-way starting tackle for the University of Tulsa. As a senior, they were moved to defensive end and was named All-Missouri Valley Conference, honorable-mention All-American and was invited to play in the College All-Star Game against the NFL champion.
In 2004, they were inducted into the University of Tulsa Athletics Hall of Fame. In 2015, they were inducted into the Second Pittsburgh City League Hall of Fame.
Professional career
Green Bay Packers
Liscio was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the third round (42nd overall) of the 1963 NFL Draft. They were also drafted by the New York Jets in the tenth round (75th overall) of the 1963 AFL Draft.
They signed with the Packers, and during training camp they were used as a defensive end and defensive tackle. They were eventually released the week of the season opener on September 10.
Dallas Cowboys (first stint)
Liscio was claimed off waivers by the Dallas Cowboys, who switched them to offense, and named them the starter at left tackle (five starts) at the end of their rookie season. They became a stalwart on the Cowboys offensive line for almost a decade and was only the second player in franchise history to hold this position after replacing Bob Fry.
In 1964, Liscio started 10 games before being placed on the injured reserve list with a right knee injury. They lost all of the 1965 season after suffering complications (staph infection) from an offseason knee surgery. In 1966, they recovered enough to resume their career, was named starting left guard (10 starts), and eventually moved back to left tackle (four starts) at the end of the season. The next year, they played in the 1967 NFL Championship Game, famously known as the "Ice Bowl". In 1970, they played in only 11 games (seven starts) because of back problems.
During their first eight seasons, Liscio helped Dallas reach two NFC Championships and one Super Bowl, while playing in 89 games, many of them with injuries.
On May 19, 1971, they were sent to the San Diego Chargers as part of the “Bambi” trade that brought Hall of Famer Lance Alworth to the Cowboys.
San Diego Chargers
Liscio never played a game for the Chargers because of injuries to their back and hamstrings. On September 8, 1971, they were traded to the Miami Dolphins along with a fourth round draft choice (#91-Larry Ball) in exchange for center Carl Mauck.
Miami Dolphins
Liscio never played a game for the Miami Dolphins either, because they announced their retirement after the trade became official, rather than reporting to the team.
Dallas Cowboys (second stint)
In mid-November 1971, Tom Landry called Liscio on Monday November 15 to ask if they could return to the Cowboys to replace injured teammates. Liscio reported to the team on Wednesday to start at left tackle against the Washington Redskins on Sunday.
During the game, Liscio played with injuries to their shoulders and knees. Liscio and the Cowboys won the game 13-0 and became the leader in the NFC East. At Super Bowl VI, the Cowboys defeated Miami 24-3. In that game, Liscio successfully blocked Bill Stanfill, helping Duane Thomas and other running backs register 252 rushing yards. Liscio retired after being the runner-up for the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award.
Personal life
After football, they worked in commercial real estate. In 2012, they suffered a heart attack while being present at the Dallas Cowboys training camp.
Liscio died on June 18, 2017, at age 76 at their Lake Highlands home. They were diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis after falling and breaking their hip in mid-2016 and began slurring their words. They had lost their ability to speak and required a feeding tube, according to their wife, Annette, to whom they were married since 1963. They believed playing football had contributed to their condition and, upon their death, donated their brain to be tested for chronic traumatic encephalopathy. They were survived by them and their three children.

A member of the National Public Radio network, the station serves nearly 250,000 Northeast Texas homes. The staff is composed of radio professionals and Texas A&M-Commerce students who major in either journalism or mass communication studies. KETR also produces original long-form and short-form radio programming.
History
KETR began in the early 1970s as the director of the East Texas State University radio-television program, Dr. David Rigney, developed an FCC application for an FM station that would be a teaching laboratory for students. KETR's first broadcast went on the air on April 7, 1975. The station operated in a former classroom on the first floor of the Journalism Building, with Phil Ebensberger, a veteran Texas commercial radio broadcaster, as general manager and morning-show host. The weekday programming originally emphasized local news, information, and middle-of-the-road music from early-morning sign-on to early afternoon; classical music in the early afternoon (this was soon replaced by jazz); National Public Radio's All Things Considered in the late afternoon; various public affairs programs in the early evening, including live broadcasts of Commerce City Commission meetings; and Freeform, a student-hosted rock music program from 9 pm to midnight. Weekend programs predominantly featured classical music or opera, such as the long-running Texaco Metropolitan Opera broadcasts.
In 1977, the station moved from its quarters in the Journalism Building to new studios in the Performing Arts Center, where it shared facilities with the Radio-TV program. KETR remained in the Performing Arts Center until it moved to new facilities in Binnion Hall in 2008. In the early 1980s, after Ebensberger departed, general manager Bill Oellermann obtained FCC approval and a grant to raise KETR's tower height and to increase power from about 7,500 watts to 100,000 watts. This increased the station's broadcast range from about 20 miles to 75 miles. After moving away from National Public Radio programming in the mid-1980s, KETR has recently rejoined NPR and once again features All Things Considered and Morning Edition, among other NPR programs. KETR was one of the original stations carrying Morning Edition when it debuted in 1979.
Local programs
KETR has several programs that focus on Commerce and the Northeast Texas area. Counties that are typically covered with local news in addition to Hunt County, where Commerce is located, are neighboring Rockwall, Collin, Fannin, Hopkins, Delta, and Rains Counties.

Sports programming
KETR sports programming began in the fall of 1975, with student-produced broadcasts of Commerce High School Tigers football. Ebensberger and former ETSU All-American quarterback Sam McCord served as the voices of ETSU Lions football. The first Commerce Tigers broadcast featured the Tigers playing at rival Honey Grove, with future ETSU All-American and NFL quarterback Wade Wilson leading the Commerce offense. The first college football broadcast was the Lions' 42-10 win over Prairie View A&M in the Cotton Bowl. KETR also broadcast Commerce Tigers basketball and A&M-Commerce Lion basketball, continuing to this day. KETR followed the Lions to NAIA basketball tournament appearances in Kansas City in 1977 and 1978. KETR serves as the flagship station for the Lion Sports Network. The station covers Texas A&M-Commerce football, A&M-Commerce men's and women's basketball, and Commerce High School football. Longtime Texas sports Broadcaster Charlie Chitwood serves as play-by-play announcer and TAMUC alumnus Brock Callaway provides color commentary.
Station coverage
The station is typically received well in an 80-mile radius in all directions. The station's signal can easily be heard west to Dallas, north into Hugo, Oklahoma, southeast to Canton, Texas, and east to Mount Vernon. The quality of the signal can sometimes be affected by topographical anomalies such as lakes or hills; areas north and west are typically not affected due to the generally flat topography. Too, the signal is simulcast globally via online stream at the station's website, which is accessible on most internet-connected devices.

A sand cleaning machine, beach cleaner, or (colloquially) sandboni is a vehicle that drags a raking or sifting device over beach sand to remove rubbish and other foreign matter. They are manually self-pulled vehicles on tracks or wheels or pulled by quad-bike or tractor. Seaside cities use beach cleaning machines to combat the problems of litter left by beach patrons and other pollution washed up on their shores. A chief task in beach cleaning strategies is finding the best way to handle waste matter on the beaches, taking into consideration beach erosion and changing terrain. Beach cleaning machines work by collecting sand by way of a scoop or drag mechanism and then raking or sifting anything large enough to be considered foreign matter, including sticks, stones, litter and other items.
Similar applications include lake beaches, sandfields for beach volleyball and kindergarten and playing field sandpits. The word "sandboni" is a back-formation referencing the ice-surfacing machine Zamboni.
Common technologies
Raking technology This can be used on dry or wet sand. When using this method, a rotating conveyor belt containing hundreds of offset tines combs through the sand and removes surface and buried debris while leaving the sand on the beach. Raking machines can remove materials ranging in size from small pebbles, shards of glass, and cigarette butts to larger debris, like seaweed and driftwood. By keeping the sand on the beach and only lifting the debris, raking machines can travel at high speeds.
Sifting technology This is practiced on dry sand and soft surfaces. The sand and waste are collected via the pick-up blade of the vehicle onto a vibrating screening belt, which leaves the sand behind. The waste is gathered in a collecting tray which is often situated at the back of the vehicle. Because sand and waste are lifted onto the screening belt, sifters must allow time for the sand to sift through the screen and back onto the beach. The size of the materials removed is governed by the size of the holes in the installed screen.
Combined raking and sifting technology This differs from pure sifting in that it uses rotating tines to scoop sand and debris onto a vibrating screen instead of relying simply on the pick-up blade. The tines' position can be adjusted to more effectively guide different-sized materials onto the screen. Once on the screen, combined raking and sifting machines use the same technology as normal sifters to remove unwanted debris from the sand.
Sand sifting by hand This is used for smaller areas or sensitive habitat. Sand and debris is collected into a windrow or pile and manually shoveled onto screened sifting trays to separate the debris from the sand. While effective, it requires the movement of sand to the site of the tray, and then redistribution of the sand after sifting. A more efficient method is the use of a screened fork at the place where the debris is located. The effort to manually agitate the sand can become tiresome; however, a recent development of a battery-powered sand rake combines the spot cleaning effectiveness of manual screening with the ease of an auto-sifting hand tool.
Areas of operation
Sand cleaning machines are used all over the world for the purpose of the safety and happiness of beach-goers. By removing litter, unwanted seaweed, and other debris from the beach, municipalities and resorts are able to maintain their beaches with fewer invested hours.
In addition to their regular litter-removing uses, beach and sand cleaners have been used to clean up after natural disasters. For example:
In Galveston, Texas, low oxygen levels in the water resulted in thousands of dead fish washing ashore. Raking sand cleaners were then used to remove the rotting fish off the beach before they released excessive toxins into the air, sand, and water.
The Olympic Games 2008 saw the first remote-control Sandbonis for the beach volleyball fields in Beijing Chaoyang Park.
The cleanup after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill saw large applications of sand cleaners to the area. Similarly, the Rena oil spill in New Zealand also saw beach cleaners deployed in an effort to remove the affected sand.
Manufacturers
The major manufacturers of large beach-sand cleaning machines are considered to be H Barber & Sons, Cherrington, Beach Tech, PFG Srl, Tuareg Srl, D'Hooghe machinebouw, ingeniería Flozaga Guterh Sl, Scam, Rockland, Qingzhou Rio, Tirrenia Srl and CleanSands.
There are many other manufacturers of sand cleaners being used for other purposes. For example, a smaller 4-wheel and halftrack sand cleaning machine is used for sandpits in kindergarten and municipality playing fields and for beach volleyball.
When environmental or spot-cleaning requires hand operations, an auto-sifting, lightweight, screened rake can be the best choice

Pirro Vaso is an Albanian architect.
Born on August 25, 1948 in Tirana, Albania, Vaso is one of the principal architects of the Skanderbeg Museum in Krujë (1982) and of the Pyramid of Tirana (1988). For both of these, Vaso was awarded with the Albanian National Republic Award. For the period of 1972-1991, Vaso worked in developing projects in Architecture and Urban Design as member of the largest state-owned company of architectural studies and design in Albania. Their successful architectural career in Albania included several projects of public and cultural buildings as well as residential, educational, and industrial facilities. In addition to being an important figure in the sphere of architecture in Albania, Vaso has taught at University of Tirana and was the Primary Urban Planning Adviser at the Ministry of Tourism of Albania in the period 1991-1996.
In 1996, Vaso emigrated to the United States with their wife Sier and two daughters Kleitia and Jora and lived in Athens, Georgia until 2015 where they worked in several private architectural firms and local government in the designing of commercial, educational, multi-family residential, religious and cultural buildings. In 1997, Vaso received the local "Mathis Award" for the project Facility Space Study, Town & Gown Players, Inc., in Athens, Georgia. In 2015, Vaso retired and returned to their hometown of Tirana where they now teach Architecture at Epoka University.

Savarna (Sanskrit: सावर्ण, IAST: sāvarṇa) or Savarni/Shavarna is a Brahmin gotra that comprises Kanyakubja Brahmins and Saryupareen Brahmins who are the descendants of sage Savarna Muni. The origins of Savarna gotra can be traced back to the origins of Kanyakubja Brahmins in Kannauj, Uttar Pradesh.
History & beliefs
Savarna Brahmins are believed to be the descendants of sage Savarna Muni (or Savarni Muni), belonging to the family of Bhrigu. Several ancient Indian literary works and inscriptions suggest that Savarna Brahmins have five Pravaras - Aurva, Chyavana, Bhargava, Jamadagnya and Apnavana.
Savarna Brahmins have historically been the followers of Samaveda, with Gandharva Veda being their preferred Upa Veda (sub-Veda).
According to the kulapanjikas, the genealogical chronicles of some Bengali Brahmin communities, Savarna gotra Brahmins were one of the five Brahmin gotras (along with Shandilya, Bharadwaj, Kashyap and Vatsya) that immigrated from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to Bengal in the 11th century. This branch of Bengali Savarna Brahmins is known as Kulin Brahmins, who are further classified in two sections based on their geographic characteristics - Rarh Brahmins and Varendra Brahmins.
Present
Today, Brahmins of Savarna gotra can be found across India and Nepal. However, their surnames vary from region to region.
Savarna Brahmins in Western, Central and Northern India usually carry 'Trivedi (Tiwari or Tripathi)', 'Dwivedi (Mishra or Dubey)', Pandey or Upadhyay as their surnames. Maithil brahmins are usually carry 'Choudhary' 'Mishra' 'Jha' as their surnames. Ones in West Bengal and Orrisa would put Ganguly or Gangopadhyay.
