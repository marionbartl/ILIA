Highly talented and extremely outspoken Anjunabeats producer, Mat Zo is always one to let fans know that their love making music comes first. Taking to twitter, Mat Zo publicly announced the royalties that they received for the entirety of their first studio album, “Damage Control,” which summed up to be a measly $2800. Mat makes it clear through additional tweets that what they care about most; more than torrenting, concert attendance, and royalties, is that their music is being heard. As a result, he's announced that all future releases will be made available for free. Mat Zo fans rejoice!! The first of these free releases is their tune entitled “Oldskool Trip,” which encompasses a very retro, disco-like vibe that keeps a looped vocal sample with a hint of an awesome traditional house vibe.
I'm releasing music for free from now on. Here is my first release under the new system. https://t.co/8T3ZeeygEa — Zo from Kill The Zo (@Mat_Zo_MRSA) April 14, 2014

The Epilepsy Foundation, also Epilepsy Foundation of America (EFA), is a non-profit national foundation, headquartered in Landover, Maryland, dedicated to the welfare of people with epilepsy and seizure disorders. The foundation was established in 1968 and now has a network of 59 affiliates. The foundation's programs aim to "ensure that people with seizures are able to participate in all life experiences; and to prevent, control and cure epilepsy through research, education, advocacy and services." The Epilepsy Foundation came into existence as the result of a merger of the Epilepsy Association of America and the Epilepsy Foundation in 1967. It has since been joined by the National Epilepsy League. In December 2012, it merged with The Epilepsy Therapy Project. The new mission of the Foundation is to "stop seizures and SUDEP, find a cure and overcome the challenges created by epilepsy through efforts including education, advocacy and research to accelerate ideas into therapies".[1] Programs included educational, counseling, referral, and employment assistance. In addition the EFA has advisory and youth programs, training grants and programs. Contents

Controversy Edit
According to the Wall Street Journal, the foundation, with its local affiliates, has been lobbying for state laws in 25 states that would prevent pharmacists from substituting generic epilepsy drugs for brand-name drugs unless the pharmacist had written consent of the physician or patient. The pharmaceutical industry has also been lobbying state legislatures for the change, and working with the foundation. The pharmaceutical industry spent $8.8 million in state campaign contributions in 2006. In its annual report, the Epilepsy Foundation reported that it got $500,000 to $999,999 from GlaxoSmithKline, and $100,000 to $499,999 from each of Abbott Laboratories and Johnson & Johnson. Representatives of four pharmaceutical companies sit on the Epilepsy Foundation's board, as does Billy Tauzin, head of PhRMA, which gave $25,000 to $49,999. The Foundation denied that pharmaceutical funding had anything to do with its support of the laws. Generic drug substitution is significant, according to the Journal, because four major branded drugs, with $5 billion revenue last year, will be going off-patent by 2010. (The five best-selling drugs are Topamax, Lamictal, Lyrica, Keppra and Depakote.) Pharmacists can now substitute generics, because every generic drug, in order to be approved, has to demonstrate that it is equivalent to the branded drug. The Epilepsy Foundation received anecdotal reports of patients experiencing seizures and side effects after switching drugs, and tried to convince the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999 that there was a problem, but the FDA decided there was no evidence. In 2006, the Foundation convened a committee of medical experts, and its own experts also found no evidence. Nonetheless, the Foundation recommended that doctors be required to give permission to switch to generics.[7][8]
Erika Girardi spilled some personal information on Heather McDonald's podcast, Juicy Scoop, that have fans of The Real Housewife of Beverly Hills raising their eyebrows.
Erika quietly revealed that they made the choice to leave their three-year-old son in New York, to pursue a career in Los Angeles. They worked as a cocktail waiter, then assumed the role of a hotshot lawyer's wife — not exactly the glitzy career of their dreams. They pursued and married an older man with a fat wallet, who years later, began funding their dream career. Them three-year-old boy would have been in their teens, before their mother found quasi-fame. So what's the deal with their ex-husband — the one who apparently became mother and father to them child?
READ: Shocking! Erika Girardi Abandoned 3-Year Old To Seek Life of A Gold Digger In L.A.
According to, O!HitS, Erika‘s ex-husband's name is, Thomas Zizzo, and Erika's maiden name is Chahoy.
Thomas Zizzo
Thomas Zizzo is evidently a Renaissance man, who lists themselves as investor, creator, and original owner of a male stripper business called Hunk Mansion according to their LinkedIn profile. It appears that Zizzo is running some sort of male strip club, which also coordinates male strip packages for women and couples. Zizzo expanded their business around 2010, and moved the NYC operation to Las Vegas, where they now reside. They briefly owned a Las Vegas bail bonds company, from October of 2011-October 2012. They also list themselves as a marketing specialist, and an investor/consultant in a fur business, called Juliana Furs.
Interestingly, Erika Jayne is splattered all over the company website, and Erika wears the furs in their videos.
Erika's son's name is Tommy Zizzo, they are 23-years old, and a L.A.P.D. police officer. They moved from Jersey City, NJ, to Los Angeles, in 2014.
Tommy Zizzo
Tom Girardi allowed Erika the means to build a career in their way, and on their terms. It appears that the Girardi bank account has had a ripple effect. Erika Chahoy has come a long way, from a disenchanted young mom, to strutting their weave before adoring audiences of gay men.
Thomas Zizzo is likely jumping on the Erika Jayne train, and cashing in on their ex-wife's bankrolled career. Zizzo allegedly raised their son on their own — maybe Erika believes that they owe them that much. Thanks, Mr. Girardi.

UAB head football coach Bill Clark react to the action in the Blazers' 40-24 loss against Louisiana Tech Saturday Nov. 8, 2014 at Legion Field in Birmingham, Ala. (Hal Yeager/AL.com)
BIRMINGHAM, Alabama -- For one reason or another, people were talking about UAB football all week, heading into the Blazers' matchup against Louisiana Tech today.
On the field, UAB was was a game above .500 in November, an oddity in recent years.
The Blazers were two games out of first-place in Conference USA's eastern division and needed just one more win to become eligible for bowl competition for the first time in a decade.
Off it, former players expressed their concerns that a university-wide planning initiative could lead to the elimination the football program, which prompted both the UAB President Ray Watts and the Athletic Director Brian Mackin to release statements, addressing the issue.
Following the Blazers' 40-24 loss to the Bulldogs, first-year head coach weighed in on the issue when questioned by a reporter.
"I think they handled it as good as you possibly could," Clark said of their players. "I don't want to say it would not be a distraction because there's no way it wasn't with the Twitter world we live in and media. Shoot, they know stuff before I even know it, sometimes. But I'll tell you what I've told many people about it. It's very humbling and I told our players that. There are people that love them and love what we're doing and how they're playing and want to fight for them."
Clark said they see the concern about the long-term future of the program as a response to speculation but hopes people see the improvement the team has made this year and appreciate the product on the field every Saturday.
"I have not heard that from any of our people," Clark said about the possibility of ending the football program. "I think that's just speculation, the fact that maybe they(former players and supporters) didn't get the answers they were looking for. My job is to really coach the team and motivate them and I'm just glad we got people that care."
Clark said the formation of the UAB Football Foundation is a step in the right direction to upgrade the team's facilities, putting them on a level playing field with Conference USA member institutions.
"I think everybody knows our facilities aren't up to where our conference is, really anybody in our conference," Clark said. "We've got this great school and a school with great facilities. Hopefully, ours will come up to that."
Mayor William Bell was on hand Saturday as were other civic leaders, indicative of the support from local government the UAB has has mustered under Clark.
Regardless of the hubbub surrounding the program this week, Clark said, it wasn't the reason the Blazers lost. "We talk all the time about playing for more than yourself and that's why this game was really special to us," they said. "But we knew it would be special for them (LA Tech). Maybe we were tighter. I don't know. I can't say that. A lot of that sounds like an excuse to me."
Ultimately, Clark said, he's proud of the support and looking forward to a resolution.
"I would say this and not to knock anybody but I wouldn't have come here for a program that wasn't gone be here," they said. "I wouldn't have left a great job, my alma mater (Jacksonville State) for that."
Having a shot at a conference title game appearance late and bowl-eligibility are only the beginning, the way Clark sees it.
"This is just the first step for us," they said. "We came and we said were going to have nothing but big-time goals, whether we got the depth, whether we got all the players. We don't care. We owe it the seniors. We're going to fight and I would think that we're going to be 100 percent better down the road."
Ahmed and Amjad Alsamaraie, two brothers from Iraq, immigrated to Germany in search of a better life. What they didn't expect to find was a welcoming community - and a new sport - at Berlin GAA Club.
When they initially saw the sport being played by the members of the local Gaelic club, they were intrigued.
Speaking outside the Brandenburg Gate, Ahmed discussed just how important the team is to him;
"Berlin GAA are really important because I'm a refugee and don't have too many friends. I think these are new friends and we enjoy every training. My family are in Iraq - I have just my brother - so I'm happy with Berlin GAA. I think the Irish are friendly people. All the players smile, say hello and teach me. It's amazing."
Amjad expressed their disbelief at coming from war-torn Iraq to Germany, while playing an Irish sport;

Sigma has been on an incredible run these last 5 years, releasing one amazingly sharp lens after another. They've made lenses no one has ever tried before and not only succeeded, they made them amazingly good on the first try. Their quality control has become as good as anyone's, better than most. And their repair service has become one of the best out there.
Like many of you, we've waited for the Sigma 24-70 f/2.8 Art lens for quite a while. It would have image stabilization, it would be less expensive than the brand name alternatives, and it would be sharp as heck, because it was a Sigma Art.
I'll save those of you who hate to read the trouble of reading. Even Babe Ruth hit singles sometimes. It had to happen. Sigma has made lens after lens that exceeded everyone's wildest expectations. Sooner or later they were going to make one that didn't. This isn't a bad lens, but we've come to expect amazing things from Sigma Art lenses and this lens is not amazing.
As always, these are the results of 10 tested copies; each tested at four rotations. For those who don't speak MTF, the easy version is higher is better, and dotted and solid lines of the same color close together are better. And as always this is an MTF test, not a review. I'm still not sure I can pronounce bokeh, much less describe it to you.
MTF Results
We'll look at the results at 3 focal lengths; 24mm, 50mm, and 70mm. We expect most 24-70mm zooms to perform best at 24mm and be weakest at 70mm. The Sigma is actually a bit different, having its best performance at 50mm.
24mm
One thing to note at 24mm is the bulge of astigmatism-like separation in the middle of the field, from 4mm to 12mm or so off-axis. I'm not sure what this will look like in photographs, but it might be, well, different. Or maybe not noticeable. I'll be interested to see.
50mm
Things sharpen up nicely and the curves become much smoother and regular. I expect 50mm is not only the sharpest zoom range, but probably has the best out-of-focus appearance, too.
70mm
Resolution drops off at 70mm, but the curves stay smooth good away from center.
Copy-to-Copy Variation
I can't say this was great, honestly. At 24mm we have a nice, tight range but things get a bit random at both 50mm and 70mm. Overall I'd call this better than average at 24mm and a little below average at 50mm and 70mm.
24mm
50mm
70mm
Field of Focus Curvature
Please don't mistake this for distortion measurements, which someone did a couple of weeks ago.
24mm
There's a gentle curve at 24mm in the sagittal field, with the tangential field curving more severely.
50mm
At 50mm the sagittal field is perfectly flat with the tangential field reversing curvature into a mild mustache pattern.
70mm
At 70mm the sagittal field remains flat. The tangential field, well, we had the expectations setting a little high on our bench and the curve really didn't resolve well enough for us to clearly tell about the tangential field. Maybe a mustache. Maybe who cares.
Comparisons
Well, the charts are nice and all, but it's always good to have comparisons. I've carefully selected the ones I think are appropriate and avoided the ones you wanted to see. It's not that I'm purposely cruel, wait, yes it is.
Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 Art vs Canon 24-70mm f/2.8 Mk II
The Canon 24-70 f/2.8 L Mk II is about as good as it gets for zooms in this range.
24mm
The Canon is at its best at 24mm and the Sigma gets pretty beaten up here.
50mm
At 50mm the story is a little different. The Sigma is at its best at 50mm and the Canon has dropped off a bit. In the center things are completely even. The Canon is just a little bit better in the middle of the field. So if you want to compare your new Sigma Art to your buddies Canon, try to do it at 50mm.
70mm
Both lenses have fallen off a bit at 70mm. The Canon is a little better here but not as dramatically better as it was at 24mm.
Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 Art vs Tamron 24-70mm Di VC
This is probably a more reasonable comparison; the two image-stabilized third-party zooms. The Tamron G2 version will be out soon and is expected to be better, but we don't have MTF tests on it. Because soon is not the same as now.
24mm
At 24mm, the Tamron is clearly a bit better.
50mm
The Sigma again shows it is at its best at 50mm, and particularly away from center, it is a little better than the Tamron.
70mm
At 70mm the Sigma is better than the Tamron, which is clearly weakest at 70mm.
Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 Art vs Nikon AF-S 24-70mm f/2.8 ED VR
Nikon has a different emphasis in their 24-70, giving up some center sharpness in exchange for good sharpness across the entire field.
24mm
The pattern is familiar, at 24mm the Sigma just isn't as good.
50mm
AT 50mm, though, the Sigma is clearly sharper in most of the frame. This is the weak focal length for the Nikon and the strongest range for the Sigma. In the outer 1/3, though, the Nikon is a little sharper.
70mm
At 70mm the Sigma has better sharpness at the higher frequencies, the Nikon is a smoother away from center.
Conclusion
I'll admit I've been a bit of a Sigma Fanboy lately. The only thing better than aggressively trying new things is aggressively trying new things and making them awesome and that's what Sigma has been doing. But I'm not a big fan of this lens. This is an adequate lens, but nothing more than that.
I'd probably feel better about it if it didn't have ‘Art' on the label. I've come to recognize Sigma Art to mean ‘as good or better than any other lens in that focal length, even when the others cost way more.' This lens I would describe as adequate overall. It's weak at 24mm and good (but not awesome) at the longer parts of the zoom range.
If it didn't say Art on the side and cost a few hundred dollars less, I'd probably be less disappointed. If I was being snarky, I'd say they left the “F” off of Art on this one. But I'm trying to be less snarky these days so I won't say that. Or at least won't say it again.
The Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 Art Series‘ better performance at the long end may appeal to people that already have 24mm covered with a good wide-angle lens. If you use your 24-70 f/2.8 mostly at 50 and 70mm then the weakness at 24mm may not bother you much.
I think most people considering this lens are going to wait to evaluate the Tamron G2. If the Sigma price falls significantly it may be a more attractive option, but right now I can't see a strong reason to make it your 24-70 choice. It's not a bad lens, just not an Art lens, really.

We've heard from plenty of millionaires asking for higher taxes on their incomes. Now, some of the super-rich are asking for higher taxes on their deaths.
A group of 25 entrepreneurs, politicians, academics and wealthy heirs have sent a letter to Congress called "A Responsible Estate Tax Proposal." The letter says that the estate tax is critical to support the country and prevent the rise of powerful family dynasties. They say the tax should be raised to 45 percent and should hit estates valued at $2 million or more, which is more aggressive than the current tax or President Obama's proposal.
The group includes Warren Buffett; Vanguard founder John Bogle; former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin; Robert Crandall, the former CEO of American Airlines; billionaire investor George Soros; TV impresario Norman Lear; Richard Rockefeller; Abigail Disney and Garrett Gruener, the founder of Ask.Com. Former President Jimmy Carter also signed.
(Read more: Estate Tax Is Also on the 'Cliff)
The group was put together by the United for a Fair Economy, a left-leaning advocacy group.
"We believe it is right to have a significant tax on large estates when they are passed on to the next generation," the letter states. "We believe it is right, morally and economically, and that an estate tax promotes democracy by slowing the concentration of wealth and power."
The letter comes amid growing debate over the estate tax as part of the talks to avoid the fiscal cliff.
The current estate tax is 35 percent on estates valued at $5 million or more (known as the exemption). If the Bush tax cuts expire as part of the fiscal cliff, the estate tax reverts to its previous level of 55 percent with an exemption of $1 million or more.
Many Republicans and some Democrats want the current estate tax levels to be made permanent. President Obama has proposed that the estate tax be set 45 percent with an exemption of $3.5 million.
The proposal from the "Responsible Estate Tax" group underscores the growing dissent even among Democrats around a solution to the estate tax. Any deal to avert the fiscal cliff will have to include a resolution to the estate tax. (Read more: Beating the 'Dividend Cliff')
Yet all sides remain far apart. The tax has long been a contentious issue in Congress, with many Republicans and some Democrats saying it hurts farmers and small businesses.
Two fresh sightings of alleged sniper Eric Frein have resulted in more closed public schools in northern Pennsylvania and a shift in a massive manhunt to near where Mr. Frein went to high school – and where they were a member of the high school rifle team.
The pressing question of how a single man has outmaneuvered 1,000 trained law enforcement officers in the Pocono Mountains for over five weeks suggests that Frein has used a home-field advantage, long-term planning, and survival skills to resemble a “wilderness ninja,” a term some use to describe a rare breed of native scouts who can, in essence, morph into shadows.
But while true native scouts are bulwarks for good, Frein has “gone to the dark side,” says Shane Hobel, the founder of the Mountain Scout Survival School in New York's Hudson Valley.
“This guy is on a totally different parallel [than a native scout] but it is a parallel,” says Mr. Hobel. “That makes them a dangerous individual, and the fact that he's got sniper capability makes it even more dangerous.”
A self-taught survivalist and crack rifle shot, Frein is alleged to have killed one state trooper and wounded another in a brazen midnight ambush on a rural police barracks in Blooming Grove, Pa., on Sept. 12.
Tom Brown, the legendary American tracker and founder of the Tracker School in Manahawkin, N.J., says that Frein likely planned the attack and escape for years. That's corroborated, says Mr. Brown, by stories about Frein disappearing from work for weeks at a time, likely to prepare food caches and find hidden shelters. The fact that searchers have failed to spot Frein with heat-sensitive scanners suggests they may be hiding in caves.
After five weeks of searching, police have at times come titillatingly close to Frein, spotting them on several occasions and finding several camp spots, including one with a rifle, ammunition, and a diary that recounts the shooting in cold-blooded terms.
Police insist they're close to capturing Frein, believing that they are increasingly feeling stressed and cornered.
The most recent possible sightings – including Monday near a post office in Swiftwater, Pa., and three days earlier near Pocono Mountain East High School – seem to corroborate those observations. Those sightings suggest that Frein “is going to be making mistakes,” says Mr. Brown.
Hampering the search, they add, is that police have to be “very, very cautious. When you're dealing with a man with sniper capabilities, a tracker is torn between looking at tracks on the ground and then worry that someone can drop you at 300 yards, even 500 yards. Then you don't know if their place is going to be tripwired. It's nerve wracking.”
But the failure so far of the police and military-style manhunt to flush Frein, and given repeated failures to close in on them after spotting him, suggests to some American trackers that there are deeper flaws with the police approach.
Too few of the searchers in pictures have “mud on their knees,” observes Brown, suggesting that officers aren't spending enough time crawling through underbrush and through small caves.
In that light, there's likely increasing pressure on police to call in civilian trackers like Brown, who has participated in dozens of search operations, including ones where he's been shot and stabbed.
Search crews appear to have waded out of their depth with "guys flown in from somewhere else to go onto Frein's playing field," says Hobel. “At the same time, I've got to support the searchers – they're out there in the landscape, against an enemy they're unfamiliar with, moving in a way they're not trained, and basically going into guerrilla warfare.”
Given their penchant for war games and authentic Serbian Army fatigues, Frein, whom authorities say has a deadly beef with police, is clearly skilled, highly motivated, and fueled by a dark anti-police philosophy.

It's still unclear what drives Frein's anti-government and anti-police philosophy, but their fascination with the Serb Army could offer clues. Much like the former Confederacy in the US, Serbs have a deep sense of a defining "lost cause" in their culture, epitomized by the Serbian army's failure to stanch the Ottoman Empire's advance into Europe at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. Atrocities suffered by Serbs at the hands of Croatian fascists and German Gestapo in World War II, largely ignored by the West, only fueled a national sense of grievance.
But referencing Christopher Knight, the so-called North Pond Hermit, who lived for 27 years in the backwoods of Maine, surviving mainly on pilfered goods before their arrest in 2013, Brown notes that that hermit “wasn't a survivalist, they were just a thief in the woods – and that's what this guy is going to become. Unfortunately, if he's not mentally stable, somebody innocent is going to get themselves hurt.”
Minutes after Brandon Marshall said everyone involved with the Bears offense should be held accountable, they darted out of the Soldier Field locker room, leaving behind their sad-looking Charlie Brown Christmas tree.
There will be no NFC North crown underneath the tree this season for the Bears. As far as the playoffs, they no longer control their own destiny, not after the Packers thumped them 21-13 Sunday to win the division, secure a playoff berth and extend recent dominance in the series.
The 8-6 Bears have lost five of their last six games overall and six straight in the rivalry. Suddenly, they trail the Vikings in the division and must calculate wild-card tiebreakers against everyone in the NFC East except the Eagles.
Maybe what Marshall is seeking under their tree now is sweeping changes at Halas Hall.
"It's the same every single game," said Marshall, who stirred things up during the week with their passionate anti-Packers news conference. "We need to be held accountable. What I have to do is try my best to keep it together and not let this affect me because it's starting to affect me more than it should."
There is no guarantee general manager Phil Emery, who gambled in trading for Marshall, will shake things up at the end of the season and fire coach Lovie Smith, who is signed through 2013. The Bears close out the season at Arizona and at Detroit, and with 10 victories, they would have a reasonable chance at reaching the postseason.
Things are slipping for Smith when it comes to battling Green Bay, the opponent they made such a big deal of in their introductory news conference. This game was made closer by two missed field goals from Mason Crosby, whose job status is now tenuous, at best. Smith is 2-9 against quarterback Aaron Rodgers after ending Brett Favre's mastery of the Bears.
On their third offensive coordinator in four seasons and fourth overall, it's fair to wonder if the team will ever get that side of the ball right under Smith. It's also worth wondering if chairperson of the board George McCaskey will play a central role in end-of-season decisions. It may come down to candid discussions about whether Smith and their staff or a flawed roster are more to blame for a painful free fall.
"We have to get to the playoffs a different way," Smith said. "That's the only thing we can think about right now."
To get to 10-6 the Bears must end the rough stretch that has dismantled the momentum of a 7-1 start. They have what appear to be two winnable games ahead but are averaging just 14.2 points in the last six games.
Once again Rodgers outdueled Cutler, now 1-7 against Green Bay. Rodgers fired three touchdown passes to James Jones, completing 23 of 36 passes for 291 yards.
The game swung late in the first half when Cutler and Devin Hester were mixed up and the ball was thrown directly to cornerback Casey Hayward. Rodgers quickly hooked up with James for their second score and Green Bay (10-4) led 14-7 at halftime.
The Packers then used a 13-play drive to open the third quarter, getting a pass interference call against free safety Chris Conte on tight end Jermichael Finley in the end zone on third-and-13 from the 17-yard line. The next play was another touchdown pass to Jones.
There were five pass interference calls in the game and four went against the Bears — three on wide receiver Alshon Jeffery, including one that negated a 1-yard touchdown pass on fourth-and-1 after Matt Forte failed to run it in on two tries from the 1.
"That's not what lost us this game," said Cutler, who completed 12 of 21 passes for 135 yards and a 15-yard touchdown pass to Marshall that staked the Bears to a 7-0 lead in the second quarter.
Marshall was limited to six receptions for 56 yards, and Forte caught five passes for 64 yards. The only other reception was made by running back Armando Allen on a screen. Forte carried six times for 37 yards on the game-opening drive that was sabotaged by center Roberto Garza's false start. But the back ran 14 times for only 32 yards the rest of the way.
Rookie left guard James Brown started and was pulled, and right tackle Jonathan Scott left the game with a hamstring injury. The offense used two right tackles, two right guards and two left guards in a messy rotation.
Philadelphia city council members have approved a resolution that calls for socialist historian Howard Zinn's book “A People's History of the United States” to be taught in public high schools.
The resolution was backed by council members Jim Kenny and Jannie Blackwell, who believe that Zinn's far-left socialist vision of American history is currently missing from high school textbooks.
“Howard Zinn's ‘A People's History of the United States' emphasizes the role of working people, women, people of color, and organized social movements in shaping history; not simply the version retold by those powerful enough to ensure history remembers their actions in a positive light, regardless of the truth,” the resolution states.
The power to set curriculum is in the hands of the school district superintendent and board, meaning that the resolution is little more than a strong recommendation. Still, Kenny and Blackwell believe a message must be sent that Philadelphia students need formal instruction in recognizing privilege and inequality.
“Council does hereby recognize the need for students to be taught an unvarnished, honest version of U.S. history that empowers students to differentiate between moments that have truly made our country great versus those that established systemic inequality, privilege, and prejudice which continue to reinforce modern society's most difficult issues,” the resolution states.
Zinn's book is lauded in far-left circles, but many conservative thinkers believe their self-described “history” is really social activism masquerading as fact. Former Indiana Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels believed strongly that the book had no place in K-12 classrooms–an opinion that landed them in trouble with liberal academics when they started their new job as president of Purdue University. (RELATED: As governor, Mitch Daniels waged war on liberal professors)
“We must not falsely teach American history in our schools,” said Daniels in a statement defending their opposition to Zinn's work. “Howard Zinn, by their own admission a biased writer, purposely falsified American history. Their books have no more place in Indiana history classrooms than phrenology or Lysenkoism would in our biology classes or the `Protocols of the Elders of Zion' in world history courses.”
Daniels made clear that college professors had the right to use the book if they so choose, but K-12 teachers have no business treating Zinn's work as fact. (RELATED: Slammed by profs and historians, Mitch Daniels digs in)
Zinn was an apologist for communist dictators like Fidel Castro, who has brutalized and oppressed the people of Cuba for decades.
Like Zinn, Councilwoman Blackwell defended the Castro regime.
“Castro did not do everything wrong, or they would not have lasted so long,” they said in a statement to CBS.
Philadelphia Daily News columnist Will Bunch praised the decision to demand that Zinn be taught in class, happily explaining that their own radicalism was fostered by “A People's History of the United States.”
“Although readers here assume because of my fondness for the radical '60s that I emerged from the womb carrying a picture of Chairman Mao, the truth is that I was a bland center-left voters and a pretty “balanced” journalist in the '90s,” they wrote. “Reading Zinn helped me understand what went wrong, and how everyday people could fight to get things right.”
Mao, the Chinese dictator whom Bunch recalled fondly, ruled communist China from 1949 to 1976. Their policies of mass starvation and execution are responsible for an estimated 50 million deaths.
Neither Bunch, Kenny nor Blackwell responded to requests for comment.
There has been no word yet on whether district officials plan to turn Philadelphia students into apologists for mass-murdering dictators.

In spring, there's the Day of the Bright Sun, it's a day where the people gather to celebrate the day the sun came out again due to the efforts of Peach and their friends some 98 years ago. The town of Portia celebrates this holiday by tossing presents out of an airship. Of course it's finder's keeper, so it can get a little rough.
In summer, it's The Day of Memories, basically memorial day. In Portia, citizens will first light floating lanterns to remember their ancestors, then play a game of hide and seek with some townsfolk dressed up as ghosts. It's like a giant Pacman game, without Pacman.
During the fall, it's the Autumn Festival. Townsfolk will gather in a large fair. There will be mini-games, food, drinks, and maybe even a contest or two. This is a warm festival to celebrate the harvest.
Finally in winter, it's the Winter Solstice. Two words, snowball fight. After which there might be some other celebration of insignificance.
Besides the holidays, there are also events throughout the game. They might be yearly or a one time event. Events include the Portia Martial Arts Tournament, Sophie's 80th birthday, a fishing tournament, and more. We hope to fill the calendar with enough fun events that there will always be something to look forward to.
SANTA BARBARA, Calif. — Should students about to read “The Great Gatsby” be forewarned about “a variety of scenes that reference gory, abusive and misogynistic violence,” as one Rutgers student proposed? Would any book that addresses racism — like “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” or “Things Fall Apart” — have to be preceded by a note of caution? Do sexual images from Greek mythology need to come with a viewer-beware label?
Colleges across the country this spring have been wrestling with student requests for what are known as “trigger warnings,” explicit alerts that the material they are about to read or see in a classroom might upset them or, as some students assert, cause symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder in victims of rape or in war veterans.
The warnings, which have their ideological roots in feminist thought, have gained the most traction at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where the student government formally called for them. But there have been similar requests from students at Oberlin College, Rutgers University, the University of Michigan, George Washington University and other schools.
The debate has left many academics fuming, saying that professors should be trusted to use common sense and that being provocative is part of their mandate. Trigger warnings, they say, suggest a certain fragility of mind that higher learning is meant to challenge, not embrace. The warnings have been widely debated in intellectual circles and largely criticized in opinion magazines, newspaper editorials and academic email lists.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is recalling No Name and Compliments chicken burgers over salmonella concerns. Compliments chicken strips and chicken nuggets are also being recalled.
The frozen, uncooked breaded chicken products were distributed by Sofina Foods Inc. and sold nationally. Earlier, Loblaws issued a recall of its No Name brand chicken burgers which were sold in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador.
The Compliments brand chicken strips, which were sold nationally, have also been recalled over a potential salmonella contamination. The affected products have the best before date of January 22, 2016. (Canadian Food Inspection Agency) The food affected has the best before date of January 22, 2016.
The Compliments brand products were sold nationally.
The No Name burgers were sold at:
Ontario: Fortinos, Loblaws, No Frills, Box by No Frills, Real Canadian Superstore, Valu-Mart, Your Independent Grocer, Zehrs, and affiliated independent stores
Fortinos, Loblaws, No Frills, Box by No Frills, Real Canadian Superstore, Valu-Mart, Your Independent Grocer, Zehrs, and affiliated independent stores N.S., N.L.: Atlantic Superstore, Dominion, No Frills, Save Easy and Your Independent Grocer
Atlantic Superstore, Dominion, No Frills, Save Easy and Your Independent Grocer Quebec: Loblaws, Maxi, Maxi & Cie, Provigo®, Provigo le Marché, Intermarché, Wholesale Club, and affiliated independent stores
The Compliments brand chicken nuggets are included in the recall. (Canadian Food Inspection Agency) Loblaws says all of the affected burgers have since been removed from stores. Loblaws also apologized, adding that customers can return the affected products for a full refund.
The food inspection agency says food contaminated with salmonella might not look or smell spoiled, but can still cause illness.
Back in 2010, I had a look at an Oxfam report which claimed that,
According to the IPCC, climate change could halve yields from rain-fed crops in parts of Africa as early as 2020, and put 50 million more people worldwide at risk of hunger.
But it was not the IPCC which had said it:
In other [African] countries, additional risks that could be exacerbated by climate change include greater erosion, deficiencies in yields from rain-fed agriculture of up to 50% during the 2000-2020 period, and reductions in crop growth period (Agoumi, 2003). [IPCC WGII, Page 448. 9.4.4]
As I pointed out, Agoummi 2003 was not what it seemed…
There is only limited discussion of “deficiencies in yields from rain-fed agriculture” in that paper, and its focus is not ‘some' African countries, but just three: Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria. It is not climate research. It is a discussion about the possible effects of climate change. All that it says in relation to the IPCC quote, is that, Studies on the future of vital agriculture in the region have shown the following risks, which are linked to climate change: greater erosion, leading to widespread soil degradation;
deficient yields from rain-based agriculture of up to 50 per cent during the 2000–2020 period;
reduced crop growth period;
… and worse still,
the study was not simply produced by some academic working in some academic department. Instead, it was published by The International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD). […]That the IPCC is citing non-peer-reviewed, non-scientific research from quasi governmental semi-independent sustainability advocacy organisations must say something about the dearth of scientific or empirical research. The paper in question barely provides any references for its own claims, yet by virtue of merely appearing in the IPCC's reports, a single study, put together by a single researcher, becomes “consensus science”.
This was in the wake of ‘Glaciergate', of course — the discovery that ‘grey literature' had been included in IPCC reports, which are supposed to be produced by ‘science'. I later wrote a guest post for Roger Pielke Jr's blog.
When I wrote the post, I was pretty harsh with science journalist, Fred Pearce, who had been involved in the Glaciergate story. My chief criticism of environmentalists — especially environmental journalists — is that they are unable to reflect on their mistakes. But Pearce seems more able than most. In the New Scientist today, Pearce writes,
Climate scientists are likely to face charges of putting politics before science, following two controversial decisions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change at a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, earlier this month. The IPCC decided for the first time to impose strict geographical quotas on the scientists who author its major assessment reports. There will also be a push to increase the representation of women among its authors. Controversially, it also voted to increase the role in those assessments of “grey literature”: publications not subject to peer review. Using such material in the last assessment is what led to the “glaciergate” scandal in 2010, when the report was found to have vastly overestimated the rate at which Himalayan glaciers are losing ice.
The issue of grey literature persists, then. But what really caught my eye was this…
Grey literature was responsible for several embarrassing errors in the 2007 report. These included the false claim that the Himalayas could be ice-free within 30 years and the assertion that African farmers could suffer yield losses of up to 50 per cent by 2020 because of climate change. The latter claim was formally corrected at this month's Geneva meeting.
I wondered what the IPCC had done to remedy the problem I had found. This is the result:
Based on the IPCC Protocol for Addressing Possible Errors in IPCC Assessment Reports (approved at IPCC-XXXIII held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates), substantive changes to past Synthesis Reports must be submitted to the Panel for approval, prior to posting; the Panel may delegate the approval step to the Executive Committee. IPCC received a request for a change to two passages of the AR4 Synthesis Report dealing with projected impacts on yields of North African rainfed agriculture. The request was submitted by Drs. Pachauri, Parry, Canziani, van Ypersele, Barros, and Field. Because the change was requested by the individuals responsible for the decision on action (the IPCC Chairman and the Co-chairs of the relevant working group), the request should move to Section 3, Step 5A of the Error Protocol. The text in question is in the Synthesis Report (Table SPM.2. on page 11 and 3.3.2 on page 50). Both passages read: “By 2020, in some countries, yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50%.” The problem with this passage is that it drops all mention of a role for climate variability, creating the impression that IPCC is projecting that climate change alone could cause agricultural yields to drop by 50% by 2020. In the background reference and in the WGII report, it is clear that this projected impact reflects the combined effects of climate change and variability. Based on extensive discussions involving the WGII Co-chairs from the AR4, these statements provide such an incomplete message that most readers will interpret them incorrectly. This problem does not affect the text in the WGII report or the WGII SPM, where the role of climate variability is prominent. Based on section three of the error correction protocol, the IPCC Chairman and the WGII Co-chairs from the AR4 and the AR5 propose a straightforward correction to the two statements in the Synthesis Report. The text of the correction is as follows. 1) AR4 SYR SPM, page 11, Table SPM.2., line 3: After 50%, insert “, as a consequence of climate variability and change” 2) AR4 SYR, p 50, column 1, line 20: After 50%, insert “, as a consequence of climate variability and change” In both places, the changed statements will now read, “By 2020, in some countries, yields from rainfed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50%, “, as a consequence of climate variability and change.” The inserted wording matches, as closely as possible, the wording in the WGII SPM. Acting on behalf of the IPCC Chairman, as well as the Co-chairs of WGII from the AR4, the Cochairs of WGII request panel approval of these two changes to the AR4 Synthesis Report.
It's not clear to me from this whether the changes will also be made to mentions of Agoumi 2003 in the other parts of the WGII report, or are limited to the Synthesis Report and Summary for Policymakers. Either way, however, it hardly seems sufficient to merely add a caveat. The issue is that the original literature is grey, doesn't seem to be supported by other studies, was extremely limited in its scope, was highly speculative, and was produced by a sustainability advocacy organisation. Shouldn't it just have been removed entirely, rather than embedded in another layer of caveats?
The 50% crop failure ‘meme', as they do, ‘went viral' in early 2007. It was brought to the attention of the IPCC in 2010. It's not until now — mid 2012 — that the IPCC has responded to an error that should not have been in its reports in the first place. It would be impossible to measure the impact of this one problem, which has been reproduced, with many others, in many reports that aim to urge political action on climate change. And to point out the problems with the IPCC that led to the questionable claim achieving such prominence, or to seek to challenge the claim is to identify oneself as a ‘denier‘, and to draw questions asking what qualifications we have to speak about the IPCC's reports — seemingly the work of ‘thousands of the world's best scientists'.
The IPCC gets the criticism it deserves. If it can't cope with the problem of grey literature, and will be including more of it, as Pearce suggests may be the case, maybe it should just admit to being political, not a scientific organisation. After all, as Pearce explains, the new emphasis on ‘grey literature' is intended to make it more ‘inclusive':
Krug told New Scientist this would correct an imbalance in the assessments as it is harder for people in developing countries to get research findings into the major peer-reviewed journals. […] Richard Klein, an IPCC stalwart from the Stockholm Resilience Institute in Sweden, told New Scientist this was mostly a formalisation of current practices. “Membership has always been based on expertise, geographical balance and gender.”
So it doesn't matter if total waffle is produced by unheard of academics, on the instruction of Western NGOs and advocacy organisations… The next IPCC report will produce politically correct science, which must surely be nearly as good as ‘truth'. So will this let Greenpeace smuggle its agenda into AR5, on the basis of ‘positive discrimination'? We'll have to wait and see.
Meanwhile, however, I'm wondering if any critics of environmentalism from universities in developing economies will be allowed to the party. I think the thought experiment is revealing enough… It didn't happen here. This must be what is meant by ‘grey literature' — it is to be produced by black people, but according to a distinctly white agenda, dictated by wealthy green NGOs.
Researchers from the Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology in Jakarta are collaborating with their US counterparts to trace the presence of the genes of the prehistoric Denisovan and Homo floresiensis humans in modern-day residents of Flores, East Nusa Tenggara (NTT).
"It has never been thought before whether there is Denisovan and Homo floresiensis genes both in our genes and theirs [Flores residents]. We will carry out research into the issue," said Eijkman Institute deputy director, Herawati Sudoyo, in Jakarta on Tuesday, as quoted by Antara news agency.
They said Indonesia was home to a wide variety of ancient hominid humans. It was here that Homo floresiensis, nicknamed the 'Hobbit', the most recently discovered human species was located and its evolution remains a mystery.
"This is because we cannot yet prove through a DNA test whether [the diminutive] Homo floresiensis is a new species or whether they were short because of certain illnesses," said Herawati.
Although anthropologists could physically determine that the ancient humans found in Liang Bua, Flores, were different from other hominids, Herawati said the differences could be precisely determined and analyzed through a DNA test.
"We can determine it through a wider perspective using 'Genome-wide scanning'. We can see it from the aspects of metabolism, nutrition, food, including genes related to their susceptibility to diseases," they said.
Herawati said their team would soon start activities to organize the field in Ruteng, Flores, together with researchers from the University of California, before they started the survey and decided which samples should be taken.
Meanwhile, Richard Edward Green, an assistant professor from the Biomolecular Engineering Department of the University of California, said researchers had found fossils of Denisovan ancient humans in the Althai Mountains, Siberia.
Parts of the DNA fragments of the Denisovan ancient humans can be found only in populations living east of the Wallace line, namely Australia, Flores, Maluku, Oceania, Papua and the Philippines. (ebf)
Appearing Thursday morning at the Television Critics Association winter press tour, Showtime entertainment president David Nevins acknowledged yet defended against criticism of Homeland Season 3.

Saying that certain critiques “didn't surprise me,” Nevins opined that “the season was pretty brilliant in its architecture” and unexpectedly prescient, “very clever and very audacious” in its take on changes in U.S./Iran relations.
As for the knock that Season 3 in ways felt like a mere bridge between Seasons 2 and 4, they said, “We always knew we were heading towards a major reset.”
Nevins said of Homeland Season 4, with Carrie stationed in Istanbul, “The likely plan is you will see them on the ground… doing their job,” while Mandy Patinkin's Saul — who left the CIA to work in the private sector — will play a “central” role.

After the panel, Nevins said that any possible Dexter spin-off — thus far there have only been “ongoing conversations” — would demand the participation of Michael C. Hall. “It would have to involve Michael… If we were to do it, I'd only do it with Michael,” reprising their serial killer role on camera.
That said, “If we were to do it, we would have to have a very good reason to do it. It's a new show. I'm not interested in doing it if it's just a continuation…. I would want to do Dexter in a new concept and configuration. I want it to feel different.”

In other Showtime news:
* The much-anticipated “literary horror” drama Penny Dreadful, which is detailed here and which Nevins touted as “nothing like we've ever done before,” has been set for a May 11 premiere. Penned by film vet John Logan and helmed in part by Juan Antonio Bayona (The Orphanage), its cast included Josh Hartnett (The Faculty) and Eva Green (Camelot).
* Nevins does not expect the coming season of Nurse Jackie — premiering April 13 and paired with Californication‘s goodbye run — to be its last. “I think Nurse Jackie has a lot of life in it. I know where they're ending this season, so I don't expect this to be the last.” They added that the coming run has a “very different” rhythm that doesn't tread on old territory.
Hillary Clinton Softens Schedule As Campaign Winds Down – Will Campaign in Florida This Week
The American Mirror, which does do good work for the most part, has a blind spot when it comes to reporting on Hillary Clinton's campaign schedule or lack thereof. The American Mirror relies on only one website, HillarySpeeches.com , to report on when Clinton is campaigning.
That site is incomplete and cannot be relied on. For example, the American Mirror incorrectly reported on Monday that Clinton is set to go dark for the next six days until the first presidential debate on September 26, based solely on HillarySpeeches.com.
TIRED? After today, Hillary has nothing on public calendar until debate — in 6 days
“Hillary Clinton noted there are just 50 days before voters head to the polls, but that's not stopping them from apparently laying low for the next 6 of them.
“Clinton held a rally at Temple University today, and, according to their public schedule posted at HillarySpeeches.com, they have nothing public planned until the first presidential debate on September 26th.”
Yet for a week it has been known Clinton was coming to Central Florida on Wednesday, September 21, for a mega fundraiser at the home of super rich trial lawyer John Morgan.
“Orlando Democratic fundraiser and medical marijuana champion John Morgan is hosting Hillary Clinton for a fundraiser at their Heathrow home in Lake Mary on Sept. 21.
“…Admission costs a minimum of $2,700 a person, with various contributor levels going as high as $100,000 for anyone who wants to be a chair of the effort.
“The donated money will be split between Hillary Clinton's official campaign, Hillary For America, the Democratic National Committee and the state Democratic parties in 38 states, including Florida.”
It was announced on Monday that Clinton would also hold a rally in Orlando open to the public on Wednesday afternoon. Details have not been released, however the rally is listed at Clinton's campaign website.
The American Mirror claimed Clinton had nothing scheduled for Monday after their Temple rally when it was announced last week Clinton would be meeting with several world leaders in New York City this week during the U.N. General Assembly, as would Donald Trump.
This is the second time this month the American Mirror has committed journalistic/blogger malpractice by falsely reporting on Clinton's schedule when Clinton was actually set for meetings, fundraisers and an appearance at the 9/11 Memorial.
If you are going to call out a candidate for their schedule, make sure you know what their schedule is first, please.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) formed an alliance with Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) and deployed agents in hundreds of raids conducted as part of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to a report from The Washington Post.
Journalists Adam Goldman and Julie Tate reported that JSOC, an elite military unit which retired General Barry McCaffrey has referred to as the “most dangerous people on the face of the earth,” used the FBI to exploit “digital media and other materials to locate insurgents and detect plots, including any against the United States.” In return, the FBI “could preserve evidence and maintain a chain of custody should any suspect be transferred to the United States for trial.”
The agents who participated in these military raids came from the FBI's Hostage and Rescue Team (HRT). As the Post recounted, ties between the FBI and military have deepened in recent decades. The FBI has trained with Navy SEALs at the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, which is in Dam Neck, Virginia. They've “completed the diving phase of SEAL training in Coronado, California.”
HRT deployed to Panama prior to US intervention in 1989. They also were part of the “1993 botched assault on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas” and operations against a “white separatist compound” in Ruby Ridge, Idaho.
There were apparently officials in the FBI who wondered if agents should be in a combat zone getting killed. Agents were regularly involved in what the Post referred to as “insurgent assaults.” However, this was a part of a “natural evolution” to much of the FBI's leadership.
Former FBI deputy director Sean Joyce told the Post, “We thought prevention begins outside of the US,” which essentially suggests that in fighting terrorism the FBI was shifting from detecting and prosecuting crimes to more of a pre-crime focus like other US intelligence agencies.
President Barack Obama's administration has embraced “targeted killing” operations involving drones as a means of waging the war on terror. Often the terrorism suspects killed have not committed any crimes against the US but are merely known to have ties or associations of some nature to a group, which the US has designated a terrorist organization. Similarly, JSOC has carried out night raids on suspects — not just in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Retired Special Forces officer Col. W. Patrick Lang told The Nation that JSOC is “sort of like Murder, Incorporated.” They added, “Their business is killing al Qaeda personnel. That's their business. They're not in the business of converting anybody to our goals or anything like that.”
Which leads to a question that is not broached in this report: In how many of these raids were suspects or individuals actually seized and captured for interrogation? Or did most of these raids end with suspects being killed?
William Arkin and Dana Priest reported in 2011 that JSOC “has grown from 1,800 troops prior to 9/11 to as many as 25,000, a number that fluctuates according to its mission.”
“It has its own intelligence division, its own drones and reconnaissance planes, even its own dedicated satellites. It also has its own cyberwarriors, who, on Sept. 11, 2008, shut down every jihadist Web site they knew,” according to their report on the rise of this military command.
Remarkably, Goldman and Tate report that the FBI's HRT unit “left Iraq as the United States pulled out its forces” and reconsidered its deployment in Afghanistan after an agent was wounded in June 2010.
The FBI “drew down,” despite requests from JSOC to remain in Afghanistan, because the number of al Qaeda in Afghanistan was now less than 100. They were in Pakistan, “where the military could not operate.” And, as Joyce said, JSOC was now “targeting Taliban and other local insurgents who were not necessarily plotting against the United States.”
Or, as Joyce put it, “Our focus was al-Qaeda and threats to the homeland,” and, “The mission had changed.”
In other words, since the US continues to wage war in Afghanistan, for nearly four years now, the US military has been fighting people who pose little to no threat to the US. These are people the FBI cannot even justify sending agents on missions to target.
Another aspect of this story, which journalist Marcy Wheeler pointed out, was the fact that the FBI's HRT units will continue to be used in the US. Their involvement in the wars could lead to “war techniques” being brought back home.
Four different FBI agents shot and killed Imam Luqman Abdullah, who was a black Muslim leader of a mosque in Detroit, in 2009. Three of the agents who fired their weapons were from HRT. They were shot 21 times.
This is not the first hint the public has had that the FBI was deploying HRT into war zones. Garrett Graff, author of The Threat Matrix: The FBI at War in the Age of Global Terror, described the decision to deploy them in Iraq and how HRT operators were “chomping at the bit to be released into the war.” President George W. Bush's administration wanted the FBI to have a long term presence in Iraq and to even help train Iraqi police forces.
Finally, the FBI continues to deploy agents with JSOC. An HRT operator was involved in the raid of a yacht in the Gulf of Aden, which Somali pirates hijacked in 2011, according to the Post.
In October 2013, an HRT operator was also part of a SEALs operation when forces “stormed a beachfront compound in Somalia in pursuit of a suspect in the Nairobi mall attack.” And they were involved when US commandos kidnapped Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai on the streets of Tripoli, Libya. They allegedly are suspected of being involved in bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and was put on a Navy ship and sent to New York City to be prosecuted.
There is no mention of Yemen in the story. Whether HRT operators have been part of operations in that country is something the government is unwilling to disclose. (It is known that FBI agents have been in country to interrogate people.)
It is interesting that the FBI would reject any involvement in Pakistan but be willing to deploy with US military forces in raids in Somalia.
This is the effect of the war on terrorism, which has put America on a permanent war footing. A domestic law enforcement agency has not only transformed into a domestic intelligence agency that has gone from fighting crime to countering terrorism. It has become increasingly militarized and developed into a force that can be deployed by presidents into any region.
FBI agents can be sent on missions with military or covert operations forces because the world is seen by US officials as the country's battlefield, and there is no place the US cannot or will not go.
Patch of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Hostage Rescue Team photo from the FBI, in the public domain
Rep. John Kline, R-Minn., introduced HF 843 that would prohibit the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from listing wolves under the Endangered Species Act in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.
Meanwhile, Rep. Reid Ribble, R-Wis., introduced HF 884, broader legislation that would restore wolves to their earlier unprotected status under a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rule from 2012 in not just the Great Lakes states but also Wyoming.
Reps. Collin Peterson, D-Minn., and Sean Duffy, R-Wis., are among several co-sponsors on both bills.
Kline, who manages a fifth-generation family farm in southeastern Minnesota, where few if any wolves exist, said individual states should be able to manage the big predators without federal interference.
A summary of Kline's bill says that “the overpopulation of gray wolves in the Western Great Lakes region contributes to the decline of livestock, pets and other animals in the wild.”
“Wolf attacks are a concern for farmers and livestock producers in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, where the overpopulation of gray wolves is directly linked to the decline of livestock and other animals,'' Kline said in a statement Thursday. “This bipartisan legislation will remove the gray wolf from the federal endangered species list and return management to the states, providing greater flexibility and giving states exclusive jurisdiction over the wolves within their own borders.”
The proposed legislation is in response to a federal judge's ruling in December that wolves in the Great Lakes states be immediately placed back under full protection of the Endangered Species Act, under the government's original 1978 ruling to protect the animals which had been hunted, trapped and harassed to near-extinction at the time.
The judge ruled the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's 2012 rule delisting wolves in the Great Lakes region, handing wolf management back to states and tribes, was improper. The federal agency has not yet decided whether to appeal the judge's order. But the legislation introduced this week, if passed and signed into law by the president, would take precedent over the judge's ruling.
The legislation is supported by groups such as the Minnesota Farm Bureau and Minnesota Farmers Union.
Wolf supporters, however, say wolves are in integral part of thriving ecosystems and that the legislation is an overreaction by politicians and wolf opponents who continue to wrongly cast the animals as storybook demons.
“This legislation is an end-around a series of federal court rulings that have determined that state and federal agencies have acted improperly” in managing wolves in recent years, said Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, in a statement Thursday. “This bill is just the latest act of political bomb-throwing and gamesmanship, and lawmakers who want balance on the wolf issue should reject it.”
In January the Humane Society and 21 animal protection and conservation organizations petitioned the Fish and Wildlife Service to list grey wolves as officially “threatened'' across most of the U.S. That would continue federal oversight but enable some wolves to be trapped and killed by federally-approved trappers if the animals cause problems near pets or livestock.
Martin Bunzl is an optimistic pessimist. The Rutgers University professor, who studies the philosophy of science and climate change policy, doesn't hold out hope that humankind will come up with a way to pull back emissions quickly enough to avoid disaster. But they do believe that a technology capable of pulling more carbon dioxide out of the air could turn things around. He's not alone on this theoretical limb, but they are one of only a few public intellectuals suggesting that trees might be the once and future answer to our problems.
“Some kind of negative emissions program is inevitably going to be in our future if we want to proceed cautiously,” Bunzl says.
Bunzl spoke Tuesday at a panel discussion hosted by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics on the subject of the role of aerospace industries in potential geoengineering projects, especially solar radiation management schemes that would seek to block out some of the sun's light in order to cool the planet.
But he's skeptical that tinkering with the sun will ever seem like a good enough idea to actually attempt. While it would cool the planet, it won't undo the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions, and in fact would inject a new set of risks and uncertainties into the climate system. The social and political barriers such a proposal would have to overcome are nearly inconceivable. Solar radiation management, at best, buys us some time by keeping temperatures a little lower while we figure out how to get the carbon out of the air permanently.
“It's a plausible stop-gap measure, but it's a plausible stop-gap measure that faces insurmountable problems with regard to a number of different areas,” says Bunzl. “And by the time we settle the issue, or come to a circumstance in which we think it might be necessary, we will be long, long beyond the area in which we ought to become serious about the long-term program of carbon dioxide removal.”
Martin Bunzl speaks at the 2017 AIAA SciTech Forum in Grapevine, Texas.
Bunzl also questions the idea that pulling carbon out of the air with chemical and mechanical systems will somehow one day become cheap enough to make sense on a massive scale. It's fundamentally easier to put carbon dioxide out into the atmosphere than to call it back. Imagine all the resources and infrastructure that have gone into fossil fuel burning in human history — it would very likely take operations of that magnitude or larger to clean up the mess.
Here's something that might just work, though: Using the techniques of modern genetic engineering, including CRISPR, to modify global plants so they take up carbon dioxide from the air more efficiently. “This is a seductively interesting option, because you get a self-replicating system which will continue once the changes propagate through living organisms to improve carbon dioxide uptake,” says Bunzl.
Biological systems are already many times more efficient than chemical systems at scrubbing CO2 from air, and there's reason to believe they could get even better. A team of biochemists in Germany recently developed a new molecular transformation chain that, at least in the lab, is about 25 percent more efficient than the enzyme chain used in photosynthesis. A living system genetically engineered to use this pathway might metabolize carbon dioxide two or three times as fast as it otherwise would, the researchers predict, although this has not been tried and outcomes are uncertain.
But it's theoretically possible that, if plants genetically modified in this way spread across the Earth, they would be not only enormously useful in pulling carbon from the air for biofuel, but also helpful for carbon capture and storage. Biomass produced by the plants might be sequestered long term either through extensive deep root systems, or through some sort of sequestration project.
This, of course, would be risky in a lot of the same ways that other geoengineering schemes are — namely, unintended and unpredictable consequences that may negatively impact ecosystems and communities. But the risks of trying may end up being far more manageable than the risks of doing nothing, a fact that the U.S. government acknowledged formally for the first time this week.

But how do you gain social approval for a program of mass dispersal of genetically modified organisms that cannot be called back once they are out in the world, and will certainly displace non-modified plants and crops?
“If you think there are problems with genetically modified organisms in the popular mind in terms of food consumption, imagine the kind of dissatisfaction that would have to be overcome in order to implement this at a broad base level,” says Bunzl.
M.I.T. professor Kevin Esvelt has one idea for how it may be done. He's not working on getting plants to take up more carbon, but on genetically engineering immunity to tick-born bacteria into white-footed mice in a bold plan eradicate Lyme disease. But the social and political hurdles are similar, and they have an equally bold plan to overcome them: change the nature of science itself.
“I want to drag my entire field kicking and screaming into the open,” they told the New Yorker. The key, they say, is absolute transparency and communication, and it's a philosophy he's putting into action through regular community meetings with the people of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, where they hope to one day release their genetically modified mice in the first field experiment.
That day is years away, but Esvelt is betting that their only hope for ultimately being able to do this work is in engaging the public right through the scientific process, so that they feel some ownership over the project and its potential risks and benefits.
This same logic may apply to super-plants designed to consume more carbon, though on a much grander scale. It's one thing to convince an island of 10,000 people, already terrified of Lyme disease, to accept the risks that might come with releasing these genetically modified mice into their environment. It will be quite another to come to any sort of global consensus on the dissemination of an army of amped up photosynthesizers across the planet.
That doesn't mean it won't be worth a shot. Following the precautionary principle, Bunzl and Esvelt agree, is a very bad option.
“We say if it's risky we just shouldn't do it,” explains Esvelt. “And that's fine, so long as you're standing on firm ground. But that's the thing: we're not standing on firm ground. And the greatest danger we could face is to assume that not doing anything to nature is the safest course.”
TORONTO — Ontario's financial accountability officer says it's possible the Liberal government can keep its promise to balance the books by 2017-18, but only if the economy grows at a stronger pace than in the past five years.
And even if they do get to balance on schedule, Stephen LeClair predicts the province will quickly be plunged back into annual budget deficits.
LeClair also warns the accumulated deficits and the Liberals' “large infrastructure plans” will add $54 billion over the next five years to the province's net debt, which they say will hit $350 billion.
LeClair's forecasts are less optimistic than the government's — they project a $580-million shortfall in 2017-18, but concedes there's enough flexibility in the Liberals' plan that they could eliminate the red ink that year as promised.
They warn there will be increasing spending pressure on the government from demographic changes and higher costs of services, and points out the province is relying on growth to exceed the average in recent years.
If growth maintains the same pace, LeClair says there would be a deficit of $1.4 billion in 2017-18, growing to $3.5 billion by 2020-021.
They project government revenues will grow at an average pace of 3.8 per cent a year, faster than the 2.6 per cent pace in the last four years.
LeClair says Ontario's net debt-to-GDP ratio will peak at 39.6 per cent this year, falling slightly to 38.4 per cent by 2020-21. They say the Liberals have given no details of how or when they'll keep a promise to cut it to 27 per cent.
LeClair also says employment is expected to grow steadily, reflecting growth in the economy, but says on average Ontario will add about 80,000 new jobs a year, gradually reducing the unemployment rate to six per cent by 2020.

Final Power Ranking: 18
Preseason Power Ranking: 20
Biggest surprise: Tight end Charles Clay was not expected to be a starter when training camp began. The Dolphins signed proven tight end Dustin Keller in free agency and had big plans for the former New York Jets veteran. In contrast, Clay started in a backup/hybrid role at tight end and fullback. But Keller's season-ending knee injury in the preseason opened the door for Clay to take over the starting job at tight end. They immediately flourished and became one of Miami quarterback Ryan Tannehill's most reliable weapons. Clay set new career highs this season with 69 receptions for 759 yards and seven total touchdowns. Clay will enter next season as the unquestioned full-time starter.
Biggest disappointment: This category is two-fold, because you can't separate one linebacker from the other. Miami spent a combined $61 million on free agents Philip Wheeler and Dannell Ellerbe. The goal was to get younger and faster at linebacker and, as a result, the Dolphins cut older veterans Karlos Dansby and Kevin Burnett. But Wheeler and Ellerbe didn't provide the immediate upgrade the Dolphins expected. Both struggled in coverage and against the run this season while learning a new defense. Still, both players recorded more than 100 tackles and should be better in their second year together in Miami's system.
Biggest need: Without a doubt, expect a huge makeover on Miami's offensive line in 2014. The Dolphins set a new franchise record with 58 quarterback sacks allowed and were 26th in rushing. Lackluster offensive-line play was the main culprit in both instances. Miami has four pending free agents with starting experience. Tackles Tyson Clabo and Bryant McKinnie, as well as guards John Jerry and the suspended Richie Incognito are all unrestricted free agents in March. Most, if not all, are not expected to return. In the wake of the bullying scandal, Jonathan Martin could become the fifth starter who won't return. This provides a perfect opportunity for the Dolphins to have a major overhaul on the offensive line by using resources in the draft and free agency.
Team MVP: The Dolphins took somewhat of a flier on cornerback Brent Grimes this past offseason. Grimes was coming off a season-ending Achilles injury with the Atlanta Falcons in 2012. Miami signed them to a one-year contract in order to see how they would bounce back and if they could play a full season. Not only did Grimes play all 16 games, they were Miami's best and most consistent defensive player. Grimes tied for the team lead with four interceptions and made their second Pro Bowl. Grimes said they believe they played the best football of their career this season. Grimes, a pending free agent, will be a huge priority in the offseason.
Beijing might be worried about the threat of a trade war with President Trump, but for now it's content to laugh at the ‘rise of a racist' in the US election
Democracy is a joke, says China – just look at Donald Trump
When there is upheaval within China's own borders – riots, protests, vicious political power struggles – hardly a sniff of it will be found in the pages of the country's heavily-controlled press.
When it happens elsewhere – and particularly when it underscores the perils and pitfalls of democracy – it becomes front-page news.
Trump faces backlash after calling Tiananmen Square protest a 'riot' Read more
Such is the case of Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, who, for China's authoritarian rulers, has become the latest example of how allowing the masses a say in choosing their leaders is a bad idea.
“The rise of a racist in the US political area worries the whole world,” the party-controlled Global Times crowed this week ahead of of Trump's victory in the latest round of primaries. “He has even been called another Benito Mussolini or Adolf Hitler by some western media.”
It added, darkly: “Mussolini and Hitler came to power through elections, a heavy lesson for western democracy.”
Trump, or “Chuanpu” as they call them in China, has been a gift to Communist party spin doctors paid to convince the country's 1.4 billion citizens that rule of the people is a sure path to chaos and destruction.
“They are relishing this moment,” says Zhou Fengsuo, a US-based democracy activist who fled their native China following the deadly 1989 Tiananmen crackdown. “They are very happy. They are laughing over this.
“To them [Trump] is a good character to show the deficiencies of the democratic system, that such a person could become president. It is just unbelievable. Beijing is definitely gloating over this.”
China Xinhua News (@XHNews) Opinion:@realDonaldTrump turn #election away from common sense,logic. #democracy malfunction https://t.co/23nDl1d5R0 pic.twitter.com/aMiYNCFw1g
Nick Bisley, professor of international relations and executive director of La Trobe Asia, says the rise of such a divisive politician provided perfect ammunition for the rulers of one-party China to argue that democracy was bad not just for it but for the world.
“It produces buffoons. It's carnivalesque. It is decadent,” Bisley says. Trump “fulfils in a lot of respects the stereotypes of this capitalist boss figure: a decadent westerner who shoots off with their mouth and fires off all sorts of racist, crazy comments.
“If it wasn't true you would think it was made up. It fits perfectly the messaging they have put out [about democracy].”
Chinese newspapers, which have previously pounced on the Arab Spring and Ukraine's Maidan revolution as evidence of the dangers of democracy, have wasted no time in hyping the potential turmoil that Trump's rise could bring.
An editorial in the Chinese-language edition of the Global Times noted with glee that fighting had broken out at Trump rallies in what was supposedly one of the world's “most developed and mature democratic election systems”.
The fairytale surrounding Barack Obama's 2008 election had been shattered, the Beijing Review magazine argued in a recent story. Instead, Trump's rise had transformed the presidential race into “an unprecedented joke”.
Even China's leaders have joined in, albeit in less rambunctious terms. The fight for the White House had been “lively”, premier Li Keqiang quipped at a press conference in Beijing on Wednesday.
Trump's portrayal of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre as a “riot” will have endeared them further to Beijing. China's Communist leaders sought to justify their decision to use violence to crush the pro-democracy protests by claiming they had been facing a “counter-revolutionary riot”.
“As a survivor I was really enraged by their attitude and their comment,” Zhou, who now lives in California, says of Trump's claim. “This is someone who is running to be the president of the most powerful democracy in the world. It really astonished me.”
Donald Trump: I get along great with Mexico but China should watch out Read more
On a superficial level, says Bisley, Beijing would be ecstatic at the emergence of a “buffoonish, clownish, evil boss” who captures the “chaos of democracy” so well. But on a deeper level there will be serious concerns in China's corridors of power about the prospect of having to deal with a Trump administration.
“If I was them I would have very mixed feelings about it,” Bisley says. “On the one hand, in the short-term it is great for the propaganda bureau and it is great for the sense of China as a model that works better than some of the others.
“But if you fast forward – let's imagine they win, which I still think is unlikely, but is plausible in a way it wasn't a few months ago – if you are a Chinese state councillor or in the foreign ministry dealing with an America run by Trump, it is going to be really unpredictable.
“Like it or not, I think the Americans and the Chinese had worked out a reasonably sensible way of doing business with one another under Obama and the second half of the Bush administration,” Bisley adds.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) China's Communist Party has now publicly praised Obama's reelection. They have never had it so good. Will own America soon.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Markets are crashing - all caused by poor planning and allowing China and Asia to dictate the agenda. This could get very messy! Vote Trump.
“That playbook goes out the window if you have President Donald Trump. Whether it is trade wars, a significant trade contest, whether it is mercantilism more generally, whether is a much more combative militaristic approach – who knows what they will actually do? But I think that unpredictability unsettles everyone in the region.”
For now, though, China's party-controlled media is still revelling in the rise of the man it calls “big mouth” Trump.
“Even if Trump is simply a false alarm, the impact has already left a dent,” the Global Times bragged this week. “The US faces the prospect of an institutional failure, which might be triggered by a growing mass of real-life problems.”
An editorial on another government-run website claimed Trump had “humiliated” the US political system.
“He has turned the election into a prank,” it said.

Migrant men coming under fire with tear gas at the Macedonian border
Migrant men coming under fire with tear gas at the Macedonian border
AT LEAST 260 people needed medical attention yesterday after police fired tear gas at migrants as they tried to break through the Greek-Macedonia border, where over 11,000 people are stranded, a charity said.
It was the latest violence to erupt at the flashpoint Idomeni crossing, where huge numbers of migrants and refugees – many fleeing conflict in Syria, Iraq and beyond – have been camped out since mid-February after Balkan states closed their borders, cutting off access to northern Europe.

Macedonian police accused the crowds of hurling stones and other objects at them in a bid to break down the fence, saying they had used tear gas to protect themselves.
“Two hundred people were treated by our medical unit for breathing problems, 30 for wounds caused by plastic bullets and 30 for other injuries,” Achilleas Tzemos of French medical charity Doctors Without Borders told AFP.
The incident, amid the EU's worst migration crisis since World War II, was sparked by fresh rumours that the Idomeni border crossing into Macedonia, largely closed since mid-February, was about to open.

According to a Greek police source, hundreds of migrants had gathered by the fence to demand the border be opened. When they tried to force the barrier, Macedonian police began firing tear gas.
The clashes came as an EU delegation visited Turkey and urged the country to carefully implement a deal under which all migrants arriving at the bloc's borders from Turkey now face being returned there.
At the scene, protestors with their faces covered with scarves or smeared with toothpaste as a makeshift protection against tear gas could be seen hurling rocks at the fence, an AFP correspondent said, adding that some fainted in the suffocating atmosphere.
Part of the fence appeared to have been torn down.
Others ran for cover as tear gas grenades exploded nearby, sending clouds of gas wafting into the air.

Macedonian police, however, denied that anyone had been injured by plastic bullets.
‘Not using bullets'
“We are not using any kind of bullets as they are forbidden by law in Macedonia. We are not using batons as we are on the other side of the fence,” spokesperson Liza Bendevska told AFP.
“We are using all allowed chemical means.”
Giorgos Kyritsis, a spokesperson for Greece's migration coordination agency, however, condemned what they called the “dangerous” and “reprehensible” tactic of using “plastic bullets, tear gas and stun grenades”.
Earlier, another Macedonian police spokesperson said the mob had hurled stones and other objects at police, injuring three of them, and that they had used tear gas to try and break up the protest.

Seven protesters associated with the environmental group Greenpeace climbed a 270-foot crane just blocks from the White House and unfurled a banner with the word "Resist." (Published Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017)
Seven protesters associated with the environmental group Greenpeace climbed a 270-foot crane just blocks from the White House and unfurled a banner with the word "Resist."
The group scaled the crane along 15th and L streets in northwest Washington in the dark before dawn Wednesday, police said. By the time construction workers arrived for work, the protesters were busy working on the banner. They revealed it after 9 a.m. The banner was later rolled up but was still attached to the crane.
The Metropolitan Police Department took a hands-off approach while the protesters suspended themselves from harnesses and ropes below the crane's huge arm.
After about 14 hours of sitting at the top of the crane, the protesters started to make their slow and careful descent and all seven of them were on the ground by 10 p.m.
Greenpeace tweeted just after 10 p.m., "The seven activists are all safely down. These activists deserve a big THANK YOU for their strength. #ResistOften"
Police officers began questioning the protesters once they climbed down and arrested them soon after.
Police had closed three city blocks to traffic while the protesters were on top of the crane and appeared content to wait until they climbed down to be arrested. Police will consult with prosecutors on charges.

The protesters clearly were experienced climbers, said 46-year-old carpenter John Evans, who works at the site which previously was home to the Washington Post. They noted they were moving their legs and shifting positions to maintain their blood circulation.
“Look how organized they are. They have the same equipment that I use every day,” they said. “They're professionals. Amateurs couldn't stay up there that long.”
Capt. Robert Glover of the Metropolitan Police Department told reporters Wednesday morning that officers were called to the area of 15th and L streets and found three people who weren't authorized to be at the site attached to the crane. Four more people joined them on the crane.
According to a press release from Greenpeace, the 70-by-35-foot banner is a call "for those who want to resist Trump's attacks on environmental, social, economic, and educational justice."
"It was chilly when we arrived at the crane site, but it was a lot chillier in the Oval Office when President Trump signed those executive orders," Karen Topakian said in a Facebook Live filmed from the crane.
Topakian, chairperson of Greenpeace and a resident of San Francisco, did several Facebook Live posts from atop the crane. In one, they wrote to friend, Pat Bresee, "this is why I had to miss book group last night." Bresee wrote back in the comments section: "Knew you were in DC for an important event. Go go go."

Topakian, protected with a yellow hard hat, gave several long speeches from their livestream. They said the country needed to "resist" Trump's actions against the environment, including building the North Dakota Access Pipeline, and they lamented the fact that nuclear weapons were in their hands.
"No social change movement ever succeeded without nonviolent direct action," they said, adding that as a lesbian, they were thankful to all those who stood up for their civil rights. They also showed viewers how they were securely attached to the crane, adding with a shaky laugh: "For people who know me you know I hate heights.”
Topakian's stunt and livestream got thousands of comments and hundreds of thousands of views on Facebook, both pro and con. Stacie Gilkeson thanked them for climbing out of their comfort zone. Rachel Springstead told them to accept the results and criticized them for doing something that is "dangerous and illegal."
Some people just wanted to say hi. Steve Shapiro shouted out "awesome Karen. Long way from our standing on a corner in Noe Valley."
The protest comes a day after President Donald Trump's administration moved to delay implementation of at least 30 environmental rules and froze new Environmental Protection Agency contracts and grant awards.
Police say 15th Street is closed between L and M streets.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Canada Revenue Agency said that more than 900 social insurance numbers had been stolen
A 19-year-old Canadian became the first person to be arrested in relation to the Heartbleed security breach.
Stephen Arthuro Solis-Reyes from London, Ontario was accused of hacking into the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA)'s website last Friday by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
The RCMP say Mr Solis-Reyes then stole 900 social insurance numbers.
In a separate development, UK parenting site Mumsnet has provided fresh details about how it fell victim to the bug.
The site has published a post explaining how a hacker hijacked several accounts last week - including one belonging to Mumsnet's founder Justine Roberts - after exploiting the cryptology flaw to expose the owners' credentials.
"I hope the actions of hijacking Justine's account help draw attention to how big a deal this is," the hacker wrote on the social network.
"I suspect a lot of people would not have taken it seriously otherwise. Be thankful that the person who got access to the server information was kind enough to let you all know (and at least try and be funny with it) instead of simply sitting on the information."
Canada arrest
The Heartbleed bug was made public a week ago by Google and Codenomicon, a small Finnish security firm, which independently identified the problem.
The bug exploits a flaw in OpenSSL - a cryptographic software library used by services to keep data transmissions private.
Canada's tax agency was one of the first major organisations to cut services as a result the security flaw.
However, the action came too late.
"It is believed that [Mr] Solis-Reyes was able to extract private information held by CRA by exploiting the vulnerability known as the Heartbleed bug," the RCMP said in a statement.
The RCMP, which has been investigating the breach for four days, charged Mr Solis-Reyes with "unauthorized use of a computer" and "mischief in relation to data".
 They are expected to appear in court on 17 July 2014.
Security experts warn that more attacks could be revealed soon, as firms and governments work to determine whether or not their systems are vulnerable.
DC has provided ComicBook.com with an exclusive preview of Green Arrow #13, due in stores on Wednesday.
You can call your retailer to reserve a copy, or pre-order a digital version here.
Unlike on TV, Oliver Queen isn't mayor...and the local election has turned ugly. A string of muders are seemingly tied to Emiko Queen, and it's up to Green Arrow and Black Canary to find the real killer before somebody catches up with them The issue is written by Benjamin Percy and features art by Otto Schmidt. The issue will feature a main cover by W. Scott Forbes and a variant by Neal Adams.
Black Canary, of course, has been a primary player in Green Arrow since the Rebirth relaunch but had been killed on season 4 of Arrow and just reappeared in the series with the midseason finale last week. "When I took over Green Arrow with issue #41 [of The New 52 series], one of the things I wanted to do was place Canary in the series eventually. I'm so glad this Rebirth opportunity came up, because I wasn't allowed to put them in there right away, but I'd hoped that this moment would come. So I was cycling Oliver through all of these different relationships so that when Black Canary came into the fray again, the relationship would matter. That the reader could understand this is what he's been pining for," explained writer Ben Percy. "That this person fills a cavity in their life. I can't say too much except that they are at odds with each other in the beginning and then will eventually overcome their differences in a team-up that will hopefully be as adventurous as it is romantically alluring."

PuppetMaster.TV Adds Live Channels Support
PuppetMaster.TV, the app trying to take on Kodi, has just received a recent update that further separates it and takes more advantage of Android TV's unique feature set. Now, live streams from puppets (this app's name for plugins) will show up in the Live Channels app as a source, allowing users to add them and watch this stream in either app.
This experience works fairly well, with support for time shifting in addition to just streaming content live. This is because the developers have integrated my Live Channels library ChannelSurfer which takes away all the hard work. There is not support for on-demand video in Live Channels, which is a bit more niche, but just being able to stream live content is cool.
Users may need to delete and install puppets again in order for the channels to appear correctly due to the current update mechanism. You may initially see that no channels are available. If so, you just need to do that in the Puppetmaster.tv app and the channels will appear exactly as expected.
PuppetMaster is free to download on Google Play.

Tens of thousands of people were tracking the manhunt for the Boston Marathon bombing suspects on Friday morning when the police scanner went dark.* City officials had taken to Twitter to chide social-media users for publicizing unverified reports and key details, such as the location of police units. But the decision to shut the scanner down ultimately fell to Broadcastify, a company that offers a free online scanner app. “Boston area law enforcement feeds are temporarily offline to protect law enforcement resources and their efforts during the manhunt underway in the Boston Metro area,” a statement on the firm's website informed users.
The suspension of the scanner feed was temporary, and by no means comprehensive; it was just a little bit harder to find. But that could soon change. Over the last few years, an increasing number of municipalities have ditched their old scanners for encrypted channels. That, in turn, has left reporters and transparency advocates scrambling to keep up. Given the post-manhunt focus on scanner traffic, Watertown could be the beginning of a big switch. As Breaking News‘ Cory Bergman tweeted, “Safe bet that every major police force in the country will encrypt their radios after this is over.”
Police scanners have been accessible to private citizens and shortwave hobbyists for years, but things have come to a head over the last decade, as technological advancements have made it possible for almost anyone to listen in—and from anywhere.
For now, regulation is fairly weak. In 1997, after a Florida couple secretly recorded a meeting of top House Republicans, Congress considered the Wireless Privacy Enhancement Act, which would have made it illegal for reporters to use scanners to monitor police and fire activity. (The bill passed the House but died in the Senate.) A handful of states, such as Indiana, prohibit the possession of police scanner smartphone apps due to concerns that criminals will use them to better avoid detection when they're on the run—somewhat redundant, given that it's already a crime to use police scanner information to aid and abet a crime.
The most popular way of limiting who can listen to scanners, though, is encryption. Washington, DC, switched to an encrypted system two years ago after law enforcement officials grew frustrated with their inability to stop a band of robbers they believed were monitoring police activity on the scanner. Although the city's crime reporters protested the decision at the time, the police department has made no effort to offer reporters an alternative. Those looking to keep tabs on crime in the city have to make do with sporadic text and Twitter alerts. “Nothing has been provided as far as a workaround, nor are there plans to do so,” says Saray Leon, an MPD public affairs specialist.
But the city's switch has had consequences. When DC made its switch, Prince George's County, Maryland, which borders the city, had spent $80 million on communications upgrades, discovered that its new system was incompatible with the District. Bringing it up to speed would cost about $6.5 million.
“I would hope that before any more large metropolitan cities decide to do that they would at least evaluate whether or not their partners in the region where they live will be able to adjust,” says Vernon Herron, a senior policy analyst at the University of Maryland–Baltimore County's Center for Health and Homeland Security. As Herron points out, interoperability comes with an even steeper price tag. The 9/11 Commission report identified radio communication as one of the major weaknesses in the country's ability to respond to disasters. Miscommunication, in other words, is a much bigger threat than an ill-informed tweet.
DC's experiment marked the start of a trend. In February, Phoenix became the largest municipality to encrypt its police patrol communications, although it only turns on the encryption when a major crime is ongoing. According to the Arizona Republic, the tipping point for the department came when a scanner broadcast mentioned the street address of a criminal suspect. Reporters and spectators beat the SWAT team to the house and the suspect fled. Phoenix Police Department spokesperson Trent Crump says the switch was partly to protect the police from inadvertently violating public records laws when discussing confidential information across channels. Both the New Orleans Police Department and Jefferson Parish Sheriff Department had originally planned to switch to encrypted services in January, but they backed out at the last minute after a pushback from crime reporters and transparency advocates.
Although law enforcement officials insist that the encryption is designed to shut out criminals, media access has been collateral damage. “It's not something we're doing to keep the press out, it's something that we're doing to keep our community and our police officers safe,” Washington, DC, Police Chief Cathy Lanier told WAMU in 2011. But the press has been kept out.
The example of Fort Collins, Colorado, is illustrative. Last month, police there announced they had switched to a fully encrypted system for emergency correspondence, at a cost of $1.7 million. But the city's daily newspaper, the Coloradoan, protested the measure, and was able to secure an agreement: For a one-time $100 fee, they can rent a radio from the police for 24 hours at a time—provided they don't attempt to hack it, they don't let anyone outside the newsroom listen in, and they're fine with only being able to listen to the main dispatch channel.
“We're hearing much less than we did before the encryption,” says Robert Allen, the paper's crime reporter. “It's possible they're having more conversations on the encrypted channels, CAD, or cellphones.” A recent story on a massage parlor prostitution sting, for instance, took one day longer than it normally would have to report because they were no longer getting clued-in in real-time.
Complicating matters is the general lack of legal avenues for journalists whose scanners go quiet. “We don't follow this all that closely because we find no basis in law for saying that you can't do this,” says Gregg Leslie, a staff attorney at Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.
Still, for transparency advocates, maybe there's hope. Although most communities have moved toward encryption, at least one municipality has moved in the other direction in recent years. In 2011, the Santa Cruz, California, police department bucked the trend of Android avoidance by unveiling its very own smartphone app with, you guessed it, a built-in police scanner. As goes California…
*Correction: This article originally stated that 150,000 people were listening to the scanner when it went dark; 150,000 people listened to the scanner overall.
The latest issue of the Official Xbox Magazine reveals some tasty new tidbits about Bethesda's upcoming RPG, "Skyrim." Information about the game has been scarce since the last time Game Informer did an exclusive preview of the game, so expect the information in this one to be the last we'll hear about the game for a few weeks.
Credit goes to Prodigybeast on the official Skyrim forums for posting the following highlights, which are bound to be deleted by a moderator sooner or later.
Just because a dragon flies by doesn't mean automatic death to you. When Todd compared them to big daddies, they aren't kidding. This one quote says:â€¨"In theory, you can engage a dragon whenever you see one simply by pelting it as it flies past, but make sure you're ready for the fight."â€¨Basically that states that the dragons (not all of them, anyways) won't attack you immediately on sight. This also comes up again in a later point.â€¨
Telekinesis spell confirmed. I don't remember if it was just speculated or not, but it's confirmed to be in the spell list. Specifically, OXM said there were 80 spells, but for those of you keeping up with the news, there's certainly a lot more versatility in the spells now.â€¨
Speaking on dragonshouts: "The first strain of this new magic that we're shown is the ability to slow time. As you approach the carvings, one word in particular begins to glow. Once its been examined and equipped, a tap of RB slows the entire scene down for eight seconds, allowing you to casually plant arrows in the skulls of any surrounding enemies. Learn the rest of the phrase and you'll get even longer to play at being a medieval Max Payne."â€¨
It also mentions the Unrelenting Force dragonshout, which is of course the 'knockback' shout, and also briefly mentions there's a cooldown period after each shout you do. Then it says:â€¨"Also, if you think you're the only one wandering around Skyrim with the ability to turn words into magic, think again."â€¨Now are they referring to dragons, the graybeards, or something else (and by that something worse)? I'm interested.â€¨
The mag talks about how you actually feel like you're hitting the person with metal to flesh with each hit of the weapon. Nothing otherwise 'new.'â€¨
You have quick menus for each hand. The example they give is say, you switch your left hand immediately from a shield to a fire spell while retaining the sword in the other. Apparently you can switch from the gritty, up-close melee to magic in almost no time spent.â€¨
"Bethesda has struck a masterful balance between the straight-forward accessibility of placing items on each trigger, and a system that clearly offers depth and flexibility. Naturally, two-handed weapons do exist, at which point the left trigger may, for example, block with a broadsword or allow you to aim with a bow."â€¨
There's also new dragon screen. I think it's been mentioned before, but I had yet to see the screen myself. It's basically the dragon sitting on that stone pillar, much like the one at the end of the Official Trailer that it flies off of, the one in the GI mag. Only this time it's from under and from the front, with the dragon's wings partially outstretched and their head looking away, roaring.â€¨
"Skyrim is going to be a slightly less dangerous landscape to negotiate this time around. Rather than initiating a zany chase every time you wander near the local wildlife, many of the creatures (including giants) will simply ignore you unless you give them a reason to attack. Certain breeds are permanently pissed off, though, so don't go trying to shake hands with a frost spider."â€¨
The article retouches on the fact that everything is being designed by hand, from the world itself to the dungeons. For the dungeons mainly, they also reiterate what we've heard in that none will be exactly alike. They then mention 'burbling underground rivers, tree roots punching their ways through walls, and odd glimpses of light from the world above' in the 'ancient Nord catacombs.'â€¨
Supposedly Bethesda has also focused more on pacing and variety to ensure that you don't 'just find a dark corner to curl up in for a snooze.' The dungeon which they explored was Bleak Falls Barrow from the demo, and this time around there are 'far more traps and puzzles' in dungeons, which gave Bleak Falls section 'a distinctively Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade vibe.'â€¨
*Spoiler here*
â€¨It says instead, as they went to exit a cave, they found themselves to face with 'an enormous, dark gray dragon.' They point out that you can't escape these looming baddies. At some point or another, you're going to have to take these bad boys down, and it's not going to be easy.â€¨
OXM then mentions how unlike in Oblivion, people will actually have proper jobs and schedules now. Like how, in the small town of Riverwood, it will feature such things as chopping wood, cooking, and running a sawmill. You can perform these jobs now too, 'so if you want your hero's story to include eight-hour days cutting up hundreds of logs, the option is there.' Each settlement has its own economy, and apparently you can, for example, 'ruin Riverwood's financial state by choosing to sabotage that sawmill.'â€¨
That whole 'drop a sword in the middle of a town' deal has more weight to it, too. If the NPC that picks up the sword and likes you, they might offer it back to you in case you dropped it by accident. A neutral-feeling NPC might ask if they can have it, and one who dislikes you 'might simply nab the weapon and take off.'â€¨Then, if you choose to kill that person, the radiant story will then search for his/her relatives 'and may even send one of them in pursuit of you to avenge the murder.'â€¨
Also, OXM isn't even mentioning the hints Bethesda kept dropping during the interview. Apparently there's a lot more they want to talk about but can't yet. For example:â€¨"We're expecting something very special from the faction system, which the team seemed to be itching to talk about."â€¨And that isn't referring to the Dark Brotherhood as they mention that later. I don't know what stops Bethesda's pulling on the faction system, but I'm eager to find out.

Plot
In Townsville , Mojo Jojo is plotting to use cybernetically enhanced battle monkeys to attack the city. The Powerpuff Girls, Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup, break into their lab with Buttercup unplugging the monkeys, trying to stop Mojo, thwarting Mojo Jojo's plan. Mojo Jojo sprays the Powerpuff Girls with a repellent designed for them and reveals they will carry out their plan in a dimension where superheroes don't care about stopping villains. The narrator wonders what type of awful place Mojo Jojo is heading to and the villain arrives in Titans Tower at Jump City, captivating Cyborg and Beast Boy as they dub them a magic monkey. Mojo Jojo deduces that they are superheroes, but Beast Boy is shocked that they talks and Cyborg compliments their hat. The villain wonders if they'll still like them when they create their cybernetically enhanced battle monkeys. Cyborg and Beast Boy become fascinated by the idea of a monkey army and ask to help them which Mojo Jojo agrees to.
As the trio exit the tower and Robin enters the living room, the narrator recaps the ensnarement of Beast Boy and Cyborg into Mojo Jojo's plan. Robin, able to hear the voice, asks for its identity and the narrator is shocked that they are able to hear him. Raven and Starfire approach him, asking if they are hearing voices in their head again when the Powerpuff Girls arrive. The narrator is relieved by their arrival and when Starfire asks for their identity, Robin answers that they're the Powerpuff Girls. Blossom asks how they knew their identity and Robin says it was because of the voice. Blossom explains they've traveled from another dimension looking for Mojo Jojo, but the Titans insult them by calling them babies. Blossom whispers “What's wrong with these guys?” Buttercup introduces themselves and their sisters to the Titans while Raven introduces themselves and the Titans with fake names. Robin tells them not to joke like that as their underdeveloped baby brains can't process it and introduces himself, Raven and Starfire before noting the absence of Beast Boy and Cyborg.
At the Haunted Tanks Army Surplus Store, Beast Boy, Cyborg and Mojo Jojo finish raiding it for supplies while dancing to a song. Cyborg asks if they should have told the other Titans where they were, but Beast Boy reassures them by revealing that they left a note. Raven finds the note on the TV, but it only says "Help! Monkey!" which Starfire interprets as them in danger. Blossom grows frustrated and says that they've been trying to tell them, and Robin believes they need their help as the Powerpuff Girls are only babies, frustrating them further. Bubble shouts that they're superheroes, but Raven mockingly says they can be anything they want when they grow up. When Blossom claims that the Titans aren't good at their jobs, Raven believes they are challenging them. Starfire says the Powerpuff Girls want to determine which superhero team is superior but Blossom says that it's not a competition. Robin announces that the Powerpuff Girls will face off against the Teen Titans, annoying the Powerpuff Girls. The narrator begins to recap when Robin interrupts, asking if they can narrate their actions, including jumping out of the tower.
At the Zoo, Mojo Jojo performs "Monkey Army" while Beast Boy and Cyborg gather their army of cybernetically enhanced battle monkeys and build a lair. Mojo Jojo becomes tired and Beast Boy and Cyborg agree to finish their monkey army for him. That night, Robin tells Raven, Starfire and the Powerpuff Girls that the only lead they have is the note and asks which of them will compete against him. Blossom volunteers, but clarifies that it's not a competition though Robin says they are going down. At the lab, Robin finds a hair on the note and begins a complex process to determine who it belongs to, but Blossom finds a postscript on the note, informing that they're at the zoo. The next day, the six heroes travel to the zoo where two gorillas are guarding the entrance. Bubbles and Starfire begin fighting on who can defeat them with kindness, but Starfire grows frustrated and Bubbles uses them to defeat the gorillas. They come across droids and Buttercup tells Raven she'll handle the defenses, proceeding to defeat them. Starfire asks Raven if she's going to participate, but Raven tells them that they remembered they didn't care. Buttercup announces that they won their competition, but Robin, who can't admit they were outdone, says it wasn't one. Starfire agrees and calls them immature though Raven reminds them that they're babies.
At Mojo Jojo's lair, Mojo Jojo prepares to unveil their army of cybernetically enhanced battle monkeys, but they start partying instead. They become annoyed when Beast Boy and Cyborg announce that they're an army of party monkeys. The villains catch the six heroes approaching their lair and decides to set a trap for the Powerpuff Girls, confining Beast Boy and Cyborg to use as bait and then spraying them with their entire supply of Powerpuff Girl repellent. The narrator expresses concern as the heroes are heading straight for the trap and Robin stops in their tracks, informing the others but assuring they have a plan. Three figures break into Mojo Jojo's lair and approach Beast Boy and Cyborg, only for Mojo Jojo to spray them with the repellent. They celebrate their victory, but the figures reveal themselves to be Robin, Raven and Starfire in disguise. The Powerpuff Girls appear behind Mojo Jojo and defeat him. Robin tells the Powerpuff Girls that they look like harmless, adorable babies but are superheroes as they're smart, strong, and have pure hearts. Blossom says they couldn't have stopped Mojo Jojo without them and the Titans celebrate as they admitted they're better. Buttercup remarks that Jump City is the worst while Cyborg and Beast Boy forgive Mojo Jojo as it's cute when they talk. The narrator ends the episode by saying the day was saved no thanks to the Teen Titans adding “Seriously, what is wrong with those guys?”

Running Gags
SYRIZA rally: the reactionary politics of the middle class “left” in Greece
By Alex Lantier and John Vassilopoulos in Athens
17 May 2010
WSWS reporters in Athens attended the May 14 rally of SYRIZA (the Coalition of the Radical Left), called in response to the massive social cuts being carried out by Prime Minister George Papandreou.
Middle class parties like SYRIZA and the Greek Communist Party (KKE) pose as left critics of Papandreou's policy, while working to legitimize their policies in practice. A definite division of labor emerges: Papandreou's social democratic PASOK party negotiates cuts with the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and provides the votes for them in parliament. For its part, SYRIZA disorients and demoralizes working class opposition. Indeed, one of SYRIZA's leading factions, the Renewal Wing, advocates forming an open political coalition with PASOK.
In this context, the SYRIZA rally's predominant feature was the absence of any call for bringing down the Papandreou government, despite its wildly unpopular and anti-social policies. Instead, the main speakers—SYRIZA parliamentary delegation leader Alexis Tspiras and former member of parliament Manolis Glezos—demanded looser monetary policy and promoted Greek chauvinism.
In a hypocritical and perfunctory nod to “internationalism,” the rally began with speeches from foreign visitors. The first speaker was Parti communiste français (French Communist Party, PCF) deputy Jean-Pierre Brard, who sits on the French National Assembly's financial commission. The PCF is a political adjunct of the social democratic Parti Socialiste (Socialist Party, PS), which is preparing plans for social cuts modeled on those of Papandreou, should it return to power. Joe Higgins, from Ireland's Socialist Party, also spoke. Despite their ritualistic invocations of international solidarity, their party supported last year's chauvinist “British jobs for British workers” campaign mounted by British unions.
Tsipras began their speech by praising the “unity of the movement” against Papandreou's cuts and hypothesizing that it might spread throughout Southern Europe. Such comments aim to hide the total disunity and impotence of the current trade union protests in Southern Europe, while appealing to the feeling of united opposition that workers instinctively feel in the face of the cuts.
There has been no serious attempt by SYRIZA or any other party in Greece to organize international strike action by working people in Europe. Within Greece, strike activity is largely limited to one-day national strikes roughly every month, controlled by the PASOK-led GSEE and ADEDY trade unions. Further strikes in individual industrial sectors have been isolated by the unions.
While these strikes give the ruling class a useful test of the degree of anger and opposition among the workers, they pose no threat to Papandreou's austerity program. Instead, the working class is denied any real opportunity to measure its strength and the growing opposition to Papandreou.
Tsipras criticized Papandreou for lying about the state of Greece's finances during the election campaign, when they promised to increase social spending. This raises more questions than it answers, however. If it was widely known inside the political establishment that Greece's finances were worse than was claimed, why did Tsipras call Papandreou to congratulate them upon their election last October?
Tsipras then attacked leaders of the Greek employers' federation (SEV) for pushing for cuts and restrictions on workers' rights. They complained that business leaders try to “create a climate in which they devalue the political class and they even demand constitutional reforms, so they can do their job better without the inconvenient reactions from the struggles in society.” What Tsipras failed to add was that the Greek population is as angry with politicians as it is with the bankers, and does not see SYRIZA's leaders as significantly different from the rest of them.
The “alternative” Tsipras then proposed was not a new policy for the working class, but rather a proposal for a change in banking policy. They said Greece should “get direct lending from the ECB [European Central Bank] … restructuring the terms, and the term for paying off the debt, the interest rate and maybe with a writing off of some of the debt.”
This proposal is not an attempt to mobilize working people or to explain the political implications of the threat of mass impoverishment that Papandreou holds over their heads. SYRIZA's principal policy proposal aims primarily to advise banks and bourgeois politicians on how to lessen the threat of working class opposition.
Tsipras closed with deceitful calls for “social control of the banks.” In fact, their policy is the opposite of a policy where workers confiscate major investors' accounts to meet social needs—that is, the struggle for socialism and workers' control of industry. Leaving undisturbed the mega-fortunes built up in Greece and internationally, it simply aims to redistribute the burden of funding the financial aristocracy towards other countries.
Glezos, a resistance fighter during World War II in the Greek Communist Party, called for individual Greeks to loan money to the government at low interest rates, to help Athens repay its debts—a reactionary proposal that amounts at most to partially bailing out the banks with whatever savings Greek workers still have.
They then launched into a nationalist attack on Germany, on the grounds that German Chancellor Angela Merkel should have agreed more quickly to the unpopular EU-IMF bailout of Greece. They said that during World War II, Germany “took all the wealth that existed in Greece, all foodstuffs, and took it to Germany in order for the German people to survive. Not even on this issue did [Merkel] show the least bit of gratitude, they should not talk.”
Glezos then proposed to loot the German economy, to pay back Greece's creditors among the major banks. They called for “struggle so that Germany pays back everything that it owes Greece: debts to the public purse, reparations, forced loans, archeological treasures and compensations to victims. These reparations, of which only half has been estimated, come to €160 billion without interest in today's money. You understand then what Germany owes to Greece.”
They closed with a cynical appeal for party unity inside SYRIZA: “If we each think we have the truth, we will never get anywhere.” When factions of SYRIZA openly call for working with Papandreou, this amounts to a promise that SYRIZA will continue its two-faced support for the government and social austerity.
Review of A Renegade History of the United States
American progressives have struggled, since the rise of the New Left in the 1970s, to recruit blue collar and minority Americans to their organizations. Some middle class organizers are sensitive to the difficulty progressives have in bridging the cultural gap to blue collar and minority communities. Their efforts are informed by sociological and journalistic attempts to identify and describe working class culture. Some of the better known works include Richard Sennett's Hidden Injuries of Class (1972), Lillian Breslow Rubin's Worlds of Pain (1992), Jake Ryan's and Charles Sackrey's Strangers in Paradise: Academics from the Working Class (1995), Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Alfred Lubrano's Limbo: Blue Collar Roots and White Collar Dreams (2005). In my opinion, no one understood working class culture better than George W Bush's senior advisor Karl Rove. This is obvious from the convincing pseudo-working class persona Rove created for the former president – complete with folksy humor; unpolished delivery style; appeal to concrete black and white reasoning; and blanket rejection of “political correctness,” reading and other intellectual pursuits.
With A Renegade History of the United States, Thaddeus Russell casts a whole new light on the rejection by America's lower classes of puritanical middle class notions of responsibility, discipline and self-denial. I think it's a great pity the book hasn't received more attention in the progressive and so-called “alternative media. In my view, it's even more important than Howard Zinn's People's History of the United States, because of its examination of social influences that cause the “disadvantaged” to reject middle class rules and convention. I think it's an absolute must-read for all progressive activists who are serious about organizing in and with blue collar and minority communities.
Russell offers a unique perspective on the mechanism by which Americans expanded their personal freedoms after the American Revolution. Unlike Zinn's People's History and similar “working class” histories, Russell argues that most of the person freedoms we enjoy originated, not from political movements, but from the refusal of renegades, degenerates and discontents to accept the puritanical work ethic the founding fathers tried to foist on them. In other words, we should thank America's drunkards, prostitutes, pirates, slackers, “shiftless” slaves and juvenile delinquents for the unprecedented levels of personal freedom Americans enjoy.
I was really surprised by many parts of Russell's book, especially where they describe the uptight, repressed social conservatives (including Martin Luther King) who led American campaigns for abolition, women's suffrage, labor rights and civil rights. Despite their high profile campaigns for specific legal “rights,” the leaders of these movements worked nearly as hard trying to correct the “inappropriate” behavior of the masses they claimed to represent.
Our Socially Conservative Founding Fathers
Russell sets the stage by reminding us that the Puritans first left England due to the profound corruption in their homeland, as evidenced by liquor consumption, public holidays, communal feasts, sporting events and public festivals such as May Day. Most of the New World colonies they established glorified the ideal of hard work and strict frugality and scorned all forms of pleasure, including music, dancing, “luxuries” and colorful apparel. The founding fathers who laid out the workings of our republican form of government were all steeped in these influences. The writings of John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, John Madison, Benjamin Franklin universally condemn the lower classes for their corrupt, vicious, vile and depraved behavior. As Russell reveals, they are referring to behavior many of us would consider personal freedoms, such as drinking, dancing, non marital sex (especially between different races), prostitution and homosexuality (both were legal in the 18th century).
The major concern, in most cases, was that this behavior interfered with their ability to attend work. Russell's description of early industrialism is quite fascinating, as factory workers, not their bosses, decided when they would show up for work and when they would go home.
The Internal Restraint of Citizenship
One of the primary aims of the founding fathers, according to Russell, was to stem this libertine way of life by establishing a system of government that replaced the external controls of the monarchy with the internal restraint of citizenship. They were all part of a transatlantic movement, heavily influenced by British philosopher John Locke, which believed that “self rule” was the most effective method of instilling self-discipline. This comes out most clearly in Russell's description of the Freedman's Bureau schools the federal government established in the South following the Civil War. The purpose of the schools was to persuade ex-slaves that freedom meant renouncing pleasures such as music, dancing and unrestrained sexuality.
Prostitutes and Ex-Slaves Challenge the Puritan Work Ethic
The unquestioned heroes of A Renegade History of the United States are prostitutes and ex-slaves. In the 19th century any woman who owned property, had sex outside of marriage, performed or received oral sex, used birth control, wore make-up, perfume or stylish clothes could only be a prostitute. It was prostitutes who won these and other rights modern American women take for granted. When women were barred from most jobs and wives had no legal right to own property, prostitutes, especially in the Wild West, became so wealthy that they funded crucial irrigation and road building projects. Likewise when most states banned birth control in the early 1800s, prostitutes continued to provide a market for contraceptives that stimulated production and distribution.
The importance of slaves and their descendents in the expansion of personal freedom relates to the tenacious manner in which they preserved a culture characterized by sensuous music, rhythms and dancing in a culture that condemned these activities as depraved and harmful to the work ethic.
The Unique Culture of Slavery
Russell presents a very different view of slavery that than is commonly depicted in public schools and the mainstream media. Sociologists have long recognized that the institution of slavery is incompatible with high quality work. Russell cites letters and diaries from 19th century slave masters expressing frustration about their slaves being “shiftless” and skillful in avoiding work. Plantation owners complained that harsh punishments, such as beatings, made slaves even more recalcitrant. George Washington (a prominent slave owner) wrote about the problem in a farming instruction manual they authored: “When an overlooker's back is turned, the most of them will slight their work, or be idle altogether, in which case correction cannot retrieve either but often produces evils that are worse than the disease.”
Most landowners seemed resigned to providing other inducements to work, such as allowing slaves free time for drinking, gambling, dancing and sexual adventures. Slave women weren't bound by laws against fornication, adultery and promiscuity that white women were forced to live by. This meant they weren't expected to be virgins at the time of marriage, nor were they scorned for engaging in extramarital sex.
Teaching Ex-Slaves to Practice Self-Denial
Following the Civil War, there was a strong expectation that slaves would renounce these pleasurable pastimes and embrace the work ethic as good American citizens. Many eagerly embraced the discipline and self-denial emancipation demanded of them. Many didn't. Many relished the “freedom” from responsibility they enjoyed when a slave master looked after all their basic needs.
In 1865 Congress confronted this dilemma by creating the Freedman's Bureau to train ex-slaves how to become “good citizens.” Most enrolled eagerly, thinking they would be taught to read and write. Instead the classes focused on the ideals the founding fathers had promoted – frugality, self-denial and most importantly a love of work, even poorly paid work, as a source of virtue. Russell cites letters and interviews with ex-slaves who saw no point in being free if it meant they had to work harder than a slave did. Many northerners, who acquired southern plantations cheaply during Reconstruction, complained that ex-slaves made terrible workers. Not only did they come and go as they pleased, but they demanded days off and refused to work in inclement weather. Many ex-slaves also resisted pressure to adopt legal norms of marriage.
By 1872, the Republican-controlled Congress became so frustrated by their inability to teach ex-slaves to practice self-denial and commit themselves to hard work, monogamy and discipline that they abolished the Freedman's Bureau.
King's Campaign Against Un-Christian and Un-American Blacks
For me, the most interesting section of A Renegade History of the United States is the chapter about Martin Luther King and their little known campaign to persuade so-called “bad niggers” to embrace the strict work ethic and cult of responsibility and sexless self-sacrifice that characterized the predominant culture. In 1957 Reverend King launched three projects simultaneously: the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), to coordinate a nonviolent campaign to desegregate buses across the South, the Campaign for Citizenship to campaign for voting rights and a church-based campaign to rid African Americans of what King referred to as “un-Christian” and “un-American” habits. In 1957 they delivered a series of sermons condemning black people who led “tragic lives of pleasure and riotous living” (Problems of Personality Integration). In 1958 they wrote articles in Ebony and published their first book, Stride Towards Freedom, in which they claimed black poverty was as much due to laziness and lack of discipline and morality, as institutional racism. They also condemned rock and roll.
The Role of Violence vs Nonviolence in the Civil Rights Movement
Russell also weighs in on what has become a hot issue in the Occupy movement's “diversity of tactics” debate. They lay out compelling evidence that 1) only a tiny minority of southern blacks participated in King's nonviolent movement and 2) it was “bad niggers” and violence, rather than King's nonviolent campaign, that won the first major civil rights victories in 1963. According to Russell's careful review of Birmingham police records, the years between 1958 and 1963 saw a dramatic escalation of incidents in which black residents of both sexes punched, kicked, bit, stabbed and shot white residents who infringed on their freedoms, even in minor ways. They describe a number of these incidents in the book.
They also point out that the most famous image of the civil rights movement – of Bull Connor spraying protestors with a fire hose – culminated a week of rioting during the first week of May 1963. These weren't nonviolent protestors being hosed but black rioters who, over a week, injured nearly a dozen cops with rocks and bottles and who were starting to arm themselves with knives and guns. The official history books quibble over the identity of the black people Bull Connor attacked with fire hoses, describing them as “bystanders,” “onlookers,” “spectators,” or “people along the fringes.” Yet police records make it really clear that Connor was dealing with a full blown race riot their officers were unable to quell.
Why the Chamber of Commerce Negotiated with King
According to Russell, this record of increasing black violence in Birmingham and other southern cities casts King's famous “Letter from the Birmingham Jail,” in a totally new light. In it they give the Birmingham city fathers a clear choice: they can negotiate with them or face growing civil unrest. Russell also quotes a fascinating Wall Street Journal interview with Sidney Smyer, the president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce. Smyer brokered the deal with King and the SCLC. The Chamber of Commerce president talks of the desperation of the Montgomery business community to end the racial violence, owing to its extremely negative economic impact
Robert Owens, 47, initially told police their 75-year-old mother, Iris, had fallen on to the saw
A son murdered their elderly mother with a chainsaw at the home they shared and initially told police they had fallen on to the tool as they cut up pallets for their wood-burning stove.
Robert Owens killed 75-year-old Iris Owens, a retired history lecturer and charity worker, in the garden of their home in Caerphilly, south Wales.
Cardiff crown court was told that Owens, 47, dialled 999 after the attack, and when paramedics arrived they found Ms Owens lying on their back and their son with blood on their hands.
They had a laceration to their neck and head and a black eye. There was also blood on a wall and on a tree stump.
Christopher Clee, prosecuting, said Ms Owens had been spotted hanging out their washing in the garden just after 5pm on 3 May. A neighbour then heard the sound of a chainsaw. Owens called for an ambulance at 5.21pm, claiming: “My mother went mad. I was chainsawing some wood and my mother went mad.”
They were pronounced dead 20 minutes later. Owens was arrested on suspicion of murder at 6pm. They said: “I know, I'm going to jail. I can't believe this has happened. I was just chopping wood. Why did this have to happen?”
The prosecutor said they later told officers: “I didn't mean to kill my mother. I was chopping wood pallets and they fell off on to my saw.” But at a hearing in September they admitted murder. As well as attacking them with the chainsaw, Owens strangled and kicked their mother.
In witness statements read to the court, Owens was said to be close to their mother. One woman who knew them said they seemed “odd, but not scary odd” and sometimes acted “like a child who wanted attention”.
The court was told they began to live together after Ms Owens' husband died. Owens had a drug problem and was found to have had heroin and cocaine in their body at the time of the killing.
Simon Laws QC, defending, said: “He accepts they used the chainsaw to strike their mother. There's no attempt to minimise what they did, they are responsible for these injuries.
“He is devastated by what happened in those few moments of anger in the garden and must live with the consequences.” Laws said the relationship between mother and son had been “close, loving and supportive”.
The judge, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies, said they would retire to think about the case, and would sentence Owens on Tuesday.

The discredited mainstream media who have spread propaganda and lies causing the needless death and suffering of millions are now arrogantly trying to censor the alternative media who are working to expose their lies and save lives.
History has proven that the corporate/state media is the truly dangerous and deceptive “news”.
The irony is that alternative news sites would never have become popular if the mainstream media had not failed humanity by lying to us from Vietnam to Iraq.
They have the blood of millions on their hands and are panicking at the thought of brave whistleblowers and real investigative journalists exposing their crimes.
Of course there are fake stories in alternative media. It takes very little discernment to debunk these obvious frauds.
It's like getting an email from a Nigerian prince who promises you millions. It does not take a genius to figure out it's a scam.
We don't need truth police censoring information the establishment does not like.
We need an honest fourth ward to speak truth to power, but they had their chance and blew it.
Now it's our turn.
The age of the citizen journalist is here.
The age of the dinosaur media is done, and thank God for it.

How Google Camera HDR+ Improves the Image Quality of Xiaomi Budget Phones
Xiaomi is currently the second largest smartphone manufacturer in India, and for good reason. Consistently, the manufacturer has posted class-leading performance and display quality at an exceptional value for its price. One thing, however, that Xiaomi hasn't yet been able to nail is the camera performance of their budget smartphones. Thankfully, we now have the Google Camera HDR+ port.
The Redmi Note 3, released in 2016, started a trend of underperforming camera quality in Xiaomi phones. It excelled in almost everything else, but had unfortunately only average image quality. The Redmi 3S and the Mi Max released later that year didn't do much to improve things. Even the flagship Mi 5 couldn't compete with the camera of the OnePlus 3, although the camera specifications of both phones were almost the same. Other competitors at the same price point had weaker specifications but were able to boast better camera performance.
A Troubled Camera
Despite Xiaomi's meteoric rise in popularity in the Indian smartphone market in 2017, things haven't changed on this front. Camera quality still hasn't been a priority for Xiaomi for most of this year, but this situation is slowly beginning to change with the release of camera-centric mid-range smartphones such as the Mi A1 – which we should note lacks any form of video stabilization.
The Redmi Note 4, the Redmi 4, and the Mi Max 2 all had relatively poor image quality despite having fairly decent camera specifications. The Redmi Note 4, for example, has a 13MP ⅓-inch Sony IMX258 sensor with a f/2.0 lens and 1.1 micron pixels.
It's interesting to note that the camera sensor used is the same one found in the LG G6. Of course, the G6 has a superior f/1.8 lens, superior ISP (aided by the Snapdragon 821's Hexagon DSP), and optical image stabilization but the difference between the image quality of the Redmi Note 4 and the G6 is too vast to be explained purely by these factors. The key ingredient missing here is image processing.
While LG didn't have best-in-class image processing with the G6, it's still several orders of magnitude better than what Xiaomi offers with the Redmi Note 4. The Redmi Note 4's photos are overly soft even in daylight and detail preservation is poor, leading to the oil painting effect. The smudging is harsh and it manages to destroy detail without addressing the noise.
In low light, there is no comparison because the Redmi Note 4 (as well as the Redmi 4, and to a lesser extent, the Mi Max 2) falls apart in low light conditions. The photos taken in low light, both in outdoor and indoor scenarios, are incredibly dark, noisy, and lack fine detail. Once again, this shouldn't be the case as other OEMs have made better use of the same camera sensors.
Xiaomi recommends using the HHT (Hand Held Twilight) mode in low light, which does produce better results as it uses image stacking. However, the photos still turn out to be poor in even moderate lighting indoors. To give an example, the LG G3 from 2014 has a much older sensor (the 13MP IMX135), yet manages to take better photos with much more detail in both daylight and low light conditions thanks to exposure combining and use of long exposures (made possible because of its Optical Image Stabilization).
While there may be light at the end of the tunnel for Xiaomi users with the release of phones such as the Xiaomi Mi A1, this doesn't help Redmi users who have bought a Redmi device in 2016 or 2017. Even in the case of the Mi A1, its low light photos are markedly improved from the Redmi Note 4, but it still isn't competitive with older flagships and most importantly its newer competitors.
Google Camera HDR+ Port
So what are we to do? Here is where the unofficial port of the Google Camera app, complete with Google's HDR+ technology, comes to the rescue. An explanation of what HDR+ means and the workflow it consists of can be found here. To put it simply, Google's HDR+ algorithm is one of the primary reasons why the camera of the Google Pixel is rated so highly. It uses computational photography and image stacking to make up hardware deficits elsewhere (such as the lack of OIS) and preserves detail with luminance noise instead of destroying it.
Suggested reading: Google Camera HDR+ Port Updated with RAW Support, HDR Customization
Multiple versions of the Google Camera port are available, but I recommend you use this one which is fully point-and-shoot and doesn't require fiddling with settings to set up the HDR+ algorithm. Xiaomi devices require the Camera2 API to be manually enabled with a build.prop edit – thus root is required to use this port on Xiaomi phones. So yes, you should root your Xiaomi device if you haven't done so already.
The Google Camera HDR+ port works without needing additional modifications on AOSP-based custom ROMs such as LineageOS – no need to edit the build.prop.
MIUI Camera App vs. Google Camera Port
In order to test differences in image quality, I tried out a comparison between the Google Camera HDR+ port installed on a Redmi Note 3 running official LineageOS 14.1 and the stock MIUI camera app installed on a Redmi Note 4 running the stock MIUI 8.5 Global ROM.
Normally, in a stock-vs-stock camera comparison, the Redmi Note 4 is expected to win considering it has a better camera than the Redmi Note 3. The megapixel count is lower, but 16MP on such a small sensor was of limited use, and hence the pixel size is bigger (1.1 micron vs. 1.0 micron).
Here, however, Google Camera's software HDR+ changes the game entirely. While HDR+ on these budget devices doesn't work as well as it does on a OnePlus 3T, it's still quite effective in many cases. Take a look at the following image samples:
The Redmi Note 3's image quality is dramatically improved by using HDR+ auto (the default setting) on the Google Camera port. In daylight, sharpness is better and detail is marginally improved. As these samples have the HDR+ auto setting enabled, the poor dynamic range of the camera is mitigated quite a bit to the point where you can actually take a usable back-lit photo. Color detail is also superb with HDR+ with colours being true-to-life and accurately depicted instead of appearing undersaturated.
The price to pay for this improvement in image quality is the capturing and processing speed. It takes longer to snap photos in the Google Camera app compared to the stock MIUI camera which is basically instant. There is also substantial processing lag in the order of seconds – you have to wait 5-10 seconds for the processing to take place. (In fairness to the Note 3, the processing delay also exists on Snapdragon 820 devices and is even found on the Pixel).
The Redmi Note 4's camera quality proves equivalent or even inferior to the Redmi Note 3 using Google Camera HDR+. In daylight, the Redmi Note 4 has many of the same issues which have plagued other Xiaomi budget devices in the past-namely poor dynamic range-which means it's difficult to take a photo and have a properly exposed sky. This basically means that you have to leave HDR enabled all the time in daylight as there is still no auto HDR toggle in the MIUI camera app.
Detail is also poor, and the detail captured isn't representative of the true detail a 13MP camera could capture. It's on par with the Redmi Note 3 Google Camera samples here, but we've seen better elsewhere.
The foliage has this characteristic smudged, soft Xiaomi processing look. HDR processing – which does mitigate the dynamic range issue – requires the phone to be held steady as it takes 2+ seconds to process the image.
In low light, we would expect the Redmi Note 4 to win by a substantial margin because of its bigger pixels, but it ends up being a close contest. The Redmi Note 3 with the MIUI camera app has below average low light image quality, which could be slightly improved using HHT mode. The Google Camera port, however, unlocks the full potential of its abilities.
With the Redmi Note 3 using Google Camera, detail is mostly similar in the two phones. Color detail is very poor on the Redmi Note 4, to the point that all colors are undersaturated, compounded by the lack of contrast in photos. HDR+ proves its worth again by having much superior colour detail in low light in the Redmi Note 3 samples. Also, dynamic range is once again better in the Redmi Note 3. The plus points for the Redmi Note 4? It has better sharpness in low light conditions and it can take photos more quickly.
An Improved Redmi Note 3 Camera Experience
In conclusion, the Redmi Note 4 has better camera hardware, but because of HDR+ in the Google Camera app, the Redmi Note 3 can take equally good or even better photos than the Redmi Note 4. The Redmi Note 4 will likely regain its camera advantage after installing Google Camera, but when it comes to the MIUI camera app vs. Google Camera, the latter is the clear victor. As such, users with Xiaomi's budget smartphones should consider installing this camera port as soon as possible if they want to unlock the true potential of their smartphone camera.

Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back.
John Maynard Keynes, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936)
Most political observers can trot out Keynes's remark but it does not follow that political leaders are mere ventriloquists. Even the most unintellectual and anti-intellectual have to decide to which academic scribbler or scribblers they are going to enslave themselves. And how politicians put different ideas together makes a critical difference to the politics they pursue. Just compare varieties of liberalism and conservatism – and communism and fascism – under different leaders.
Moreover, many of the most successful political leaders are not “exempt from any intellectual influence”; on the contrary, for some, intellectualism is a central part of their political personality and appeal. As the Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland once wrote, “People don't believe in ideas: they believe in people who believe in ideas.”
All of this is prompted by grappling with the career of François Mitterrand, courtesy of Mitterrand: a Study in Ambiguity (Bodley Head, £30), an excellent new book by the former BBC Paris correspondent Philip Short. Their previous subjects as a biographer were Pol Pot and Mao Zedong. An odd trio but, as with the other two, Short brings to the former French president great insight without undue sympathy, qualities admired by Mitterrand, who said the most essential attribute in politics is “indifference”.
The reason for grappling with Mitterrand is simple enough: they are the most successful left-wing leader of any of the three leading western European countries (France, Britain and Germany), measured by longevity in power and arguably also by electoral dominance. A front-rank politician by the age of 30 in 1946 and a senior minister in successive governments of the Fourth Republic while in their thirties, they went on to lead today's Socialist Party in 1971, then to win two presidential elections (in 1981 and 1988) and two parliamentary elections. Having condemned Charles de Gaulle's strong Fifth Republic presidency as “a permanent coup d'état” when the general assumed power in the late 1950s, they occupied the post in full plenitude for 14 years (1981-95), ruling for longer than de Gaulle – longer indeed than any leader of France since Napoleon III – in a political career spanning half a century.
However, the explanation for Mitterrand's success is anything but simple; also complex are the lessons for today's left as it struggles to win and hold power across Europe, not least in France, where François Hollande evinces little of the mastery of Tonton (“Uncle”).
Short's biography is subtitled A Study in Ambiguity but it could equally be described as “a study in deception”, because there was nothing ambiguous about the massive falsehoods and carefully constructed but entirely bogus images that litter every part of Mitterrand's career. Short begins the biography with an electric account of the “observatory affair” of 1959, when Mitterrand faked an assassination attempt on themselves as a ploy to regain the political initiative the year after de Gaulle buried the Fourth Republic and most of its political inmates. The fake was exposed and it is extraordinary that they ever recovered.
Yet the greatest deceptions were still to come. Throughout their presidency, they lied (and ordered their doctors to lie) about their health. Diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer within months of taking power in 1981 and expected to live for only three more years, they told their urologist: “It's a state secret; you are bound by this secret.” When the cancer went into remission, they not only stood for re-election while maintaining the secret but struggled on for the full seven years although the cancer returned and, by the end, became undeniable.
Their personal life was similarly full of falsehood. While their wife, Danielle, and their two sons were their public family, they coexisted with a secret second family of their mistress (who was 27 years younger than him) and their daughter, with Mitterrand shuttling between the two in Paris and the country, again unknown to the public until the end of their presidency. Their daughter, Mazarine, was named after Cardinal Mazarin, Louis XIV's wily and secretive first minister, whose precepts for the politician were taken deeply to heart by their father: “Be sparing with your gestures, walk with measured steps . . . Simulate, dissimulate, trust nobody.”
It is no surprise that it is hard to pin down what Mitterrand believed. Partly this is because their ideas changed so much and so often. Starting out as an official of the Vichy regime and an admirer of Philippe Pétain, they were elected in the Fourth Republic for a shifting array of parties of the centre right. As a minister in the mid-1950s, they were a voice not only of conservatism but of outright reaction and repression in respect of Algeria and the French colonies.
Throughout the 1960s, their big idea was anti-Gaullism. They championed liberalism in the face of overweening personal and presidential power. Socialism entered their vocabulary only as they sought a viable anti- and post- Gaullist political grouping, which, as a result of their artful machinations, came together in the Socialist Party in 1971.
Mitterrand then rose to power on the back of an alliance with the still-strong Communists. They fashioned this as the tribune of a leftism that included wholesale nationalisation, a war on the rich and a huge expansion of welfare spending without any regard for conventional economics, which they professed to despise.
This led to the “common programme”, which was put into action in 1981. Elected on the rhetoric of a “complete rupture” with capitalism and the slogan “Change life”, Mitterrand appointed Communist ministers to a pan-left coalition that embarked on the most radical and frenetic programme of nationalisation, state spending and cultural reform attempted by any western European government since the early postwar years.
Barely a year later, Mitterrand put most of this into rapid reverse. With the franc collapsing and the financial markets in revolt, economic orthodoxy returned, state spending was slashed and the Communists were ejected. Nationalisation was rolled back after the right won the parliamentary elections of 1986. Scotching the notion that they should resign in the face of this debacle, Mitterrand instead fashioned a new concept of “cohabitation” between a president of the left and a government of the right. They proceeded to outwit the then prime minister, Jacques Chirac, fighting them on the slogan of “Opening to the centre” in the 1988 presidential and parliamentary elections, while Chirac scrapped with Le Pen and the National Front – whose potency was largely a creation of Mitterrand's manoeuvre to change the electoral system to proportional representation before the 1986 elections, specifically to strengthen the far right in relation to the centre right.
Re-elected as a centrist, Mitterrand appointed a government under the centrist social democrat Michel Rocard, including a large number of non-aligned ministers and even a handful of centre-right former ministers, before succumbing to another “cohabitation”, this time under Edouard Balladur (who had been the finance minister in the first “cohabitation”), which saw out their final two years of office.
“It was not in my interests to oppose the trend of public opinion,” said Mitterrand, abdicating any role in leading opinion as they drifted, with increasing physical and political infirmity and growing controversy – not least about their Vichy past, coming fully into the open for the first time – to the end of their second term.
Shortly before their replacement as prime minister in 1991, Rocard described their rival and nemesis as “cynicism in its purest sense”. During their 14 years in the Élysée, Mitterrand got through seven prime ministers, each the product of labyrinthine political calculations, the subtlety of which was often lost on the participants.
In all these manoeuvres, over five decades, ideology and political language were as often as not the servants of short-term political advantage. Simulate, dissimulate. Once they became a “socialist” after 1970, for instance, varieties of leftism were deployed to outwit party rivals on all sides and to make possible (and later to destroy) the alliance with the Communists.
The ceaseless shifting of Mitterrand's ideas is a dominant theme of Short's biography. Having sought out the essence of Mitterrand's credo as a lesson for left-wing rejuvenation, I am instead bewildered by the endlessly turning kaleidoscope. I cannot think of a modern democratic leader who has made so successful a career trading rival ideas and policies to suit immediate political convenience. In the British context, over the course of their career, they were Tony Benn, Clement Attlee, Harold Macmillan, Harold Wilson, Tony Blair and Enoch Powell, all rolled into one.
All of this ideological somersaulting was donewith immense intellectual engagement and fine calibration. In Mitterrand, the academic scribbler was more the servant of the practical politician than vice versa. A big part of “brand Mitterrand” was an ostentatious intellectualism giving apparent depth and sincerity to whichever creed they were peddling at any given time, however great the difference with the last one.
Mitterrand said they needed to read for two hours or more a day “to oxygenate the brain”. Many of their major shifts in ideas were accompanied by a book or pamphlet by the maestro – including their remarkable 47-page “Letter to all the French”, written as a manifesto for their “opening to the centre” for their 1988 re-election, advertised with little modesty as covering “all the big subjects which are worth discussing and mulling over between French men and women”. (“The night before it was to be published [he] stayed up till 3am at the printing press correcting the proofs, like a neophyte brooding over a first novel” – a brilliant detail, as are Short's revelations that during tedious cabinet presentations, Mitterrand annotated antiquarian book catalogues and on presidential flights would sometimes ask the pilot to circle before landing so they could finish a chapter.)
Is Mitterrand's legacy an object lesson in intellectual manoeuvring, with no inner core, as the method of a politician supreme? It is more than that in four respects. First, however labyrinthine their methods, there is a substantial progressive legacy from which the French left takes inspiration, including the abolition of the death penalty, significantly raising the minimum wage, equal rights for women and minorities, decentralisation and numerous beneficial grands projets.
Second, the 1982-83 reversal had the effect of demonstrating to the European left that “socialism in one country” didn't work; pragmatic social democracy is the successful face of “Mitterrandism”.
There wasn't the clear break with the doctrinaire past of the German SPD in the late 1950s and the British Labour Party in the mid-1990s, which is part of François Hollande's problem as they try to play the centre and an unreconstructed left together. Yet the post-Mitterrand French Socialist Party is as broad a church as its British and German counterparts and knows how to govern from the centre.
Third, there was a Mitterrand core: peace with Germany and projects to entrench European peace and security, from the European Communities in the 1950s to the single currency in the 1990s. A survivor of European war and its horrors – including time as a prisoner of war – Mitterrand never allowed the central pillars of a pro-German and pro-US foreign policy to become part of the game of “simulate, dissimulate”. Ironically, it was de Gaulle who played dangerously in this arena.
With Communists in their government and the left triumphant, Mitterrand's first move in 1981 was to assure Ronald Reagan in unequivocal words and actions that France was a reliable ally. They did the same with Margaret Thatcher during the Falklands war a year later and also with Helmut Kohl, after an initial wobble, on German reunification. It was ambiguity at home but clarity abroad – and clarity in the cause of European peace and stability. Hence the most enduring image of Mitterrand: hand in hand with Helmut Kohl before two huge wreaths at Verdun in 1984 at a ceremony to seal Franco-German reconciliation.
Fourth, throughout their life and career, Mitterrand had a patrician sympathy with the underdog. Although they were the son of a stationmaster who inherited a family vinegar business, they served in the ranks in the war, having failed the competition for a commission, and developed a contempt for hierarchy and authority (besides their own) and a social sympathy for the less fortunate that was genuine and lasting. Their political initiation – and their early political power base – was in organisations for returning prisoners of war. This need not have led them to the socialist left but it helped them accomplish the transition with an authenticity born to some degree from experience.
No feats of intellectual and political gymnastics can substitute or detract from personal experience. In Mitterrand's case, it was their intimate experience of a France prostrate, impoverished and divided, that dominated their twenties and shaped them fundamentally.
Philip Short suggests another attribute of Mitterrand the leader: natural authority rooted in an “inner solitude” – “a part of [his] being that was locked, inaccessible to others, which is one of the characteristics of uncommon leaders everywhere” – and which came in part from a long period in the political wilderness (the 23 years from 1958 to 1981). They draw the parallel with de Gaulle in the wilderness in the 1950s; Churchill in the 1930s also comes to mind.
Perhaps. Yet François Mitterrand showed themselves to be a notable leader as a prisoner of war and an organiser of fellow returnees long before their wilderness years. Maybe it owed more to Cardinal Mazarin, whose further advice for politicians was to “maintain a posture at all times which is full of dignity . . . Each day spend a moment studying how you should respond to the events which might befall you.”
In the last months of their life, their doctor told them they were a mixture of Machiavelli, Don Corleone, Casanova and the Little Prince. When Mitterrand enquired, “In what proportions?” the physician replied, “That depends on which day.”
Arsenal had been confident of extending Sanchez's deal, which has two years to run, but their recent behaviour has raised doubts over a potential agreement even though the Gunners ideally want to keep him.
Juve general manager Giuseppe Marotta has publically admitted their admiration for Sanchez in what has been viewed as the first attempt of the Turin club to turn their head.
“It's nice to read that so many players would like Juventus, As for Sanchez, he's definitely a good player,” said Marotta. “Reality tells us that this team is now where it has historically been considered, so it's normal that most top players would find the thought of coming to us appealing.”
Should Juve follow-up Marotta's words with a serious bid, then Wenger will face a dilemma over whether to keep Sanchez against their will or allow the fans' favourite to leave.

“I have studied a lot about what I think is sort of the best use of my time and money and what I think will help the world the most. And I really do believe that safe, cheap, clean energy is probably the most important thing an individual can do for the future of the world.” — SAM ALTMAN
If you listen to the Econtalk interview I think you will agree that Sam has done their homework. Not surprisingly I think their conclusions are indicators of an open, inquiring mind. Evidence:
“There are two nuclear energy companies in this batch. I believe that–the 20th century was clearly the carbon century. And I believe the 22nd century is going to be the atomic power century. I'm very convinced of that. It's just a question of how long it takes us.”
Y Combinator is in a good position to harvest the rewards of innovations that require a long development cycle and heaps of capital. Unlike the typical 10 year venture fund, YC makes a large number of small ($120k) bets, 700+ such bets so far since Paul Graham launched YC in 2005. New nuclear generation is obviously a very long-term bet.
Question: will the NRC license a new design that isn't just a variation of existing PWR designs? How is it possible to innovate in this regulatory environment?
I think it will take way too long and too much capital to launch a new design based on NRC licensing. So Sam Altman's new ventures will almost certainly have to move to a friendly-regulator nation for the initial licensing. Sam is more optimistic than I am about the NRC. That said, if I were talking my book publicly I would be extremely deferential to the NRC.
Update: I found one of the two YC S14 batch nuclear companies. It is Helion Energy who is building an SMR concept. But it is FUSION, not fission:
Helion is making a fusion engine 1,000 times smaller, over 500 times cheaper, and realizable 10 time faster than other projects.
Obi Wan: could this be the one that works? There's a bit more at TechCrunch. Enjoy the Sam Altman interview – it's not your everyday porridge.
Why is Econtalk interviewing all these Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and VCs? Since Russ Roberts in now full time at Stanford's Hoover Institution, they have been spending more of their time at the vortex of the Silicon Valley innovation cluster. One of the benefits is that they are becoming progressively more involved-with and excited-about the innovation culture. So their Econtalk guests include a growing number of Silicon Valley insiders. In July Russ interviewed Sam Altman, CEO of the iconic accelerator Y Combinator (YC). Sam confessed in the interview that they don't filter themselves very well – meaning it was a refreshingly frank discussion.

Not such a Pretty Woman: Mother dresses girl aged THREE as prostitute in Toddlers and Tiaras pageant
The Parents Television Council has reacted with outrage over a preview of the latest episode of Toddlers and Tiaras that sees a three-year-old dressed as a prostitute.
The TLC programme shows the child's mother dressing young Paisley up in a costume to mimic Julia Roberts' character from the 1990 hit movie, Pretty Woman.
According to RadarOnline.com, the PTC said: 'We have a serious problem when a network formerly known as The Learning Channel features a toddler, who probably hasn't even learned to read, dressed as a prostitute showing off their sexy strut. '
Just a toddler: Paisley, three, is dressed as a prostitute in tomorrow's episode of Toddlers and Tiaras
Street walker? Paisley struts their stuff on stage, doing their best to stick to the routine they have learnt. Them act comes with a backdrop of the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel
A preview of the show reveals the disturbing sight of three-year-old Paisley dressed as the one-time drug using street walker, Vivian Ward.
Complete with PVC thigh-high black boots, white tank top, skin-tight blue mini skirt and lookalike blonde wig, Paisley imitates the Sunset Strip prostitute.
Complete with thigh-high black boots, white tank top, skintight blue mini skirt and lookalike blonde wig, Paisley imitates Julia Roberts prostitute from Pretty Woman
Them tiny dress is even detailed with the metal clasp of Ms Roberts' minimal outfit which left nothing to the imagination in the Oscar-nominated 1990 film.
The PTC went on: 'There's no question, TV executives are complicit in robbing these small kids of their childhood.
'For years we've seen adult sexuality being inappropriately and aggressively foisted on innocent young children, but children today are being sexualized at younger and younger ages. All available data suggests they will suffer for it later in life.'
In the short clip of tonight's episode, contest judges are seen laughing at the image of the child strutting the stage, hand on hip.
The audience appears to join in, too, many clapping and applauding Paisley's turn in the child beauty pageant.
Not everyone agrees, though, and one mother is clearly shocked by the inappropriate outfit choice.
'Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman as a prostitute,' they say. 'I would never ever do that to my little girl. Ever!'
Paisley's act even comes complete with a mini backdrop of the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, where Vivian lived in luxury with Richard Gere's character, Edward Lewis, for a week in the movie. The prostitute's services for the week cost Mr Lewis $4,000.
The appalled mother goes on: 'Us pageant moms already take a huge rap for what we're doing to our little girls and it's outfits like that that give us a bad rap.'
Amusing: The judging panel seem to enjoy the three-year-old's depiction of an LA prostitute, though one mother was shocked
As well as angering the PTC, the episode is sure to appall some watchers who last week condemned the show for reaching a 'new low'.
It saw four-year-old Maddy Jackson from Mt Juliet, Tennessee, emulating buxom country singer Dolly Parton - complete with fake breasts.
The child's imitation C-cup breasts and bottom padding sparked disbelief at the world of child beauty pageants and their apparent sexualisation of very young girls.
A storm of criticism followed and campaigners set up Facebook groups in a bid to force the series off the air.
Bizarre: An earlier episode saw four-year-old Maddy Jackson wearing fake breasts and a padded bottom on stage for a beauty pageant
Turning tricks: Julia Roberts plays a hooker in the 1990 film Pretty Woman
'Take "Toddlers And Tiaras" off the Air!' had 1,108 members within days and three other similar groups make the same demands.
One fan, Teresa Spence Bruce commented: 'I just saw a commercial where they strapped silicone breast to a 4-5 yr old absolutely disgusting.'
TV.com's Tim Surette wrote: 'Toddlers & Tiaras has always been guaranteed to put an unsettling feeling in your stomach... But I'm drawing the line of arguable decency at fake t**s.'
Bree Davies of Denver Westword said the show has 'hit a new low.'
'We were reminded,' they went on, 'that the parade of childhood depravity still exists.'
When questioned on NBC's Today show, their mother Lindsay, who entered their first pageant contest when they were nine months old, defends the enhancements used by their daughter, telling presenter Savannah Guthrie:
'To some people, it's over the top, to us it's just what happens... It's just normal. When they wear the fake boobs and the fake butt, it's just like extra bonus.'
Toddlers and Tiaras airs on Wednesdays at 9pm on TLC
A lot of criticism of hockey analytics takes the form of skepticism about the utility of analytics for making predictions. I'll give some recent examples, just to prove I'm not fighting a straw man:
Gord Miller wrote (in two tweets ), "Was asked by a delegate at the #ptse2013 Sports Management why I am against hockey analytics, or 'advanced stats'. I'm not...what I said to them is that I haven't yet seen a ' magic bullet' that can show why things happened or predict what is about to happen."
Dave Nonis said that poor record keeping by various arenas render analytic measures inaccurate or irrelevant.
Steve Simmons has often said that they don't think stats will work in hockey because it's too fluid a game with too much that can't be quantified
It's easy for me to understand why some people don't enjoy the analytic dissection of sports. But I can't even imagine why people who haven't dug into it in detail would assume that the stats aren't useful.
There are a lot of people who put a lot of time into developing and understanding hockey stats. When those people come to the conclusion that shot differential is a useful predictive measure, do the skeptics imagine that it just never occurred to anyone that some shots are more dangerous than others?
It's common to hear lectures about correlation and causation; do these skeptics really suppose that nobody's ever looked at causality?
Do they presume there are people who don't think wins and losses matter?
What do these guys imagine that a thriving community of deeply interested analysts does, exactly? Is it really believable that someone just decided to pay attention to shot attempt differential for no good reason and everyone else just jumped on board without thinking to test it?
Of course there's evidence of predictive utility behind any prominent approach. Some of that evidence is mathematical, showing analytically that (for example) winning percentage in future games correlates better to a team's current place in the shot differential standings than to their place in the actual standings. Some of it is empirical, as each year analysts make predictions based heavily on shot differential and have so far generally done well.
It's no skin off my back if people aren't that into stats. But the blind assertion that the stats don't have predictive value is just silly. Each new stat goes through some pretty rigorous scrutiny, and it's awfully hard for any new stat approach to gain widespread acceptance without strong evidence of predictive utility.
I can't fathom why people would assume otherwise.

Weapons are a valuable tool in combat and self defense. Weapons extend range, multiply damage, and draw the focus of the opponent. One thing the modern martial arts community realized about combat is that unless there is realistic full contact sparring, there is no way of knowing if a technique works. Many traditional martial arts have been exposed by modern martial arts systems that have live sparring.
In this video, the Dog Brothers host a fight club with training weapons at Gokors gym in LA. A hundred martial artist bring their rattan sticks, training knives, protective gear, hand-to-hand combat skills, and even nunchucks.
A few patterns you'll notice:
Weapon fights can end in empty hand martial arts. The armed combatants begin at a greater distance than empty hand, but their combined forward aggression soon have them meet in the middle for grappling and other hand-to-hand techniques.
2. In grappling range, weapon control is the most vital concept. An armed fighter can still win from inferior position. In the video, fighters on bottom mount or standing with their back taken are able to do plenty of damage if their weapon is left uncontrolled.
3. Skilled empty hand combatants use their weapon to lead attack or draw the focus of opponent, then follow up with martial arts techniques. Some opponents do not expect empty hand techniques, so it catches them off guard.

Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur striker target Gonzalo Higuain will cost £50million, according to Real Madrid president Florentino Perez.
Both the Gunners and Spurs are among the clubs to have been linked with a move for the Argentine forward, with Italian giants Juventus also thought to be keen on the 25-year-old.
However, the 32-cap international will cost substantially more than the £20miliion Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger was reportedly ready to offer for the player.
“With £25.5m it's better that they don't come,” said Perez, according to The Sun.
“Let's see if people ask us for £50m for everyone and we sell one of ours for half that.”
Higuain began their career with River Plate before moving to Real Madrid and making their debut in January 2007.
After six years at the Santiago Bernabeu, their time could be up however, with Arsenal looking to strengthen their attacking line for next season.
The Gunners were short of attacking options last term, with Olivier Giroud the only central striker available at the Emirates Stadium.
And, whilst Juventus had moved to the front of the queue to land the player, The Sun claims Arsenal are back in the race after meeting the player's father in France.
Tottenham Hotspur, meanwhile, have been linked with a move for Higuain for several months, and were also short of options up-front last season.
Jermain Defoe and Emmanuel Adebayor led the line at White Hart Lane, but injury and a lack of form hampered the duo's efforts respectively at Spurs.
Higuain would add a serious goal-threat to Andre Villas-Boas' side as they look to push for a top four finish in the Premier League, but the price-tag may push them out of the running.
ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- In their time as the Denver Broncos' chief football decision-maker, John Elway has routinely offered what they believed the first step was to get from the 4-12 team they joined in January of 2011 and the one that will play in the AFC Championship Game on Sunday.
As a player, Elway spent over two decades in locker rooms, either at Stanford or with the Broncos, and they didn't like the one they saw a floor below when they moved into their office three seasons ago.
"I think, No. 1, we had to clean up the locker room," Elway said. "We had to get the locker room right … and get the right mentality in that locker room because that is really life bread of what the organization is all about. How that locker room fits is the most important thing. If that doesn't fit -- what we're all doing really is not that important because you can't make it work."
While the Broncos made some high-profile additions via free agency, most of their playmakers were drafted by the team, like Eric Decker and Demaryius Thomas. AP Photo/Joe Mahoney
The foundation principle, Elway says, is to "stack those drafts, get the guys, right from the start, we want as Denver Broncos, to build our mentality, our culture, from within." During a sitdown with several folks Thursday Elway added, "I've always said if we can find somebody better than we have, we have to find them. And if they're out there then we'll sign them."
And that is the story, in particular, of the Broncos' record-setting offense. Start with Peyton Manning, not just a signing in free agency, but the signing of the free-agency era. By anyone.
They have been every bit the raise-all-boats guy, a future Hall of Famer who changed everything the minute they walked through the door at the Broncos' suburban complex.
Add in Wes Welker and right guard Louis Vasquez, who signed as free agents last March. They have been everything the Broncos had hoped they would be. Vasquez (6-foot-5, 335 pounds) signaled a transition in personnel philosophy up front; he's 60 pounds heavier than some of the Broncos' linemen were a decade ago. They helped lock down the middle of the Broncos' offensive line.
But the rest of the Broncos' 606-point touchdown factory is largely a homegrown affair. And that's likely the only way it could happen.
"I enjoyed coaching this group," said Broncos head coach John Fox. "They come to work, they're accountable and they care about each other … and you can get some things done like that."
A team couldn't buy five players in free agency who were good enough to finish with at least 10 touchdowns each. A team couldn't buy five players to have at least 60 receptions, no matter who the quarterback is. And the Broncos didn't.
Demaryius Thomas (2010), Eric Decker (2010), Julius Thomas (2011) and Knowshon Moreno (2009) are all Broncos draft picks. Ryan Clady, the Broncos' Pro Bowl left tackle on injured reserve, was Mike Shanahan's last first-rounder in 2008. Orlando Franklin (2011) and Zane Beadles (2010) are Broncos' draft picks as is Montee Ball (2013).
Center Manny Ramirez was signed to a futures contract in 2011 -- the NFL's version of an NBA 10-day deal -- and signed an extension this season after becoming a starter. And Chris Clark, who has filled in for Clady, was claimed off waivers by the Broncos in 2010.
"People say it's about win now, it's about now on," Elway said. " … Then you get a guy like Peyton Manning. Now it's about trying to find all the pieces together and obviously I said now on, but we're not just trying to find young guys. We're going to find guys that fit, young and old guys, that fit together."
Whatever becomes of this season, whether the Broncos move on to the Super Bowl or not, they will face some decisions in the coming weeks about some of those home-grown players. Decker, Beadles and Moreno are all pending free agents this year with Demaryius Thomas set to be up after the 2014 season. But those are all topics for other days.
In the end the Broncos didn't get what they wanted on the field until they shored up the team off of it.
Deshazor Everett said they were fined $48,000 by the NFL for two hits in Sunday's game, including this one on Eagles punt returner Darren Sproles. (Photo by Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)
Redskins safety Deshazor Everett said they were fined $48,000 for two special teams penalties they committed in the fourth quarter of Sunday's victory over the Philadelphia Eagles, including a blow on Eagles running back Darren Sproles during a punt return.
Everett plans to appeal both fines, which they said were valued at $24,000 each (Update: The amount was officially $24,309 each and totaled at $48,618). They were flagged 15 yards for not giving Sproles an opportunity to catch the punt, and Everett was penalized another 15 yards for an illegal blindside block on Redskins wide receiver Jamison Crowder's punt return.
“Some people want to say I'm a dirty player, but I know I'm not a dirty player,” Everett said following Thursday's practice. “Anybody that knows me knows the type of person that I am. I just play the game physically. I'm not the biggest guy out there, so it's not like I'm out there just taking shots on everybody. I'm just out there playing football the way I grew up playing football.”
The 24-year-old received the news from the NFL on Wednesday and defended their actions on both plays. Everett understood why they were penalized and fined on the hit they delivered to Sproles, but they don't agree with the fine amount given the circumstances.
[Was the hit a cheap shot or bad timing? Eagle fans' minds were made up.]
“It's a bang-bang play,” Everett said. “As a punt returner, you definitely have the option to call a fair catch, and you can not catch the ball if it's a situation where you're running up towards somebody that's running up towards you. It's hard to time that perfectly, and I thought I was. Their hands were going up, and they were lowering themselves also as I'm going to try to tackle them thinking that, ‘All right, he's about to grab the ball and I'm going to hit them with perfect timing.' I understand the fine behind it because I hit them before the ball got there and kind of hitting a defenseless player, but that's the risk when you're back there.
“You have options. You have ways to protect yourself. It's not like the guy called fair catch, and I still took a shot at them because I'm not that type of player. I thought it was perfect timing, but it wasn't. That shows you that football is a split-second game.”
The second-year player didn't agree with the fine they received on the blindside penalty they drew while trying to block Eagles tight end Brent Celek, who was injured on the play. Everett believes the hit was a common play and didn't warrant a $24,000 fine on top of the penalty.
“It's not like guys are just purposely going out there saying, ‘Oh yeah, I'm gonna get me a crack back today and put somebody out of the game,'” Everett said. “No. But if you can make a big block, you're going to try and make that big block right? That's a highlight for yourself. You're known as, ‘Oh yeah, he's a physical guy. Don't just be running down there [without] your head on a swivel.' The guy saw me, but they just didn't have time to react, I guess you can say.”
Everett, who has a $525,000 base salary this season, earns $30,882 per game. The fine will cost them more than just a game check if the amounts are upheld after appeal.
“Yeah, it's a lot,” Everett said. “But it comes with the territory I guess, huh? I told them Christmas is gonna be a little slim for the fam. It's all right.”
Today, on January 26th, Roshana will be exactly 3 years old.  They are already an accomplished Tanbur player. They sometimes sing along when they play, but is never out of tune, as they can follow the music very well.
Seyyed Payman Haqiqi, Roshana's father, said in an interview with an ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) journalist in Kermanshah,“ Roshana became familiar with the sound of the Tanbur( a Persian long necked string musical instrument) at home right from early days. This led them to pick it up and begin to play, from the age of 2. Them mother and I always encouraged her, and thankfully they were also a talented learner. In a short time, they learnt how to play it.”
Masters Hessamedin Seraj and Hazhir Mehrafrouz are their favorite singers, and they have souvenir photos with both of them. Now, they are preparing for their first public performance – the opening of Kermanshah Fajr Music Festival.
Roshana Sadat Haqiqi was born into a music-loving family on 25th January 2013, and, as their father claims, from their early days they would fall asleep to the sound of the Tanbur. From this passion, they began playing the Tanbur at the young age of 2.
Before they were born, their father made them a little Tanbur, and today, Roshana uses the very same instrument to practice, sitting next to their father.

I thought I would share it with you. ENJOY!
A couple of days ago, Buzzfeed put out a charming little video called “Video Stores Explained to Modern Kids.” In it, a soft-voiced narrator patiently explains how, once upon a time, we had to leave our houses to get physical copies of movies, wandering the shelves and picking from their finite selection of movies, which we'd then watch together because “this was before there was a screen in everyone's pocket,” and then you had to leave your house again to return it.
The short's warm glow of nostalgia softens the lesser aspects of the video store experience (late fees, limited selection, schmuck clerks), but it's nonetheless an effective reminder of what at-home movie consumption used to be, before Netflix's DVD-by-mail service put most of America's video stores clean out of business. The trouble is, that service is looking more and more likely to be phased out by Netflix's own streaming arm — and that's cause for alarm if you're concerned about the limitations of online streaming.
Netflix just capped off a very good third quarter, and when its CEO, Reed Hastings, discussed the company's progress and outlook, it became clear that they've got plenty of irons in the fire: original movies, more original programs, worldwide expansion, etc. But they had little to nothing to say about what, at least back in the day, was ostensibly Netflix's primary function: sending movies to your house in little red envelopes.
There's a reason for that. Their impressive third-quarter earning report, aside from showing a healthy increase in profits and a surpassing of HBO in total subscribers, indicates that all of the company's growth is happening in streaming. The Dissolve points us to this post by Giagom's Janko Roettergs, who notes several factors leading to “the slow but inevitable decline of Netflix's DVD business.” The streaming service has roughly 30 million subscribers; the DVD-by-mail version only has seven million, and that number has fallen by 50% in the past two years. The company has closed something like 20 of its distribution centers. Most importantly, the streaming service has exceeded the DVD arm in profitability. Add in a postal rate increase come January, and a shuttering of the physical DVD wing seems more and more likely.
It's not the first time we've been down this road. Two years back, after a rate hike prompted a mass exodus of subscribers, the company attempted to separate its two divisions into two standalone companies: Netflix for streaming, “Qwikster” for physical media. The whole thing was a disaster, retracted before it could even begin, but it was evident from that point on that physical media was the redheaded stepchild of the Netflix family — and faced with that rate hike, the majority of subscribers chose to lop off the mailer option and stick with the cheap, easy streaming. When contracts with several providers expired on the same day this year (quickly dubbed “Streamageddon”), the company insisted that it wasn't a big deal, since they weren't a one-stop shop, but content curators: “Our goal is to be an expert programmer, offering a mix that delights our members, rather than trying to be a broad distributor.”
That's a worrisome proposition, because even with DVDs still available by mail, that delightful mix is already impacting film consumption. Anne Helen Peterson, writing for LARB, despaired that Netflix is creating a “new canon” among young television viewers: “[A]s far as I can tell, the general sentiment goes something like this: if it's not on Netflix, why bother?” The limited options for film viewers, particularly those looking for obscure or classic titles, are even more troubling. Like it or not, Netflix has positioned itself as the primary delivery system for at-home movie watching, and contrary to its claims, the company isn't an “expert programmer”; it offers up whatever it can get from the content providers it has agreements with, and (like Blockbuster before it), Netflix is more interested in what's new and hot than what's old and good.
Don't believe me? According to the fine folks at GoWatchIt, of the top 15 titles on the American Film Institute's 2007 list of the best American movies, exactly none are currently streaming on Netflix. Among other subscription services, only one movie (Casablanca) is streaming free for Amazon Prime members; only one (City Lights) is available on Hulu Plus. Several others are available as á la carte rentals from iTunes, Amazon, and the like — and two titles (Raging Bull and Star Wars) aren't even available via that method.
In other words, they're only available via good old-fashioned physical media, and we're in too much of a hurry to free ourselves of things you can hold in your hand when the alternatives aren't yet ready for prime time. This is not some curmudgeonly old man talking; all appearances to the contrary, I love my Netflix streaming. But it's ephemeral. Movies come and go from there willy-nilly, and it's always been some small comfort to know that if I got an itch to watch some dopey ‘80s comedy that I didn't wanna blow $20 on owning, I could throw it in the queue and see it a couple of days later. Of course, there was a time where I could just hop in my car, go down to the Blockbuster, and grab it there. Netflix helped put those folks out of business. But if they do the same to their own by-mail service, making giant chunks of cinema vulnerable to the whims of their own package deals and profit reports, they'll be doing a genuine disservice to film history itself.
Leopard announced on Monday that RadioShack and Nissan are joining the Leopard Trek WorldTour team as sponsors for the 2012 and 2013 seasons. Leopard will continue to hold its existing UCI WorldTour License and the team will be re-branded as RadioShack-Nissan-Trek Professional Cycling Team as of next year.

Becca confirms Nygaard's departure from Leopard Trek
"As we stated in January, 2011 would be our apprentice-year," said Team Leopard owner Flavio Becca in a press release. "We intend to improve upon our results. In modern cycling you cannot move forward without strong sponsors.
"It is in this respect that today is a further milestone in the development of this exciting young project, which has gained the trust of two well-established players in the world of professional cycling. I continue to believe in the bright future of our athletes and have high expectations for the performance of this team. This is a major strategic move for all partners involved."
Time trial world champion Fabian Cancellara as well as Andy and Fränk Schleck will continue to lead the team in its plans for the 2012 and 2013 seasons. While the complete roster has not been announced, they will be joined by Amgen Tour of California champion Chris Horner, two-time Tour de France runner-up Andreas Klöden, Haimar Zubeldia, and national champions Matthew Busche, Jani Brajkovic, Nelson Oliveira and neo-pros Jesse Sergent and Ben King from RadioShack as well as Robert Wagner, Jakob Fuglsang and Daniele Bennati from Leopard Trek. The team will continue to be based in Luxembourg. Further details in regards to staffing and rosters will be announced on September 15.
In a statement later released by RadioShack, it was confirmed that the team will hold a license in with all marketing operations coming out of Austin, Texas by CSE Pro Cycling LLC, with all sporting operations managed by Johan Bruyneel Sports Management in both Belgium and Luxembourg.
"With our sponsors' continuing commitment and the professionalism of our riders, I'm confident that RadioShack-Nissan-Trek will dominate cycling for years to come," said Johan Bruyneel in the statement. "With Team RadioShack, we won 30 races and dominated the most important American races in 2011. Now thanks to the presence of riders like Fabian Cancellara and the Schleck brothers, we have the potential to win not only Classics and major stage races but Grand Tours as well. We will form a team of 30 riders, in regulation with the UCI rules. All contracts with riders and staff that are already signed with Team Leopard-Trek or Team RadioShack will be respected. We are grateful our sponsors believe in this project. This is a great milestone for our team and our global sport."
Meantime, RadioShack's arrangement with Lance Armstrong's cancer charity Livestrong will continue with RadioShack-Nissan-Trek.

Robin Soderling retires from tennis after battling glandular fever for four years
Sweden's Robin Soderling, the player best known for being the first man to beat Rafael Nadal at the French Open, has retired from professional tennis because of a long-running illness.
The 31-year-old, twice a runner-up at Roland Garros, had not played an ATP World Tour event since 2011 after contracting infectious mononucleosis, a viral illness also known as glandular fever.

“I've realised that I will not be healthy enough to be able to play tennis at the level I demand of myself,” Soderling told tennis.se.
“For that reason I have decided to end my career as a professional tennis player.”
“Thank you so much for all your kind words. So sad I won't play professional tennis again, but reading all your messages makes me feel a lot better,” Soderling said later on their Twitter account.

Soderling spent 10 years on the Tour and rose to world number four. In 2009 they ended Nadal's domination in Paris with a stunning victory in the fourth round, only to lose to Roger Federer in the final. Until Novak Djokovic defeated Nadal in the 2015 quarter-finals, Soderling was the only player to have beaten the Spaniard at Roland Garros.
Soderling, who won 10 career titles including the 2010 Paris Masters, returned to the final at Roland Garros in 2010, losing in straight sets to Nadal. They won the 2011 Swedish Open shortly before being diagnosed with glandular fever – meaning that the final, where they defeated David Ferrer, proved to be the last Tour match of their career.
WATCH: While travelling with Prime Minister Stephen Harper to Iraq and Kuwait over the weekend, the media was asked not to show the faces of Canadian soldiers in the crowd. But some of those same faces showed up online, in a promotional video created by the Prime Minister's Office. Vassy Kapelos was on that trip and has the story.
The Conservative government inappropriately published photos of Canadian soldiers posted in Iraq, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's communications director said Tuesday afternoon.
The images in question, included in Harper's video blog series called 24/7, were believed to show too clearly the faces of some of the country's special forces soldiers taking part in the anti-ISIS mission.
As a result, the government is reviewing the protocol for publishing images and videos of Canadian troops, said Rob Nicol, Harper's director of communications.
“The safety of our troops is our number one priority. For this reason, there are protocols in place before images or videos are posted,” they said in a written statement. “We regret the error and are reviewing protocols for such images.”
WATCH: MP James Bezan apologized for videos that were posted to PM Stephen Harper's “24/7″ website showing Canadian soldiers faces during their trip to Iraq and Kuwait.
The images were taken during the prime minister's recent surprise trip to Iraq and Kuwait.
Members of the media accompanying Harper were told to not show the faces of any Canadian soldier for fear of retaliation from ISIS.
While no media seem to have broken the government's rule, the videos on Harper's 24/7 website appear to.
One video, shot in Kuwait, shows Defence Minister Jason Kenney discussing the trip while soldiers roam about behind him.
In another — a narrated piece showing the prime minister meeting with soldiers and getting a tour of Canada's advise and assist mission — includes the profile of what appears to be a member of JTF2, the most elite and secretive force in the Canadian military.
Canadian media were repeatedly told that showing anything involving JTF2 forces or any soldiers based in Kuwait or Iraq would directly put soldiers in danger; media were told ISIS could use the images to target the Canadian Forces members and their families.
A government spokesperson speaking on background initially said the videos were pre-cleared for use by National Defence.
They said that although DND raised no objections, the videos were abruptly pulled offline out of an abundance of caution when concerns arose Tuesday.
At the time, the spokesperson said the intention was to repost the videos as-is with no changes; a few hours later, though, it became clear the images broke protocol.
“When concerns were raised about a few specific images, these were taken down immediately so we could review that the protocols were applied properly,” Nicol said. “After a second review, it became apparent that two of the videos should not have been posted.”

Video from the Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, NY.
April, a 15-year-old giraffe, gave birth to their fourth calf, a healthy boy, on April 15.
The nation waited for weeks with bated breath anticipating the calf's arrival. Thousands have watched the live feed from their pen on this site alone -- over 1.2 million more watched the YouTube stream of the calf's birth.
In the days since the birth, people have still been tuning in to watch the baby interact with their mom.
Just days after the live video launched in February, Animal Adventure Park posted to their Facebook page that the stream was suspended for "nudity & sexual content." They said "Animal Rights Extremists" were responsible.
A new live feed was created later and streaming resumed. The zoo periodically puts up a new feed on its YouTube page. Watch the current stream in the video player above or on Animal Adventure Park's YouTube channel.

Apple's new iPad has helped to define the broader tablet market, even though it has yet to ship, according to research firm ABI Research. The firm said Tuesday that shipments of tablet devices - defined as touchscreen interface devices measuring five to eleven inches with WiFi, video and gaming capabilities, will measure four million units in 2010, and rise to 57 million units by 2015, prodded along by the iPad.
"Apple's iPad is not the first media tablet," senior ABI Research analyst Jeff Orr said in a statement. "But it does help define this new device category."
According to the firm, the main focus of tablet devices will be for entertainment, and they said they will not replace laptops, netbooks, or mobile phones. In addition, ABI said that it believes tablets will remain a, "premium or luxury product for wealthy industrialized markets for at least several years."
The firm also believes that the iPad will help offer other tablet makers, especially smaller companies trying to bring new devices to market, exposure that could boost their sales.
"New entrants to this market are at a disadvantage since they lack the retail relationships and network operator agreements already built by the more mature vendors," Mr. Orr said. "Surprisingly, Apple may have done them a favor by raising the public profile of the whole media tablet category."
Jeff Gamet and this reporter discussed similar ideas in the most recent episode of The Apple Context Machine podcast, published over the weekend. Our comparison was to the boost that Apple gave USB with the introduction of the USB-only iMac.
USB had been around for some time before the iMac, but did not explode in after the iMac's release, when electronics vendors rushed a barrage of USB devices onto the market. ABI's research suggests that iPad could have a similar effect on the tablet market, boosting awareness of and exposure to competing devices.
When epidemiologists at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health recently recalculated cervical cancer mortality rates, they found that black women were nearly twice as likely to die from the disease as we previously thought. What's more, the researchers found that black women die from cervical cancer at rates more than double those of white women—a gap that is also twice as large as earlier estimates.
The study revealed that, among black women, there are 10.1 cervical cancer deaths per every 100,000 individuals—versus just 4.7 per 100,000 white women. Previously, these figures were believed to be 5.7 and 3.2, respectively.

It's hardly a secret that socioeconomic status and racial discrimination greatly impact patients' health outcomes in the United States. Low-income patients with diabetes are 10 times more likely to undergo limb amputation than affluent ones, black women are 41% more likely than white women to die from breast cancer, and even though African Americans are more likely to have elevated blood pressure than white Americans, they are 10% less likely to be screened for high cholesterol. The list goes on.
But what makes the recalculated cervical cancer death rates stand out is that the disease is preventable as long as it is detected early and treated appropriately. The low fatality rates among white women by and large reflect that fact. Black women, however, die from cervical cancer at rates comparable to those in sub-Saharan Africa.
One of the factors behind the disparity is that black patients face inferior access to quality detection services and follow-up care (the root cause of which is, of course, racial discrimination). Another recent study of patients with advanced-stage cervical cancer found that a majority received substandard care, and that those patients were more likely to be black and low-income.
How do we get adequate preventive care to all people?
As Dr. Otis W. Brawley, the Chief Medical Officer for the American Cancer Society, said in response to the Johns Hopkins study, “When we look at the difference between black and white, and rich and poor, we find the same disparity. The quality of assessment and follow-up treatment can be the difference. The question becomes: How do we get adequate preventive care to all people?”
But unlike the medical community, whose goal is to expand care, Congressional Republicans' relentless attacks on the Affordable Care Act and Planned Parenthood will dramatically reduce it—and worsen the racial disparities that have killed so many black women.
The Affordable Care Act mandated coverage of cervical cancer detection services—along with all preventive care—at no cost to the patient. But the Republican-controlled Congress and White House have already taken steps to dismantle the ACA, and the fate of preventive care is uncertain as a result. (Conversations between House and Senate Republicans reveal that there is no consensus around how best to replace the healthcare law.) If racial disparities in cervical cancer death rates boil down to unequal access to quality detection services and subsequent treatment, then patients who struggle to afford care are bound to be worse off under repeal.
The proposal to roll back the Medicaid expansion, backed by many Congressional Republicans, threatens to strip coverage—and thereby the ability to obtain detection services and treatment—from the patients who arguably need it the most. Some 11 million low-income individuals will lose access to Medicaid under this proposal, and black women are more likely to be affected. Moreover, the proposal to turn Medicaid into a block grant will cut between 14 million and 20 million patients from the health insurance program.
Furthermore, Congressional Republicans continue to target Planned Parenthood, a core provider of reproductive and sexual health services—cervical cancer detection included. If they defund Planned Parenthood, the health care provider will be stripped of more than one-third of its budget. Low-income women and women of color, who are disproportionately represented among its patients, will likely suffer worse medical outcomes as a result. And if Congressional Republicans follow through with plans to slash Title X—the nation's only federal source of funds for reproductive health clinics—patients will find cervical cancer detection services (and other vital healthcare) even further out of reach.
Racial disparities in medical outcomes are completely avoidable—particularly when the disease in question is as preventable as cervical cancer. While the medical community rallies to address these differences in mortality rates, efforts to rectify them will only be stymied by Congressional Republicans. But the cost, in this case, is people's lives.
When Gavin Verhey was eleven, they dreamt of a job making Magic cards—and now as a Magic designer, he's living their dream! Gavin has been writing about Magic since 2005.
All right. So you're feeling ready to play competitively. You've spotted a deck you like. There's just one issue: you don't quite have all of the cards you need yet.
What do you do? What are your options?
In my ten-plus years of writing about Magic, one of the most popular questions I'm asked is this: "How can I win on a budget?"
First let's define what we mean by "budget." For this article, what we're talking about when we discuss budget is card availability. Rares are more difficult to acquire than uncommons, and mythic rares are more difficult to acquire than rares.
The good news is that it is definitely doable in today's world. You just have to be methodical and figure out what you want to build.
So, how can you win on a budget? Today, let's answer that question!
1. Decide Which Deck You Want to Build
This may sound simple, but it really is a very important step! The very first thing you should do is identify which deck you'd like to play. I've seen too many people just flail their arms about like some kind of wacky inflatable-arm tube-man, trading for a scattershot of Standard cards, hoping that somehow suddenly all Standard will become available to them.
Building on a budget is, just like Magic, a game of resources. When trading cards, for example, you only have so many cards you can trade away—so you should have a target in mind for what you want to build.
And with that target comes realistic expectations for what you can build using your card pool. For example, if you're looking over the Top 8 decklists from the most recent Pro Tour and there are three decks you are interested in playing, and you have half the cards for one of them but almost none for the other two, then it's going to be much easier to start going in the direction of the deck you have more of.
Just for an example to continue with for the rest of this article, let's say we settle on Luis Scott-Vargas's Black-Green Aristocrats deck.
Okay. So you've chosen your deck. Perhaps you've read a little bit on how it works, so you can begin to understand what it does and make sure it's the deck for you.
What's next?
2. Identify What's Irreplaceable
Building on a budget is one thing. Building a winning deck on a budget is another.
Our goal should still be to build as competitive a deck as possible despite our budget constraints. And while this may involve a couple of very slight downgrades or moving sideways on a few cards, there's one thing that is very important: acquiring the irreplaceable cards.
Some decks have integral pieces that there aren't good substitutes for, and, in this budget deck-building game of resources, those are the pieces you should be spending your time and energy trying to acquire.
As an example, let's look at the three nonland main-deck rares and mythic rares in the asupervisorstioned Black-Green Aristocrats deck from earlier. (I'll talk about lands and sideboards in a little bit.)
Okay, let's go through each. For each, you should be asking yourself two questions: Is this crucial to the deck, and is there a possible replacement?
Collected Company is a Standard staple, and a very powerful card. There's nothing else that even comes close to its power in putting a bunch of creatures on the battlefield. It's also very important for the deck's game plan, since it provides you a bunch of creatures at instant speed. This is one you should really try and acquire.
Cryptolith Rite there definitely isn't a replacement for. There's no other card in Standard that does something like what it does. Is it crucial? Well, it's pretty important—though the deck certainly functions fine without it. I would play them if I had them, and I would try and get them, but they are a much lower priority than the Collected Companys. If you don't have them yet, you can still be okay.
Liliana, Heretical Healer is not crucial to the deck, and you could play a different three-drop in its place. While you should certainly use them if you have them, if you substitute a different three-drop card like Fleshbag Marauder or Tireless Tracker, you'd still be in fine shape. It's maybe not 100% optimal, but it's more of a sideways move than a downgrade.
The best way to identify how important a card might be is definitely to think about how the deck plays and watch it be played. However, if you're looking for a quick way to identify a card's importance, a good rule of thumb is to check how many copies are in the deck. That's a good indicator of how important the deck's designer thought it was to draw.
Now, this is far from a perfect metric. Plenty of powerful, necessary cards get played with fewer than four copies, such as legendary creatures, individual tutor targets (just try playing the Seasons Past decks without the two copies of its namesake card!), and so on. But it's a great indicator to factor into your analysis.
3. Delve into the Mana Base
While the flashy spells tend to get all of the credit while you're playing, perhaps the most crucial part of a deck is actually its mana base.
Your lands help make sure that all of your spells do their thing effectively and on time. Your entire deck can crumble without the right lands.
It's for this reason that I always recommend trying to pick up the dual lands for each set as they come out over most everything else, because you're going to get more use out of them than practically anything else. If you're building a blue-white deck, and it's anytime during the eighteen-month period that Shadows over Innistrad is legal, you're almost certainly going to be putting Port Town in your deck.
With that said, sometimes you just don't have what you fully need to make your deck work. Maybe, for example, you have some of the dual lands you need but not all of them.
In these cases, I would look at what substitutes are available in the format. For example, great ones are the uncommon lands featured in Oath of the Gatewatch and Shadows over Innistrad. Sure, Hissing Quagmire gives you the option of becoming a creature—but in many, many games, Foul Orchard will be just as good. You should try to upgrade to the Quagmire over time, but the Orchard will do the job totally reasonably for now.
Going back to our example decklist, I could totally see swapping in Foul Orchard and Evolving Wilds for the rare dual lands.
The one that's a little harder to replace is actually Westvale Abbey. This oddball rare land becomes a gigantic threatening creature. It's not absolutely crucial for the deck, but it is definitely strong and provides an effect that's hard to find elsewhere. I would try and acquire these if you can, but you can substitute basics for now if you need to.
One final note on this: sometimes there will be decks with very complex mana bases that sport three or more colors. I would be very careful trying to play these kinds of decks without the proper mana bases for them. There are only so many substitutions you can make before the deck starts to fall apart, and all of the power in playing cards across so many colors is negated by a much weaker mana base. It's something to keep an eye on while building.
4. Find the Right Replacements
So you've identified which deck you want to play and which cards you should prioritize acquiring, and ensured your mana base can work. What's next?
It's time to figure out which replacements to put into your deck!
Ideally, you want to be making substitutions that move sideways—meaning that the cards you are putting in are still fine cards to play, they're just better in some different situations and worse in some other different situations. You want to try and look for similar effects. For example, if you don't have Ruinous Path, Ultimate Price might do just as good of a job (or occasionally better!).
But sometimes there just aren't clear-cut exchanges you can make. In that case, one of the first places I always like to look at for inspiration is the original deck's sideboard.
Sideboards are generally full of two classes of cards: hate cards for specific decks, and cards that are specifically best against an entire class of decks. For example, Virulent Plague is only good against token decks, whereas something like Transgress the Mind or Ultimate Price is best against certain strategies but still plenty effective against a wide swath of decks. It's usually pretty safe to look toward those as a solution.
Similarly, you can look at cards that had fewer than four copies in the main deck and up those further. Clearly they were strong enough for the main deck to draw sometimes, so playing a third or fourth copy of a card that's already there is generally a pretty safe choice. In another close vein, you can play cards that are similar to cards the deck is already playing. Carrier Thrall could be a perfectly good fit for the Aristocrats deck.
Another great way to look for substitutions is to look for cards in the same mana cost slot. Often, it's very important that a deck's curve stays the same. When replacing, I would usually be reticent to go up in curve—so I would look for cards that cost the same amount or less.
5. Don't Forget About the Sideboard
It's easy to leave your sideboard by the wayside and figure it's not as important as the main deck, but you have to be careful. After all, keep in mind that you will play more games post-sideboarded than pre-sideboarded in a tournament!
What's important when building a sideboard for a budget deck is that you adjust your sideboard to accommodate any gaps your main deck tweaks leave behind.
Going back to our Black-Green Aristocrats deck, let's say you have to remove Liliana. Well, suddenly you're down a source of inevitability and card advantage. As a result, maybe you want your sideboard to have an enchantment like Evolutionary Leap or another planeswalker to compensate. In a pinch, you could even use Read the Bones to help fill that gap.
If you have to cut cards from your sideboard and need to replace them, think about the role that card was trying to fill. If you have to cut Tireless Tracker because you don't have them, try and find another source of card advantage. If you don't have Transgressed the Mind, look for another discard spell—and so on.
Budgeting for Victory
Winning on a budget is perfectly doable—it just requires careful planning. If you follow this process, you should be able to find a deck you can reasonably build and make it your own, and then over time evolve it into the form you find best. Besides, who knows what you might discover: many times I've actually found incredible cards to play when trying to build on a budget that actually end up being better than the cards I didn't have!
Here's my version of the budget Aristocrats deck I worked on throughout this article. The final version sports only eight total rares and no mythic rares across the entire main deck and sideboard!
Feel free to take this deck and go out to do battle. Or, better yet, follow the steps above to create your own budget take on a powerful Standard deck.

Step-by-step directions for home distilling:
The process for distilling alcohol for fuel is similar for distilling moonshine. The difference is that the two processes have a different philosophy behind them. Moonshine is made for taste. As such, the process focuses on optimizing and perfecting recipes, aging, ingredients, and yeast. The philosophy behind fuel is that you want the highest concentration of alcohol that is possible. In many states it is illegal to distill alcohol for consumption. However, they are much more lenient when it comes to making fuel.
There are many uses for alcohol besides fuel. However, the most important thing to consider is safety. Alcohol is a highly flammable substance. As such, it's of the utmost importance that you practice sound judgment and distill your alcohol in a safe environment.
The process for distilling alcohol is rather simple. Alcohol is produced by yeast which consumes sugar and converts it into alcohol. After a week or so, you will have anywhere from 5% to 20% alcohol by volume (ABV), the higher the concentration of alcohol the better.
You will then want to distill your alcohol in order to get a higher concentration. The distillation process is rather simple and easy to do. Distilling alcohol is the process of separating the alcohol from the water. Alcohol evaporates at a lower temperature than water. When heated, the alcohol will evaporate first. The vaporized alcohol will rise up a column into a condenser. A condenser simply cools the vaporized alcohol so that is condenses back into a liquid. The condenser is a tube of metal that is cooled by cold water that flows over and around it.
There are several different kinds of stills. The two most popular are a pot still and a column still. A pot still is typically used for making moonshine, whiskey, and rum. Whereas a column still is most often used for making vodka and fuel. The reason for this is that a pot still has a shorter column. This this means that the vaporized alcohol has to travel a shorter distance up to the condenser. Alcohol produced from a pot still typically comes out at a lower concentration than alcohol produced from a column still. The advantage being that alcohol produced from pot still carries more flavors from the grain.
Alcohol produced from a column still comes out at a higher concentration. This is due to that fact that it must travel a greater distance up the column. The steam that is produced when distilling is a combination of both alcohol and water (higher concentration of alcohol). As previously mentioned, water evaporates at a lower temperature. As such, as the steam rises up the column, the water molecules will condense faster than the alcohol and drip back down into the still.
What you will need: For this process you will need a still, yeast, sugar, and a fermentation vessel. The larger your still and fermentation vessel, the more alcohol you can produce. You will also want to use a distiller's yeast that can produce the most amount of alcohol.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ed Miliband: "Banks seem to carry on almost as if the crisis never happened"
Labour leader Ed Miliband has said banks must not be isolated from the rest of UK society and must end a "culture of excessive bonuses".
In a speech they called for "one nation" banks, serving every region, business and family.
They said banking was at a crossroads after rows over bonuses and a decision to rescind Fred Goodwin's knighthood.
Tory MP Matthew Hancock said Mr Miliband "refused to accept their part in the economic mess Labour created".
Mr Miliband's speech, in London's financial district Canary Wharf, said calls for action were driven not by "the politics of envy" but the need for "values of fairness".
Their comments come at the end of a week in which RBS boss Stephen Hester waived a £963,000 share-only bonus amid political anger and their predecessor at RBS, Mr Goodwin, was stripped of their knighthood.
'Culture of responsibility'
The Labour leader argued that the debate must not be confined to individual cases but focus on the wider issue of the role of banking in economy and society.
"This is about more than one man, one bonus, or one knighthood," they said.
This is a call on banking to recognise that it should take the path of change. Ed Miliband, Labour leader
"It is not about the politics of envy. It is about a culture of responsibility. We need what you might call 'one nation banking'. We need banks that serve the real economy. We need banking serving every region, every sector, every business, every family in this country."
Banks have played a valuable role in the past in promoting enterprise, helping new industries develop and old ones restructure, Mr Miliband said.
However, they said that bank lending fell £10.8bn last year and that if the industry "continues on its current path" it risks becoming "further isolated" from society and provoking greater "public anger".
"This is a call on banking to recognise it has reached a crossroads. This is a call on banking to recognise that it should take the path of change."
They also said banks had accepted "they bear the burden of responsibility for helping to cause the crisis".
"The consequences of their reckless irresponsibility in that era are felt every time a library closes, every time a school can't afford a new book and every time a police officer or police officer is taken off the beat."
'Emotional' language
The Lord Mayor of the City of London, David Wootton, told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme they agreed with some of the points raised by Mr Miliband, but called for a "calm debate".
"Language of an emotional nature, I think, is useful in some respects but we do need a calm, rational debate. The banking sector has indeed accepted a degree of responsibility but others were responsible too," they said.
Until Ed Miliband admits Labour's past mistakes, the public won't take their party seriously Matthew Hancock, Conservative MP
The term "one nation Conservatism" has traditionally been used by Tories who regard social justice and equality as as much of a priority as economic freedom and opportunity.
Mr Miliband said Labour intended to press ahead with a Commons debate and vote on City bonuses tabled in the wake of the row over Mr Hester's bonus.
But Conservative MP Matthew Hancock, who was Chancellor George Osborne's chief of staff when the party was in opposition, said: "This is just more empty rhetoric from a weak Labour leader.
"Ed Miliband calls for responsibility from bankers but has refused to accept their part in the economic mess Labour created."
They added: "Until Ed Miliband admits Labour's past mistakes, the public won't take their party seriously."
The government has said that its package of reforms will ensure banks have to publish more details about what their top earners are being paid, as well as giving shareholders binding votes on pay.
The Institute of Directors and other City groups have warned that the recent outcry over bonus awards and Fred Goodwin being stripped of their honour risk creating "anti-business hysteria".
English shmenglish. Language shmanguage. The practice of copying a word and sticking a shm- onto it came into the U.S. with Yiddish speakers in the late 19th century, and by the 1930s it had spread into general use. It's a handy way of downplaying or dismissing something without being too aggressive or unfriendly. With shm- you can be simultaneously grumpy and cute. The rules of shm- reduplication are not taught in school, yet we have a pretty good feel for how it's done: repeat a word, putting a shm- before the vowel sound in the first syllable ("syllable, shmyllable!").
But there are some words that cause confusion about how the shm- should best be attached. A 2003 study by linguists Andrew Nevins and Bert Vaux (called, appropriately, "Metalinguistic, shmetalinguistic: the phonology of shm- reduplication") found five types of words that leave people fumbling to figure out where the shm- should go. The lack of consensus on how to handle these cases is not caused by random, ruleless anarchy, but by specific competing hypotheses about how shm- reduplication should interact with the structure of English words. They are rules in the making, not quite resolved. Here are five phonetic pitfalls of shm- reduplication.
1. Breakfast…shmreakfast?
The shm- goes before the vowel of the first syllable (apple, shmapple). If there's already a consonant in front of the first vowel, it replaces the first consonant (bagel, shmagel). But wait. What if there are two consonants in front of the vowel? Does the rule say to replace just the first consonant of the word, or everything before the vowel? Does the 'r' of "breakfast" stay or go? Some says stay (breakfast, shmreakfast); some says go (breakfast, shmeakfast). What's your take on "broom"? (Shmoom or shmroom?) Does "floss" keep the 'l'? (Shmoss or shmloss?)
2. Union…shmyoonion?
Some words start with a vowel-like 'y' or 'w' sound, called a glide. Is it part of the vowel peak of the syllable? In that case we get "shmyoonion." Or is it the consonant before the vowel, to be replaced, yielding "shmoonion"?
3. Witches…smitches?
A number of participants in the study replaced the "shm-" with a simpler "sm-" when the word contained a "ch" or another "sh." (Rich, smich. Ishmael, smishmael.) For them, all that shushing and chushing is apparently just too much, and they compensate by lessening the noisy load.
4. Obscene…obshmene?
Generally, the shm- likes to attach to a stressed syllable. To conform to this preference, people will sometimes move the word stress to the first syllable: arCADE -> ARcade, SHMARcade. But sometimes, they let the shm- wander into the middle of the word to find the stressed syllable. Is it "obscene, shmobscene" or "obscene, obshmene?" "Confusion, shmonfusion" or "confusion, conshmusion"? Do you let your shm- wander, or make it stay up front where you can keep an eye on it?
5. Schmooze…shnooze?
What to do when you want to use shm- reduplication on a word that already starts with "shm"? A very small number will forge ahead with "schmooze, schmooze," but most will simply decline to try at all. Still, about 20 to 30 percent will go with an alternative like "shnooze," "schlooze," "shmemooze," "wooze," or the semantically similar and always very useful "my ass."
(CNN) -- The CEO of GoDaddy.com on Friday defended an online video that shows them shooting and killing an elephant in Zimbabwe.
"It takes a guy like me" to protect villagers' crops from rogue elephants, they said.
Bob Parsons, founder of the Scottsdale, Arizona-based web-hosting service, posted the graphic video on their Twitter account on March 14. The footage, shot March 8, shows them hunting an elephant on a farm and posing with a shotgun beside its corpse.
Then, it shows locals crowding around the dead animal and cutting off pieces of its meat.
Parsons said they killed the animal for the good of local farmers whose crops are often destroyed by elephants.
"They would say 'please come back,' " they said, arguing the measure is an effective way to protect crops and feed hungry local residents.
The video shows them walking through a field of flattened sorghum plants, which they said had been crushed by roaming elephants.
The reason they posted the video, Parsons said, is because they want "people to know what goes on over there."
"There were people who walked 25 miles to get to that elephant," they said, referencing a food crisis that has often plagued developing countries.
But critics call their methods extreme.
The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals initiated an online boycott of GoDaddy.com and its services until Parsons "stops shooting animals," according to the organization's website.
Parsons' own website has also been inundated by negative comments about the video.
"A lot of the people who are upset about this are animal lovers," Parsons said. "Their heart is in the right place but they just don't understand the situation."
They called the fact that the elephant meat provided food for the people "a bonus."
"They literally have nothing and they're on the brink of starvation," they said.
Parsons has traveled to Zimbabwe for several years, but only last year began hunting elephants at the request of local farmers, they said.
Elephant experts say it is not illegal to kill rogue elephants in Zimbabwe.
Parsons said they have killed five elephants.
PETA rejected Parsons' explanation, with the organization's president, Ingrid Newkirk, releasing a statement saying, "If Bob Parsons really wanted to help African villagers, they would use their money to promote one of the many effective, nonlethal methods available to protect crops -- not act like a little boy with a gun."
In a press release, PETA said it is pulling its business from GoDaddy.com, and the group labeled Parsons "Scummiest CEO of the Year."
Meanwhile, asked if the PETA boycott had affected GoDaddy.com's business, company spokesperson Elizabeth Driscoll said, "There has been no significant change in business."

Wherever you find yourself in the city, there is probably an outdoor chess table nearby. According to the parks department, there are more than 2,000 public chess or checkers tables spread among 536 parks, offering the perfect spot to sacrifice a queen or promote a pawn.
Unless, apparently, the chess tables are in a playground.
Seven chess players in Upper Manhattan found this out the hard way, when police officers approached them at the stone chess tables in Inwood Hill Park and issued them summonses for failure to comply with signs.
The tables are behind the gates of the park's Emerson Playground, which the signs in question state is off limits to adults unaccompanied by minors.
Similar signs are posted at most if not all parks department playgrounds to deter what a parks official called “inappropriate adult use of space designated specifically for children.”
But given that the overwhelming majority of users of public chess boards are adults and what seems to be the generally nonthreatening nature of the chess players, members of the Inwood Hill Seven wondered about the logic behind the crackdown, which took place Oct. 20 and was reported by the online Manhattan news site DNAInfo on Wednesday.
“What is so harmful with chess?” asked Yacahudah Harrison, 49, a homeless man who said they and four other men were playing at the tables around lunchtime when three police cruisers drove into the park. “It's a quiet game, but it still disturbs the peace.”
Mr. Harrison, a white-bearded man with a personality reminiscent of Santa Claus, said they began playing chess in the park two years ago after a neighborhood resident who saw them playing in the 207th Street subway station invited them to come to the park to teach the game to children.
“From what I know, chess is accepted as good culture in every culture,” they said. “We drink jasmine tea and have some muffins, nothing decadent.” The police, they said, “rolled up on us like we were big-time drug dealers.” The tables are separated from the rest of the play area by a fence. Mr. Harrison said there were no children present at the time.
Mr. Harrison and their co-defendants are charged with violating a provision of parks regulation 1-03 formally known as “Failure to Comply With Directions of Police Officers, Urban Park Rangers, Parks Enforcement Patrol Officers, or Other Department Employees, or Park Signs.” It carries a $50 fine. They must go to court on the matter on or before Dec. 28.
While the park does have its share of drug dealing and other illicit activity, supporters of the chess players say that the police are going after the wrong people.
“This incident is an embarrassment to the officers from the 34th Precinct who felt that it was necessary to use their badge and authority to issue such a random summons,” Joanna Johnston, who said that their 7-year-old son learned to play chess from the men in the playground, wrote in a letter to the police and the mayor.
But the 34th Precinct's commanding officer, Capt. Jose Navarro, told DNAInfo that they had reviewed the summonses and stood by them. And a police spokesperson said that the summonses were part of a larger campaign to clean up the park, driven by complaints from residents about crime.
“There's been an effort over time to address these concerns, and a lot of it begins with very simple innocuous violations such as this,” the spokesperson said.
Mr. Harrison said that none of the chess players had returned to the playground since the incident.
“We're not looking for trouble,” they said. “We're not lawbreakers.”

Dr. Javad Peirovy sexually abused four female patients in the span of one year at a walk-in clinic, leaving them “traumatized” — the word used by a discipline panel of Ontario's medical watchdog. On Wednesday, that same panel decided that Peirovy was fit to keep their licence. Instead of revoking it, they suspended him. In six months, the Toronto doctor will be back at work.
The College of Physicians and Surgeons took the unusual step of expressing "disappointment" over a decision made by its own disciplinary panel this week. ( CARLOS OSORIO / TORONTO STAR )
The College of Physicians and Surgeons' lawyer had requested that the panel, which is independent of the college, revoke their licence. The college proposed last year that provincial legislation be amended so that “all physical sexual contact between a physician and patient” would lead to mandatory revocation. A provincial task force, created 16 months ago following a Star investigation into doctors still at work after sexually abusing their patients, is on the cusp of delivering a much-anticipated report to the government on the issue.
Article Continued Below
The college took the rare step of issuing a statement to the Star on Wednesday. “The College is disappointed in the discipline panel's decision not to revoke Dr. Peirovy's licence,” said college registrar Dr. Rocco Gerace. “Council supports revisions to the legislation that would require mandatory revocation in any case where physical sexual contact with a patient is proven to have occurred.” Current legislation makes revocation mandatory for nearly every other form of sexual abuse, including penetration, oral sex and masturbation. But sexual touching remains a grey area, and revocation is entirely at the discretion of the discipline committee panel hearing the case. “This has been my concern all along, and I see the college (discipline committee) refuses to act unless pushed specifically and directly by the government,” said medical malpractice lawyer Amani Oakley. “This (decision) is not a logical way to proceed when they themselves have recognized that this is sexual abuse.”
Peirovy was found guilty by the panel last July of “acts of professional misconduct in that they engaged in the sexual abuse” of four patients. In the case of two patients, Ms U and Ms V, they placed their stethoscope on their nipples and cupped their breasts. Regarding Ms W and Ms X, they touched their nipples when “there was no clinical reason” to examine the women in that way, the panel found.

They denied the allegations before the committee, and their lawyer, David Porter, declined to comment on Tuesday. Peirovy was also found to have demonstrated conduct that was “disgraceful, dishonourable or unprofessional” in telling a fifth patient that they could see each other socially.
Dr. Javen Peirovy is facing a six-month suspension. ( Toronto Police Service )
They pleaded guilty in criminal court in 2013 to two counts of simple assault, after being initially charged with sexually assaulting six female patients. They had earlier pleaded not guilty to sexual assault in those two cases, and the charges relating to the other four women were withdrawn by the Crown. Peirovy was given a conditional discharge and 18 months' probation and was ordered by the court to take counselling.  They are at low risk to reoffend and can practise on female patients safely in the presence of a female chaperone who must also be a health professional, found the four-member discipline panel, chaired by former CPSO president Dr. Marc Gabel, along with Drs. John Watts and Robert Sheppard and community member Diane Doherty. “To me, any physician who has deliberately sexually abused their patients should be subject to revocation. Full stop,” said medical malpractice lawyer Paul Harte. Gabel declined to comment through CPSO spokesperson Kathryn Clarke. “Decisions of the discipline committee stand on their own and reasons for the decision are provided in detail,” they said. Evidence presented at Peirovy's penalty hearing showed that “he is sincerely embarrassed at and ashamed of their actions, and that they never wants this to happen again,” the panel wrote in its 16-page decision. The members placed “substantive weight” on the expert evidence of a forensic psychiatrist, Dr. Jonathan Rootenberg, who is identified only as “Dr. M” in the decision. They found Peirovy is at a low risk to reoffend and he's “worked hard to understand their inappropriate behaviour” by also working with a medical professional who specializes in boundary issues. The committee accepted Dr. M's evidence that Peirovy can improve through professional training and counselling. “The rehabilitative needs of Dr. Peirovy have been addressed. Specific and general deterrence have also been served,” the panel wrote, also ordering Peirovy to pay $35,000 in costs. “The penalty, in the view of the committee, is consistent with similar penalties previously imposed by the discipline committee in similar cases.” The College has taken some action since the Star's 2013 investigation. It now posts more disciplinary information about doctors on its website, including whether physicians are facing criminal charges, and has said it will consider sharing more information with police. OTHER CASES Sammy Sliwin
Plastic surgeon Sammy Joe Sliwin lost their licence a year ago.
The prominent Toronto plastic surgeon lost their licence last year after a disciplinary panel found them guilty of professional misconduct for having sex with a patient who was also their lover.  They are appealing their revocation to Divisional Court, arguing that it violates their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  They are still practising pending that appeal. Bruce Minnes
Pediatrician Bruce Minnes lost their licence over sexual activity with a teenage girl.
The former Hospital for Sick Children emergency room pediatrician lost their licence last year after they were found to have engaged in “very instrusive and coercive sexual activities” with a 17-year-old girl who was not their patient. Their behaviour was “manipulative” and “predatory,” concluded a disciplinary panel. The incident took place at a summer camp when the girl was a camp counsellor and they were the camp physician. Minnes lost their appeal in Divisional Court. Sharif Tadros
Sharif Tadros was found to have groomed three patients for sexual activity.
The Burlington doctor was found to have sexually abused three of their patients and pressured them to drop complaints against him. They groomed the three over a 20-year period for sex, and two ended up with depression and anxiety, according to an agreed statement of fact filed at their discipline hearing. Eleazar Noriega
Eleazar Noriega lost their licence over sexual impropriety dating to 1979.
The Toronto pediatrician lost their licence last year after the discipline committee found they engaged in “sexual impropriety” with a patient in January 1979. The panel found they subjected the teenaged patient to “protracted sexual stimulation with him” at a health clinic. They only came forward in 2008 after seeing their name on television in relation to other professional misconduct allegations.
There's an often-quoted statistic that the ratio between the average incomes of the richest and poorest quintiles of Americans is 15 to 1. Earlier this year I stumbled over some research (“You Are What You Spend”) indicating that there is less to that difference than meets the eye. According to the authors, the difference in actual annual spending (as opposed to annual income) falls to 4:1, apparently because lots of people have sources of spendable cash that don't show up as annual income (asset sales, securities not subject to capital gains taxes, insurance policy redemptions, and so forth).
But it gets better. If you adjust for size of household, the consumption ratio between richest and poorest quintiles drops to 2.1:1. They note that the average person in the middle income quintile consumes just 29% more than the average person in the lowest quintile. American spending patterns look dramatically more egalitarian than the raw numbers on income distribution would suggest. What the heck is going on here?
On these numbers, it doesn't sound like being rich actually buys you a lot. OK, you get to save a lot of money for the future, while poor people live paycheck to paycheck and spend a significant fraction of their income on debt service. That's significant. There are other ways to quarrel with this analysis, too; averaging over quintiles arguably underweights inequality at the extreme top and bottom ends of the distribution.
Still, that 2.1:1 figure is pretty startling. That gives us a factor of 6 difference between income spread and consumption spread over at least 80% of the income distribution, which suggests that something is operating that drastically equalizes Americans' consumption power. And some other papers that I found by googling for “consumption inequality” actually back this up with different lines of evidence. The second and third I read noted that while U.S. wage inequality has increased significantly since 1970, consumption inequality has not. Both attribute this to the buffering effect of consumer credit on wage volatility.
I think the authors of “You Are What You Spend” are on to something more basic, though. There simply isn't much stuff left that is so expensive that rich people can buy it but poor people can't. This is true even for classic rich-person luxury goods. Proles buy wedding diamonds in strip malls. Caviar is no big deal; I know a woman who has carried it as backpack rations becuse the food-value-to-weight ratio was so good, which might sound like a rich-kid story until I tell you she's a calligrapher who makes a somewhat precarious living doing piecework. And I know a non-wealthy programmer who recently bought themselves an airplane.
More prosaically, look at what “poor” people have. Refrigerators. Cars. Televisions. Cell phones. Computers. I wrote about this in 2003 in an essay Mobilizing the Poor and Other Delusions. In that essay I was arguing that the goods consumption of all Americans above homeless drug addicts on the SES scale is so high as to make “poverty” a term that cannot meaningfully be applied in the U.S. Not if you've lived, as I have, in places where they have the real thing.
The data on consumption spreads demonstrate something else: not just that “poverty” is a silly word to use in the U.S., but that the degree of “inequality” we have here barely moves the needle off the peg on the historical misery meter.
The authors of “You Are What You Spend” explain this mainly by noticing that consumer goods have plummeted in price while rocketing in quality. Basically, everything is cheap now. Even with the recent spike in the price of oil, for example, Americans spend less on gasoline in constant dollars than they did in 1971. Food, clothing, housing, and other basics also cost drastically less than they did as recently as my teenage years, continuing a 150-year trend. Rates of home ownership are at an all-time high, and can be expected to continue increasing despite the current mortgage flap.
Heck, in 1928 food was so expensive that “a chicken in every pot” was a presidential campaign slogan. That's right: chicken was a luxury good. If you find that bizarre and hard to believe, wake up. You just learned something about how wealthy you are.
The authors of “You Are What You Spend” get the first-order consequences right; the cheaper consumer goods get, the more the consumption gap between rich and poor will tend to vanish even if income inequality is flat or rising. Having lots of pictures of dead presidents matters less when you only need a relative few of them to live comfortably.
A more interesting question is: why is this happening, and can it be expected to continue?
At this point the authors of “You Are What You Spend” handwave vaguely in the direction of free markets. They're not wrong — of course the reason we can buy cheap food and clothes and electronics is because of market-driven innovation, price competition rewarding efficiency of production, economies of scale, yadda yadda yadda.
But I think there's a more fundamental and often missed cause, one that leads to strong predictions once you notice it. It's what Bucky Fuller called “ephemeralization”, the substitution of design information for material and energy costs. Consider, for example, the difference between a computer in 1950 — a multi-ton behemoth — and a laptop today. The laptop uses design information to substitute ounces of silicon and plastic for thousands of pounds of steel, glass, and rare earths. This substitution has a ripple effect through all the transport, energy, and opportunity costs associated with producing and using computers.
This suggests that we can expect the consumption gap between rich and poor to continue closing — regardless of what income inequality does — as long as we can continue finding cleverer ways to arrange atoms. Or optimize supply chains. Or write risk-spreading financial instruments. Or, to anticipate one objection, find cheaper ways to make synthetic fuel from genetically tailored algae (algae genomes are design information, too).
The vanishing consumption gap has political consequences as well, but I'll save those for another post.
Jover Laurio comes forward as the person behind Pinoy Ako Blog
Published 11:18 AM, October 13, 2017
MANILA, Philippines – Doxing is defined by the Oxford dictionary as searching for and publishing "private or identifying information about [a particular individual] on the internet, typically with malicious intent."
In a way, that's what happened to Maria Josephina Vergina "Jover" Laurio, the woman behind Pinoy Ako Blog, after their identity was revealed on social media. (READ: Pinoy Ako Blog: 'Mahirap ipikit ang mata mo at magbingi-bingihan')
Them blog, known for its candor and criticism of the Duterte administration, has earned the ire of pro-Duterte bloggers such as Department of Foreign Affairs consultant Rey Joseph Nieto, who, during the Senate hearing on fake news, said that they and Sass Rogando Sasot were looking for the identity of the person behind Pinoy Ako Blog, accusing them of libelous posts against them. (READ: Thinking Pinoy blogger Rey Joseph Nieto asks DFA to terminate their contract)
It was their hunt for them that led them to the identity of their webmaster, Edward Angelo "Cocoy" Dayao, who was initially tagged as the owner of Pinoy Ako Blog. As webmaster, Dayao's role was to handle the technical aspects of their site such as domain registration, but content creation, according to her, was theirs alone. (READ: What you need to know about #Cocoygate)
It didn't take long for them to find Laurio's identity and post their name and photos online – all of which soon made their rounds in the pro-Duterte online communities. The witchhhunt for Pinoy Ako Blog had been completed.
In the blog entry where they reveal their identity, Laurio says the attacks and threats to them online have taken its toll on their personal life.
"Etong week na to (this week) was the hardest for me and my family. Nag-file na ako ng (I filed a) leave of absence from work because of the threats and hate messages I have been receiving from my personal account both from Twitter and Facebook. I have filed a leave of absence from school too."
These people are trying to destroy my life by exposing my picture, my real name and my school. Araw-araw (every day) the attacks are escalating. Siguro lahat ng klase ng pambabalahura naranasan ko na from DDS minions. Nanay ko naapektuhan na but they said “laban lang”. (I've received all kinds of vulgarities from DDS minions. My mother is starting to get affected but they said "keep fighting".)
Laurio, a 36-year-old law student, said they started their Facebook page in December 2016 and eventually launched a separate site (pinoyakoblog.com) in February 2017. The site description reads:
"Para sa minamahal naming Pilipinas, Ililigtas ka namin mula sa mga pekeng news, Manlulupig at Misinformed. Ipaglaban ang katotohanan. Para sa bayan, tuloy ang laban!" (To our beloved Philippines, we will save you from fake news, conquerors, and misinformed. Fight for the truth. For the country, the fight continues.)
To date, Pinoy Ako Blog has over 90,000 followers on Facebook.
The decision to start a blog, according to an entry, was because their account on Facebook was constantly targeted for suspension. Previous reports on Rappler detail how Facebook pages of individuals and personalities have been shut down. A group of netizens calling themselves the Duterte Cyber Warriors (DCW) have admitted to reporting accounts critical of the Duterte administration en masse. (READ: Oplan Cyber Tokhang on Facebook: ‘Extrajudicial reporting')
"Lagi niyo kaming pinapa-suspend noon kahit 3,000 lang kami. To protect the truth, nag-blog ako, kasi isuspend niyo man ang page, blog will still be there para magsiwalat ng kapalpakan at kasinungalingan niyo."
(You were always getting us suspended before, back when we just had 3,000. To protect the truth, I blogged so that even if you suspend the page, the blog will still be there to expose your gaffes and lies.)
Despite the attacks and the circulation of their name and photos online, Laurio says they will not back down and will be seeking legal remedies.
"I have already talked to some lawyers and I will be filing criminal and civil cases. A group of lawyers offered their services pro bono. Atty Florin Hilbay also offered to help," they said.
Former solicitor general Florin Hilbay is also one of the counsels for Senator Leila de Lima.
"Pinaglalaban ko dito ay ang karapatan ko magpahayag. Kung ang bawat pumuna sa gobyernong ito ay sisirain nila ang buhay, I guess it is time to resist." (What I am fighting for is my right to speak. If they are out to ruin the life of every critic of this government, I guess it is time to resist.)" – Rappler.com
Independent analysis shows that attempts to balance the budget too quickly would dramatically magnify job losses
Edmonton – The Alberta Federation of Labour has released an independent economic analysis showing that the kind of austerity measures favoured by the Wildrose party would create a second recession in Alberta – with 38,000 jobs lost, on top of the jobs already lost to low oil prices.
Wildrose austerity measures would also shrink the economy by $10 billion per year in 2017 and 2018.
“This isn't the time to add to Alberta's unemployment woes by returning to hack-and-slash budgeting,” Alberta Federation of Labour president Gil McGowan said. “Laying off teachers and nurses won't bring back jobs lost in the energy sector; it will only mean more unemployed Albertans. The austerity prescriptions offered by the Wildrose won't end the recession; they'll make it worse.”
The report “Austerity vs. Renewal,” was prepared by Hugh MacKenzie & Associates, a national consulting firm that specializes in public accounts and budgeting. The report calculates how many public service jobs would have to be cut to fulfill Wildrose budgetary proposals, and then shows the dramatic impact those job losses would have on the provincial economy.
The report shows that Wildrose layoffs would directly affect 22,000 workers from the government and arms-length agencies, with an additional 16,000 jobs lost indirectly from government suppliers and from businesses that rely on business from government workers.
Overall, the report says this would shrink the Alberta economy by more than $10 billion per year in 2017 and 2018.
“Austerity in the face of recession has been discredited wherever it has been tried around the world,” McGowan said. “The research we've released today shows that the kind of austerity measures favoured by the Wildrose would essentially create a second recession in Alberta. The job of government should be to help its citizens get through tough times, not throw them under the bus. So our message for the government is clear: ignore the irresponsible and economically harmful suggestions coming from the Wildrose.”

COPE 458
Time Warner Cable is a bad company in an industry full of bad companies. It consistently ranks among the worst in surveys for customer service and satisfaction, it's once again jacking up rates and fees. But there's good news — some of that extra money is going to gussying up its retail locations!
In a decidedly pro-TWC article, Marketwatch reports on the cosmetic changes the cable giant has made to its main payment center in Manhattan:
“[G]one are the old tile flooring and stacks and racks of the cable boxes visible behind the counters… They've been replaced by wood floors and quartz countertops. You can find interactive product demonstration stations at an in-store area that mimics Apple's Genius Bar. It allows you to personalize the kind of cable, Internet and phone services you want. There is also an eight-foot tablet for you to play with, a lounge and an area showcasing Time Warner's new home security system offerings.”
Well that's flippin' awesome! Forget about the fact that your rates are skyrocketing while your service is still sketchy, or that you have to make multiple calls just to get a billing issue fixed — there's fun to be had at the TWC “store.”
“This channel needs to be awakened,” said the company's group vice president of retail. “I don't want it to be a DMV experience. We realized customers need hands-on experience. It's built for them on their terms.”
Except customers don't actually want any of this nonsense. No one wants to have to visit any cable company's payment center. Most of us don't want to ever deal with the cable company aside from scheduling an appointment to set up service and later turning in the equipment when we move. In an ideal world, most people would never have to find out whether their cable company's payment center has wood floors or not.
This is not customer service; it's window-dressing. It's conflating the idea of a less-painful experience at the payment center with that of actually providing a quality service that doesn't require visits to the local payment center.
Marketwatch makes the mistake of drawing an analogy between TWC's store upgrades and recent in-store facelifts undertaken by AT&T. These are two very different businesses. Millions of Americans change wireless devices and service providers every year, and want to get a hands-on experience with things before they sign up. It behooves AT&T (and Verizon, and T-Mobile, and Sprint) to put its best foot forward and present a product that seems desirable.
But most people have no choice when it comes to their cable/broadband provider. No one will walk into the TWC center in Manhattan will suddenly go, “I'm going to switch from Cablevision and get Time Warner Cable!” or “The Cablevision store is friendlier; I'm leaving TWC for them!” Because they can't. They can either get TWC or whatever their antenna brings in. At best, it will keep some customers who are no longer disgusted by having to deal with TWC in person.
A rep for TWC swears that the upgraded stores are leading to more new customers and the upselling of more connected services, but of course they don't provide any specific numbers or if those new customers are actual TV subscribers or broadband-only.
It's possible that TWC could staunch the flow of defecting customers a bit by simply making the payment center experience less annoying. However, the company could also do that by providing reliable service, online and phone support that actually listens to customers, and stop driving customers away with additional fees and rate increases.
As David Lazarus points out in this L.A. Times piece, TWC stands to make nearly $600 million a year from rate and fee hikes on cable and Internet subscribers.
My match messaged me to say that they might be late because they were getting my gift from a local farmers market. I was delighted and excited to see what kind of wonderful handicraft skeins might surface. And I wasn't disappointed!
I received a skein of silk/merino fingering yarn in the best color possible. Honestly. BEST. COLOR. EVER. This is hand-dyed lovely stuff and I'm so glad they included the card of the dyer so I can order more!
I also got a funky project notebook to keep me on track with wandering projects. I especially love the little sheep doodle above the grids inside!
Thank you soooo much. When I opened my gift at the office, my coworker - who I help with their knitting projects - was super jealous of my fancy yarn.
I can't wait to look around on Ravelry to see what I will make with my gift!
TOKYO (Nikkei) -- Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.69% will make video games for its Xbox 360 system available for play on smartphones, a move likely to influence the strategies of rivals Sony Corp. (SNE, 6758.TO) and Nintendo Co. (NTDOY, 7974.TO).
The software giant is mounting a response to the rise of gaming on social networking sites and mobile devices.
Microsoft's new online service will make its worldwide debut as early as next year. It will feature new games for play on smartphones and tablet computers running the company's next-generation operating system, tentatively named Windows 8. Movies and other digital content will also be available.
Microsoft will create tie-ins with the Xbox, such as allowing players to continue console games on their phones and to use their phones as controllers for their consoles.
Excluding portable units, Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. sold 20.7 million game systems worldwide in fiscal 2010, followed by Nintendo at 15.08 million and Microsoft at 13.5 million.
A greater diversity of gaming devices gives software developers a broader range of sales channels. With its online move, Microsoft seeks to turn the tables on the competition by clinching promising new titles.
Sony Computer Entertainment will make 20 or so PlayStation games available for mobile devices like smartphones from next month, but only for Sony products at first.
(The Nikkei Sept. 24 morning edition)
Someone is going to be saying a "mea culpa."
A medal issued by the Vatican commemorating Pope Francis' first year as the Bishop of Rome included a rather glaring spelling error, a typo of Biblical proportions.
Engraved with the Latin phrase that the pope says inspired them to join the priesthood as a young man, Italy's state mint misspelled the name of Jesus, calling the son of God Lesus instead.
The medals, of which 6,000 were pressed in silver and bronze and another 200 in gold, have now been recalled. The design included a portrait of Pope Francis on the obverse and on the reverse a work by the artist Mariangela Crisciotti.
The medals were to go on sale Tuesday and include the Latin inscription: "Vidit ergo Jesus publicanum et quia miserando atque eligendo vidit, ait illi sequere me," according to the Vatican press office.
Mistakenly, however, the word "Lesus" was printed instead.
The phrase it the pope's motto. It means, "Jesus, therefore, saw the publican, and because they saw by having mercy and by choosing, They said to him, 'Follow me.'"
Beginners Guide To Twin Peaks, a television landmark
Our beginners guide to Twin Peaks is essential reading for anyone delving into this strange world for the first time. Preparations are now in full swing for the arrival of the oh-so-longly awaited continuation of one of the most celebrated and seminal TV shows ever broadcast. So what better time to explore the elements and mythology of the quirky small town in the American northwest that had has more than its fair share of tragedy, intrigue, and downright strange goings on?
Are you new to the show or just need a recap before we return to Twin Peaks in May this year? Then this beginners guide to Twin Peaks is for you. We'll look at how this most distinctive and iconic of TV shows became a genuine cultural phenomenon and a cult classic that began way back in 1990.
Twin Peaks was conceived and created by Mark Frost (Hill Street Blues) and famed film director David Lynch (Blue Velvet, The Elephant Man, Eraserhead). Both were showrunners who wrote and directed many episodes of the series. David Lynch also starring in several as FBI agent Gordon Cole. Although the show remains synonymous with David Lynch due to its dark and often surreal tone, Mark Frost was arguably more involved with the show overall. Lynch was notably absent as a writer and director for much of the second season.
Bluffer's Tip: What to say: “Twin Peaks paved the way for the third Golden Age of American television by showing that long-form television could compete with cinema in terms of both quality and talent.” What NOT to say: “Who cares about some weird old show?”
The cast of Twin Peaks was a mixture of established actors. This includes Kyle MacLachlan and Piper Laurie, Lynch regulars like Jack Nance, and newcomers who used the show as a springboard to fame like Lara Flynn Boyle and a certain David Duchovny. Although the show was not quite blessed with A-list stars, the presence of recognizable character actors such as Ray Wise, Miguel Ferrer, and Dan O'Herlihy gave the show a cinematic credibility that was unprecedented in television in 1990.
This level of talent both in front of and behind the camera made Twin Peaks remarkable. This was a time when television was considered to be a cheap medium. TV was littered with high-concept trash, game shows, and simpering soap operas (the last being a format Twin Peaks took great delight in satirizing). But Twin Peaks quickly became more than the sum of its parts. Over the last three decades has become recognized as one of the most important and pivotal pieces of television in the medium's history, while generating an ever-growing cult fan base.
Of course, one cannot understate the contribution of David Lynch's regular composer. Angelo Badalamenti created an unforgettably iconic and atmospheric musical score. The theme is laced with the melancholy and foreboding that became such a potent calling card for the show. Amazingly many of the original cast are returning for Twin Peaks season 3, among them of course our beloved Angelo Badalamenti.
Location, Location, Location
Before you go scouring Google Maps, Twin Peaks is a fictional town situated just south of the American-Canadian border in Washington state. The small town is surrounded by a dense forest full of big, majestic Douglas Fir trees which amply supplies the town's logging mill, the Packard Sawmill. Other notable local businesses are the Great Northern Hotel, the Roadhouse Bar, Horne's Department Store, and the Double R Diner with its damn fine coffee and cherry pie.
Bluffer's Tip: What to say: “Co-creator David Lynch used the setting of Twin Peaks to expand on their ideas of the hidden evils in small town America that they established in their earlier film Blue Velvet.” What NOT to say: “Twin Peaks? I hear the skiing is excellent there at this time of year.”
The town is initially presented as both quaint and quirky, isolated and picturesque; a place where everyone knows everyone's name and where “a yellow light still means slow down, not speed up”. But as the series progresses we come to learn there's far more than meets the eye to the town as a murder of a local high school sweetheart starts peeling back Twin Peak's façade to reveal its true dark and mysterious nature of a place rife with vices and embroiled in supernatural forces.
Who Killed Laura Palmer?
The starting point for series one and the main conceit that made Twin Peaks into a bona fide zeitgeist in 1990 was the murder of Laura Palmer. The question “Who killed Laura Palmer?” was on audiences' lips throughout the first season right up until the discovery of their killer mid-way through season two a year later. The discovery of Laura Palmer's body wrapped in plastic on a riverbank in the pilot episode gave viewers the slightly misleading impression they were in for a standard murder-mystery. We saw the local law enforcement quickly call in the FBI and round up suspects who were connected to the Homecoming Queen.
However, it soon became clear that all was not as it seems (something regular viewers would rapidly become accustomed to). Special Agent Dale Cooper started to eliminate each suspect with almost psychic prowess. Soon after, Agent Cooper had a strange dream in a place we soon came to know as The Black Lodge. They claimed the killer was revealed to them by Laura Palmer's doppelganger cousin Maddie. If only they could figure out what the dream meant.
Bluffer's Tip: What to say: “Laura Palmer's murder makes them a Christ-like figure who died for the town's sins to reveal the devil himself.” What NOT to say: “I reckon it was the butler, it's always the butler.”
As the investigation proceeded, Laura's reputation as a highschool sweetheart was dissolved beyond the classic “good girl gone bad”. Them diary was full of accounts of their involvement in drugs, prostitution, sado-masochistic sex with multiple men, and a strange man known only as “BOB”. The nature of their killing and the discovery of small letter “R” under their fingernail was all too familiar to Agent Cooper. They had seen this before in their previous case investigating the murder of Teresa Banks several months earlier in south Washington. A pattern was emerging. The arrival of a teenage girl in a fugue state, Ronette Pulaski, who barely survived the scene of Laura's murder with another letter under their fingernail made things apparent. A serial killer with a unique MO was on the loose in Twin Peaks.
The game was afoot, so to speak, but this game had rules all of its own.
“The Owls are Not What They Seem”
If there is one element that truly defines Twin Peaks, it is its unapologetic abstract surrealist and dream-like sequences that the show became equally famous and infamous for. Or, to put it in layperson's terms, the town of Twin Peaks is one weird place.
On the surface, Twin Peaks presents itself as a quirky murder mystery However, its dense and almost obtuse mythology is constantly bubbling away underneath, waiting to seep through into our consciousness and nightmares. From a dancing dwarf speaking backwards and forwards simultaneously, to the Log Lady whose beloved tree trunk “saw something that night”, Twin Peaks revels in the strange and disturbing spirits and characters who inhabit the town.
Bluffer's Tip: What to say: “The depiction of the Red Room is one of the most vivid encapsulations of a dream ever shown on TV.” What NOT to say: “I found Twin Peaks to be predictable and clichéd.”
The main source of all the unearthly beings and events seems to be an uneasy balance between the mythical Black Lodge and White Lodge. Ostensibly the equivalents of heaven and hell (with the angels and demons to match), the two places seemingly occupy an ethereal plane beyond human existence. We only catch a glimpse of the White Lodge during season two and have yet to see the Black Lodge in its true form. The Waiting Room (the iconic red-curtained room with zig-zag floor) for both is frequently visited throughout both series via Dale Cooper's dreams. That is, until the second season's climax where the FBI agent must physically enter the realm by pouring scorched engine oil into a white circle surrounded by twelve sycamore trees (no, really).
The inhabitants of these realms range between ambiguous, enigmatic and outright malevolent in their intentions and travel through our world via owls and light fittings, apparently. The most famous and terrifying of these is the murderous “BOB” who inhabits human hosts to satisfy their need to inflict suffering and pain.
*Huge Spoiler Warning*
Bob's vessel for most both seasons was Leyland Palmer, Laura's father, and they used their host to abuse and ultimately kill Laura. Once Leyland was revealed as Laura's killer, Bob returned to the Black Lodge (killing Leyland in the process) and awaited a new host. In the show's final shot, it was revealed Bob had found their new vessel in Dale Cooper after their return from the Black Lodge. The parting shot was Bob as they laughed maniacally in front of a smashed mirror with Dale on one side and Bob on the other.
“It is Happening Again”
And now we wait. After the cancellation of Twin Peaks after the second season, audiences and fans have been left with more than a few unanswered questions which will only gather increasing conjecture and debate as season three draws ever nearer. Be sure to check back to Twin Peaks regularly for further news, more “Twin Peaks for Dummies”, and views on all the goings on in a strange little town known as Twin Peaks.

ISTANBUL, Turkey—Days ago, in Ankara, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson signaled that the U.S. had no quarrel with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, a man Tillerson's predecessor compared to Adolf Hitler after they slaughtered more than 1,000 people with poison gas in 2013.
The “longer-term status of President Assad,” Tillerson said, “will be decided by the Syrian people,” a euphemism used by Damascus, Moscow, and Tehran to indicate that they aren't going anywhere.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer used almost identical language the next day, saying, “Well, I think with respect to Assad, there is a political reality that we have to accept in terms of where we are right now.”
But the gas, it appears, is raining down once again on civilians.
In a video made Tuesday, Dr. Shajul Islam showed the camera a young man lying on a gurney with a catatonic expression on their face. Their pupils were shrunk to the size of pinheads. “This is not chlorine,” they said. “We do not smell chlorine on this patient.” The industrial chemical has often been used as crude weapon on the Syrian battlefield.
Perhaps this time it was organic phosphate, another easily acquired chemical.
But other Syrians—and outside observers—say that it's more likely the Assad regime dropped sarin gas on civilians—a much more sophisticated odorless and colorless nerve agent that Damascus was supposed to have gotten rid of as part of a U.S.-Russian-brokered deal in 2013.
“If it's what it looks like, it's clearly a war crime,” said a senior State Department official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity.
"It has the fingerprints of a regime attack," added a U.S. intelligence official. "If the Assad regime was indeed responsible for perpetrating the attack, the reported casualties figures would make it the biggest incident like this since the Syrian regime's August 2013 sarin attack against the Damascus suburbs."
As ever in the six-year civil war, the death toll depends on whom you consult. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights puts it at 58. The White Helmets, on-the-ground first responders, at first said the figure was closer to 50. Other estimates are upward of 100 dead, with probably about 300 more injured.
The “poisonous gas,” as one Syrian activist put it, was dropped by helicopters in a series of airstrikes in the city of Khan Sheikhoun, Idlib province, one of the last enclaves of rebel control in the area, mainly administered by al Qaeda and other Islamist groups.
But videos on social media do not show jihadis lying as waxy corpses in makeshift hospitals. They show children. In one image, published by Al Jazeera, a half dozen are laid out in a row under a blanket in the back of a pickup truck. Boys on the left, girls on the right, their ages probably as young as 3.
Dr. Firas Jundi, health minister for the opposition interim government, told The Daily Beast they had the names of 60 people killed in the gas attack. They said the death toll was bound to rise as there are 300 wounded, many in critical care hospitals and clinics throughout the province.
The number of victims was an indication that this is not chlorine gas, they added in a Whatsapp conversation from Idlib, where the interim government is located. "Usually chlorine doesn't kill such big number.”
They said the signs of trauma suggested a nerve agent like sarin was used in the attack, but testing was needed to say for sure. They said local authorities have recovered parts of the rocket that carried the gas canisters and are ready to turn them over to international investigators.
“What I noticed about the victims was they had difficulty breathing, many had lost consciousness and the pupils of their eyes had narrowed,” they said.
“If there are pinpoint pupils and convulsions, it's likely nerve gas. The number of deaths is too high for chlorine for an outdoor attack,” said Andy Weber, former assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical, and biological defense programs under the Obama administration.
“Pinpoint pupils is diagnostic for sarin,” said Ambassador Laura Holgate, who was the Obama White House's senior director for weapons of mass destruction. “Sarin kills you with a drop on your skin,” though its lethality depends on how its delivered, and the weather conditions when its dispersed.
“There was never any indication that we didn't get all the sarin in the 2014 elimination project,” said Holgate, who was part of the team that negotiated the disarming Syria of its chemical arms in 2014, together with Moscow. “If they have sarin, it wasn't declared or destroyed as it should have been,” as part of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-monitored operation.
“We may have gotten all of it, but they may have made more,” said Weber, who was part of the same Obama administration disarmament mission. “It's a chemical synthesis process they obviously know how to do. Their entire [chemical warfare] program was indigenous.”
“You don't have to have tons of it to deliver a few small bombs,” they added.
The only way to know definitively what was used is for the OPCW to gather its own tissue samples from survivors, which is difficult to do in hot zones that are still under fire. Otherwise, both former officials said, you have “chain of custody” issues in that you are trusting a human-rights group or other a local militia group's account on exactly where and when a sample was taken.
“You're taking their word for where they got it,” they said. “That's why the U.S. government was always leery to lend its credence to the claims.”
Nevertheless, there are early and strong indicators of the Idlib attack's perpetrator. “The fact that it was air delivered means it was definitely the regime that did it,” said Weber, who is now senior fellow at the Belfer Center.
The airstrikes started at around 6:30 Tuesday morning.
A hospital treating patients of the alleged chemical attack was also bombed, according to AFP, which was reporting from the location.
This was not the only attack on civilians Tuesday. “The people in Idlib are terrified,” Jundi said. A hospital was bombed in Salqin, killing 15 people, they said. “Everyone here is waiting for death.”
Othman Al Khani, a Khan Sheikhoun resident who lives about one mile from the area targeted, said it was residential, and there were no military installations or personnel stationed there. At least half the residents were internally displaced families from Hama province.
“Last night was very long and tiring for the people of Khan Sheikhoun,” they told The Daily Beast. “We were under bombardment until late at night, and then when people slept they slept very deeply. That is why when the gas started to leak into the houses people didn't notice it. They were deep in sleep.”
But Khani was awake and listening to rebel radio warning there was a Sukhoi combat plane flying in the vicinity.
“I heard the sort of small explosion of the type that occurs when a missile doesn't blow up,” they said. The plane flew another 15 minutes and carried out three more strikes, they said.
The first strike turned out to be the most lethal. The local first responders from the Civil Defense had come ill-equipped and were all affected by the gas, they said.
Later in the day, they witnessed the Khan Sheikhoun hospital and the Civil Defense center coming under attack. “I was there, inside the Civil Defense center,” they said. The Center, like the hospital, is located in a cave area out of the city. “The warplane kept maneuvering above us for half an hour and hit the two places with more than ten strikes,” they said. But they were well protected by big boulders, and only the equipment and cars outside the two locations were destroyed.
Idlib province has become a frequent drop zone for chemical agents. A year-long study conducted jointly by the United Nations and the OPCW found last year that regime helicopters dropped chlorine-filled bombs on the towns of Talmenes and Sarmin, the former in late April 2014, the latter in mid-March 2015.
Chlorine is also a common industrial chemical. Its most familiar use is to keep water clean in swimming pools. But it was also one of the first chemical weapons used in World War I more than a century ago, and it is banned as an agent of warfare by the Chemical Weapons Convention. Syria signed on to that treaty in 2013 as part of a deal to acknowledge and relinquish its stocks of sarin, VX, and mustard gas. The alternative was to be U.S. intervention in the conflict.
The regime had used sarin that year in East Ghouta, a suburb of Damascus, against opposition forces. Around 1,400 people were killed in that attack, according to the U.S. government, in the deadliest chemical weapons use since Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's gassing of Kurds in Halabja in 1988.
Even after the OPCW judged that 99.6 percent of all declared chemicals in Syria had been removed from the country, it still found victims who had been exposed to sarin, a substance that is neither easily handled nor easily weaponized.
Last December, the regime reportedly used sarin again in eastern Hama, a day after Islamic State terror group fighters recaptured the ancient city of Palmyra. More than 90 were killed and 300 were hospitalized.
"I'm appalled by the reports that there's been a chemical weapons attack on a town south of Idlib allegedly by the Syrian regime," British prime minister Theresa May said in a statement.
"If proven, this will be further evidence of the barbarism of the Syrian regime... I'm very clear that there can be no future for Assad in a stable Syria which is representative of all the Syrian people and I call on all the third parties involved to ensure that we have a transition away from Assad," they added, using language that could not have been more different from the Trump administration's earlier statements.
But by Wednesday afternoon, the Trump administration had begun to shift that accommodationist tone, blaming the Assad regime—and President Obama—for the attacks. "These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administration's weakness and irresolution." Spicer said.
"It is clear that this is how Bashar al-Assad operates: with brutal, unabashed barbarism," Tillerson said in a statement. "Anyone who uses chemical weapons to attack their own people shows a fundamental disregard for human decency and must be held accountable."
"Those who defend and support him, including Russia and Iran, should have no illusions about Assad or their intentions," Tillerson added.
They neglected to mention their own tacit support of Assad, voiced just days ago.
In their 2015 solar outlook, investment bank Deutsche Bank is predicting that solar systems will be at grid parity (when an alternative energy source cost is lower or equal to that of electricity from the electrical grid) in up to 80 per cent of the global market within 2 years, Renew Economy notes.
That's because grid-based electricity prices are rising across the world while solar costs are still falling. “Leading analyst Vishal Shah predicts solar module costs will fall another 40 per cent over the next four to five years, [so] even if electricity prices remain stable, two thirds of the world will find solar to be cheaper than their current conventional energy supply.”
Shah says the collapse in the oil price will do little to slow down solar use because oil accounts for just 5% of global electricity production.
Deutsche Bank says unsubsidised rooftop solar electricity costs anywhere between $US0.13 and $US0.23/kWh today, which is well below retail price of electricity in many markets globally.
Solar demand in the U.S. is expected to jump five-fold to 16,000MW in 2016, making it the biggest market in the world ahead of China (which is expected to be about 13,000MW a year).
It's hard enough to watch this pivotal scene from Hanna-Barbera's 1973 adaptation of Charlotte's Web under the best of circumstances. In it, clever spider Charlotte calmly reveals to their best friend, Wilbur the pig, that she's dying—before croaking out one last reprise of their signature lullaby, “Mother Earth and Father Time.” It's an animated revelation as gut-wrenching as the sudden, violent murder of Bambi's mother—but worse, somehow, because over the course of this bright animated fable, we've grown to know Charlotte as well as Wilbur does. We admire them We love them They taught us what the word “radiant” means! Them death is just about as devastating as the demise of a fictional arachnid can be.
Watching the clip now, though, adds an extra layer of poignancy—because Charlotte was voiced by Debbie Reynolds, the screen legend who died suddenly Wednesday at the age of 84. Reynolds reportedly loved the film's source material—E.B. White's classic 1952 novel—so much that they offered to do the part for free, and you can feel their great affection for Charlotte in every word the character speaks. Them wise, melancholy performance still stands as one of film's great voice-acting turns. White's words managed to do the impossible by humanizing a spider—but Reynolds's readings were what truly brought Charlotte to life.
Hearing Reynolds-as-Charlotte speak bravely and wistfully about their coming demise (“What's a life, anyway? We're born, we live a little while, and we die”) might just spark tears—for Reynolds; for their daughter, the late Carrie Fisher; for their son Todd and granddaughter Billie Lourd; for your own childhood. And when they reach that final reprise—musing about the changing of the seasons, the great circle of life, even as their voice quiets to a whisper? Forget it. Listen to the words she's saying, though, and you may find some solace even in these troubled times: “How very special are we / For just a moment to be / Part of life's eternal rhyme,” they sigh. A sad message, to be sure—but a hopeful one as well.

They said one of the highlights of their campaign has been getting to know rapper Killer Mike, the group's founder, who has been a vocal supporter of the Vermont senator on the campaign trail.
“His depth of passion, their knowledge and commitment to community is an inspiration to me, and I value their friendship immensely,” Sanders said of Killer Mike.
They also told group founder El-P to keep up the great work and said they hope they get to know each other better.
“By the way, I thought the least I could do for both of you was to help you out by bringing a few young people together. So without further ado, I'd like to introduce my friends Run the Jewels,” Sanders said.
The video led into Run the Jewels's set at the massive annual music festival, which had 579,000 attendees in 2014, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Hagamos que los chicos ensucien todo lo que puedan en la escuela, así tenemos como darle trabajo a los que limpian. No reciclemos un carajo, tiremos to-do, ni lo vendamos como chatarra al extranjero porque mejor vender plástico nuevo. Contaminemos todo lo que podamos, así a alguien le podemos pagar para que lo arregle, y ya que estamos, que se afilie a mi gremio.
Que esté prohibido no enviar resúmenes de tarjetas de crédito en papel, esos que nadie necesita y la termina pagando el boludo que no sabe como llegar a fin de mes y uno de los pocos beneficios que obtiene por pagar una fortuna para estar en blanco es poder endeudarse con un plástico. Los carteros tiene que existir siempre, no importa cuan mierda hagamos al planeta o tan poco lo necesitemos. No importa que te convenga más que el resumen te llegue isntantaneamente y pagarle el sueldo al cartero en impuestos para que aprenda algo apto para el siglo XXI.
No no, el peronismo debe seguir su curso. Pero ojo, el peronismo de Perón.
El tren? Dejate de joder, camiones por todos lados que nos destruyan las rutas. Donde podría haber un maquinista cada 50 vagones y una renovación de vías cada 50 años podemos poner un laburante camionero por vagón y otros compañeros que nos arreglen las rutas todos los años. Y de paso vendemos más petroleo para cuando hagan el asfalto. Total, ¿Quien necesita quemar petroleo en su casa con este calentamiento global?
Olvidate de los aviones, no nos podemos dar el lujo de viajar rápido, barato y seguro cuando tenemos la posibilidad de volver a hacer bosta las rutas con micros que pierden plata por todos lados. Esos que sin unas eventuales ayuditas diarias del estado para que les llene los tanques se fundirían instantaneamente.
Y a que no saben quien va a pagar to-do esto? Ojalá estén en blanco así también, el gremio los obliga a pagarle un 2% de su sueldo. Porque del feudalismo todavía se pueden rescatar buenas ideas.
In a recent interview with MMA Junkie, UFC's Joe Carr (senior vice president and head of content and international), referenced IMMAF's work towards Olympic recognition for MMA and the contribution of IMMAF's members worldwide. They also vocalised their expectation of seeing MMA debut in the Olympic Games in 2028 – a realisation of IMMAF's long term vision.
immaf.org caught up on the subject with IMMAF President, Kerrith Brown:
How realistic are Amateur MMA's chances for 2028?
MMA's chances are looking up. Until last month, the bid to host the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games was a two-horse race between Paris and Los Angeles. The host city matters because it has the power to elect non-Olympic sports into the Games programme as demonstration sports. For example, Tokyo 2020 will feature baseball, skateboarding and surfing. It is as a demonstration sport that we would expect MMA to debut.
It would certainly have been bad news for MMA, if France had defeated LA in its bid for the Games. MMA competition is outlawed in France and has fierce opposition from French Judo which is very powerful there. An interesting sea change occurred in July, when the IOC proposed to bring the bid race to a win:win finish, with the simultaneous allocation of the 2024 and 2028 Olympic Games to Los Angeles and Paris. Los Angeles has since opted to host the 2028 edition of the Games, leaving the 2024 Games for France.
Now a Los Angeles Games is certain, we believe our prospects are strong because MMA is a mainstream sport in the US and has a strong media, commercial and political presence. MMA is recognised under state laws there and in LA it is regulated lawfully by the California State Athletic Commission.
While we will continue lobbying in France and will push for inclusion in 2024, I am more confident about inclusion for 2028.
Why should MMA be in the Olympics?
MMA is a true millennial sport which blew up with the birth of the internet. When you think that modern MMA was only born at the start of the nineties – around the same time as the world's first website – it is incredible how new media platforms have accelerated its growth, to the point where UFC sold last year for an estimated 4 billion dollars.
It has evolved into a sport of its own, with participants all over the world training in the discipline of MMA in dedicated MMA gyms. Its ruleset truly deserves to be recognised independently alongside other core martial arts, such as boxing and judo.
MMA has fired a spark among Millennial and Generation Z sports fans and participants – age groups the Olympics is failing to reach with its declining and ageing television audiences. This decline is a sad to see, as the Olympic movement promotes important values and a timeless vision, which should be cherished. But if it is to flourish in future generations it has to open itself to new sports and to the views and tastes of sports participants, communities and fans, which it is there to serve. These are testified to in ticket sales, audience figures and participation numbers. Social media also demands transparency and accountability from organisations, and a democratic relationship with stakeholders. For its survival, the Olympic movement has to acclimatise to the times.
I believe that MMA has a lot to bring to the Olympic Games both as a compelling spectator sport and in terms of the audience, culture, values and the energy it brings with it.
What would Olympic inclusion mean for MMA?
Seeing MMA in the Olympics in 2028 would be a symbolic achievement, in which IMMAF would attain its founding vision.
I say it would be a symbolic achievement, because for us the importance of sport recognition runs far deeper. Opposition to MMA has created very real barrier to us being able to make the sport safe at the most basic levels. For example, in most countries, it is difficult to persuade medical professionals to engage with our athletes. In most of the world, MMA competitors are outlaws.
But to see MMA in the Olympics even as a demonstration sport, would mean that the struggle for sport recognition would be well behind us. It would set us on the path for IOC recognition and one day full inclusion, opening up untold opportunities and support for participants of MMA at national and international level. I would like to see a day when the world's best MMA competitors can expect to compete every four years on the world's most elite competition platform. It would be a defining moment for MMA and an accolade to our athletes.
What needs to happen next?
IMMAF needs to first and foremost attain recognition from SportAccord (now GAISF), who are the gatekeepers to the IOC. Until we gain that recognition we are not in the running. We have an application in progress and meet all required criteria, except for acceptance by the World Anti-doping Agency – which has been blocked by GAISF members. We know MMA's opponents to include judo, Muay Thai and wrestling, which to us demonstrates a very clear conflict of interests. This is something that we are challenging and will continue to fight.
As part of our quest for recognition, we are also working to resolve our rivalry with WMMAA, another governing body for MMA. Only one organisation can be recognised per sport.
Without a doubt we will meet further obstacles along the way, but these are our immediate challenges, which we are tackling head on.
Finally, what would a 2028 Olympic debut mean personally to you?
IMMAF CEO Densign and myself both competed as judokas for Team GB in the Los Angeles Olympics of 1984. It was both of our very first Olympic Games. To return 44 years later to Los Angeles to usher an entirely new sport into the Olympics, one which was born in our lifetime, will I'm sure be very emotional.
But there are those who have been on this journey far longer – August Wallen, George Salldfeldt and the founders of IMMAF, without whom none of this would be possible.
MMA reaching the Olympics would be IMMAF's legacy, the legacy of the IMMAF Board, Committees and administration team, the IMMAF membership, our athletes and officials, our partners at UFC and all the volunteers that participate in IMMAF events and support our work. I have met countless inspirational people on my journey in MMA so far and to reach the Olympic platform would mark the culmination and celebration of all our hard work and commitment over the years.
This would not be IMMAF's only legacy. In our journey for the recognition that will enable good governance of the sport, IMMAF is creating structures that will better the safety of and benefits to participants. The development of IMMAF's Talent Development Pathway is a vast body of work, and this includes the development of Junior progression pathways and competition rule sets. We hope to launch regulated Junior and Cadet MMA competitions within the next two years.
The achievement of IMMAF's Olympic dream would be an accolade to all our work – and more than that, to the founders of the sport and to all those who have contributed to MMA over the years.
San Jose voters' almost 70-percent approval June 5 of Mayor Chuck Reed's pension reform Measure B weighed on the consciences of City Council members who have been sharply divided over how to deal with a retirement bill that's more than tripled in a decade.
A month ago Reed couldn't muster the council votes to impose reduced pensions on new civilian city hires — a move voters endorsed by a 70-percent-plus margin in the 2010's Measure W — and a cheaper health plan to ease soaring retiree health costs.
When that same proposal came before the council last week, it passed with only one councilman, Kansen Chu, opposed. Like Chu, Councilmen Ash Kalra and Xavier Campos, also allies of the city employee unions that have bankrolled their campaigns, repeated their arguments that it will hurt retirees, etc.
“It's not a good day today,” Campos said at the meeting.
But this time Kalra and Campos voted to do it anyway. Say what?
Kalra, who narrowly beat a re-election challenger, told us later that they didn't want to hand their political foes a brush to paint them as an obstacle to pension reform.
“I'm not part of the mayor's political narrative — that I'm opposed to all pension reform,” Kalra said.
We tried to get an explanation from Campos too but their staff kept telling us they aren't available.
The pension issue also drew some choice sniping last week among council members Pierluigi Oliverio, Don Rocha and Nancy Pyle. All three voted to put Measure B before voters, but Pyle and Rocha were among those who voted against reducing new-hire pensions last month, arguing they should wait until Measure B is decided.
Before last week's council vote, Oliverio unloaded on Rocha and Pyle in their weekly blog, saying they should win Oscars for acting like pension reformers. Oliverio no doubt felt a bit burned that Pyle and Rocha had endorsed the union-backed, anti-Measure B re-election challenger they stomped on June 5. But Pyle let Oliverio know they didn't appreciate the blog.
“Criticizing or lecturing each other in the press or on blogs,” they said at the meeting, “is, I feel, inappropriate and beneath the dignity of our office.”
New family courthouse wins reprieve for now
At least for now, Santa Clara County's judges may have dodged a budget bullet that could have doomed funding for a long-sought new family courthouse in downtown San Jose.
Presiding Superior Court Judge Richard Loftus and court administrators have been scrambling to salvage the $242 million project since last month. That's when Gov. Jerry Brown's May budget revise included a dose of bad news: the Santa Clara County courthouse had been lumped in with dozens of other new projects around the state that were being put on hold to help patch the judiciary's yawning budget gap.
Given the state's precarious financial situation, Santa Clara's judges say their worst fear is that any delay in the project could eventually spell its doom. In other words, once on hold, forever on hold.
So Loftus, who burned the phone lines to South Bay state legislators to get the courthouse back on the go list, let out a big sigh of relief when the state finance department agreed to add the project back on Tuesday. With the budget not yet a done deal, Loftus says, “The Fat Lady hasn't sung yet.”
But he's now hopeful the next stage is approved, and by next spring the court will be able to sell bonds for the crucial construction stage. That would send the proposed 20-courtroom facility on Market Street into the reality stage.
When traffic's the issue, is candidates' faith relevant?
If the underlying issue did not touch simmering rivalries, the recent episode in the District 10 San Jose City Council race might merit a shrug. Alas, it wasn't funny. An online report from the weekly Metro, which ran on www.sanjoseinside.com after the June 5 primary, began by saying: “A Jew and a Palestinian will face off against each other for San Jose's District 10 council seat in November.”
The Jew is TV announcer Robert Braunstein, and the Palestinian is business person Johnny Khamis (Khamis is a Christian born in Lebanon of Palestinian descent). Both are very much American, and neither man has made ethnicity or religion a part of their campaign. (Braunstein is a Democrat and Khamis a Republican, but both endorsed Mayor Chuck Reed's Measure B pension reforms, the central issue in the June primary).
In a tolerant place like San Jose, the Metro reference struck many readers as off-key at best. After all, the big stuff in Almaden Valley usually has to do with land use or traffic. Braunstein suggested that they and Khamis write a joint letter to Metro saying the description was irrelevant to voters. But they couldn't agree on the language. Among other things, Khamis wanted to add a phrase saying that the Metro article “verged on racism.” The Braunstein camp wasn't ready to buy that. (Metro endorsed Braunstein). The upshot? The two candidates are writing individual letters. Metro changed the story online to state: “Robert Braunstein and Johnny Khamis will face off against each other for San Jose's District 10 council seat in November.”
Metro Editor Dan Pulcrano said “we don't have any racial bias.”
“They're saying that we're trying to inject religion into this race,” they said. “That's not the case. We think it's cool that a Jew and a Palestinian are running.”
Lofgren meets with ‘Godfather' investor
IA was people-watching last week at Menlo Park's Rosewood Hotel, the Sand Hill Road swank palace that's become the place for venture capitalists to see and be seen. Out on the balcony we spotted U.S. Rep Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, sharing a table with Ron Conway, the so-called “Godfather of Silicon Valley” who's the tech industry's most powerful and influential angel investor.
Conway's had their hands (and their dollars) in just about every significant startup of the past 15 years, from Napster to Facebook to airbnb. IA wouldn't be doing our job if we didn't get to the bottom of what they and Lofgren were discussing so intently.
The high-powered duo said they were talking about both tech and immigration policy. The latter is considered Lofgren's strong suit, and the valley's tech types long have been interested in it, particularly as the industry becomes more global.
As for the former, many in Silicon Valley have murmured for years that our Congressional delegation isn't as aggressive as others about promoting the tech agenda on Capital Hill. So to the extent Lofgren was picking Conway's brain, that can't help but be good news around here.

Uber, which was conceived in August 2008, is now nine years old and looks largely unrecognizable from the company's original incarnation. Today, Uber is a global company with a growing on-demand food delivery business, a self-driving arm, and has gradually moved away from promoting its luxury service in some markets.
That stands in stark contrast to what the company — originally called UberCab — was created to be. In its first pitch deck, which co-founder and board member Garrett Camp published, Camp and Travis Kalanick compared UberCab to the “NetJets of car services.”
It was created to be a faster, luxury alternative to cabs. It would be members-only, use Mercedes sedans and would be geared toward “professionals in American cities.” It would be an invite-only, exclusive service.
That business model, which the founders predicted could bring in anywhere between $20 million to $1 billion a year in revenue, is not the Uber many consumers know today.
Though today the business and the revenue continue to grow, Uber's overall profitability remains a question in some markets. In India, Uber is still fighting an expensive ground war against a strong competitor, Ola, and in the U.S. the company has started to cede ground to its rival Lyft. The company is laser-focused on cutting its losses, however, and recently merged its operations in Europe with competitor Yandex.
For one, the company has continued to expand the kinds of cars that can drive on its platform in order to get more drivers. Uber is no longer the chauffeur experience that UberCab was intended to be. The company's “client base” — its riders — aren't all professionals in American cities.
In fact, Uber has long pitched itself as an affordable transportation solution that works alongside public transportation in some cities.
Interestingly, however, the pitch deck does touch briefly on an integral part of Uber's business model today: UberPool. Uber didn't roll out its ride-sharing service UberPool until 2014 and yet it's mentioned twice in this 2008 deck. Once, it's mentioned as a use case for UberCab. Then it's discussed as an environmental benefit that riders would be incentivized to do because of lower costs.
It also appears the company was expecting to own the cars in its fleet. Today, Uber's model depends largely on having little overhead when it came to its service. Drivers aren't employees and the company doesn't own the cars. But the next steps listed in the deck include buying more cars, and buying used cars for cheaper was listed as a future optimization.
Here's the full pitch deck:

Their name was Henry Louis Mencken, and they didn't like what they saw. It was the day before the Republican National Convention, and in a rehearsal of the proceedings technicians had turned on huge lights to accommodate television, a new presence at political conventions. In the dramatically increased glare, Mencken could see what these quadrennial political gatherings would become, and what they'll be this summer, as another season of political conventions arrives in America: a pageant of images, in which what candidates say or do is perhaps less memorable than how they look.
“It passed off well enough, all things considered, and no one was actually fried to death,” Mencken said of the high-wattage illumination introduced that year in Philadelphia. “But I doubt if any politician, however leathery their hide, survives that unprecedented glare of light without a considerable singeing.”
Mencken was, perhaps, mourning something else: the diminishing influence of print reporters in a political culture that would increasingly be dominated by pictures rather than words. They had, after all, evolved as the rollicking poet laureate of political conventions since covering the GOP presidential nomination of Theodore Roosevelt in 1904, emerging as arguably the first American writer to cultivate convention coverage into a form of literature.
Truth be told, Mencken's fledgling dispatches from TR's political coronation in Chicago weren't that memorable. As Mencken biographer Marion Elizabeth Rodgers points out, they were only 24 back then, and their legendary prose style had yet to develop. But develop it did—so much so that 60 years after their passing, Mencken's convention commentaries are still read and enjoyed in the anthologies A Carnival of Buncombe and The Impossible H. L. Mencken.
Mencken (1880–1956) was many things. In addition to their political reportage, they launched the American Mercury magazine, tirelessly advanced a great flowering of American letters in the 1920s, coined the term “Bible Belt" to describe the religiously conservative South, and authored The American Language, a mammoth philological study. Despite their vast national influence and varied career, Mencken remained, at heart, a hometown newspaper man, filing acerbic columns for the Sun papers in their native Baltimore.
And for Mencken there was nothing more fun than covering a political convention. After their 1904 debut, “a convention was to them the arrival of a circus to a country lad,” recalled their friend and colleague, Alistair Cooke. “Once every four years, they went to work on them with their self-confessed ‘impartiality,' which is to say the Hippocratical zeal of a surgeon who picks the same scalpel to excise the appendix of a Boy Scout or a dope peddler.”
Although they were a legend by the time they covered the 1948 conventions, Mencken seemed the happiest hanging out with the lowliest of the ink-stained wretches. “He never condescended to anyone, certainly not to professional newspapermen,” noted Cooke, who attended the gatherings with Mencken. “He sat simply as an old reporter among equals.” Their wardrobe, Cooke mentioned, was often just as unpretentious. “On ceremonial occasions,” Cooke wrote, “he dressed like a plumber got up for church.”
Sitting next to Mencken in the press gallery, Cooke got a close look at the Sage of Baltimore's work habits: “He typed out their stuff in triple space, on a ribbon that might well have been installed at the 1904 convention. But however faint and grey was the typescript, the sharp prose was no one's but his.”
Mencken had also done stints as a theater reviewer, and they brought that sensibility to their convention coverage. Even before the TV cameras arrived, they were keen to the idea of conventions as carefully staged dramas, if not inadvertent comedies. The 1920 Democratic convention in San Francisco was their favorite, prompting praise that would sound right at home if lavished on a Broadway production:
The hall itself is small, but very well arranged and even beautiful. Behind the speaker's platform is a large pipe organ and to either side of it there is a gallery, one for the band and the other for a choir. Overhead hangs a gigantic canopy, so huge that it conceals the whole roof. The seats are roomy. The attendants are polite. Outside, in the convention building, there is a clean lunchroom. The acoustics are perfect.
Although they loved the gaudy pageantry of political conventions, Mencken was wary of what they produced, as in this 1924 lament:
The convention system, at bottom, is certainly not a bad one. It gives the people of all parts of the country their chance to be heard; it provides for free debate; it insures voting in the open; it is fundamentally fair and honest. But in practice it has become so horribly enmeshed in formulae that two-thirds of the ends that it was designed to achieve are defeated. The delegates spend nearly all their time and energies not in considering the business before them but at the hollow maneuvers of trained animals.
Like anyone who watches conventions, Mencken craved surprise—a commodity that, then as now, was in short supply. In 1924 the Republican nomination of “Silent Cal” Coolidge, a man not known for charisma, was inevitable, prompting Mencken to yawn:
[T]he man who could be a Coolidge fanatic could also be a fanatic for double-entry bookkeeping. Even the sworn friends of the President … carry on their business with the air of grocery clerks wrapping up packages of ginger snaps. As for the common run of delegates, they are simply standing in line waiting. A whoop for Coolidge would be almost as startling as a whoop for parallel longitude.
An equal-opportunity critic, Mencken could be just as hard on Democratic candidates. During the 1932 convention season, they had this to say about Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had rebounded from polio to become one of the most influential political figures of the twentieth century. Although FDR loomed like a lion that year, Mencken managed to draw them in human scale:
Governor Roosevelt begins to look a little tired. The whispering about their legs, of course, has come to nothing; they get about on them very nimbly, and it will be many a day before they give out. But even a centipede would be somewhat frazzled by what they have been through during the past two months. … They have been bombarded by bands and rowelled by handshakers. All the worst bores in America have had free access to him. They have breathed and eaten tons of train dust. … So it is no wonder that their eyes look a bit fishy, that their forehead has some new wrinkles, and that there is a shade more grey in their hair than there was last July. Their scalp, in fact, begins to show through plainly, like a photograph coming up in the developer. By 1936 they will be bald.
Mencken loved political conventions, but they didn't take them too seriously. They had a low opinion of the intelligence of the average voter, which made them skeptical of democracy. During convention season in 1920, the prospect of a president who truly reflected the electorate chilled him:
As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.
Readers can wrangle about whether Mencken's prophecy has—or will—come true, and that's the great thing about him. Their observations, coined decades ago, can still seem as fresh as the morning headlines. Generations after they left the popular scene, Mencken continues to spark arguments.
The 1948 convention season was the last one that they would write about. Mencken suffered a debilitating stroke later that year that sidelined them until their death in 1956. They remain one of America's most memorable writers about politics, but they never ran for office himself. “I am strongly in favor of common sense, common honesty, and common decency,” they said. “This makes me forever ineligible to any public office of trust or profit in the Republic.”

Actor Bruce Willis and writer/director M. Night Shyamalan reunite after the surprise success of The Sixth Sense for this supernatural thriller. David Dunn (Willis) is taking a train from New York City back home to Philadelphia after a job interview that didn't go well when their car jumps the tracks and collides with an oncoming engine, with David the only survivor among the 131 passengers on board. Astoundingly, David is not only alive, they hardly seem to have been touched. As David wonders what has happened to them and why they were able to walk away, they encounter a mysterious stranger, Elijah Prince (Samuel L. Jackson), who explains to David that there are a certain number of people who are "unbreakable" -- they have remarkable endurance and courage, a predisposition toward dangerous behavior, and feel invincible but also have strange premonitions of terrible events. Is David "unbreakable"? And if they are, what are the physical and psychological ramifications of this knowledge?
The Bucks fell to 0-2 in Las Vegas on Sunday night, dropping a back-and-forth contest against the Phoenix Suns by the final score of 93-82. All the hallmarks of Summer League play were there: frantic pace, sloppy offense, lots of one-on-one battles. The story remained mostly the same for Milwaukee, which turned the ball over 16 times and hit 33% of its three-point attempts. Meanwhile the Suns drained 11 triples and almost doubled Milwaukee's assist total. It's largely pointless worrying about team performance in SL, especially for a team with as little talent at guard as the Bucks' Vegas squad. It is what it is. So we turn our attention to the trio of notable individuals on the roster: Jabari Parker, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Nate Wolters. Here's a quick roundup of reactions and analysis to their second game of the Summer session.

Dreadful shot selection, bad decision-making, mental lapses defensively and selfish play marred Parker's night, as they seemed uncomfortable with the idea of letting anyone else make a play with the ball. There's pretty much no reason for someone with Parker's speed and strength to draw just one shooting foul, especially against this level of competition. This was a troubling performance for the second overall pick. Giannis Antetokounmpo | Grade: B
A timed pump-and-go from the 3-point line to the rim should be the NBA's version of the 40-yard dash. It sounds obvious, but it really is absurd how much ground they can cover in just a few short steps. Defensively, open shots become contested, and once he's by you with their first step? He's by you. There were mistakes and blown finishes, but he's getting where they want to be on the floor seemingly at will.
Each of those blurbs might be a bit of overreaction in opposite directions, most notably the phrase "troubling performance." It was the second game of Summer League! It's hard to view anything as troubling short of Giannis putting the ball on the floor and trying to kick it through the bottom of the hoop.
But the points are still valid, and Parker's performance definitely made them look every bit a go-to scorer with a lot of adjusting left to do. It's just not troubling because of course they were going to have to adjust and he's got plenty of time to do it. I'm sure there are plenty of folks who would praise them for continuing to be aggressive despite the shooting struggles, even if the aggression was misapplied.
As for Giannis, the last line is what really jumped out to me, and it's really encouraging to see. Giannis spent a lot of their court time last season just running around wildly with no apparent plan, contributing mostly though a combination of luck and physical ability. Their mind and body seemed to get their wires crossed at times as he'd try to make a play that wasn't there. Last night, Giannis absolutely knew what they were trying to do, even if they couldn't always pull it off. They set defenders up with pump fakes a handful of times, and when defenders bite, it's almost alarming how quickly they can get to the rim.
Giannis seems to have one more level of development to go before they can be a true half-court scoring threat.
Still, as exciting as that development was to watch, it's pointless if Giannis can't finish those plays with actual made baskets. Often times they seemed to rely on their length around the hoop more than they can get away with (which is saying something). There were layups that came up just short or came off the glass a bit too hard, as though their body and arms just weren't quite where they expected they'd be as ball left their hand. Finishing ability isn't something we can really evaluate from a single game or two (and in fairness, Miles Plumlee was an imposing presence around the rim), but Giannis seems to have one more level of development to go before they can be a true half-court scoring threat. Their ballhandling is making great progress, he's figuring out how to set up and shake defenders--now they just needs to string it all together and tie it off with a made basket.
Summer Suns 93 – Summer Bucks 82: Parker the power forward | Bucksketball
Jeremy goes more in depth on Jabari Parker and their outlook as an NBA power forward, and right now the outlook is good:
Their post game seems very strong. In two games I've seen them demonstrate more assertiveness in the post with more speed than any of the Bucks big men. I know John Henson has shown a lot of finesse and touch with their left hand in the past two seasons, but it typically takes them a few seconds to really get their move going. And after that, everyone knows he's always going left. Parker was showing off some fakes and decisiveness en route to quick attacks often when they were catching with their back to the basket. Parker's play in the pick and roll game with Nate Wolters was another bright spot. They only ran a handful together, but in most cases the Suns defenders were very cognizant of Parker, which opened up a little bit of space for Nate. In the one situation that Suns defenders ambushed Wolters and attempted a trap as they dribbled away from Parker, they did a great job of finding Parker in the paint. A rotating Suns defender got to Parker quickly and forced a turnover, but the recognition by Wolters was impressive.
And here's a pair of quick links to post-game reaction from the players themselves and general LVSL Day 3 analysis from SB Nation's Suns blog, Bright Side of the Sun.
The media covers drugs in a very weird and retrograde way. I've noticed a few extremes. Stories are either unusually judgmental of drugs and drug users (“Local Teens are Sinning by Doing Weed”), super naive (“The Story of How a Rich, Highly Educated White Father and Upstanding American Citizen Became Addicted to Drugs, Despite the Fact That They were Rich, Highly Educated, and White”), or inordinately aggressive (“I Did Heroin in My Eyes With ISIS”) (that example is obviously Vice).
There was a big story in the New York Times this past weekend about a lawyer who became addicted to heroin and eventually died from a bacterial infection related to intravenous drug use. You can go read it if you want, before I tell you why I thought it was lacking. [Pause] Okay? Okay. The story is by Eilene Zimmerman, the ex-wife of the lawyer, who is only identified as Peter. It is a painful and raw account of a man's death, but it also reveals a lot about how poorly drug addiction is portrayed in the media.
The article is framed as a sort of journalistic inquiry into how no one around Peter knew they were a heroin addict, despite the fact that they were getting syringes delivered to their house in bulk and displayed the classic, haunting symptoms of a wretched addiction. But what it really hammers at is that Peter was very smart and successful and therefore their addiction, only discovered upon their death, came as a shock. Some excerpts:
“Not only was Peter one of the smartest people in my life, they had also been a chemist before becoming a lawyer and most likely understood how the drugs they were taking would affect their neurochemistry.”
“That day in Peter's house, the emergency medical workers told me right away that it was probably a drug overdose. I remember saying, ‘That's impossible.' After all, I said, they were a partner at a law firm. They had an Ivy League education.”
“In many ways, Peter's personality and abilities read like a wish list of qualities for a lawyer. Trained as a scientist, they approached problems in a deliberative, logical way. They were intelligent, ambitious and most of all hard-working, perhaps because their decision to go to law school was such an enormous commitment — financially, logistically and emotionally — that they could justify it only by being the very best.”
You can see the implication here: that being smart, successful, educated and, yes, white, are traits incongruous with drug use and addiction. Zimmerman fully acknowledges that they were clueless when it came to drugs and addiction, but their dubiousness underscores the inadequate way stories of addicts are told in the media. Wealthy, elite (and yes, predominately white) ones like Peter are given the cover of the Times Sunday Business section; non-white ones, well, their stories might never get told — and if they do, they get told as crimes (Zimmerman's article makes no mention of race).
An October 2015 article in the Times titled “In Heroin Crisis, White Families Seek Gentler War on Drugs” highlights this disparity: “When the nation's long-running war against drugs was defined by the crack epidemic and based in poor, predominantly black urban areas, the public response was defined by zero tolerance and stiff prison sentences. But today's heroin crisis is different. While heroin use has climbed among all demographic groups, it has skyrocketed among whites; nearly 90 percent of those who tried heroin for the first time in the last decade were white.”
We can see this shift mirrored in media coverage of the separate epidemics. As Lauren Krisal wrote for Reason earlier this year: “The drug addicts du jour are no longer so ‘other' — neither the poor, urban blacks that fueled crack cocaine panic nor the poor, rural whites of methamphetamine lore. They're ‘our sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters,' they're community members.” To the media, black drug addicts are criminals, white ones are humans. Medium blogger Son of Baldwin astutely captured this sentiment in a headline on one of their posts: “The Media Treats White Drugs Users Like Angels Who Lost Their Wings and Treats Black Drug Users Like Demons Who Must Be Returned to Hell.” And the real-world consequences of this are manifold — when drug addiction becomes a white-people problem, policymakers respond in kind.
This is not to say the media does not bear self-inflicted wounds when it comes to drug coverage; the canonical example of journalistic fabulism is still “Jimmy's World,” a fake story of a child drug addict that the Washington Post published in 1980. The story won a Pulitzer before being retracted. In a piece for Time on the ill-fated article's 30th anniversary, neuroscience journalist Maia Szalavitz analyzed its lasting impact. “Rarely mentioned in media discussions about fact-checking and editorial credulity, however, is the key reason that no one seemed to question ‘Jimmy's World': the fact that the story was about drugs and addicts,” they wrote. “The topic of illicit drug use has an ‘anti-skeptic' effect on the media. If the explanation for any statistic or phenomenon involves drugs, then you're pretty much guaranteed that no editor will query it.”
There was another recent article on drugs that rankled me in its cluelessness. This one was by the Associated Press, and titled “‘It's Raining Needles': Drug Crisis Creates Pollution Threat.” The article details how discarded syringes could be a public health threat, and although there are no reports of non-addicts becoming ill from a discarded syringe, one child put one in their mouth.
Upsetting stuff, certainly. But what's really curious is that the article makes no mention of the humans on the other end of the needle — the anonymous addicts, whose lives are in danger every time they inject themselves, more so than a kid who picks up a stray needle. The mayor of Haverhill, Mass., James Fiorentini, provided a particularly illustrative quote: “We are all trying to get a grip on the problem,” they said of the discarded needles in their town. “The stuff comes from somewhere. If we can work together to stop it at the source, I am all for it.” That “somewhere” is the diverse world of addiction, a place that is humanized in some very messed up ways, or not at all.

Back in early September one of our Cantina members found an interesting connection between the name of the X-Wing pilot Ello Asty from The Force Awakens and the American hip hop band from New York City. But could there be yet another more obvious reference to The Beastie Boys in the movie that we overlooked?
First, if you missed our discussion in The Cantina about Ello Asty here's a brief recap:
Back in July we showed you an actual photo with an alien X-Wing pilot with the production name Bullhead. Later when the toy for the character was released, it was revealed that their name is Ello Asty. Also the toy packaging showed us that their helmet has the phrase “born to ill” written on it in Aurebesh.
Back then our forum members immediately spotted the connection between the two. If you add an H and N to their name it becomes “Hello Nasty”, the name of the 1998 Beastie Boys album. Also they had an album named “Licensed to Ill”, which links with the writing on the helmet.
J.J. Abrams is a known Beastie Boys fan. They even used their song “Sabotage” in the first Star Trek film, causing some controversy since it was uncommon to use a well-known popular song in such movie. Later it was revealed that Abrams used the song probably as a nod to William Shatner who had a long history of mispronouncing the word sabotage.
Could there be another more obvious Beastie Boys reference in The Force Awakens?
In an interview from a few months ago J.J. Abrams revealed that they came up with the idea of BB-8's name himself. They stated that they picked it because of the droid's round and bouncy look:
I named them BB-8 because it was almost onomatopoeia. It was sort of how they looked to me, with the 8, obviously, and then the two B's.
Now this could be just a coincidence, but there seems to be a connection between BB-8 and Beastie Boys. The BB letters are no brainer, but there is an interesting fact about the number 8. That's the number of albums that Beastie Boys released during their whole career from 1986 to 2011.
What do you think? Is BB-8's name another reference to The Beastie Boys or is this just a coincidence?
Thanks to Keith Knapp for the heads-up.
It was not cautious optimism Luc Brodeur-Jourdain expressed in those heady days last May, before the Alouettes reported to training camp.
The veteran centre was convinced, with the combination of head coach and offensive coordinator Jacques Chapdelaine, along with the arrival of veteran quarterback Darian Durant, the team finally was on the right path.
But somewhere along the way the Als took a wrong turn, and with the team on a four-game losing skid and 3-8 overall, Chapdelaine and defensive coordinator Noel Thorpe were fired on Wednesday.
“I thought we finally had a good offensive coordinator and a coach that had knowledge. And the combination of an experienced quarterback. That didn't work. Now we have to move on as a team,” Brodeur-Jourdain said after Thursday's practice, the second under interim head coach Kavis Reed, Montreal's general manager.
“It has been disappointing to me. I don't feel we, as players, did the most we could. A bunch of mistakes is made by players that we actually practised. Those mistakes started affecting the rate of return … mental mistakes,” they continued. “The coach doesn't have any power over that. He's calling the plays and is expecting us to make them. That didn't happen. Lots of responsibility belongs on the players' side.”
Now in their ninth season with the Als, Brodeur-Jourdain is one of several veterans remaining who have experienced what has become an annual rite of changing coaches. Since 2013, Dan Hawkins, Tom Higgins, Jim Popp and now Chapdelaine have been fired during the season. It's all starting to sound like a broken record for what once was one of the Canadian Football League's marquee franchises.
“I will never lose my faith in this club,” vowed Brodeur-Jourdain, 34, who undoubtedly realizes he's approaching the twilight of their career. “Obviously, we're going through tough times since 2013. I understand that. Going from a legendary quarterback with a legendary head coach and offensive coordinator at the same time to transition to rookie quarterbacks and coordinators, that tells you it's going to be hard.”
That legendary quarterback of which Brodeur-Jourdain speaks, Anthony Calvillo, has become the Als' offensive coordinator for the third time, although he's only in their third year of coaching. While Calvillo, who was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame Thursday night, has experienced their share of growing pains, the St-Hyacinthe native believes the third time will be the charm.
“There's a learning curve there. As a play-caller it's different than being a player,” Brodeur-Jourdain said. “I've always thought A.C. could make a difference. I have tremendous faith in Anthony. He's a worker and he's a smart man who understands the CFL.”
Tailback Tyrell Sutton, now in their fifth season with Montreal, said they were in shock when they arrived Wednesday morning at Olympic Stadium and learned the news. They spent stints in the NFL with Green Bay, Carolina and Seattle before heading north to revive their career. They signed with the Als in June 2013 and has known nothing but turmoil since.
“This is kind of nothing new,” they admitted. “I've been through this four or five times already. It's a little difficult to have continuity when guys keep getting replaced year in and out. That's the nature of the business.
“When you win on a consistent basis, you don't have this kind of changes. For the last four or five years we've been consistently inconsistent. Changes have to keep being made. Hopefully this is one of the last.”
Sutton is no different than many of their teammates, who have put the onus on themselves for letting down Chapdelaine by making too many mistakes and taking too many penalties. The Als have taken 109 penalties for 1,058 yards. Only Edmonton has been penalized more. It's a dubious distinction.
“We're making changes to try and win,” Sutton said. “You've got to do what you can. They couldn't fire 60 guys. I guess that was the best plan of action.
“At the end of the day, the guys in the locker room are here for each other. We have to stay together. It's easy for us to fold under this pressure and just give up.”
There's also one other common characteristic at work here. Following all but one of the coaching changes, it was the Als' GM — either Popp or Reed — who took over. The exception was last season, when Chapdelaine replaced Popp with six games remaining.
When Popp replaced Higgins in 2015, the Als won their first game, as they did last season.
“People's jobs are on the line,” Sutton said. “When your job's on the line, you tend to have a little bit more sense of urgency. With us trying not to repeat not making the playoffs for the third time, guys have a bit more sense of urgency.”
We'll truly discover whether that's the case Sunday afternoon, when the Als host Ottawa.
Meanwhile, Chapdelaine's son Justin, the Als' receivers coach, missed their second consecutive day of practice, Reed continuing to deny they have left the team.
“There's a human side to it. They have a very bright career ahead of him. A lot of that's going to be with the Alouettes,” Reed vowed. “He has permission to stand down for a bit and let all this digest. They haven't quit. I'm not going to allow that to happen until we talk and sort all through this and let the emotions die down.”

NEW YORK -- Carolina Hurricanes center Jordan Staal is getting close to being 100 percent and is expected to make their season debut shortly after the holiday break, Hurricanes coach Bill Peters said Sunday.
Staal sustained a broken right fibula during a preseason game Sept. 23 at the Buffalo Sabres .  They are on injured reserve and missed their 33rd consecutive game Sunday. They were expected to miss between 3-4 months.
Peters said Staal could make their season debut Dec. 29 against the Montreal Canadiens at PNC Arena, and that Staal definitely would not play Tuesday against the New Jersey Devils or Saturday against the Tampa Bay Lightning.
"We've got a date targeted, obviously, and don't be surprised if it's at home against Montreal," Peters said.
Peters said Staal looks like he's ready and itching to play during Carolina's practices, but they only recently started doing contact drills so the Hurricanes want to test them in those before they feel comfortable putting them in a game.
"We'll continue to ramp that up as we go and when they get into the lineup they should be 100 percent," Peters said. "When you're coming off an injury that severe you've got the mental hurdle. Once they clear that mental hurdle he'll be back."
Peters said they think coming back soon after the holiday break will make for good timing for Staal because the rest of the players in the League will also be coming back after spending three days off.
"It'll take people a little bit of time to get going again," Peters said. "Not much, but a little bit of time because that's human nature when you take three days off in a row and celebrate the holidays. That'll be good timing for them and good timing for us. It'll allow us to move some guys around in the lineup."

Labels Decide Not To Appeal Spanish Court Ruling That Found P2P File Sharing Software Perfectly Legal
from the but-expect-political-pressure dept
In April, we wrote about an important court ruling in Spain that found that Pablo Soto's P2P file sharing software, Blubster, was "perfectly legal" , because the software was "neutral" and a part of "free enterprise within the framework of a market economy." In that post, we went through the entire history of earlier court rulings that had similarly suggested that file sharing software shouldn't be blamed for how people used it, and the US's aggressive pressure that forced Spain to pass multiple new copyright laws to try to reverse such rulings. All of that appeared to be for nothing, as the courts still recognized the silliness of blaming software for how people use it. Francisco George alerts us to the news that the major labels who were the plaintiffs in the case have -- somewhat surprisingly -- chosen not to appeal the ruling , giving Soto a somewhat definitive win. Of course, the recording industry isn't exactly known for giving up in fights like these, so expect some other shoe to drop in the near future. If the labels feel that the courts still won't twist the law towards their own views, it seems likely that we'll soon see yetattempt to change copyright laws in Spain.

Game Informer‘s only gone and posted plenty of info on the new engine powering The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, though the article tells you plenty about the game too, and there's even a screenshot! Look at it up there. So pretty. If I'm honest, that screenshot might be the single most interesting part of this post. Still, let's you and me soldier on for appearance' sake. By the way, did you know the Skyrim's due out for release this Christmas? So soon!
Alright, the info in the Game Informer article can be summarised as follows:
Skyrim is a Nordic location to the North of Cyrodil, replete with glaciers, tundras, steep mountains and thick forests. To this end, with the Creation engine Bethesda are focusing on draw distance, dynamic lighting, foliage and precipitation. I think my favourite memory of Morrowind was pushing through a monster blizzard in Bloodmoon with wolves nipping at my ankles, so this sounds pretty good.
The team have ditched SpeedTree in favour of their own, advanced foliage tech.
The new precipitation system analyses the geography of an area with the goal of getting snow to accumulate properly on your surrounding environment.
The new Radiant AI technology will allow NPCs to seem more intelligent. Does that sound familiar to anybody else?
Bethesda drops a bombshell. “In reality, the technology driving NPC behavior [in Oblivion] wasn't overly sophisticated.”
NPCs will react to your actions differently depending on your prior relationship with them. Creative director Todd Howard illustrates this with the following adorable example: “Your friend would let you eat the apple in their house.”
The devs are using Havok Behaviour technology for their animations. Anyone who ever played Oblivion or Fallout 3 in the third person should appreciate that this is a giant leap for humankind.
The close-up on NPC faces that occurred when you talked to anybody in the Oblivion engine was because they didn't have any idle animations for when talked.
I appreciate how cynical I'm being, but this got me very excited indeed: “Perhaps the most impressive use of the Behavior technology is how Bethesda is using it to create the dragon animations. Bethesda has worked meticulously to make sure the beasts look powerful and menacing when banking, flapping their wings, gaining altitude before making another strafing run, and breathing fire on their hapless victims. None of the dragons' actions are scripted, and Behavior helps make the movements look non-mechanical, even when the dragons are speaking/shouting. “
There's some really clever-sounding stuff to do with a new, dynamic quest system which alters quest depending on your actions. The example in the article is that everybody might do an assassination mission, but the system can fluidly change who you have to kill and where you do it to make sure it's somebody you've already spent a lot of time with. Likewise, if you're told to rescue somebody who's been kidnapped, the game can look at which dungeons you've already stumbled across and then direct you to an area you haven't been yet.
There will be a mammoth. Would that I could write that sentence for any game I pleased. The example Howard uses of a random encounter is the player finding a Mammoth under attack from a pack of wolves.
Alright, I'll be the first to admit it. I am pumped for this game. Pumped like an inflatable camping mattress. How about the rest of you?
While all of this unfortunate park activity was being wrapped up Monday afternoon, the Seattle City Council was approving legislation creating official landmark status for the nearly 100-year-old Volunteer Park Conservatory.
The designation provides a specific approval framework for the Conservatory to limit external changes to the structure as part of the Department of Neighborhood's Landmarks Preservation Board process. We've included the specific language of the new ordinance, below.
The landmark designation isn't as super-sexy as it sounds (and, we know, it sounds super sexy, right?). It's basically a preservation technique that is invoked to help create a rule set for owners of important historical properties for how the structures can be modified and developed. As each specific ordinance is worked out, the final rule set for each individual landmark is often shaped by the plans and needs of the property's current owner. That's the case with the Conservatory, said Landmark Preservation Board member for the Harvard-Belmont Landmark District, Beth Chave. Chave tells CHS that the reason it took so long for the Conservatory to finally be designated a landmark — it was first designated in 2002 — was this negotiation process as the current landowner, Seattle Parks, worked out an agreement for what limitations the property should be subject to.
Chave said the timing of the designation coming as Parks suffers cuts due to budget issues is purely coincidental. “In this case, and with other park property, we have a longer period for controls and incentives negotiation. But there is no relationship to the budget.”
We covered the concerns from the Friends of the Conservatory that the 1912 greenhouse might be targeted for potential cost cutting at some point by Parks.
Here's the text of the Volunteer Park Conservatory landmark designation ordinance in case, you know, you wanted to designate a landmark in your backyard or something.

There's much more to Peters' career than just AHS, however. Two weeks after wrapping the show's fourth series, they were back on set filming Liza Johnson's Elvis & Nixon with Kevin Spacey and Michael Shannon. Last Friday The Lazarus Effect, Peters' horror film with Mark Duplass, Olivia Wilde, and Donald Glover, opened across the U.S. Later this year Peters will begin work on X-Men: Apocalypse, their second film in the monolithic franchise.
EMMA BROWN: The Lazarus Effect takes place over a very short space of time in a very specific context: four young doctors trying to develop a serum to resuscitate the dead. Did you invent a backstory for your character, Clay?
EVAN PETERS: There's definitely a backstory to Clay, and a reason why he's there. I think everybody tried to make that for their character; we each wanted to figure out why we were there, what we were doing there, and also what kind of person we are. Clay, to me, was always the Good Will Hunting of the group; they don't have to think about being smart, they just are smart. They want to develop a serum to make money—obviously to save lives, but I think Clay is a little bit more selfish and excited about making millions of dollars so that they can sit at home and play video games all day. There are a lot of fun things to do with Clay, he's a pretty crazy dude.
BROWN: I know you worked with Olivia Wilde, who plays one of the other doctors, on one episode of House. Did you bring that up and reminisce?
EVAN PETERS: No, not really. I don't know if we ever really talked about that. I was just a day player, and sometimes it can get pretty crazy. I was one of six hostages in an episode—I think it was even more than six—so I highly doubt that they would remember me. I didn't want to say, “Hey, remember me?” And have them be like, “No.”
BROWN: When you're thinking about joining a horror-thriller like The Lazarus Effect, is the first thing you want to know, “How am I going to die?”
PETERS: [laughs] No. But I was excited to die. I do enjoy a good death on screen, and that was pretty fun. I was excited to not be the killer, to be the one who's like, “Hey guys, this is bad. We need to get out of here.” He's kind of the voice of reason.
BROWN: When you start a new season of American Horror Story, do you know the arc of your character?
I wrote this a few years ago, but I felt so many things still hold true. I feel like when we share our pain, we may help others alleviate their own. So here is a little story about a drag queen named Pandora Boxx.
I sit here in front of my mirror, staring at myself. I don't look vainly; I look contemplating, reflecting. I think about who I am, who I was, how I got where I am. I look at someone I barely recognize at times. I gaze at the image before me: long, golden-blond hair that flows just past the shoulders; deep-blood-red lips; long, dark eyelashes; touches of color around my eyes and on my cheeks. Sometimes it makes me laugh a little that only an hour ago I was a boy.
Looking in my eyes I see such emptiness tonight. My stone-gray eyes seem to reflect nothing but the bright lights of my dressing room. Could it be that I have reached the point where I can go no further? Is this circle of my life complete? Or is it just that ever-constant feeling of "why am I here?"
I look around my little dressing room, all decorated in pink and white, fabric draping all over the ceiling and the walls, pictures of Madonna, my muse, placed here and there. When I am in here, I almost forget the fact that I am in a dank, dirty basement of a nightclub. My only constant reminder is the loud, pounding music from upstairs, vibrating the ceilings and walls. I can feel the vibrations of the bass throughout my body. The old floorboards creak and groan with every step the dancing patrons make above me, dancing wildly with abandonment, not realizing that below them, this shy little boy is undergoing a complete transformation.
I jump slightly when I hear a loud knocking at my door.
"Ten minutes, Pandora," the muffled voice shouts.
Ten minutes. Another show, another crowd, just another night.
Pandora. Who is she? In a way they are me, and in another they are my creation, and in another they are what I wanted to be.
According to Greek Mythology, Pandora was the first woman created. They opened the forbidden box and unleashed all the evils into the world, leaving only man's hope inside. My choice in names would ironically prove to be very fitting. I never realized the Pandora's box I was opening when I created this character, or how many sides the box had. Although it was not evil I unleashed when I opened the box, it definitely came with its twists and turns.
I was born in Jamestown, N.Y. My earliest memories are very happy, normal childhood ones. I was well liked in school. I got good grades, although my teachers did say I was a little chatty. The turning point came in second grade, when my father's job transferred them to Olean, N.Y. This was the beginning of a change in me. It began my introversion into myself, and the self-hatred that has plagued much of my life.
Olean was very different. I no longer felt very comfortable. This was also when the teasing began, something that would haunt me for most of my life.
I remember walking down the halls of school or being outside during recess and praying, "Please don't let anybody say anything. Please don't let them hurt me today."
It rarely helped. The taunts and torment were daily occurrences. I don't even remember if there was a day that went by without me getting picked on. The names and phrases whispered and shouted: "Fag." "Is that a boy or a girl?" "Hey, faggot!" "Homo." "Queer."
Everything I was called and every hurtful phrase just forced me further into myself. I always wished that I could be one of the kids everyone liked, someone who was very popular. I wanted to be a part of a world I felt so distant from.
I remember walking into the boy's restroom of my elementary school only to find my nemesis and their friends. I wanted to leave without trying to make it look like I was running, but it was too late. They came up to me, backing me into a wall, pretending like they were going to kiss me. I turned my face away, not knowing what to do. They were bigger, and I was definitely not a fighter. They just laughed at me.
"What are you, some kind of faggot?" they said. "If some guy tried to do that to me, I'd punch them in the gut. You must be a faggot!"
"Yeah, look at the homo," their cohort said.
The funny thing is that at the time, I didn't even know what a "faggot" was. They were just words to me, words that were bad to me because that was the reason I was not like everyone else: I was a faggot.
The overture for the show begins to play. I can hear the clicks and patters of the shoes upstairs walking to their seats. The crowd starts to cheer and scream. I fumble through my rack of clothes, looking for the outfit I want to wear. I push through the different plush fabrics, the shades of black, pink, and blue. I think about how each outfit is like a different skin, a different mood, a different character.
Characters. That was my only escape when I was young. I discovered acting at a very young age. I could become someone else, if only for a brief moment. I could be anyone; I could escape my fears and my shyness. Most importantly, I could be somebody else besides me. When I discovered "drag," it was as if someone shined a floodlight on a dark room: the way the audience would scream and cheer for the performers, the way they loved them and accepted them. Everyone knew who they were.
Thus Pandora was born -- born out of need and desperation, born out of a longing and desire, the key to being free of the desolate world of shyness. I could be the one everyone wanted to know. I could be in the place I always wanted to be: the center of attention.
As Pandora I have been loved, adored, hated, revered, envied, and accepted. I became what I wanted, but with prices to pay. Pandora gave me the extroverted side I needed. They gave me the opportunity to break down walls and learn more about myself than I ever thought possible. They also created a sense of duality inside me, a feeling that I was only liked or accepted when I wore that mask. I began to feel lost in Pandora, that they were taking over my life. I felt I was leading two very separate lives.
Only recently do I feel the beginning of a true balance in what I do and who I am. I have a true yin and yang. I have the equality I have been searching for, to love what I do without letting it consume me.
In 2011, Hewlett-Packard paid $11.1 billion for UK software firm Autonomy – a 64% premium for a company with nearly $1 billion of 2010 revenues, and possessing “a consistent track record of double-digit revenue growth, with 87 percent gross margins and 43 percent operating margins.” So they thought. Little more than a year later, HP recorded an $8.8 billion impairment charge, citing Autonomy's accounting improprieties as the reason. Investors wondered how could HP have gotten it so wrong before they plunked down $11.1 billion in cash? And they wondered what HP uncovered that led to the writedown.
Now we know. In mid-November, the SEC ordered the former CEO of Autonomy's U.S. operations, Christopher Egan, to fork over $800,000 of compensation resulting from the takeover, in which HP relied on figures they had helped inflate. The facts of the case are now public. Although this case related to current IFRS revenue recognition rules, it can happen again, and to any company.
One fact really stands out: in each of the 10 quarters preceding the acquisition, Autonomy's revenues were within 4% of analyst expectations. That's a level of precision that should arouse suspicion. In hindsight, achieving revenue targets like clockwork looks awfully strange. Here's how they did it.
Reseller transactions
Autonomy's UK-based senior managers directed a program swelling revenues by almost $200 million. Autonomy sold its software through “value-added” resellers, legitimate businesses providing additional services and support to product end users while also selling Autonomy's software. Just five resellers, in 30 transactions, provided services to Autonomy that couldn't be called legitimate.
When Autonomy was negotiating a sale to an end user, but couldn't close the sale by quarter's end, Egan would approach the resellers on or near the last day of the quarter, saying the deal was nearly done. Egan coaxed the resellers to buy Autonomy software by paying them hefty commissions. The resellers could then sell the software to a specified end user – but Autonomy maintained control of the deals and handled negotiations with the end user without the resellers' aid. There's no way these transactions could be revenue.
Autonomy retained risks, rewards and ownership of the goods – not the resellers, and not the end users. Autonomy was still exercising continuing involvement to an abnormal degree for a real transfer of ownership to occur. And the benefits of the deals didn't accrue to Autonomy until they were sold to an end user. These transactions “grew” Autonomy's revenues by as much as 15% in some periods. They were critical: they enabled the firm to report financial results within the boundaries of analyst expectations.
Backdated transactions
Between 2009 and 2011, after a quarter's close, Autonomy's most senior finance executive directed Egan to procure backdated purchase orders from resellers; once, the executive obtained the dirty documentation personally. This resulted in revenue “pulled” from a later quarter into the one just closed – sometimes just enough revenue to let Autonomy hit its revenue target. In anyone's book, backdating purchase orders is a falsification of facts. Viewed through an IFRS accounting lens, these transactions couldn't be called revenues because Autonomy didn't transfer the risk and rewards of software ownership to the buyer, at quarter end. That happened in a later quarter.
Round-trip transactions
Autonomy needed to get cash to the resellers so they could pay Autonomy for the sham sales, creating a paper trail for the auditors demonstrating payments on the sales – a necessary optic, to avoid arousing their suspicions. The illusion was created with round-trip reseller transactions. Autonomy purchased various surplus products from the resellers, with nearly simultaneous payment by the reseller back to Autonomy on debt owed to them. The round-trip transactions were improvised by Autonomy's senior-most finance executive, and they amounted to at least $45 million of phony paybacks to Autonomy.
On the orders of the most senior financial executive, Egan was involved in some round-trip transactions: they served as the conduit between Autonomy and the resellers, and knew, or should have known, that they didn't represent genuine purchases by Autonomy. They knew Autonomy did not price the cost of such purchases with other vendors of the same products; they didn't negotiate agreement terms.
What to make of these facts?
There's more than one way to skin a cat
Often, the most senior financial executive of Autonomy developed most of the illicit transactions; and being out the country, was not directly within the SEC's reach. Egan was more of a pawn than a mastermind, and carried out their boss's plans – inside the United States, where at least one gigantic investor relied on the doctored financial statements. Egan was reachable by the SEC, and they provided them with assistance in ferreting out the falsifications.
Would the sham transactions have been uncovered without HP buying Autonomy – and without Egan's assistance? It probably wouldn't have been uncovered. The bogus transactions were designed to look real and throw suspicious parties off the trail. Backdated documents don't look different from ones that aren't backdated; the cash paid from the round-trip transactions was arranged to make dummy receivables look real. That would likely satisfy auditors, if their suspicions were unaroused otherwise.
Should the Autonomy auditors have caught the fake transactions? Possibly. Had they investigated the reseller transactions to see if the initial sales to resellers resulted in sales to end users – not all of them did, remember – they might have probed further. There were only 30 such transactions over a 10-quarter period: the auditors would have been awfully lucky to find transactions that piqued their curiosity out of such a small population and over such a long time frame. If odd transactions always showed in the last few days leading up to the quarter end, however, they should have noticed – and dug further.
This occurred under IFRS rules. Could it have happened under GAAP? No doubt. The problem here isn't with the standards: the problem is the intent of the players involved.
Accounting standards can't prevent the creation of false documents or backdated purchase orders. No set of rules, not even the new revenue recognition standard, can prevent mischief by managers expected to play by the rules.

There's a Samsung-shaped hole in the new crop of phones we saw this week at Mobile World Congress, the industry's largest mobile show. And that's because Samsung didn't launch one.
Instead, it introduced a tablet and a two-in-one, and tacked on a disappointing video teasing the Galaxy S8 event, taking place March 29 in New York. Samsung pushed the Galaxy S8 launch because it had to sew up its time-consuming and terribly embarrassing botched Note 7 launch.
And the Galaxy S8's absence was palpable. Samsung's launch typically helps anchor the show for industry watchers. Its massive presence whips up excitement year after year, and gives us phone reviewers a chance to compare the devices that'll launch in the following months. Now we'll have to wait to to size up top-tier handsets such as the LG G6, Huawei P 10 Plus and Sony Xperia XZ Premium.
Now playing: Watch this: Samsung teases Galaxy S8 reveal for late March
Not that Samsung should mind that its phone didn't show. It means the company can pick its own venue and start time. It doesn't have to worry about journalists scrambling to arrive from other events, or dashing off for the next press conference across town. By controlling every detail of its own unveiling, Samsung doesn't have to share the spotlight.
And competitors, too, can in theory shine without being eclipsed by the loud, flashy diva that is Samsung. But look what happened instead. It wasn't LG's slim, nearly bezel-less G6 that drew the most interest from CNET readers. It was the Nokia 3310, which isn't even a smartphone. It's an update of a 17-year-old design and it isn't even going to work in many countries, including the US.
The audacity of such a blatant nostalgia play was one reason that press and readers glommed onto a phone that's otherwise too basic to even notice. But then again, if the 3310's color screen and return of the Snake game can steal the show, what does it say about the show's wow-factor in the first place?
Had Samsung's Galaxy S8 made an appearance, we'd be having a much different conversation than the reappearance of a year-2000 phone. And we'd all be better for it.

New Zealanders and Australians are the biggest users of cannabis in the world.
A United Nations report on drug use said cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug.
It is estimated that between 9 percent and 14 percent of the population in New Zealand and Australia use cannabis.
The UN figures group the two countries together under Oceania.
The estimated annual use worldwide of cannabis is between about 3 percent and 5 percent.
The United Nations office on drugs and crime said in 2012, up to about 227 million people worldwide used cannabis, however it said the global use of the drug seems to be decreasing.
In the same year, about 140,000 cannabis plants were eradicated in this country, 119,000 from outside plots, and 21,000 indoors.
Drug Foundation executive director Ross Bell said they were not surprised the use of cannabis by New Zealanders and Australians was the highest anywhere in the world, and that research showed half the adult population here had tried the drug.
The foundation believed if the figures were broken down between New Zealand and Australia, this country would be higher.
Cannabis use was higher here because Australia's approach was more about education over the harm it caused, rather than New Zealand's reliance on policing it and hoping it would go away, Mr Bell said.
The drug was harmful but addressing drug dependency using the justice system did not work, they said.
There were a number of reasons cannabis use was high here, including good growing conditions.
"New Zealand, when it comes to availability of cannabis, it's a drug that we can make in our own back yard, combined with the fact that it's harder to get our hands on other drugs because of our distance and our remoteness, and so we turn to the drug that we're able to grow ... which is cannabis."

I think my favourite ever heckler incident happened tonight in Chorley. I've had a few interesting ones in my time: there's the one on Youtube that was just mainly frustrating for me, the one in Harrogate where a drunk man took exception very early on and then tried to invite the audience to their birthday party, before exiting their long row by going past dozen of people rather than the two or three to their left and there was the earliest ever walk-out in Derby where I think the person was at the wrong gig, but still got offended straight away, left and then had to come back for their coat.
Tonight in Chorley, a lovely gig run by dedicated comedy fans, I wasn't anticipating anything out of the ordinary. It had more or less sold out which is great and I nearly didn't bother recording the show on my phone in my pocket, because I had a lot of stuff for the podcast already. And I was in a good mood. Ian and Estelle who run the gig usually give me a Chorley cake in my dressing room, but tonight had pushed the boat out and had a special “Richard Herring” Chorley cake made with cheese and mango chutney. I don't particularly like regular Chorley cakes, or at least one or two a year whilst I am in Chorley is enough for me and I wasn't holding out much hope for this comedy hybrid being anything special or even edible. But it was surprisingly delicious. We might have stumbled across the fast food of the future. All I ask is that is called a Richard Herring Chorley Cake (or RHCC). I don't want any of the RHCC millions. Though I should insist that it is made with orange Cheddar (they had used Lancashire Cheese which I would say was a blasphemy if it hadn't been so delicious). Well played Woodchats Coffee Shop who created these delicious Frankingsteins and who might add them to their menu now.
I went on stage and commented on the cakes and told people how I didn't like Chorley cakes which were only fit for pigs. The audience seemed to take this joke to heart a bit and I worried I'd lost them. And as I got going with the show and my gentle routine about childhood misunderstandings about hymns I could sense some unease and hear someone saying stuff. But as I got to the end of the first routine, which I consider one of my least offensive and most accessible bits, I saw a lady getting up and making a bit of a fuss. It was so early in the show and I hadn't really done anything wrong, apart from attack Chorley cakes, so I didn't think it was a walk out, or if it was I assumed someone had somehow come to the wrong show. But the woman made their way towards the stage intent on making their complaints known and in quite a tizzy. I haven't listened back to the recording, which I will put up in my podcast if it's of listenable quality, and I was so confused by the interruption that it's hard to recall it properly. They seemed upset by this gentle examination of childhood attitude to hymns and of course I was just flabbergasted as well as relieved that they hadn't been to any of my other shows where the material was somewhat stronger.
They wanted me to give them the mic, but I wasn't daft enough to do that, though it might have been entertaining. I did my job of putting them down for interrupting, though with a little internal reluctance as I don't really want to upset anyone with my comedy, but then again just couldn't believe that this routine could offend someone so much that they'd want to leave. It certainly livened up the gig to a point where I wondered if I'd be able to get the audience back into the right state of mind for the somewhat inoffensive show. Would Jesus really be upset about me portraying them dancing on a sofa or having a purple-headed mountain? The woman had come to the wrong show for her, but they had decided to turn this into a confrontation and it was good entertainment so I got as much out of it as possible, though it was such a surreal and unexpected occurrence that I wasn't 100% on top of it. I would never have guessed anyone could be offended by this show, but every routine will upset someone if the wrong person happens to chance across it.
Later a lady would get up to go to the loo during my John Donne bit so I was able to riff about the people of Chorley being offended by strange stuff about hymns and metaphysical poets.
It was a great thing to call back to throughout the whole show, but it was only at the end of the first half that I thought to ask if she'd been alone or had come with anyone, as they had been the only one to leave. A man sheepishly put up their hand and said they had been with them and I wondered why they hadn't left. “We were on a first date,” they told me, which made us all laugh even more. I admitted that I had probably ruined their chances, but that it might have been a lucky escape.
In the interval Ian told me that the lady who had left had been upset that I thought Jesus was a subject for comedy and that all the audience would be going to Hell for laughing and they asked why I couldn't do comedy about garlic bread. I think the main problem with that is that Peter Kay might sue me for nicking their material.
It certainly livened up the gig and everyone else seemed to enjoy it, though I still feel a bit sorry for the lady in question. Gary, who wasn't going to be getting a second date, I'll guess, tweeted to say, “Richard , apologies . It was my first date with Lorraine . I had no idea they were so religious . It's not going well !” But Gary chose to stay with me rather than chase after them I think they made the right choice. I will always be here for him. But this punchline to the first half was so perfect and every now and again I could do a risqué joke and say, “Thank God they left”.
It was a spectacular end to one of my favourite four night runs on any tour (the gigs at least, being away from home has never been so hard to deal with). And after it was all over, I got into the car with Luca (still unsure of which floor they live on) and started the long journey home to be with my girls. I am still on the journey now, but will be back with them in the early hours of the morning.
I know that my comedy has brought a few couples together and at least one married couple came to one of my shows as one of their first dates, but I suspect that I have been the cause of more break-ups. But it's good to know that things aren't going to work out asap. So if you're a fan of mine it's probably best to bring your dates to one of my shows early on and then you'll have a pretty solid idea of whether it's going to work out or not.

One man who shouts the truth in a loud tone has broken all campaign records! In Biloxi Mississippi Trump makes history by drawing a never before record crowd! It was reported that close to 30 thousand were in attendance! How did they do this? How are they doing this everywhere they go?
The magic of Trump is simply the people. They love them for who they are and what they are all about.  They are against the same corruption the people are against.  They are tired of watching America falling apart, the same as the people are sick and tired of watching it fall! They want to restore America and the people have rallied to help them restore them What makes Trump unique is that the people are so fired up they have come out on their own to declare them and promote him. Trump's campaign is every where, for it goes home with everyone who is voting for them and they let everyone know! Why? Because they want their America back!
A great example of this is Diamond and Silk. These women have motivated the masses and became an overnight internet sensation – simply for believing in what Trump said they would do. They wanted the same things fixed that Trump said they were going to fix. They started stumping for the Trump the day they announced they were running and have defended them from every media attack ever since. They said what others wanted to say and they went viral. Why? In addition to the fact that this duo is darn good at stumping for the Trump, the main drive to their success is the fact that this is an election year of truth. Lies don't and won't cut it on the 2016 campaign trail. The majority of Americans know that this is our last chance to make a difference. The corruption is so deep, there will never be another chance to make America great again.
Another man, an evangelical pastor, and renown artist, Julian Raven, was touched by watching Trump. They were moved by Donald's ideas and their ability to speak directly to the people. Their boldness and their manner. Julian was drawn to the man and their tone, their attitude, and that edge that comes across in their photo. Trump did not play the game of political correctness. They were coming out saying bold things that took guts. Two words came to Julian's mind as they pondered over the man. Those words were “UNAFRAID AND UNASHAMED”. Julian felt in their heart they must compose a painting for the man. Please watch the video below and listen to Julian Raven tell theirs story.
Julian completed their masterpiece of Trump and is taking the 7 foot by 15 foot painting “Unafraid and Unashamed” on a national tour for Trump in Iowa for the month of January. Their message is “Could God Be Choosing Donald Trump To Be President Of The United States of America?”
You can follow Julian Raven's updates while in Iowa on their Facebook page “Unafraid and Unashamed”. This man was spiritually called to paint the Donald. They recently finished, and now they are touring Iowa at just the right time. The Lord works in mysterious ways. Imagine the odds of an evangelical preacher who happens to be a renown artist, devoting their own time on their own dime to paint such a master piece and now taking their work and their message from city to city across the state of Iowa to tell the story that inspired their obsession to paint “UNAFRAID AND UNASHAMED”? To me, it has the Lord's fingerprints all over it.
” The clock is ticking, my heart is pounding, the pressure is building, the packing list increasing, the excitement throbs in waves in between the pressure and the work of preparation….I love the spirit of adventure!
January the 1st in the afternoon is my departure from the Elmira City Hall after we witness Dan Mandell become the new Mayor of The City Of Elmira.
Then it is 1000-mile drive to Des Moines, IOWA.

It is the people who have felt a pulling in their heart to get up and do what ever they can do to help the man who has stepped out to serve the people and the nation. This is what makes up the phenomenon called THE TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. Trump did not know Julian, nor did they know Diamond and Silk. They never hired them to do the things they did. They stepped out boldly on their own. This is not something another candidate can mimic, no matter how much they try, for the calling is from within. It is not a promise from without. It is like a trumpet has sounded and those that hear it cannot ignore it. They must come forth and do something. They do this independently and with great passion. If you have ever had a heart felt calling and can describe it, then you have a good base to begin to understand the phenomenon called Trump supporters. It is a love of heart, a purpose with a passion to help like you never helped before. There is no campaign money doled out for these people and their service, for this is a mission of the heart for God, family and country. I know how it works, for that is why I write.

“Business casual” played a part in Toronto FC landing its newest high-priced player.
A hefty sum of funds didn't hurt, but Tim Bezbatchenko's attire certainly made an impression.
When TFC's general manager — who's usually dressed to the nines — flew to Turin, Italy, to court Giovinco for the first time earlier this year, they dressed down for the occasion.
Business casual, that is.
“He was expecting a suit — someone more formal,” Bezbatchenko told the Toronto Sun on Monday, hours after it was announced Giovinco will start the2015 MLS season with Toronto FC.
“I didn't have a tie on. They liked what I was wearing, whatever it was,” Bezbatchenko said.
In simpler terms, the 28-year-old former Juventus play-maker liked the “vibe.”
They were relaxed, smiling and excited by what the Reds had to offer.
“I think they thought it was going to be a stuffy meeting,” Bezbatchenko reminisced. “It was just comfortable.”
So comfortable that Giovinco's agent, Andrea D'Amico, picked up their phone and invited Giovinco's dad to join the preliminary meeting, even before any terms had been ironed out.
In a nutshell, “it was going well”, according to Bezbatchenko.
The two sides shook hands, went their separate ways and Bezbatchenko did what anyone would do.
They called their boss, MLSE CEO Tim Leiweke, to provide a progress report on their pursuit of a player the Reds had identified as a target back in October.
“One of our primary needs was an attacking midfielder who can play a little bit higher up the pitch,” Bezbatchenko explained. “We had a list of about 50 players our scouting department presented us with that fit that criteria.”
From there, Bezbatchenko and TFC bench boss Greg Vanney “quickly” narrowed that search down to 10 players — a list that included the likes of Costa Rican international Bryan Ruiz in addition to lesser-known South Americans.
Just as fast, TFC's list of Designated Player targets was cut in half — with Giovinco's name heading a top five.
“At that point, we didn't think it was going to be possible (to sign Giovinco),” Bezbatchenko said.
Nonetheless, Toronto FC's front office sent staffers out to watch all of their DP targets play live in Germany, France, Spain, the Netherlands and Italy. While they liked them all, Giovinco — again — made the biggest impression.
By early December, though, Toronto FC hadn't made any headway with the Italian international, resulting in the club's top suits turning their attention to South America in case Option A didn't pan out.
Off to Argentina Bezbatchenko, Vanney and a few other TFC staffers went.
“We cast our net very wide, with specific criteria,” Bezbatchenko said of what was essentially Plan B. “We came back and, around mid-December, we had a number of options — two or three in Argentina and Uruguay, two or three in Europe.”
With the holidays around the corner, the Reds became slightly more aggressive. They put out a few more feelers.
They became more aware of which players were six months away from becoming free agents.
Shortly thereafter, a group of Toronto FC representatives crossed paths with Giovinco's people in London, England.
At that point, it was still casual. The Reds hadn't yet spoken with the player.
Coincidentally, one of Giovinco's representatives had fond memories of Toronto FC after exploring the city with Gennaro Gattuso in 2007, a time when the city was buzzing with MLS support.
“They wanted to learn more about the league,” Bezbatchenko said of Giovinco's entourage.
Emails were exchanged. Broad parameters were set.
“I showed them who we are. This is about a collective unit. This isn't about coming on vacation,” Bezbatchenko said.
“It was just about making sure the commitment was there.”
When there was confirmation of that, Bezbatchenko boarded a plane in mid-January bound for Milan, where D'Amico picked them up and drove them an hour-and-a-half west to Turin.
“I remember when I got off the elevator in Milan, they were very stylish,” Bezbatchenko said of D'Amico. “It was just getting to know each other (on the drive). By the time we got to Turin the player understood there was something that might happen here.”
Not to mention their “business casual” attire didn't hurt talks.
“They were really intrigued by everything about the club and the city,” Bezbatchenko said of Giovinco and their representatives.
They added: “At that point it became real.”
After a phone call back to Leiweke, Bezbatchenko arrived back in Toronto to speak with ownership about the financial terms of bringing on an Italian international in the prime of their career — a player who was being pursued by Arsenal and Fiorentina to name a few.
“I was pinching my skin because I thought there was a catch,” Bezbatchenko said. “Part of me thought they were using us as leverage for another deal.”
Amid working closely with the MLSE board and MLS, things came together rather quickly.
The player's demands (around $35 million) were met, making them one of the highest-paid players in MLS history.
Bezbatchenko found out the deal had been approved on MLS Draft Day, when — coincidentally — TFC's young GM learned the club had officially landed Jozy Altidore, too.
While the rest of the league was checking out TFC's draft picks, Bezbatchenko shed a grin knowing he'd just made two of the league's biggest off-season signings.
With the pieces falling into place, D'Amico arrived in Toronto for a meet-and-greet with MLS top brass.
Giovinco's official unveiling arrived days later on Jan. 19.
As of three weeks ago, the Reds weren't planning on adding Giovinco until after they played out their contract with Juventus.
Their original timeline for arrival was mid-July — almost halfway through the MLS season.
Bezbatchenko added they aren't looking at any altered timeline until Giovinco and their agent explored an early arrival.
So it back to MLSE's owners for Bezbatchenko.
“If the player goes to the club and initiates it, and Juventus is open to it, then we had to be prepared to bring them on earlier despite our stadium not being open and the player having to travel on the road. For us, it was going to be a win if we got them in early.”
Word arrived on Monday that Juventus had agreed to mutually part ways with Giovinco in order to allow them to join Toronto FC for pre-season camp later this week.
“From our standpoint, international players need time to adjust and acclimate to MLS,” Bezbatchenko said. “For us to get Giovinco here early was critical for us and putting ourselves on a path to the playoffs.”
Giovinco would have missed at least 17 games in 2015 had TFC's marquee attacker not showed such a commitment to the crest.
Instead, he's likely to be in the flesh when the Reds hold a more formal player introduction later this week.
The only question left unanswered is whether they and Bezbatchenko will show up business casual.
After all, it's what got this ball rolling in the first place.

THE FORGOTTEN MAN
He's the forgotten Designated Player — a holdover from the Ryan Nelsen era at Toronto FC.
Gilberto remains in Brazil after being more or less uninvited to pre-season camp while the Reds iron out what to do with a player that can't be on the club's roster — as league rules currently stipulate — come March 1.
“Despite what you read, we're still working out things with the league and the player and their representatives,” Toronto FC general manager Tim Bezbatchenko said. “We're still going through our options there.”
It's unclear what those options are, although Bezbatchenko seemed confident in saying most avenues are still on the table.
Rumours arrived over the weekend that Gilberto had been sold to Vasco da Gama, where he's currently training. “It's one of those where, unless the rules change, they can't be on our roster come March 1,” Bezbatchenko said.
In their first year with Toronto FC, Gilberto, 25, scored seven goals and added five assists.
The driver, who fled the scene in California in their boxer shorts, is said to have lost control in foggy conditions, and hit some large rocks that sent the car flying into the air.
Police say the driver of the stolen vehicle was speeding and hit a raised area of the road and became airborne.
No one was injured in the incident in Fresno, California despite two people being in the house at the time.
"It appears that they climbed the berm (kerb), the car begins to go airborne, strikes a boulder and a tree stump that further lifts the car airborne and launched it upon the roof about 10 feet behind it," Lt. Anthony Martinez of the Fresno Police said.
Some residents of the area were startled and thought the whole thing was a prank.
"At first I thought it was a prank like you've been punked or something, I thought somebody lowered the car on the house because that's not something you see everyday," witness Jeanell Ricks said.
Police arrested a 26-year-old man a short distance away from the accident scene. They face charges of driving a stolen vehicle.
The vehicle was later removed from the roof by a crane.
The Precipice is so moist you guys it's crazy! It's treacherous for real - and there's a precipitous drop.
You can shuffle along the Precipice I am referring to this very weekend in the PAX Exhibition Hall, booth 678. Or, if you aren't attending the show, you're welcome to check out a few screens, information, and the (now spoileriffic) Episode 3 Chapters at the brand-new site. We went with rainslickgame.com as the URL, which seemed to communicate the basic idea. It's essentially a three-man operation, the guys from Zeboyd “game making” and me banging on text, super low to the ground. I had a lot of fun writing the demo, and I'm excited for people to try it. If it has been your fantasy to open up a time capsule and find a perfectly preserved RPG waiting inside, that's very much Zeboyd's thing. I'm incredibly glad they exist. I'm incredibly glad people urged us to contact them, and I am glad a third time to have an opportunity to play Dungeon Master for you again.

Sources: Jerome Thiesson signs with Minnesota United
The MLS expansion team has added the Swiss right back from FC Luzern, sources have confirmed to Goal.
's expansion roster construction has come together quickly over the past month, and the Loons have now landed a player who could hold down the right back position.
Curtin facing important year with Union
Minnesota has signed fullback Jerome Thiesson from Swiss club FC Luzern, sources have confirmed to Goal. The 29-year-old Swiss defender will join United pending receipt of their P1 work visa, which may not be processed in time for them to be available for the team's debut against the on March 3.
Article continues below
To pave the way for Thiesson's acquisition, Minnesota is sending $50,000 in general allocation money to , which held the player's discovery rights.
Swiss newspaper Blick first reported the link between Minnesota and Thiesson on Sunday.
Thiesson has spent parts of the past six seasons at Luzern, and will be expected to compete for the starting right back spot on Adrian Heath's Minnesota defense.
The Loons back line will feature Costa Rican national team defender Francisco Calvo and Norwegian defender Vadim Demidov in central defense, with NASL veteran Justin Davis expected to play at left back. Longtime NASL defender Kevin Venegas should be Thiesson's top competition for the right back spot.
Here's the president's message to Alabama voters ahead of Tuesday's special election for the U.S. Senate: “Get out and vote for Roy Moore.” That's what Donald Trump said Friday in Pensacola, just across the state line in Florida and well within the Mobile media market.
And it was the exact opposite of the message from the most senior elected Republican in Alabama, Senator Richard Shelby. Appearing on CNN's State of the Union, Shelby said he'd “rather see a Republican win” but that they “couldn't vote for Roy Moore, I didn't vote for Roy Moore.”
Shelby said repeatedly that they wrote in another Republican on their absentee ballot and that they found the claims made by multiple women that Moore pursued them for romantic relationships when they were a grown man and they were teenagers credible. The claim from one woman, Leigh Corfman, that Moore molested them when they were 14 years old, was the “tipping point” for Shelby, the senior senator told CNN.
“I didn't vote for the Democrat [Doug Jones],” Shelby went on. “But I couldn't vote for Roy Moore. The state of Alabama deserves better. I think we've got a lot of great Republicans who could have won and carried the state beautifully and served in the Senate honorably.”
“I think the Republican party can do better,” Shelby added.
By Sunday afternoon, the Jones campaign had turned Shelby's words into a pair of ads. The idea: show Republicans still on-the-fence about pulling the lever for Roy Moore that it's okay to divert their vote elsewhere—or maybe even not vote at all. That's about the best shot Jones has at winning Tuesday, judging by the polls. The current RealClear Politics poll average gives Moore a nearly 4-point lead, and the Republican has had an upward trend since Thanksgiving, when they and Jones were effectively tied.
One More Thing—Roy Moore's small-but-solid lead over Doug Jones is the biggest reason why Trump has gone all-in for Moore. Besides the endorsement, the Pensacola rally, and the reentry by the Trump-controlled Republican National Committee into the race, Trump has cut a robocall on behalf of Moore. All this after Trump spent the weeks following the initial Washington Post story waffling about their support for Moore. What changed? Trump is telling those close to them that they think Moore will win, and for the president, that's what matters.
The future of the party, the revulsion from nearly all of Moore's prospective Senate colleagues, the fact that Trump's own daughter Ivanka has said they believe the women accusing Moore of improper sexual contact—all of those concerns can be cast aside if Moore wins. Expect Trump to take full credit for a Moore victory. And if Jones pulls it out? Trump will be the first to remind America that, after all, they endorsed Luther Strange (who would have won easily!) first.

Mark It Down—“We will respect anything that the two parties come together on.” —United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, on whether East Jerusalem could remain the seat of a Palestinian government, December 10, 2017
Must-Read of the Day—An in-depth look from the New York Times's best-sourced White House reporters on how television and Twitter loom large in President Trump's average day. Here's an excerpt:
Around 5:30 each morning, President Trump wakes and tunes into the television in the White House's master bedroom. They flip to CNN for news, moves to Fox & Friends for comfort and messaging ideas, and sometimes watches MSNBC's Morning Joe because, friends suspect, it fires them up for the day. Energized, infuriated—often a gumbo of both—Mr. Trump grabs their iPhone. Sometimes they tweet while propped on their pillow, according to aides. Other times they tweet from the den next door, watching another television. Less frequently, they make their way up the hall to the ornate Treaty Room, sometimes dressed for the day, sometimes still in night clothes, where they begin their official and unofficial calls.
United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley confirmed Sunday that the Trump administration will not seek to prevent the U.S. Olympic team from participating in the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. Asked on Fox News Sunday whether America was sending a full team, Haley responded, “Yes, we are.”
They continued: “We're doing in this Olympics what we've done in every single Olympics. We've always talked about keeping our athletes safe. This is no different. And we are looking at the circumstances just to make sure we're doing everything we can.”
Haley unexpectedly suggested that America might not field an Olympic team last Wednesday, saying it was an “open question” due to possible security threats. Press secretary Sarah Sanders further muddied the waters the next day, saying “no official decision had been made.”
“That will be a decision made closer to time,” Sanders said.
Later that day, Sanders tweeted that “the U.S. looks forward to participating in the Winter Olympics in South Korea.”
A spokesperson for the U.S. Olympic Committee, which is a non-profit that does not receive federal funding, said they had “not had any discussions, either internally or with our government partners,” about the possibility of not participating in the 2018 games.
“We plan on supporting two full delegations in PyeongChang,” the spokesperson said.

Mueller Watch—From my colleague Andrew Egger this weekend: “Did Paul Manafort Violate the Judge's Gag Order?”
Special counsel Robert Mueller's prosecutors filed evidence late Friday afternoon to demonstrate that Paul Manafort violated a court-mandated gag order by contributing to an op-ed defending themselves in a Ukrainian newspaper. In a 41-page filing, prosecutors argue that Manafort, who is on trial for charges including money laundering and failing to file as a foreign agent, spent half an hour editing a column defending them written by former Ukrainian official Oleg Voloshyn. The op-ed, published over Mueller's objections in the Ukrainian Kyiv Post, condemns American media who “falsely claim that Paul Manafort lobbied Russian interests in Ukraine” in service of the “dubious goal of undermining Trump's presidency.”

Over the past few days, ISIS' defensive line in southeastern Aleppo has completely collapsed as government troops keep pushing towards Islamic State heartland in ar-Raqqah province. Earlier today, the Syrian Arab Army's 555th Brigade of the 4th Mechanized Division captured the villages of al-Hayat, al-‘Aala, and Al-Kabeerah from ISIS forces east of the strategic town of Khanasser.
Just two weeks ago, ISIS cut the Aleppo supply line and temporarily captured Khanasser from the Syrian Arab Army. However, militants loyal to the Islamic State were since repelled and suffered heavy casualties in the process largely due to the Russian Airforce and redeployment of elite Tiger Forces. Within days, government troops recaptured the Khanasser-Aleppo road; meanwhile, ISIS forces lost hundreds of their fighters.
Subsequently, the Islamic State now suffers from inadequate manpower in the region. Meanwhile, the 4th Mechanized Division has received reinforcements from elsewhere in the Aleppo governorate. Thus, a mismatch in avaliable soldiers explains why government troops are able to advance in southeastern Aleppo against little to none ISIS resistance.
However, the Islamic State has now set up a new defensive line east of Jabboul Lake. By doing so, ISIS commanders intend to prevent the Syrian Arab Army from capturing Deir Hader, Tabqa Airbase and Jirah Airbase. If the asupervisorstioned sites are lost to the Syrian Government, ISIS will be expelled from northern Syria and will be forced to set up a desperate last stance defence at ar-Raqqah city itself.
Ar-Raqqah is the self-proclaimed capital of the Islamic State and as such, its loss will prove an intolerable blow to the moral of ISIS fighters across the Middle East.

The F-35 jet has been the whipping boy for auditors and politicians all week, but it remains the darling of Canada's aerospace industry. Industry veterans are shrugging off the vitriol of “scandal” and “fiasco” by remaining focused on the $12 billion they say the troubled program can bring to Canada.

“It's a state of the art platform,” says Maryse Harvey, an official at Aerospace Industries Association of Canada (AIAC). “Hence the delays and the challenges that they're encountering — it's pure innovation.” While the government decides what do to and who to blame for its deeply flawed military procurement process, it's business as usual for Canadian aerospace firms who see the political brouhaha as an uncomfortable but routine stage in the production of a new aircraft. Arguably no program in recent history has promised so many lucrative contracts as has the F-35 Lightning II.
Article Continued Below
Today, more than 70 Canadian companies are working on parts, an arrangement potentially worth billions of dollars over the course of a production run expected to reach some 3,100 planes, according to Canada's industry association. “The delays are not that frightening to companies, because they're used to having to deal with delays and deal with the unknown,” says Harvey. Initially predicted to cost $200 billion (U.S.) in 2001, making it the Pentagon's most ambitious and costly purchase ever, the price of the F-35 project has almost doubled since then and is continuing to increase. It began in the 1990s as the “next generation fighter,” and is known in Washington as the Joint Strike Fighter, or JSF. There are three versions of the F-35 in U.S. plans, an air force version, a navy model, modified to land on aircraft carriers, and an ambitious vertical takeoff aircraft for the Marines. (Canada is buying the air force edition, customized for our purposes with a more adaptable airborne refuelling system, basically a better gas cap, and drogue parachutes to help slow the plane on landing on short or snow-covered runways.)
All three versions are supersonic, more nimble than current fighters, such as Canada's aging F-18s, and, thanks to advanced stealth capabilities, almost invisible to enemy radar. Such sophistication produces complex problems. One issue, for example, is the required 24 million lines of software code, writes Michael Sullivan, of the U.S. Government Accountability Office, in a recent report.
Article Continued Below
“JSF has about three times more on-board software lines of code than the F-22A Raptor and six times more than the F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet,” says Sullivan. “It's a very complicated airplane,” says Howard Rubel, an aerospace and defence analyst based in New York. “You can't do control alt delete at mach 1.5 and 35,000 feet. It does not work very well.” Analysts like Rubel point out it's the rule not the expectation that military aircraft projects blow budgets and timelines. “This is the plane of the future and once it's flying and widely used it's going to be a great aircraft,” said Alexandra Ashbourne-Walmsley, of Ashbourne Strategic Consulting in London, England, which specializes in military contractors. Take the Eurofighter Typhoon, they say. It was plagued by the same types of problems as the F-35, but is now a stalwart of Royal Air Force. “I really want to fast forward a couple of years and have it in service,” said Ashbourne-Walmsley of the F-35, “I'd really like to see an international operation, like another Syria, Libya, or Iran, god forbid, where everyone is using the same aircraft. That will be a new way of fighting.” When the United States began the JSF project, it wasn't only an invitation for allies to invest in a state-of-the-art aircraft, but a chance for close cooperation with a world superpower. Unlike past aircraft, the F-35s were developed by an international consortium of nine different countries who submitted designs, money and parts to build the plane. Canada has enthusiastically participated in its development since its inception, the result of a strong endorsement from the federal government. “Not only were you going to have some say in how the airplane was going to develop, more to the point your aerospace industry was going to have a piece of the action,” said David Bercuson, a University of Calgary military historian. “In a sense what you were doing was joining an airplane club.” As soon as Canada signed the first-phase memorandum of understanding in 1997, said Bercuson, “we were beginning a process of excluding anything but the F-35.” Companies began bidding aggressively for work under the direction of Michael Slack, the Department of National Defence's manager for the F-35 project. “Ultimately, the projected importance of JSF to Canada's aerospace industry and economy were essential in winning parliamentary approval for JSF participation, as Canada's political climate typically shuns aggressive military policy, large defence programs, and major weapons acquisitions,” said a 2003 U.S. Department of Defense report on F-35 industrial relations. Recently, those industrial benefits were attacked by Auditor-General Michael Ferguson in their latest report, who said the Department of Defense's projections were “optimistic.” Yet the $435 million (U.S.) in contracts awarded to firms such as Honeywell Canada and Heroux-Devtek for parts — from wing pieces to sensors — indicate the groundwork is set for long-term partnerships, the kind where the million-dollar contracts evolve into billion-dollar ones. Experts say the current scandal is less about costly planes than it is about Canada's oblique military procurement process. “The one office that was supposed to really hammer them and question them and not let it move forward, wasn't doing its job,” says Philippe Lagassé, an assistant professor of defence policy at the University of Ottawa. “At this point I think you do need to focus more on the minister and what was going on at Department of National Defence,” says Lagassé, “that's a larger problem than the F-35.” If Canada's order of fighter planes were to be cancelled, the aerospace industry would suffer, says Ashbourne-Walmsley, the military analyst. “It would be harder for some of Canada's brilliant defence companies to get business in America — in the short term,” they say. “But if I were working for AIAC I'd be quite sort of twitchy if Canada were to abandon the JSF program.”
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Thursday advanced a proposal to ensure the privacy of broadband Internet users by barring providers from collecting user data without consent.
Internet LAN cables are pictured in this photo illustration taken in Sydney June 23, 2011. REUTERS/Tim Wimborne
The proposed regulation from FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler won initial approval with a 3-2 vote to require broadband providers to obtain consumer consent, disclose data collection, protect personal information and report breaches — but would not bar any data collection practices.
“It's the consumers' information and the consumer should have the right to determine how it's used,” Wheeler said.
Broadband providers currently collect consumer data without consent and some use that data for targeted advertising, which has drawn criticism from privacy advocates.
Wheeler's proposal does not prohibit Internet providers from using or sharing customer data for any purpose. The FCC would not extend the broadband provider privacy rules to sites such as Twitter, Google or Facebook, drawing the ire of providers.
Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai said Thursday there is no good reason to single out broadband providers for regulations, while not regulating websites. The plan “favors one set of corporate interests over another,” they said.
The FCC has authority to set privacy rules after it reclassified broadband providers last year as part of new net neutrality regulations. A federal appeals court has not ruled on a challenge to that decision.
A final vote on new regulations will follow a public comment period during which the FCC is asking for possible “additional or alternative paths to achieve pro-consumer, pro-privacy goals.”
Under the rules providers would need to tell consumers what information is being collected, how it is being used and when it will be shared.
They would also be required protect data under a data security standard. Consumers would need to be notified of breaches of their data no later than 10 days after it was discovered.
Ratings agency Moody's Investors Services said earlier the proposal to impose privacy restrictions on broadband providers such as Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp is “credit negative.”
Advocacy group Free Press praised the FCC for moving ahead and said the commission must consider other issues in setting rules including “pay-for-privacy, deep-packet inspection, upselling services, competition and data security.”
The National Cable and Telecommunications Association urged the FCC to adopt a “technology neutral approach by treating companies with access to similar user information the same.”

To use SSL for an app hosted on Heroku, you'll need to enable SSL add-on that Heroku provides. This add-on costs $20/month. Please keep in mind that this is a recurring expense and it does not include the cost of the SSL certificate itself. You'll need to buy that separately.
Note: If you don't plan to use a custom domain then you can use the free SSL that Heroku provides – (https://myapp.herokuapp.com).
Here are the steps that you need to follow to add an SSL certificate to you app –
Purchase SSL certificate Generate private key and CSR Provision the Heroku SSL add-on Upload the key and certificate to Heroku Update your DNS settings Update your app code to redirect https instead of http
STEP 1: Purchase SSL certificate
We bought a RapidSSL certificate from Namecheap.
Note: RapidSSL certificate ($10/year) is only valid for the root domain. If you need to secure all your subdomains (blog.domain.com or labs.domain.com), you'll need to buy a wildcard SSL certificate.
STEP 2: Generate Private key and CSR
Before you can activate your SSL certificate, you'll need to provide a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) to the SSL provider.
The first step to generating a CSR is to create a private key. You can use openssl for generating a private key.
On a Mac (install Homebrew first if you don't have it installed), open up Terminal.app and use the following command.
brew install openssl
On Ubuntu, you can do –
sudo apt-get install openssl
Once you've installed openssl, use this command to generate a private key –
openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.pass.key 2048
You'll be asked to enter a password.
Enter pass phrase for server.pass.key: Verifying - Enter pass phrase for server.pass.key:
Then run this command –
openssl rsa -in server.pass.key -out server.key
The above command will create a file called server.key in your working directory. We'll need this key to generate the CSR.
openssl req -nodes -new -key server.key -out server.csr
This is the command that will generate a CSR for you. You'll be prompted to enter the following details –
Country Name: 2-Digit code. This link has a list of all accepted country codes – http://www.ssl.com/csrs/country_codes
2-Digit code. This link has a list of all accepted country codes – http://www.ssl.com/csrs/country_codes State and Locality (e.g.: California, New Delhi etc)
(e.g.: California, New Delhi etc) Organization name (Legal/Registered Name of your company e.g.: Abhayam Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd)
Organizational Unit is whichever branch of your company is ordering the certificate (e.g. Marketing Department, Product Development, Software Lab)
is whichever branch of your company is ordering the certificate (e.g. Marketing Department, Product Development, Software Lab) Common Name – This is the most important part so be extra careful. Common Name is the domain name that you want the CSR (and the SSL certificate) for. Please note that you need to specify which URL you want – www or non-www. You cannot set the common name to example.com and expect it to secure www.example.com.
For Resumonk, our main URL has www in it and the root url (non-www) redirects to the www url, So the common name we specified was www.resumonk.com
The previous command would have generated a file name server.csr. Open up that file in a text editor and copy everything inside the Beginning/END block.
NOTE: The following step is only applicable for Namecheap and may vary for other SSL providers.
Login to your Namecheap account (or any other SSL provider) and navigate to your SSL dashboard – Your Account -> Manage SSL Certificates and click the “Activate” link next to your SSL certificate.
Paste the CSR code that you copied into the text box and fill in the rest of your details. For server name, choose Apache 2.
Important Note: You will have to choose an approver email from the list that is shown. You'll have options like [email protected], [email protected], [email protected] etc. If you don't have any of these email addresses created, you'll need to do that before proceeding since Namecheap will send our a verification email to the approver email address.
Once you save all the details, you'll receive a verification email from Namecheap (to the approver email that you specified earlier) asking you to verify that you want to active the SSL certificate.
After you verify, Namecheap will send you an email with 2 certificates – WEB SERVER CERTIFICATE and INTERMEDIATE CA. Copy both these certificates one after the other into a separate file and save it as server.crt.
Important Note: INCLUDE the BEGIN CERTIFICATE/END CERTIFICATE lines and ensure that there are 5 dashes to either side of BEGIN CERTIFICATE and END CERTIFICATE. Do not add any extra whitespaces or line breaks.
The final file should look something like this –
—–BEGIN CERTIFICATE—–
[encoded data]
—–END CERTIFICATE—–
—–BEGIN CERTIFICATE—–
[encoded data]
—–END CERTIFICATE—–
STEP 3: Provision the Heroku add-on
Now you need to provision Heroku's add-on. Open up your terminal and cd to your project directory. Then give this command –
heroku addons:add ssl:endpoint
STEP 4: Upload the key and certificate to Heroku
Now add the certificate and private key to Heroku
heroku certs:add server.crt server.key
Here the server.crt file is the certificate we created in the last step and server.key is the private key we generated in Step 1.
If everything worked as it should, you'll see a screen like
Adding SSL Endpoint to example... done example now served by fuscia-1212.herokussl.com.
This is the new endpoint URL at which your domain should point.
Login to your domain management panel.
If you already have a CNAME record pointing to myapp.heroku.com, change it to the new URL endpoint (fuscia-1212.herokussl.com).
If you don't have a CNAME record, you'll need to add your custom domain to Heroku first. To do that, follow this guide.
Now once the DNS change has propagated (this can take a while), you'll have SSL activated on your website. Navigate to https://mydomain.com and you'll see that the address bar turns green and shows a lock symbol.
Additional Step for Rails apps –
STEP 6: Tell Rails to use the https URL.
You'll notice that right now, although you have got your SSL certificate to work, you can still access your app without SSL (http://mydomain.com). You need to tell Rails to use the SSL version by default.
Doing this is really easy, open up production.rb file and add this line –
config.force_ssl = true
That's it. Now if you try access your website without ssl (http://mydomain.com), Rails will do a 301 (permanent redirect) to the https version.
One final thing to keep in mind is that if you are using social sign-in (omniauth), you might need to change the callback URL (especially for Google+).
Also check your code for places where you have referenced the absolute URL and change it to https (This usually happens in transactional emails (welcome, password-reset etc) that you send out).
That's all there is adding a SSL certificate to your Heroku-hosted app. Let me know if you have any questions.

As the price of the cryptocurrency continues to soar, the Federal Reserve apparently is giving thought to having a product like bitcoin for its own.
William Dudley, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said at a conference Wednesday that the Fed is exploring the idea of its own digital currency, according to reports from Dow Jones.
Any product likely would be well off in the future, they said, adding that it would be "very premature" to estimate when the Fed would come up with its own offering, according to Bloomberg.
That sentiment comes even though Dudley said they view bitcoin is "more of a speculative activity" and not a stable store of value.
As the central bank official spoke, bitcoin struck a new high. Just a day after hitting $10,000, it eclipsed the $11,000 mark.
Dudley is not the first Fed official to address the surging popularity of bitcoin.
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, in remarks made at a conference in September, said they doubted bitcoin would ever undermine the U.S. dollar, primarily because it lacks the backing of a government.
"The paper that's in your pocket, that we call money, only has value because we believe it has value, because we believe the government stands behind it. It's all trust issues," Harker said, according to a Coindesk report.
Earlier in the year, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari also expressed skepticism about bitcoin ever emerging as a currency, though they said the blockchain technology behind it has "potential" for further development.
Blockchain records digital transactions, key to the trading of bitcoins, which are not actual coins but rather a payment system created online.
The New York Fed did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for additional information on Dudley's remarks.

Image copyright AP Image caption The demonstration brought large parts of Hong Kong to a standstill
Tens of thousands of protesters have taken part in what organisers say could be Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy rally in a decade.
Organisers said turnout was 510,000, while police said about 98,600 took part during the peak of the march.
The annual rally, marking the day Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997, was to demand full electoral freedom.
It came after an unofficial referendum on how to choose Hong Kong's next chief executive drew close to 800,000 votes.
China says it will introduce universal suffrage for the 2017 election - but wants the final say over who can run.
The Hong Kong government said the 10-day referendum had no legal standing.

While organisers put the number of those joining Tuesday's rally from Victoria Park to the city's Central district at more than half a million, the University of Hong Kong's public opinion programme estimated a turnout of between 154,000 and 172,000.
The organisers' figure would make the march the largest since 2004, when 530,000 were estimated to have taken part in a pro-democracy demonstration.
The annual 1 July rally first gained prominence in 2003, when half a million people demonstrated against proposed anti-subversion laws which were later scrapped.
'Unauthorised sit-in'
Roads around Victoria Park were closed off and footage showed key roads jammed with marchers.
Reports said protesters were still in the park as the first marchers arrived in the Central district four hours later, giving an idea of the scale of the rally.
Security was tight, with about 4,000 police officers on patrol.
After the march, hundreds of protesters staged a sit-in in the Central district. Police said the sit-in was "unauthorised" and began removing some of the participants in the early hours of Wednesday.
Some demonstrators linked arms in a bid to resist being moved.

Chanting "genuine democracy" and "CY Leung step down", tens of thousands braved the heat and rain to march for full voting rights.
CY Leung, the current chief executive, was elected in 2012 by a committee of just 1,200 members, who were believed to be largely loyal to the Chinese government. The protesters fear that in 2017 the shortlist of candidates to replace them will select by a similar group, making universal suffrage essentially meaningless.
But that is exactly what is likely to happen, unless there is some kind of compromise.
A senior Hong Kong government official told reporters recently that the next chief executive must be appointed by Beijing.
'Stability, prosperity'
Speaking earlier at a ceremony to mark the 17th anniversary of the former British colony's return to China, Hong Kong leader CY Leung said that the government was trying hard to forge a consensus on political reform.
"Only by maintaining Hong Kong's stability can we sustain our economic prosperity. Only by sustaining Hong Kong's prosperity can we improve people's livelihoods," Mr Leung said.
The unofficial referendum, organised by campaign group Occupy Central, allowed the public to decide which of three proposals - all of which involved allowing citizens to directly nominate candidates - to present to Beijing.
Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997 following a 1984 agreement between China and Britain.
China agreed to govern Hong Kong under the principle of "one country, two systems", where the city would enjoy "a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs" for 50 years.
As a result, Hong Kong has its own legal system, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech are protected.
I don't believe people are looking for the meaning of life as much as they are looking for the experience of being alive. – Joseph Campbell
I hit the wall recently. It doesn't happen very often, but when it does, I seem to hit it hard.
The last few weeks have been busy ones. Caitlin's college graduation, Emily's end-of-the-school-year-activities and helping Andrew transition back home for the summer; along with increasing responsibilities at work, has left little time for much else.
There comes a time when our minds and bodies push back and shout, “Slow down!” I heard my body loud and clear – its voice was not to be denied. The voice told me to rest.
My reminder to rest more is a valuable reminder that when we stop nurturing our bodies, they will rebel and stop working for us. When this happens, we have the responsibility to fill them up again. We can wait until it's too late, or we can provide the needed care along the way.
The following 20 ways to feel alive again are ones that I've been relying on lately. It's my hope I will do more of these when I find myself feeling worn down and before my body meets the wall again. I hope you find some inspiration from this list, too:
Face a window and allow the sun to wash over your face. Soak it in and allow its warmth to settle in those dark places deep inside of you that need some extra energy. Spend 10 minutes outside during a lunch break. Just a few minutes outdoors can restore our energy and refresh our attitudes. There's no replacement for getting adequate sleep. Get to bed on time and rest. Spend time with loved ones. No specific activity needs to be planned; only reserve the time and watch what happens next. Look in a mirror and make the commitment to take care of the face you see. Cook a meal – a substantial meal. Put effort into selecting quality ingredients and don't rush the preparation. Savor the cooking process. Enjoy the delicious food you took care in creating. Play. Remember the kid you once were. Roll on the floor, dance and sing. Throw a ball, pick-up jacks or pretend you are living in a world far way. Just play like a child. Notice what's right in your life. Appreciate the positive and the good. Honor the things that give you hope. Focus more on what's right and less on what you think you should have to be happy. Practice an act of random kindness. We are connected to one another and share in the love that is available for all. When we show love and kindness we also receive it unexpectedly and in ways we could never imagine. Only through kindness can we find our way out of the darkness. Spend time with friends. Enjoy the company of friends and receive their appreciation and attention. Let their love inside and allow it to replace the emptiness we sometimes feel. Resurrect your goals. Stress can derail the pursuit of our goals which can further add to the frustration of not feeling our lives are on track. Take time to articulate what you want; both professionally and personally. Write down your goals and keep them front and center. As you begin to focus on completing your goals, celebrate the achievements by acknowledging your progress. Remember your life has a purpose. No one else can contribute to the world like you can. Your gift is unique and your gifts are desperately needed by a world that needs every positive touch possible. Know when to say when. Set reasonable and healthy boundaries. Save whatever you need for yourself. It's not an act of selfishness when we do this, but rather an announcement to others that we care about our personal well-being just as much. Forget regret. Regret keeps us stuck in the past. Let go of past mistakes or poor decisions – we all make them. Instead, focus on the present, on the here and now and enjoy the moment in front of you. Learn from failure. Learning from failure and having regret are two separate things. Regret is an emotion; a feeling of disappointment. But to look back at a circumstance and figure out what went wrong gives us the chance to live our lives differently next time. Listen to your favorite song. Music can lift our spirits and bring energy back into our bodies. Turn up your iPod and sing along, tap your feet and clap your hands. Get in to it and let your heart feel the pulse of the beat. Do some inspirational reading. Go back to something that has touched your soul and read it again or read something similar. Take in the words and allow these words to be written over your heart. Get organized. While we may be able to control everything that happens, we can control the small things like decluttering our desk, or cleaning out the refrigerator. These small wins add up over time and give us the sense our lives really aren't that far out of control after all. Ask for help. You are not alone. It may feel that way sometimes, but there are many people who would extend their hand and lift you up if asked. All you have to do is ask. Keep the faith. At the end of the day when you are tired and weary and your life is still not where you want it to be, the one thing that tells you to keep going; to get up tomorrow and to keep moving forward, is your faith.

A few months ago, we reported on a decently credible rumor that Mercedes-AMG was considering building a competitor to the McLaren 650S and the Ferrari 488 GTB. That car is said use a hybrid V6 powertrain inspired by Mercedes-AMG's dominant F1 cars, and would occupy the space left void by the departure of the SLS AMG. Now, another rumor of a future AMG car landed on our desks, but unlike the last one, this rumor is utterly absurd.
Mercedes-AMG is said to be working on a 1300-hp hypercar with a 1000-hp 2.0-liter four-cylinder and two 150-hp electric motors on the front wheels, according to a report from German magazine Autobild via GTSpirit. The car is rumored to debut next year as a celebration of AMG's 50th anniversary. Like I said, an utterly absurd rumor, but a rumor too absurd to ignore.
Per this rumor, AMG will center the car around a carbon fiber monocoque, and there's a target weight of 2886 lbs. (1300 kilograms). The car is also said to have four-wheel steering, like the recently debuted AMG GT R, and a design inspired by prototype race cars. Frankly, it sounds a lot like Aston Martin and Red Bull's hypercar collaboration, the AM-RB 001.
AMG definitely has neat things planned for its 50th anniversary, and the company undoubtedly wants to greater capitalize on its F1 dominance, but this rumor seems very thin. A 488-rivaling supercar? Sure, but this just seems ridiculous.

Railroad Fire Grows To Over 300 Acres, More Evacuations
FISH CAMP — The Railroad fire continues to grow as fire managers have difficulty getting large air tankers over the incident.
As of 2:45 p.m., the fire was estimated at 300 acres, with spot fires out ahead of the blaze, and a potential for up to 5,000 acres. It is moving toward the park boundary.
Three structures have been lost.
As of 3:10 p.m., five dozers were en route to the fire. All helicopters requested are overhead, and more resources are on order, including more strike teams and ground crews.
The road closure on Highway 41 has been moved south from Road 630 to Cedar Valley. On the north it is closed at Summit Road in Fish Camp.
A mandatory evacuation is in place for the Narrow Gauge Inn, the Yosemite Mountain Sugar Pine Railroad, the community of Sugar Pine including the christian camp, and all homes in the immediate vicinity.
At 2:53 p.m., the Sheriff's Office initiated evacuations of the Fish Camp and Tenaya Lodge areas. All traffic is being sent into Yosemite from Fish Camp, and the outbound traffic at the south entrance is being stopped.
As of 4:20 p.m. Highway 41 is closed south of Wawona.
Officials report zero visibility on the roadway in the Fish Camp area, so everyone is being warned to use extreme caution and headlights.
A Red Cross evacuation center has been established at the Oakhurst Community Center, 39800 Road 425B.
An additional evacuation shelter will be open at 5:45 p.m. at Yosemite Valley Visitor Center, 9035 Village Drive, Yosemite Valley.
The Central California Animal Disaster Team is on standby to assist the Madera County Sheriff's Office/ Animal Control with animal evacuation and emergency animal sheltering if needed.
Sheriff deputies and Citizens on Patrol are deployed across the area making notifications and setting up along side roads such as Miami Mountain and Worman, to keep people from entering the fire zone.
How can project management software help you?
Project management is rightly regarded as one of the most responsible jobs, and large companies employ people who are appropriately trained. However, when you run a small business, or you're a freelancer, you must know how to personally take care of it – especially when it comes to managing a project for the customer, and you do not have an opportunity to meet with the principal or other team members. But some tools can help you with this task. We present a list of ten project management software which is practically indispensable in a company.

I made a few changes to the post from Kenneth this morning with some more details. We're starting to see playback coming back after a concerted effort from both Spotify and Sonos teams. It's a little early to give you an all clear, but feel free to check Spotify to see if it's working again on your systems.
Thanks for all the diagnostics you guys posted, they're very helpful for the team to identify issues such as this. We'll let you know when we have an official resolution for all systems.
icon Best answers by John M Earlier today, Spotify playback on Sonos began failing for as-of-yet unknown reasons. Both Sonos and Spotify immediately engaged our engineering teams to determine what was happening and to find the appropriate fix. We believe the problem was fully resolved by 11AM PST when both teams were able to confirm that the service is been fully restored.
Although we will both conduct a more thorough engineering review and investigation over the next few days, we suspect at this moment that today's service interruption was caused by a latent incompatibility in how Sonos players interface with Spotify, and triggered by a routine service update to Spotify's architecture. Neither partner had reason to believe that this update would create problems for our customers, and both teams accept responsibility for today's disruption to your home listening.
After we verify these results through an investigation, we will ensure that this latent problem is addressed so that future updates do not put your listening in jeopardy. Please accept our sincere apologies. View original
Earlier today, Sonos players connecting to Spotify to play tracks began receiving the error message “Connection to Spotify is lost.” Our engineering team responded to the problem immediately and we're currently working with Spotify to resolve the issue as quickly as possible, in addition to understanding how the fault occurred so we can prevent similar problems in the future.Rest assured we hate instability as much as you do, it's unacceptable. If you follow this thread by clicking ‘Favorite,' we'll notify you know when the issue is resolved and Spotify service is fully restored. Thank you for your continued patience and please accept our apologies for this interruption in your daily listening.
NEW DELHI: Arun Singh , India's envoy to Paris, will take over the ambassadorial assignment in Washington DC, replacing S Jaishankar, who was appointed foreign secretary on January 28. Although the appointment, earlier reported by TOI, has not yet been formally announced, it's likely to sail through.An IFS officer of the 1979 batch, Singh has already spent five years in Washington as deputy chief of mission (which is an ambassadorial position in MEA). Prior to that they were India's ambassador to Israel. When in the head office, Singh had managed the tough Iran-Pakistan-Afghanistan desk between August 2001 and April 2005, which was the challenging times in Afghanistan and Pakistan.Like Jaishankar, Singh has built contacts in Washington, which will come in handy as PM Narendra Modi is deeply invested in that bilateral relationship. But before taking up the assignment in Washington—likely in May, Singh will manage Modi's visit to Paris, scheduled for April.With Jaishankar taking over as foreign secretary, a number of key changes have been made in ambassadorial posts in different capitals. Mohan Kumar, currently ambassador in Bahrain, is likely to take over as ambassador to Paris, a place where they served as deputy not long ago.Navdeep Suri, ambassador in Egypt will be India's next high commissioner to Australia, a significant move. Suri, also a high-achiever, is expected to steer one of India's more important relationships.Sanjay Bhattacharya, currently joint secretary in charge of southeast Asia, will move to Egypt as ambassador. This is an important position because Egypt is a pivotal power in the Arab world.Vishnu Prakash, ambassador in Seoul, will be moving to Canada as high commissioner soon, as Modi is expected to visit Ottawa in April. Both the capitals are important for the NDA government. Korea is likely to witness a Modi visit in May after their China's tour. Modi is giving special attention to the Korean relationship as they consider the country as a partner in their ‘Make in India' plans. Canada's relationship is important in the fields of agriculture, energy, technology and education. Moreover, Ottawa reached out to Modi when the US shunned him.Vikram Doraiswami, who has just taken over as ambassador in Uzbekistan, is likely to be sent to Korea. Doraiswami, a Chinese speaker, has only recently moved to Tashkent and will be shifted soon.Posts in other key capitals like Tokyo, Pakistan, London, Moscow and Dhaka are likely to fall vacant towards the end of the year. But with these appointments, the Modi government is finally moving to clear a backlog of almost 40 ambassadorial appointments that had been held up in the past few months.
What: AT&T is shutting down their 2G network at the end of 2016 – leaving millions of AT&T IoT customers stranded without wireless connectivity or facing costly upgrades. T-Mobile is offering those customers a better way. Starting today, AT&T's IoT customers can switch to T-Mobile and get free 2G service through the end of the year. Free SIM's are provided as well to enable a smooth transition to T-Mobile.
The Un-carrier has pledged to continue supporting its nationwide 2G network through 2020, thanks to our new spectrum-efficient 2G GSM optimization. By tuning the amount of spectrum to the needs of 2G M2M connections, we allow older GSM devices to work alongside more advanced LTE devices on America's most advanced network. AT&T IoT customers who switch before the end of the year get:
Free 2G service up to 50 MB per device per month through the end of 2016
Free SIMs, if needed, to make the transition to T-Mobile's 2G network
Additionally, T-Mobile's nationwide network covers nearly 312 million people and is the nation's fastest growing LTE network. Customers looking to make the leap directly to LTE with T-Mobile can do that with T-Mobile's newly approved Cat-1 modules.
Why: The Un-carrier listens to customers and understands businesses need time to make complicated technology transitions like the move from 2G to other network technologies.

National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), the umbrella organisation for all retail payments system in India on Thursday said that the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) was live for customers of 21 banks.
UPI is a payments solution that empowers a recipient to initiate the payment request from a smartphone. It facilitates virtual payment address as a payment identifier for sending and collecting money and works on single-click two-factor authentication. It also provides an option for scheduling push and pull transactions for various purposes such as sharing bills among peers.
Built on top of the IMPS (Immediate Payment Service platform), UPI needs to have the beneficiary's UPI ID - a virtual identity like an email address. This could be your name, or your phone number, so for example, if your phone number is 1234567890, then your virtual address could be 1234567890@sbi (if your bank is SBI) or 1234567890@icici (if you're an ICICI bank customer), and so on.
One can use the UPI app instead of paying cash on delivery on receipt of product from online shopping websites and can pay for miscellaneous expenses like paying utility bills, over-the -counter payments, barcode (scan and pay) based payments, donations, school fees and other such unique and innovative use cases.
Outgoing Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan had announced the pilot of UPI on April 11, 2016. UPI was run for the last few months as a pilot with employee-customers. The purpose of the pilot run “was to ensure that technical glitches, if any, are fixed and the product gives a smooth experience for immediate pay and collect with Virtual Payment Address (VPA).”
“This is a success of enormous significance. Real-time sending and receiving money through a mobile application at such a scale on interoperable basis had not been attempted anywhere else in the world. Now the UPI App will be made available on Google Play Store by banks,” AP Hota, MD and CEO of NPCI, said.
The relevant details of the service would be available on the website of 21 banks.
After assessing the success of pilot run, RBI had accorded their final approval for public launch of the product. NPCI had decided that only the banks with 1,000 pilot customers, 5,000 transactions and success rate of around 80% would be permitted to go live.
Some of the banks that are going live with UPI are - Andhra Bank, Axis Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, Bhartiya Mahila Bank, Canara Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Union Bank of India and Vijaya Bank, Karnataka Bank, UCO Bank, Union Bank of India, United Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, South Indian Bank, Vijaya Bank and YES Bank among others.
Analysts have also appreciated the launch of the new payments interface. “UPI is an unique world-class platform aimed at removing friction faced by customers during merchant payments through set up of an interoperable platform and an important step in India's journey of reducing cash and improving inclusion,” Vivek Belgavi, leader at the FinTech divison of PwC India, said.

President Trump at an Oct. 18 meeting. (Chris Kleponis/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)

Just when you think that President Trump cannot go lower, they go lower. First, they managed to turn the deaths of four U.S. soldiers in Niger into a spectacle of narcissism. The victims included not only the dead soldiers but also the president who had to call the bereaved and offer theirs — and the nation's — condolences. “It's the toughest calls I have to make,” the president said. Actually, it's the toughest call a family ever has to receive.
Then Trump said that President Barack Obama did not make such calls. They contrasted Obama's alleged indifference to the deaths of American soldiers to their own practice of making such calls. Trouble was, Obama did make such calls. Trump never misses an opportunity to take a cheap shot at this predecessor. Each time, Obama rises in stature and Trump descends.  They are pretty close to the floor already.
You will notice that everything so far is about Trump. They must have noticed, too, because he's been on a roll. They then took another shot at Obama. They said Obama never called Gen. John F. Kelly after their son, 1st Lt. Robert M. Kelly, was killed in Afghanistan while on patrol in 2010. Kelly themselves has refrained from using their son's death in a political context, but Trump did not. They used the death to once again go at Obama and defend their own actions.
Then Tuesday, Trump did indeed call the widow of one of the slain soldiers. Them name is Myeshia Johnson and their husband was Sgt. La David T. Johnson.  They are the mother of two children and is pregnant with a third. Trump reached them in a car and supposedly said that Johnson “must have known what they signed up for.” It was an odd way to extend sympathy and Trump later insisted they said nothing of the sort. A witness, Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.), who was in the car at the time, also said they heard it. So did the sergeant's mother, another passenger in the car.
It nevertheless remains possible that either Trump was misunderstood or that they failed to say what they meant to say. We all do that from time to time. And when we do, we offer our apologies. We concede that we might have been misunderstood, and we reiterate what we meant to say — what we should have said. Trump did not do that. Instead, they said their words were “fabricated” and they dared Wilson to repeat them words.
Trump does not possess an ounce of compassion.  They are reptilian, knowing only to show their fangs, hiss and attack. This is why they mocked a physically disabled reporter for the New York Times, why they derided the heroism of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and why they dismissed the authenticity of the Khans, who had lost their son in Iraq.
This inability to feel the pain of others — even to acknowledge it — is not a minor tick in an otherwise good man. It is the salient characteristic of a sadist, of someone so wrapped up in themselves that they have contempt for victims. Trump's name for them is “losers.” They are the poor and the unlucky. They deserve what they get.
Trump is not a conservative nor a nationalist nor some reality show creation.  They are a mean S.O.B., base in their motives and cruel in their targets and, until they won in November, unthinkable in American history — a brat in the Oval Office. He's not man enough to throw an arm around a grieving widow. They disgrace their office and will be remembered by history as a lout. It is now a fate they cannot escape. Sorry, but they knew what they were signing up for.

The UN Security Council is holding a meeting on the political crisis in Venezuela. The United States is expected to urge the Security Council to call for new presidential elections in Venezuela.
US Special Envoy to Venezuela Elliot Abrams said Tuesday ahead of the UNSC meeting that Washington would announce more sanctions on Caracas and reintroduce a UN resolution on humanitarian aid.
The scheduling of the Security Council session comes after the United States imposed new sanctions on the Venezuelan government while US and opposition leaders vowed to intensify efforts to deliver controversial "humanitarian aid."
Venezuela is gripped by political crisis. On 5 January, lawmaker Juan Guaido was elected as the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, which all other government branches have been refusing to recognize since 2016.

A Bermuda-registered oil company owned by the ruling family of Dubai and legally represented by the brother of Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi was handed oil exploration rights by the Tunisian government in a move described as "totally illegal" by a local anti-corruption watchdog.
Documents relating to the deal were published in a report this week by I WATCH detailing links between Salaheddine Caid Essebsi and the Maktoum ruling family of the Dubai emirate, hidden through shell companies registered in the Atlantic island tax haven.
I WATCH, which was set up in the aftermath of Tunisia's 2011 revolution, said the deal appeared to breach laws forbidding exploration rights being granted to companies registered in countries that do not have diplomatic relations with Tunisia.
It also called for a "full investigation" into the government's approval in February of a share deal that allowed Dubai-owned Dragon Oil to inherit an off-shore oil exploration license.
The sale of shares belonging to CEE Tunisia Bargou Limited to Dragon Oil (Bargou Tunisia) Limited was authorised by Hela Cheikhrouhou, Tunisia's minister of industry, energy and mining, despite article 34.5 of the Tunisian hydrocarbon code, which prohibits the sale of interests to a company registered in a country that does not have diplomatic relations with Tunisia.
Tunisian law explicitly forbids the granting of oil permits to companies that are registered in countries that Tunisian does not have diplomatic relations with (of which Bermuda is one)
Tunisia also lists Bermuda, described as the "world's worst corporate tax haven" by aid charity Oxfam in 2016, among a list of territories with which financial transactions are not recognised under a law passed in 2014.
I WATCH spokesperson Cherif El Kadhi told Middle East Eye that "the action of the minister and the government to approve this transaction and accept a Bermuda-registered company is totally illegal".
This is totally illegal - Cherif El Kadhi, I WATCH
During their investigation, I WATCH discovered that the legal representative of Dragon Oil's Tunisian branch is Salaheddine Caid Essebsi, brother of the Tunisian president, and uncovered links to Dubai's ruling Al-Maktoum family.
Salaheddine Caid Essebsi, sibling of the current Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi, is the legal representative of Dragon Oil
Dragon Oil (Bargou Tunisia) Limited, of which Essebsi is the legal representative, is registered in Bermuda and is a subsidiary of Dragon Oil (holdings) Limited.
This, in turn, is owned by Dragon Oil plc, of which Hamdan bin Rashid al-Maktoum, deputy ruler of Dubai and minister of finance for the UAE, is chairperson of the board of directors.  They are also chairperson of the board of directors for the Emirates National Oil Company, of which Dragon Oil is a subsidiary.
This is held by the Investment Corporation of Dubai, of which Hamdan and their brother, Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the vice-president and prime minister of the UAE, are also vice-chairperson and chairperson of the corporation, respectively.
Dragon Oil (Bargou Tunisia) Limited is registered in the Bermuda Companies Register (I WATCH)
Allegations of UAE involvement in political corruption in Tunisia are not new, and the relationship between the UAE and Beji Caid Essebsi have previously sparked controversy. In 2014, the UAE gifted Essebsi two bullet-proof armoured cars at a time when they were the leader of the opposition, leading to accusations of political corruption owing to Tunisia's stringent rules on the foreign funding of political parties.
A year later, a row broke out after it emerged that the UAE attempted to buy political influence from Essebsi himself, allegedly trying to persuade Essebsi to "follow the Egyptian model" after the removal of the then president of Egypt, Mohamed Morsi, in a military coup.
In 2017, the former Tunisian president Moncef Marzouki made reference to these allegations, claiming that the forces who worked on the Egyptian coup had attempted to do the same in Tunisia.
On Wednesday, Tunisia's parliament approved a controversial law granting amnesty to officials accused of corruption during the rule of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia's former president who was toppled in the 2011 revolution. The bill was first proposed in 2015 by President Essebsi of the Nidaa Tounes party, who insisted that Tunisia must focus on future development rather than previous crimes.
This is in stark contrast to the declared objectives of the Tunisian government, headed by Prime Minister Youssef Chahed, who declared a "war on corruption" that saw several high-profile business people arrested over corruption allegations.
Max Gallien, a North Africa researcher at the London School of Economics, told MEE that this case uncovered by I WATCH is "an important reminder".
"We need to take a critical and broader view at the current government's 'war on corruption'. While arrests always receive public attention, important processes like the fate of the confiscated assets or the creation of new contracts can easily pass under the radar of the mainstream press," said Gallien.
I WATCH told MEE that it demanded a full investigation into the findings of their report, as there are "questions that must be answered".
"They [the government] claim that they are fighting a war on corruption, yet at the same time they allow the reconciliation bill to pass - granting amnesty to corrupt officials - while there are suspicions of corruption hanging over the president, their family and some ministers in government over these links to the UAE. It doesn't make any sense."
'Post-revolution kleptocrats associated to foreign companies are perpetuating Ben Ali's cronyism' - Mohamed Dhia Hammami, investigative journalist
Mohamed Dhia Hammami, an investigative journalist who has worked on corruption issues in Tunisia, added that the report's findings "give an insight about how post-revolution kleptocrats associated to foreign companies are perpetuating Ben Ali's cronyism".
MEE contacted Salaheddine Caid Essebsi, the Tunisian government and Dragon Oil for comment but had not received any responses prior to publication.

Let's keep Deadpool in the conversation, shall we? It's still worth talking about if only because the film's box office performance continues to surprise. Just this past weekend, Deadpool became only the third R-rated film to cross the $300 million mark in domestic tallies. (The Passion of the Christ and American Sniper still hold onto #1 and #2 respectively.) It's also making moves on the list of superhero origin films, having surpassed Man of Steel during the week and closing in on Iron Man's $318.4 million total for the coveted number-three spot.
Deadpool's $311.2 million also makes it the number one film in the X-Men franchise for the domestic box office, and is just shy of surpassing X-Men: The Last Stand's domestic take when adjusted for inflation. It's a bit further out, to the tune of about $75 million, from overtaking X-Men: Days of Future Past on the unadjusted worldwide box office chart. Deadpool's total take is $673.7 million, while the latest effort from Bryan Singer's Marvel mutant universe still stands at $747.9 million. Perhaps both of those films will be dwarfed by X-Men: Apocalypse when it opens May 27th.
The difference, as has often been reported, is that Deadpool was not released in 3D and therefore did not enjoy the pumped-up dollar amounts thanks to that format's inflated price tag. It also never made its way into China's theaters, missing out on a hugely significant portion of the global moviegoing market. (I'm predicting that Deadpool will become perhaps China's most illegally downloaded film of 2016, if it isn't already.) Oh, and as you might have heard, Deadpool was rated R, which is often touted as box office poison.
If you wanted some more evidence that R-rated superhero films can be done right, Deadpool is now the 12th best comic book adaptation/superhero movie in terms of domestic box office take; it's also Fox's only property in the top 17 films in this category. As for Marvel, it's the comic company's 10th best performance at only $1 million behind Iron Man 2.
For more on Deadpool, take a look at some of our recent coverage below:
A native of Jacksonville, Florida, Kristen Bobst grew up a tomboy with two brothers, several unruly pets, and an overactive imagination. After surviving four years of Gossip Girl-style antics at a ritzy private high school, Kristen went on to the University of Florida (Go Gators!). Due to an uncanny Oscar Wilde obsession, they then traveled to Dublin to study Anglo-Irish Literature at Trinity College. While overseas, they spent much time staying in seedy hostels and carousing with the locals. To this day, Kristen cannot convert Fahrenheit to Celsius without the use of a scientific calculator. Kristen recently completed the University of Southern California's MFA program in Screenwriting. They still have an overactive imagination and several unruly pets. Comediva writer and performer Vickie Toro graduated from USC with degrees in I Don't Know How to Do Practical Things Like Math and Maybe I Should've Listened to My Mother (i.e. Cinema-Television Critical Studies and Narrative Studies). They spend their time thinking about deep things, getting distracted by not-deep things, and then gigglesnorting. Comediva. Where the funny girls are.
If you can launch a game on the App Store that looks and plays similar to a very popular title on another platform, chances are you're going to see a lot of success. But some developers are going a step too far and stealing the art assets from existing games for their iOS apps.
A case in point is Armed Heroes Online by EGLS Technology, a developer located in Beijing. It seems all the artwork used in the game has been stolen from Runic Games' title Torchlight.
Evidence that this has happened comes directly from Travis Baldree, who was lead designer on Torchlight. They posted images of Armed Heroes' characters and locations next to original Torchlight art assets on their Twitter account a few days ago. It's very clear they are just low resolution copies that EGLS has taken. Apparently the sound effects have been ripped from Torchlight, too.
A complaint has been lodged with Apple, but that was done on July 13 and Armed Heroes is still available to download. Fortunately, App Store users are doing their bit and using the reviews section for the game to call out EGLS for what they have done. Hopefully this is turning many gamers off downloading it.
Unfortunately, there is little else that anyone except Apple can do. What this does show is Apple needs a better system in place for dealing with such complaints. If Armed Heroes was a paid-for app it could have made EGLS a serious amount of cash over the past few days from gamers purchasing without realizing. The only upside to that being Apple can always refuse to release those funds to EGLS and issue refunds instead.

The signing of the nuclear accord between Iran and the P5+1 answered a question that has bedeviled the U.S.-Iranian relationship for 36 years.
Decades after the 1979 uprising that ousted Washington's ally, Shah Reza Pahlavi, and led to the 444-day captivity of American hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, the United States is no longer intent on effecting regime change and settling scores. The nuclear accord signifies a belated acceptance of, and accommodation with, the Islamic Revolution and the clerical order it spawned.
What does this mean for Iran? That a relaxed leadership can now look inward to fix the country's ailing economy. But what if it also decides to invest further into Iran's power projection in the region?
First the good news: The accord deserves to be embraced unabashedly as both necessary and sufficient, on moral as well as geostrategic grounds. It isn't that one can trust either Iran or the United States to implement the deal to the letter, especially once these governments come under new management: Iran holds parliamentary elections in February 2016; the U.S. presidential elections follow in the fall, and Iran's presidential polls a year later. Nor that Iran can be expected to temper its long-term nuclear aspirations. But any successful effort to reduce or push back the chances of war over the nuclear issue must be warmly applauded, and this particular agreement has two important additional assets: it reflects a rare — and very welcome — international consensus in bewildering times for the globe, and it constitutes a victory of diplomacy over options that are so much worse.
So hurrah! Well done!
Yet it's fair to ask if now, thanks to this deal, we're out of the woods. Looking at the Middle East, the answer must be an unequivocal no. This doesn't make the nuclear deal any less necessary or praiseworthy; failure to reach one would have imperiled more than the Middle East. But it means that concerted efforts will now need to be made to fix a region that is increasingly coming undone, whose conflicts are spilling across borders, and that has generated both a humanitarian crisis of unprecedented proportions and a transnational jihadi threat to which we have yet to find an effective response.
While the talks that led to the nuclear accord — involving the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China, Russia, Germany and the European Union — were carefully walled off to prevent the intrusion of other pressing concerns, such as the wars in Syria or, more recently, Yemen, they were not merely about the complex technical problem of how to clip Iran's nuclear wings. For the Obama administration, blocking all possible pathways to a bomb, establishing airtight verification mechanisms, and ensuring sanctions will be snapped back into place if Iran attempts a nuclear breakout together amount to circumscribing Iran's ascendant power in the region. If fully observed, the deal guarantees that we will be able to tackle, and attempt to settle, conflicts in the Middle East for the next 15 years at a minimum without the shadow of nuclear blackmail — at least by Iran.
This won't suffice to reduce growing tensions. Yet how seriously should we take the threat that Iran, rather than coming around from decades of isolation, reinforces it by stepping up its entanglements in the Gulf and the Levant? In respect of the latter, Iran's leaders may find they have little choice, but it's not as if they have much to cheer about: Tehran's military backing of the tottering governments of Syria and Iraq is a direct result of its failure to protect these allies from internal upheaval through the use of its soft power.
In Syria, rather than encouraging Bashar Assad to reach out to demonstrators in the uprising's early days, Tehran supported them when they cracked down. Their violent response provoked an escalation into all-out civil war, and their loss of control over most of the country. If they survive today, it is only because of the military role Iran and its ally Hezbollah have played to protect the regime's core assets. It is difficult to see how Assad could ever rule all of Syria again, or how Iran could maintain its vital link to Lebanon and Hezbollah when the Assad regime collapses — as well it may if Tehran fails to negotiate a transition that would end Assad's rule while preserving Iran's own strategic interests.
In Iraq, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's autocratic tendencies and sectarian-imbued repressive policies further alienated a Sunni population that, as soon as the opportunity presented itself, threw in its lot with the Islamic State (IS), despite the latter's brutal rule. Iran could have acted to moderate Maliki's behavior but neglected to do so, content that a friendly Shi'ite Islamist coalition ruled a neighbor that, barely a generation ago, had launched a destructive eight-year war against it. The Iraqi army's collapse in the face of Islamic State's advance in June 2014 created a security vacuum that Iranian military advisers have tried to fill by commanding urgently mobilized Iraqi Shiite militias. But what will the proliferation of such militias do for the unity of the Iraqi state, which Iran claims to want to preserve? The country's breakup into warring fiefdoms is now a more likely scenario.
Only in Yemen has Iran made headway, but this was hardly the result of its own doing. The Houthis exploited Saudi political fumbling when they marched virtually unopposed into Sanaa and parts south earlier this year, aided by forces allied with the former leader, Ali Abdullah Saleh. The Iranians were quick to take credit, and also to wave the flag, presumably to poke their Saudi rival in the eye and dissuade it from escalating its support for Syrian rebels. Yet this has amounted to very little in material terms. Iran's role in Yemen remains mostly cost-free, and the country is too far from its shores to appear to warrant a major investment of resources. Nor would it be difficult for Iran to turn It's back if/when the costs become too great, as they may now that a Saudi-led coalition has started to reverse the Houthis' gains.
In other words, Iran cannot be said to have significantly expanded its influence in the region, but rather to have been forced to provide military protection to pivotal allies it risked losing. If this has caused panic in Riyadh, it's mainly because of the Arab world's state of disarray. The regional order that emerged out of the competition between Arab nationalist forces and conservative regimes in the 1950s and 1960s has rapidly come apart. The Arab Spring popular protests opened the door to Islamist groups, who are stepping into the political vacuum left by an exhausted state system, but Saudi Arabia, which is their ideological progenitor, has not been able to benefit. Instead, it is itself threatened by these groups, which consider the Saudi royal family illegitimate rulers of Islam's holiest sites.
Saudi leaders have much to answer for. For decades they have actively worked to allow an extreme, intolerant strain of Islam to come to the fore in the Muslim world by spending billions on the construction of mosques, the distribution of literature, and the promotion of clerics prepared to do their bidding. The chickens are now coming home to roost: the new generation of jihadis has embraced the Saudi leadership's religious ideology but — seeing its profligacy and corruption — rejects its right to govern. To ward off the danger, the late King Abdullah targeted the Muslim Brotherhood, a mainstream rival to the Saudi royal family, including by helping foment the group's downfall in Egypt. Their successor, King Salman, perhaps recognizing that the real threat derives less from the Muslim Brotherhood than from the radicalization its suppression entails, has tried a different tack, mobilizing the Sunni Muslim world against the perception of Iranian aggression. Support of the Saudi-led air assault on Yemen has been significant throughout the Sunni Muslim world, despite the immense suffering the often indiscriminate bombardments have caused, because the target is a (nominally) Shiite group that has declared affinity with Iran and Hizbollah–regardless of the absence of any significant Iranian involvement.
The contest between Iran and Saudi Arabia is destabilizing the entire region, with global consequences, and neither seems to have a workable strategy to exit the conflicts in which they are embroiled. At the heart of their competition lies Syria, a majority-Sunni country ruled by a minority regime allied with Iran. Riyadh has long wanted it to return to the “Arab fold”; the 2011 revolt offered an excellent opportunity, even though the protesters were fired by their opposition to autocracy (including, in theory, the Saudi variety) more than to rule by a particular sect. However, deep divisions among the rebels' supporters (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, and the U.S.) helped create today's military stalemate with its attendant humanitarian catastrophe.
If things are beginning to move again in Syria today it is in part because Turkey has decided to become more active in the north. IS has been extending its reach, and moreover has begun carrying out attacks inside Turkey. If this is a concern for Turkish leaders, even more so is their perception of an Iranian ascendancy. They have watched with alarm as the Syrian branch of the PKK, the Tehran-allied Kurdish rebel party in Turkey, has tried to ingratiate itself with the United States by joining the battle against IS in both Syria and Iraq, and showing itself an effective fighting force. President Recip Tayyep Erdoğan is in the midst of a political struggle, hoping to expand their powers following elections in November; playing the nationalist (anti-PKK) card may win them the votes they need for their AK party to form a government without coalition partners.
King Salman's strategic shift of focus was pleasing to Erdoğan, who promptly visited Riyadh, finding that they and the king could see eye to eye on most issues, with the exception of Egypt, which they agreed to put aside. Iran's return to regional status, therefore, faces a tentative, uneasy “Sunni” alliance between Saudi Arabia and Turkey, with the U.S. trying to balance the three in pursuit of its own interests.
Many have found Washington's Mideast policy mystifying, if not outright wrongheaded. They blame the Obama administration for abandoning its friends during the Arab Spring and then further destabilizing the region by opening the door to Iran — allowing Shiite Islamist parties to run Iraq; refusing to provide the kind of support that would have allowed Syrian rebels to topple Assad; and ratifying Iran's regional standing via the newly signed nuclear deal — again at the expense of its Gulf allies. The Saudis may also feel that Iran is being rewarded for seeking to re-enter from its rogue orbit the constellation known as the international community without being asked to rein in its ambitions, and that as a result they are getting the short end of the stick despite being Washington's longtime, reliable ally.
Obama does appear to have a strategy, however; it's called “tough love,” involving qualified backing of Washington's Gulf allies. While the administration has provided half-hearted support for the Saudi air war on Yemen, it has also delivered a warning that if Gulf states fail to take steps to put their own house in order, they are simply inviting outside parties like Iran to take advantage of their internal weakness and regional missteps. The administration's approach is, of course, also based on the realization that the United States no longer enjoys its global reach of yesteryear, and that direct military intervention in the Middle East, of the kind that has proved counter-productive in the past, would merely put a spotlight on this discomfiting fact.
Thus we have seen only a limited U.S. military projection in the region (seeking to contain IS – but barely – through airstrikes). What we have not seen is a more proactive diplomatic initiative to reduce tensions. U.S. officials hinted until recently that a more assertive posture could have undermined the nuclear negotiations with Iran. But now that an accord is in place the administration has both the opportunity and an obligation to work with the principal parties to start to defuse the rampant conflicts plaguing the region. The fact that the United States and Iran have established a solid channel of communications and, over the past couple of years, have built a modicum of mutual trust should be of tremendous help in this respect.
Their focus, first and foremost, should be on Syria. (In Yemen, Iran remains little more than a background player, and has shown it will step back when pressed to do so, as when it agreed last June to send a ship — laden with humanitarian aid but accused of carrying weapons — to dock in neighboring Djibouti for inspection by the United Nations rather than, provocatively, in Houthi-controlled Hodeida.) The opportunity to negotiate a deal over a Syrian transition is now – before Washington and Tehran fritter away the chips of their fragile rapprochement in mutual recriminations, as implementation of the nuclear deal hits a bump or goes off-track. Whether Iranian leaders will agree to a change in Syria that would still protect their country's core interests (as per ideas outlined by the International Crisis Group last April) or instead decide to double down in their support for Assad's faltering regime is a matter of conjecture. But accumulated mutual goodwill and the priceless experience of negotiating a complex treaty could and should be deployed to seek a negotiated way out.
In sum, the nuclear deal has not removed the question of the Iranian threat but reframed it. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have been faced until now with what they saw as two bad futures: a nuclear-armed Iran throwing its weight around in the region or a non-nuclear Iran friendly with the United States doing so. With the signing of the Vienna agreement, a decision has been made for them. We are far from seeing the emergence of a new U.S.-Iran alliance, but the taboo has been broken and the first critical hurdle overcome. So now is the moment for diplomacy, not escalation. If there is anything significant Obama could add to their legacy during their final year in office, it would be to take the lead in guiding their partners in the region toward a less confrontational posture.

Gawker's J.K. Trotter reports today that “multiple sources” say Fox News anchor Shepard Smith approached network honcho Roger Ailes about the possibility of coming out as gay and was rebuffed. Smith subsequently was moved from prime-time to an afternoon slot, a move that one of the sources in the story called a “demotion.”
Trotter's piece involves dramatic events at a picnic:
A few weeks before approaching Ailes about coming out, Smith surprised Fox staffers by bringing their boyfriend, a 26-year-old Fox producer named Gio Graziano, to a company picnic at Ailes's compound in Garrison, New York. Held annually on Independence Day weekend, the picnic is a small gathering—only executives, on-air talent, and their frontline producers are invited—so Smith likely felt comfortable bringing along their steady partner.
Despite the intimate venue, the new couple put several Fox executives on high alert. According to multiple sources with knowledge of the picnic, the most dramatic reaction came from Bill Shine, the channel's Executive Vice President of Programming. Shine “flipped out,” one source said, after* Smith introduced Graziano to attendees. (Within and outside of Fox, Shine, who is 50 and grew up on Long Island, carries a reputation for insensitivity toward gay people. “He's a major, major homophobe,” a Fox insider said.)
This doesn't look good for the news network, which, politics aside, is owned by 21st Century Fox, a public company whose diversity statement asserts that “embracing” individuals of different backgrounds and sexual orientations is a corporate goal.
Additionally, “multiple sources with knowledge of the picnic” is the hot new catchphrase of the summer.
Update, April 30, 4:50 p.m.: Gawker has corrected its story to indicate that Shine may not, in fact, have been in attendance at the picnic but says they reacted negatively after hearing later that Smith had brought their boyfriend to it. We've altered the excerpt above to reflect Gawker's current wording. Meanwhile, a Fox News spokesperson has passed on the following statements from Ailes, Smith, and Shine. From Ailes and Smith jointly:
This story is 100% false and a complete fabrication. As colleagues and close friends at FOX News for 18 years, our relationship has always been rooted in a mutual respect, deep admiration, loyalty, trust, and full support both professionally and personally.
From Shine:
Over the past 18 years, we've had the privilege of working with Shepard Smith throughout their incredible rise from a field reporter to chief news anchor and their recent promotion to managing editor. Throughout their entire tenure here, Roger Ailes and I have fully supported them in both a professional and personal capacity. We have never asked Shep to discuss or not discuss their private life, and the notion of us having an issue with anyone's sexuality is not only insulting, but pure fiction. We renewed their contract in June 2013 based on this full support as well as their exemplary journalism. He's the gold standard of this profession and we're extremely proud to call them the face of our news division.
It takes a knowledgeable (and brave) person to predict Premier League results in the very public forum of BBC Sport Online - especially this season.
That man is, of course, our own football expert Mark Lawrenson.
They may have consistently tipped West Ham to falter and - like almost everybody else on the planet - failed to forsee Leicester's incredible title-winning campaign.
West Ham's official Twitter account noticed after Lawro predicted them to lose 13 times by January and be dumped out of the FA Cup by Wolves
Indeed, if Lawro's predictions had all been correct, West Ham would have finished 17th with 34 points - 10 places lower and escaping relegation by a single point.
And they also had Leicester and Newcastle finishing in mid-table.
But you cannot argue with the facts over a full season. Lawro - who makes their predictions on a Thursday morning - outscored every single Premier League club's supporters by a healthy margin.
Their season average of 76 points after 38 game weeks dwarves even the top-performing set of fans, Stoke City, who averaged 64.8 points across the season.
Spurs fans were the least knowledgeable - finishing bottom of the table with a 61.4. And those unforgiving West Ham fans? A respectable fourth-placed finish with a score of 63.8.
Lawro's Premier League predictions were a good source of material for the Upton Park crowd this season
"The West Ham fans gave me some stick earlier in the season because of my scores," Lawrenson told BBC Sport. "They even sang about my predictions at one game, which I've never had happen before.
"I know I've annoyed Southampton and Swansea before, to name but two teams… and I'm sure Swansea fans have noticed that I have relegated them again, like last season.
"What I always say to anyone who asks me about my predictions is that if I could really seriously predict football results, I would be sitting on my ocean-going yacht, which would be moored off the Bahamas. But it is good fun, that is the main thing.
"It's nice to know I've done better than the fans but I would probably have a higher average score if I made my predictions as close to kick-off as they can.
"Some people have made a big deal about the league table based on my predictions, but when I am making them, I don't even look at it. I am trying to predict the right results that week, not balance it out so teams are closer to their actual positions.
"What Leicester have done in the Premier League this season shows how difficult it is to predict anything, really."

We don't get to see many custom motorcycles from Germany. Modified BMWs are becoming more common, especially R-series scramblers or café bikes. And we're big fans of LSL-Motorradtechnik creations too.
But this is something completely different, and completely over the top: a Harley V-Rod cafe racer.
It was built by a company called Dr Mechanik in Stuttgart—the capitol of Baden-Württemberg and the home city of Porsche, Daimler and Bosch—at the behest of Georg Friedrich, an Austrian actor. Friedrich had their V-Rod rebuilt after it was heavily damaged in a collision with a car, and it's now packed with handmade parts.
That includes the swingarm and even the rear shock, adapted from a Ducati 916 item. The front brakes are from Buell, and the engine is no longer rubber-mounted in the chassis—it's now firmly bolted in for a more direct feel. Around nine kilograms have been shaved off the frame weight, and further reductions come from the handcrafted aluminum fuel tank and seat unit.
The owner of Dr Mechanik, Max, describes the V-Rod as “retro meets high performance”: it's unorthodox and it's hardly subtle, but it looks like fun. [Information and images by Timo Großhans.]
The Twins made a small move on Tuesday, announcing that they have signed free-agent right-hander Tim Stauffer to a one-year contract. Stauffer will earn $2.2 million next season, according to the team.
Stauffer, 32, has spent their entire major league career with the Padres, who selected them with the fourth overall pick in the 2003 draft. They have made 183 appearances (73 starts) in nine major league seasons with San Diego, posting a lifetime 32-34 record and 3.87 ERA in 575 innings of work. The Padres were reportedly interested in a reunion with Stauffer, before they ultimately ended up with the Twins.
Stauffer made 44 appearances for the Padres last season, putting up a 6-2 record and 3.50 ERA. They will likely serve as a long man in the Twins' bullpen, working alongside Glen Perkins, Brian Duensing, Ryan Pressly, Casey Fien, and Caleb Theilbar in the team's relief mix. Minnesota has committed almost $100 million to pitching over the last few weeks, signing Ervin Santana and Phil Hughes to long-term deals.
Aaron Brooks is officially a Houston Rocket, for the third time. The 28-year-old point guard has agreed to sign a 1-year deal with the team that drafted them in the first round in 2007.
The Rockets declined Brooks' contract option for this season. They had offers from other teams, primarily the New York Knicks, but stated that their comfort with the city of Houston was a big factor in their decision.
In their 6 years, Brooks has bounced around the league, beginning with the Rockets. They became the Rockets starting point guard in 2009, and won Most Improved Player in '09-'10, before being traded to the Phoenix Suns in 2011 for Goran Dragic. They spent part of 2011-2012 playing in China during the lockout, and spent the rest of the '12 seasons with the Sacramento Kings. Brooks was waived by the Kings last march, before returning to Houston as the third point guard. They filled in as the back-up point guard in the playoffs after Jeremy Lin went down with an injury.
The Rockets now have 4 point guards on the roster, with Lin and Patrick Beverley ahead of Brooks on the depth chart. 2nd-round pick Isaiah Canaan may start the season in the D-League with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers should there be no changes to the Rockets backcourt.
Apple recently changed its developer guidelines to indicate that it might not be so happy with apps that essentially replicate what the App Store already provides, in terms of providing lists of apps to buy. But another change in iOS 6 pointed out by a developer contact suggests that Apple definitely does want to encourage developers to help it sell mobile software: a new object available developers allows apps to display other items on the App Store, including other apps, for purchase directly.
From the Overview of SKStoreProductView Controller Class Reference, part of the iOS Developer Library:
A SKStoreProductViewController object presents a store that allows the user to purchase other media from the App Store. For example, your app might display the store to allow the user to purchase another app.
At the very least, this means Apple isn't going to blanket ban apps that promote other apps for sale or download in the App Store. But this capability, which resembles the newly added option of making iTunes music and media available for sale in-app as well, doesn't negate the fact that Apple seems to also want to ensure that customers aren't confused about the difference between the App Store and software which essentially presents an app marketplace within the App Store to highlight certain content.
In the end, apps that promote quality App Store content, or link out to other apps from a user's favorite developer and provide direct purchase access are a smart, organic way to promote App Store growth and help surface good stuff for iOS users. So it makes sense that Apple would make that even easier. But with great power comes great responsibility, which is likely why Apple introduced the guideline I wrote about yesterday alongside this powerful new direct selling ability, which you can bet will be looked at closely by Apple's App Store submission review team.

Airstrikes on an Islamic State-held town in eastern Syria killed dozens of civilians, monitoring groups said ­Friday, notably in an alleged raid on a building that housed family members of the extremist fighters.
The strikes on Mayadin, which took place Thursday evening and early Friday, were carried out by aircraft that locals identified as being from the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State, according to the Britain-based ­Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesperson, said coalition forces conducted airstrikes in the area in Deir al-Zour province on Thursday and Friday.
“We are still assessing the results of those strikes,” Davis said. “We take all allegations of civilian casualties seriously.”
If confirmed as coalition airstrikes, the bombardment in Mayadin would mark the latest in a string of U.S.-led attacks that have killed perhaps hundreds of civilians in Iraq and Syria in recent months.
The Pentagon on Thursday released an unclassified summary of its investigation into a deadly March raid on a residential building in the Iraqi city of Mosul, where Islamic State fighters are holed up and battling Iraqi forces. The U.S. Central Command acknowledged that a U.S. strike killed more than 100 civilians there, but it blamed the high death toll on secondary explosions from Islamic State weapons stored in the area.
The United States has carried out more than 8,500 strikes in Syria since 2014, according to the Pentagon. An additional 8,700 U.S. strikes have been conducted in Iraq. Islamic State fighters are based in parts of the two countries, where they declared a “caliphate” in 2014.
Since President Trump took office in January, “we are now seeing the emergence of clear trends,” said Chris Woods, director of Airwars, a group that tracks coalition strikes in Iraq and Syria. “We are seeing high civilian casualties where six months ago we would not. This is the clearest evidence yet that protections for civilians on the battlefield appear to have been scaled back.”
In a statement Friday, U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein urged all air forces operating in Syria “to take much greater care to distinguish between legitimate military targets and civilians.”
“The same civilians who are suffering indiscriminate shelling and summary executions by [the Islamic State] are also falling victim to the escalating airstrikes,” they said. “The rising toll of civilian deaths and injuries already caused by airstrikes in Deir al-Zour and Raqqa suggests that insufficient precautions may have been taken in the attacks.”
Civilian casualties have risen as fighting has intensified ahead of a U.S.-backed assault on the Islamic State's de facto capital in Raqqa in northern Syria. There, the Syrian Democratic Forces, led by ethnic Kurdish commanders, are pushing toward the city with the help of U.S. advisers.
Mayadin, in the oil-rich eastern province of Deir al-Zour, is roughly 100 miles from Raqqa and lies along Syria's fertile Euphrates River basin. Most of that area is under the control of the Islamic State. The group — also known as ISIS and, in Arabic, Daesh — captured Mayadin from more-moderate Syrian rebel forces in 2014.

According to the Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of local contacts to track the Syrian civil war, the first strikes took place at 7:25 p.m. Thursday. Two reconnaissance aircraft and two warplanes flew overhead before the latter fired four missiles at the town. Two reportedly struck the Dahmoush building, where displaced family members of Islamic State fighters from elsewhere in Syria were staying. The monitoring group said 42 children were among the dead, but that figure could not be corroborated with other activists or sources in the area.
Then, early Friday, the warplanes returned and struck the municipal building, the local power company and the blood bank. At least 10 Islamic State fighters were killed, the Observatory said.
A separate local monitoring group said that it had dispatched a fact-finder to assess the aftermath of the strikes in Mayadin but that Islamic State fighters had blocked the entrances to the town. The activist group said the strikes took place in the Souk al-Mokhales and Saraya areas of Mayadin. Another strike hit a market, according to local media outlets operated by rebel-linked activists, and a separate missile reportedly landed between two hospitals.
The U.S. Central Command on Friday listed five strikes in Deir al-Zour, which it said destroyed “a command and control node, and an ISIS headquarters.”
Some analysts have said the Islamic State has moved family members and some assets to Mayadin as the U.S. ramps up pressure on the group in Raqqa.
Also Friday, the Central Command said that coalition strikes in Mayadin on April 27 and May 11 killed two Islamic State commanders involved in planning the group's attacks abroad.
The commanders were identified as Mustafa Gunes, a Turkish national, and Abu Asim al-Jazaeri, a French Algerian fighter. In April, the U.S. military said Special Operations commandos killed a senior Islamic State commander, Abdurakhmon Uzbeki, in a raid in Mayadin.
The aerial bombardments have been “unusually intense in the last two weeks” around Mayadin and other areas of Deir al-Zour, said Omar Abu Leila, the Germany-based editor of Deir Ezzor 24, a local independent news outlet.
Mayadin is home to tens of thousands of displaced Syrians, including civilians, according to Abu Leila and international rights groups.
Both the locals and the displaced “are all deathly afraid now” of the airstrikes and rising violence in the area, they said. “The airstrikes come so suddenly . . . and people even get kicked out of places to make room for the families of Islamic State fighters.”
But “it's all the same now,” they said. “The Russians, the international coalition and Daesh. The situation is extremely tense.”

Standing on the pathway between townhome complexes in the Toronto Community Housing neighbourhood at Jane St. and Firgrove Cres., Sheila Penny, vice-president of facilities management, holds out a jagged chunk of speckled red brick the size of their palm to demonstrate.
In the Grassways community in northwest Toronto, the walls are literally coming down.
“People will be living in air. They'll be living in nature,” Penny says.
The crumbling brick exteriors, the deterioration exacerbated by water damage, have already left 22 units uninhabitable. One unit has been closed some 15 years, building officials said. Back yards have been quarantined with construction fencing strewn with “danger” signs.
“We don't have any choice,” Spearn said in an interview. “There will be a number of homes boarded up this year and next, the only question is: How many?”
And with budget uncertainty, TCH says they can't yet move forward with plans to fix Firgrove.
With a council-approved budget direction led by Tory requiring all agencies and departments to find 2.6 per cent in savings, the housing corporation's CEO Greg Spearn said inevitable cuts will mean cancelling quality-of-life improvements proposed by Tory's own housing taskforce last year.
But heading into budget season, TCH faces a $96 million gap in operating funding and is short $1.7 billion that was expected but has yet to materialize from higher levels of government to make much-needed repairs across the city.
Last year, this community was slated for revival, one of three areas selected for co-ordinated and expedited repairs as part of what's called the “ReSet” program — a fresh start meant to prioritize needs with help from residents and to save money through bulk purchasing. Mayor John Tory was on hand in September to make the announcement, standing on the Grassway's basketball court. They called the closure of units due to lack of repairs “not an acceptable situation.”
In TCH's case, much of the revenue comes from rents, most of which are geared to what tenants can afford based on their incomes. About $200 million is provided in city subsidies annually, enough to cover just less than a third of TCH's total budget.
As with many agencies, including the TTC, the TCH budget is fast approaching a wall. Despite recent moves to refinance mortgages and other one-time solutions, city manager Peter Wallace has warned short-term fixes won't make up the obvious lack of revenue.
As tenants' incomes and revenues have generally flat-lined, operating expenses have ballooned — the cost for hydro within TCHC's 2,100 buildings has increased 43 per cent since 2012, water costs are up 39 per cent.
A 2.6 per cent reduction on the city's $200 million in subsidies would represent about $5 million in additional pressure, Spearn said.
That alone would not be an insurmountable challenge, they noted. But on top of the $96 million existing gap, Canada's largest housing provider faces a very real question of how to adequately take care of their 110,000 tenants.
“The 2.6 per cent just makes it a $101 million problem. That's really what we have to confront,” Spearn said.
Tory's spokesperson Amanda Galbraith said in a statement that the mayor “has placed a huge priority on the need to repair and fund Toronto Community Housing,” including $250 million in 2016 for capital repair projects.
“But we can't go it alone. Funding for housing is a shared responsibility, and the federal and provincial governments need to step up.”
They said the city will be “working closely with TCH to find reductions that don't affect tenants.”
Spearn promised they would start the budget from scratch for 2017, building it up from zero to question every needed expense. They will attempt more debt restructuring to raise another $200 million for capital repairs next year.
Some 30,000 repairs have been completed already as part of the corporation's 10-year, $2.6 billion plan that anticipated funding from all three levels of government. But so far, only the city has contributed with just a quarter of the needed repairs — including on roofs, elevators and furnaces — completed.
“We're making headway,” said Spearn. “With what we know today, we cannot continue the repair program in 2017 in the levels we've had at the past because we're going to run out of money.”
Housing advocate and TCH board member Councillor Ana Bailao said TCH's budget trouble is much bigger than the 2.6 per cent request.
They questioned why funding from other levels of government has been slow to arrive and disproportionate to the city's need — with more than half of the waitlist for affordable housing in the province centered in Toronto and TCHC housing more low-income residents than any other corporation in the country.
“These are the questions I want to start getting answers for and that we've been asking,” they said.
Though Tory's taskforce earlier tabled long-term ideas to make TCH more sustainable, in the short-term Councillor Joe Cressy, who also sits on the TCH board, said the current budget direction is effecting tenants now.
“It is painfully obvious to anyone who's paying attention or who's looked at the books that a decrease rather than an increase in funding for TCHC means residents of TCHC will live less quality lives,” they said. “There are no pencils to save. The impact will be felt by residents.”
Though Tory and their council allies have argued looking for the 2.6 in reductions is a necessary exercise, Cressy called it “political showmanship.”
“The only reason the mayor is proposing this 2.6 per cent is to look like he's fiscally responsible before we have the revenue tools debate,” Cressy said of a pending discussion this fall on whether to impose new taxes and fees to increase funding for city needs.
In preliminary budget submissions, Spearn has told the council that to find $5 million, they would need to mostly reverse the extra $5.4 million investment approved by council as part of Tory's taskforce — money that would have been used, for example, to hire frontline staff to manage extreme hoarding situations.
“We can just simply say to council, ‘thank you very much, you can have the money back,' ” Spearn said. “Which means the tenant experience slips backwards again and then we said: ‘Oh, by the way, we still have this $96 million hole in the budget.'”
Asked simply by Councillor Gord Perks at budget committee in June whether TCH could maintain its duty to be a good landlord and make the cuts, Spearn's answer was simple: “No.”
“This is the thing about using a blunt instrument,” Perks told the Star about Tory's across-the-board 2.6 per cent request. “It shows a complete lack of understanding on how each budget works.”
In the Firgrove Cres. community, where a growing fissure in the concrete floor on the third level of a townhome complexes gives residents an unwelcome view of the second floor and where crews have scraped muddy concrete over the brick faces of the buildings just to hold them together, Penny said residents aren't asking for much — just a decent place to live. They deserve that, they said.
“When we have certainty in funding then we'll work with the community on what is the best strategy to rebuild this community,” they said. “They're ready for this. We just have to find the money.”

[Despite its spectacular giant nickel, Suddbury, Ont. is top of the list. / The Canadian Press]
Sudbury, the hub of Ontario's mining sector, continues to have the worst labour market of Canada's 33 largest cities, according to this month's edition of BMO's Labour Market Report Card.
The city, founded on the back of Canada's booming nickel ore industry, has since become a poster child for the struggling commodities market with its population only growing 0.2 per cent and employment falling 7 per cent versus last February's numbers. The city stood at 33 on the list with unemployment at 8.4 per cent, nearly a point and a half higher than the national 7.2 per cent unemployment rate.
“Cities have to achieve a certain critical size before they can rely on their own internal circular economy to take hold,” says Rafael Gomez, director of the Centre for Industrial Relations and Human Resources at the University of Toronto. “If single industry doesn't lead to other spin offs and grow a city size beyond a level of several hundreds of thousands of people then when the one or two industries close you're trapped because those industries were essentially creating the viability of every other service sector job there.”
While the Greater Sudbury Area's economy has grown to include other services like retail and healthcare, roughly 36 per cent of those employed in Ontario's mining sector calls the region home. Nickel, a key ingredient in steel, was the worst performing commodity in 2015 losing nearly 42 per cent of its value.
Gomez points to other resource-driven economic centres – like Saint John, N.B. in 30th place and unemployment at 8.3 per cent; Thunder Bay, Ont., in 29th and 6.5 per cent unemployment; Saquenay, Que., in 28th with unemployment rates at 7.6 per cent; and St. John's, N.L. in 25th with unemployment at 6.7 per cent – which despite efforts to diversify their economies still suffer from their long-running ties to a single industry.
“St. John's was doing pretty well when oil was high and the offshore oil industry was creating a lot of spin off jobs in the mainland,” they say. “Now labour market prospects for people are much reduced.”
Ontario has seen a resurgence with the weakening of the Canadian dollar, adding 19,800 jobs in January, boosting employment growth to 1.5 per cent. But despite the rosy outlook for the province's manufacturing sector, Windsor, which landed near the bottom on BMO's report card at 31st, continues to carry the countries the highest unemployment at 9.3 per cent. Youth is the hardest hit by the embattled economy there, with unemployment amongst that demographic hitting a staggering 22 per cent in January, according to StatsCan.
Kelowna, B.C. and both Peterborough and St. Catherines in Ontario also made the bottom ten at 32, 27 and 26 respectively, albeit not because of ties to resources or manufacturing.
“They benefit from high housing prices in places like Vancouver and Toronto becoming viable commuter cities,” explains Gomez. “So that creates spin off growth and opportunities in those centres especially from ancillary.”
Their ties to certain major cities reverberates out, causing employment to come and go in bursts as the cities add new services like big box retailers or personal services.

During the Cowboys' Sunday Night Football game against the Giants, one of Dak Prescott's pre-snap audibles was “Shanahan.”
It audibled the Cowboys into a zone running play.
The significance of the audible being Shanahan, of course, is in reference to Super Bowl LI. In case you've been living under a rock, the Falcons blew a 28-3 lead to the Patriots, after being up late in the third quarter.
The Falcons didn't run the ball as much as they should have, hence the audible being called Shanahan.
There's not many other code words you could use for the audible for the rest of the offense to easily remember what the audible is. But that one's also obvious enough to where some of the Giants could guess. Because well, the Falcons should have run the damn ball.
The Smiley Company is a brand licensing company that holds the rights to smiley face symbols in over 100 countries (notably not including the United States).[2][3][4] The company is considered[by whom?] one of the top 100 licensing companies in the world[5] and creates products including textiles, puzzles, party goods, stationery, automobile accessories, and toys for licensed brand partners and retailers.[6][7]
History [ edit ]
The company's signature smiley, which closely resembles the iconic smiley face created by U.S. graphic artist Harvey Ross Ball in 1963,[8][9][10] was created by journalist Franklin Loufrani in 1971 as a way to indicate to readers of the French newspaper France-Soir which stories held good news.[11] Before the campaign started, in October 1971, Loufrani registered their smiley face with the French trademark office.[12] By the 1990s, Franklin and their son Nicolas Loufrani held trademarks for the symbol in around 70 countries and had licensed the smiley to brands including Levi Strauss & Co.[11]
In 1996, the Loufranis founded the Smiley Company in London, England, built around the Smiley brand.[12] In 1997, Nicolas created hundreds of emoticons, including a 3D smiley logo.[13] Some sources incorrectly claim that Nicolas was the first to create portrait-orientation emoticons,[14][need quotation to verify] but various prior usage of portrait-format emoticons dates back to as early as 1972.[15][16][17][18] Their images, registered with the United States Copyright Office in 1997, were first published as GIF files on the internet in 1998, making them the first graphical emoticons used in technology.[19][20] They launched the SmileyWorld brand shortly thereafter.[21][22] In the early 2000s, the company licensed the rights to their emoticons to telecom companies, including Nokia, Motorola, Samsung, amongst others.[23] Nicolas Loufrani compiled their graphical emoticons, along with other existing images used for communication, into an online dictionary[24] which was divided into categories,[25] and by 2002, the dictionary included over 3,000 images.[26]
In 2005, the company announced the creation of the Smiley World Association, later renamed Smiley Fund, as a charitable arm of the company, to which it donates 10 percent of its profits.[27][28]
Dispute with Walmart [ edit ]
In 1997, the Smiley Company filed a trademark application for its smiley with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In 2001, Walmart opposed the registration, citing a likelihood of confusion between the Loufrani smiley and a smiley face Walmart had been using since 1990.[29] The USPTO eventually sided with Walmart and rejected the Smiley Company's application, due to widespread use of smiley face designs. Seeking to prevent Walmart from using any smiley face design, Nicolas Loufrani next sued Walmart in federal court in 2009, while claiming that their smiley face was "readily distinguishable" from Walmart's. The case was closed in 2011 when the two parties agreed to settle out of court. The terms of the settlement were undisclosed, but Walmart continued to use its smiley design intermittently and returned to using it in a major marketing role in 2016.[30]

This is the latest installment of We Are TFC. Every week, we'll sit down with one of the Reds and help you get to know them a little bit better, on and off the field. This week, Devang Desai chats with forward Jordan Hamilton. The TFC Academy graduate scored their first MLS goal last weekend against Orlando. We hope you'll enjoy this series and let us know which TFC players you'd like to see profiled in the future.
Taking a look at your phone – what picture means the most to you and why?
& off to the World Cup ! A photo posted by Jordan Hamilton (@jayhams) on Apr 16, 2013 at 2:22pm PDT
HAMILTON: It was 2-2 and we were playing Jamaica to qualify for the U-17 World Cup. I came on and with my first touch I assisted a goal for the third of the match and then I scored the fourth goal. My brother was in the crowd. We had just lost some family members. It was just a crazy moment for me.
How would people close to you describe you in one word?
HAMILTON: Humble.
Why?
HAMILTON: Just because I'm a kid from Scarborough and I haven't changed much.
What's your favourite pastime?
HAMILTON: Watching television shows. Game of Thrones, Arrow, I'm waiting for Power and How To Get Away With Murder. I also like to play basketball.
What do you think of the latest Game Of Thrones season so far?
HAMILTON: I still have to watch the last episode but it started off pretty boring and got intense in the last couple of weeks.
Who is your favourite basketball player?
HAMILTON: Russell Westbrook because they play with so much fire.
Favourite soccer player and why?
HAMILTON: I have a couple. Gonzalo Higuain and Harry Kane right now.
Who's the funniest player on the team?
HAMILTON: [Long pause] I don't know… no one's really funny. Who did most people say?
Danny Lovitz has been popular
HAMILTON: Yeah, I guess.. Danny Lovitz. Yeah. I don't know, there's no like out and out joker.
Who's lowkey the funniest?
HAMILTON: Probably Danny. Or Josh Williams.
Any quirks or superstitions before a match?
HAMILTON: Up until last year I was really superstitious and then this year I just let my game do the talking. I'll eat the same breakfast but that's about it.
What's the breakfast?
HAMILTON: I'll make oatmeal at home and then I'll walk downstairs to get an avocado, chicken and egg sandwich at Aroma Espresso Bar.
Strangest things you've seen your teammates do before a game?
HAMILTON: I don't know how a couple of guys drink a couple of red bulls before the game
Favourite movie?
HAMILTON: Law Abiding Citizen
Favourite music artist?
HAMILTON: Anyone who knows me or seen me on Instagram knows my captions are Drake lyrics so (laughs) That's an easy one.
How do you kill time during the off-season?
HAMILTON: Honestly, I have never been on vacation before. It's usually with like National team youth camps and stuff but we'll see this year.
Do you have a place in mind that you'd like to go?
HAMILTON: Probably Jamaica because my background is Jamaican, to see all my family.
If you weren't a soccer player, what would you be doing?
HAMILTON: A lot of people always laugh at me for this but I really want to be a lawyer.
Eriq Zavaleta said the same thing
HAMILTON: Yeah. My mom always told me I'm really good at arguing.
Soccer related: You burst on the scene and play against some of the biggest European clubs. Then you battle through adversity after that and here you are now, scoring your first MLS goal against Orlando. How much of that time with TFC 2 and having to fight/prove your way back into consideration help you mature as a player?
HAMILTON: That was some of the most difficult times in my career so far, playing down at TFC 2. Just the mental aspect of things and not scoring all the time. It was hard mentally but it helped me find myself as a player.
Favourite moment with TFC so far?
HAMILTON: I would go all the way to when I first got called into preseason when I was 15 with Aron Winter. So it's been a long time coming for me. Almost 5 years now.
Who are your heroes?
HAMILTON: My brother.
Tell me a little bit about your brother.
HAMILTON: He's six years older than me. They went on full scholarship to the states to Oral Roberts in Oklahoma and now he's an accountant doing their CPA and they work for the NFL.
Are they the reason why you wanted to play soccer?
HAMILTON: It was between basketball, soccer and track and field and I ended up following what my older brother did so I chose soccer. I was also further along in soccer with the national teams and all that because in other sports it starts later.
When I say “Toronto”, what's the first thing that comes to mind?
Home.
That's a good answer. Who is your best friend?
HAMILTON: I actually only have two best friends, one is Brandon John, they play for Seattle Sounders 2 now and the other one is Tamar Robinson, they go to school for basketball in University of New Brunswick. Tamar I grew up playing basketball with since we were eight. Brandon I met when I was 11 at Malvern Soccer Club and left to go play with Ajax. At my first practice we were wearing the same shoes and ever since then we were close.
What is your ultimate goal in life?
To be happy. Happiness is the key to everything so money and everything else will come if you're happy.

In this episode of the Solid Podcast, David Cranor and I talk with Jim Stogdill, one of the key figures behind the launch of our Solid conference, about some of the cool pieces of hardware that we've come across recently.
Stogdill starts off with the Hemingwrite, an ultra-simplified Internet-connected typewriter for writers who need to isolate themselves from distraction. It duplicates, at significant expense and austerity, a small part of any modern computer's functionality. The Hemingwrite's existence — along with that of its oversubscribed Kickstarter campaign — demonstrates the new economics of hardware: development costs have fallen enough that clever entrepreneurs can isolate and solve niche consumer problems like needing a browserless computer because you sometimes don't want to be distracted by your browsered computer. Also, I'd like one.

Disclaimers:
The National Democratic Institute (NDI) said that part of its staff were shifted to Lithuania after Russia expelled US government's aid agency USAID from Moscow.
"Some of our (Russia) staff is in Lithuania temporarily as we sort out our options," said Kathy Gest, a spokesperson for NDI.
Lithuania's Foreign Ministry has noted both of the United States' key political parties – the Republicans and the Democrats – now had their funds in Lithuania.
"We are glad to see increasing presence of US party funds in Lithuania – the National Democratic Institute representing the Democratic political wing of the United States is settling here, in addition to the International Republican Institute that has been operating rather successfully here," the ministry's Information and Public Relations Department told BNS.
"The funds contributed greatly to promoting democratic values of a free legal country and reinforcement of democracy across Europe – from Spain and Portugal to Central Europe and the Baltic states where their support to transformation of the countries and consolidation of party systems was extremely significant," the ministry said.
The diplomats also said NDI would be a nice addition to the European political funds with old traditions of operating in Lithuania, including Germany's Christian and Conservative Konrad Adenauer Foundation and the Social Democratic Fredrich Ebert Foundation.
Earlier this year, Russia ousted the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) from Russia, accusing it of financing pro-democratic projects and thus interfering with Russia's domestic affairs.
With so many other hacking threats out there, you probably don't believe that hackers breaking into Internet-connected sex toys is a big deal. However, this is a serious matter, as cybercriminals are targeting more and more products that are connected to the Internet to steal or temporarily hijack data.
DON'T MISS: DOJ warns that it could force Apple to hand over iOS source code
To prove that everything that's connected to the Internet is susceptible to attacks, Trend Micro spokesperson Udo Schneider surprised journalists at a news conference by turning on a “large, neon-pink vibrator” by “typing out a few lines of code on their laptop,” as Reuters describes it.
“If I hack a vibrator it's just fun,” Trend Micro CTO Raimund Genes told reporters at CeBIT in Hanover. “But if I can get to the back-end, I can blackmail the manufacturer.”
Reuters explains that various German businesses, hospitals and even the government were targeted by hackers in the recent past.
In 2014, a German steel mill suffered “massive damage,” after attackers got into the computer network. Last year, the lower house of parliament in Germany was attacked by hackers, who forced it to shut down the system for a few days.
In recent weeks, German hospitals have been attacked by ransomware, that deadly malware program that encrypts data on computers until a ransom is paid. Such ransomware attacks are getting more and more frequent.
Therefore, the fact that a skilled attacker can turn on a vibrator remotely is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to online security. Hackers can do a lot more damage than that once they figure a way inside a target's computer. Incidentally, that's why strong security and unhackable encryption are must-have features in today's devices.
Reuters goes on to say that 51% of companies in Germany have been victims of digital espionage, data theft or sabotage in the past two years, with the number going up to two-thirds for small-to-medium-sized manufacturers.
Well, Pierre, you got fleeced. No two ways about it. Alex Burrows is no longer an NHL-level talent. They once put up 67 points when playing with both Sedin twins, but at this point he's a 25-point guy. That's Tom Pyatt territory. Only Pyatt's five years younger. Jonathan Dahlen is having a historic season in the Allsvenskan. He's 19. Already in a redraft of 2016, he'd move into the first round. Obviously no prospect is a sure thing, but Burrows is a pretty sure candidate for retirement at this point.
On the whole Derick Brassard/Mika Zibanejad thing, we understood you. Z-bad was a young centre about to go RFA. They were going to be too expensive. Trading them opened up room for the Mike Hoffman extension that happened and the Mark Stone extension to be. We recognize that your handcuffing contracts, Bobby Ryan and Dion Phaneuf, were not through your own doing. You've done pretty well so far this year, getting Mike Condon for next-to-nothing and Tommy Wingels for possibly less than nothing.
But this trade makes no sense. You're selling what could've been a big part of the future to get a player who might even get scratched down the stretch this year. Tell me what Burrows brings that someone like Mike Blunden or Phil Varone doesn't. This trade doesn't help now, and makes the future a lot worse.
Conservation groups and other advocates are lobbying against a proposed oil and gas lease area that would be located in the Dry Creek proposed wiliderness area just outside of Zion National Park. (Photo: Luke Henry/Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance)
Conservation groups are rallying supporters to fight a proposed oil and gas lease sale on public lands that could come within just two miles of Zion National Park.
The Bureau of Land Management released this week an environmental assessment of three parcels nominated as potential leasing sites within Washington County, including two that would be well within view of the popular park if they're actually developed.
“This is a completely inappropriate location for oil and gas leasing and development,” said Steve Masefield, a resident in the nearby town of Virgin and a former chairperson of the Virgin Planning and Zoning Commission. “Drilling on these leases would not only degrade the scenic vistas enjoyed by visitors driving to Zion — nearby rural neighborhoods would be devastated by industrial smells, lighting and traffic. Our water — and the water used by communities downstream — could be polluted.”
The two parcels in question straddle the North Creek drainage area just west of the national park boundaries, north of Virgin and other tourism-heavy towns along state Route 9. A third parcel is also under consideration about 10 miles to the northwest, along Interstate 15 just north of the Toquerville interchange. Combined, they cover 4,730 acres of land administered by the BLM's St. George Field Office.
The BLM is taking public comment on the EA until Feb. 10. If approved, the parcels could be included in the agency's oil and gas lease sale currently scheduled for June 12.
The two parcels closest to Zion have been listed as available for lease on the agency's resource management plan and have been the subject of multiple requests for nomination for several years, according to a BLM spokesperson.
The BLM decided this time to initiate the leasing process to determine whether leases could be possible and to determine if stipulations could be sufficient to protect resources on the land, said Ryan Sutherland, a public affairs specialist with the agency.
Sutherland said in an email that if the agency decides against a sale, the parcels would be deferred until the resource management plan could be amended.
"We have notified and tried to work with the (National Park Service) throughout this process, and will continue to do so," they said.
Any private party can nominate BLM land for leasing, but agency representatives said nomination only initiates a lengthy environmental process. If any or all of the proposed parcels are included in the sale, each would still require an additional site-specific environmental study before operations could begin.
The EA cites potential challenges to drilling including air quality, recreational activity and the presence of nearby endangered or protected animal and plant species.
According to the assessment, oil production in the area could provide “short-term opportunities for employment” and other benefits, with the average cost to drill and complete an individual well currently estimated at $5 million. Longer-term benefits could be measured if the well is productive.
The EA also notes that negative economic impacts are possible, including potential impacts on tourism. More than 4 million people visited Zion in 2016, and the park is by far the largest driver of the county's tourism industry.
Opponents were questioning whether leases should be considered at all within such close proximity to the park, with conservationists noting the proposed parcels overlap lands the BLM designates as possessing wilderness characteristics.
“With over 4 million annual visitors to (Zion), BLM should be working collaboratively with the National Park Service to protect — not threaten — the world class resource these visitors come to enjoy and be inspired by,” said Cory MacNulty with the National Parks Conservation Association. “The doorstep to one of America's ‘Best Ideas' is not the place for oil and gas leasing and development.”
Decades have passed since the last effort at oil drilling in Washington County, but the area did see a series of drilling efforts in the early 1900s, starting with a well field outside of Virgin in 1907, according to the Washington County Historical Society.

An oil well was also the site of one of the area's worst tragedies.
In 1935, an explosion killed 10 people and injured two others at the site of the Escalante oil well in Bloomington, about five miles south of the St. George city center. About 100 townspeople had gathered to watch a “shooting” at the well, during which explosives were to be used to stimulate better production. An estimated 2,500 pounds of nitroglycerin ignited, setting off an explosion that witnesses said could be felt as far away as Pipe Springs, 60 miles to the east, according to accounts recorded in the book “Images of Faith; a pictorial history of St. George, Utah,” published with photographs by the Lynne Clark Collection.
Electronic copies of the EA are available online at http://on.doi.gov/2fQdXkY . Hard copies can be obtained in person at the BLM's St. George Field Office, 345 E. Riverside Drive.
The public review and comment period is scheduled to last until 4:30 p.m. on Feb. 10.

Following the announcement of the demonetization of 500 and 1000-rupee notes by the Prime Minister of India, I had predicted the distress this would cause for the common man and the nature of political divide it was destined to create in the near future. While any evidence of money recovered shall be noted only in the months to follow, the discussion now must focus on how matters have come to a head with a deadlock in the functioning of the winter session of parliament.The political class now stands divided in two distinct groups, with the government and the opposition averse to the idea of allowing a discussion unless held on specific conditions. In this process, the legislature and its functions have been held hostage by the warring egos of these two groups. Despite the fact that some parties including BJD and JD(U) have attempted to establish dialogue on the floor of the house, a large section of the opposition has expressly, and at times in a volatile fashion, criticized the poor implementation of the demonetization process while at the same time disallowing parliament to function and with no furnishing to the government of constructive solutions to end this plight.It is around the rule under which the discussion on demonetization must be introduced that the Lok Sabha stands divided. The argument over which rule to introduce the discussion under, while seemingly pertinent for sticklers for parliamentary procedures, does not seem entirely fitting in the context of a stalled debate over the suffering of the people and the inherent mismanagement in implementing this policy across the nation. I have submitted for discussion on the matter a notice under Rule 193 of the Lok Sabha Rule of Procedure, calling for a short-duration discussion on the matter. While the Treasury benches of the House are inclined to hold a discussion under Rule 193, which grants only a debate, the opposition continues to push for a discussion under an adjournment motion followed by a vote in the House. This is indicative of a censure of the government's decision through the votes cast against it. It comes as no surprise that the government is vehemently opposed to the introduction of the motion with a vote on the floor of the House. This tug-of-war of sorts between the two camps has led to a stalemate of over ten days now, with little to no discussion on a matter of crucial importance to the people of India.The irony remains that since the House is getting adjourned on a daily basis, the government would have been better off holding a discussion via an adjournment motion in the beginning itself. Given that the numbers in the Lok Sabha dictate that any vote would go in the favour of the government, why the opposition continues to push for an adjournment is beyond logic. The clash of these egos has prevented a meaningful debate in the House, while the country continues to suffer. It appears as if the government is waiting for the situation to better by tweaking the policy every day while the opposition is betting on the government to fail, both at the cost of immense tragedy caused to the citizens who have voted them to office.There is a looming absurdity in the unwillingness of elected representatives to discuss demonetization with an unprecedented stubbornness. While discussions on some major bills remain ignored so far in this session, the political reluctance depicts a disinterest in reconciliation, even in the face of a pressing need to discuss the GST Bill. This shall ultimately draw a compromise between the two distinct sides as noticed in the parliament currently.Principally, the Lok Sabha is required to address the oversight of the Legislature's duties to hold the Executive responsible as well. The deadlock arising from the complete breakdown of communications in the parliament currently is interfering with the duty of the legislature to hold the government answerable for its actions, to question the legality and efficiency of the current demonetization move and to suggest methods that will ease the transition process in a constructive parley of ideas. There is therefore an immense need for introspection on both sides of the political spectrum and a speedy realization of what the duties of elected representatives of people's interests are.(Kalikesh Narayan Singh Deo is a second-time sitting Member of Parliament from Bolangir in Odisha and a prominent leader of the Biju Janata Dal.)

A group associated with cockfighting in Kentucky is promising political retribution against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for their vote in favor of the farm bill last month, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported.
“This will destroy Mitch McConnell in Kentucky,” Craig Davis, president of the United Gamefowl Breeders Association, told the newspaper.
The bill made attending a cockfighting event a federal misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in prison and a $100,000 fine.
Davis, who confronted McConnell with hundreds of other “cockfighting enthusiasts” at a Monday event, said they could move “as many as 60,000 votes” if McConnell doesn't address the issue.
They said that some UGBA members had already proposed putting their support behind McConnell's Republican primary challenger, Matt Bevin, but Davis wanted to give McConnell a chance to right theirs wrong.
“When you make a law like that you take good taxpaying people and you turn them into criminals overnight,” they said. “The grassroots on this are not playing games anymore. They've been beaten and battered for 30 years. They're rural people. They want to be left alone.”
McConnell's office told the newspaper that their staff was willing to hear their grievances.
Russia has long ceased to conceal its participation in the conflict in and de facto occupation of Donbas. On the one hand, the old song is still being sung at the official level about "civil war" or "internal conflict", but it's all quite different with public moves and statements.
One day it's Vladimir Putin saying "we are compelled to protect" the Russian-speaking population in eastern Ukraine, then it's the Russian military authorities blocking access of Ukrainian inspectors to military facilities in Rostov region, from where the weapons and military equipment are supplied to Russian militants, that is, the Russian military disguised as such. This is all being spiced up with hysteria on Russian TV, where State Duma deputies and other officials who could hardly be called decision makers root for the occupied Donbas, calling the captured territories "historically Russian" land. For Russian citizens, the fact of Moscow's control over parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions is anything but a secret, but the dodgiest ones stick to a traditional argument "Donbas is ours! Go try and prove otherwise…"
There is nothing to prove here though. This is what the Russian leadership has successfully been doing anyway. The Russian president publicly speculates over the topic of when the time will come when "Russia takes Donbas" and analyzes the situation in order to "make a timely decision."
In the flow of such statements, there is a point that will make the international community not only look closely at the aggressor state but also consider bringing it to justice.
Recently a documentary by Oliver Stone premiered in the U.S. - a series of interviews with Vladimir Putin. Conversations were recorded at different periods of time, but one of them, dated July 2015, is definitely worth attention. That was one year after the downing of the Malaysian Airlines passenger liner flight MH17.
Stone asks Putin about the MH17 crash. The Russian president traditionally blames the U.S. for all sins possible, claiming Washington doesn't intend to disclose its intelligence data about the deadly attack, since the Kremlin "understands their position in Ukraine."
"All of them wanted to blame the Donbas militia and, indirectly, Russia, which supports the militia," Putin admitted back in 2015. They immediately add that this would not have happened, "had the Ukrainian leadership listened to us and not started full-scale military operations."
Putin doesn't lack logic. Really, Ukrainians ("one people with Russia as Moscow claims") didn't wish to meet with flowers those incoming Russian tanks. They reproach Ukraine that it has been proving with fire and sword (not without some success) to itself and the whole world its right to its own place under the sun.
Who could that be other than the Russian defense ministry who owns the Buk missile launcher, which shot down MH17?
However, a year later, in September 2016, a Joint Investigation Team found that the plane was shot down by a missile shot from a Russian Buk launcher brought to the militant-occupied territory of Donbas from Russia. Investigators do not specify the owner of the deadly Buk. But, no matter how many fairytales for the media are written about "volunteer soldiers on vacation," it is unlikely that it will come to mind of anyone even in Russia to justify the existence of "privately-owned" Russian anti-aircraft missile systems. Who could that be other than the Russian defense ministry who owns the Buk missile launcher, which shot down MH17?
Russian army is led by the supreme commander-in-chief. As Putin themselves said a few years ago, while answering the UNIAN correspondent's question, the Russian president and the supreme commander-in-chief "is one person", who is responsible for the fate of Russian troops.
Moscow understands perfectly that it's ever too close to being driven into the corner by unquestionable evidence. This is what they being getting prepared for.
In fact, the MH17 tragedy has become a mirror of Russian aggression. And while a detailed investigation has been carried out in relation to the deadly Buk launcher and every point of its movement has been registered, it is almost impossible to carry out such a detailed analysis regarding hundreds of tanks and other military equipment deployed from Russia. In any case, the tracks will lead first to the seized parts of Ukrainian-Russian border and then to some specific military unit or a warehouse of the Russian Defense Ministry.
Moscow understands perfectly that it's ever too close to being driven into the corner by unquestionable evidence. This is what they being getting prepared for. It is no accident that Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matvienko, who is the third high-ranking official in the Russian hierarchy, called the initiative to create an International MH17 Tribunal (298 people died!!!) "interference" in Russia's internal affairs.
Russia's massive propaganda machine will continue to deny everything vigorously, while the country's leader will be mocking everyone from behind the Kremlin wall and wave their nuclear club.
The civilized world will have to make great effort to bring to justice those responsible for this act of terror.
It is useless to fight terrorism alongside a terrorist.
Roman Tsymbaliuk, Moscow
In a recent report from the academic journal Perspectives on Politics, the United States is not a democracy, but is instead, an oligarchy. For those who aren't up with fancy words, this means that the US government is very, very corrupt.
The study's opening question is quite an eye-opener in itself, where it asks: "Who governs? Who really rules?" in the United States. The answer: "Despite the seemingly strong empirical support in previous studies for theories of majoritarian democracy, our analyses suggest that majorities of the American public actually have little influence over the policies our government adopts. Americans do enjoy many features central to democratic governance, such as regular elections, freedom of speech and association, and a widespread (if still contested) franchise".
They continue: "But... America's claims to being a democratic society are seriously threatened". The findings in the report shows that there is instead "the nearly total failure of 'median voter' and other Majoritarian Electoral Democracy theories [of America]. When the preferences of economic elites and the stands of organized interest groups are controlled for, the preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy".
It does get worse, with the authors of the study with the title of "Testing Theories of American Politics". The authors even state that they are probably under-representing the actual extend of control that the super-rich has over the US. They said: "Economic Elite Domination theories do rather well in our analysis, even though our findings probably understate the political influence of elites. Our measure of the preferences of wealthy or elite Americans - though useful, and the best we could generate for a large set of policy cases - is probably less consistent with the relevant preferences than are our measures of the views of ordinary citizens or the alignments of engaged interest groups. Yet we found substantial estimated effects even when using this imperfect measure. The real-world impact of elites upon public policy may be still greater".
What makes this report incredibly important, and bold, is that it is the first of its kind. The first-ever scientific study on whether the United States is a democracy. The paper says: "Until recently it has not been possible to test these contrasting theoretical predictions [that U.S. policymaking operates as a democracy, versus as an oligarchy, versus as some mixture of the two] against each other within a single statistical model. This paper reports on an effort to do so, using a unique data set that includes measures of the key variables for 1,779 policy issues".
The study concludes that the United States is absolutely not a democracy, and instead, is an oligarchy.
According to the latest EQAO report, half of Ontario Grade 6 students don't meet the curriculum standard in math. That's a problem. But it's not the only one. What worries me is that only 13 per cent of students who didn't meet the provincial standard when they were in Grade 3 manage to catch up so they meet the standard for Grade 6. That's the lowest number on that indicator in five years.
Discovery math, to the extent it means anything, is an attempt to apply in a formal setting the insights about numbers that good mathematicians use routinely, writes Paul Wells.
If you fall behind in math you stay behind. That's why it's important to get it right, not just at some vague moment in the future, but for kids who are in Ontario schools right now. Fortunately, every parent in Ontario is sure they know how to teach math. Many parents want to get rid of “discovery math,” broadly defined as “doing it weird.” If only that loopy Liberal government would teach math the way we learned it when we were kids, the theory goes, there'd be no problem. Sure, great, except for one thing. Very few parents I've met can perform more than the most rudimentary arithmetic for themselves. If you all learned math so well, why do you inch toward Junior's algebra homework with a cross and a bulb of garlic?

Discovery math, to the extent it means anything, is an attempt to apply in a formal setting the insights about numbers that good mathematicians use routinely. People who are comfortable with numbers use all sorts of strategies to work with them. Confidently, through a kind of learned intuition. So subtracting 272 from 836 is an altogether different proposition from subtracting 998 from 1,002. In the first case, you're likelier to write it all out, solve the ones column first, carry 100 to the 10s column so you're subtracting seven from 13, and so on. In the second case, I'd count up four from the lower number to the higher. It's a really big drag on a kid to make them do the second problems the same way as the first. And parents who read “add to subtract” on a homework sheet, chuckle and roll their eyes, are committing malpractice. This summer I made my stepson spend some time on Khan Academy, an educational website, to brush up their math before they enter Grade 8. They were briefly baffled by questions that asked, say, 6 1/4 – 3 3/4. One way to do it is to convert both sides to improper fractions. But it's easier if you simply recognize that 6 1/4 is the same as 5 5/4. You can do the differences in your head in about two seconds. The question is, how do you produce the kind of students who will make that insightful leap? All I know for sure is that you don't do it by teaching a bunch of rules students will learn by rote — the beloved “old-fashioned way.” That may work for basic math facts. I did make our son practice their basic addition, subtraction and times tables one summer until they knew them from memory. I wish schools would take more time to nail those basic facts down. Since our school wouldn't take the time, I did. But very quickly, math becomes so complex you can't have a rule for everything. Khan Academy teaches and tests 111 different skills at the fifth-grade level alone. You'd go crazy learning a rule for each skill. You must be able to intuit a useful method for each situation.
Modern curricula recognize, and try to teach, that flexibility. I refuse to say that's a mistake. There is even empirical evidence it's not. A March report from PISA, the international testing organization, found that in countries where students say they rely heavily on memorization, they scored starkly lower on complex advanced math questions than students who memorize less. “To perform at the very top,” the report concludes, students must learn to do math “in a more reflective, ambitious and creative way.” What's to be done about those declining EQAO scores? First, Ontario should support teachers by sharing best teaching practices more widely. In some countries, like Japan, teachers spend far more time mentoring younger newcomers to the profession, and sharing techniques among colleagues. Ontario schools should follow suit.
Article Continued Below
Second, support students by giving them more practice time. The only way to learn how numbers work together is by tackling incrementally more difficult questions, lots of them, over time. Kids need to practice insight just as their parents practiced times tables. If they do, they may just grow up knowing how to do math, not just how to complain about math teachers.

Image caption Easyjet will offer 70 flights a week from Southend Airport
From next spring, one of Europe's largest airlines will be flying from a small airport in south-east England. The BBC's Susannah Cullinane went to London Southend Airport in Essex to find out more about the deal.
There are very few people on the 08:32 train from Liverpool Street to London Southend Airport's new £12m rail terminal.
A quick glance at the neighbouring Stansted Express shows it to be comparatively overflowing - or at least carrying more people per carriage than the one person in mine.
But from next April, Southend Airport - a 50-minute train journey from Liverpool Street compared with Stansted's 46 minutes - will be the departure point for 70 Easyjet flights a week.
The Stobart Group, which owns the airport, aims to have two million passengers a year passing through its terminal by 2020.
Aer Arann and Flybe already operate from Southend, offering flights to the Republic of Ireland and Jersey, but Easyjet will massively extend the airport's reach.
The airline has announced it will fly from Southend to Alicante, Barcelona, Ibiza, Malaga and Majorca in Spain, as well as Belfast, Amsterdam and Faro in Portugal.
The deal means Southend will be the sixth airport serving south-east England to offer flights to mainland Europe, alongside Stansted, Heathrow, Gatwick, London City and Luton airports.
Arriving at Southend Airport railway station the expansion work is immediately obvious.
A £3m control tower opened on 18 July stands opposite, near a new terminal building due to be completed by autumn. A few hundred metres away, the airport's current terminal is flying an orange Easyjet flag.
'No hustle and bustle'

Inside, however, the impression is blacker coffee and full English breakfast than international transport hub.
About 15 people are scattered at wooden tables, apparently unworried by pressing travel concerns, lingering instead over the day's newspapers and chatting amongst themselves.
Cafe Stobart supervisor Jill Ross explains that the relaxed mood is probably because 85% of their customers are locals rather than travellers.
"That's why it's so friendly - they're sort of friends rather than customers."
But Ms Ross says there have been a lot of changes at Southend Airport since they started working in the coffee shop four years ago.
Since Aer Arann began flying out of Southend this March, they say, cafe staff numbers have doubled.
"Everyone is for the expansion," Ms Ross said. "Everyone's said 'how brilliant that they're going to fly here'."
Smoking a cigarette beneath the orange flag outside is Ann Duffy, who says they flew into Southend from their home in Waterford, Ireland, to visit their son and their family.

 They are pleased at news that the airport is to be expanded. "It's good to give some money back to this area. Keep it close to home," they said.
Waiting for a fare at the airport, taxi driver Jim Nolan says they expect the expansion will bring work and jobs to the area.
"It's long overdue that this airport is being developed. It should've happened years ago."
Judicial review
Not all Southend's residents are as supportive of the expansion however.
I think it's long overdue that this airport is being developed. I think it should've happened years ago. Jim Nolan, Resident
Stop Airport Extension Now (SAEN) was formed in opposition to the extension of Southend's runway. SAEN says the 300m extension will lead to a "massive" increase in flights and impact on the lives of people living, working or going to school near the flight path.
Spokesman Denis Walker says Easyjet will not be able to land fully laden Airbus 319 planes at Southend until the airport's runway has been lengthened.
SAEN had been trying to get a judicial review of Southend Council's decision to approve planning permission for the extension, but on Wednesday its appeal was refused.
Mr Walker says the secretary of state must approve the closure of a road at the end of the current runway and a public inquiry into the closure of some public footpath - due to start in November - also needs to be completed before work on the extension can begin.
"We're very concerned about the effect the expansion will have, particularly because it's so close to housing on the south-west side," they said.
Southend's head of business development, Jonathan Rayner, says time has become an important commodity for air travellers and the airport hopes to attract passengers through the relative accessibility of its services.
The airport says it will ensure it takes no more than four minutes to go through its security area while passengers travelling without check-in luggage can expect to be on the arrivals platform within 15 minutes of their plane's doors opening, they say.
A spokesperson for Stansted says the airport is disappointed Easyjet is transferring some of its operations to Southend. But they say the airports are so different it is impossible to directly compare them.
"The decision clearly reinforces just how competitive the airports market is for point-to-point passengers, especially if the UK's largest airline is prepared to start-up at one of the UK's smallest airports."
Image caption Southend Airport has opened a £3m control tower and £12m railway station
Gatwick Airport says Easyjet's decision to fly from Southend "shows that competition is working". It says 15 million people live within an hour's drive of Gatwick.
"Some of those people will have the choice to fly from either Gatwick Airport or a smaller airport like Southend."
London City Airport says "London has a chronic long term shortage of airport capacity" and it recognises attempts will be made to bring "peripheral destinations" in the area market.
Luton Airport says it is too early to tell what the impact of Southend's expansion on its own operations will be.
Peter Morris, chief economist for aviation consultancy Ascend, says the actual level of demand for Easyjet's flights from Southend will only become clear once they're up and running.
With six airports servicing the area around Greater London, and in the face of a weak economy and high fuel costs, Southend's expansion is more likely to redistribute existing aviation traffic than to create a new market, they say.
"Whether the market has got a critical saturation - that's something that only gets validated when people try it and see if it works," they say.
Draft motion seeks to serve as solution to Google's dominance of search markets in Europe and is seen as drastic escalation of running antitrust case
The European parliament is reportedly poised to call for a break-up of Google in a drastic escalation of Europe's long-running antitrust case against the tech giant.
A draft motion seen by the Financial Times, and expected to be agreed next week, calls for the “unbundling [of] search engines from other commercial services” as a potential solution to Google's dominance of the search market in Europe.
The European Commission has been investigating concerns that Google has abused its dominant position in search since 2010 and the dispute has become increasingly bitter. In September the EU's incoming digital commissioner Günther Oettinger warned that any settlement with Google could “cement its strength in the market rather than diluting it”.
German, French and Spanish politicians have attacked the company over a variety of issues including revelations from National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden and “right to be forgotten” legislation that allows people to delete information from search results.
Joaquín Almunia, then the EU's competition commissioner, rejected Google's third attempt to settle the antitrust case in September after political support for the deal collapsed. They reopened the inquiry after “very, very negative” comments from complainants.
Their successor, Margrethe Vestager, has told the European Parliament they will “need some time to decide on the next steps” in the case.
Sigmar Gabriel, Germany's economy minister and vice-chancellor, suggested a break-up of the company in May but suggested regulation was a better move. “We must give serious thought to the possibility of ‘unbundling' the internet market, in a similar way to the electricity and gas networks,” Gabriel wrote in an op-ed published in German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
The case against Google is being backed by rival Microsoft, which faced its own antitrust suits in the 1990s, German publisher Axel Springer and a host of smaller rivals that claim Google is squeezing them out of the market.
“We are afraid of Google,” Mathias Döpfner, chief executive of Axel Springer wrote in an open letter to Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairperson. “I must state this very clearly and frankly, because few of my colleagues dare do so publicly.” They pointed out that Google a 91.2% share of the search-engine market in Germany. They called for restrictions on the company and warned Schmidt the company could “win yourself to death”.
Oettinger has already made suggested remedies for Google's alleged dominance including mandated changes to search results. A public call for a break-up would be the most far-reaching action proposed to date. But the European parliament lacks the authority to force a break-up of a company and any such proposal would meet stiff opposition from Google and the US.
Google was not immediately available for comment.
Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos is set to deliver a major speech at the University of Houston on Monday, entitled “How to Destroy the alt-right.”
The speech is expected to be one of their most substantial addresses to an American university so far, and will include references to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's speech on the alt-right, in which they read out two of Milo's headlines in horrified tones.
The speech will cover where the alt-right came from, what it is, and how the Left can destroy it – assuming it's not already too late.  They are expected to lay the blame for the rise of the movement, as well as the popularity of Donald Trump and himself, at the feet of progressive activists, the left-wing media, liberal college professors, Hollywood, and out-of-control political correctness.
Milo, who has spoken extensively about the alt-right over the past few months, co-authored a guide to the movement in March entitled “An Establishment Conservative's Guide to the alt-right” with Allum Bokhari, which was covered by news outlets all over the world, including the Washington Post, the Boston Globe, BBC News, and the Daily Mail.
They do not describe themselves as a member of the alt-right, but the press has been desperate to crown them a figurehead, as they explained to CNBC recently.
Explaining their decision on the theme of the speech, Milo said “The alt right has been attacked as racist, sexist, transphobic, Islamophobic and homophobic by journalists who show no interest in understanding something they helped to create”.
Milo's event at the University of Houston will be their second date in the recently continued Dangerous Faggot tour, which started its second leg at Texas Tech on Monday.
In Milo's new tour bus, which is emblazoned with their logo, the name of the tour, and of course — five pictures of their face, they are currently travelling across the east and west coasts, stopping at a wide range of schools including Yale, Vanderbilt, and Stanford until the tour's finale in February.
You can see the current dates on the Dangerous Faggot tour at Milo's website here.

NORMAN — The University of Oklahoma Athletics Department announced Wednesday that it has reached an agreement with the University of Nebraska to play an additional two games in the schools' upcoming football series.
The Sooners and Cornhuskers, who were already scheduled to renew their rivalry in Norman on Sept. 18, 2021, and play in Lincoln on Sept. 17, 2022, will now also meet in the 2029 and 2030 seasons, it was revealed by OU athletics director Joe Castiglione and Nebraska athletics director Shawn Eichorst. The 2029 contest will take place Sept. 15 in Norman and the 2030 contest will be played Sept. 14 in Lincoln.
Longtime intraconference rivals, OU holds a 45-38-3 all-time lead against Nebraska in a series that was played annually from 1928 to 1997. The programs haven't met since the 2010 Big 12 Championship Game, a 23-20 Sooners win on Dec. 4 in Arlington, Texas.
OU ranks No. 1 in all-time scoring average (27.50 points per game) while Nebraska ranks No. 3 (25.26).
"Oklahoma and Nebraska are two of the most iconic programs in college football history," said Castiglione, "and we were excited a few years ago when we were able to rekindle the storied series by scheduling games for 2021 and 2022. We feel the same way with the addition of the games in 2029 and 2030. Fans of both programs are extremely passionate and loyal, and we're happy we can preserve — and extend — the on-field history of two of the game's all-time greats."
The most storied game in this historic series is the fabled 1971 "Game of the Century" in Norman that featured No. 2 Oklahoma and No. 1 Nebraska as the Cornhuskers prevailed by a 35-31 count. The game in 2021 will commemorate the 50th anniversary of that classic OU-Nebraska contest.

The two teams also entered their 1987 contest ranked atop the AP poll, as Barry Switzer's No. 2 Sooners captured a 17-7 win over Tom Osborne's No. 1 Cornhuskers in Lincoln. In 2000, an OU team ranked No. 2 in the BCS standings under head coach Bob Stoops posted a 31-14 home win over No. 1 Nebraska (coached by Frank Solich) and eventually won the national title with a 13-0 record.
Oklahoma has won six of its eight last meetings with Nebraska under Stoops. The Sooners also prevailed by a 21-7 margin in the 2006 Big 12 Championship Game played at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City.
Nebraska is the latest marquee opponent added to Oklahoma's non-conference schedule in the upcoming seasons. The Cornhuskers join Houston (2016, 2019), Ohio State (2016, 2017), UCLA (2018, 2019), Army (2018, 2020), Michigan (2025, 2026) and LSU (dates TBA) among OU's future non-conference opponents.
During Stoops' tenure with the Sooners, Oklahoma has faced some of the top programs in college football during the regular season. That list includes Notre Dame (1999, 2012, 2013), Alabama (2002, 2003), Oregon (2004, 2006), UCLA (2005), Washington (2006, 2008), Miami (2007), Florida State (2010, 2011) and Tennessee (2014, 2015).
The Tory MP Ed Vaizey is hurt, bitter and possibly a little bit hungry. At least that's the impression they gave attendees of a “Brexit Briefing” Media Summits event in London last week.
Appearing on-stage to discuss the impact of the UK's departure from the EU on the media sector, Vaizey, who was relieved of their role as minister of state for digital by Theresa May last summer, took the opportunity to let everyone in on a few home truths.
"None of us expected to lose the referendum," Vaizey told the host, Sky News presenter Sam Naz. "Nobody planned what would happen in the aftermath."
Asked if this was an oversight, Vaizey responded: "I think 'was that an oversight' could go down in history as a sort of summary of the Cameron government. I think the way you put it is very good. We sort of stuffed the country up by accident."
At the start of 2016, Vaizey seemed poised for greatness. A barrister and former party staffer, they won the constituency of Wantage in 2005 and was appointed a shadow minister the following year. They became a familiar figure in Culture, Media and Sport, before becoming a minister for Culture and the Digital Economy in 2014. When the EU referendum campaign began, they toured the TV studios defending the Prime Minister's Remain stance. Then came Brexit.
Vaizey is not one of The Telegraph's Tory "mutineers", but nevertheless they remain a harsh critic of the way Brexit is being carried out, to the extent Politico named them as a top "Brexit troublemaker". The invocation of Article 50 may be seen as a "premature act", the backbencher suggested. The timetable this sets out is "slightly artificial", and as a country "we are in a very difficult position".
"I can speak freely, because I'm not part of it," they added in reference to the ongoing Brexit negotiations. "I'm not in the government."
"How are those negotiations going?" probed Naz.
"I have no idea."
"Don't you guys talk to each other?"
"I don't talk to the government," claimed Vaizey.
"Not at all?"
"No."
"Why not?"
"I suppose I'm hurt, bitter, thoroughly pissed off to have been fired by the Prime Minister. Lots of reasons really – typical man behaviour. Sulking, impractical, inability to cope."
The interview clearly going well, Naz took another line of questioning: "Are you going to be a rebel in the future?"
"I might rebel later on some of the aspects of the EU withdrawal," confirmed Vaizey.
"Keep being as candid as you like," quipped Naz. "They can't sack me," Vaizey replied.
This is not the first time that the MP has been outspoken since their exile from front-bench politics.
Following Theresa May's ill-fated speech at the Conservative party conference last month, Vaizey told BBC Oxford they thought "quite a few people who will now be pretty firmly of the view that they should resign".
Asked what potential benefits Brexit might bring to the media industry they mentioned that deals with the US that will remain unaffected. "Brexit is going to be painful and tortuous and opaque," they offered, "but you don't [just] get rid of X years of British success in creativity."
A former Department of State official confessed Monday that the reason no one in the Obama administration referred to certain acts of terror as “radical Islam” is because they were scared of alienating Muslim allies.
In an op-ed written for The New York Times, Richard Stengel, who previously served as under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs, said there was a very clear reason no one could–or did–label various acts of terror as the product of “radical Islam” and instead used the much less loaded term “violent extremism.”
For Stengel, the reason the Obama administration shied away from the term “radical Islam” was not because it was “too timid or too politically correct,” despite harsh criticisms from Republicans and especially President Donald Trump.
Rather, it was because the Obama administration was concerned the term would alienate Muslim allies in the Middle East.
“To defeat radical Islamic extremism, we needed our Islamic allies–the Jordanians, the Emiratis, the Egyptians, the Saudis–and they believed that term unfairly vilified a whole religion,” Stengel wrote.
“They also told us that they did not consider the Islamic State to be Islamic, and its grotesque violence against Muslims proved it,” they added.
Stengel argued that since the Trump administration seems dead-set on using “radical Islam” to describe the Islamic State and other groups, we should at least let Muslim allies know that it refers only to an extremely small subset of Muslims, so as not to offend our allies.
But still, Stengel still has serious misgivings, as they think it is “not up to us to say what is Islamic and what is not,” and attempting to do so may very well boost recruiting efforts by these terror groups.
During the 2016 presidential election cycle, then-President Barack Obama claimed that groups like ISIS and al-Qaida had deceptively cloaked themselves in Islamic theology to justify acts of barbarism. And although as Stengel noted, the administration has tried to avoid saying what is Islamic and what isn't, Obama firmly stated that “there's no religious rationale that would justify in any way any of the things that they do.”

The Interest Groups Behind Five New Congressional Power Brokers

January 10, 2017 -- With the 115th Congress officially in session, five key committees have new leaders. Committee chairs wield considerable influence over policymaking, not only by helping to draft and revise legislation, but also by deciding which bills receive a hearing. Below is a MapLight analysis of campaign contributions to the five new committee chairs by industry and by company, including corporate PACs and employees of those firms.
Mike Crapo (R-ID)
Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs
The committee has jurisdiction over insurance, financial markets, securities, banking, economic policy, mass transit, housing, and other areas related to financial regulation and urban development.
John Barrasso (R-WY)
Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works
The committee oversees all legislation concerning infrastructure, environmental regulation and conservation.
Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ)
House Committee on Appropriations
The committee is responsible for deciding how the U.S. government spends taxpayer dollars. It is one of the most powerful committees in Congress, guiding the creation of the nation's nearly $4 trillion annual budget.
Virginia Foxx (R-NC)
House Committee on Education and the Workforce
The committee oversees policies related to students and workers, including regulations regarding overtime and the minimum wage, higher education, and charter schools.
Greg Walden (R-OR)
House Energy and Commerce Committee
According to its website, the committee “is vested with the broadest jurisdiction of any congressional authorizing committee,” overseeing telecommunications, food and drug safety, public health research, commerce, and energy policy.
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Benedict on Tuesday linked the Church's opposition to gay marriage to concern about the environment, suggesting that laws undermining “the differences between the sexes” were threats to creation.

The pope made their comments in an address to diplomats in their yearly assessment of world events. The main theme of the address was the environment and the protection of creation.
“To carry our reflection further, we must remember that the problem of the environment is complex; one might compare it to a multifaceted prism,” they said.
“Creatures differ from one another and can be protected, or endangered, in different ways, as we know from daily experience. One such attack comes from laws or proposals which, in the name of fighting discrimination, strike at the biological basis of the difference between the sexes,” they said.
“I am thinking, for example, of certain countries in Europe or North and South America,” they said.
This was a clear reference to legislation either enacted or proposed in several parts of the world.
Last month, Mexico City became the first capital in Catholic Latin America to allow same-sex marriage.
In California, the U.S. state's ban on gay marriage goes to trial on Monday in a federal case that plaintiffs hope to take all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and overturn bans throughout the nation.
Gay marriage is legal is several U.S. states and some European countries.
“Yet freedom cannot be absolute, since man is not God, but the image of God, God's creation. For man, the path to be taken cannot be determined by caprice or willfulness, but must rather correspond to the structure willed by the Creator,” they said.
In their speech to diplomats from more than 170 countries, the pope repeated the themes of their message for the Church's World Day of Peace on January 1, which said industrialized nations must recognize their responsibility for the environmental crisis, shed their consumerism and embrace more sober lifestyles.
CLIMATE CHANGE
They told the diplomats that they were concerned about the failure to reach agreement on climate change at the Copenhagen summit last month.
“I share the growing concern caused by economic and political resistance to combating the degradation of the environment,” they said, adding that they hoped “it will be possible to reach an agreement for effectively dealing with this question” at follow-up conferences in Bonn and Mexico City this year.
“The issue is all the more important in that the very future of some nations is at stake, particularly some island states,” they said.
In other parts of their French-language speech, Benedict repeated calls for “appropriate management” of natural resources, particularly in economically disadvantaged nations.
They said enormous resources were going to military spending “and the cost of maintaining and developing nuclear arsenals” instead of being diverted to help the poor.
Benedict decried what they called “indifference, amounting practically to resignation of public opinion worldwide” of conflicts such as those in Darfur, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
In the film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, narrator Ben Stein poses as a "rebel" willing to stand up to the scientific establishment in defense of freedom and honest, open discussion of controversial ideas like intelligent design (ID). But Expelled has some problems of its own with honest, open presentations of the facts about evolution, ID—and with its own agenda. Here are a few examples—add your own with a comment, and we may add it to another draft of this story. For our complete coverage, see "Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed—Scientific American's Take.
1) Expelled quotes Charles Darwin selectively to connect their ideas to eugenics and the Holocaust.
When the film is building its case that Darwin and the theory of evolution bear some responsibility for the Holocaust, Ben Stein's narration quotes from Darwin's The Descent of Man thusly:
With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated. We civilized men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination. We build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed and the sick. Thus the weak members of civilized societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man. Hardly anyone is so ignorant as to allow their worst animals to breed.
This is how the original passage in The Descent of Man reads (unquoted sections emphasized in italics):
With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated; and those that survive commonly exhibit a vigorous state of health. We civilized men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination. We build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed and the sick; we institute poor-laws; and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment. There is reason to believe that vaccination has preserved thousands, who from a weak constitution would formerly have succumbed to small-pox. Thus the weak members of civilized societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man. It is surprising how soon a want of care, or care wrongly directed, leads to the degeneration of a domestic race; but excepting in the case of man himself, hardly anyone is so ignorant as to allow their worst animals to breed.
The producers of the film did not mention the very next sentences in the book (emphasis added in italics):
The aid which we feel impelled to give to the helpless is mainly an incidental result of the instinct of sympathy, which was originally acquired as part of the social instincts, but subsequently rendered, in the manner previously indicated, more tender and more widely diffused. Nor could we check our sympathy, even at the urging of hard reason, without deterioration in the noblest part of our nature. The surgeon may harden themselves whilst performing an operation, for they know that they are acting for the good of their patient; but if we were intentionally to neglect the weak and helpless, it could only be for a contingent benefit, with an overwhelming present evil.
Darwin explicitly rejected the idea of eliminating the "weak" as dehumanizing and evil. Those words falsify Expelled's argument. The filmmakers had to be aware of the full Darwin passage, but they chose to quote only the sections that suited their purposes.
2) Ben Stein's speech to a crowded auditorium in the film was a setup.
"Viewers of Expelled might think that Ben Stein has been giving speeches on college campuses and at other public venues in support of ID and against "big science." But if they have, the producers did not include one. The speech shown at the beginning and end was staged solely for the sake of the movie. Michael Shermer learned as much by speaking to officials at Pepperdine University, where those scenes were filmed. Only a few of the audience members were students; most were extras brought in by the producers. Judge the ovation Ben Stein receives accordingly.
3) Scientists in the film thought they were being interviewed for a different movie.
As Richard Dawkins, PZ Myers, Eugenie Scott, Michael Shermer and other proponents of evolution appearing in Expelled have publicly remarked, the producers first arranged to interview them for a film that was to be called Crossroads, which was allegedly a documentary on "the intersection of science and religion." They were subsequently surprised to learn that they were appearing in Expelled, which "exposes the widespread persecution of scientists and educators who are pursuing legitimate, opposing scientific views to the reigning orthodoxy," to quote from the film's press kit.
When exactly did Crossroads become Expelled? The producers have said that the shift in the film's title and message occurred after the interviews with the scientists, as the accumulating evidence gradually persuaded them that ID believers were oppressed. Yet as blogger Wesley Elsberry discovered when they searched domain registrations, the producers registered the URL "expelledthemovie.com" on March 1, 2007—more than a month (and in some cases, several months) before the scientists were interviewed. The producers never registered the URL "crossroadsthemovie.com". Those facts raise doubt that Crossroads was still the working title for the movie when the scientists were interviewed.
4) The ID-sympathetic researcher whom the film paints as having lost their job at the Smithsonian Institution was never an employee there.
One section of Expelled relates the case of Richard Sternberg, who was a researcher at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History and editor of the journal Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington. According to the film, after Sternberg approved the publication of a pro-ID paper by Stephen C. Meyer of the Discovery Institute, they lost their editorship, was demoted at the Smithsonian, was moved to a more remote office, and suffered other professional setbacks. The film mentions a 2006 House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform report prepared for Rep. Mark Souder (R–Ind.), "Intolerance and the Politicization of Science at the Smithsonian," that denounced Sternberg's mistreatment.
This selective retelling of the Sternberg affair omits details that are awkward for the movie's case, however. Sternberg was never an employee of the Smithsonian: their term as a research associate always had a limited duration, and when it ended they were offered a new position as a research collaborator. As editor, Sternberg's decision to "peer-review" and approve Meyer's paper by themselves was highly questionable on several grounds, which was why the scientific society that published the journal later repudiated it. Sternberg had always been planning to step down as the journal's editor—the issue in which they published the paper was already scheduled to be their last.
The report prepared by Rep. Souder, who had previously expressed pro-ID views, was never officially accepted into the Congressional Record. Notwithstanding the report's conclusions, its appendix contains copies of e-mails and other documents in which Sternberg's superiors and others specifically argued against penalizing them for their ID views. (More detailed descriptions of the Sternberg case can be found on Ed Brayton's blog Dispatches from the Culture Wars and on Wikipedia.)
5) Science does not reject religious or "design-based" explanations because of dogmatic atheism.
Expelled frequently repeats that design-based explanations (not to mention religious ones) are "forbidden" by "big science." It never explains why, however. Evolution and the rest of "big science" are just described as having an atheistic preference.
Actually, science avoids design explanations for natural phenomena out of logical necessity. The scientific method involves rigorously observing and experimenting on the material world. It accepts as evidence only what can be measured or otherwise empirically validated (a requirement called methodological naturalism). That requirement prevents scientific theories from becoming untestable and overcomplicated.
By those standards, design-based explanations rapidly lose their rigor without independent scientific proof that validates and defines the nature of the designer. Without it, design-based explanations rapidly become unhelpful and tautological: "This looks like it was designed, so there must be a designer; we know there is a designer because this looks designed."
A major scientific problem with proposed ID explanations for life is that their proponents cannot suggest any good way to disprove them. ID "theories" are so vague that even if specific explanations are disproved, believers can simply search for new signs of design. Consequently, investigators do not generally consider ID to be a productive or useful approach to science.
6) Many evolutionary biologists are religious and many religious people accept evolution.
Expelled includes many clips of scientists such as Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, William Provine and PZ Myers who are also well known as atheists. They talk about how their knowledge of science confirms their convictions and how in some cases science led them to atheism. And indeed, surveys do indicate that atheism is more common among scientists than in the general population.
Nevertheless, the film is wrong to imply that understanding of evolution inevitably or necessarily leads to a rejection of religious belief. Francisco Ayala of the University of California, Irvine, a leading neuroscientist who used to be a Dominican priest, continues to be a devout Catholic, as does the evolutionary biologist Ken Miller of Brown University. Thousands of other biologists across the U.S. who all know evolution to be true are also still religious. Moreover, billions of other people around the world simultaneously accept evolution and keep faith with their religion. The late Pope John Paul II said that evolution was compatible with Roman Catholicism as an explanation for humankind's physical origins.
During Scientific American's post-screening conversation with Expelled associate producer Mark Mathis, we asked them why Ken Miller was not included in the film. Mathis explained that their presence would have "confused" viewers. But the reality is that showing Miller would have invalidated the film's major premise that evolutionary biologists all reject God.
Inside and outside the scientific community, people will no doubt continue to debate rationalism and religion and disagree about who has the better part of that argument. Evidence from evolution will probably remain at most a small part of that conflict, however.

Finding US Lance Corporal Joseph Scott Pemberton's defense “more imaginary than real,” the Court of Appeals (CA) refused to reverse the guilty verdict meted out on them by the Olongapo City Regional Trial Court Branch 74 for the death of transgender Jeffrey “Jennifer” Laude.
Pemberton was meted out a penalty of up to 10 years imprisonment after they were convicted of homicide. They were also ordered to pay P4.3-million for loss of earning capacity, P30,000 exemplary damages, P50,000 each for civil indemnity and moral damages.

The lower court denied Pemberton's motion for reconsideration prompting them to take their case to the Court of Appeals.
READ: Pemberton guilty of homicide in Laude case, sentenced to up to 12 yrs | Pemberton won't go to a regular jail
Pemberton, in their petition for review before the CA said the lower court erred in convicting them despite the testimony of forensic expert Dr. Raquel Fortun that Laude did not die of drowning.
They added that the lower court also ignored the evidence showing that a third person could be responsible for Laude's death.
Pemberton added that the lower court have made a mistake in interpreting their statement when they said they thought they killed Laude as an admission of guilt when in fact their statement is consistent with self-defense as stated under the Revised Penal Code.
The soldier raised the issue of self-defense saying they were molested by Laude. They said they were only defending their dignity and self-respect.
Among the elements of self-defense that Pemberton must prove exist include: (1) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person resorting to self-defense.
In this case, however, the CA Special 16th Division said for an unlawful aggression to exist, there has to be an actual physical assault or at least a threat to inflict real imminent injury.
“Here, Pemberton did not suffer any injury when they allowed Laude to perform oral sex on him,” the CA said in a 48 page decision written by Associate Justice Marlene B. Gonzales-Sison. The CA said the moment Pemberton pushed Laude away, “there was no longer unlawful aggression to justify the killing of Laude.”

On Pemberton's claim that Laude fought like a man, slapped them that made their ear ring, the CA noted that a general physical examination conducted on Pemberton showed no sign of injury on their head and face.
The CA also dismissed that Pemberton that they believed they were in danger because Laude, their friend Barbie knew the clerk at the Celzone motel where they checked in.
“If Laude was in cahoots with Barbie and [the motel clerk], there was no more need for Laude and Barbie to perform oral sex on Pemberton. The moment they entered Room No. 1, Laude and Barbie could have easily robbed Pemberton if that was their intention all along.”
“We thus find Pemberton's defense of an impending grave danger more imaginary than real… In the absence of unlawful aggression, even the privileged mitigating circumstance of incomplete self-defense which Pemberton also invokes cannot be appreciated in their favor… The conviction of Pemberton for homicide is undeniable,” the CA added in its ruling.
The CA also agreed with the lower court in relying on the findings of Dr. Reynaldo Dave that Laude died due to asphyxia by drowning even though they are not a pathologist over the testimony of forensic expert Dr. Raquel Fortun.
The CA noted that Dr. Dave, though not a pathologist has been a medico-legal officer for 16 years and has conducted 6,000 autopsies. The court added that they were also able to examine Laude's body while Fortun's conclusion was based on documents and pictures provided to them
With regard to a third person that could have possibly killed Laude after Pemberton left the motel, the CA said it was “mighty implausible” for Laude to fight the third person after they were left unconscious by Pemberton and grabbed the necklace.
“There is no rhyme or reason why anyone would kill Laude in their supposed unconscious state, if the version of Pemberton is to be believed,” the CA said.
While there are many possibilities as to the owner of the necklace, the CA said Pemberton's camp never brought up the said matter to any of the investigators that handled the case.
The appeals court also affirmed the P4,320,000 awards to Laude's family for their loss of earning capacity.
It also affirmed the P30,000 exemplary damage that Pemberton has to pay Laude's family.
“Pemberton unabashedly plunged Laude's head in the toilet for the puerile reason that Laude pretended to be a woman. To our mind, placing Laude's head inside a toilet shows that Pemberton never thought of Laude as a human being, but as a fecal matter due to their sexual orientation,” the CA said.
The CA, meanwhile increased the P100,000 (P50,000 each ) civil indemnity and moral damages to P150,000 (P75,000 each) because recent jurisprudence showed that the amount imposed should be the latter.
On the other hand, the actual damages of P155,250.00 was affirmed after Laude's family was able to produce receipts of expenses incurred for the autopsy, wake and burial.
The CA further said that Pemberton shall pay 6 percent interest per annum on all civil liability from the finality of the decision until fully paid.
Associate Justices Ramon A. Cruz and Henri Jean Paul B. Inting concurred in the decision. CBB/rga

Is this the defining moment for Putin's 100,000-strong army of angel-faced devotees? The mass Putin youth movement has been struggling to find a purpose, but in the wake of protests against suspected vote rigging in last week's parliamentary elections its time may have come.
Russian state TV totted up the votes in the Rostov region to a total of more than 146%. Even with Russia's patchy electoral history that's an impressive tally. This week thousands of protesters hit the streets of Moscow to vent their anger about the apparent vote rigging in Sunday's parliamentary elections. The heavy-handed police tactics against journalists and opposition activists are nothing new, nor are the jail sentences based on spurious charges, but there has been a new and slightly surreal backdrop to all this: several thousand young people in white anoraks, waving flags, banging drums and chanting "Putin! Russia!" while opposition activists were being hauled into the back of police vans. They vastly outnumbered the protesters on Monday and Tuesday night in Moscow's Triumphal Square, and, according to some reports, resorted to violence and intimidation to break up the rallies.
They are thought to belong to a group called Nashi (Ours). I spent two weeks filming Nashi for an Unreported World film this autumn. The group was set up in 2005 in response to revolutions in neighbouring ex-Soviet countries to protect against young democratic movements taking power; it has grown to 100,000 members. With seemingly limitless funding and Kremlin backing they were untouchable, but with the Russian opposition movement consumed by infighting, Nashi didn't have a decent sparring partner.
The group had almost become an embarrassment with their over-zealous support for the regime and erotic calendars celebrating Putin's birthday. In a time of relative political stability what exactly were they for?
Outside the American embassy we filmed dozens of Nashi members spray-painting "Forward Russia" on the pavement in 6ft letters. When the notoriously brutal Russian police arrived they were instantly surrounded, filmed and forced to show their documents by members of Nashi. It was clear that the scrawny students, with their powerful political protection, were actually in charge.
Choruses of "I want a man like Putin" sung by beautiful young women accompanied our minibus trips out of Moscow. We started to get a sense this was more of a cult than your average political youth movement. Oksana, a 21-year-old blond, told us artlessly: "I worship Putin.  They are a wonderful man, a splendid man, the most worthy politician. I am a fanatic! When they are behind the wheel Russia will be strong. Forward Russia!"
We were invited back to their weekly meeting at Nashi's £20m headquarters in downtown Moscow. The walls were daubed with Putin slogans and 6ft-high murals of their face reminiscent of Soviet-era propaganda. More sinister was the list of potential opposition targets , including young activist, Ilya Yashin, who was this week sentenced to 15 days in prison for their role in the protests. Members also showed us a video of the harassment campaign against opposition leader Boris Nemtsov who the group has clashed with frequently (and who was also detained this week).
Nashi cut their teeth in these skirmishes, and now have a bigger stage on which to exploit their strength.
The members were largely studying in Moscow, but everyone we met grew up in far-flung regions of Russia. Doubtless they were attracted not just by Putin's sex appeal, but by the status and power the organisation could give them, as well as the potential career enhancement in the future – Nashi's founder is now Russia's minister of youth and many of their disciples will follow them into government.
Now the Kremlin's decision to co-opt provincial Russian youth into a mass movement finally looks like paying off. While opposition activists are arrested, beaten and jailed for taking part in protests, the thousands of Nashi members confronting them are seemingly above the law.
But this is no spontaneous show of support. Footage has appeared online of an enormous compound housing thousands of Nashi members who admit to being brought in by bus and by train from as far away as Siberia. There are reports that Nashi members have been given 500 roubles each or even free meals at McDonald's to attend rallies. The Kremlin recognises that sometimes it's better to let eager, young true believers do your dirty work.
One opposition member we spoke to compared Nashi to the Hitler Youth, and while their views are nowhere near as appalling – many are simply young and naive – the certainty in their own righteousness is chilling, and the personality cult around Vladimir Putin is extraordinary.
With talk of the opposition planning another major demonstration on Saturday and more in the weeks to come, it feels like something has changed. The millions of pounds spent turning Nashi into a movement able to call on tens of thousands of state-backed vigilantes suddenly seems like money well spent. Nashi are now an important weapon in the Kremlin's armoury to stifle dissent and could play a crucial role in returning Putin to the presidency next year.
Getty Images The pace of the housing recovery is slowing, and the oversupply of homes could be elevated because of the difficulty so many people face when trying to get a mortgage approved.
The U.S. economic recovery is being endangered by a slowing housing market, as prospective homeowners with lower incomes and credit scores are finding it nearly impossible to get a mortgage.
Six years after the collapse of home prices, the mortgage-lending industry is going through an upheaval. Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, -0.14% has the largest share of the mortgage market, but CEO John Stumpf in an interview with the Financial Times last week said their company would be unwilling to lend to lower-income borrowers and those with relatively low credit scores. That is, unless regulators made it more difficult for investors to force banks to repurchase securitized loans.
“If you guys want to stick with this program of ‘putting back' any time, any way, whatever, that's fine, we're just not going to make those loans and there's going to be a whole bunch of Americans that are underserved in the mortgage market,” Stumpf said.
They were referring to loan-repurchase demands by Fannie Mae FNMA, -2.85% Freddie Mac FMCC, -4.06% and private investors.
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.76% CEO James Dimon, during a July conference call, said the bank's volume of loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration was “way down,” and that the bank had “lost a tremendous sum of money on the FHA,” which had disputed roughly a third of all insurance claims.
“We want to help the consumers there, but we can't do it at great risk to J.P. Morgan, so until they come up with some kind of safe harbors or something, we're going to be very, very cautious in that line of business,” Dimon said.
Even Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said in June: “It is difficult for any homeowner who doesn't have pristine credit these days to get a mortgage,” which was one of the causes of the limp housing recovery.
The pace of home-price increases has slowed for the first time since 2008, according to the latest data from Case-Shiller released last week.
Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. HOV, -0.37% which builds homes in planned communities, said today that for its fiscal third quarter ended July 31, net contracts for new homes declined 6.3% from a year earlier, and its cancellation rate increased to 22% from 18%. CEO Ara Hovnanian said “the housing industry remains in the early stages of a recovery,” which is a remarkable statement, considering how many years have passed since the financial crisis.
Mortgage lending is slowing as well. The Mortgage Bankers Association forecasts a 74% decline in mortgage originations this year to $1 trillion, with a 61% drop in refinancing volume to $431 billion.
To parse those numbers, the decline in refinancing volume was expected, since the federal government's Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, was curtailed dramatically last year. And slowing refinancing itself isn't alarming because so many people with higher-rate loans have already refinanced, and refinancing doesn't raise home values.
But sales do. And the MBA expects the volume of mortgage-loan originations to slump 12% this year to $576 billion. That is happening even though interest rates are still very low, with a national average rate of 4.23% for a 30-year loan.
That is hurting the housing recovery, and the effect could worsen, according to David Blitzer, the managing director and chairperson of the Index Committee at Dow Jones S&P Indices.
S&P/CaseShiller data for July showed the pace of home-price increases in all 20 major cities slowing from a year earlier.
”The lowest quarter of the housing market [by price] will see less demand, fewer sales, fewer increases in price and more decreases in price,” unless the big banks change their mortgage-lending policies, Blitzer said in a phone interview.
Census Bureau information paints a picture that isn't so pretty, at least to Washington policymakers who have tried to increase the share of Americans who own their own homes.
The homeowner vacancy rate during the second quarter was 1.9%, the same as a year earlier. That is the lowest since the recovery from the 2008 housing collapse, although the level has moved up and down several times over the past two years.
Before the construction boom of 2005, the homeowner vacancy rate was below the current rate every year going back to 1956, when records were first kept, except during the recession of 1985. That points to continued oversupply of homes, which together with the decline in mortgage lending, could lead to a softening of prices.
Lawrence Yun, the chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said in a phone interview that 15% more mortgage applications are being denied this year than in 2000, which they described as a “relatively normal” year for the housing market.
The National Association of Realtors said last week that its Pending Home Sales Index for July was 105.9, increasing from 102.5 in June, but down from 108.2 in July 2013. The organization credited the steady increase in employment and a decline in long-term interest rates for the improvement.
On Tuesday, Yun said: “A robust recovery is not occurring. We are projecting a slow recovery in home-sales activity because of the current tight underwriting standards.”
Sterne Agee chief economist Lindsay Piegza on Wednesday said that the negative effect of reducing the pool of potential home buyers “is going to be compounded because younger generations are burdened with such a large amount of debt.”
Even though credit quality is very strong for loans made since 2008, banks continue to shy away from the lower end of the mortgage market. This means that as we head through this economic cycle to the next recession (since they always come), there could be another sharp decline in housing prices, this time based on low demand rather than sloppy lending.

Escaped Christian Schoolgirl Admits Being Raped 15 Times a Day by Boko Haram Islamists
A video released by Islamist militants Boko Haram in May claimed to show around 100 girls kidnapped from a Nigerian Christian school. The group's leader, Abubakar Shekau, said the girls would be held until all imprisoned Islamic militants had been freed.
Boko Haram said the Christian girls converted to Islam.
The girls recited the first chapter of the Koran in the video.
Now this…
A Christian schoolgirl who escaped a Boko Haram camp told authorities they were raped 15 times per day by Islamists.
Spy Ghana reported, via Religion of Peace:
The abducted Christian school girls aged between 13 and 18 must have been raped 1500 times by 1500 different Islamic Jihadists in the name of Allah since the 90 days they have been in abduction. Going by the testimony of one of the escapees from their camp currently receiving emotional therapy from groups of Christian Counsellor the abduction are raped 15 times daily. A Christian councellor by name Oladimeji Thomas had told the press that one of the escaped abductees said they were raped 15 times daily by 15 different men daily. This simply means that within 90 days of abduction, these Christian girls have been raped 15 x 90 days giving 1350 rape per kidnapped girl from 1350 sex starved Jihadists and if the President and their armed forces continues their everlasting strategizing, by the next ten days, making it 100 days in abduction, each of them would have been raped 1500 times. Chibok town has been neglected since the creation of Borno State. The road from Maidugeri, Borno State capital to Chibok, a distance of about 130 km, as at 2010′ long before the Chibok attacks, takes three hours by private transport and three hours and half by public transport due to deplorable state of the road. Vistors from Maidugeri to Chibok, after the trip to the town, will need some medication to put their bones and joints back to order. That is why analgesic drug market hawked at road sides thrives in the town. Chibok Local Government has four primary schools and only one secondary school due to years of neglect, despite the willingness of the Christian community to embrace western education.
New Delhi: Press Council of India Chairperson Justice Markandey Katju today supported the Uniform Civil Code, a controversial core issue of BJP, claiming that one of the reasons for the backwardness of muslims has been that there has been no modernisation of their personal law.
"The issue of a uniform civil code has recently been raised. I am fully in support of a uniform civil code," Katju, a former Supreme Court judge, said in a write-up.
They said that Article 44 of the Indian Constitution states that "The State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India."
The Constitution was made in 1950, and 64 years have passed since it was promulgated, but Article 44 has till now been totally ignored, obviously for vote bank politics, they said.
Katju said that no doubt Article 44 is in the Directive Principles, and not the Fundamental Rights of Constitution, but Article 37 states that "the provisions contained in this Part shall not be enforceable in any court, but the principles therein laid down are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws "
Contending that they have always been raising voice for the rights of Muslims, they said "In fact, one of the reasons for Muslims in India remaining backward is that there was no modernization of their personal law."
Katju said that in all modern countries there is usually one common law for everybody and in India also there is one common criminal law.
"Nobody objected to that, though many of these laws are against the Muslim law. For instance, Muslim law provides for stoning to death for women committing adultery, but that would be illegal under the IPC," Katju wrote.
"That nigga get me hype," Joe tells HipHopDX after doing an impression of the Harlem battler.
Drake isn't the only Head I.C.E fan in mainstrean hip-hop. Fat Joe recently praised (and imitated) the Harlem battler in a conversation with Remy Ma and HipHopDX.
After a discussion about the success of their new single "All The Way Up," Remy Ma and Fat Joe touch on battle rap [at 9:40], with Joe telling a story about how Remy would battle anyone who called them out. They add, "Big Pun used to do that too. Pun would jump out the limo — six niggas is battling in the corner. They would just start killing all these niggas."
Remy also says that she'd consider returning to the ring. Them 2004 Fight Klub clash with Lady Luck (who returned to battling in late 2015) is considered legendary and opened female battle rap to a broader audience.
"I'm actually a fan of battle rap," explains Remy. "I definitely believe because of that battle it opened doors for people to actually wanna watch females ... I feel like one day maybe if I decide I wanna get another bag from somewhere else I would probably start my own battle league with all the dopest chicks. I watch it. I'm a fan of it. I follow it. I personally feel like to this day I would do it again."
At the end of the interview, Joe jumps in with an imitation of Head I.C.E, barking "Don't get it fucked up 'cuz you could get fucked up!" and then adds: "That nigga get me hype."

Training camp is on the horizon. NFL record projections are dropping. The Los Angeles Rams are ready to get rollin.
USA Today has released a full record projection division-by-division, and the Rams projected record will likely not please many Rams fans:
Los Angeles Rams (4-12): They're a young team undergoing significant resets on both sides of the ball. And after opening with two winnable games (Colts, Redskins) at home, the Rams play five of the next six away from the L.A. Coliseum, including a "home" game in London bracketed by East Coast games in Jacksonville and New York.
I don't know if I'd say “significant resets on BOTH sides of the ball”, but I understand their thought process. Not much is known about what to expect in LA next year. It's a new coaching staff with a lot of new players. Anything can happen, but it seems USA Today is not very high on the Rams potential, at least not this year.
If the Rams finished with their projected 4-12 record, they would likely either be picking #3 or #4 in the 2018 NFL Draft, giving the McVay/Phillips duo their first chance to handpick a 1st-round talent.... so, at least there are always some positives to take out of the situation.
BOISE, Idaho — The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has denied Gov. C. L. “Butch” Otter's request for a review of the court's ruling last year that overturned Idaho's ban on gay marriage.
Ernest McGray, Jr.
Otter had requested that an 11-judge panel review the October decision by three judges that Idaho's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional. On Friday, the 9th Circuit rejected Otter's request.
Three judges dissented from the majority, noting that a 6th Circuit decision upheld similar laws in four states.
“Clearly, the same-sex marriage debate is not over,” the three said in a 25-page dissent, adding that “thoughtful, dedicated jurists” have considered the issue and come up with differing results. The dissenting judges called the issue a “question of exceptional importance” that should have been reviewed.
Gay couples have been able to marry since shortly after the original appellate court ruling. Four lesbian couples filed the lawsuit challenging the state's marriage ban.
The National Center for Lesbian Rights praised Friday's decision, saying the original three-judge ruling was consistent with other federal judicial decisions, “which have rightly concluded that our Constitution cannot tolerate the profound harm that denying same-sex couples the freedom to marry inflicts (on) those couples and their children.”
Article continues below
Last week, Otter and Idaho's attorney general filed separate petitions to the U.S. Supreme Court, fighting against gay marriage and arguing that the state's case has national consequences.
Attorney General Lawrence Wasden's filing stated that the issue is a matter of a state's right to define marriage without the federal government's involvement.
Otter asked the Supreme Court to review Idaho's case alone or in addition to a pending case involving the 6th Circuit, which upheld the right of Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee to decide whether to allow gay marriage.
Otter's petition maintains that unlike in other states, Idaho's public officials have not shied away from defending a broad definition of heterosexual marriage.

History and Lore
Moonville was a coal-mining town founded in the middle of the nineteenth century in Vinton County. Its population peaked in 1870 when about 100 people lived there, after which it declined. The last family in Moonville left in 1947. Moonville's nearest neighbor was the town of Hope, but even Hope was many miles away. To connect the two towns a railroad was laid. During the course of its construction, it was also necessary to build bridges over creeks and to excavate Moonville Tunnel to pass through a nearby hillside.
Years have passed since both Moonville and Hope were abandoned. The buildings are gone, and even the tracks for the railroad have disappeared. All that remains of Moonville is a cemetery and Moonville Tunnel. The abandoned tunnel is now located within Zaleski State Forest.
There are many, many places in Ohio that are said to be haunted. If you fire up your favorite search engine and look for “Ohio” and “haunted,” you'll find hundreds of stories. When I tried this at Google, the search engine returned 559,000 results. If you wander into a local bookstore, you are likely to find a number of books about Ohio's haunted places.
If I do another web search and add the search term of “Moonville” to “Ohio” and “haunted,” I still get an impressive 11,400 results. I have included links to a few websites describing Moonville's supernatural history in “Additional information” at the end of this article.
I think the abandoned town's unusual name, Moonville, contributes to the area's spookiness. However, there are supposedly a number of tragic accidents associated with the old railroad. Five or six people have been killed when struck by a train while walking on a bridge or in a tunnel. There is graffiti within the tunnel which portrays one of these incidents.
However at TrekOhio, we are all about hiking, so for the remainder of this article I'm going to focus on the trails and the natural setting of Zaleski State Forest in the vicinity of Moonville Tunnel.
Getting oriented
There are still a couple of ways to hike to Moonville Tunnel: either park near the trailhead for the Moonville Rail Trail and walk across Raccoon Creek on the new footbridge (about 500 feet to the tunnel), or park just off of Hope-Moonville Road near the spot where the road crosses Raccoon Creek and hike in on the Moonville High Water Trail (about a quarter mile to the tunnel). Below is a screenshot that shows a GPS trace of us hiking to the tunnel via the Moonville High Water Trail (the top, vertical red path). The horizontal, red path shows the portion of the Moonville Rail Trail that sits between two stream crossings (on the left, Raccoon Creek, and on the right, Hewett Fork). The distance between the two stream crossings is a little less than a half mile. I also added a dark blue marker showing the driveway to the new parking lot for the Moonville Rail Trail, and a dark blue path showing the route to the new footbridge.
Below I'll discuss getting to the tunnel via the Moonville Rail Trail, followed by a description of hiking on the Moonville High Water Trail to the tunnel.
The New Footbridge to the Tunnel on Moonville Rail Trail
Until late 2016 if you tried to approach the tunnel via the Moonville Rail Trail, you had to wade across Raccoon Creek. Although you could still see the pylons that used to support the old railroad trestle, there was no bridge. For old time's sake, here are a couple of photos showing what that crossing was like.
But as of late 2016 visitors can just sashay across Raccoon Creek on the new footbridge. It was built on top of the pylons that used to support the railway trestle.
In addition to the new footbridge, there is a parking lot for visitors at the start of the Moonville Rail Trail. Below I'm looking back at the parking lot after crossing the footbridge. As you can see, the height of the bridge is a lot lower than the land on either side of it.
And for comparison, this is what it was like looking back across Raccoon Creek before the new footbridge and parking lot.
The Tunnel Itself
Below are a couple of photos showing the mouth of the tunnel in different seasons.
Moonville High Water Trail
If you want to go the tunnel via the Moonville High Water Trail, you will find limited off-road parking near the bridge pictured below on the Hope-Moonville Road. Note that it's a dirt road.
When looking toward the bridge shown above, the trailhead is to the left.
It is a short and pleasant hike to the tunnel with much of the hike next to Raccoon Creek. The trail passes by the rock shelter pictured below.
Hiking Beyond the Tunnel on the Moonville Rail Trail
After exploring the tunnel, if you like you can continue following the Moonville Rail Trail to Hewett Fork. Since it is rail trail, the path is level with hills to your left and lowlands to your right. As you draw near Hewett Fork you might catch a glimpse of cliffs to your left if you go while the leaves are off the trees. To your right you will see a plain that's quite a bit lower than the rail bed.
I included the above, not-so-picturesque photo of the low area beside the rail bed because it is the only place in Ohio where we've spotted bears while hiking. We caught sight of the rumps of two cinnamon-colored, black bears running away from us on this plain. The bears were out of sight before I could get my camera ready, but it was fun seeing them (especially since they were running away from us). Since I don't have a photo of them, I'm including a photo below of similar bears that was taken by Neal Herbert of the National Park Service.
There is no bridge at Hewett Fork, so if you wanted to continue on you would have to wade across it.
It's quite a distance away, but if you kept going you would eventually reach another old railway tunnel in Zaleski State Forest, King's Hollow Tunnel.
Flora and Fauna
Although not as exciting as seeing a bear, here's a look at some of the natural features of this area.

Not too long ago, I helped someone with some research work, and one of the research tools was also used from the Python interactive prompt.
The interface used was handy enough for development: intuitive, readable, short, and useful. Still, for interactive research it wasn't handy enough.
To improve the script, I decided to use a trick I heard about a long time ago – using __repr__:
class NoParens ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , obj ) : self . obj = obj def __call__ ( self , * args, ** kwargs ) : return self . obj ( * args, ** kwargs ) def __repr__ ( self ) : result = self . obj ( ) return str ( result )
And using it looks like this:
In [ 2 ] : import noparens In [ 3 ] : def test ( ) : ...: return 4 ** 4 ...: In [ 4 ] : t = noparens. NoParens ( test ) In [ 5 ] : t Out [ 5 ] : 256 In [ 6 ] : t,t,t Out [ 6 ] : ( 256 , 256 , 256 )
For research consoles that interact with other programs or devices, such as debuggers and sniffers I found this useful, and made work a bit less annoying.
Treasure Box is the first puzzle mini-game unlocked in the Seeker's Notes: Hidden Mystery game.
Treasure Box is a match 3 of the same type game. The Player must swap and match in a combination of three or more of the same color gems to clear the game board. A time limit is given to complete the challenge. At higher Ranks there are increasingly more difficult challenges and obstacles to clear and less time to complete the task.
Treasure Box is unlocked at Game Level 3. Players starting a new game will be taken through a tutorial on the puzzle's gameplay.
Contents show]
Game Modes Edit
There are 3 challenge modes in Treasure Box. Tapping on the icon will tell you what mode is on and what you need to do to win the game in that mode.
Mode Icon Aim Plates Mode Remove all the brown and silver plates by making matches over them Palette Mode Remove a set amount of certain colored Gems by making matches of those colors Stargazer Mode Maneuver the Star, Moon and Saturn into the caskets
If the Player is unsuccessful in completing the puzzle in a certain game mode, it will unfortunately remain in that mode until completed.
How to Play Edit
The object of the game is to match and combine 3 or more of the same colored gems. Gems come in six colors; match at least three of them with the same color in a line, across or down, to complete the challenge within the set time limit. Each session will have a new challenge goal as shown on the progress bar located next to the timer on the game panel.
Special Gem Types Edit
Players are able to create 3 special types of gems in Treasure Box: the Striped Gem, the Bomb Gem, and the Rainbow Gem. Learning how to create these special gems will prove invaluable in clearing the board and makes completing the goal much faster and easier.
Gem Type Icon Formation Function Striped Gem Match 4 same colored Gems in a line across or down Removes all Gems in the same row (if horizontal striped) or column (if vertical striped) Bomb Gem Match 5 same colored Gems in an L or T shape Removes all adjacent Gems in its vicinity in a 3x3 square radius Rainbow Gem Match 5 same colored Gems in a line across or down Removes all Gems of the same color from the board
Special Gem Combo Moves Edit
Players are able to combine the special gems together to create special configurations with its own unique amplified effects. The combo moves are extremely useful in clearing a large amount of gems from the game board at one time.
Combo Formation Function Gem 1 Gem 2 Striped + Striped removes one entire row and one entire column Striped+ Bomb creates a Mega Striped Gem that removes three rows and three columns at same time Bomb + Bomb removes all adjacent gems in its vicinity with larger area of effect than single bomb Rainbow + Striped transforms all the gems of the same color into striped Gems with random horizontal and vertical stripes Rainbow + Bomb removes 2 gem colors from the board Rainbow + Rainbow removes all gems from the game board
If the Player is stuck and does not make a match within 5 seconds, the game will provide a hint by highlighting a possible match with "dancing gems". If there are no possible matches left on the game board, the board will reshuffle itself.
The Player will sometimes encounter obstacles such as locked gems and/or stones. These are removed by triggering a match of 3 or more.
Matches Illustrated Edit
Matching 3 of the same colored gems in a line will clear those 3 gems from the board as well as any surrounding obstacles such as stones and plates. As the gems are removed, adjacent gems will fill the empty space created and new gems will fall from the top of the game board. To get three matches you must align three of the same colored gem either vertically or horizontally. This is the most basic match you can make.
Matching 4 of the same will create a Striped Gem of that color, either vertically or horizontally striped. The direction of the stripe depends on how the match combination was formed: forming a line match across results in a horizontal stripe while forming a line match up or down results in a vertical stripe. Making a match with a Striped Gem will trigger it to remove all the gems in the row (if horizontally striped) or column (if vertically striped) that it is found in. It is better to match 4 gems together whenever possible because the striped gems produce line blasts that will clear all gems in the same line, either horizontally or vertically.
Matching a Striped Gem with another Striped Gem of any color and stripe will activate them, and trigger the removal of all gems in both the row plus the column they are in. One gem will clear a vertical column and the other gem will clear a horizontal row, forming a plus sign effect. Note that if both gems have stripes facing the same direction, one will be randomly switched to facilitate this effect.
Matching 5 of the same in a T-shape or L-shape will create a Bomb Gem of that same color. Making a match with a Bomb will trigger it to explode and remove all adjacent gems from the board as well as trigger any adjacent special Gems in the immediate vicinity of the blast zone. When activated, the Bomb Gem will explode once and clear the surrounding gems in a 6×6 square blast radius.
Matching a Bomb with a Striped Gem of any color will create a Mega Striped Gem that clears three rows and three columns at once, forming a plus sign effect similar to the striped + striped gem combo, only 3x bigger. A good amount of the board is cleared with this Mega Striped Gem combo move.
Matching a Bomb with another Bomb of any color will trigger a chain explosion that removes any adjacent gems in the vicinity. A bigger explosion than the single Bomb effect occurs as each of the Bombs will explode twice and clear the surrounding gems in a 6×6 square blast radius. This Double Bomb move is most effective at clearing obstacles such as plates and stones.
of the same in a line across or down will create a Rainbow Gem. A Rainbow Gem's effect is activated by switching it with any gem color that is adjacent to it, causing it to find and remove all of that same gem color from the board. This move is most helpful in clearing and activating gems of a specific color (i.e. for the hard-to-reach gems or to activate a certain gem for its effect).
Matching a Rainbow with a Striped Gem will trigger it to find gems of that same color, transforming all gems of that color into Striped Gems (both horizontal and vertical at random) and then activating these transformed gems. This is one of the best combo moves to make as it will clear a major portion of the board.
Matching a Rainbow with a Bomb will cause the Rainbow to randomly choose 2 colors of gems to remove from the board. This is the least effective special combo move since there is no control over which color gems will be cleared.
Matching a Rainbow with a Rainbow will cause both Rainbow Gems to cycle through its prism and remove all colors from the game board - your entire board will be momentarily cleared in a laser light show! This is a great combo move to make, although forming 2 Rainbows in close proximity is not easy to do.
There are two tools available to use in Treasure Box:
Tool Icon Use Flying Time Adds an additional 45 seconds of game play to the game's timer Eyeglass Randomly removes one gem obstacle in the challenge

“The refined soul yearns to know the truth of everything.”
—Azariah de Rossi, Meor ‘Einayim–1574

With the expulsions of the Jews from England in 1290, from France between 1182 and 1394, from Spain in 1492, from Portugal in 1497, and from Navarre in 1498, Western Europe had been emptied of its Jewish population. Exiled Jews sought refuge wherever they could, some fleeing Christendom altogether and alighting in North Africa or in the Ottoman Empire. Other beleaguered Jews made their way to the Italian Peninsula, where they found established Jewish communities, some dating back to antiquity and the height of the ancient Roman Empire. Over the centuries, these Italian Jews had developed their own unique cultural traditions, creating a small but innovative literary corpus of liturgical poetry, lexicography, medicine, science, and mysticism. The ancient and medieval populations of Italian Jewry had been centered in Rome and in the southern part of the Peninsula. Though the city of Rome itself sustained the one continuous site of Jewish settlement in Europe from antiquity to the present, in time the southern communities, especially the once vibrant regions of Sicily and Naples declined under foreign rule, and the locus of Italian Jewry shifted northward.
Abraham Ortelius. Italiae novissima descripto. Antwerp, 1579.
To a great extent, the Jews of Italy flourished during the Renaissance, a period marked by a humanistic revival of classical influences, expressed in a flowering of the arts and literature, and by the beginnings of modern science. The commercial success of Italian Jews in this period was aided by the same factors that had prevailed elsewhere: the systematic exclusion of Jews from certain traditional occupations, coupled with the ecclesiastical approval of Jewish moneylending. Many central and northern Italian city-states found themselves issuing condotte (charters) to wealthy Jewish individuals who could serve as loan-bankers and help finance both public and private undertakings. The necessarily close connections with important and powerful Christian families who oversaw these projects, led to a high degree of integration of these Jewish bankers into Italian society.
The concentration of economic power in a small number of relatively affluent banking families had a lasting impact on the ongoing development of Jewish cultural life in Italy, as many of the Jewish bankers also became patrons of the arts and sciences. Major figures of Jewish culture – including rabbinic scholars, poets, physicians, philosophers, historians, grammarians, and scribes – found themselves aligned with these families. Their intellectual and artistic endeavors were supported by a handful of privileged patrons, not unlike their counterparts in Christian society.
The cultural milieu of the Italian Renaissance led to a broad range of Jewish-Christian social interaction. One conspicuous example was the large number of Jewish physicians. Although Jews had long been drawn to the practice of medicine, most Christian European universities and medical schools barred Jews from attending. Italian universities however, notably those of Padua and Perugia, were among the few that allowed Jews to enter the medical faculties. The Jewish graduates of these schools were highly sought after and Jewish doctors frequently acted as personal physicians to popes, cardinals, bishops, and dukes.
The Jews of Italy were also extremely prolific in the creation of printed books. The invention of the printing press and movable type meant that books could be produced in large quantities. The Jews of Italy eagerly seized upon this new technology, establishing presses in more than a dozen Italian cities and towns. Italian Jewish printers were responsible for producing more than three quarters of all Hebrew books printed during the fifteenth century.
Detail of lot 55. Photographs by Ardon Bar-Hama.
Despite the rise of printing as a means of book production, the most glorious volumes of Hebrew text produced in the Italian Renaissance era were elaborately illuminated and decorated manuscripts. Painstakingly penned on especially fine prepared parchment by trained scribes, these exquisite books were artistically embellished with meticulously prepared pigments, gilded and silvered with precious metals, richly lined in silks and fabrics, and bound in supple leathers. While these works were obviously commissioned by wealthy Jewish patrons, it was not uncommon for experienced Christian illuminators to be called upon to decorate the most important and finest examples of Hebrew manuscripts. Most of these breathtakingly beautiful illuminated manuscripts were religious texts, often biblical or liturgical in nature. The most important works of Jewish jurisprudence, such as Jacob ben Asher's Arba'ah Turim or Maimonides' Mishneh Torah were also sometimes singled out for this kind of special treatment, a clear indication of the esteem in which the Jews of the Italian Renaissance held the legal tradition that was so fundamental and essential to their Jewish identity.
Detail of lot 55. Photographs by Ardon Bar-Hama.
The Italian Jewish experience was not however without its drawbacks. There remained sharp reminders that the Jews, though they might in many ways be integrated, were nevertheless distinct from their non-Jewish neighbors. The close degree of integration in Italian society virtually guaranteed that the Jews could not avoid the effects of the intellectual currents that roiled the Christian world and led to the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation. Jews still suffered from false accusations of ritual murder, most infamously in the case of Simon of Trent in 1475. In 1516, the Jews of Venice were forced to relocate to a single segregated neighborhood, the first ghetto; similar separations were soon reprised in many Italian cities. In 1555, Pope Paul IV brutally reversed the fortunes of the Jews in the Papal States and later presided over the execution of Jewish refugees of Spanish descent in the port city of Ancona. Notwithstanding these severe and critical challenges, some existential in nature, the flourishing of the Jews in Italy was unlike anything the Jews of Europe had known since the Golden Age of Iberian Jewry centuries before. Jewish scholarship and culture thrived unabated, not least of all in the traditional Jewish areas of halakhah (Jewish law) and kabbalah (Jewish mysticism). In more secular pursuits, including theater, music, literature, and the sciences, the Jews of Italy created a legacy of which they could be proud. The accomplishments of Italian Jewry would serve as a yardstick against which Jews of other lands could measure their own achievements in the coming years.

As Republicans rally behind a big push for tax cuts, expect to hear one idea over and over: that a major goal of reform is to make the tax code so simple you could file your taxes on a postcard.
Paul Ryan floated this notion — complete with a postcard mock-up — in their 2016 campaign policy document “A Better Way.” And according to Majority Whip Steve Scalise, as quoted by Jeremy Beaman in the Washington Examiner, this is an idea that “gets people excited” about tax reform. That's a key messaging goal for Republicans because the actual underlying policy objective — reducing the tax rate paid by very rich people and large corporations — isn't popular, so you need to yoke it to something that is popular, like filing your taxes on a postcard.
As Ryan said in an August 8 speech on taxes to business leaders, “We will consolidate the existing seven brackets into three, double the standard deduction, and simplify things to the point that you can do your taxes on a form the size of a postcard. This, instead of the 1040 form. Wouldn't that be nice?”
It would be pretty nice. That said, the ideas Ryan is proposing are neither necessary nor sufficient to achieve that goal. Republican tax plans feature large, costly changes that have nothing to do with simplifying the process of filling out tax forms. And they also retain features of the existing tax code that require some people to engage in fairly laborious paperwork in order to do their taxes properly — solving the problem by filling their model postcard with hand waving and asterisks.
Fundamentally, greatly simplifying tax compliance for a majority of Americans doesn't require changing the tax code at all — it simply requires challenging the entrenched lobbying power of the accounting industry and tax prep software vendors.
Paul Ryan's postcard is more complicated than it seems
The postcard mocked up by the House Ways and Means Committee, the body that writes tax legislation in the lower House, does indeed look pretty simple at first glance:
But there are two main issues.
One is that line 3's reference to “specified savings plans” is completely punting on the question of what the specified savings plans are.
The other is that in lines 9, 10, and 11, the form achieves simplicity by saying nothing at all about what the relevant credits are or who is eligible to claim them and in what quantity.
To make either of these provisions work, you would, in practice, need to work with some additional forms. The postcard would just be a starting point. The existing IRS tax compliance process essentially arrives at the same conclusion in reverse. For people with simple tax situations that don't involve claiming these credits or making contributions to special tax-preferred accounts, you already don't need to fill out Form 1040. Instead you use Form 1040 EZ (it's easy, get it?) which looks a lot like Ryan's postcard.
The big reason that 1040 EZ takes up a full page rather than getting down to postcard size is that the IRS made room for boring stuff like your name, address, and Social Security number. They have a place for you to sign your name, and also a place for your accountant to sign their name if they helped you with your taxes. If you're a married couple filing jointly, they have space for your spouse's name and signature. The IRS lets you say which bank account you'd like to have your refund deposited in.
It's possible that rather than using a standard 8.5 x 11 inch sheet of paper, you could fit this extra stuff onto the back side of a postcard. On the other hand, you might prefer to have your personal financial information in a sealed envelope rather than slap it on the outside of a postcard that any mail carrier can read.
Either way, this is a page layout problem and not a tax policy problem. And Republicans' key tax policy ideas — that rates should be lowed and less progressive, and that investment income should receive favorable treatment — play no role in the simplification.
Cutting rates and brackets doesn't simplify things
Both form 1040 EZ and the Better Way postcard gain themselves a great deal of simplicity by telling people to compute their actual taxes owed by consulting a separately published tax table. That's where the different rates and brackets are applied to translate a given amount of taxable income into a given amount of taxes that you need to pay. The Better Way doesn't do away with the need to consult the tax table.
And as long as you are consulting a tax table, the key element of the Better Way plan — consolidating the existing array of tax brackets into only three, leaving high-income tax payers to pay at a much lower rate — is playing no simplification role at all. With the assistance of a handy tax table, you could easily have a system with a dozen — or even two dozen — brackets. The only real limitation is how many lines you can fit on a page.
Indeed, if instead of asking people to check a paper table you had them plug a number into a website or a mobile phone app, you could use calculus to devise a system with an infinite number of infinitesimal tax brackets without meaningfully making the system more complicated. Yet these tax changes are a really big deal. According to the Tax Policy Center, they could reduce federal tax revenue by as much as $7.8 trillion over the span of ten years. If Republicans get as bold as they sometimes say they will about eliminating deductions, that number might get down to “only” $3.5 trillion. Under either scenario, multi-millionaires in the top 0.1 percent of the population are looking at an enormous windfall that will boost their after-tax incomes by 12-20 percent.
Middle class families would get relatively little. And if that multi-trillion dollar revenue hole is actually offset by spending cuts as Republicans say they want to do, middle class families will end up worse off.
Yet if Congress were willing to challenge the entrenched interests of companies like H&R Block and Intuit, it would be possible to achieve much greater simplification than Ryan or Trump is promising without any loss of revenue.
Radical tax simplification is easy
Japan, the United Kingdom, and several other countries have adopted a system known as “precision withholding” that lets taxpayers avoid filing any kind of tax return at all. The tax return, at the end of the day, is an anachronistic legacy of the old days of paper record-keeping when it wouldn't have been feasible to calculate taxes without outsourcing a huge share of the work to individual families.
These days, in countries that have implemented modern tax systems, the tax agency simply takes exactly the right amount out of every paycheck. If they find that a mistake was made — not accounting for a charitable donation or mortgage interest, for example — they find that mistake in charity and bank records, and they fix it for you. In journalist T.R. Reid's great new book A Fine Mess, they explain how the Japanese system works:
Japan's equivalent of the IRS, Kokuzeicho, gathers all the pertinent data for each worker — income, taxable benefits, number of personal exemptions, tax withheld, and so on — and then computes how much the worker owes in tax, down to the last yen. Because Japan uses a system known as "precision withholding," with the amount changing whenever pay goes up or down, most people withhold the exact amount due. In early March, Kokuzeicho sends a postcard to every citizen that sets forth all this information: how much you earned, how much tax you owe, how much tax you've already paid through withholding. If you've paid in more tax than you owe, Kokuzeicho deposits the refund amount in your bank account; if you did not withhold enough, the agency takes the tax that's due from your bank account. … As a result, paying income tax is a totally automatic process for about 80 percent of Japanese households, requiring no more work than reading a postcard once a year.
Japan's top income tax bracket is 45 percent, by the way, and it's levied on incomes of over $350,000 a year. There is absolutely no need to bundle this kind of radical tax simplification with giant tax cuts. It's easy to file your taxes in Japan because the Japanese government decided to make it a priority.
That's a choice that American conservatives have fought against, tooth and nail, with the help of predatory tax services companies like H&R Block and Intuit (the makers of TurboTax). When Sens. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Dan Coats (R-IN) introduced a fairly timid, intentionally bipartisan tax reform bill in 2011 and included a proposal for return-free filing, anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist blasted it, writing in a letter to the senators that “the clear goal of this measure is to raise taxes in a way that leaves politicians with clean hands.” Norquist wants to make taxes complicated so people hate them, just as Intuit wants them complicated so that people remain dependent on its terrible, unnecessary software.
Back in 2016, Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) proposed a kind of intermediary step to the Japanese system — sponsoring legislation that would direct the IRS to develop its own in-house tax prep software that would make it free and easy for normal people to file their taxes. Hillary Clinton endorsed their plan, as did Bernie Sanders, Al Franken, Tammy Baldwin, and other Senate Democrats. But postcard-touting Republicans haven't been interested.
A Democratic member of congress was not pleased with President Trump's remarks about the violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia yesterday and has called for the president to be removed from office. No, it's not Maxine “Ragin'” Waters (D-CA); it's Rep. Gwen Moore (D-WI).
The president blamed both sides for the violence that occurred last Saturday, where white nationalists were protesting the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue. Left wing counterprotesters arrived and brawls broke out. Many were sent to the hospital, but the day took a very tragic turn when a white nationalist—James Alex Fields Jr.—plowed through a bunch of counterprotesters, injuring 19 and killing one woman. There is no doubt that the fact that a white nationalist killed a woman changes the game. Antifa and their left wing allies are bullying thugs. They're violent. They cause trouble, but their absurd antics didn't lead to someone's death in this case. Overall, yes, you cannot have a discussion about the heated political rhetoric and anti-free speech antics occurring in this country without talking about and condemning Antifa as well. Yet, that's in a general sense. With regards to Charlottesville, you can still say Antifa are thugs, which they are, but the level of violence committed from both sides was not equal due to the vehicle attack. That being said, I don't feel that a statement with which you find disagreement is cause for impeachment (via The Hill):
On Tuesday, Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) took that argument a long step forward, urging the removal of Trump, as well. Moore, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), said Trump's remarks on Tuesday defending some of the white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville — while blaming counter-protesters, in part, for the eruption of violence — is evidence enough that Trump is unfit to serve as president of a country derived of multiculturalism. “As we once again hear Donald Trump defend those responsible for the deadly riot in Charlottesville and receive praise by hate groups like the KKK and neo-Nazis, the time has come for Republicans and Democrats to put aside our political differences and philosophical debates for a higher cause,” Moore said in a brief statement. “For the sake of the soul of our country, we must come together to restore our national dignity that has been robbed by Donald Trump's presence in the White House,” they added. “My Republican friends, I implore you to work with us within our capacity as elected officials to remove this man as our commander-in-chief and help us move forward from this dark period in our nation's history.”
Trump removed from office because you don't like what they said; that's not going to happen.
Daily Telegraph Science editor Sarah Knapton was sharply criticized Wednesday for a story they wrote touting the claim e-cigarettes are no safer than smoking tobacco.
The subject of Knapton's piece, published Tuesday with the headline “E-cigarettes are no safer than smoking tobacco, scientists warn,” was a study conducted by a research team at the University of California, San Diego. The team investigated how e-cigarettes may contribute to the development and progression of head and neck cancer.
One of the most eye-catching parts of the study's press release was a claim made by lead author Dr. Jessica Wang-Rodriguez, who said, “I believe they (e-cigarettes) are no better than smoking regular cigarettes.”
Media outlets across the world picked up the claim and ran headlines including “Vaping no better than smoking regular cigarettes” and “Health warning for ex-smokers: E-cigarettes ‘may cause cancer' says shock report.”
A host of medical and public health professionals, however, disagree with Wang-Rodriguez. The study itself was criticized for its methodology and conclusions, in addition to the accompanying press release.
Knapton's piece elicited an especially scathing response. And even more so after they tweeted Wednesday “all the latest evidence points to e-cig vapour being just as harmful as tobacco.”
@ronnners Yes but that's just the point. All the latest evidence points to e-cig vapour being just as harmful as tobacco — Sarah Knapton (@sarahknapton) December 30, 2015
Medical statistician Adam Jacobs, writing at Stats Guy, labelled Knapton's piece the “most dangerous, irresponsible, and ill-informed piece of health journalism of 2015.”
Worst health scare story of 2015? https://t.co/m5zN2xoYpr — Tim Harford (@TimHarford) December 30, 2015
Long-time anti-tobacco activist and former director of the United Kingdom's Action on Smoking (ASH) and Health Clive Bates wrote an open letter to Knapton, challenging their coverage of the story.
Bates responded in the letter to Knapton's claim they were being trolled by vapers. “[T]he Telegraph just took the press release claim at face value and made a headline of it,” they wrote. “If a troll is ‘a person who makes a deliberately offensive or provocative online posting' perhaps it is the Telegraph that is trolling vapers and the nation, not vapers trolling you?”

Due to heavy fishing and a lack of local regulation, the largest fish in the Amazon River basin is close to extinct, according to a journal published this month titled Aquatic Conservation: Freshwater and Marine Ecosystems.
The species is called “arapaima” — or, in Brazil, “pirarucu.” The fish are behemoths, as long as 10 feet and weighing up to 440 pounds. Arapaima is carnivorous, feeding primarily on smaller fish and occasionally birds, according to National Geographic.
Unlike many other species of fish, the arapaima are able to breathe air through a primitive lung as well as gills. They swim to the surface fairly often, making them vulnerable to local fishermen.
According to the study, the arapaima is already extinct in 19 percent of the 81 communities surveyed.

Leandro Castello, an assistant professor of fisheries at Virginia Tech who led the research, criticized the Brazilian government's assertion that scarcity would drive up the cost of fishing arapaima, helping save the depleted species. As Castello pointed out, “If that prediction were true, extinctions induced by fishing would not exist, but that is not what has happened.”
There is still some hope that the fish could avoid extinction. Although only 27 percent of the communities surveyed regulate arapaima fishing, the fish are reportedly surviving in those areas.

I received some e-mail asking about Outworld Devourer's performance during the International. It kinda fit an idea I had for examining the interaction between particular heroes and the overall metagame, so let's have at it.
As was brought up in the e-mail, OD is a curious case. They were highly relevant in drafting, but they were also unsuccessful when it came down to wins and losses. They were the most banned hero of the event, with a 73% ban rate that edges out Batrider at 70% and Wisp at 67%. At the same time, they were 12-21 over 33 games for a .364 win rate. The only heroes less successful with at least 15 games played were Sand King (3-12, .200) and Enchantress (8-15, .348). So how do we explain what's going on here?
Let's start by talking about their strengths and weaknesses. What people like from them is that they are a significant carry threat when a tendency to dominate mid lane 1v1 matchups. Astral Imprisonment gives them a great degree of lane control and last hitting potential while simultaneously starving their opponent out of mana. The effect is amplified against popular Intelligence mids like Puck, Storm Spirit, and Queen of Pain because not only is they removing their ability to wave clear by starving them of mana, he's also draining them of their intelligence-derived base damage.
The big strategic downside to all of this is that their carry potential is very snowball dependent. Unlike most carries, a huge portion of their damage comes from an orb affect, and is therefore completely shut down by BKB use. This also makes them one of the worst carries in the game when it comes to tower pushing. What OD really wants is to win early teamfights and skirmishes hard. This creates a level gap where it becomes impossible to stand up against him, thanks in part to the unique damage scaling on their ultimate. One hero you could compare them to is Clinkz in the way that both heroes are dependent on a strong early game that transitions to a completely dominant mid game presence. Another comparison is Ursa in that both heroes can put out absurd amounts of damage but are vulnerable to having that damage countered by eventual item purchases from the enemy team (BKB for OD, Force Staff and Ghost Scepter for Ursa).
With that out of the way, let's move on to their International performance. One of the first things to look at when trying to figure out whether a tournament win rate is legitimate or not is the distribution of the teams using the hero. A hero's win rate can be greatly influenced by a small handful of teams that simply run the hero more often than everyone else, but for OD I don't suspect this is the case.
The three teams with the most OD games were iG, Fnatic, and Liquid, all of which had better than .500 records. Sure you have struggling teams like mouz and MUFC going 0-2 with the hero, but you also have DK and Orange going 0-2 with the hero. The only outstanding outlier here is iG's 4-1 record, and it's admittedly a relatively significant outlier that includes wins against DK and Orange.
The real culprit when it comes to Outworld Devourer's win rate is counterpicking, and in particular Razor. OD's win rate against Razor was 1-7 (.125). If you remove Razor games from OD's overall W-L, you're left with an 11-14 (.440) record, which isn't amazing but also isn't terribly significant given the sample size.
You can actually see the counter-picking dance around OD if you look at a lot of the drafts that they were selected in, particularly involving Na`Vi. For instance in Na`Vi vs Dignitas during the group stages, Dignitas picks OD with the 3rd overall selection, and Na`Vi responds with Razor in the fourth. Similar responses occur in Na`Vi vs MUFC and Na`Vi vs DK. Na`Vi vs Zenith has Zenith selecting Razor with their first pick in order to protect their second pick OD. Another example of this is Orange vs Liquid, in which Liquid covers an OD selection with Razor in an attempt to deny Orange OD (Orange received the most first round OD bans of any team during the prelims). In doing so, they gave up both Nature's Prophet and Dark Seer to Orange and also ate a Clockwerk ban which forced their off-lane to run Tinker.
As you can see, OD can become a pretty expensive pick, and nowhere is this more apparent than Orange vs Alliance during the group stages. As I mentioned, Orange received the most first round OD bans during the prelims, but this is the only game during the prelims that Orange actually gets to use the hero. With the final pick of the first round, Orange takes OD. They spend their next two bans on Razor and Viper in an attempt to eliminate counterpicks. They then target their final ban at Beastmaster (3-0 against OD during the tournament), only to have Alliance take Kunkka. Certainly Kunkka isn't Alliance's mid of choice, but they do well enough, and in the process of trying to get OD a good matchup Orange let Alliance grab one of their preferred Wisp combos (Wisp+Gyro), Akke's Chen, and Bulldog's Prophet.
Basically, OD right now is a relatively hard counterpick against certain mids but is at the same time just as vulnerable to counterpicking. They struggle against strong laners with negligible mana cost (Razor, Viper, Kunkka, Lone Druid) and they often lose in the long run to utility mids that don't need to contest the lane and can give them problems outside of laning (Beastmaster, Nyx somtimes). If you pick them early, a TI3-calibur team can draft around him. If you pick them late, a team can just spend one of their less valuable 2nd or 3rd round bans to protect their mid-laner. Given this dynamic he's absolutely relevant to the metagame, but in your average game he's almost more useful as a threat than they are an actual selection.

Williams Hudson Bay Farm in Walla Walla, Wash. Photo by Melanie Conner
What happens when a story about saving organic farmland isn't about a small farmer trying to make a go of it, but rather larger growers trying to do the right thing with a bigger stretch of land?
PCC Farmland Trust is saving another farm. But this latest project is different than some of our past work. This is a tale of continuity, on a larger scale, and with timely regional and political relevance.
Ray and Tom Williams, along with their wives Melinda Eden and Penny Hawkins, are the owners of Williams Hudson Bay Farm — located just outside the city of Walla Walla, near the Oregon border in the Walla Walla River Valley. What historically was the Hudson Bay Trading Company's farm during the mid-1800s now covers more than 3,000 acres of organically certified, Salmon-Safe farmland.
It's a highly diverse organic operation. Organic wheat, alfalfa seed, barley, beans, corn, onions, and more compose the different panels of a colorful quilt of fields along the rolling slopes of the valley. Red-tailed hawks shriek and circle in the mammoth sky above as organic heifers mosey and chew.
Bright sun, clouds, shadows and wind are the stars of this landscape and the light ignites a neighbor's bright yellow canola field stretching out into the hilly distance. Rows of wind turbines make up an assertive border on the northern and southern crests.
PCC Farmland Trust, in partnership with the Natural Resources Conservation Service's (NRCS) Farm and Ranch Land Protection Program (FRPP), has acquired an organic agricultural conservation easement on 300 acres of the Williams' farm.
It always is a good day when farmland is no longer under threat. But in this case, after a year and a half of work, there is special call for celebration. In an area where the overwhelming majority of agriculture is conventional, now at least 300 acres will be organic and protected from development forever.

The complexity of the whole farm is remarkable when you visit the property. There is such a diversity of things going on, it's like conducting a symphony — only with a lot more tractors and irrigation tape. When hitting the occasional sour note of crop failure, weather setback, or stubborn pest, farmers must guide the farm back into a successful crescendo, using cover crops, rotations, good pest management and sheer force of will.
Ray and Tom Williams, the conductors responsible for making all the parts of the farm harmonize, are smart, unassuming and often self-deprecating — not an unusual combination of traits amongst farmers. The two brothers volley good-naturedly back and forth during conversation, correcting each other, finishing one another's sentences, and talking shop.
A visit with Ray and Tom is equally likely to delve into global socioeconomics, the weather, the latest in sprinkler technology, or the politics of genetically engineered alfalfa.
They are two local boys made good. Starting with a grandfather who was born in Kansas but moved West, the lineage continued with the Williams' father, Tom Williams Sr., who ran the farm into the mid-1970s, when the acreage count was around 600. Ray and Tom both went away to college — Stanford and Duke, respectively — and returned to the helm of what is now a 3,000 acre organic operation on a tremendous stretch of land on the border of Washington and Oregon.
Williams Hudson Bay Farm is at the southern end of a small region that grows approximately one quarter of our entire nation's alfalfa seed. Even without the U.S. Department of Agriculture's disastrous approval of Monsanto's Roundup Ready genetically engineered alfalfa seed earlier this year, organic alfalfa seed growers face huge challenges — especially in regions where the surrounding crops are conventional.
Alfalfa, as it turns out, is a sage teacher about the inseparability of each strand in the web of life. It can be really difficult to grow alfalfa seed organically, in part because it's especially vulnerable to some nasty little critters such as aphids and lygus bugs. Like many pests, the lygus and aphids are becoming increasingly resistant to conventional pesticides, leading to increased use of sprays and unintended consequences.
Spraying alfalfa with pesticides also tends to finish off alfalfa's best friend: bees. Alkali bees and Leaf Cutter bees, to be exact — both are native to the area and integral to alfalfa pollination.
Conventional alfalfa growers increasingly are spraying their fields at night when bees are more protected. Trouble is, other local growers — industrial corn farmers, for instance — spray more indiscriminately without regard to a neighbor's alfalfa seed production.
Luckily, the Williams live upwind from neighboring conventional farms and work cooperatively to minimize any migration of pesticides. But no one knows exactly how or when GMO alfalfa seed use will affect the area. In the meantime, the Williams use organic methods of pest control on their organic alfalfa plants, with good results. And they certainly don't wish to disparage conventional growers.
“All farmers appreciate the benefits of healthy soil,” Ray stresses. “But the traditional method of large-scale farming emphasizes volume over quality. We're looking at growing organic as a smart investment in quality, almost like a trust, where you leave the principle intact and live off the interest.” In this case, soil with more micronutrients, trace minerals, and much better biological activity provides the dividends.

“If we're smart and have some luck,” they say, “we think we can be competitive.”
Beyond the luck and the smarts lies the Williams' business acumen. With the commitment to growing organically comes the need to develop strong long-term relationships with customers and distributors.
Williams Hudson Bay Farm is contending with a whole host of issues and hurdles associated with an operation of its size; not just sales but warehousing, distribution and delivery. The Williams are game: they're rolling with it and getting creative. Their business relationships, by necessity and desire, are every bit as diverse as their crops.
They're working with local distilleries to sell different grains, supplying Amy's Kitchen with organic black beans, and selling wheat to Washington-based Fairhaven Organic Flour Mill. Williams Hudson Bay Farm also provides Bob's Red Mill with organic corn and high-protein spring wheat, and in another partnership, they're supplying an Oregon-based café chain with one year's supply — roughly 100,000 pounds — of organic black beans.
The Williams are part of a growing breed of farmers with their eyes on the longer-term, business-specific benefits of organics. They're concerned about rising fuel costs, which can reach $7,000 per week across the whole of their property, as well as the need for all farmers to decrease reliance on fertilizers and petroleum.
Crop diversity also provides some very practical insurance, or as Tom puts it, “not putting too many eggs into one genetically modified basket.”
Despite the longer-term benefits that come with growing organically, it's never an easy road for farmers — big or small. Even with the steeliest of intentions, generations of family farm lineage, land, and enough capital to get going and stay going — farming still is one of the most difficult occupations around.
Tom and Ray Williams have experienced the often steep adjustment of organic certification firsthand. “We refer to that period of time as ‘financial hell' and the ‘worst of both worlds,'” says Ray Williams, with only a trace of a smile, as they describe the transition between conventional growing and going organic.
“Right when you make the organic commitment is the tough part, because you are in that three-year transition when you're unable to get an organic premium yet, while also facing increased production cost and still learning the best ways to make all those changes.”
Because of the costs and resources needed to transition, the Williams were weighing their options. Reluctant to sell any portion of the property, Ray and Tom came to PCC Farmland Trust first, to see if there was some way of keeping their entire farm organic.
With the purchase of a conservation easement on part of the farm, PCC Farmland Trust and NRCS were able to help the Williams keep their entire property organic and protect 300 acres in perpetuity. The sale of the development rights also provided the Williams with capital and leverage to incorporate other sustainable practices and upgrades to infrastructure, farm-wide.
For now, the Williams' organic gamble is working out pretty well. Bob's Red Mill, initially skeptical that a wheat grower in Eastern Washington could reach the same level of quality as their Montana supplier, was impressed by the level of quality of the Williams' hard red spring wheat.
Mike Klicker of Northwest Grain Growers says, “As a farmer, I have been amazed at the quality and yields that the Williams have been able to achieve through their organic practices.”
They're busy working on more upgrades and measures for the future. The plan is to improve and expand manure composting and field application methods, and increase the use of cover crops and crop rotation to enhance soil fertility and health. They're also in the process of infrastructure improvements to their heifer operation, adding solar panels, and increasing efficiency of water and power use.
PCC Farmland Trust is concentrating on the future of organic farming these days, too. We're thinking bigger, working faster, and continuing the emphasis on acquiring strategic agricultural organic conservation easements on as much land as we can.
As opportunities to work with different landowners, farmers, and organizations increase, so does the need to prioritize and concentrate on regions most in need of preservation and protection.
In the case of Williams Hudson Bay Farm, we've created a relationship with some pretty amazing farmers, who share a commitment and vision to flight attendanting this unique stretch of organic farmland in Eastern Washington.

LONDON (Reuters) - Around 390 million people are infected each year with dengue fever - the world's fastest-spreading tropical disease - more than triple the current estimate by the World Health Organization, experts said on Sunday.
The hand of a child, who has been put on drip after showing symptoms of dengue fever, is seen in the pediatric emergency room of a public hospital in Santo Domingo August 13, 2010. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz
The new finding, based on several years of analysis, underscores the growing burden of the mosquito-borne viral disease, which is also called “breakbone fever” because of the severe pain it can cause.
There is as yet no approved vaccine or specific drug to treat dengue, which is not normally fatal but lands many victims in hospital.
Researchers from the University of Oxford and the Wellcome Trust presented their results, along with a detailed map of dengue distribution, in the journal Nature.
Their new figure includes 96 million severe cases and approximately 300 million mild or asymptomatic episodes. That compares with the WHO's the most recent estimate for overall infections of 50-100 million a year,
The high number of relatively mild cases offers little cause for comfort, since it suggests the reservoir of disease is far larger than expected.
What is more, dengue is a disease that hits more than once and people who get it mildly first time are more likely to have a serious episode if bitten again by an infected mosquito.
“The asymptomatic patients, in terms of the future burden of disease, are a very important contributor,” said Jeremy Farrar, director of Oxford University's tropical disease research unit in Vietnam.
Spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, dengue has grown rapidly along with urbanization and globalization because it thrives in tropical mega-cities and is easily spread in goods containing small puddles of water, such as used tires.
Climate change is also making more parts of the planet habitable for the dengue-spreading mosquito.
As a result, half the world's population is now exposed to the disease, mostly in the developing world - but also in parts of southern Europe and the southern United States.
MADEIRA OUTBREAK
Last year Europe experienced its first sustained transmission of dengue fever since the 1920s with around 2,000 people infected in the Portuguese archipelago of Madeira.
Farrar said more such outbreaks were likely in future, since the mosquito was already present in southern Europe and there were increasing numbers of people travelling to and from dengue-infected areas.
The researchers estimated that 70 percent of the world's serious dengue cases were in Asia, with India alone accounting for 34 percent of the total. The Americas - mainly Brazil and Mexico - made up 14 percent, while Africa's dengue burden was nearly as large.
The prevalence of the disease in Africa is worrying, since dengue has not generally been seen as a major problem on the continent. The research team said the impact of disease in Africa was being masked by symptomatically similar illnesses, such as malaria.
Hopes for an effective dengue vaccine suffered a setback last year when an experimental shot from Sanofi proved far less effective than hoped in a mid-stage clinical trial in Thailand.
Further large trials of the Sanofi vaccine - the most advanced in development - are still continuing and scientists have not given up hope that it may yet have a role of play.
A number of other experimental vaccines are also in development, although at a much earlier stage.

From: (Anonymous) Date: September 25th, 2008 03:01 pm (UTC) Has McCain Thrown the Election? (Link) John McCain, to the chagrin of their party, threw a gutterball when they selected that ridiculous creature from Alaska as their running mate. The Senator from Arizona who - for better or worse - can't tell a Baptist from a snake-handler, doesn't know what they have on their hands. Mayor Palin belongs to the "Dominionist" movement, a cult whose "support" for Israel is highly suspect (the Jews must be gathered in Israel for the Coming of Christ, who will then "perfect" them as Christians). We'd likewise be interested in their position vis-a-vis the infamous 13th forgery known as "Revelation 2:9." McCain's obvious ignorance of these matters has alienated a sizable portion of both the Orthodox and Reform Jewish communities. They had a clear opportunity to nominate the young member of congress from Richmond, Eric Cantor, but chose instead to align themselves with the sketchy Governor from Alaska, a lady who once tried to ban the teen classic "I Capture the Castle" from their local library. McCain's choice wasn't simply an insult to Jews, but to thoughtful Gentiles as well. Let's hope that they realize their error before it's too late.

The UN Security Council imposed the no-fly zone over Libya on March 17, along with ordering "all necessary measures" to protect civilians from Muammar Gaddafi's attacks on rebel-held towns.
The 28 NATO ambassadors met on Sunday to decide on further military plans in Libya.
The United States transfers command for a no-fly zone over Libya to NATO, while coalition forces will continue to protect civilian population from attacks by Gaddafi forces.
The military operation in Libya, codenamed Odyssey Dawn, has been conducted so far jointly by 13 states, including the United States, Britain and France.
NATO members decided on Thursday to assume responsibility for the enforcement of a no-fly zone in Libya, but could not agree on taking full command of all military operations in the country.
Meanwhile, leaders of the 27 European Union states on Thursday issued a statement saying the EU stood ready to assist in building a new Libya "in cooperation with the United Nations, the Arab League, the African Union and others."

One of the most important programs that the U.S. Air Force is undertaking is far from glamorous and comes with a funny name: Talon HATE. But this podded system will be vital for eliminating communications barriers between the F-22 and F-15C/D fleets, as well as other weapon systems. It's showing for the first time on the belly of an Operational Test F-15C flying out of Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. Here's how it works.
The F-15 is no stranger when it comes to evolving with the times, and Boeing is doing just that with this new communications and sensor pod system.
Advertisement
The Talon HATE (and by the way, nobody seems to know what that stands for) system includes air-to-air, air-to-ground and satellite data links. Not only will this large pod work as an essential communications bridge and data-fusion center, but it also provides America's F-15C/D Eagle fleet with a serious sensor enhancement via the installation of an Infrared Search and Track system (IRST) at the 17 foot-long, 1,800 pound pod's forward tip.
Advertisement
Talon HATE will work in a very similar way as the Air Force's Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN), which is currently deployed on Air Force E-11 and EQ-4 as well as NASA WB-57 aircraft today, but in a tactical instead of strategic one.
Boeing describes the Talon HATE system as such:
Scheduled to be initially carried by F-15C fighter aircraft, the pod combines information from fourth and fifth-generation fighter aircraft, national sources and joint command and control assets. The system assimilates information in real-time from multiple domains. The data will then be transmitted over a common data-link for use by joint aircraft, ships and ground stations, improving communication and information sharing across the battlefield. The single operational picture formed by Talon HATE is claimed to provide soldiers with a capability to more efficiently engage and defend against ‘next-generation' threats.
Advertisement
Basically it's a fighter-mounted universal translator, data-fusion center, and router that takes various data-links' waveforms and “languages,” and fuses their information into a single common picture. It then rebroadcasts that common picture multiple waveforms and “languages” so that everyone in the battlespace is on the same page and can exploit a much more detailed rendering of where the enemy is and where the good guys are.
This will allow American F-15C/D and other so-called “legacy” fighters, allied aircraft, ships, and ground and command-and-control assets that use MIDS/JTIDS Link 16 data links common to NATO countries to see what the F-22 sees. It does this by receiving and translating the F-22's proprietary and stealthy Intra-flight data link (FIDL) transmissions into data the MIDS/Link 16 data link terminals can display.
Advertisement
This is a very big deal as F-22s are some of the most capable sensor platforms in the world. Their ALR-94 electronic surveillance measures (ESM) and radar warning receiver suite can sniff out the locations of enemy radars and communications, and classify them accordingly. The aircraft's APG-77 AESA radar is also highly capable, especially considering it will likely be operating forward of other non-stealthy enemy forces, peering deep into enemy territory.
The F-22 does not have Link 16 transmission capability like most other combat aircraft because that system was not designed for stealthy aircraft and its omni-direction emissions could give away the F-22's presence. As such, the F-22 can currently receive information via Link 16 compatible broadcasts, but it cannot send them. In other words, an F-22 can see what an F-15C sees sensor-wise, but not the other way around.
The Talon HATE pod will basically masquerade as another F-22, with Raptors beaming back information to it for processing and redistribution on MIDS/Link 16 waveforms. This will allow F-15C/Ds to see the F-22's tactical picture, and other aircraft will be able to as well.
Advertisement
In addition to being a flying data-fusion center and super wireless hot-spot, Talon HATE also features the asupervisorstioned IRST mounted on the tip of its pod. Currently, the Air Force lacks any IRST capability, including the F-22. So this secondary capability gives the F-15C/D Eagle a much-needed set of passive detection eyes.
For context, make sure to read all about how an IRST works and how it changes the air-to-air combat realm in this previous Foxtrot Alpha in-depth feature:
Advertisement
Talon HATE's IRST data will also be integrated into the common picture, so that F-22s can make use of it. This will allow the stealth and fast jets to super-cruise out to a target and engage it without ever turning on their own radars, and thus not emitting any electromagnetic energy that the enemy could spot. Additionally, the pod's IRST can be equally effective when F-22s are not present, giving the F-15C/D fleet a much-needed way for detecting stealthy aircraft and cruise missiles or taking on targets without turning on their powerful radars.
Most importantly, this system will greatly enhance the Eagle-Raptor air dominance team. With only about 125 combat coded F-22s in service, the Air Force will partially rely on the F-15C/D when it comes to air superiority for decades to come. By sharing a common picture, tactics can be better tailored to take advantage of each aircraft's strengths and weaknesses.
Advertisement
For instance, the F-15C/D's new APG-63V3 Active Electronically Scanned Array radar is the most powerful in the world. Being able to search for enemy aircraft deep in enemy airspace, the F-15C/D can data-link its radar picture to the F-22, which can operate far ahead of the Eagle safely. By relying on primarily of the F-15C/D's radar picture, the F-22 can use its radar as little as possible, which will lessen its chances of detection.
As the F-22 moves farther ahead of the battle lines, its passive sensors, which emit no electromagnetic energy that can be detected, can sniff out enemy aircraft formations, and this information can be shared with F-15C/Ds.
Such tactics will allow the F-22 to streak out ahead of the F-15s and club the enemy without them ever knowing they are there, all they would see are F-15C/Ds, with their radars blazing, many miles behind where the Raptors are silently operating. Additionally, once the F-22's missile stocks run dry, they can switch to a scouting role, calling the shots for F-15s that are heavily laden with air-to-air missiles and operating safely behind the F-22's stealthy screen. Boeing is well aware of this potential dichotomy and they are offering upgrades that could see F-15s carrying double the missile load they can today.
Advertisement
What this all amounts to is a maximization of each aircraft's abilities against an enemy threat. By sharing a common situational picture and targeting data, the F-15C/D and F-22 team become much more potent and synergistic, and other aircraft, ships, and ground assets can benefit from this relationship as well. Without Talon HATE's data fusion capabilities, this cannot be achieved.
Advertisement
Even without the F-22's presence, the pod's ability to provide IRST capability and an indigenous active battlefield network capability to the F-15C/D fleet that reaches from the ground up into space is a capability worth pursuing on its own. This is especially true as current BACN equipped aircraft are highly tasked and not meant to be present on the leading edge of the battlefield. This is an especially large problem for anti-access environments, where lumbering support aircraft, like those carrying a BACN system, could be pushed back hundreds of miles from the front lines. And it is in these exact scenarios where having connectivity between F-22s and legacy fighters will be so essential.
Talon HATE represents another step in the Pentagon's attempt to deal with integrating 5th generation stealth fighters with a fleet of older aircraft that will be around for decades to come. This problem will only be exacerbated by the F-35's introduction into service.
Advertisement
Currently there is an initiative underway to try and figure out how its unique and stealthy data link can be rebroadcasted to other less advanced assets. But for now, the most pressing need is to get the F-22 and the Air Force's teen-series fighters, especially the F-15C/D fleet, on the same tactical page, and the Talon HATE pod hopes to do just that.

Two startup companies say they plan to start clinical trials to treat blindness by combining an emerging technology called optogenetics with high-tech goggles that can beam light into the eye.
The companies, GenSight Biologics of Paris and Bionic Sight, a startup out of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, both say a combination of wearable electronics and gene therapy has a chance to restore vision by re-creating the retina's ability to sense light.
Both companies are aiming to help patients with a degenerative eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa, which destroys light-sensing cells in the retina. If the approach works, it could in theory be used to treat any type of retinal disease that involves the loss of these cells, called photoreceptors.
Optogenetics, a form of gene therapy, offers an unconventional but potentially powerful way to bypass damaged photoreceptors. Using the technique, scientists add genetic instructions to a different type of retinal cells, ganglions, so that they become light-sensitive instead.
Working with the Institut de la Vision in Paris, GenSight has developed a pair of goggles containing a camera, a microprocessor, and a digital micromirror that will convert images the camera captures into bright pulses of red light in order to stimulate the modified cells.
When tested in blind monkeys and rats, the technology appeared to restore their ability to see, says GenSight CEO Bernard Gilly, but only a test in human volunteers who are able to describe what they perceive after being treated will be definitive. They expect a human study to start this year.
The companies are also closely tracking results from an initial human test of optogenetics carried out last March in Texas. In a trial being led by RetroSense Therapeutics, recently acquired by Allergan, a blind woman became first person to receive an optogenetic treatment to help restore their vision.
That study has so far enrolled four patients, according to David Birch of the Retina Foundation of the Southwest, where the trial is taking place. Each patient gets an injection into the eye of an engineered virus carrying a gene from algae, which instructs cells to make the light-sensitive protein. The team hasn't yet reported its results, so it's unknown whether the subjects have gotten any of their vision back.
The RetroSense study relies on natural light to activate the cells. That could limit the treatment's effectiveness, because the light-sensing proteins only respond to specific wavelengths of light, and low levels of ambient or natural light may not be bright enough to trigger them.
Richard Masland, an ophthalmology professor at Harvard Medical School and a scientific advisor for RetroSense, says that is why companies are looking into goggles or other “light adaptation machinery” as way to beam light of the right wavelengths and intensity into the eye.
Also pursuing a combination of goggles and optogenetics is Bionic Sight, a startup founded by Sheila Nirenberg, a neuroscientist at Weill Cornell Medical College. The company said in January that it would partner with the gene-therapy company Applied Genetic Technologies to begin clinical trials by 2018.
It's still unclear what sort of vision will result from stimulating the ganglion cells, as these cells normally act to relay nerve impulses and don't receive light directly. Nirenberg says their goggles will convert light into a “neural code,” or a pattern of pre-processed pulses, which will look to the ganglion cells as if they are coming from other cells in the retina.
Daniel Palanker, an ophthalmology professor and director of the Hansen Experimental Physics Laboratory at Stanford University, is skeptical that Nirenberg's neural code will help. That's because there are around 30 types of retinal ganglion cells, some of which respond to light while some respond to motion and some to differences in contrast. No one set of light patterns would be able to communicate with all of them, they say.
Chick-fill-A A worker at a Perdue chicken processing plant had mostly kind things to say about where America's poultry came from.
But there's one food he'll never eat again: chicken nuggets.
In a Reddit Ask Me Anything, the man shared why they don't eat the food.
[NOTE: While the man's identity was verified by Reddit moderators, Business Insider can't independently prove their veracity.]
"It's the meat that can only be gotten by smashing, mashing, mixing, boiling, bleaching, etc the other unwanted parts of the chicken," the man said.
They also described what goes into the nuggets.
"It's all chicken. It's just not all meat. Some of it's skin, a few bones, fat, and whatever meat might still be attached to any of the previous mentioned," they said.
They said their plant provides meat to grocery stores and restaurants.
A group of students is vowing to fight back after legal warnings from Greyhound quashed plans to run buses from London to the GTA.
Lawyer John Nunziata, a former Liberal MP with two kids attending London's Western University, will help them out on a pro-bono basis.
“I know what it's all about for kids to get back and forth,” said Nunziata. “These students have come up with a service that fills a void.”
Bill Mei, 19, and Darren Cole, 18, launched a $25 bus service from Kingston to Toronto for students at Queen's University, which they both attend, over the Thanksgiving weekend. They wanted to expand it to offer a “London Rocket” for the Christmas holidays. Costing $18 to $20, it was due to start Dec. 18.
But a stern letter from lawyers representing Greyhound nixed the idea, warning that Greyhound is the only company licensed to provide scheduled public transportation between London and Toronto.
The principal of a Catholic secondary college in northern New South Wales is urging the school community to embrace two transgender students.
Brother John Hilet, the principal of Trinity Catholic College Lismore, said they felt privileged when two students confided in them that they were experiencing gender identity issues.
They said the students were born female but identified as male and were seeking to wear the designated boys uniform to school.
"I've had students in the past reveal they are same-sex attracted but never with gender identity issues, so I was a bit surprised," Brother John said.
"I was very quickly moved by their level of trust, faith and willingness to come forward and speak with me.
"They were moved at a very deep level and at that point the only response I could think of was to treat them with compassion and reach out and do whatever I could to assist."
Brother John said they sought advice from Lismore Bishop Gregory Homeming and the NSW Catholic Education Commission.
"I did speak with the local Bishop because I knew any move might cause some people to get concerned or upset and they would probably get in touch with them if they wish to express those views," Brother John said.
"His response to me was quite clearly that this is an issue of wellbeing for these students. It is an issue of being caring, compassionate and reaching out and doing what we can to assist. I was very happy that confirmed my feelings."
The students were granted permission to wear the boys uniform, while the school investigated the introduction of a gender neutral uniform option.
Brother John also sent a letter home to parents urging them to support the students:
I will address the other students about difference and respect and will point out that it is essential as a Catholic community we offer our full support to these students and that any comments seen as targeting or bullying these students will not be tolerated. I ask that you also support these students in any conversations you might have with your children.
They said that although the Church may be seen as conservative, the acceptance of transgender students fits within Catholic teachings.
"One of the things I said to the students was that it is a fundamental Catholic teaching that all human beings have an innate dignity that doesn't derive from anything other than the fact we are human and made in the image and likeness of God," Brother John said.
"When Jesus spoke they never taught us to do anything other than love others, so that was the way I expressed it.
"This dignity is inherent, it's not dependent on gender, sexuality, race, creed or anything like that.
"I don't tolerate targeting or bullying of any student, regardless of the cause."
Brother John said they had received 60 emails from parents replying to their letter, which was an unprecedented response.
"Invariably the responses have been incredibly positive, thanking the college for its openness and inclusiveness and overwhelmingly supporting the idea of a gender neutral uniform option," they said.
"The one that touched me most was a mother who indicated one of their children left the school about three years ago for the same reason and at the time didn't feel confident in coming to approach me and talk to me about it. And that was sad."
Welcome to the second part of my recap/tournament report about Grand Prix New York! You can find the first part here.
Before diving into the Grand Prix itself, let me share a related observation about the costs of a three-day weekend. When I judge three days of a Grand Prix, I prefer to avoid having an explicit leadership role on all three days. In my experience, having a leadership role on that third day incurs a much larger incremental cost than the second day of leadership. While I'll happily perform lead roles each day when there's a reason for it, it's not my default preference.
Happily, Grand Prix New York worked out fantastically in that regard. On Friday I was simply part of the sides team, which gave me some time to warm up after a 2-month hiatus from judging events (and, as it turned out, recover from being ill). On Saturday, I was the team lead for one of the two deck checks teams on the main event; on Sunday, I was Head Judge of the Super Sunday Series.
With the stage set, let's talk about Saturday! I was overjoyed to work with Eliana Rabinowitz , Mani Cavalieri , Vincent Roscioli , and Eli Meyer for this event. Rather than going through things round-by-round, I'm going to focus on some of the bigger ideas about how the event was organized and what I learned about my own leadership style. Ready? OK, here we go!
Saturday
On Saturday, I showed up bright and early at 8am met with…half of my team. Wait, what?
One of the recurring issues of organizing a Grand Prix is how to handle the “shift problem.” As GP staffs have gotten larger, splitting the main event judges into two (or more) shifts has become commonplace. Although invaluable for reducing judges' workload, a shift changeover introduces other problems, particularly when it comes to transferring knowledge from the early shift to the late shift.
GP New York tried to solve the shift problem in an interesting way…by not really having shifts. More precisely, judges could work either a regular shift or an extended shift. The extended shift showed up at 8am and stayed until the end of the tournament. The regular shift, meanwhile, was reduced on both ends; they arrived at 8:45am and worked until the end of Round 8.
In particular, all the team leads at GP NY were on the extended shift. A typical early shift/late shift structure means that roughly half of your leadership leaves all at once, resulting in (frequently) very large pivots at that departure time. In contrast, GP NY's structure meant that teams only had to adjust very slightly, as transitioning tasks from one or two people is actually pretty easy.
Ultimately, I think the regular shift/extended shift setup did a great job addressing the knowledge gaps that typically result from switching over from the early shift to the late shift. However, it did so at the cost of knowledge in another area, or more specifically, at the cost of another group of people: the regular shift. By the time the regular-shift judges arrived at 8:45am, preparations for the player's meeting was already well underway, and many teams were actively working on various tasks. At least for me, this made it more challenging than normal to get my team members on the same page and integrate everyone into a single unit.
Overall, though, I was pretty happy with the extended shift setup. One way to address the team integration issue I mentioned would be having all judges (regular and extended shift alike) arrive at the same time. Of course, this would have to be counteracted by having the regular shift leave earlier (perhaps right after Round 8 has begun?), which I think could be acceptable.
The second big picture idea I encountered at GP NY is the challenge of co-leads. Almost every team at GP NY was duplicated (in part, I think, to account for the lack of split shifts, and also to easily enable full-team breaks). Co-leadership opens the door to a variety of issues, from the abstract (e.g. contradictory visions for the team's role) to the very real (e.g. conflicting instructions on how to complete a task, one team thinking/assuming that the other team will take care of something). These problems can be amplified when each of the co-teams is trying to accomplish the same objective, and there isn't actually enough work to go around.
Fortunately, I feel that Deck Checks is a team that's very amenable to co-leadership, in large part because Deck Checks is a very large task that's easily divisible into concrete chunks. (You take this part of the alphabet, you take that one; you two deck check this table, you two deck check that table.) Given that, success basically comes down to ensuring the two co-leads are in sync with each other, rather than stepping on each other's toes. Happily, my co-lead / partner-in-crime was Nicola diPasquale, a Northeast judge whom I've worked with significantly, so this part was easy.
The third issue I want to discuss is the importance of communicating the right level of detail. I'm fortunate enough to have already received reviews from two of my four team members, both of which have been incredibly helpful to me. One theme among both reviews was that I didn't provide enough instruction about how to perform certain tasks, which confused my team members and caused a variety of issues. For example, one judge pointed out that I didn't specify a cut-off time beyond which judges shouldn't swoop a table for a mid-round deck check; another, that I did not provide precise instruction for how judges should mark whether a player's deck list was present or absent on the master list. (This second issue, in particular, led to a lot of wasted time later in the day.)
Frankly, I regard myself as an excellent communicator, so it was wonderfully eye-opening to receive this feedback. Reflecting further, I believe I've realized which elements of my communication led to these issues. Specifically, I skew towards focusing on high-level ideas and avoiding micromanagement. Moreover, I tend to trust (assume) that my team members have similar knowledge and experience to me and to each other, which doesn't really make sense.
Ultimately, this event made me realize some tasks are important enough that the benefits of (over-)communicating expectations outweigh the potential perception of micromanagement — and verifying deck lists is one of them. (Plus, the right communication style can offset or eliminate the risk of team members feeling micromanaged.)
The last topic I'd like to mention is related to team-building. At SCG Providence last year, I tried a “mini-Exemplar” exercise where I asked every judge on staff to sign their SCG “Judge!” token and give it away to a judge who made their event better. After I got my hands on a stack of blank inserts on Friday, I realized I could do something similar for Saturday.
Late in the day, I found each of my team members individually and handed them two blank tokens. I explained that I'd like them to sign, draw, and otherwise personalize their tokens, and give them away to two team members who they had enjoyed working with. When we had our team debrief around the end of round 8 (before the regular shift left), we all went around and explained who we were giving our tokens to and why, which went as wonderfully as I could have imagined. I was pleasantly surprised to receive two tokens myself, from Eli and Vincent:
This exercise also motivated me to be attentive to the great things my team members were doing individually. I ended up personalizing a token for everyone on the team (I made “Tribal Artifact – Bearz Clue” tokens), and I called out a specific thing each person on the team had done well as I gave them their token. I thought this exercise went very well, and I definitely plan on doing it again; the only thing I might do differently is introduce the concept earlier in the day.
Saturday was an incredibly busy and interesting day, so I feel like I could go on and on about the various and sundry other issues we encountered. (Lack of a designated deck check space! Sleep-in special decklist woes! Transparent card sleeves! Pulling Day 2 lists!) But exhaustively categorizing what happened on Saturday was never the purpose of this post. Instead I wanted to focus on a few interesting ideas and problems that have broad applicability to future Grand Prix and other events. I hope I've gotten your problem-solving juices flowing.

The more we see of Mark Gatiss' An Adventure in Space and Time the more exciting it gets. On the weekend we had the Daleks and now we've got some great new set pics of the cast in the TARDIS.
The latest ones feature the Hartnell TARDIS console room recreated in all its glory. We also get to see David Bradley in the First Doctor costume from the original pilot (albeit at a distance).
Also featured in costume are Jamie Glover as William Russell (Ian), Jemma Powell as Jacqueline Hill (Barbara) and Claudia Grant as Carole Ann Ford (Susan).
UPDATE: Nick Briggs has now been confirmed to be voicing the Daleks. They also recorded a cameo as Peter Hawkins, the original voice of the Daleks.
They said on Twitter: “Just did my Peter Hawkins cameo today,” they Tweeted. “Beyond exciting…”
They later added: “Well, you can never tell what will make the edit… But I had a costume and a wig and everything!”

The image spoke a thousand words. Head in hands and sunk to their knees on the Santiago Bernabeu turf, Cristiano Ronaldo cut a forlorn and frustrated figure as Real Madrid were held to a goalless draw at home to Valencia on Sunday.The Portuguese had done everything but score, setting up team-mates for spurned opportunities, forcing Vicente Guaita into a string of saves and even hitting the woodwork. But ultimately, albeit by the finest of margins, they had failed to deliver. And they knew it.But how that changed on Wednesday.Madrid had not lost to city rivals Atletico since 1999 but against a team given a new lease of life since the arrival of Diego Simeone as coach and baying for blood in a vibrant Vicente Calderon, this looked like the most difficult derby in years.Pressed deep and pushed onto their back foot for much of the opening quarter of the game, Madrid looked less than comfortable against an intense and clearly committed Atletico team who were giving as good as they were getting, and more than matching Mourinho's men. All except for one, that is.With 24 minutes played, Madrid won a free kick some 30 yards from goal. Up stepped Cristiano to unleash an unstoppable swerving shot which went one away and then the other before nestling in the bottom right corner with Atletico goalkeepeer Thibaut Courtois motionless on their goal line.It was a moment of unquestionable genius from a man much maligned for their failure to score set pieces in the current campaign. But this one was their third in four matches, the best of the lot and, more importantly, they did it when it mattered most.Ronaldo's sensational strike hit Atletico hard and Madrid looked the better side for the remainder of the half. But a rousing reaction after the interval saw the locals level through Radamel Falaco's header and the Calderon was rocking. So, too, were Real.For the first time in the game, Mourinho was up from their seat on the sidelines as for the fourth occasion in recent weeks, their charges were drawing a game they needed to win and, more significantly, losing their grip on La Liga.Once again, Madrid needed a hero and once again, that hero was Ronaldo. With their team-mates toiling and their coach clearly concerned, the Portuguese stood above all others and thrust their side back into the ascendancy as they advanced down the left channel, cut inside and launched an extraordinary dipping drive which sailed over Courtois' despairing dive and under the crossbar to make it 2-1.This one was perhaps even better than their first and this time, there was no way back for the home side. Ronaldo's brilliance had put paid to an adventurous Atletico outfit, not once but twice, and Real remained in control for the rest of the match.The Portuguese then hit their hat-trick as they converted from the spot after Diego Godin's clumsy challenge on Gonzalo Higuain. That was their 12th Liga treble and the third equalled their own Pichichi record of 40 strikes in a single season, having earlier surpassed the 50-goal milestone for the second term in succession in all competitions. And in 2011-12, Ronaldo has also scored more second-half goals in a solitary campaign than anyone else in the history of Spanish football, taking their total after the interval to 25 to eclipse the previous record of 23 set by Athletic Bilbao legend Telmo Zarra in 1950-51.And they aren't finished yet, either. As the time ticked away, Ronaldo took up possession in midfield, drove forward and freed substitute Jose Callejon on the right to make it 4-1 and round off a performance of epic proportions with their 11th Liga assist of the season.The manner of the display was hugely impressive but the Portuguese produced when it mattered most and that will be most pleasing of all for Mourinho and Madrid. Cristiano has been criticised in the past for failing to show up in crucial matches, and was even jeered at the Bernabeu earlier this season following a poor showing in the 3-1 league defeat to Barcelona, when they missed two clear chances which would perhaps have changed the course of that Clasico clash.On Wednesday, however, as the Liga looked to be slipping from their grasp, Ronaldo stepped up to the plate and celebrated with a veritable feast. Six games still remain and tough tests await for Madrid, not least the tantalising trip to Camp Nou on April 21. But thanks to their masterful Madeiran, they will approach the final fixtures with a four-point lead instead of just two and in this kind of form, even the forthcoming foray to Catalunya will hold less fear.So while Lionel Messi continues to smash records for Barcelona, what Ronaldo is doing for Madrid is simply sensational, too. The 27-year-old could yet emulate the Argentine and surpass 60 strikes this season but, more importantly, they have proven that they are the man for the big occasion. And their performance on Wednesday may just have sealed La Liga.
Mitchell: Slain boy's grandmother calls for ‘War on Guns'
Chicago Police investigate the fatal shooting of 14-year-old Malik Causey about 6 a.m. Sunday, Aug. 21, 2016 at the corner of North and Luna avenues in the Austin Neighborhood on the West Side. | Matthew Hendrickson/Sun-Times
Malik Causey, the 14-year-old boy gunned down outside of their Austin home early Sunday morning, was no angel.
They were a 14-year-old growing up in a neighborhood where guns have become a part of urban gear, like sneakers and pajama bottoms.
More than likely, another teenager pulled the trigger as Malik stood on the corner of North Avenue and Luna before dawn.
“The blood and brains are still on the ground,” said Malik's distraught grandmother, Nicole “Coco” Davis, on Monday.
Malik's death marks a new low for Chicago's street violence.
OPINION
When the dead boy's friends held a candlelight vigil near the spot where Malik fell, gunfire broke out again, wounding an 8-year-old girl and a 36-year-old woman.
“In the 1980s, there was a War on Drugs. Now there has to be a War on Guns. Police are going to have to pull over these young men in these cars with tinted windows, Davis said.
“Police ride right past, instead of pulling over these guys with these big shirts where they are hiding guns. They need to kick in some of these doors. The guns are right here under your nose. How do you get the guns off the street,” they asked rhetorically.
“You ride around and stop these guys.”
But communities such as Austin, which has posted the highest number of gun fatalities so far this year, are caught in what's become a bloody standoff between the Chicago Police Department and the department's critics.
It started last year, first with Mayor Rahm Emanuel blaming the surge in violent crimes on police officers becoming “fetal” because of high-profile incidents.
Then came the release of video that showed police officer Jason Van Dyke shooting Laquan McDonald 16 times.
The police-involved shooting led to rare criminal charges against Van Dyke and forced the ouster of then Supt. Garry McCarthy. Last week, Police Supt. Eddie Johnson called for the firing of seven police officers who allegedly covered up what happened that night.
Additionally, the American Civil Liberties Union found the department's “stop and frisk” policing is disproportionately concentrated in the black community, and that African Americans were subjected to 72 percent of all stops.
Davis is no stranger to the criminal justice system.
They were once involved in the drug trade and spent 14 years in federal prison to pay for it. Since leaving prison, they have tried to save their grandson from making similar mistakes.
“It has been rough. I have run them down and tried to get them off the street. My daughter let them loose, but they are 14-years-old. You don't let them loose,” they said.
Davis said people know who is doing the killing, but won't say anything because they are afraid.
“To stop it, we've got to tell it,” they said.
Them understanding of the events leading up to the shooting sounds like typical kids stuff, except today some kids are armed like soldiers.
“When I got a call that Malik got into it with the little boys across the street, I went looking for them and made them get in the car. They jumped out the car and tried to run and I chased them across the street. I took them to my house,” they said.
Them grandson got up and went back out.
“I got up, and the back door was open and I was right back in the street trying to find him,” they said.
This time Davis wasn't around to wrestle their grandson from the streets.
“Growing up, we would fight with people on the next block and the next day we would be friends. Now they got guns. This is senseless murder,” they said.
“This is a 14-year-old boy we are talking about and nobody has been arrested. Malik didn't get a chance to live and that is so sad.”
We don't treat all of our beliefs the same.
If you learn that the Great Wall of China isn't the only human-made object visible from space, and that, in fact, it's actually very difficult to see the Wall compared to other landmarks, you update your model of reality without much fuss. Some misconceptions we give up readily, replacing them with better information when alerted to our ignorance.
For others constructs though, for your most cherished beliefs about things like climate change or vaccines or Republicans, instead of changing your mind in the face of challenging evidence or compelling counterarguments, you resist. Not only do you fight belief change for some things and not others, but if you successfully deflect such attacks, your challenged beliefs then grow stronger.
The research shows that when a strong-yet-erroneous belief is challenged, yes, you might experience some temporary weakening of your convictions, some softening of your certainty, but most people rebound and not only reassert their original belief at its original strength, but go beyond that and dig in their heels, deepening their resolve over the long run.
Psychologists call this the backfire effect, and this episode is the first of three shows exploring this well-documented and much-studied psychological phenomenon, one that you've likely encountered quite a bit lately.
In this episode, we explore its neurological underpinning as two neuroscientists at the University of Southern California's Brain and Creativity Institute explain how their latest research sheds new light on how the brain reacts when its deepest beliefs are challenged.
By placing subjects in an MRI machine and then asking them to consider counterarguments to their strongly held political beliefs, Jonas Kaplan's and Sarah Gimbel's research, conducted along with neuroscientist Sam Harris, revealed that when people were presented with evidence that alerted them to the possibility that their political beliefs might be incorrect, they reacted with the same brain regions that would come online if they were responding to a physical threat.
“The response in the brain that we see is very similar to what would happen if, say, you were walking through the forest and came across a bear,” explains Gimbel in the episode. “Your brain would have this automatic fight-or-flight [response]…and your body prepares to protect itself.”
According to the researchers, some values are apparently so crucial to your identity, that the brain treats a threat to those ideas as if they were a threat to your very existence.
“Remember that the brain's first and primary job is to protect ourselves,” explains Kaplan in the show. “The brain is basically a big, complicated, sophisticated machine for self-protection, and that extends beyond our physical self, to our psychological self. Once these things become part of our psychological self, I think they are then afforded all the same protections that the brain gives to the body.”
How does the brain take something that is previously neutral and transmutate it into a value that it then protects as if it were flesh and bone? How do neutral, empirical facts about temperature and carbon emissions become politicized? How does an ideological stance on immigration reform become blended with personal identity? We explore those questions and more on this episode of the Are Not So Smart Podcast.

The Backfire Effect
New England Revolution midfielder Lee Nguyen will miss the rest of the 2012 season after undergoing surgery to repair their injured shoulder on Monday. The team said Nguyen is expected to be able to fully participate in training in four months, which means they should be back in time for most, if not all of next season's training camp.
A team release said the surgery was performed in order to repair "chronic instability" in their shoulder. Nguyen played all 90 minutes of the Revolution's most recent game, a 1-1 tie with the New York Red Bulls on Saturday.
Since coming to the Revolution in the waiver draft after being cut by the Vancouver Whitecaps before the start of the season, Nguyen has been one of the team's bright spots. They were the only player to appear in all 30 of their games up until now, contributing five goals and two assists along the way. The highlight of their season came in Week 10 when was named MLS Player of the Week for their two-goal, one-assist performance in a 4-1 win over the Whitecaps.
For more on Nguyen's injury, be sure to check out Revolution blog The Bent Musket.

Alphabet Inc.'s Google has now added personal medical records to the list of things it's willing to remove from search results upon request.
Starting this week, individuals can ask Google to delete from search results “confidential, personal medical records of private people” that have been posted without consent. The quiet move, reported by Bloomberg, adds medical records to the short list of things that Google polices, including revenge porn, sites containing content that violates copyright laws, and those with personal financial information, including credit card numbers.
The policy change appears aptly timed. Earlier this month, a congressionally mandated task force—The Health Care Industry Cybersecurity Task Force report—reported that all aspects of health IT security are in critical condition . And last month, the WannaCry ransomware worm affected 65 hospitals in the UK.
The BBC notes that in May, hackers demanded ransoms from patients who had gone to a Lithuanian clinic for plastic surgery procedures. The hackers had stolen pictures and other health information.
In the past, health records have also been posted online accidentally, Bloomberg notes. A pathology lab in India inadvertently published the health records of 43,000 patients in December, for instance. Those records include sensitive information, including names and HIV blood tests.
ANALYSIS: Two fossil fuel power plants in Huntly signalled for closure are to remain open, Genesis Energy has revealed.
Instead, they will have their life extended.
The move follows agreements reached with other power companies to share the cost of keeping the two plants open.
Photo: GENESIS ENERGY
The Huntly units burn gas and coal, and have a capacity of 500 megawatts.
Genesis Energy announced last year that it would shut down the units at the end of 2018.
This was applauded by environmentalists who saw it as a step towards making New Zealand electricity greener.
Genesis Energy had cited an economic rationale, saying the power plants' fixed costs were too high and their usage too low to be economically sustainable.
The closure alarmed other companies, which feared electricity could run short if the Huntly plants were unavailable as a back-up.
Their worries about energy security were echoed in reports by Transpower. Multi party negotiations then followed and an agreement has now been reached.
Today, Genesis Energy announced the plants will operate until December 2022.
It said it had entered into contracts with other electricity generators, covering operational and capital costs of the units.
Genesis says the time to develop new generation, along with the uncertainty over the future of the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter in Southland, means Huntly needs to stay open for longer.
The exact details of the contracts remain uncertain at this stage, but will almost certainly involve payments from other companies to Genesis to meet the costs of keeping Huntly open.
These would be done with so-called swaps - in which companies buy each other's electricity supply for long periods, agreed in advance.
The price of the swaps would be tilted slightly in favour of Genesis to offset its costs.
The main reason for this deal is that alternative projects such as windfarms are unaffordable to build as long as uncertainty persists over Tiwai Point. This uses a seventh of New Zealand's power and could shut down as soon as 2018.
If that happened, New Zealand would be flooded with cheap electricity and any new plant would plunge into the red.
In recent years, we have described the Bureau of Economics' approach to analyzing product markets and competitive effects in mergers of hospitals and health care providers.22 These analyses mostly focus on price; but in health care markets, the quality of patient care is also an important part of the complete competitive analysis. Clearly, the quality of care that is received by patients has a large impact on welfare in the health care sector. It has become common for merging health care providers to assert that the merger will improve quality. In this year's discussion, we briefly describe the general framework underlying our analysis of efficiency justifications and quality improvement claims in health care provider mergers.
We then discuss in greater detail our efficiencies analysis in the FTC's recent challenge of the acquisition of the Saltzer Medical Group by St. Luke's Health System.23 The analysis of the St Luke's case is extremely important because the merging parties' defense of the transaction was that it was necessary to achieve integrated care, as promoted by the Affordable Care Act (ACA),24 including a move away from the traditional fee-for-service care model to a value-based care model. Since the District Court ruled that the transaction was anticompetitive, the parties, and many commentators, have complained that the federal government is providing conflicting signals to health care providers: encouraging greater coordination of patient care through the ACA, yet enforcing antitrust laws against firms' efforts to improve care coordination through consolidation. We hope that this discussion demonstrates that there need to be no conflict between health care reform and competition law, and that both are necessary to lower health care costs and improve patient care.25
The average American's daily hygiene ritual would seem unusual—nay, obsessive—to our forebears a hundred years ago. From mouthwash to deodorant, most of our hygiene products were invented in the past century. To sell them, the advertising industry had to create pseudoscientific maladies like "bad breath" and "body odor."
Americans had to be convinced their breath was rotten and theirs armpits stank. It did not happen by accident. "Advertising and toilet soap grew up together," says Katherine Ashenburg, author of The Dirt on Clean. As advertising exploded in the early 20th century, so did our obsession with personal hygiene.

Even our very notion of "soap" changed. Until the mid-19th century, "soap" meant laundry soap, the caustic stuff used for scrubbing soiled linens and clothes. A kinder, gentler alternative was invented for cleaning the body, and it had to be called "toilet soap" to distinguish from the unrefined stuff. Today, "toilet soap" is a superfluous designation. Toilet soap is simply soap.
Advertisers did not invent a notion of cleanliness out of a vacuum, but they did cannily tap into anxieties wrought by social upheavals in the early 20th century. As people moved from farm to factory to office, working spaces became where they spent all day with strangers in closer and closer quarters. Men and women began to work together. Women, especially, were a target of ads playing on the theme, "Often a bridesmaid, never a bride."

And to be sure, advances in science and technology played a role, too. Plumbing made the weekly ritual of a Saturday night, pre-Sabbath bath easy to repeat every night of the week. Public health campaigns born out of a better understanding of germ theory trumpeted cleanliness.
Amidst all this, a new affliction called halitosis descended upon American. You know about it thanks to Listerine, the orchestrator of what maybe be one of the most successful advertising campaigns in history.

How Listerine Made Americans Terrified of Bad Breath
There's a reason why Listerine is so nasty—it wasn't originally meant to go in your mouth. When Joseph Lawrence invented the alcohol-based liquid in 1879, they created it as disinfectant for surgery. And for the first several decades of Listerine's existence, it was only available to doctors.

In 1914, however, the brander's owners, Lambert Pharmacal, Company decided to introduce Listerine to a wider audience. The liquid was then sold as a general disinfectant with a whole range of uses from treating dandruff to insect bites, but sales were nothing spectacular. During a brainstorming session, Gerard Lambert dragged in a chemist at the company, who happened to drop a little-known term "halitosis." Here's what happened in Lambert's own words.
I asked them if Listerine was good for bad breath. They excused themselves for a moment and came back with a big book of newspaper clippings. They sat in a chair and I stood looking over their shoulder. They thumbed through the immense book. "Here it is, Gerard. It says in this clipping from the British Lancet that in cases of halitosis . . ." I interrupted, "What is halitosis?" "Oh," they said, "that is the medical term for bad breath." [The chemist] never knew what had hit him. I bustled the poor old fellow out of the room. "There," I said," is something to hang our hat on."

Halitosis lent Listerine the authoritative air for a fantastically successful advertising campaign, creating a market for the novel product of mouthwash. In an early version of A/B testing, coupons were sent out accompanying old and new-style Listerine ads. The halitosis ads did four times as well. Sales climbed 33 percent in just the first month.
From then on, Listerine took out a parade of advertisements insinuating that bad breath was pervasive, but people were simply too polite to tell you. Bad breath I mean halitosis was secretly holding you back, and only Listerine could fix it.

Lambert would become the third largest advertiser in major American magazines, according to Vincent Vinikas in Soft Soap, Hard Sell. The company created the demand for a product Americans did not know they wanted, let alone needed. And it's not just bad breath Americans came to fear.
The Ad Man Who Launched Their Career With Antiperspirant

James Webb Young, one of the legendary ad men of the 20th century, was still a young copywriter when they got the Odorono account. Odorono was, well, not great. As Sarah Everts describes in a fascinating piece in Smithsonian Magazine, the antiperspirant's acid solution had a nasty habit of eating through clothes, including one woman's wedding dress.
A bigger problem, though, was a pervasive belief that blocking sweat was bad for health. To counter that, Young's first advertisements emphasized Odorono's origins as a formula developed by a doctor. But they ran into an even bigger problem, which is that a survey revealed two-thirds of women didn't feel like they needed to use antiperspirant. And here, Young found their true target for selling Odorono: embarrassment.

The 1919 ad in the Ladies Home Journal (above) hit a nerve. Two hundred angry subscribers supposedly canceled their subscriptions because they were so insulted by the ad. But it also worked. Sales for Odorono doubled in the next year. Competitors like Mum (below) jumped on the "whisper copy" train, insinuating what people were supposedly too polite to say directly.

The Cleanliness Institute
Early on, the soapmakers also realized that advertising could only do so much to differentiate brands—what they really needed to do was band together to convince Americans that cleanliness was paramount. Thus, the Association of American Soap and Glycerine Producers established the friendlier sounding Cleanliness Institute in 1927. The institute could promote keeping clean and, by extension, soap consumption.

The industry cannily made school children its primary target. "No approach could better meet the industry's ends than inculcating every youth in American to a tale of soap-and-water. Once habituated to regular and frequent consumption, the children could guarantee a market for years to come," writes Vincent Vinikas in an excellent chapter on the institute from their book Soft Soap, Hard Sell.
As one of its first major activities, the institute conducted a study of the hygiene habits of students in 145 schools. They found, by their own standards much room for improvement. Only 57 percent of the schools had soap. "The object should be not merely to make children clean but to make them love to be clean," read an institute report.
So the institute set about correcting the course with a flurry of storybooks, teacher's guides, and and posters. Teachers were to write letters to parents about the cleanliness. In one case, the institute reported on a school where students were given "wash tickets" after washing their hands. Only by presenting these tickets could they even enter the school cafeteria.

The methods may read as heavy-handed today, but the habits promoted by the Cleanliness Institute will be utterly familiar. "The trade association wanted Americans to to wash quite unwittingly after toilet, to wash without thought before eating, to jump into the tub as automatically as one might awake each new day," writes Vinikas.

That vision is not far from today's reality. If anything, the grooming products deemed essential for proper hygiene have only proliferated. Even a quick stroll through the drugstore—past what seems like infinite varieties of shampoo and deodorant and whatever new product just rolled out of the factories—can tell you that.

Kenji Fujimoto (藤本 健二, Fujimoto Kenji, born 1947) is the pen name of a Japanese chef who claimed that they were former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il's personal sushi chef from 1988 to 2001. Fujimoto published a memoir in 2003 entitled I was Kim Jong-il's Cook, detailing many of their experiences with Kim Jong-il. Many people doubted the veracity of their claim. However, Fujimoto correctly predicted that Kim Jong-un (who was relatively unknown at that time) would be appointed as their father's successor as Supreme Leader instead of Kim Jong-nam, which was contrary to the prevailing consensus of experts on North Korean politics. Fujimoto's prediction proved true in December 2011.
A classified U.S. diplomatic cable from Tokyo, leaked by WikiLeaks, revealed that they were the best and often the sole source of North Korean information for the Japanese spy agency.[1]
Arrival in North Korea [ edit ]
Fujimoto first visited North Korea in 1982.[2] Six years later, they became Jong-il's personal sushi chef on a salary of £45,000 a year (equivalent to £119,000 in 2018),[3] and was given two Mercedes cars.[4] Soon after, they became Jong-il's companion; both men, according to Kenji, went shooting, riding and water-skiing together. They confirmed a widely believed rumour that Jong-il had a serious fall from their horse in 1992, breaking their collar bone and lying unconscious for several hours.[2]
Claims [ edit ]
Fujimoto states that Kim Jong-il had a taste for "live fish"[5][6] and expensive alcohol such as French wines and brandies, particularly Hennessy cognac,[7] while claiming that both Jong-il and their third son, Kim Jong-un, "both like shark fin soup three times a week".[8] According to Fujimoto, they would travel the world for Kim Jong-il, all expenses paid, purchasing Chinese melons, Czech beer, Uzbek caviar, Thai papayas and Danish pork.[9] On one occasion, an envoy was sent to China to retrieve some McDonald's hamburgers.[10] Kim's wine cellar is filled with 10,000 bottles, they said,[11] and the banquets that Kim holds have lasted for four days.[12] Fujimoto also said there is an institute based in Pyongyang staffed by 200 individuals devoted entirely to Kim Jong-il's diet, ensuring they eat the best and most healthy foods.[13]
They also spoke of "Kim's Joy Division": young women chosen to dance for, sing for and bathe Kim, who would be instructed to undress but not allowed to be touched by other guests, saying it amounted to "theft".[14] They said that Kim liked disco music, and preferred watching others dance, rather than dancing himself.[15] Fujimoto said they themselves later married one of the women at a drunken wedding,[4] where they passed out on cognac and woke to find their pubic hair shaved.[16]
They have described Kim Jong-il as having a "violent temper".[12] In an interview on Japanese commercial television, they say that Kim Jong-un, then the heir apparent of Jong-il, "knows how to be angry and how to praise. They have the ability to lead people... also they love basketball, roller-blading, snowboarding and skiing... I watched them play golf once and they reminded me of a top Japanese professional."[8] Fujimoto says they were handed a photo of Jong-un when they were younger, adding they refused to share recent photos with him. They were told not to make the photo public; however, in February 2009, they released the photo.[17] Jong-il's other son, Kim Jong-chul, was said by Jong-il to be "too feminine and unfit for leadership".[18]
In addition to these claims, Fujimoto spoke of a nuclear accident in 1995 at an unnamed plant, where several workers became ill and lost their teeth,[2] and that Kim Jong-il was severely affected by their father's death in 1994, and was even found with a gun at one point.[2] They were also reported to have asked Fujimoto in 1989 what they thought about nuclear weapons.[2]
Escape from North Korea [ edit ]
Fujimoto has stated that they thought about leaving for Japan on several occasions while in North Korea. On a visit to Japan in 1996, they were arrested after carrying a fake Dominican Republic passport.[2] In March 2001, shortly before they defected via China to Japan for fear they were being spied upon,[2] they said they presented a videotape to Kim Jong-il of a sea urchin dish from a Japanese television show which they promised they would cook for him. Fujimoto said they would travel to Hokkaido to buy some sea urchin, to which Kim replied "That's a great idea. Go for it!"[19] On travelling to Japan, Fujimoto did not return to North Korea, and started living in hiding, after allegedly being targeted by North Korean agents.[3] They appeared on Japanese television with their face obscured as a "Kim Jong-il expert".[19] After publishing their memoir, I was Kim Jong-il's Cook, they wore a bullet-resistant vest.
Return to North Korea [ edit ]
In June 2012, Fujimoto received an invitation from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and on July 21, 2012, flew to Pyongyang via Beijing.[20] During their visit, they reportedly visited Kim Jong-un and their wife, and mentioned that Pyongyang had changed significantly over the last decade.[21]
Books [ edit ]
Fujimoto has written three books: Kim's Chef, Kim's Private Life and The Honorable General Who Loved Nuclear Weapons and Girls.[15] Their 2003 memoir I was Kim Jong-il's Cook (also known as Kim's Chef) was a best-seller in Japan.[3]

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg could be in hot water over a “Draw Muhammad” contest hosted on the site last month.  They are being investigated by Pakistani authorities under a section of the penal code that makes blasphemy against Muhammad punishable by death.
The contest, called “Everybody Draws Muhammad Day,” was sparked by the censorship of a South Park episode which depicted the Muslim figure and resulted in death threats against the show's creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. It was designed as a protest against the limitation of free speech and called for users to create a drawing representing Muhammad. What began as a joke in the United States, however, was not found funny in Pakistan where depictions of Muhammad are strictly prohibited. Pakistan banned Facebook for all of its 45 million users until the site agreed to block the contest page in that country. Once the page was blocked the ban was lifted.
A lawyer in Pakistan, Muhammad Azhar Siddique filed an application for a First Information Report claiming that the owners of Facebook had committed a “heinous and serious” crime under Section 295-C of the Pakistani Penal Code. That section reads: “use of derogatory remark etc, in respect of the Holy Prophet, whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representation, or by any imputation, innuendo, or insinuation, directly or indirectly, defiles the sacred name of the Hold Prophet Muhammed (Peace Be Upon Him) shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable for fine.” To be clear, a First Information Report simply launches a criminal investigation, and charges have not yet been formally filed. Currently under investigation by the Deputy Attorney General are not only Zuckerberg but also their fellow co-founders Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes, and the German woman who initiated the “Draw Muhammed” contest. Pakistan's United Nations representative has also asked to escalate the issue in the UN General Assembly.
Under current Virginia legislation, a marijuana possession charge can lead to serious repercussions.
Right now, possession of less than half an ounce of pot could land a person jail time for 30 days. Under a potential reform to that law, that charge would result in a fine instead.
Officials want public opinion on the idea of lightening the existing punishment.
Virginia lawmakers are requesting residents to provide input on marijuana reform until August 25. They can email in their opinion on how the state should proceed with marijuana reform to vsccinfo@vscc.virginia.gov
The urge for public recommendation stems from state Republican Majority Leader Thomas Norment, Jr. supporting a decriminalization study that will be presented to the general assembly.
National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), a Virginia based group in support of legalization reform, reacted positively to the request for the public's opinion.
"When I was faced with a second round of cancer and potentially a third … I wanted to be sure that oncology patients in Virginia had the access to the same types of therapy that millions of Americans have,” said Jenn Michelle Pedini, NORML Executive Director.
"The time is now to be vocal about the issue: should it be a civil fine or a criminal penalty that will affect a person for the rest of their life,” said Jess Vegas, chapter director for NORML in Jefferson Area.
Those on the other side of this issue argue that changes to current legislation could ease access for minors.
The findings from the decriminalization study will be presented to the General Assembly on October 5.
Individuals can also reach out to local or state representatives to give feedback about the potential reform.
No company likes to admit it made a mistake, and Facebook is feistier than most. But Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has essentially admitted that Russian interests exploited the social-media giant to interfere in last year's US elections.
Zuckerberg didn't explicitly say Facebook screwed up. But in a short video broadcast on their Facebook page Thursday afternoon, they made indirect references to “what happened here,” vowing that “we can do more” and saying “we are in a new world. It's a new challenge for internet companies having to deal with nation-states trying to interfere with elections.”
The full extent of Russia's involvement in last year's elections still isn't fully known, which is one reason special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating. But Russian interests, among other things, purchased ads on Facebook that generally praised Donald Trump—the Kremlin's preferred candidate—while deriding their opponent, Hillary Clinton. In general, it's illegal for foreign interests to run ads in the United States on behalf of political candidates.
[Related: Maybe Facebook and Twitter should be regulated like TV.]
Russian operatives also appear to have created millions of fake accounts on both Facebook and Twitter, meant to fill social media with pro-Trump propaganda. That's not necessarily illegal, but it does tarnish the trustworthiness of the two platforms and raise questions about whether they are tacit contributors in the possible tilting of an election.
Mueller has already obtained data from Facebook on the Russian ads and related matters, presumably using subpoena power. Congressional committees, also investigating Russian meddling in the election, have also asked for information. Facebook initially refused. But Zuckerberg now says he'll give Congress much or all of the information Mueller has, including 3,000 Russian ads that ran on the platform last year. (That means they'll probably leak soon to the press.)
Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg. (Getty/AFP/Archivos | JUSTIN SULLIVAN) More
Zuckerberg shrewdly realized that Facebook is facing a new kind of challenge in Washington, with prominent politicians such as Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat who's the ranking minority member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, saying the company is withholding information. Congressional committees are likely to summon Zuckerberg or other Facebook execs to testify, and it's quite possible Congress could propose new legislation to regulate foreign activity on social media, since Facebook seemed incapable of policing such problems itself last year.
Zuckerberg announced nine new initiatives that they undoubtedly hope will preempt new regulations and mend relationships with Washington. In general, they amount to beefing up Facebook's own investigations of suspect activity and focusing on election integrity in particular. One specific change will be requiring every paid political ad to include disclosure about who paid for it, with links to that party's Facebook page, if there is one. That will apply in foreign elections, as well.
Will it work? The answer probably depends on what Mueller's investigation turns up — and how deep the Russians really burrowed into Facebook, Twitter and other social-media networks. Zuckerberg themselves admitted that “we may find more” as the hunt continues for Russian fingerprints.
Election integrity is arguably more serious than other issues Facebook has encountered, such as privacy and antitrust concerns. Policymakers may not be willing to trust Facebook and impose new rules instead. The company, after all, has said “trust us” before, and at the moment, we trust it less.

A disabled teenager killed themselves on the same day that the payday loans company Wonga cleared out their bank account, it has been revealed.
An inquest heard that Kane Sparham-Price, 18, from Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, had “numerous problems including those connected with their mental health” and spent much of their life in foster care and care homes.
If payday lender Wonga collapses what will it mean for customers? Read more
The teenager took out loans through Wonga's website after they turned 18 and left local authority care. They were found dead in February 2013 after the loans company took payments for their debts under the terms they had signed up to, leaving their bank account empty.
There is no suggestion that Wonga acted unlawfully or was aware it had left Sparham-Price penniless, but a coroner's report, which has recently been unearthed, called for a change to payday loan rules to prevent similar deaths in the future.
John Pollard, the senior coroner for south Manchester, said in the report, which was uncovered by Disability News Service last week: “He was left with no money in their account and no means of borrowing any more. Whilst I accept that the various payday lenders are legally entitled to ‘clear out' someone's bank account if money is owing to them, it struck me that there ought to be a statutory minimum amount which MUST be left in an account (say £10) to avoid absolute destitution; and as I understand you set and regulate the rules, you might look at this with a view to preventing further deaths.”
The report was sent to the Financial Conduct Authority 12 months ago. In the FCA's response last October, the chief executive, Martin Wheatley, said introducing such changes would be “undesirable” because it would include the potential for breaching a customer's privacy, as well as the possibility of incurring extra bank charges if a payment was refused.
Wheatley added, however, that the FCA had already taken action to restrict continuous payment authorities (CPAs) as part of new rules on payday loans. This meant that lenders such as Wonga were no longer allowed to make more than two attempts to use a CPA to take a repayment or use a CPA to take a part-payment, as in the case of Sparham-Price.
They said: “We found that some lenders were using CPAs as a debt collection method and that some consumers were left in significant difficulties and unable to pay for essentials such as food and heating.
“This restriction should mitigate the likelihood of lenders ‘clearing out' a consumer's account, as payment will only be taken where the amount can be taken in full.”
In a statement, Wonga said: “We were sorry to hear of the tragic death of Mr Sparham-Price. We take our responsibilities to our customers very seriously and we have strict lending criteria in place.
“We conducted a full review of this case at the time to confirm we acted according to regulatory guidelines and to continue to improve our engagement with customers.”
Wonga agreed with the FCA in October to make “significant” changes to its business because it was “not taking adequate steps to assess customers' ability to meet repayments in a sustainable manner”. This meant that hundreds of thousands of Wonga customers subsequently had their outstanding loans written off.

Back in 1983, Boston University's public relations folks decided to have a little fun with April Fools'. They called Joseph Boskin, a professor emeritus of history with a particular fondness for the medieval period, and asked if they could be pitched as an expert on the history of April Fools' Day.
They agreed and then didn't give it much more thought, according to this article in BU Today. But the university's PR folks did spread the word, and as it turned out, a reporter for the Associated Press wanted to speak to him. Boskin, who was in California at the time, returned the reporter's call in New York. The 2009 BU Today article quoted Boskin as saying:
“I said, ‘I don't know anything about the holiday, and I really can't be of help to you,' ” Boskin recalls. “The reporter said, ‘Don't be so modest.' When the reporter kept pushing, Boskin says, “I created a story.”
The story they created revolved around a friend's love for kugel, a Jewish noodle pudding and a court jester named Kugel. Boskin spinned a story about how, during the reign of ancient Roman Emperor Constantine, group of court jesters told them they could run their empire more efficiently than they were and they agreed to allow Kugel to rule for a day as king. Being a jester, Kugel declared that on that day forward each year, people would celebrate it as a day of absurdity. The AP story quoted Boskin as saying: “In a way, it was a very serious day. In those times fools were really wise men. It was the role of jesters to put things in perspective with humor.”
In this 2009 story, BU Today quoted Boskin as saying:
“Since I was calling New York, where kugel is famous, and it was April Fools' Day, I figured they would catch on,” Boskin laughs. “Instead, they asked how to spell kugel.” As they were telling the outlandish story, they kept expecting the reporter to wise up to what they were doing, but all they heard was the clatter of a typewriter on the other end of the phone.
The story was published by the AP, and other news outlets called them for details about King Kugel. When the AP realized they had been duped, an irate editor called Boskin and accused them of ruining the life of a young reporter. Actually, they didn't; the reporter, Fred Bayles, had a long journalism career and is an associate professor of journalism at Boston University.
AP ran a correction, and Boskin used the story to remind their students that they should always question whatever they hear. Boskin was quoted as saying by BU Today:
The AP always, always checks on stories, and for some reason this one fell through the cracks. It was their fault for not checking the story, and I embarrassed them. But I mean, really — kugel? What reporter from New York doesn't know what that is?
This sounds like an April Fool's joke, doesn't it?
It's not. It really happened.

Nearly 80 years ago, on July 2, 1937, Amelia Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan took off from Lae, New Guinea, in a Lockheed Electra 10E on one of the last legs of their around-the-world flight. They were aiming for tiny Howland Island just north of the equator. They couldn't find it, and despite many attempts, no one has been able to find them.
The U.S. Coast Guard and Navy scoured the area by ship and plane for two weeks. George Putnam, Earhart's husband, enlisted civilian mariners to continue the hunt. Over the years, enthusiasts have looked for signs of Earhart or their plane in the Marshall Islands, on Saipan, and deep underwater.
But the mystery of what happened to Amelia Earhart may be as close as it's ever been to being solved. An expedition organized by the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) sets sail on June 24 from Fiji. On board will be a team that's proved astonishingly adept at locating human remains—specially trained forensic dogs.
The expedition's destination is Nikumaroro, an uninhabited island some 1,000 miles north of Fiji. The members of TIGHAR have devoted the last three decades to testing what they call the Nikumaroro hypothesis—that when Earhart and Noonan couldn't find Howland, they landed on Nikumaroro.
WHERE IS AMELIA EARHART? On July 2, 1937, Amelia Earhart and their navigator, Fred Noonan, took off from Lae, Papua New Guinea, bound for Howland Island, one of the last stops on their 29,000-mile flight around the world.

TIGHAR has launched 12 missions in search of Earhart. “This expedition is less of a shot in the dark than any expedition we've had,” says Tom King, TIGHAR'S senior archaeologist.
The coral atoll is 350 nautical miles southwest of Howland, on the line of position (157 NW 337 SE) that Earhart identified in their last confirmed radio message. Up the northwest line, there's nothing but empty ocean for thousands of miles. To the southeast are the Phoenix Islands, which include Nikumaroro. “If you don't know where you are,” says Ric Gillespie, the executive director of TIGHAR, “that's the logical direction to head.”
Nikumaroro, then called Gardner Island, has a reef flat where Earhart could have landed the Electra during low tide. More intriguingly, when the island was temporarily colonized in 1940, during the last gasp of the British Empire, 13 bones were discovered, shipped to Fiji, measured—and subsequently lost. The colonial administrator suspected they might be Earhart's, and the TIGHAR researchers suspect they know the site where the bones were found.
“There's real potential for there to be more bones there,” says King. “There are 193 bones unaccounted for.”

That's where the dogs come in. Human remains detection dogs from the Institute for Canine Forensics (ICF) have nosed out burial sites as deep as nine feet and as old as 1,500 years. “No other technology is more sophisticated than the dogs,” says Fred Hiebert, archaeologist in residence at the National Geographic Society, which is sponsoring the canines. “They have a higher rate of success identifying things than ground-penetrating radar.”
But this mission will be a challenge. The dogs—four border collies named Berkeley, Piper, Marcy, and Kayle—will have to endure a trans-Pacific flight as well as a nearly week-long ocean voyage to get to Nikumaroro.
The island itself is hot, covered in dense vegetation, and teeming with crabs, including coconut crabs, the world's largest land arthropod. “The dogs are not effective when the ground temperature is over 80 degrees,” says Lynne Angeloro, vice president of ICF and Berkeley's handler. But they think they'll be able to work through and around the underbrush. “I have no doubt they'll be able to at least get scents.”
“The crabs are our friends,” says Hiebert. Voracious scavengers, they drag booty—the remains of coconuts, say, or rats—back to their burrows. If their stash includes human bones, “that would provide the environment to retain those decomposition smells.”
The dogs alert on the scent of human bones, sitting or lying down with their paws on either side of the spot where the smell is most intense. But they can't pinpoint the exact location of a body. “Scent, when it's underground, comes up at the place of the least resistance,” says Angeloro. That could be good distance from the actual bones, so once a dog identifies a spot, the archaeologists will excavate a wide area around it.
If TIGHAR's team of dogs and archaeologists unearths bones, the remains will be shipped back to the United States for DNA analysis. Earhart has a living relative who could serve as a comparison. Noonan, unfortunately, does not.
Gillespie is skeptical that bones will be found and that the analysis will work. “The rats chew up bones,” they say. “DNA, in general, likes cold and dark. You're just not going to get a lot of cold and dark on Nikumaroro.”
Hiebert is more optimistic. “If the dogs don't find anything, we'll have to think about what that means,” they say. Maybe the vegetation was too thick for them. Maybe the bones have been completely bleached. Maybe they were never there at all.
“But if the dogs are successful,” they say, “it will be the discovery of a lifetime.”
WASHINGTON, DC, January 25, 2013 (ENS) – All of the fuel onboard a U.S. Navy minesweeper grounded in the Philippines' Tubbataha Reefs Natural Marine Park was removed today without a spill, but the incident has prompted calls for better protection of the pristine area.
The 15,000 gallons of fuel carried by the USS Guardian was safely transferred to another vessel during two days of controlled de-fueling that began Thursday.
Based at Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan, the Guardian grounded early in the morning of January 17 in Tubbataha Reefs Natural Marine Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site in the Sulu Sea of the Philippines.
Initial efforts to free the 68-meter long ship on high tide were not successful and the Guardian remains stuck on the reef 80 miles east-southeast of Palawan Island.
The 80 crewmembers were evacuated safely; now there is no one onboard, and the Navy says there are “no traces of an oil slick in the area” although the vessel is taking on water.
But conservationists warn that large areas of the pristine corals have been destroyed as the ship's hull grinds on the reef, while monsoon winds are making it difficult to dislodge the vessel.
“Hundreds of meters of once-pristine reef have already been flattened,” said the World Wide Fund for Nature Philippines.
The Philippines government was promptly informed of the incident and is being updated regularly by U.S. officials.
The U.S. 7th Fleet Commander expressed regret over the grounding. “As a protector of the sea and a sailor myself, I greatly regret any damage this incident has caused to the Tubbataha Reef,” said Vice Adm. Scott Swift.
“We know the significance of the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park and its importance as a World Heritage Site. Its protection is vital, and we take seriously our obligations to protect and preserve the maritime environment,” said Swift.
When the Guardian is recovered by the U.S. Navy, Swift said the U.S. government will continue to work with the Philippines government to assess the extent of the damage to the reef and the surrounding marine environment caused by the grounding.
There could have been even more fuel aboard the grounded vessel. Prior to leaving a port visit in Subic Bay, Guardian canceled a scheduled fuel stop to Puerto Princesa.
Guardian departed Olongapo City en route to Indonesia and was transiting the Sulu Sea when it ran up on the reef.
The U.S. Navy is undertaking an investigation to determine the exact cause of the grounding.
This investigation will include information on faulty digital navigation chart data that misplaced the location of Tubbataha Reef.
On January 18, the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, NGA, provided the Navy with preliminary findings of a review on Digital Nautical Charts that contain inaccurate navigation data and may have been a factor in the Guardian grounding.
Since Digital Nautical Chart mapping is used for safe navigation by other U.S. Navy ships, Navigator of the Navy Rear Adm. Jonathan White on Friday released precautionary guidance to all Fleet and ship commanders.
White's message states, “initial review of navigation data indicates an error in the location of Tubbataha Reef” on the digital map.
NGA personnel have reviewed data from more than 150,000 square nautical miles in the surrounding area and found no additional errors.
On October 31, 2005, the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior ran aground on Tubbataha Reef, damaging some 1000 square feet of the reef, for which they paid a fine of about $7000. Greenpeace blamed the accident on inaccurate charts.
WWF calls the reef “a food factory for the Sulu Sea” that continuously seeds the waters of Palawan and the West Visayan isles with fish and invertebrate spawn.
Tubbataha hosts some 600 species of fish, 360 species of corals, 14 species of sharks, 12 species of dolphins and whales as well as nesting populations of seabirds and marine turtles.
Tubbataha is a priority conservation area of WWF and is one of the Coral Triangle region's most important marine areas.
The conservation history of Tubbataha spans 25 years. It became the country's first marine protected area in 1988 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993.
In 2009, the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park Act became law to provide more permanent management structures, fiscal autonomy, and steeper penalties for violating the rules of the park, which is under protective management by the Philippines Department of National Defense.
WWF Philippines says several sanctions can be imposed on the ship for violating the Tubbataha Reef Natural Park Act: unauthorized entry, damages to the reef, destroying and disturbing resources and non-payment of conservation fees.

Transgender Athlete Competes For Olympic Spot
Enlarge this image toggle caption Al Tielemans/Sports Illustrated Al Tielemans/Sports Illustrated
A central question of gender and sports is facing officials as they prepare for London's Summer Olympics: In a system that segregates athletic competition by sex for reasons of fairness, where do transgender athletes fit?
Take, for example, Keelin Godsey, the first openly transgender contender for the U.S. Olympic team. Last month, Godsey qualified for the women's track and field Olympic trials in the hammer throw.
Godsey was born female, identifies as male, and competes in the female division — a situation that attracted the attention of writer Pablo Torre and Sports Illustrated. As Torre tells NPR's Michel Martin, cases such as Godsey's might present "the most thorny question" for sports organizers.
"For Keelin, it's a question of identity," Torre says. "Keelin's identity was formed as a women's sports athlete, before Keelin came out as transgender male. And the reality is, for a lot of college athletes who are transgender, they have scholarships, they have spots on their teams in elite sports, and they're physically that gender — physically female, for example, in Keelin's case. And really, that's enough for a governing body. Or, it should be enough."
Torre co-wrote a story about transgender athletes for Sports Illustrated's current issue. He's also a regular contributor to Tell Me More's Barbershop segment. And they say there are no physical or medical differences between Keelin and a biological woman — there have been no hormone treatments, for instance.
"So, for Keelin it's a matter of choosing and fulfilling that other part of their identity, as an elite athlete," they say.
But that choice can also mean forgoing the medical treatments some transgender people receive when they transition to another gender.
"If you want to stay within your birth sex athletically," Torre says, "you need to forgo testosterone — which is really the big thing."
"And Keelin — let's make no mistake about this, this has been incredibly tough, and at times tormenting and tortuous, for Keelin Godsey, a person who identifies fully as a male, and wishes to live as a male in all walks of life. But, it's their passion for sports and the opportunity to make the Olympic team" that are behind Godsey's choice, Torre says.
As soon as the Olympics experience ends — either in the U.S. trials or at the Games in London — "Keelin will be taking testosterone, and physically transitioning," Torre says. "And that's this other, second dream, beyond Olympic contention, that Keelin hopes to finally fulfill."

With the Russian Collusion Scandal unfolding exponentially every day that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller puts on their shoes and drives to their FBI office, many Republican officials have expressed concern that President Donald Trump is running out of Administration and transition team members to throw under the bus.
During Donald Trump Jr.'s recent testimony to the House Investigative Committee, in which they refused to disclose relevant information pertaining to conversations they had with their father citing a bogus interpretation of a law that does not pertain to the their situation, the President's son appeared to throw Trump communications director Hope Hicks under the bus, suggesting they talked to them about their Trump Tower Russia meeting instead of their dad.
“This is a very troubling development for the Trump Administration and for President Trump himself,” explained Republican Representative Tom Dallas of Oklahoma, who participated in the Congressional interview. “They may have kicked the can down a day or two, but obviously this means investigators are going to come knocking on Miss Hicks' door asking for information. I imagine they will divulge what they know rather than go to prison, and at that point they will confirm that Don Jr. is guilty of Russian collusion and that Mr. Trump themselves knows all about the whole conspiracy. It may have saved these RussiaGate probable cons an extra day to plan their legal defense strategy, but who is really left at this point after disgraced general Michael Flynn conspicuously flipped on the President now that they have apparently even cast out the in-over-her-head communications assistant Hope Hicks, whose job description, for some reason, included steaming Trump's suits while they wore them? At this point the only people Mr. Trump has left to throw under the bus are family members Don Jr. and Jared Kushner. I guess we'll have to wait and find out what Hicks has to say.”
The following is the list of former Trump employees who have been thrown under the bus:
Carter Page, who White House officials have insisted played no major role in the transition, despite listing them as a foreign policy adviser and allowing them to go to Russia to meet with suspected Russian agents.
Paul Manafort, who acted as the Trump campaign's CEO for the critical summer months leading up to the Republican nominating convention, but was described as having played a minor role in the campaign upon their arrest.
George Papadopoulos, who apparently flipped on the Trump Administration in the service of the FBI in the summer, but Trump insisted was merely a coffee boy.
Michael Flynn, who White House officials described as an “Obama official.”
The FBI, which Trump has consistently criticized, calling into question the organization's integrity and insisting that the bureau was in “tatters” because its investigation into Russian collusion appears to have them by the balls, especially following news of Mueller's subpoena of Deutsche Bank's records related to Trump.
Hope Hicks, who Donald Trump Jr. incriminated to buy themselves a couple extra days before indictment.
Classic guilty moves.

The world is full of under-utilized, under-challenged, creatively starving cube dwellers, just dying to break out of the box and kick butt.
You: not satisfied in your current career path, and have a vague, but yet to be solidified, idea of what you would rather do instead and can't wait to make some type of transition to the greener career grass. I don't recommend jumping ship before you have an employment plan to back up that decision. I do recommend taking a hard look at all of your most valuable skill sets, whether they're related or not, and seeing what kind of connection you can make that would allow you to transfer those skills successfully to another type of job.
And maybe you already know what you do well, and what type of career you want to transition into. Now think about what skills you might be lacking, or need to improve upon, that are essential for that career path to open up its welcoming arms to you. I've always been a fine artist, I thrive on being creative, and it would be amazing to do freelance work as a graphic designer. But I'm not very well-versed in Illustrator, and my Photoshop chops are at best, pretty good. So there's a gap there between what I see myself doing, and what I'm fully capable of marketing myself as.
And that will be your biggest challenge in changing careers- successfully marketing yourself as a qualified candidate for the type of career role you're going after. If you lack tangible experience, it's very difficult to persuade a hiring manager or an organization to invest a significant amount of money in hiring you, when there's very little professional measurement of your success in that field.
People like to complain to me a lot of about how hard it is to change careers, and how no one will hire them, how many job apps they've sent out, the hundreds of networking events they've been to, etcetera, etcetera. What they forget is that they made the choice to do so, whether that choice was driven by dissatisfaction, desperation, passion, motivation, or unemployment. The process is not easy, and you will be up against everyone else in your field who DOES have tangible experience. But there are actions you can start taking, whether you've already jumped ship or are contemplating the dive, to effectively position yourself as a qualified candidate and professional asset to your field.
And it's not just about your resume. In fact, it has nothing to do with your resume, and everything to do with building your personal brand from scratch.
VOLUNTEER OR INTERN
A recent study conducted via LinkedIn shows that a majority of hiring managers actually value volunteer experience as highly as hands-on professional experience. Why? Because volunteer experience is STILL hands-on experience, sans a paycheck. I understand that not everyone has the capacity to work for free these days, but even squeezing in volunteer side gigs on an as-need basis every so often, qualifies as hands-on experience. And a big part of doing work for free is about the connections you make while doing it.
CONSULT OR FREELANCE
Similar to volunteering, what kinds of side projects can you take on to build a resume or portfolio to better position yourself for a full-time job? There are people out there who can utilize your services and would welcome the more cost-effective options of hiring a talented and reliable entry-level professional who can still get the job done, and also save them money in the process.
MEET PEOPLE WHO HAVE INFLUENCE
Advising you to “go out and network” is nothing you don't already know. Network, network, and then network some more, but the key is to mingle with and converse with the right kinds of people. Don't bother with the general job seeker networking events that cater to any and every industry – you're mostly going to meet other job seekers and career changers. And while that is fine, you will have the best luck if you target events that are specifically geared toward the industry you're looking to break into. This gives you the opportunity to not just meet potential colleagues, but to talk to people about different trends and skills that helped them get to where they are, and that they consider important for breaking into the field.
SHARE, DISCUSS AND PROMOTE YOUR KNOW-HOW
If you can't rely on tangible experience, then get out there and promote your creative and insightful ideas. Blogging (and commenting on other people's blogs) is a great way to showcase your interest and expertise in a field and connect with others who share the same professional interest. Content sharing sites like StumbleUpon and Digg are great for sharing interesting articles, while Q&A sites like Quora allow you to provide your insight and feedback to questions that your peers have about topics in your field. Another great thought leadership tool is the Groups functionality on LinkedIn, where you can participate in discussions, share article links and pose questions to others in your field. Taking advantage of the appropriate social media and thought leadership vehicles allows you to strategically build your network, gain visibility in your target industry, and position yourself as somewhat of a subject-matter expert in your field.
STREAMLINE YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE
In short, keep the non-professional content to an absolute minimum, and have a uniform presence across all of your social media profiles to the best support your brand. Don't just talk about how you're “looking to break into your field” or are “looking for a job in XYZ”. Brand yourself by discussing your professional interests and promoting your credibility. Creating a uniform presence across a couple of different social media vehicles such as LinkedIn, Google+, Twitter, StumbleUpon, and Digg can also be beneficial to your Google ranking.
Studies show that the typical Gen Y young professional will change careers four times before the age of 30. We are discovering and building new skill sets, and opening doors for ourselves in career paths we never considered before. This is not uncommon, it is challenging, and it is also possible. I myself have conquered the career change challenge more than once, and believe you me, you are no exception to the possibility. It's all about having the drive and motivation to essentially build a new brand from scratch because like building a small business, that is what you are doing when you talk about reinventing yourself. Focus on formulating a good strategy that works off of your most marketable skill sets, finding a relevant need to which your skills speak, and continuing to learn new skills that will open up doors and relationships.

In a landmark vote today, Crimea's parliament has formally declared its independence from Ukraine, extending its de facto autonomy to outright secession, and changing its name to the Republic of Crimea.
Crimean independence isn't going to last though, as the Sunday referendum takes independence as a starting point but provides only two options, either of which will end that status.
Voters will be asked to choose between reunification with the Russian Federation or restoring the 1992 Constitution and Crimea's status as a part of Ukraine. There is no option to reject both possibilities and support remaining independent.
Physically, an independent Crimea is roughly the size of Israel or Kuwait, but its population is much smaller, more in line with a nation like Latvia or Estonia.
This is the first time Crimea has been independent since 1783, when it was annexed into the Russian Empire. It remained part of Russia (and the Russian Soviet Socialist Republic during the Soviet era) until 1954, when Ukrainian-born Nikita Khrushchev transferred it into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. It remained part of Ukraine since, albeit one with a considerable degree of autonomy.
Crimea's population is majority ethnic-Russian, and it hosts the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Though a Russian Unity party in Crimea's parliament has pushed for reaccession into Russia, the region's secessionist push didn't really get serious momentum until the recent regime change in Kiev, which ousted a pro-Russian government.

Following a long hiatus, reclusive philanthropist Alfred Jeffress has announced a new treasure hunt, and once again they are offering a share of their vast personal fortune to the winner.
In a statement, Jeffress confirmed that the event will follow the same format as their previous treasure hunts. A mystery object has been placed somewhere in space, and the first person to find it and deliver it to a specified location will win the competition. Jeffress has released a riddle that they claim will set participants on the path to finding the mystery object:
"The king's resting place is where I'm hid. Entrusted to a queen, with a spring in their steps."
With such a generous prize on offer, the event is sure to capture the imagination of the galactic community.
MESQUITE, NV - APRIL 10: Protesters hang signs and set up camp along US. highway 170 protesting the closure of thousands of acres of Bureau of Land Management land that has been temporarily closed to round-up illegal cattle that are grazing south of Mesquite Nevada on April 10, 2014 in Mesquite, Nevada. BLM officials are rounding up ranchers Cliven Bundy's cattle, who has been locked in a dispute with the BLM for a couple of decades over grazing rights. (Photo by George Frey/Getty Images
Carol Bundy, the wife of a Nevada rancher locked in a tense standoff with federal rangers, warns the ongoing dispute could escalate to the point of a confrontation similar to those at Ruby Ridge and Waco.
"If you saw the artillery and their presence -- the intimidation they are trying to put on us -- it could turn into that," Bundy told The Huffington Post.
They were referring to the federal authorities camped around the Bundys' land in Bunkerville, an unincorporated town located 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas.
The Bundy family and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management have been involved in a lengthy dispute over the alleged misuse of federal land for grazing. According to the BLM, the Bundys have used federally managed public lands for their cattle and have refused to pay the appropriate grazing fees for the past 20 years. The bureau says the family has ignored repeated warnings to remove the cattle. The family now owes more than $1 million in unpaid fees, the BLM says, which prompted the agency to obtain a federal court order last week to seize and auction off the Bundys' cattle.
Carol Bundy and their husband, Cliven, contend their water and livestock rights to use the public lands were recognized by the state of Nevada long before the federal government took over management of the land in the 1940s. They contend that what the federal government is doing constitutes harassment.
Protesters have already gathered on the ground in Bunkerville to support the local ranchers. Carol Bundy estimates there are some 300. But this weekend the situation may escalate.
Militia group members already in Bunkerville are saying that others from around the country, including Florida, Montana, New Hampshire, Texas and Utah, plan to converge on Bunkerville to rally behind the Bundys. "Based on what these groups are hearing from their members," said Robert Richardson, owner and author of Off Grid Survival, there could be as many as 5,000.
Richardson, who is from the area and has been to the Bundy ranch this week, also counted hundreds of supporters already there.
Jack Kay, a professor of communication at Eastern Michigan University who has studied militia groups for 30 years, agrees that the dispute is ramping up. "Everything I am seeing says this is escalating," said Kay.
"It is becoming a flag issue for various militia groups," Kay said. "It is the perfect time -- the perfect storm -- for them to come together and flex their muscles and show that they are going to stand up against what they call 'tyranny' in the federal government."
Kay also points to disturbing similarities between this dispute and the ones that led to the tragedies at Ruby Ridge and Waco. The latter two began with allegations that individuals had violated gun laws and ultimately escalated into armed and deadly standoffs.
Ruby Ridge, Idaho, was the site of a 1992 confrontation between the U.S. Marshals Service and Randy Weaver. The standoff resulted in the death of Weaver's wife, their son and a deputy U.S. marshal.
The next year, law enforcement laid siege to a rural Texas compound near Waco, Texas, that belonged to the Branch Davidians, a religious group. The standoff lasted 51 days, and before it was over, four federal agents and 82 Branch Davidians had died.
Carol Bundy, a mother of 14 and grandmother of 52, insists that their family is trying to "keep it peaceful" and do it "the constitutional way," but so far, they said, that has not worked.
"[Federal rangers] are walking around heavily armed and trying to intimidate and trying to harass," Bundy said. "There are snipers on the hill. They have cameras on our house."
Richardson said they have also noticed the presence of armed BLM law enforcement agents. "I can definitely confirm that," they said. "There are armed agents crawling through that area."
The BLM did not immediately respond to a request for comment from HuffPost on Friday.
But media reports say that armed federal law enforcement agents have locked down a large area as contract employees work to round up the Bundy cattle.
Carol Bundy said that the federal government should just back off.
"Our water and our livestock rights are filed with the state," they claimed. "If you have water rights filed, then you also have access and forage rights for your cattle. We don't own the land; we own the rights to use that land for livestock."
Bundy acknowledges that their family owes significant money in unpaid grazing fees, but they refuse to pay that money to the federal government.
"Everybody wants to put out there that [we] have not paid [for] grazing rights, but we did try to pay the fees to Clark County and the state of Nevada," they said. "We tried to pay to the people we filed the water rights with, but they refused to take it."
Bundy said they and their 67-year-old husband are not budging.
"We're standing for liberty," said Bundy. "We're not going to move. We're not giving up. We're actually gaining strength."
"We have the support of the nation behind us," they said.

The dispute escalated last week, when the BLM seized 352 of the Bundys' cattle that were found grazing on federal land. The Bundys estimate that each of those cattle -- roughly half their overall herd -- is worth between $1,000 and $2,200.
On Sunday, the situation worsened, after Bundy's son Davey, 37, was shot with a stun gun and taken into police custody.
According to Carol Bundy, they were "standing on the side of a state highway taking pictures out of the way of anybody else. They were in nobody's face. They descended on them and threw them to the ground. They beat them up pretty good."
In a statement to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, BLM spokesperson Kirsten Cannon said Davey Bundy was taken into custody to “protect public safety and maintain the peace.”
“While anybody can express their free speech anytime on open public lands in accordance with the codes and ordinances that exist, there are temporary closures of some of the public lands related to this impound operation, and those are in place for public safety,” Cannon said.
Cliven Bundy gave an impromptu press conference after their son's arrest, during which they claimed the government had stolen their cattle.
“Davey is a political prisoner," Bundy said, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. "That's what you want to call them -- he's a political prisoner.”
Davey Bundy was jailed overnight. They received two citations, one for resisting arrest and one for failure to disperse.
Since then, other incidents have occurred.
On Wednesday, a BLM truck was struck by a protester outside the ranch, and a scuffle between authorities and protesters escalated when a police dog was allegedly kicked and officers "were threatened and assaulted," according to a BLM press release.
Carol Bundy said they blame, in part, the governor of Nevada and the county sheriff for letting things spiral out of control.
"We're under martial law right here in Clark County today," they said "To resolve this, I think that Nevada needs to claim its sovereignty -- its equal footing with the original 13."
Kay said that while they do not expect Nevada to "claim its sovereignty" anytime soon, it is possible to resolve the situation without bloodshed.
"In this case, what it comes down to is if the government can find some way to back down and negotiate some sort of settlement," they said. "They haven't collected money in 20 years. What's another few months?"
Kay added, "But the government tends not to want to engage in much appeasement in these types of incidents, and that's what really worries me. The government feels like it can't back down, and the militia feels it's really its time to stand up against so-called tyranny."
For now, it seems, no one is willing to budge.
They saw a way to quarterback their business plan while floating above the grimy details and the law.
Though only 23 at the time, Coles — a community college dropout whose mother was dead and father a convict — was shrewd, with a particular interest in psychology.
There was a complication: with prior convictions for gun and drug crimes, Coles was unlikely to get across the border.
Coles calculated it this way: buy a pistol in Michigan for a couple hundred dollars and feed it to Toronto, where supply cannot pace demand, for 10 times as much.
So they decided to sell guns to Toronto drug dealers.
They used four young women — including two cash-strapped cousins, one of them eight months pregnant — to mule the guns across the border at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel crossing.
Here's what Detroit gun broker Terrance Coles had to say from prison
Star investigation: Star reporters buy cheap U.S. gun, no ID required
“I wanted to be as discreet as possible. I figured it will be less suspicious if someone who didn't have a criminal background (did) the transporting,” said Coles in a jailhouse interview with the Star.
Coles used their grandmother Bertha's cellphone to schedule the deals and negotiate payments.
The deals were swift and money fast.
Then Coles got greedy and reckless.
Somebody was listening in on theirs calls.

Ontario guns by the numbers
A Toronto Star investigation has found pricing along the U.S.-Toronto handgun pipeline works like this:
With a driver's licence, or sometimes without any ID at all, a supplier buys a cheap $150 handgun on the Internet, as Star reporters recently did in Atlanta, or at a store or gun show in Michigan or Georgia, typically anywhere along the Interstate 75 corridor.
A smuggler transports the gun across the border. In Windsor, that $150 handgun will sell for $800 to $1,000.
Another courier (or the initial smuggler who crossed the border) takes the pistol farther, along Highway 401 to Toronto, where the money doubles, the gun selling for $2,000 or more.
Alternatively, smugglers barter guns for cocaine, ecstasy and other drugs more cheaply available in Toronto than in the U.S.
The guns — often stored in a shoebox tucked away in the buyer's closet — are then ready for use in Toronto.
Though the pipeline, in some cases, does not end there.
The Star has found cases where handguns are then rented to the street, in one instance for as much as $600 per night.
The reasons for the hefty markups are not complicated:
Comparatively strict Canadian laws make gun possession and ownership in Toronto difficult. Drug dealers and other criminals desperate for firepower are willing to pay a lot for Hi-Point and other cheap brands of semi-automatics.
“The demand in Canada and the profit for U.S. suppliers are really what is fuelling the gun trade,” Special Agent Mark Jackson of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives told the Star.
The Star's ongoing investigation, which began last week revealing how easy it is to buy a gun in the U.S., will take you along the pipeline, from broker to mule to end user, from the states with lax guns laws to the border where most guns get across to Toronto. Today's story is about a Detroit hustler's growing gun supply business and the lawman on their tail.
To Agent Jackson, who ran the surveillance team, the gun supplier was, at first, just a disembodied, breezy voice on the phone.
Saying they have “Four nice hand boys . . . Two 40s . . . Two 9s . . . a mini chopper” and more.
Jackson wanted it that way. They needed to patiently work the outer edges of the investigation. Rush it, and the supplier might go to ground.
It was months earlier when the agent heard from a confidential source that a Detroit-area gun supplier named “Dougie” was moving guns to Toronto.
Undercover officers posing as Toronto drug dealers put word out in the Detroit-Windsor area that they wanted guns and circulated their cellphone number. Weeks later, “Dougie” called.
Jackson monitored the calls and traced the supplier's cell to an address — Coles' grandmother's house on Santa Rosa Drive in Detroit.
“I had a hunch it was Terrance Coles,” Jackson told the Star. “We needed to set up a face-to-face so we could confirm that this voice we're hearing on the phone was actually Coles.”
Meantime, Jackson, their team of fellow agents, and Windsor police officers followed the mules.
Jackson, alongside Windsor cop Jason Bellaire, started planning what would become the biggest and most complicated international gun smuggling case the veteran agent had ever worked.
By the time it was all over, in a strip-mall parking lot, after Jackson steered their unmarked sedan into the front end of a speeding Dodge Charger carrying Coles and their accomplice, Jackson had worked the case eight straight months.
“It took a very small bite out of the gun trade from Michigan to Windsor and beyond,” said Jackson, who has worked hundreds of gun-trafficking investigations since joining the ATF in 2000. “I think guns are getting across everywhere.”
On Feb. 2, 2008, Coles told their new clients that they had four guns and would also try to find a MAC-10 or MAC-11, a semi-automatic machine pistol easily converted to fully automatic mode — meaning, one trigger pull can quickly fire all the bullets in the high-capacity magazine.
Coles are also eager to discuss other business opportunities.
“Right off the bat, Coles asked for ecstasy. They start by calling them Skittles and thingie-things,” Jackson said. “He said, ‘Look, I can get you guns, can you get me ecstasy?' They knew well enough that a lot of our ecstasy in the States comes from Canada. So I think a light bulb goes on in their head.”
Coles' push to diversify their operation gave agents an idea for how to ultimately catch their man.
On Feb. 5, Coles sent one of their mules, Denisa Manga, to exchange four 9-mm handguns for $4,400 plus a $500 smuggler's fee.
An student studying forensic science at Wayne State University, Manga lived with their parents in Windsor and commuted to and from the Detroit school. A pat explanation for border guards curious about their frequent crossings.
In early 2008, Manga's parents sensed they lost interest in school and that they were “associating with a young man who is not appropriate,” their defence lawyer would later tell a judge. By the time Coles was finished with them a few months later, Manga pocketed little more than $1,200 and was headed for a six-year prison sentence.
The day of the deal, at 2:15 p.m., Manga drove them mother's silver Volkswagen into a McDonald's parking lot one block from the Windsor side of the border tunnel.
Manga got out and then into the buyer's truck. The vehicle was wired for sound and video. “It recorded everything,” a court would later hear. The buyers were two cops on loan from the Toronto Police Service.
Manga sold them a Star 9-mm, loaded with four rounds, and a Glock 9-mm, loaded with 12 rounds, for $2,200. They said they would return that night with the two other guns. The undercovers handed them an additional $2,200 in advance.
Agent Jackson was on the other side of the tunnel, waiting and watching. They followed Manga, saw them meet with a man — later determined to be an associate of Coles — and watched as they stuffed a wad of cash into their pocket. Manga drove off, Jackson not far behind, and met the same man on a dark side-street two hours later.
“I assume they were loading guns in their vehicle,” Jackson said. “Denisa told the undercovers . . . they had a void in their vehicle in front of the dash, in back of the engine. That's the exact location they were standing, kind of in the corner of their hood there.”
Close to 10 p.m., Manga met the undercovers in the same McDonald's parking lot, and handed them two loaded 9-mm pistols, one with the serial number partly obliterated. Manga was paid their $500 smuggling fee.
One of the undercover officers called Coles the next day and said they needed more “burners.” Coles, who often had guns “on deck,” delivered quickly.
From February to June of 2008, Coles sold 35 guns for $36,000, all to the undercovers working the investigation.
Months later, police officers would trace the guns to points of original sale in Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Georgia (all intersected by Interstate 75) and other states where firepower can be legally bought with few background checks and little oversight.
The Star learned that most of the guns delivered by Manga had been sold anywhere from six to 10 years earlier at a Detroit gun store now out of business.
It is not clear how many hands the guns passed through before reaching Coles and ending up under the hoods of their bootleggers' cars.
On Feb. 13, Manga made another border run, delivering four guns, including a Cobray MAC-11 machine pistol loaded with 19 rounds in an extended magazine.
A few weeks later, Agent Jackson finally laid eyes on Coles. The undercover officers had arranged to meet their supplier in a room at a Detroit Marriott Hotel. Jackson and Windsor officer Bellaire set up cameras and microphones and eavesdropped from the adjoining room as Coles discussed future gun deals and their desire to get a large amount of ecstasy pills.
Jackson, comparing the image on the live video feed to a mug shot from Coles' Michigan driver's licence, conclusively identified their target. “The man behind the curtain,” as Jackson later called him, was revealed.
On March 18, another of Coles' smugglers delivered four guns to Windsor. Other deals occurred on April 9, in mid-May and on June 2.
Agents never could identify who was supplying Coles, theorizing Coles got their guns from a variety of sources. Coles told the Star they bought the guns “off of the streets of Detroit.”
“On June 4, we did one last deal,” a Windsor detective later testified. “Multiple arrests took place that day.”
At 2 p.m., Coles and a male associate pulled into a strip-mall parking lot on Jefferson Ave. in Detroit.
Coles' Toronto clients had come through. In a few moments, they would deliver nine guns, just a down payment, for 50,000 ecstasy pills their clients were looking to unload that day.
“(Coles) was asked a couple of times if . . . they could handle that amount of ecstasy and they said . . . that the ecstasy was accounted for and they could move it ‘all day,' ” Jackson later testified.
Jackson watched from an unmarked sedan parked across the street from the strip mall. Other police cars were in the area to cut off possible exits should the planned takedown fail.
Waiting in the parking lot was an undercover ATF agent posing as a cousin of one of the Toronto drug dealers.
Coles noticed a grey van in the parking lot, walked over, tried to see if anyone was inside — but tinted windows blocked their view. Spooked, they tried to move the location of the exchange. The undercover agent convinced Coles to stay and get the deal done.
Coles walked to the trunk of the Charger, popped it, delivered the guns, and replaced them with a suitcase of ecstasy pills.
The pills were fake, cooked up at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lab at the border.
The grey van was in fact full of ATF agents suited in tactical gear for the arrest.
The deal done, Coles got in the Charger and their accomplice drove away. The Charger sped past the grey van. Agents scrambled from the van, yelling at the Charger to stop but were too late.
Agent Jackson watched the failed takedown and drove up Jefferson Ave. toward the parking lot. “The Charger was coming at me.”
Jackson drove their sedan into the Charger, stopped it, and agents swarmed.
Coles clambered into the back seat, trying to squirm away from their captors.
“I saw huge weapons pointed at me so I attempted to get out of the line of fire,” Coles said.
At that point, Coles, whom the U.S. Justice Department later said was the “mastermind of a major international weapons smuggling operation,” likely realized that for some time they were no longer running a growing criminal enterprise; Agent Jackson had been running them for months.
Coles rejected a plea deal, fired four court-appointed lawyers and represented themselves at trial. They made no opening statement in the federal courthouse in Michigan. They introduced no evidence. They did not testify in their defence. They lost. Guilty on all 18 counts.
While behind bars awaiting sentencing, Coles became an ordained minister.
Meanwhile, across the border at Denisa Manga's 2008 sentencing hearing, a judge told her: “You have forsaken the life that you knew and for the friendship or companionship of someone who probably does not value you as highly as you ought to be valued, and for a few dollars of money.”
Manga, who did not comment for this story, is now out of jail. The other smugglers, all American, pleaded guilty in U.S. court and cooperated with investigators. They received sentences of various lengths, none as stiff as the 15 years handed to Coles.
Coles now lives behind the walls of McKean Federal Correctional Institution, about 145 kilometres south of Buffalo. In penitent emails to the Star, Coles said they are a different man, that their “true passion” is to help others.
“It's a shame that you can obtain guns so easily through license(d) dealers which in turn flood the inner city streets with powerful weaponry,” they said. “It saddens my heart to hear that Toronto is becoming more gun violent.”

William Shatner, the actor best known for their role as Captain Kirk on Star Trek, expressed their distaste for social justice warriors and was promptly attacked by SJWs on Twitter and in the media.
Shatner took to Twitter recently to express their distaste over modern day social justice warriors comparing themselves to the social reform movements of the 1960s, which focused on causes such as racial equality and equal pay. Shatner, who took part in one of the earliest interracial kisses ever broadcast on American TV in Star Trek, tweeted, “Why is it that SJW's think they can align themselves with those that demanded social reform in the 60's?”
Why is it that SJW's think they can align themselves with those that demanded social reform in the 60's? https://t.co/6CRVzawgLG — William Shatner (@WilliamShatner) July 31, 2017
When one user claimed that those that use the term SJW and “snowflake” in a derogatory manner would have protested Star Trek's interracial kiss, Shatner replied:
And this is your failure of logic. SJWs stand for inequality, where they are superior to any one else hence my use of Misandry and Snowflake https://t.co/8uBGuFFM7a — William Shatner (@WilliamShatner) July 31, 2017
A flood of responses rolled in to ironically tell Shatner how wrong their opinion was that social justice warriors attempt to exert their superiority over others:
Eat shit old man — luke oneil (@lukeoneil47) July 31, 2017
you're too old to say sjw — raandy (@randygdub) July 31, 2017
So speaks an elderly white man secure and sheltered in their fame, wealth, and privilege. I expected better of you. — (((Stargazer))) (@TwiHusband) July 31, 2017
Shatner's use of the term “SJW” has angered a number of writers as well, such as Gizmodo writer Matt Novak who wrote an article – which displayed a shot of Shatner in a Nazi uniform from an episode Star Trek as it's feature image – attacking Shatner and interviewed Manu Saadia, author of Trekonomics: The Economics of Star Trek, who accused Shatner of using “alt-right language.” Novak themselves accused Shatner of being a “fascist” in a tweet from their personal Twitter account:
William Shatner going fascist is probably the least surprising thing of 2017 tbh — Matt Novak (@paleofuture) July 31, 2017
Meanwhile, Matthew Rozsa wrote at Salon, “Does William Shatner's attack on ‘SJWs' erase their ‘Star Trek' legacy?” Rozsa claimed there was “debate over whether Shatner is betraying their own '60s-era belief in social justice issues.” Citing Shatner's issues with the Reddit community, which Rozsa referred to as a space for “racists and other hate mongers to group,” the author claimed, “Shatner's parroting of the anti-SJW rhetoric regularly seen on those sites — complete with the alt right nomenclature about ‘snowflakes' and ‘misandrists' — is a dead giveaway that they have fallen victim to the very trend they prophesied.”
Rozsa goes on to claim, “It seems pretty clear that there has been a decline in Shatner's character, at least when it comes to their past support for equal rights. It's unfortunate and their critics are right to call them out on it. That doesn't mean that we should struggle with cognitive dissonance over how the man who courageously opposed racism in 1968 can now argue for right-wing establishment views in 2017.” Rozsa then claims that Shatner has “lost their way” for not conforming to the modern leftist groupthink, saying, “These things happen. Shatner is not the first former progressive to lose their way — nor will they be the last.”
But, as with the inaugural round of grades last year, the report cards had many who know the school system well somewhat befuddled.
Again there was a discrepancy between federal and city assessments — 30 percent of the schools deemed failures under the No Child Left Behind act earned A's from the city on Tuesday, while 16 of the city's 18 failures are in good standing under the federal guidelines. And again, schools that had enviable reputations received less than enviable grades, like Public School 8, a respected and popular Brooklyn Heights elementary school, whose F stunned parents.
The fluctuations and jarring results led critics to reiterate concern that the grades were little more than a snapshot of test score improvements between two years.
“I would say that what they are doing is clearly misguided,” said Walt Haney, an education professor at Boston College who focuses on testing issues. “These are showing dramatic changes that can have nothing to do with what is actually happening.”
Most school accountability systems focus on proficiency and, when measuring growth, look at this year's fourth graders compared with last year's fourth graders. But the city's grades are determined largely by how much progress this year's fourth graders have made since their third-grade tests.
So student performance at the schools that received A's varied wildly. In more than 60 of the 394 A schools, for example, more than half the students failed to reach proficiency on the state's reading test. And two of the schools that received A's — Middle School 326 in Manhattan and Public School 224 in the Bronx — were added to the state's most recent list of failing schools in the spring.
Mr. Haney said that it was likely that relatively small schools — of which there are an increasing number, because of the Bloomberg administration's breaking larger schools into smaller thematic programs — would show the most change, since any fluctuation in performance among even a few students would have a sizable impact.

Indeed, according to Education Department statistics, the average enrollment of schools that changed by one letter grade is 683, while schools that moved at least two letter grades had an average of 577 students.
The grades are being used for a variety of rewards and consequences. Principals and teachers in schools that receive A's are eligible for bonus pay, and the schools could receive extra money, while schools that receive a D or an F two years in a row could lose their principal or be shut down entirely.

Eight schools have gotten D's two years running. Three-quarters of the failing schools last year received an A or a B this year.
Given the report cards' emphasis on progress — it counts for 60 percent — the overall increase in the number of A and B schools is no surprise, since major gains on state standardized tests in reading and math were posted last spring in every age group and in nearly every neighborhood.
The grades on Tuesday were for elementary and middle schools. High school grades are expected next month, after graduation rates are calculated.

The complex formula to determine the grades was slightly amended this year. For example, schools got credit for students who scored in the highest of four categories on state tests two years in a row, even if their score within that top category dropped slightly (last year, this cost a school points). Schools also receive additional credit for improving scores for special education students. This year, each report card's three subsections were also assigned three letter grades — for progress, performance and environment — instead of just the overall grade.
The weight given to progress increased in the 2007-8 school year, to 60 percent from 55 percent the previous year, while pure performance dropped in importance to 25 percent of the grade, from 30.
As in last year, all three sub-categories were measured in comparison with a set of “peer” schools deemed to be similar in demographics — race, poverty, special education and students still learning English. For middle schools, the system also accounts for how well its students performed in elementary schools.
Last year, the grades were based on a curve, limiting the number of schools that could get each grade. This year, there was no curve; the change, Education Department officials said, allows the public to see improvement.

James S. Liebman, the chief accountability officer and architect of the grading system, said it was the only school-accountability system in the country where the results could not be predicted by poverty or race, since all results are adjusted based on demographic peer performance. They also said that, analyzing the data, school size and class size do not appear to be important factors affecting progress on test scores.
“What we want with progress reports is to measure what schools add to kids, not what kids bring to the schools,” Mr. Liebman said.
Chancellor Joel I. Klein, who has spoken about the system all over the country and consulted with officials in Australia about developing something similar, said that they were confident that the grades would force schools to consider whether or not they were teaching students at all levels.
“This is not about reputation,” they said. Last year, Mr. Klein said that because the department would collect more data each year, it would consider using three years of test scores to measure improvement. Mr. Liebman said that officials did not do so this year because of the way they had changed the overall formula, but they said they would consider it in the future.
Most of the schools that soared to A from F did so because of significant one-year jumps in test scores from 2007 to 2008, in some cases after drops in 2007 from tests in 2006. Only one school, Public School 92 in the East Tremont section of the Bronx, went from an A to an F; that school had seen significant gains on test scores from 2006 to 2007, only to fall back again in 2008.
Ellen Foote, the principal of Intermediate School 289, a respected school in Lower Manhattan that got a D last year, said they were unmoved by its A year.
“A school doesn't move from a D to an A in one year unless there is a flaw in the measurement or the standardized test itself” they said. “We have not done anything differently, certainly not in response to the progress report.
”I think it's just so disrespectful of the profession, to think that I would respond to a single letter by beefing up my test prep,” they said.
Usually when you sit down to watch a movie you already have drinks and food prepared to eat. But Domino's Pizza has decided to tempt those of us who are less organized into ordering a pizza with a slight modification to the upper surface of DVDs.
As part of a marketing campaign in Brazil, Domino's teamed up with advertising agency Artplan São Paulo to distribute enhanced DVDs to 10 movie rental stores in both São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The DVDs carry relatively new movies including Argo, The Dark Knight, and Skyfall, but have also been coated with a thermal ink and a flavored varnish.
As a DVD plays in a player it heats up, and in this case both the ink and varnish react. The varnish start emitting the smell it contains, in this case freshly baked pizza, and the ink changes to reveal a new image. The end result is your TV room smells of pizza, and when you remove the disc the once blank surface will now look like the top of a pizza. It also carries a message suggesting the next movie be accompanied by a real pizza.
While it's a nice marketing idea, in practice I bet this would just end up annoying the customer. Making a room smell like pizza when you aren't eating it, or trying to enjoy some other snack like popcorn, isn't great. And that's why I think this will remain just a marketing exercise and not an accepted way to add advertising to rental discs. On top of that, I'm pretty sure the ink and varnish would need to be reapplied after every rental, making this an expensive endeavor.
To get an idea of how James Spader will impact NBC's The Office, here's the simple, brilliant pitch behind the show's eighth season premiere: Spader's persuasive and mysterious character Robert California is appointed CEO of Dunder Mifflin and, during a visit to the Scranton branch, accidentally leaves behind a piece of paper. There's a line down the middle of it, with the names of every Scranton staffer either on one side of the line or the other. Employees go into a frenzy trying to figure out: What does this mean?
The episode, titled “The List,” will showcase California's inscrutable oddness and their impact on the rest of the team as they struggle to figure them out. The Emmy-winning Spader, it seems, is just as much in the dark as everybody else about their character, and that's the way they like it.
“He's a sort of strange guy, and their enigmatic qualities are a good thing,” Spader says. “Everybody is trying to get to know who they are and what their juxtaposition is to the rest of the office. The characters are and the writers and cast members as well. And I'm hoping that's going to be the fun of the season.”
The actor is expected to appear in 15 episodes this season — about double the amount of Kathy Bates, who played the CEO last season. “Robert California is there much more,” Spader says. “He doesn't have an office, really. They catch a desk where they can. Already we've also gone out on locations … This is entirely different from [The Practice and its spin-off, Boston Legal]. That was a hour-long show that when I joined, it was a tiny office with four people. This is an office with 18 people and is a half-hour show. I'm really learning who this character is in snippets.”
To help aide Spader's entry into the series, showrunner and co-star Paul Lieberstein and their team of writers have concocted several intriguing story ideas lined up for season eight in addition to “The List” [SPOILER ALERT]: California challenges the office manager to double sales. Dwight builds a productivity machine that becomes a sort of Doomsday device when it threatens to shut down the company if people make too many mistakes. The entire warehouse staff wins the Lotto and quits. And, of course, there's Jim and Pam's second baby.
“We're not doing what we did last time; we're not doing any weird rush to the hospital,” Lieberstein said. “We're doing something fun with their hormones, [which] are in a state where they don't know who to trust. After a scene of everybody being very polite to her, saying she's more beautiful than ever, and ‘the old and the pregnant are the most beautiful,' Dwight is the only one honest with them They start to think Dwight is the only one they can trust.”
And as for who's playing the new manager now that Steve Carell and Will Ferrell have departed? That remains a mystery. The show isn't bringing another actor in for the gig and all parties are staying mum on who will land the title — if anyone. “They didn't just want to bring in a new Michael Scott. There's not an attempt to fill those shoes,” Spader said. “That is something that I think they're allowing a certain amount of flexibility on, not unlike the end of last season. The show is very balanced right now and they want to utilize the ensemble cast.”
Spader joined the show after their well-received guest spot in the show's seventh season finale, which then turned into a semi-full-time offer. “I thought it would be great fun to do it for the hell of it,” Spader recalled. “I had a ball. All of a sudden [producers] called again. I probably should have seen it coming.”
“He killed it,” added Lieberstein. “He lit it up and brought out a really fun part of our other cast we hadn't seen before. We watched the scene over and over again and really liked it and wanted to do more.”

26 Great TV Season Finales
Takiyah Thompson, the woman who climbed the Durham Confederate statue and pushed it over, was charged with two felony counts and several misdemeanors for destruction of private property, inciting to riot and participating in a riot.  They are now being rewarded and cheered!
As a reward for their vandalism and as a supporter of Kim Jong-Un, they will likely be awarded a scholarship. Them legal fees will also be paid by their university – the North Carolina Central University.
Faculty and students have widely applauded them vandalism. This is what has taken over the universities.
The Daily Caller reported:
“I saw the demonstration and the toppling of the monument. I think it's a healthy thing for students to have a voice and to be leaders in activism,” said Jim C. Harper II, chair of the history department. “We're going to do everything we can to support Ms. Thompson.”
Them professor, Allan Cooper, said that the entire class applauded when they revealed to them that Thompson was the person charged with toppling the statue. Following the news, Cooper sent an email to the chair to propose giving Thompson a scholarship.
Scott Holmes, a professor at NCCU's law school is providing free legal advice.
“She is an inspiration to watch,” said Holmes. “She gave a brilliant interview, was arrested, came out and had a big smile on their face.  They are resilient and smart and knows she's done something that has awakened the conversation around race.”
Communists and lawlessness are to be exalted apparently.
Thompson, a member of the Worker's World Party, is a Maoist Communist who hopes to destroy the United States.
This makes the lack of response from our Republicans all the more stunning. They were quick to condemn President Trump for their alleged “immoral” response to Charlottesville, as Mitt Romney posted on Facebook, but they say nothing about these communists.
For months, I have wondered why President Trump continues to allow “verified” leftist trolls to swarm every single tweet they make. It's a form of propaganda and he's under no responsibility to allow it. I've long said they should block the most egregious examples. Now, they finally seem to be doing just that.
Take a look at this salt. Some of these people might need to go on suicide watch. What will their life become now that they can no longer respond to every single tweet The Donald makes?
OH. MY. EFFING. GOD.

Trump is starting to block people on Twitter left and right. What is the legality of that. They use it as "official" comms to America. — Pesach 'Pace' Lattin (@pacelattin) May 29, 2017
(Lol to the illegal suggestion.)
Hopefully, this trend continues. I'm not sure I'll be around to bask in it quite as much, as the idiot from my last post has been spending all morning trying to get me banned…but that's another story. The point is, Trump has no obligation to allow these people to set the tone underneath their every comment. If it was a normal kind of interaction, I could see standing up for their right of reply (even though it isn't owed on a man's private Twitter account, even the president's). But these people are unhinged and should be treated accordingly.
The grantest generation
A sobering chart:
The red lines are the distribution of ages of medical school faculties, in 1980 and 2010; the bars are the distribution of NIH grant recipient ages. Both increased markedly in the 30-year period, with a larger and larger gap between them. I pulled this chart from a YouTube animation that shows the figures in many intervening years. It's a slow march toward older and older grant awards, when the proportion of 55-year-old grantees has doubled, while the proportion of 39-year-old grantees has halved.
Plus a totally new category: the septuagenerian grantee.
I wonder how many of the 65-year-old grantees of 2010 were part of the large crop of 35-year-old grantees in 1980. A fortunate generation of research scientists.
UPDATE (2012-08-26): A reader writes with the story of a scientist who kept the same R01 grant for 28 years, renewing competitively in every cycle, but without any other funding worries until they decided to retire. If you watch the linked video, you'll see a “bump” of grants that ages upward for more than fifteen years. If grants were not renewable, of course, this bump would have smoothed itself out over the course of a grant cycle or two. Instead, we see how a single NIH budget bump was carried forward by a lucky group of researchers across nearly their entire careers!

*I'm hoping for a resurgence of this term.
It's been a while since any of us have seen head or tail of the Open Graphics Project, but they haven't been just sitting around twiddling thumbs. Enjoy an in-depth interview between OSNews and Timothy Miller, the founder of the Open Graphics Project and the main man behind the drive that keeps it going, and Michael Dexter, Program Director at Linux Fund and a key player in Linux Fund's partnership with the OGP. Though it's been some time since there has been much public action, much of the work that the OGP has been putting into the OGD1 is finally coming to fruition.
Linux Fund has raised money to build an initial ten OGD1s for open
source developers. Their fund-raising has exceeded the initial
fundraising goal of $5000; does this mean that additional cards will be
produced?
Our initial estimate of $5000 was based on a combination of hope and
assumptions. Our original estimates were based on a 100-board production run. However, there are costs that remain
fixed when you scale down the quantities, more than we had anticipated.
Fortunately, the nearly $8,500 we have raised has allowed us to go
ahead with a production run of 25 boards and Linux Fund has loaned the
effort the additional funds needed to complete it. We are counting on
selling at least 10 boards to break even and will have them available
for purchase when the first boards are available to volunteer
developers.
Can you please give us an estimate of your progress thus far?
Besides the physical hardware, being build and undergoing testing and
flashing, we have a sizable library of logic
blocks (hardware vendors sometimes call these “IP blocks”) that we've
developed. This includes things like controllers for PCI, DDR memory,
SPI PROMs, video, and even a simple MIPS-like microcontroller.
Using those, we've developed working VGA emulation for OGD1. VGA isn't
trivial since it requires a text mode where characters are rendered
into pixels on the fly as they're being scanned out to the monitor.
Instead of implementing that directly, we use our microcontroller
(named HQ) to convert VGA text into pixels in the background,
continuously scanning and reconverting the text buffer. This approach
was much less invasive than hacking our video controller, and we were
going to require a microcontroller anyhow to support DMA (at a future
date). This also required a VGA BIOS. All of this can be found in the
Open Graphics Subversion repository.
The svn head of the firmware needs some additional work to make it
ready for release, and we could use some help with that. Meanwhile, we
have a slightly older release that
does work, which we will be programming into the shipping boards.
It is important these cards get
into the hands of active developers.
What will happen to a card if its developer withdraws from the project?
Linux Fund owns these boards. Although OGP and Traversal Technology
people are involved in the work, the financial and legal situation is
that Linux Fund licensed the designs under the GPL and paid for the
production. For developers who are given a board for
free, the boards are technically on loan. If a developer decides to no longer be
involved, they can either buy the board or they can help us to pass it
on to another developer. Moreover, Linux Fund should be able to recall
a board at any time if they determine that it is not being used for the
intended purpose.
What is the target price you would
like to sell the consumer version of
your card at?
Originally, OGD1 was a fund raiser, and we were going to sell them at
$1500 apiece. Even today, $1500 is a competitive price for a board of
this complexity, but we will be selling it at half that with the goal of
breaking even.
I just want to make it clear that our goal here is not necessarily to
make a profit. What we want is to build “open” (Free-Design) hardware
products. One way to do it is to create a self-sustaining business.
Linux Fund came along with an alternative. Nobody is making any profit
from this now, but if we're successful with getting developers on board
to make interesting stuff using OGD1 boards, this may attract more
donations in the future that we can use to create hardware products
that Free Software users can really take advantage of.
To Free Software users, the biggest challenge is hardware whose vendors
won't release docs on their products. Without them, we can't make free
drivers that allow us to use the hardware we paid for. For some people,
the answer is to pressure the hardware vendors into releasing docs. For
us, the answer is to create our own hardware with designs that are free
to begin with.
Going forward, we hope for opportunity for commercial development
because quite a large number of us would love to design hackable and
Free-Software-friendly hardware as our day jobs.
Companies that are
enthusiastic about supporting Free Software are something our community
really needs.
Are there plans to develop a PCI express version of the open graphics
card? If so, what time frame will this be in?
This all depends on the community. Before OGD1, we didn't have any real
hardware to show people, so we weren't taken seriously. With OGD1,
perhaps now people will feel we've proven ourselves and decide to get
involved. To make a PCIe version of OGD1 will require community
expertise and community funding.
Please note that OGD1 isn't strictly a graphics card. It's an
FPGA-based prototyping platform that can be made into a graphics card.
But it can also be made into innumerable other things. I'm interested
in doing things ranging from recording-studio quality audio processing
to wireless networking.
You said that you've got 25 graphics
boards produced and
they're ready for programming. What's the process that needs to be done
for said programming?
All of the 25 boards we produced need to be tested for manufacturing
defects and overall serviceability. Once they pass this testing, FPGA
and BIOS PROMs will be flashed with with the latest working firmware. We hope to have the first few boards tested and ready for delivery by OSCON.
You've put out a call for developers,
but do you have a date that
you're looking at for an official launch of sorts? Any shindigs planned
(virtual or real)? How soon will the developers and the purchasers have
their boards?
We don't have any firm dates yet and we are patiently waiting for the
first batch of tested and flashed boards. This whole project has been
an exercise in patience given the nature of hardware. Unlike software,
you can't just tar it up and e-mail to the team. If we have boards by
OSCON, we will definitely raise a toast to the project!
Are you hoping to build more OGD1
boards after these initial 25? How
soon do you think this could be accomplished– or what needs to happen
before this can be accomplished?
We would love to build more boards if the academic or private demand
exists. A second run certainly wouldn't take as long as this first and
it is largely a question of money. No one wanted to take any risks with
this first run and we are fortunate that Linux Fund was willing to
front the extra money we needed.
It sounds like it's been a rough road
for the Open Graphics Project to
accomplish its goals; has it been harder than initially expected? What
were/are some of the major roadblocks throughout the project?
Given that the to-do list was always clear, it was more a question of
frustration than difficulty. Speaking from Linux Fund's perspective,
the first challenge was raising enough money to comfortably begin the
manufacturing process and then minor component-availability issues.
For one of the chips, the price in the US had gone from $5 to over $15 was officially unavailable during the fundraising process. We
found ourselves nervously buying from an overseas vendor using a combination of Skype and PayPal. Luckily, we
didn't end up with a box of expensive chopsticks. Aside from those
challenges, our general dependence on volunteer help has led to a few
delays given that we're competing with personal lives. We'd like to
congratulate one project member on the birth of their daughter during
the project!
That said, everything they say about the challenges of hardware are
true: it is a moving target thanks to component pricing and
availability and the countless physical variables. We're still not out
of the woods until we're sure that every surface-mounted pad is
correctly soldered in place and that no other defects have emerged.
In the big picture, while the OGD1 has relatively good longevity, any
volunteer-driven open hardware project runs the risk of being obsolete
before ever reaching production.
In addition to Linux Fund and the
selling of some of the OGD1 boards to
create sources for funding, have you considered other community-funding
routes such as Kickstarter.com?
While we admire the PR that Kickstarter.com is receiving, we are
concerned that they are neither a 501(c)(3) tax-deductible nonprofit
nor rely on actual funds received. Linux Fund has operated its capital
projects since 2008 and feels it has a better, albeit lesser-known
model.
How many people have really been at
the core of the Open Graphics
Project? Are there any people who especially stand out for their work
and contribution?
Howard Parkin and Andy Fong get most of the credit for the printed
circuit board, with some help from various others along the way.
Timothy Miller developed most of the FPGA logic. Petter Urkedal is
primarily responsible for the HQ microcontroller, along with a lot of
its programming. Mark Marshall is primarily responsible for the VGA
BIOS code. Mark Marshall is the official maintainer of the FPGA code
for the Lattice XP10. Patrick McNamara is the official maintainer of
the FPGA code for the Xilinx Spartan III 4000. Howard Parkin, Mark
Marshall, and Petter Urkedal did a vast amount of simulation and
hardware testing and debugging all of the FPGA and BIOS code to get it
to work to the point you see in this
video.
Is there any room for a newbie to
contribute to this project? What
would he/she have to learn to work on drivers or firmware? Is there an
ODG1 101 to help people interested in the project but with a limited
skill set?
On the Open Graphics Project wiki, there are some Verilog tutorials
we've written for people who would like to get started on learning how
to design chips. Even for those who don't have hardware in their
hands, a lot of FPGA work can be done just in simulation, and there is
Free Verilog simulation software (e.g. Icarus Verilog). Plus there is
a ton of software work to be done. Right now, we have a working BIOS
and microcode for VGA text mode, but we'd like to improve it, adding
things like VGA graphics mode.
Finally, one of my dreams is to make the hardware equivalent of GCC. We
really need a fully free chip design toolchain. Such a thing would
lower the barrier to entry for those who want to design hardware, and
it would also be a huge benefit to hardware vendors. FPGA vendors sink
a lot of money into their synthesis tools. Most are pretty good, but
they can also be very expensive. Developing a free toolchain would
allow the hardware vendors to focus on hardware and give everyone Free
and potentially better tools. I'd say that the cost of proprietary FPGA
synthesis tools is the biggest barrier to entry for someone wanting to
get into FPGA hacking. I have the background in both chip design and AI
necessary to help design these tools, but we'd need a team of
developers to complete the project.
Developers Interested In Obtaining an OGD1
As stated at LinuxFund.org, “the goal of this developer program is two-fold: To guarantee solid open source operating system driver support and to stimulate innovative uses of this unique computing platform. Interested developers are invited to write ogd1@linuxfund.org with a description of their background, technical qualifications and how they would use an OGD1.
OGD1 boards must legally remain Linux Fund property to satisfy IRS requirements and developers must agree to return their board should they discontinue their work for whatever reason, allowing another developer to use the board. Both short-term and long-term projects are encouraged.”

The reporter who says Montana GOP House candidate Greg Gianforte assaulted them Wednesday night is pushing back on Gianforte's account of the altercation, saying they never touched the candidate.
"The only thing in Gianforte's statement that is factually correct is my name and my place of employment," Ben Jacobs said Thursday on ABC's "Good Morning America."
Montana law enforcement officials charged Gianforte with misdemeanor assault after the incident with Jacobs.

Gianforte allegedly slammed Jacobs to the floor at the candidate's campaign headquarters in Bozeman as The Guardian reporter posed questions about the Republicans' ObamaCare repeal plan.
Gianforte's office offered a decidedly different account, saying Jacobs encroached on “a separate interview in a private office” and “aggressively shoved a recorder in Greg's face.”
“Jacobs was asked to leave. After asking Jacobs to lower the recorder, Jacobs declined. Greg then attempted to grab the phone that was pushed in their face. Jacobs grabbed Greg's wrist, and spun away from Greg, pushing them both to the ground,” said spokesperson Shane Scanlon.
The Guardian released an audio recording of the incident, in which Gianforte initially brushes aside Jacobs's question about the new Congressional Budget Office score of the Republicans' healthcare legislation, which passed the House earlier in the month.
"We'll talk to you about that later,” Gianforte says in the recording.
“Yeah, but there's not going to be time,” Jacobs says. “I'm just curious about it right now.”
Gianforte then asks Jacobs to contact the candidate's spokesperson. Before Jacobs can respond, sounds of an altercation erupt.
“I'm sick and tired of you guys,” Gianforte screams. “The last guy who came in here you did the same thing. Get the hell out of here!”
“You just body slammed me and broke my glasses,” Jacobs says. They later posted pictures of the broken glasses from the back of an ambulance.
Jacobs said during the interview Thursday they never "touched or came close to Gianforte."
They called the interaction "very disappointing" in terms of "what it means for the press."
The alleged altercation came just hours before voters headed to the polls.
Thursday's special election pits Gianforte against Democrat Rob Quist in a contest to replace former GOP Rep. Ryan Zinke, who is now heading President Trump's Interior Department. Gianforte is seen as a slight favorite in the race.
Been there, done that

One last ride
Set for UFC 204 on October 8 in Manchester, England, Michael Bisping's first UFC middleweight title defense will be against the accomplished Dan Henderson, whose accolades include PRIDE and Strikeforce middleweight championships."I've been a fan of Dan's for a long time," Dan Hardy, UFC commentator and analyst, said. "He's been a very pivotal character in the development of mixed martial arts over the years, and there was always going to be a point where he'd be fighting too long, and I think he's definitely approaching that now. He's pushing the boundaries a little bit, but this opportunity that he's got; they wouldn't pass it up for the world. That will make me happy."Henderson already boasts a knockout victory over Bisping from UFC 100. That moment is one of the most-played highlights in MMA history. It even prompted Henderson to create their logo in the image of the flying "H-Bomb," which they landed on an already-unconscious Bisping."He knows he's beaten Bisping before, and can do it again," Hardy said. "The first loss that Bisping suffered was so devastating; it's been seen on more highlight reels than my knockout against Condit. It got so much attention. I remember being at the viewing party at the Mandalay Bay, and the reaction of the crowd when the punch landed. It was spectacular from a Dan Henderson-fan perspective, but from Michael Bisping's perspective, it's got to have been on their mind since then."If fans of the sport have watched that Henderson highlight more than any other MMA clip in history, just imagine how many times Bisping's seen it. Hardy feels that particular moment will motivate Bisping more than anything."It comes to mind every time they see Dan Henderson, and to get one up on him--and for it to be their first title defense as well--I think it makes both men very dangerous," Hardy said. "Bisping has a lot to prove being the champion when a lot of people didn't expect it, but also to beat Dan Henderson, who knocked them out in such spectacular fashion."As Henderson gets ready to ride off into the sunset after putting in almost two decades in the sport, Hardy believes knowing this will be their final moment in the spotlight, and in enemy territory, is the recipe for a H-Bomb to end all H-Bombs."For Dan Henderson, they know it's the last fight of their career--win, lose or draw, that makes them very dangerous," Hardy said. "I fought Chris Lytle in a similar situation. Two days before the fight, they announced their retirement. I tried to put them away with everything, and they would not go down, so they (Bisping) knows he's going to get everything Henderson's got, which makes it really interesting for me. What a hell of way to finish a crazy career. It's an exciting fight for the fans."
I've played about six hours of the recently-released Torment: Tides of Numenera beta, and I don't want to play any more. Not because it's bad. Quite the opposite: what I've seen of the game's themes, characters, world, and (to an extent) combat and dialogue systems makes me want to hold off and revisit this title when it's properly finished.
To be clear, Torment's incomplete nature is no secret. This beta is an actual “things are missing and maybe broken, please give us feedback about bugs” type affair, pre-empting a release this week through Steam Early Access (which will probably be a newer build, but otherwise in the same style).
What's available is certainly enough to give an optimistic impression of what the opening few hours of Torment's completed form will be like, but aspects like missing scenes, stand-in user-interfaces, and uneven performance mean any players picking this up from Early Access will need to be committed to dealing with some major rough spots.
As most will know, Torment: Tides of Numenera is an unofficial successor to the much-celebrated RPG Planescape: Torment. That means no Planescape license (this game uses Monte Cook's Numenera world instead), but an attempt to create a game that explores similar thematic ground. Aspects like recurring lives, personal and group morality, plus weird, multi-dimensional, techno-magical shenanigans.
Based on what your character learns during the beta area (and this information may be incorrect, or misleading for narrative purposes), the player is a ‘castoff' from someone called The Changing God. This person (or deity) is prolonging their life by hopping between bodies, and, whenever they leave one, a castoff is created with a brand-new consciousness and a specific tattoo mark. Already, players of Planescape: Torment will notice thematic and symbolic similarities to the original.
After an involved character creation process in which you experience a wealth of memories from other times and places (and make tricky philosophical judgments in each of them), your new protagonist quite literally crashes to the ground in the city of Sagus Cliffs, situated in Numenera's Ninth World. Choices made during character creation determine your three main stat pools (Might, Speed, Intellect) and also define your starting tidal affinity. There are five coloured affinities, associated with philosophical outlooks such as individual justice, creative passion, the collective good, and so on. The implication being that this affinity will shift and alter, depending on choices made throughout the rest of the game.
Any additional effects of this affinity (beyond an indicator of your actions) weren't immediately obvious to me, but may well reveal themselves as the game unfolds.
The Sagus Cliffs setting is a wonderfully bizarre place, and (like last year's Pillars of Eternity) shows that a strong combination of descriptive text and art design can be just as evocative, perhaps more so, than cutting edge graphics technology. It's a location awash with strange sights, like a gushing purple fountain of tiny, enigmatic fish, and rich with intriguing sci-fantasy ideas.
One of a great many pieces of inventive world-building involves the city's levy system. Every citizen of Sagus Cliffs has to ‘raise' a levy, and to do so they must willingly donate an actual year of their life, which then physically manifests as a guard. It's a terrific, rather unnerving concept, and one that aptly demonstrates Torment's other-worldly mixture of technology, magic and (in Sagus, at least) quasi-feudal city-states. There's even an attendant side-quest which pokes at the rather more troubling side of the bargain.
The strangeness of the world and its language will end up as huge asset to the game, but the opening bombardment of concepts is a bit of a hurdle. Your first significant location in Torment's beta is a multi-zoned city packed with a wealth of unfamiliar characters, ideas, and terminology. This pushes a huge amount of exposition (in what is, like its inspiration, already a very text-heavy game) right into the early hours. There's a period in all RPGs of this type where narrative pacing gets temporarily abandoned in favour of players pursuing a check-list tour of “important characters and events in the city”, and it's something none of them has ever really addressed with complete elegance.
Avoid being overwhelmed through this initial barrage though, and Sagus Cliffs feels like a fascinating place to inhabit. There's a lot of weighty, sci-fantasy stuff to deal with, but the city also keeps the player somewhat grounded with universal constants like class divides, semi-familiar structures of government, and recognisable socio-economic development.
Planescape: Torment was a title in which mandatory battles were a rarity. This is something which Tides of Numenera also appears to have taken to heart as a design doctrine. During those opening six hours or so with the beta, I engaged in a grand total of two mandatory fights (and one of those was a tutorial during character creation).
Several character abilities were not yet even present in this beta release, and combat systems and balance are unlikely to be final. Nonetheless, an early fight in the Reef (the outskirts of Sagus Cliffs) had some encouraging aspects to its design. With the right skills, it was possible to prevent the foes from healing, make use of multiple points in the environment (for buffs or damage), and even, potentially, just teleport away and make a run for it. The usual, turn-based “hit a guy with my current weapon” option was there too (and encompasses a flanking system), but there was a clear attempt to provide other, more thoughtful options.
Combat and dialogue-prompted actions alike draw from your character's Might/Speed/Intellect pools. Attempting to heave open a hatch would check against Might, while an effort to steal something from a merchant would test against Speed. Most of the speech-related checks (persuasion, intimidation and so on) seemed to use Intellect. Each action has a base cost and estimated level of success (challenging, moderate, easy etc) and can be boosted a step further by ‘spending' some of your pool.
Ultimately, this will leave you (and any companions you may have with you) short of each ability and in need of rest to top the pools back up. This, though, advances time. And time is something you may not always have in great supply for Torment's quests.
I'll try not to outright spoil too much, but one early quest involves an execution that's both extremely inventive and agonisingly slow. Opt to free the otherwise doomed fellow, and you'll need to do so before their sentence fatally concludes.
Another quest-branch has players investigating a set of murders on behalf of a local underworld enforcer. Sleep on it for too long, and more people start dying. Named people. Ones you've interacted with, and who may (had you acted quicker) have been able to help with other quests. It initially feels unfair, how could you have known to prevent this? But that's really the point. There's a killer at large that you're supposed to be investigating, and they're apparently not going to stop until you get on with it. You did know this could happen, it's just games don't often follow through with their implied threats of consequence.
It's too early to be making any substantive comparisons to Planescape, but I will say that Torment: Tides of Numenera's opening hours are offering an interesting take on those familiar themes of immortality and rebirth. You're another memory-scarred soul, having to deal with people who recognise your former self, wrapped in a pervading mystery about a borderline-immortal traveller and a malicious entity known as ‘The Sorrow'. In contrast to Planescape's single ‘Nameless One' entity, however, Numenera puts (or appears to put) the player in the role of one of many new conscious minds spawned when the Changing God moves out of a given body. It's a subtle, but meaningful, shift in focus.
I want to pick at and unravel all of this stuff. The protagonist's true link to the Changing God, why they still seem to retain echoes of their other selves, whether any of these theories are even true. But I want to do it when the game is in a finished state. If you're the sort who's willing to dive into incomplete titles and offer feedback, then the Early Access release may be for you. Those who lean closer to my own desires to wait should probably do so, because Torment: Tides of Numenera is a compelling beta that shows every sign of turning into a much better finished game.
Study: Loosening Parking Mandates Leads to More Affordable Housing
A recent study by Michael Manville at UCLA [PDF] has been making the rounds on the Streetsblog Network. Examining areas of Los Angeles where parking regulations had been loosened, Manville found that “when parking requirements are removed, developers provide more housing and less parking, and also that developers provide different types of housing: housing in older buildings, in previously disinvested areas, and housing marketed toward non-drivers.”
Shane Phillips at Network blog Better Institutions offered this take on the new research:
Minimum parking requirements result in more space being dedicated to parking than is really needed; in a world of height limits, floor-area ratios, and endless other development regulations this necessarily leaves less space for actual housing. What really struck me, though, was the straightforward assertion that housing marketed toward non-drivers sells for less than housing with parking spaces. It's powerful, but it's also obvious: parking costs money to build, so of course buildings with less parking are cheaper. But to have research-driven data behind it adds force to the conclusion. Right now, parking is usually required in most localities at a ratio of at least one parking stall per housing unit (often more), and in newer buildings it's mostly provided underground. Even though it's ultimately just a big slab of concrete, underground parking spaces cost between $30,000 and $50,000. Each. Sometimes more. Diggin' ain't cheap.
Developers aren't stupid, and they aren't interested in building parking spaces as charity, so they're going to recoup those costs one way or another. They could try to charge residents for the parking, a difficult prospect in some locales where curbside parking is abundant and cheap (or free). To break even, they'd have to rent out every space for every month for thirty years, for between $85 and $140 per month. Or they could just wrap the cost into everyone's rent and give everyone a free parking space. As you add more parking spaces, obviously the cost goes up.

Hungry and keen for a Saturday night at home, Ngaire Stevens logged into their Menulog account only to see the food delivery website recognised them as "Beth", then "Letitia" and then "Peter".
A few clicks later, Ms Stevens, with their husband George Carter beside her, realised they could view other Menulog customers' private information, including phone numbers, home addresses and email addresses.
"We live in Fairlight, Sydney, and yet we were seeing what Beth in Melbourne had recently ordered," the early childhood educator said.
"We then clicked on my account details and up came a Letitia in Dulwich Hill with their mobile number, home address and email address, and on navigating to the front page again it said 'Hi Peter' with a list of their recent orders in Melbourne."
Death of a Nation: The Timor Conspiracy
Of all their films, John Pilger marked the making of Death of a Nation: The Timor Conspiracy, about genocide in East Timor following the Indonesian dictatorship's 1975 bloody invasion and occupation, as ‘the most challenging to my sense of self-preservation and the most inspirational'.
With small Hi-8 video cameras concealed in their bags, Pilger and director David Munro entered the country clandestinely, then posed as representatives of a travel firm. They were joined by journalist Christopher Wenner – credited as Max Stahl to protect their identity – who in 1991 had courageously filmed a massacre of up to 180 civilians in the capital Dili's Santa Cruz cemetery. The fourth member of their team was a London doctor, who remained anonymous. ‘All of us had cameras,' said Pilger, ‘so that, if one or more were caught, some film would get out.'
Eyewitnesses describe how whole communities were murdered resisting the Indonesian invasion and others died in concentration camps and in often unreported atrocities. A report to the Australian Parliament estimated that 200,000 had died violently or starved: a third of the population.
‘I had with me a hand-drawn map of where to find a mass grave,' said Pilger. ‘I had no idea that much of the country was a mass grave, marked by legions of crosses that march all the way from Tata Mai Lau, the highest peak, 10,000 feet above sea level, down to Lake Tacitolu, where there is a crescent of hard, salt sand beneath which lie countless human remains, local people told me.'
In a memorable moment, standing on the edge of this mass grave under cover of dusk, Pilger reads a selection of diplomatic messages sent from Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, by the British, Australian and American ambassadors: damning evidence of their governments' collusion in an Asian holocaust.
The West regarded Indonesia in the hands of the dictator General Suharto as an investors' paradise with a huge market in oil and other natural resources. President Richard Nixon called Indonesia ‘the greatest prize in South-East Asia'.
There is a famous sequence in Death of a Nation shot on board an Australian aircraft flying over the Timor Sea. A party is in progress. Two men in suits are toasting each other in champagne. ‘This is a uniquely historical moment,' babbles one of them, ‘that is truly, uniquely historical.'
This is Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans. The other man is Ali Alatas, Suharto's man. It is 1989 and they are making a symbolic flight to celebrate a piratical deal they called a ‘treaty'. This allowed Australia, the Suharto dictatorship and the international oil companies to divide the spoils of East Timor's oil and gas resources.
Thanks to Evans and Prime Minister Paul Keating – who regarded Suharto as a father figure – Australia distinguished itself as the only Western country formally to recognise Suharto's genocidal conquest. The prize, said Evans, was ‘zillions' of dollars.
One of the film's whistleblowers is a former CIA officer, C Philip Liechty, who was based in Jakarta during the Indonesian takeover of East Timor in 1975. They say, ‘Suharto was given the green light [by the US] to do what they did. We supplied them with everything they needed [from] MI6 rifles [to] US military logistical support... When the atrocities began to appear in the CIA reporting, the way they dealt with these was to cover them up as long as possible.' Pilger asks Liechty what would have happened had someone spoken out. ‘Your career would end,' they reply.
Death of a Nation is journalism and history as topical today as it was almost a quarter of a century ago. Claud Cockburn's maxim ‘Never believe anything until it is officially denied' echoes through a series of extraordinary encounters in the United Nations in New York, Washington, Sydney, Lisbon. It is a story of state violence, betrayal and heroism.
The broadcasting of Death of a Nation in Britain elicited an unprecedented response, according to British Telecom, which recorded more than 4,000 calls a minute to a helpline number. Several thousand people wrote to their MPs, while members of the UN Human Rights Commission credited the documentary with influencing their subsequent decision to send a special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions to East Timor to investigate massacres such as that at the Santa Cruz cemetery.
Jose Ramos-Horta, East Timor's foreign minister-in-exile and later its first president, said, ‘Our struggle for the recognition of our human rights was in the doldrums until Death of a Nation was shown around the world. It changed everything for us. It gave us a visual and factual point of reference – something we could show to governments and say: “Do you find this acceptable?” I have no doubt it was crucial in bringing forward our liberation and saving countless lives.'
The documentary was edited and updated in 1999 under its subsidiary title of The Timor Conspiracy following the overthrow of Suharto in Indonesia. That year, Indonesia surrendered control of East Timor, which finally achieved its struggle for independence in 2002.
Toronto punk quartet PUP is touring strong after the release of their sophomore album, The Dream Is Over , this past May. Interviewer Jason Crider spoke with drummer Zack Mykula about the new album, playing drums, and the days leading up to The Fest in Gainesville, FL.
Your new record is getting a lot of attention and critical acclaim. Howâ€™s that feel?
Itâ€™s cool. You know, we expect more from ourselves than I think anyone else can expect from us, soâ€¦ Itâ€™s obviously cool, weâ€™re obviously grateful for the acclaim, but itâ€™s like, I mean weâ€™ve always just kind of been doing it for ourselves. We are very grateful, and itâ€™s nice to hear that people connect with it. And itâ€™s cool because of the word of mouth that that creates, itâ€™s cool to travel around and have people at our shows that also connect with it, and to cast a wider net, sort of. And yeah, itâ€™s been fun. Itâ€™s been a lot of hard work but a lot of fun.
How did you guys choose that great cover?
It kind of is and isnâ€™t [a non-sequiter]. The photographer, Chris McKenny is just this awesome, kind of impressionist photographer, and it just caught our eye. Iâ€™ve heard people draw the comparison where we live, as a band, we live in kind of world of chaos, and weâ€™re just kind of flippantly or nonchalantly living in that world, which I guess is kind of represented by that guy with the newspaper. Thatâ€™s an interesting comparison or interpretation. But itâ€™s mostly just like kind of a really cool imageâ€”the division between chaos and order, without getting too philosophical, and how it relates to our lives.
So you guys get called a punk band, sometimes a pop punk or even hardcore punk band. How do you feel about those labels?
[laughs] Iâ€™m fine with any of those. Itâ€™s whatever people want to call us. Theyâ€™re not our labels. I donâ€™t think we call ourselves much of anything. But we just happen to fit in that world, I guess. And I can understand it, because we have that aggression and speed, but are also speaking to more emotional stuff. It makes sense to me. But otherwise, yeah, Iâ€™m okay with it. Itâ€™s not offensive, or anything. Weâ€™re obviously not a political band.
Whatâ€™s it means to you to be a punk band in 2016? Is it possible?
I think it is possible and itâ€™s necessary, but I donâ€™t think that itâ€™s in a form that most people would recognize. A lot of punk purists would not necessarily recognize punk music when it comes out, I think. As punk listeners, you come to expect a certain aesthetic and a certain message, and sometimes thatâ€™s not that clear and not neatly packaged in the way that a lot of punk listeners have come to expect.
Yeah, I think it is possible to make punk music in 2016. I think youâ€™re looking to artists with a message. I mean, itâ€™s a pretty broad definition and it kind of destroys and defies the idea of genre classification, but I think punk music is anything that subverts and established order, and you can see that in all forms of music now. It could be that people have been doing punk music all along that you wouldnâ€™t necessarily recognize as punk because itâ€™s not the typical fast aggressive music, but it still questions the established order. So like artists like Solange or artists like The Dillinger Escape Plan or artists like Angel Olsen, orâ€”you know, whoeverâ€”I would consider all of them punk, where most people would not. So, in that way, I think it is possible.
Who is your favorite character on Stranger Things, and why is it Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhardâ€™s character)?
â€œ(laughs) Well, I think my bias would be clear towards Mike Wheeler, but theyâ€™re all awesome. Itâ€™s such a good cast, everyoneâ€™s great, and Iâ€™m excited to see what they do in the future.
You worked with them before Stranger Things, yeah?
Yeah, it was for our â€œGuilt Tripâ€ music video. They auditioned for the part of Stefan because it was us as kids in the video. With short hair, they just looks so much like Stefan did as a kid, and it was just perfect.
Maybe Stefan can be on Stranger Things if they have an episode where Mike is older. Yeah, (laughs) that would be a great crossover.
There are a lot of unconventional time signatures on this record, and a lot of moments where it seems like the drums are calling all of the shots. Whatâ€™s your approach to writing and playing drums in PUP?
The approach changes every time. I try to stay on my feet a lot. I donâ€™t have a set approach. Iâ€™d say that as much as the drums kind of drive it at times, you know, Stefan has such a unique, rhythmic voice, and that definitely helps me create scopes on more interesting, but not overbearing moments like I hope to be tasteful. I could talk forever about writing drum parts, but it mainly comes down to writing something that serves the song but is also novel without swallowing the content of the music. So it makes people listen and maybe puts a new perspective on something that may be old hat or conventional.
Who are your major influences?
Yeah, I definitely have a few. My favorite drummers are Jon Theodore from Mars Volta and now Queens of the Stone Age, and Billy Rimer from Dillinger Escape Plan, and Brooks Wackerman, formerly from Bad Religion. Who elseâ€¦ I mean those are the big three for me right now. Theyâ€™re all like superâ€¦ they all kind of broke out of the milieu in terms of writing aggressive, interesting music without basically, like, jerking off for the entire song.
Did you have anything specific that you wanted to accomplish on this new record, in terms of drumming?
Yeah, I mean, drum-wise Iâ€™m always looking to make rhythmic hooks, basically, and I think I accomplished that in one way or another on some of the songs. I want it to sound good, and also be interesting, but not be the focal point. I donâ€™t know if I accomplished this, but I think that a good drummer isâ€¦You donâ€™t notice when a good drummer does something. So itâ€™s not at the front of the composition, but after a while maybe you go â€˜oh thatâ€™s cool,â€™ and I think thatâ€™s what a good drummer does. So I try to do that.
I know Stefan damaged their vocal chords pretty severely a while back. How is their voice doing now?
I mean, heâ€™s good. Heâ€™s better than they are, obviously. Heâ€™s done a lot of work to bring back the health of their vocal chords, and heâ€™s really worked on rehabilitating, and heâ€™s strengthening, and they do a lot of stuff to care for them. Obviously like drinking more water, getting more rest, kind of easing back on the partying a little, and just in general trying to be healthy. That comes physically and mentally, like stress has a giant effect on your vocal chords and how they function. Itâ€™s just like managing all that stuff and getting better. Heâ€™s doing way better than they are, which is great.
Youâ€™ve played Fest a few times now, right? How do you like Fest?
We played the last two years. The first year we played two shows, and then this last year we played the one big show in the square.
We love Fest. Itâ€™s a great way to see friends and stuff. Everyone gets together in the same place. I donâ€™t think we have anything specific planned. I think we just want to play a fun show. We have an awesome stage that night, I would argue one of the best ones around that night.
What should we be expecting at Fest?
Itâ€™ll be a lot of fun. I would say try to come early and stay late, to try and see all the bands. That day, in particular, is awesome, but I mean every year there are just so many awesome bands. Everyone should just try and see as much as they can.
You guys are touring the world, getting more famous by the day, and both of your records have been met with critical acclaim. It sounds very much like the Dream Is not Over, but maybe Iâ€™m wrong. So hereâ€™s a two-parter: A) What is the dream? And B) Is it over?
You know, that title is obviously more tongue-in-cheek. Itâ€™s more about usâ€¦ the dream is over because youâ€™ve adjusted your expectations. Itâ€™s not as catastrophic as it is necessarily believed to be. I mean, the dream is over, but weâ€™ve just changed our focus, and weâ€™ve been charging ahead, toward that, with all deliberate effort, as we always do. I think thatâ€™s the main focus.
New Delhi: Former BJP leader Arun Shourie on Tuesday told NDTV that demonetisation was responsible for India's economic slowdown and that it was the “biggest money-laundering scheme ever”, helping people covert black money into white.
Calling the move an “idiotic jolt”, the former Union minister said, “It (demonetisation) was the largest money-laundering scheme ever, conceived and implemented entirely by the government”.
Shourie also called the Narendra Modi government as “government of two-and-a-half persons” – “Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and one in-house lawyer”.
“This is a government by ilhaam (revelation). The prime minister has the ilhaam one night that demonetisation should be done and they do it. In any case it was a bold step. I have to remind you suicide too is a bold step,” they said.
The former minister also pulled up the government for its handing of the GST. “Policies that ought to be implemented, and ought to implemented well, like GST, are being completely fumbled,” Shourie said. “The rules have been amended seven times within three months. And you can't even count the number of notifications,” they continued.
Shourie added that the BJP was treating the announcement of the GST like an “event management” exercise. “Look at this! To put a tax reform at par with the independence of India – ‘a tryst with destiny', ‘second destiny', a midnight session of parliament – for a tax reform!”
Shourie's most recent criticism of the government comes days after BJP leader Yashwant Sinha wrote an article criticising the Modi government for making a mess of India's economy. “The prime minister claims that they have seen poverty from close quarters. Their finance minister is working over-time to make sure that all Indians also see it from equally close quarters,” Sinha wrote. Shourie said that they agreed with Sinha that others within the BJP were also worried about where the economy is going and the government policies.
This is not the first time Shourie has been critical of the Modi regime. In an interview with The Wire in January this year, they said, “It (what India is witnessing today) is a decentralised emergency. What we are going towards is a pyramidal decentralised mafia state, where local goons will belabour anyone whom they think is doing something wrong.”
They also said that it was Modi and Amit Shah who were the true “anti-nationals”: They are the anti nationals, they are the ones against our culture. Modi and Shah have ensured the Indirakaran (‘Indirafication') of the BJP. Because if you look at Modi versus the cabinet, there is nobody, Modi and the party, there is no party – only Modi and Shah.”

A day after US Secretary of State set out a vague but hugely ambitious $4 billion economic plan designed to drastically boost the Palestinian economy and help galvanize diplomatic efforts, the Palestinian Authority on Monday summarily rejected the idea of gaining economic benefits in exchange for political concessions.
Slapping down the notion that the PA might be appeased by Kerry's focus on economic improvements, President Mahmoud Abbas's economic adviser, Mohammad Mustafa, said “The Palestinian leadership will not offer political concessions in exchange for economic benefits.” They added, in a statement reported by the Palestinian Ma'an news agency: “We will not accept that the economy is the primary and sole component.”
Mustafa, who also heads the Palestine Investment Fund, said the PA's priorities are not economic but rather a political framework for the creation of Palestinian state based on the 1967 lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital, that also ensures the rights of refugees and a political compromise, the Palestinian news agency added.

Investors are nonetheless more than welcome to “come to Palestine,” the statement added.
At the World Economic Forum in Jordan Sunday, Kerry unveiled a plan that they believe could grow the Palestinian economy by up to 50 percent in the next three years and could bring unprecedented wealth and stability that will spread across the entire region.
Without offering any details, Kerry spoke of a “groundbreaking plan to develop a healthy, sustainable, private-sector-led Palestinian economy that will transform the fortunes of a future Palestinian state, but also significantly transform the possibilities for Jordan and for Israel.”
The top US diplomat said the $4-billion economic plan, coordinated by former British prime minister Tony Blair, could also cut unemployment by almost two-thirds and raise average wages by 40%.
However, Kerry stressed, the success of the plan depends on parallel progress in peace efforts between Israel and the Palestinians.
In recent weeks, Kerry has engaged in intensive shuttle diplomacy between Jerusalem, Ramallah, and Washington in a bid to restart negotiations that broke down nearly three years ago. Israel has stated it would return to the negotiating table as long as the Palestinians drop their preconditions, while the PA has said it won't restart talks until Israel freezes settlement activity and openly agrees to a future Palestinian state being built along the 1967 lines, with minor land swaps.
Also on Sunday, a group of leading Israeli unveiled a new business-led push for Israeli-Palestinian peace. Its aim was to “send the message” to the respective political leaderships that peace was an urgent imperative, they said.
The key Palestinian figure involved, Munib al-Masri, a billionaire member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, told The Times of Israel that they and other Palestinian leaders who have put their names to the initiative are taking a personal risk, given the animosity to Israel on the Palestinian street.
The “Breaking the Impasse” initiative was launched by Israeli high-tech guru Yossi Vardi and al-Masri at a press conference at the World Economic Forum. Vardi told The Times of Israel after the conference that the idea had been “really positively welcomed” by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and “fit in well” with Kerry's efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.

Nacer Chadli: For club and country
These days, there are many talents who jump from a small competition to a big one. Leaving their club without much compensation. Instead of millions, thousands are being received. Some others though, get released by their club and make it to the top through another route. In Belgium, there are a few examples of the latter. Newcastle's Cheick Tioté for instance. Or new Napoli signing Dries Mertens, who couldn't cut it at Anderlecht. And then there's Nacer Chadli. One of the most elegant players to have graced the Eredivisie in years. As we speak, he's being linked with clubs like Tottenham Hotspur, Juventus, Shakhtar Donetsk, Lokomotiv Moscow and Swansea City. Things weren't always that rosy though.
Club (By Michiel Jongsma)
As a youngster, Nacer Chadli found themselves rejected by the Standard de Liege youth system. They joined MVV in Maastricht, a city in the Netherlands, but made their debut for second tier minnows AGOVV from Apeldoorn in 2007. Incidentally, the same club that gave Dries Mertens their ticket to fame. As the tall winger stood out from an early age, it was the performance in the cup in 2009 against Ajax which really highlighted them as an upcoming talent. With the record champion visiting Apeldoorn and struggling, it wasn't one of the highly paid Ajax squad that stood out, but the technically gifted Belgian who stole the show. Turning the Ajax-defense inside out, the Amsterdammers were lucky to escape with a 2-1 win. The main talk after the game was mainly about the previously unknown Belgian and the supporters of almost all Eredivisie clubs were keeping a ‘sign them up' plea for the before unrecognized talent.
After an impressive season for AGOVV, clubs hesitated to pay the Apeldoorn side's asking price (reportedly €1 million) for their services. In the end (the summer of 2010), it was FC Twente who snapped them up. For a mere €400,000 and it's pretty obvious it'll be one of their most profitable signings ever. Instantly, the elegant and skilful Belgian became one of the key figures for Twente, marvelling on the highest stage, the Champions League, and winning the Dutch Cup in 2011. As they developed further, they impressed many in the following season, but reported interest of Fulham was rejected by the player himself. Last season, Chadli was unlucky as they missed a lot of games through injury. However, they had their best season yet in terms of goals, scoring ten and setting up five in 22 appearances. Even more telling was their influence: With the athletic winger (who is comfortable behind the striker or even as the focal point of attack) in the team, Twente won 65% of their Eredivisie games, without them the Tukkers were only victorious 25% of the time. In short: Chadli was the man. What stood out most was and is their technical ability, power, vision and skill. And not only did this become apparent domestically, the Belgian national team profited too.
Country (By Björn de Cock)
Nacer Chadli became one of the favourite players of national team coach Marc Wilmots. Although Chadli is a very talented player they still couldn't manage to make themselves an essential player for the Red Devils. They were unlucky to be injured the moment that the Belgian team really started to conquer the world. In their position, Belgium have Kevin De Bruyne, Eden Hazard, Dries Mertens, Kevin Mirallas… Nevertheless Chadli could become a very important player for the national team. Playing in a better competition and getting rid of their injury prone status would help them succeed. Something many people forget is that Chadli almost played for the national team of Morroco. However, the attacking player decided in January 2011 to represent Belgium.
Marc Wilmots (national team coach of Belgium): “I really like the player Nacer Chadli. I can use them as a winger or as a central attacking midfielder. They also have the right mentality. Nacer Chadli is a player that I will always pick when they are fit.”
It is important for the Belgian winger that they pick out a team where they can grow and become a better player. With the World Cup in Brazil next year, Chadli cannot afford to sit on the bench too. Teams like Chelsea, Juventus and other big clubs could be a dangerous journey for the Belgian, whereas teams such as Tottenham and Swansea are probably better options for them (mainly due to a smaller squad). On the other hand, if Villas-Boas or Laudrup are not very keen on signing Chadli there is no reason to join those clubs. I am quite sure that Chadli will take the right decision, especially when you consider that they have already refused a club of the stature of Shakhtar Donetsk. A beautiful club for Chadli but they would be a little bit off the radar over there.
One thing is for sure, Chadli will leave Twente this summer. Maybe the attacking midfielder is already negotiating terms with a club at this moment. Twente was a gift for Chadli and so was the player for the Dutch club. After Bryan Ruiz, the Dutch club will again lose a very talented player. We all hope that Chadli will have more luck than the technically gifted player of Costa Rica. The Belgian has set their sights on a move to a bigger club and competition and nobody can blame them for that. Even Twente did not have a good season but the Belgian player showed that they are ready to make that next big step in their career.

Manpreet Singh, 22, a resident of Khai village here, who had consumed a poisonous substance on Sunday, died on the same night. They had allegedly taken the step after they came to know that the girl, whom they married a few days ago, believing that they were a Jat Sikh, turned out to be the daughter of a Dalit woman and a Jat Sikh man.
They wrote in their suicide note,“I am Manpreet Singh Brar. My matchmaker Gurtej Singh Baba arranged my match for marriage. I am a Jat boy and my father-in-law is also a Jat, but their wife is a Ramdasia… I was told that they (his wife and mother in-law) are also Jat.”
Manpreet's family also alleged that matchmaker Gurtej had told before the marriage that the girl is from a poor family, but they are Jats and they also took Rs 45,000 for the role of a middleman.
“After the marriage, their wife spent two days with them and after that they went to their parents. When they had gone to their in-laws, they came to know that their wife is a Dalit instead of a Jat. They brought them to their home, but after some time they went to the farm and did not return to home. They consumed some poisonous substance” said, Piara Singh, the deceased brother-in-law.
Meanwhile, police have registered a case under the Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code at Lehra police station.
“He might have committed suicide due to caste issue. We are investigating the matter and Gurtej Singh will be arrested soon,” said Jagbir Singh, station house officer (SHO), Lehra police station.

2017 is shaping up to be one of the biggest years in Esports with several major traditional sports organizations such as F.C. Copenhagen, Paris-Saint Germain, and the owner's of the Golden Gate Warriors and Washington Wizards having invested into a team. Joining the ranks of fellow NBA owners taking the leap into competitive League of Legends is Wesley Edens, the co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks, who in partner with Fortress Investment Group have launched a new team named FlyQuest.
The Bucks aim to make a splash in the Esports scene, but acquiring some of the most well-known names in professional League of Legends. Wesley Edens has purchased the NA LCS spot previously owned by Cloud 9 Challenger for $1.8 million as well as the contracts for the team's remaining four players for an additional $700,000 which brings the grand total of this acquisition to $2.5 million.
Cloud 9 Challenger was the sister team of the parent organization Cloud 9 and featured several veteran League of Legends players Hai, Lemonation, Ballz, and Altec.
During the 2016 preseason, former Cloud 9 Challenger player Contractz signed on with their parent organization as the starting Junlger for 2017. The team defeated NRG Esports in the 2017 NA LCS Spring Promotion tournament 3-0 to secure a spot in the upcoming NA LCS season, but as per regulations by Riot Games Cloud 9 would have to sell their spot as an organization can only field one team in the LCS. Following their success in acquiring an NA LCS spot, a great deal of criticism arose in the community regarding the possibility of teams "farming" slots in the LCS through sister teams. This issue likely contributed to a rule set update by Riot Games that forbid any sister team from being able to qualify for a spot in the main league, but still allowing them to play in the Challenger circuit.
FlyQuest will be managed by Wesley Eden's son Ryan Eden and Fortress Investment Group's management director Sarah Watterson for the Spring Split. This new name in the Esports industry will start off with only a League of Legends team, but have plans to expand into other titles in the future. An official announcement of the team's complete roster is expected to occur in the upcoming week prior to the debut of FlyQuest at the NA LCS which kicks off on Jan. 20th.
The roster of FlyQuest consists of:
An “Balls” Van Le
Hai “Hai” Du Lam
Johnny “Altec” Ru
Daerek “LemonNation” Hart
Galen "Moon" Holgate

Renowned filmmaker Sandy Bates is in a professional transition, directing largely comedies early in their career now wanting to direct more serious movies so that they can explore the meaning of life, most specifically their own. Most are fighting them all along the way, including the movie going public, who continually tell them that they love their movies especially the earlier funny ones, to studio executives who are trying to insert comic elements wherever possible into their current movie in production. They reluctantly agree to attend a weekend long film festival of their movies. Despite the throng of requests for their time, they are further able to reflect on their life as they address the questions at the post screening Q&A sessions. They also reflect specifically on their love life as their current girlfriend, married Isobel, shows up unexpectedly, and as they start to fall for festival attendee Daisy - at the festival with their Columbia professor boyfriend, Jack Abel - who reminds them of Dorrie, a ...

THESE are the eye-opening maps which reveal the areas which would be evacuated if a land-threat tsunami were to strike our coastlines.
The maps, released by the NSW State Emergency Service today, highlight the areas where residents and workers would have to move to higher ground.
While the SES stresses the likelihood of such an event remains quite low, it was vital a plan was in place and people were aware of it.
The emergency service also stresses the release of the maps have nothing to do with the wild weather set to strike Australia's east coast.
But that didn't stop concerns growing on social media that the maps were some form of ominous disaster warning.
The SES posted the maps to its Facebook page earlier today and the post has already attracted hundreds of comments.
Facebook user Samantha Winter posted: “Wtf ... Is there a reason you are posting this with a storm coming?
Another Donald Williams wrote: “Shame there wasn't a rethink on launching this today, with all the East Coast Low Hype going on atm ... Considering just how nonsensical some people and organisations can be ...”
However the SES social media team responded to the hundreds of comments reassuring people it was simply “a set of maps showing areas that will be asked to evacuate IF a warning were issued”.
Other users thanked the emergency service for the info, and reminded people how rare such disasters were.
Shell Perry posted: “Thank you for the info. For those people getting anxious — have a think ...
In all the years that this country has been here in it's current position/shape on the planet, how many tsunamis has it experienced?”
SES spokesperson Becky Collings told news.com.au that it was vital to remember that responding to disasters was the agency's primary purpose.
“This is a tool for the SES to use in the event of a tsunami hitting, we don't want to scare people but we do want them to be aware of it,” they said.
“The risk of a tsunami hitting the east coast of Australia is very low but it is not out of the question.”
They said the agency had an obligation to make people aware that there were plans in place to deal with such disasters.
Ms Collings also added the maps didn't show which areas would be flooded or hit by a tsunami but rather are areas that simply would be evacuated first.
The SES had planned to release the maps today, regardless of weather circumstances and said tsunamis were not weather related but often the result of earthquakes.
It is the first time the agency has released pictorial maps such as these.
In the event of a land-based tsunami hitting, the SES said people should move to higher ground at least 10m above sea level or, if possible, one kilometre away from coastline and rivers.
Minister for Emergency Services David Elliott the release of the mapping is part of its work to build preparedness and community resilience.
“Importantly, the maps show areas which would be evacuated and not areas which would definitely be inundated with water,” they said.
Such maps would be used by the SES in any response planning.
According to these maps, the airport, parts of the city and a lot of the city's coastal areas would be evacuated first.
Marine-threat tsunamis occur around every six years, but in most cases remain dangerous at sea due to strong currents and huge waves.
There has been no record of a land-threat tsunami in Australia since European settlement.
CD Projekt RED's CEO, Marcin Iwinski, has confirmed that The Witcher franchise has sold more on the PC than on consoles. This was revealed in an interview with YouTube's Maciej Pius who had the opportunity to sit down with Marcin Iwinski about the past, the present and the changes in video game industry.
As Marcin Iwinski said at one point:
“Consoles began for real with PS2 from Sony, and then with X360. PS wasn't available for everyone. It was an expensive toy with expensive games. I was already distributing games at that time and I remember what was the expenditure for video games. PS was available for more affluent people and PS2 was available for the masses and started to develop this market. However, the PC still holds strong. Most of The Witcher sales are for the PC, though consoles started selling very well. “
Marcin also confirmed that they prefer playing on the PC, that he's a big fan of RPG games, that they have not played yet Fallout 4, and that they really enjoyed Telltale's games.
Delegate Gregorio Kilili C. Sablan (Ind-MP) warned yesterday against the “disastrous” immigration policies touted by Republican presidential candidates Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, saying that neither of them would likely change their positions to accommodate the Northern Marianas if elected to the White House.
Trump and Cruz this week called for an end to the U.S. visa waiver program in the wake of terror attacks in Brussels, Belgium that left 31 dead and 250 wounded.
Trump, who also has earned the personal endorsement of Gov. Ralph DLG Torres, has called for temporary ban on all Muslins into the U.S. after the Paris attacks in last November and again after attacks in San Bernardino, California in December. They also want to build a security wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
“These terrorist attacks [in Brussels] are horrific,” Sablan told Saipan Tribune yesterday. “We pray for the victims and their families, and for the swift apprehension of all those who were involved in the planning and execution of these monstrous acts.”
“But shutting down our borders is not the answer,” they added. “And what these Republican presidential frontrunners have proposed to do in terms of immigration policy would be disastrous for the Northern Marianas—for tourism as well as labor” and would “also adversely affect our nation's relationships with countries that are our friends and allies.”
Sablan also pointed out that the CNMI's Chinese and Russian visitors are admitted to the Northern Marianas—not through the visa waiver program—but through the parole authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security.
“Which is completely at the discretion of the secretary and can be revoked at any time,” Sablan added.
“If Mr. Trump or Senator Cruz is elected President neither would be likely to alter their national immigration agenda just to accommodate the Northern Marianas,” Sablan said.
“Secretary [Hilary] Clinton, on the other hand, is both very well-informed about the issues in our region and committed to continuing the immigration policies established under the Obama administration, if they are elected president.”
Sablan has publicly endorsed former secretary of state Clinton to be next president of the U.S.
Torres endorsed Trump earlier this month with the local Republican party following suit, casting 343 votes for Trump in the winner-take-all local GOP caucus last March 15, to help Trump overwhelmingly claim the CNMI's nine delegates.
Fox News reported Trump's and Cruz's renewed call to end the visa waiver program on Tuesday.
In 2009, the secretary of Homeland Security exercised discretionary authority to parole into the CNMI visitors for business or pleasure who are nationals of the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China.
The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2009 tasked Homeland Security to create a list of any countries from which the CNMI had received a “significant economic benefit” from the number of visitors for pleasure within the year preceding enactment of the law.
The department determined that the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Russia meet this economic threshold.
Parole is authorized on a case-by-case basis only for entry into the CNMI and does not extend to other areas of the United States.

Festive trade blow for Scottish pubs
Posted on by in Headline, News
Rural outlets remain the hardest hit in ‘difficult' environment
CHRISTMAS and new year business was down for almost half of outlets, with rural pubs the hardest hit, the latest Scottish Licensed Trade Association (SLTA) survey has revealed.
According to the research, which polled 600 operators, 44% of outlets reported a decline in trade over the festive period, with a “marked increase” in the number of venues where business was down 10% or more.
Rural pubs were again the hardest hit with more than 50% showing a decline over the festive period, compared to 40% the previous year; and 46% of rural operators expecting business to grow or remain stable in 2017, compared to 64% overall.
Almost a third (30%) of outlets showed growth over the Christmas and new year trading period, with 26% reporting trade as stable. And festive trading was said to be broadly in line with last year as a whole, with 28% recording an improved performance for 2016, down from 39% the previous year.
Rising costs remain a major concern for operators, with 71% of those surveyed saying utilities have increased and 62% reporting a hike in rateable values – with an average increase of 14%. And concerns over government legislation continue to grow, with 73% of those polled citing it as a key challenge facing their business, up from 67% in 2016.
Despite the tough trading conditions, operators continue to invest in training with 85% maintaining or increasing spend in this area.
Paul Waterson, chief executive of the SLTA, said the trading environment remains “difficult”.
“The fact Christmas and new year business is down is very worrying and only highlights the problems we've got,” Waterson told SLTN.
“Even more worrying is that the figures are down on a low base from last year; that even from a lower base people are not getting growth. And the cost base is going up.
“How the assessors can then slap on these rates increases when other businesses, including supermarkets, are seeing rates go down is beyond me.
“We also continue to see huge pressure for retailers serving rural and tourist locations with over 50% showing a decline over the festive period versus the prior year.
“Many village pubs are integral to tourism and the community within rural areas, and the decline in this area is sadly likely to lead to further closures and wider impacts on tourism and employment.
“The impact of recent drink driving legislation, plus rates increases and minimum wage legislation makes trading in these areas even more challenging for retailers.
“This is reflected in our survey, where retailers highlighted government legislation on drink driving and changes to rateable value as the biggest macro-economic challenges facing their businesses.”
In light of a recent article about the birth of the word “fashionista” in which Stephen Fried apologized for coining the term, we'd like to delve into the -ista suffix in hopes of understanding why English speakers combine it with certain words.
But first, let's look at “fashionista.” This word originally appeared in Stephen Fried's 1993 biography of supermodel Gia Carangi. They invented it as a way to refer to the entourage surrounding supermodels at a photo shoot. The “fashion” portion of term is obvious. Less obvious is the “-ista” part. Fried said that they stumbled upon that particular suffix while researching their 1993 book. They had been reading a lot of late '70s and early '80s newspapers and magazines in order to write about the life of Gia Carangi, and they kept seeing articles about Sandinistas, followers of the Nicaraguan political party.
The –ista suffix comes to English from Latin. The derived English variant of this suffix is –ist, used in words like “machinist,” “apologist,” “Darwinist,” and “novelist.” These types of words describe a person in relation to an activity, item, principle, or doctrine. The Spanish version of this suffix, –ista, became fashionable in English in the 1970s due to heavy news coverage of Latin-American revolutionary movements.
Perhaps Fried gravitated to the –ista suffix to infuse their description of fashion professionals with a dose of exoticism. The high-fashion industry is an international one, and adding a suffix like –ista to the end of the word in favor of the typical English construction has the effect of elevating the term to a sophisticated foreign status. Take the term “barista,” for example. It entered English in the 1980s at a time when the –ista suffix was becoming well-known to English speakers. Calling coffee-shop employees “baristas” certainly gives the job a certain artisanal flair.
Whatever Fried's intentions were in coining “fashionista,” they have now officially apologized for their “crime against nomenclature.” Do you like the –ista suffix? What are your favorite (or least favorite) recent –ista words? Let us know with your comments.

rawdownloadcloneembedreportprint text 2.89 KB Subject: Crime Alert Bulletin PLEASE DISTRIBUTE MIT Police Crime Alert Notice Issued: August 28, 2011 INCIDENT: On Sunday, August 28, a female student reported to the MIT Police, that on Thursday, August 25, 2011, at approximately 11:00 p.m., while walking along Amherst Alley, an unknown male engaged them in conversation, NO assault took place. SUMMARY: The female victim was walking along Amherst Alley, in the vicinity of MacGregor House, when they were approached by a male who claimed to be an MIT Graduate Student in Electrical Engineering, and asked where MIT graduate dorms are located.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) - Amid the institutional labs, offices and classrooms of Rennebohm Hall, home to University of Wisconsin-Madison's School of Pharmacy, lies a room with an oversized sofa, nature scenes on the walls, a chime and a drum on an inlay table and meditative music floating from overhead speakers.
Inside, people are taking psilocybin, the hallucinogenic ingredient found in “magic mushrooms.”
They're not only hoping for a good “trip.” They're helping scientists study the potential of psilocybin to ease the minds of patients with cancer and other conditions.
Nearly 50 years after the late Harvard psychologist Timothy Leary told people to “turn on, tune in, drop out” with psilocybin, LSD and other psychedelic drugs - which became illegal in 1970 - researchers around the country are testing the substances' ability to reduce anxiety and depression in people with terminal cancer.
They're also studying other medical uses, including for addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Psilocybin, known as an “entheogen” for its centuries-old use in religious ceremonies, acts on specific brain receptors to change perception and cognition, scientists say.
Some cancer patients facing death are able to define their personal legacy and reconcile with estranged loved ones, but for many the process is difficult, even with counseling, said Dr. Toby Campbell, an oncologist at UW Hospital who specializes in end-of-life care.
“Psilocybin seems to help significantly more people get to that magic place where they find peace,” Campbell told the Wisconsin State Journal (https://bit.ly/1GzsdGL ). “There's a remarkable amount of living that can happen while dying that is frankly impeded by anxiety, depression and sadness.”
In the UW-Madison study, a dozen healthy volunteers are taking psilocybin in escalating doses over several months. Scientists are measuring the electrical activity of their hearts and examining their blood and urine to see how they metabolize the drug.
The research, combined with two recent studies of psilocybin in cancer patients at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and New York University, could pave the way for a large trial in cancer patients at those institutions, UW-Madison and elsewhere.
Eventually, proponents seek to make psilocybin a less tightly controlled drug and add a bit of mysticism to certain medical settings.
“Psilocybin can occasion … mystical-type experiences that appear virtually identical to naturally occurring mystical experiences reported by mystics throughout the ages,” Roland Griffiths, leader of the Johns Hopkins study, said during a public talk about their research.
The UW-Madison study, which started last year and is nearly finished, overlapped with the death of Tony Robinson, who was fatally shot March 6 by Madison Police Officer Matt Kenny after taking hallucinogenic mushrooms earlier that day.
Robinson, 19, was seen running in and out of traffic and had battered at least one person before Kenny shot them in self-defense, Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne concluded.
While Robinson's behavior and death could serve as a warning against psilocybin use, the UW-Madison study is carefully controlled and designed to prevent such problems, said Paul Hutson, the pharmacy professor overseeing the research.
The volunteers, mostly men in their 20s to 60s, were screened not only for physical health problems but also mental health disorders, since psilocybin can be harmful in people with underlying psychiatric disturbances, Hutson said.
Participants had to have had a prior positive experience with a hallucinogenic drug. That is because the restrictive study environment could agitate the uninitiated, said Michele Gassman, study manager.
“Most people don't take psychedelics with an IV in their arm, and with ECG pads and blood pressure cuffs,” Gassman said.
Before taking the drug, each person is assigned two guides, people experienced in yoga, meditation or mindfulness. The participant meets with the guides for eight hours to develop trust.
On dosing days, volunteers and their guides go to Rennebohm Hall, where a simulation lab has been transformed into a tranquil treatment room.
Two rust-colored parlor chairs, for the guides, sit near an extra-long beige sofa, for the participant. A Persian-style rug covers much of a wood laminate floor. On the walls hang pictures of docks, a banyan tree, a Roman ruin, a tattered window atop moss-coated stairs - along with colorful, abstract prints of musicians and a dragonfly that could easily morph into kaleidoscopic swirls, one imagines.
Before taking psilocybin, many participants meditate, read a poem or play an instrument. Then they swallow the white pill with a glass of water and begin their mental journey.
Most put on eye shades and headphones. Some wear an anti-anxiety blanket. Music ranges from contemplative, chanting and classical to Beatles arrangements with no lyrics.
In about 20 minutes, the drug kicks in. The experience typically peaks in two to three hours, when some volunteers move around or verbalize as they “get things out,” Gassman said.
Later, participants typically grab juice or a snack. The big hit: string cheese. “They find it very fun because it's very stringy,” Gassman said.
By the sixth hour, the altered state is generally gone. But each session lasts eight hours, with the guides staying the whole time and offering comfort as needed. Participants spend the night at the hospital, undergoing more blood and urine tests.
Geoff Gilpin, 62, a freelance writer from DeForest who is in the study, said they used psilocybin recreationally in the 1960s and 1970s. Their three sessions in the study had a much more profound impact on their life, they said.
In the first session, while listening to Bach and Brahms, Gilpin pictured their mother, who has Alzheimer's disease, alone in their living room. They realized they needed to reconnect them with such music. Two days later, they did.
“Our relationship has evolved to a level of love and intimacy that it's never been on before,” Gilpin said.
During their third session, they said they learned to trust people more and become less of a “control freak.”
“I went down the DNA spiral and encountered my ancestry, my family, then the whole human race,” they said.
Later, they saw themselves and all humankind standing on a cliff. “We joined hands and jumped off. At that point consciousness ended, reality ended, ego ended,” they said.
Participants fill out a questionnaire to determine if they have had a mystical experience, but the study doesn't measure spiritual outcome.
“We're mainly interested in their blood and urine,” Gassman said. “This is a pharmacokinetics study.”
The study's estimated $500,000 cost is being paid by a donor through the UW Foundation, Hutson said. They would not name the donor, but the website of the Madison-based Usona Institute - founded by Bill Linton, the founder and CEO of biotech company Promega Corp. - says it is funding a pharmacokinetics study of psilocybin at the pharmacy school.
Linton, through a spokesperson, declined an interview. Their work with Usona was cited as a concern by some shareholders during a hostile takeover attempt of Promega this summer.
Other research on psychedelics at UW-Madison includes work by Nicholas Cozzi, a pharmacologist in the School of Medicine and Public Health. Cozzi has studied the effects of the psychedelic drug DMT and of mephedrone and methylone, banned substances known as “bath salts,” and found potential for therapeutic use.
Hutson said they and other campus researchers are talking about studying psilocybin in people with PTSD. Other centers around the country are testing psilocybin for addiction and ecstasy, or MDMA, for PTSD. In addition, scientists are evaluating psychedelics for obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Hutson and Campbell, the oncologist, hope that results of the UW-Madison psilocybin study, coupled with yet-to-be-published data from the cancer research at Johns Hopkins and NYU, will persuade the Food and Drug Administration to authorize a large trial in cancer patients within a year or two.
Campbell, who anticipates enrolling some of their cancer patients in the large trial, acknowledged that the public could have a mixed response to the notion of bringing back the psychedelic 1960s.
But that is not what researchers are doing, they said. They aren't giving people pills to take or share as they please. They deliver one dose at a time, in a controlled setting, with careful preparation, counseling and follow-up.
“It's pharmacologically-aided psychotherapy,” Campbell said. “You are using a medication to assist in the process of therapy. There is nothing about this that is scandalous.”

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (WAVY) -- U.S. Marshals in Hampton Roads have arrested a man they say claimed to be a Navy SEAL as part of a scam they allegedly ran in Arizona.
According to authorities, 58-year-old Phillip Ohman would identify themselves as a Navy SEAL to earn the trust of businesses and then write bad checks after obtaining property and services. Ohman was known to wear Navy SEAL hats and to have a Navy SEAL bumper sticker on their vehicle. They also allegedly told people they were going on upcoming deployments.
"It lights a fire in my stomach," said Scott Taylor. Taylor served more than eight years as a Navy SEAL. Now a Virginia Beach delegate, they are upset to learn anyone would pretend to be a member of such an elite team.
U.S. marshals say Ohman never served in the military and has a criminal record beginning in the 1980's and spanning several states. It includes multiple prior arrests for writing bad checks, theft, larceny and committing fraudulent schemes.
Ohman has also been known to use different names while scamming their victims, one of which is Phillip D'Marcone.
"For the most part, it sounds like they would play the part. They would talk about upcoming deployments. They would outfit themselves in Navy SEAL attire, and the reality is, Phillip Ohman never served in the military and it really couldn't be farther from the truth. They not only didn't serve in the military, they have a 30-year criminal history," Deputy U.S. Marshal Chris Leuer said.
Fugitive detectives took Ohman into custody July 17 around 5 p.m. at a residence on the 2600 block of Killey Court.
Retired Navy Command Master Chief Bob Santiago took pictures and video of the arrest in Virginia Beach from their backyard Friday.

"I thought, 'oh my goodness, what's happening?'" Santiago said. "All the vehicles came in and took them down over there at their house, in the yard when they pulled their car up in the yard."
Santiago said he'd only known Ohman a few weeks. "When they moved in, they introduced themselves to me as Mike Ohman. A Navy SEAL, special operator, retired 37-year commander," Santiago said. "He started showing me pictures of them in uniform and their coin that they got from SEAL Team 6."
"When they started talking about being a seal, I immediately started thinking, you know, I've worked around a couple SEALs, and they don't act this way. They don't brag, they don't push their weight around," Santiago told WAVY.com.
Leuer said, "Our local military is part of our community right here in Hampton Roads, and to have someone who wants to come into our community not only pretending that they are a Navy SEAL, but then taking a step further and trying to exploit the trust that they have built off their fake reputation as a Navy SEAL, we take that personally."
Ohman is currently being held at Virginia Beach City Jail awaiting extradition to Arizona, where they are faces 11 felony fraud-related charges.
It was all disturbing news for Santiago: "When somebody does this, it bothers me. I think that's very wrong. To me, it's a violation, a serious violation," they said.
Delegate Taylor shared this reminder: "People that are out there in the public really have to be cognizant of the fact that there are people out there who are defrauding you and trying to get money through veterans charities."
Officials want anyone who thinks they may have been a victim to call the Crime Line 1-888-LOCK-U-UP℠.
Why is the Medical Research Council run by an arms manufacturer? Why is the Natural Environment Research Council run by the head of a construction company? Why is the chairperson of a real estate firm in charge of higher education funding for England?
Because our universities are being turned into corporate research departments. No longer may they pursue knowledge for its own sake: the highest ambition to which they must aspire is finding better ways to make money.
Last month, unremarked by the media, a quiet intellectual revolution took place. The research councils, which provide 90% of the funding for acad­em­ic research, introduced a requirement for those seeking grants: they must describe the economic impact of the work they want to conduct. The councils define impact as the "demonstrable contribution" research can make to society and the economy. But how do you demonstrate the impact of blue skies research before it has been conducted?
The idea, the government says, is to transfer knowledge from the universities to industry, boosting the economy and helping to lift us out of recession. There's nothing wrong, in principle, with commercialising scientific discoveries. But imposing this condition on the pursuit of all knowledge does not enrich us; it impoverishes us, reducing the wonders of the universe to figures in an accountant's ledger.
Picture Charles Darwin trying to fill out their application form before embarking on the Beagle. "Explain how the research has the potential to impact on the nation's health, wealth or culture. For example: fostering global economic performance, and specifically the economic competitiveness of the United Kingdom … What are the realistic time­scales for the benefits to be realised?" If Darwin had been dependent on a grant from a British research council, they would never have set sail.
The government insists that nothing fundamental has changed; that the Haldane principle, which states that the government should not interfere in research decisions, still holds. Only the research councils, ministers say, should decide what gets funded.
This is the sort of humbug newspaper proprietors use. Some of them insist that they never interfere in the decisions their editors make. But they appoint editors who share their views and know exactly what is expected of them. All the chairs of the five research councils funding science, and of the three higher education funding councils (which provide core funding for universities), are or were senior corporate executives. These men are overseen by the minister for science and innovation, Lord Drayson. Before they became a minister, Paul Drayson was chief executive of the pharmaceutical company PowderJect. They were involved in a controversy that many feel symbolises the absence of effective barriers between government and commerce.
On 30 November 2001 the ­British ­government decided to buy large ­quantities of a variant of the smallpox vaccine called the Lister strain. The only company that possessed enough was a firm called Bavarian Nordic. On 6 December 2001, Drayson was among a small group of business people who took breakfast with the then prime minister, Tony Blair. At about the same time Drayson gave a donation of £50,000 to Labour. Soon afterwards, government officials sought to buy the vaccine from Bavarian Nordic. They were told that they were too late: PowderJect had just bought the exclusive distribution rights for the UK. So the government had to buy it from Drayson's company. It paid PowderJect £32m: £20m more than PowderJect had paid Bavarian Nordic. The prime minister's office and Drayson both refused to answer questions about whether the Lister strain was discussed at the breakfast in Downing Street. It is not clear if Drayson was aware at that time of the government's decision to choose the Lister strain.
Drayson doubtless rubs along well with the chairperson of the Medical Research Council, Sir John Chisholm. They founded a military software company before becoming head of the government's Defence Research Agency (DRA). They were in charge of turning it into the commercial company QinetiQ, through a privatisation process that was completed while Drayson was minister for defence procurement. During this process, Chisholm paid £129,000 for a stake in the company. The stake's value rose to £26m when QinetiQ was floated. A former managing director of the DRA described this as "greed of the highest order". Lord Gilbert, a former minister of defence procurement, remarked that "frankly the money made by the leading civil servants was obscene … They did not contribute anything to the turnaround of the company, it was the work of the research staff that made the difference." Chisholm remains chairperson of QinetiQ. Is there anyone outside government who believes that these people should be overseeing scientific research in this country?
In March Drayson told the Royal Society that "the science budget is safe … there will be no retreat from pure ­science". A month later this promise was broken, when the budget transferred £106m from the research councils "to support key areas of economic potential": which means exchanges of staff and research with industry.
Science policy in the UK is now governed by the Sainsbury review, which the government says it will implement in full. It was written by the Labour donor, former science minister and former supermarket chief executive, Lord Sainsbury. The research councils, the review says, should "be measured against firm knowledge transfer targets" to show that they are turning enough science into business. They have been told to fund £120m of research in collaboration with industry. This has been topped up with £180m from the regional development agencies. The government is also spending £150m "to change the culture in universities: boosting the work they do with a whole range of businesses and increasing commercial activity". All this is another covert bailout, relieving companies of the need to fund their own research.
The economic impact summaries they now write ensure that all researchers will be aware that the business of universities is business. As the white paper points out, universities are already "providing incentives (for example promotion assessment)" to persuade researchers to engage with business. If your research doesn't make someone money, you're not likely to get very far.
Even judged by its own objectives, this policy makes no sense. The long-term health of the knowledge economy depends on blue skies research that answers only to itself: when scientists are free to pursue their passions they are more likely to make those serendipitous discoveries whose impacts on society and the economy are both vast and impossible to predict. Forced to collaborate with industry, they are more likely to pursue applications of existing knowledge than to seek to extend the frontiers of the known world.
Knowledge is not just about impacts. It is about wonder and insight and beauty. Much might never have an application, but it makes the world a richer place, in ways that the likes of Lord Drayson would struggle to perceive.

HOW DO I ADD STUFF TO MY REWARD? This is the #1 question we get from backers. It's confusing, largely due to the fact that Kickstarter is not designed to work the same way as normal web store. But, the actual process is pretty simple:
1. Choose the item you want to add and note the corresponding dollar amount. If you want to add multiple items, simply add up their corresponding dollar amounts.
2. On the Kickstarter Page, click the manage my pledge button. The Manage My Pledge button is right near the top of the Kickstarter page. If you have not yet backed this project, the button will be green and say "Back this project." The Manage My Pledge button is right near the top of the Kickstarter page. If you have not yet backed this project, the button will be green and say "Back this project."
3. Increase your pledge amount by the dollar amount you noted in step 1, and click Next. Note that when you add items to your pledge there is no additional shipping fee. In this case, the backer is increasing their $40 pledge by $26 to add on 3 shells.
4. Confirm your new pledge amount by clicking next. You're done! A week or two after our campaign ends we will email you a survey. In that survey you will specify which products you want to add onto your reward.
Thank you to Adam for their great suggestion!
(fine print) Only the most popular shells will be plastic injected, for the 2nd and 3rd most popular options, they will be 3d printed, and finished by hand. These will be 3D printed at ultra fine quality, and then primed and coated by hand. The quality is very good, if you look at our models, the red truck and classic car are both 3D printed!
About the Project
As a Scale auto fan I've looked all over the world for matchbox sized RC cars but I've never been able to find a high quality micro RC car (outside of some very expensive DIY kits from Germany). Quantow was started to help small and medium sized businesses create brand-new products.
After helping several customers with record-breakingly small Bluetooth projects, we realized we had the solution right in front of us! With Bluetooth 4.1 BLE, we had a low power, high function way to control a remote control car! The Quantow ‘Gear' Minicar was developed completely in-house, from concept design, to mechanical design, PCB design, to programming; we developed everything ourselves over the last couple months.
Now we've reached the end of the development cycle and we've been searching for a way to fund the tooling for production. Help us bring the Gear Minicar to market (and get a great gift at the same time!).
Our Production Plan
Some basic definitions, T0 is first test batch of plastic injected parts from production tooling. T1 is parts/products that have final surface finishing applied and is production ready. Pilot run is the initial production run, between 1000 pieces to 2500 pieces, and is used to develop SOPs for 'full scale' manufacturing of 10,000 pieces or more.
Currently we have ordered all the electronics components and PCBs for the initial pilot run. SMT will commence the week that our Kickstarter ends.
We have ordered the tooling for the chassis and suspension parts. T1 is estimated by mid October.
Sports car shell tooling has been designed and ready to start pending our approval. T0 might be done by mid October, T1 will be completed before end of October.
Gears, wheels and tires are wrapping up their designs due to some last minute tweaks to the ratios but they will be ready by October 1st, tooling for these parts are much simpler so we might get T0 before end of October and T1 will be done by first week of November.
Truck and charging stand tooling design is ready but we lack the funds to place the order! If our Kickstarter is successful, we will rush the tooling and plastic injection so we will have parts in our hands by mid-November.
Since Christmas product deliveries for most products are shipped by Ocean containers (21-30 days), production will start to wind down by mid-November; we have negotiated with a factory to reserve a production slot for us for the last 2 weeks of November. We have worked with this factory before so we know they will make the deadline. This is the reason that only supporters who choose Express shipping might get their 'Gear' Minicars by mid-December. There is a chance that supporters who choose regular shipping can get their rewards before Christmas, but just to be safe this is not something we are promising right now.
Thank you from the Quantow Development team!

Located about 3,700 light-years away, in the direction of the Cygnus constellation, lies a distant planet called Kepler–1647b, which at approximately 4.4 billion years of age is roughly as old as Earth.
But that's about where the similarities end, because Kepler–1647b turns out to hold a pretty sensational point of difference: this newly identified world is the largest planet ever discovered that orbits two stars. Known as circumbinary planets, these strange cosmic phenomena are often called 'Tatooine' planets, after Luke Skywalker's dusty desert home.
An international team of astronomers led by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Centre just announced the discovery of Kepler–1647b, which has a mass and radius that are nearly identical to Jupiter's. But just because this circumbinary planet might be the largest of its kind that we currently know about, that didn't make locating it any easier.
"[F]inding circumbinary planets is much harder than finding planets around single stars," said astronomer William Welsh from San Diego State University (SDSU). "The transits are not regularly spaced in time and they can vary in duration and even depth."
The team identified the planet using data recorded by the Kepler space observatory, and adding to the challenge was Kepler–1647b's other remarkable feature – the immense length of its orbital period. At 1,107 days, this is the longest of any confirmed transiting exoplanet astronomers have yet found.

This means it takes over three years for Kepler–1647b to orbit its host stars - both of which are similar in size to our Sun, with one being slightly smaller, and the other being slightly larger.
That epic orbital period is the result of Kepler–1647b being located further away from its host stars than other circumbinary planets, which usually hold relatively tight orbits. In the image below, you can see just how much wider Kepler–1647b's orbit (in red) is compared to its circumbinary counterparts (in grey), with Earth's orbit (in blue) added in for reference.
"It's a bit curious that this biggest planet took so long to confirm, since it is easier to find big planets than small ones," said SDSU astronomer Jerome Orosz. "But it is because its orbital period is so long."

Evidence for Kepler–1647b's existence was first found back in 2011, when one of the team, Laurance Doyle from the SETI Institute, spotted the planet transit in front of one of its stars. But it took several extra years of analysis and observations – supported by amateur astronomers using the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescopes in the US and South Africa – before the researchers confirmed that Kepler–1647b was a circumbinary planet.
While Kepler–1647b's distance from its stars is greater than usual for a circumbinary planet, it's actually within the habitable zone – the distance from a star at which liquid water could exist on a planet's surface, not being so far away that it would freeze, nor so close that it would evaporate.
But, in this case, since Kepler–1647b is a gas giant like Jupiter, the researchers think it's unlikely to host life – although there's a possibility any as-yet-undiscovered moons orbiting the planet could provide a suitable environment for it. Sadly, this means there's probably nobody looking up to see a beautiful two-star sunset like the one Luke Skywalker watches in Star Wars.

But just because we probably won't find alien life on Kepler–1647b doesn't mean the planet isn't a major find. In addition to its record-breaking size and orbital length, the scientists think this Tatooine-esque planet could herald the discovery of a new generation of similar worlds that have eluded us until now.
When you consider that the first such planet – Kepler–16b – was only discovered five years ago, it becomes clear why this is such an exciting time for astronomy. Kepler–1647b is the 11th confirmed circumbinary planet discovered by the Kepler telescope since then.
"Habitability aside, Kepler–1647b is important because it is the tip of the iceberg of a theoretically predicted population of large, long-period circumbinary planets," said Welsh.
The findings have been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal.
When plans were shelved to replace the Waterford Hospital, the mental-health facility was left with a $10-million backlog of critical repairs — and nearly two years later, very little of the highest-priority work has been done, according to documents obtained by CBC News.
According to a July 2015 email from Eastern Health president and CEO David Diamond to Denise Tubrett, an assistant deputy minister in the provincial Department of Health and Community Services, work was put off for years because of the expectation of a new hospital to replace the aging Waterford.
"As you are likely aware, we have not done any significant maintenance on this facility in the last three years in anticipation of a new facility," wrote Diamond.
David Diamond, president and chief executive officer of Eastern Health, said in a July 2015 email that significant maintenance at the Waterford Hospital had been put off for three years in anticipation of a new facility. (CBC)
A list of maintenance requirements prepared at the time identifies just over $10 million in repairs listed as Priority 1: "Currently Critical," — from $1.1 million for electrical wiring in the Waterford's centre block to $551,000 for windows in the east wing to $52,000 for plumbing fixtures in the north wing.
Fraction of the work done
A CBC access-to-information request for a list of Priority 1 repairs that have been completed since May 2015 revealed that, of $10 million worth of items deemed "currently critical," about $52,000 — one-half of one per cent — has been spent as of the end of November 2016. Several items on the critical list have not been addressed at all, with the list noting that conditions are being monitored and will be repaired "as required."
The items that need repair or replacement include:
The boiler room roof, a cost of $94,198. Despite the roof being listed as "beyond its useful life" in 2015, the follow-up report says "repair or replacement is not required at this time."
Emergency exit lighting in the north wing, a cost of $104,129. Nothing has been done. "This is currently monitored in house. Replacement not required at this time," says the report.
Radiators in the west wing, a cost of $789,816. "Repairs will be completed as required," says the report. As of December, $8,268.21 has been spent.
Defence lawyer and mental-health advocate Mark Gruchy told CBC they aren't surprised maintenance was put off for so long at the Waterford — it makes sense, they said, given the repeated government promises to replace the hospital — but added it's "shocking and deeply disturbing" to them that repairs are not being done.
"We have to be leery of the fact that there are some people who I believe would just as soon let the Waterford fall apart in the hopes that there would never be such a hospital again, for their own reasons, and there are other people who are more interested in spending money in other areas, and are heedless to the tragedy that is going on in that hospital," they said.
$650,000 in new funding
Diamond declined an interview request from CBC, but Eastern Health provided a written statement that said, "As the provincial government continues to reaffirm their commitment to redeveloping the Waterford Hospital and in an effort to be fiscally responsible, Eastern Health has no plans for major infrastructure work at the site beyond what is needed."
We can't ignore them to death when people have to use that facility and live there. It's shameful. - Mark Gruchy
The assessment completed in May 2015 was intended to help with long-term capital planning, says Eastern Health. An item identified as "currently critical" doesn't necessarily need immediate attention, says the statement, but should be monitored so it can be repaired or replaced as needed.
Eastern Health's statement also referenced Health Minister John Haggie's announcement last week of $650,000 for upgrades and renovations to the Waterford's psychiatric assessment unit.

This funding will help enhance the care we provide to those who come to us in emergency situations," said the statement.
New hospital not expected soon
Gruchy said the entire hospital has been in need of replacement for decades.
"If the people of Newfoundland and Labrador do not appreciate, in an ongoing and constant basis, the travesty and disaster that is occurring there on a daily basis, nothing will ever be done, which is why it has existed in that state, in various forms, since the 19th century."

They said with the provincial government currently projecting a $1.6-billion deficit, it's not surprising that a new hospital isn't in the works any time soon.
"No one is out there enough to think that suddenly $300 million is going to appear or what have you, but we have to deal with these stop-gap issues, and we can't just ignore them to death," they said. "We can't ignore them to death when people have to use that facility and live there. It's shameful. It shouldn't be happening."
The photographer LaToya Ruby Frazier can capture the decline of an entire economy, the vulnerable cycles of American industry, within a single human face. Like the documentarians Dorothea Lange and Gordon Parks before her, they scale down social upheaval to the intimate, modest scale of portraiture. It is the long shadow of the Rust Belt steel boom that especially compels her; they are a black child of Braddock, a “financially distressed municipality” of Pittsburgh, according to the Pennsylvania government, where Andrew Carnegie and the barons of metal had once established monopolies on that dangerous, alchemical work. Frazier was born in 1982, and when they were growing up the steel mills of Pittsburgh were closing down, and jobs were going overseas. Residents moved toward work. In 1920, at the industry's peak, Braddock's population topped twenty thousand; by 1990, it was down to forty-six hundred. Frazier remained—for their family, they had to remain—and devoted their photographic practice to tracking the fragile endurance of their “ghost-town” home town. They have called the camera the key to her, and their community's, survival. They approach their subject “not as a curious or concerned outsider but as a vulnerable insider.”

In 2015, the same year they were awarded a MacArthur “genius” grant, Frazier met Sandra Gould Ford, another insider, at a conference in Pittsburgh. In an e-mail correspondence, Frazier told me that they felt an instant affinity for Ford, who is an artist, photographer, teacher, and writer. Frazier learned that Ford had been a secretary and clerk at Jones & Laughlin Steel Company, a competitor of Edgar Thomson Steel Works, where Frazier's step-grandfather had worked. There were other synchronicities—both had lived in Pittsburgh's Talbot Towers housing project in the eighties, when Frazier was a newborn and Ford was a newlywed, Frazier told me. Ford occupied a part of Frazier's mind for two years, until the two women reconnected this past summer and began an artistic collaboration. The result is “On the Making of Steel Genesis: Sandra Gould Ford,” a joint series, currently on view at the August Wilson Center, in Pittsburgh, that forges a record of Pittsburgh's black working-class life from Ford's excerpted photographs and Frazier's humane storytelling.

Frazier's portraits of Ford give the sprawling show its center. Once they began photographing Ford, Frazier told me, “it was difficult for me to stop.” “We were inseparable. I'd arrive at their house in Homewood, PA around 10 am and spend the entire day until 10pm or 11 pm.” Through Frazier's lens, Ford is conveyed as a woman full of grace, humor, and memory. They smile, but just barely, cradling a hard hat in their home office, their jacket emblazoned with a Jones & Laughlin insignia. From a distance, Frazier finds Ford sitting on the bank of the Monongahela River, a body of water that had been corrupted by the once-blasting furnaces and mines. In another, Ford takes a photograph of electric meters near the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in Braddock.* Frazier's deferential vantage point gives the impression that they are following Ford, physically and spiritually. Theirs is not the conventional dynamic of artist and muse; both photographer and subject are black women at work.
Frazier, the portraitist, sometimes suspends us in the sky. As their aerial photographs scan Pittsburgh's changing grid, Ford supplies the exhibit's history. A self-appointed archivist, Ford did lay anthropology work following J. & L.'s closure, “documenting the human traces on the factory infrastructure.” Frazier wrote to me. They collected original copies of company grievance records and fatal-accident reports, and hundreds of documents pertaining to the closing of the mill. At J. & L., photography was forbidden, but Ford took pictures anyway, at covert angles. “Goodby Mice + Rats,” is scratched into one wall in a photo taken right after the complex shut down; “Pensions Please” is etched into another.

Workplaces create special cultures, and the disappearance of industry can see those cultures reduced or obliterated. Frazier chose to make cyanotypes of Ford's documents, turning them a chemical dark blue. This emphasis on process, I think, reminds the viewer that art, too, is a synthetic labor, an accumulation of intentions, of access, and of time. In a sense, the re-making of Ford's J. & L. paraphernalia acts as oblique portraiture of a community of workers, of the unknown and the dead. Frazier, who does not mince words when it comes to their moral instincts, told me that the exhibit is intended as a memorial. The artist-archivist, invested in the virtues of both occupations, is a public figure the country needs.
“On the Making of Steel Genesis: Sandra Gould Ford” will be on view at the August Wilson Center, in Pittsburgh, until December 31, 2017.

WAR and rugby league are often compared, especially the representative games. They're likened to going into battle. But they're clichés to United States lock Nick Newlin.
He's lived the very real horrors of war, and those that follow.
While they survived two deployments, many of their fellow marines didn't.
One of their closest friends, Dylan Schoessner, returned from service physically unscathed but privately, the black dog had got to him. Post-traumatic stress disorder cost them their life.
It's through Newlin that Schoessner's memory lives on.

“We had a few injuries that were quite severe,” Newlin told foxsports.com.au of their time at war.
“Unfortunately, I lost one of my brothers three years ago, last week. They took their own life. PTSD is a real thing. It definitely hit home for a lot of us who were deployed together and were brothers.

“Unfortunately they took their own life after two years out of the service.
“I wear a bracelet around my wrist 24/7 to represent their life. They were a great guy. PTSD certainly rears its ugly face when it hits home with one of your mates.”
THIS ISN'T A GAME
Sweating and fatigued, Newlin is on high alert.
No it's not a game of football.
The forward is posted in Afghanistan.
This is war.
Sleeping behind a barricade of sand, the sound of explosions has woken Newlin and their Marine Corp ‘brothers' plenty of times.
So conditioned to life in the desert, the sound of bombs going off in the distance almost becomes normal.

“When you go on a convoy, we would spend a lot of those nights with nothing but a barricade of sand around you and you're on constant watch,” Newlin said.
“It's always in the back of your mind when you're sleeping that you don't know what's going on out there.
“We had a few times where you'd get waken up in the middle of the night with artillery going off but we knew what to do and handled our business and sometimes it was just one of those nights.”

Newlin, co-captain of the World Cup team, was motor transporter in the logistics unit. For the common man, it means there wasn't a vehicle in the Marine Corp that they couldn't drive.
Having served in two separate tours across 2010 and 2012, spanning seven months each, Newlin faced the real prospect of losing their lives as they ventured on to the front line but their mind was conditioned to block out fear.
“There were times there was a lot of anxiety and nervousness and got the blood flowing, especially on my first deployment where I was a machine gunner on one of the vehicles for three months of the deployment,” they said.
“We're taught from day one to really not fear anything, so I don't know if I could say I was fearful for my life.
“We did a logistics re-supply to the front lines and trying to avoid IEDs (improvised explosive devices) over in Afghanistan was our main goal, besides supply the guns on the front line with what they needed.”
MOVING ON, FINDING FOOTY

After four years of active service, it was time to start a new life.
Six months before leaving the Marines, their wife Erin gave birth to their daughter Kadence, who is now five and in kindergarten.
They moved their family to Atlanta after their service ended in 2012 and now works in sales for Australian-based plumbing company Reliance Worldwide Corporation.
Having played American football and rugby in college for the University of Wisconsin, it was in Georgia that they learned about rugby league.
After auditioning for a spot in the USA Rugby League's new franchise the Atlanta Rhinos, Newlin was named team captain. It was their rookie season.
“I've always led from the front and led by example from the marine core on and I definitely think that's transferred to rugby league,” the 30-year-old said.
The following year, they helped guide their men to a grand final and while they lost, they made their Test debut for the USA.
With rugby league rapidly growing abroad, the success of the Toronto Wolfpack has prompted interest from New York investors to start a Super League franchise in the Big Apple. Newlin would be keen to be part of it.

“I would raise my hand and try to be part of the team. Some USA players definitely need to be there and if I could make that cut, I think I'd be a good asset,” they said.
“It would be great. New York is probably the best spot to do it. Sports fans there are very diverse.
“One of the big things of having 12 Americans in the World Cup team, this is the grassroots from growing and spreading the word.”
When discussing American sports, it's impossible to not touch on the protests of players in the NFL, refusing to stand for the national anthem.
Taking a knee or sitting is an act which has enraged many, including President Donald Trump, and it's something the team has discussed.
“We spoke about it briefly,” they said.
“We're all going to stand proud with our hands on our hearts and sing for the flag … we're on foreign soil and we're all 100 per cent proud to be American and stand for that flag.”

Newlin and their teammates will sing the anthem when their campaign kicks off against Fiji in Townsville on Saturday.
While running head on at someone like Ashton Sims would terrify most men, a body with little more than a jersey as body armour is a dream for the 108kg middle.
Partly modelling their game off Parramatta and Italian lock Nathan Brown, Newlin likes to “bash and I'm not afraid to pass”.
While he'll be playing for the jersey and their teammates, their fallen brothers from the war in Afghanistan are never far from their mind.
Playing rugby league is the only time the tribute to their ‘brother' Schoessner leaves Newlin's body. While he's thought about taping the bracelet so they can wear it while he's playing, he's conscious of it impeding their performance.
“I usually take it off for a game,” they said. “But otherwise I wear it around.”

In a victory for advocates of EPA action to reduce global warming pollution, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals has just announced that EPA acted properly in assessing the risks of climate change and has taken appropriate action under its authority. The decision is a blow to petitioners, various states and industry groups, who are challenging pollution standards the EPA is promulgating to rein in global warming. Industry was arguing EPA was improperly construing the Clean Air Act and that it was acting arbitrarily.
The Court, composed of both Democratic and Republican appointees, differed and sided with EPA. It concluded 1) the Endangerment Finding and Tailpipe Rule are neither arbitrary nor capricious; 2) EPA's interpretation of the governing CAA provisions is unambiguously correct; and 3) no petitioner has standing to challenge the Timing and Tailoring Rules. “We thus dismiss for lack of jurisdiction all petitions for review of the Timing and Tailoring Rules, and deny the remainder of the petitions,” the Court said.
NWF, which intervened on EPA's behalf in the case, applauded the decision. Joe Mendelson, NWF director of climate and energy policy and a co-counsel on the historic “endangerment” case, said:
“This decision is three strikes and you're out. It puts to rest a mob of big polluters' attempt to stop the Environmental Protection Agency from using the Clean Air Act to limit carbon pollution and tackle the threat of climate change.”
A copy of the decision is here: DC Circuit Opinion 6-26-12
The case comes less than a week after the U.S. Supreme Court in American Electric Power v. Connecticut strongly reiterated the 2007 endangerment ruling stating, “Massachusetts made plain that emissions of carbon dioxide qualify as air pollution subject to regulation under the [Clean Air] Act”.
The climax was playing out like another Edward Jones Dome nightmare, the home team on the verge of surrendering what was left of a once-healthy advantage and suffering another disheartening defeat.
Like everyone in the stadium Sunday, not to mention millions of television viewers, St. Louis Rams coach Jeff Fisher could see the way this one was heading, what with their win-starved team clinging to a two-point lead and about to punt the ball back to the Seattle Seahawks and their red-hot quarterback, Russell Wilson, from deep in its own territory with just under three minutes remaining.
It was the perfect time for a stunning plot twist -- and who better to provide one than The 'Stache?
In January of 2000, Fisher brought us The Music City Miracle, giving their Tennessee Titans an unfathomable playoff victory over the Buffalo Bills.
Last May, Fisher electrified the Rams' unsuspecting draft room -- and made an historic move no one saw coming -- when they selected Michael Sam, who was bidding to become the NFL's first openly gay player.
At Sunday's pivotal moment, as is their custom, Fisher kept even their closest confidantes in the dark. When they sent in the fake-punt call on fourth-and-3 from the Rams' 18, only a dozen others were in on the audacious ploy: special teams coach John Fassel and the 11 men in the huddle.
Music City Miracle, meet the St. Louis Surprise.
Punter Johnny Hekker took the snap, waited for Benny Cunningham to flash open on the left and delivered a short pass that the running back caught and turned into an 18-yard gain. The Rams (2-4) would get another first down and kill the clock -- though not until sweating out a Tre Mason fumble and ensuing scrum -- to close out a 28-26 victory over the defending Super Bowl champs.
It's not too much of a stretch to say that the Rams, who've struggled in the wake of quarterback Sam Bradford's second torn ACL in less than a year, might have salvaged their season by upsetting the Seahawks (3-3). Having blown leads of 21 (to the Dallas Cowboys) and 14 (to the San Francisco 49ers) in their previous two home games, the notion of squandering a 21-3 edge to Seattle was one that Fisher couldn't stomach.
In fact, before the Rams ran their first-down play from their own 11 on that final possession, Fisher approached Fassel and told them to "make sure (Hekker's) ready" because a fake punt might be in the works on fourth down.
"They had such momentum," Fisher explained on their drive home from the Dome, their voice a mixture of relief and excitement. "And look -- Russell Wilson's really good. We had them down, and they took it over. So no, we wanted no part of them at the end."
Wilson, in the wake of a wild week that featured the stunning trade of playmaker Percy Harvin to the New York Jets and a broken foot suffered by fullback Derrick Coleman in pregame warmups, was superlative in the second half, finishing with 313 passing yards and 106 rushing yards on seven carries. Game manager? Yeah, right.
St. Louis, riding with a pair of former third-stringers in the backfield -- quarterback Austin Davis (18 of 21, 152 yards, two touchdowns, no interceptions) and Mason (18 carries, 85 yards, one TD) -- needed a full-squad effort to prevail.
And, amazingly, the fake punt wasn't even St. Louis' most impressive special-teams stunt. That came midway through the second quarter when the Seahawks, trailing 14-3, punted from their own 49 -- and the Rams countered with a well-rehearsed ensemble performance that turned deception into an art form.
With Jon Ryan's high punt sailing toward the right (from the Rams' perspective) sideline, return man Tavon Austin and nine other Rams drifted to the left to set up a phantom runback. As Austin pretended to wait for a ball that was headed to the opposite hash mark, the Seahawks dutifully followed, buying the ruse even as they fell backward for effect, presumably gunning for that Oscar nomination.
Meanwhile, Rams receiver Stedman Bailey tracked the ball, made a nice over-the-shoulder catch and, still largely undetected, turned and raced down the right sideline for a 90-yard score.
"What you have to understand is that they're so good on special teams, and that's what allowed us to run that play," Fisher said. "Their punter is money -- we knew if they were between the 45-yard lines he'd hit it end over end with great hang time, and put it on the numbers. We needed the kind of kick that would (theoretically) force a fair catch, and we knew he'd give it to us, and that's why it worked.
"We scripted that play in practice and ran it over and over, and it pretty much played out that way. Tavon did a little too much -- the falling over backwards, I don't know where they get that -- but Sted made a sweet catch, and then we got them some help and pulled it off."
Facing the prospect of having to defend Wilson on a potential game-winning drive, the Rams needed just a little bit of help -- and Fisher gave it to them, in the form of the Hekker-to-Cunningham completion that might have kept their playoff dreams flickering.
"Hey," Fisher said, "whatever it takes."
For this team, at this moment, it's a legitimate mantra -- and there's nothing fake about it.
