"Bachelor in Paradise" cast member Corinne Olympios is calling what happened June 4 during filming for the show in Mexico their "worst nightmare."
A drunken sexual encounter between Olympios and DeMario Jackson shut down production on the summer series for an internal investigation after a producer filed a complaint alleging workplace misconduct.
“I am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened ...," Olympios said Wednesday in a statement released by publicist Stan Rosenfield, who also represents the likes of George Clooney and Robert De Niro and, for seven years, worked with Charlie Sheen.
"Although I have little memory of that night, something bad obviously took place, which I understand is why production on the show has now been suspended and a producer on the show has filed a complaint against the production," Olympios' statement continued.
What Warner Bros. referred to as "misconduct" has been described as a drunken encounter in which the two disrobed in the Playa Escondida pool and allegedly engaged in sexual acts that didn't include intercourse. A major issue is whether all parties were capable of granting consent to sexual contact.
Jackson — who was portrayed as a "villain" who already had a girlfriend during their recent stint on "The Bachelorette" — has been silent so far about what happened during filming except to tell TMZ on Tuesday, before Olympios' statement came out, that they were "all good" with what they might be saying.
But a source close to them told People on Wednesday that they "certainly isn't the man he's being portrayed to be. It's hard for their loved ones to sit and watch most of the slanderous accusations and comments from individuals who don't know anything about who they are."
According to a source close to Olympios, they have not seen footage from the night in question.
"As a woman, this is my worst nightmare and it has now become my reality," Olympios said. "As I pursue the details and facts surrounding that night and the immediate days after, I have retained a group of professionals to ensure that what happened on June 4 comes to light and I can continue my life, including hiring an attorney to obtain justice and seeking therapy to begin dealing with the physical and emotional trauma stemming from that evening."
Olympios has hired high-profile attorney Martin Singer, according to TMZ. Singer's clients have included Sheen, Jim Carrey, a dozen A-list actores whose photos were stolen from their phones and, until 2015, Bill Cosby.
A veteran TV producer who has not worked on any shows in the "Bachelor" franchise spoke to Variety under condition of anonymity about the industry-standard release that is typically signed by reality-show contestants.
"We're talking about a document that is thick and weighty, that releases the production company and the network from almost every conceivable possibility. It is encompassing. I can't even think of enough words to describe how in-depth that release is....," the producer said.
"The language in the document basically outlines the fact that you will be presented with every type of environment, people, and compromising situations by volunteering to be on the show," the producer continued. "Now, there is nothing in there that would constitute your willingness to be in an illegal act."
On Tuesday, "Bachelor in Paradise" host Chris Harrison issued a statement about the controversy.
“There are a lot of competing details in the various press accounts of the incident. And there's a lot of misinformation out there too," Harrison said. "We urge everyone to be patient until the investigation is complete."

Gas prices are reaching punishing levels in Metro Vancouver.
Prices hit an average of $1.536 on Monday after they hovered close to $1.50 per litre since late February, according to GasBuddy.
Coverage of Vancouver gas prices on Globalnews.ca:
Surely, there's a way to temper prices in a region where people are already stretched thin by astronomical shelter costs.
Expanding Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain pipeline is one way to do it, if you ask an expert. But ask another and he'll tell you they don't see any relief coming from that project.
Here are a few answers to questions about high gas prices, and whether the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion could do anything to cool prices at the pump.
Could Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project calm gas prices?
That question nets a firm yes from Michael Ervin, the senior vice-president at Kent Group Ltd., a London, Ont.-based analytics firm focused on the petroleum industry.
“Absolutely, it would lower the price,” Ervin said.
“With the extra capacity there, it would allow wholesale prices in Vancouver to basically go down to the same level as across the rest of Canada.”
Ervin said Vancouver is facing tight supply conditions for gasoline, and that increased capacity could allow for prices to drop.
“It's economics 101,” they said. “There are no ifs, ands or buts about it.”
But Anthony Perl feels differently.
An SFU political science professor and the co-author of Transport Revolutions: Moving People and Freight Without Oil, they said B.C. is unlikely to see any bargains from increased supply because of the cost of financing infrastructure like the Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion.
“They're going to want their money back,” Perl told Global News.
“Not in 50 years, but in 15 years, and that means higher prices because of the higher return, higher interest rates, expected returns on that investment.”

Perl said the proponents of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion will want all their money back soon, and that they're already spending lots of cash to meet the conditions of its approval — not to mention dealing with protests.
“I don't see any relief from that frankly,” Perl said.
Why are Vancouver's gas prices so high?
Vancouver gas prices are spiking for a number of reasons.
One of them is that supply is tight, Ervin told Global News.
Burnaby's Parkland refinery is a key supplier for the Lower Mainland, but it can only meet a portion of the demand there, Ervin said.
That means supply has to come from elsewhere, like the Cherry Point refinery in Washington state.
Beyond that, refineries are reaching supply capacity, and “that's where you see refinery margins increase as you would expect of any commodity,” they said.
This is also the time of year when refineries are switching from winter to summer fuels, Perl noted.
“They have to stop and recalibrate,” they said.
“They have to clean out and replace certain pieces of the infrastructure, so that means typically the output goes down in the autumn and spring season.
“That usually triggers an increase in price.”
How much do high gas prices have to do with taxes?
Plenty, relative to other cities — but that's not the only reason.
Metro Vancouverites pay $0.3217 of tax on every litre of clear gasoline, according to the provincial government.
This chart shows the price of gasoline in Vancouver from 2007 to 2018. The green line is wholesale gasoline not including tax, the red line is gasoline including tax. Prices shown as cents per litre (data via Kent Group):
The taxes work like this: $0.17 goes to TransLink, $0.0675 to the B.C. Transportation Financing Authority (BCTFA) and $0.0667 to the provincial carbon tax, which goes into general revenue.
And that's without considering sales taxes.
Is Vancouver seeing the highest gas prices in its history?
No — but they're not far off the highest on record.
At $1.497 per litre so far in March, the average price of gas in Vancouver is the highest it's been in years, but it's not the highest ever.
The high mark for Vancouver gas prices for the data it makes available was $1.518 per litre in June 2014.
Nevertheless, Vancouver's gas prices are higher this month than in any major Canadian city that Kent Group looked at — higher than Calgary ($1.13), the City of Toronto ($1.242), Montreal ($1.272) and Halifax ($1.13).
This chart shows the price of gasoline including tax in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Montreal from 2007 to 2018. Prices shown as cents per litre (data via Kent Group):
When will gas prices drop again?
Prices could take months to come down, if history is any indication — but it's hard to say how much they'll fall.
Vancouver gas prices shot up to $1.352 per litre in June 2015 before calming to $1.164 in October of that year.
In the following year, gas prices grew to $1.228 in June before falling to $1.16 in November 2016.
In 2017, prices climbed to $1.388 in April before they fell to only $1.326 in July.

The long-term trend for gas prices is up, but that could change if commuters switch over to new energy sources such as electricity, Perl said.
“If it happens slowly, then gas prices are going to keep going up because there's still going to be a lot of demand,” they said.
“If batteries and other electric vehicles come in faster, then we may not see huge increases in gas prices, because there won't be as much demand for it.”
A 2016 report by the World Energy Council forecast oil demand peaking sometime between 2040 and 2050 as people are expected to move to alternative fuels.

With February declared Heart Month, many countries and organizations around the world are encouraging us all to start good habits now that will improve heart health not just for February but for life.
With smokers almost twice as likely to have a heart attack compared with people who have never smoked, and smokers under 50 eight times more likely to have a major heart attack according to recent research, quitting smoking is the single best thing you can do for your heart health.
According to the British Heart Foundation, it's never too late to give up and reap the benefits, with the risk to heart health decreasing significantly soon after you stop.
Here we round up top five tips to help smokers stub out and reduce the risk of not only coronary heart disease, but also of stroke and various cancers.
1. First of all make a plan. Think about what could help you stop smoking, such as buying some nicotine-replacement products, or booking an appointment with your doctor for help and advice.
Bernard Antoine, a smoking cessation and addiction specialist in Paris, France, also suggests trying hypnotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) to help you successfully quit, while a small study from the University of Haifa suggests that taking omega-3 supplements can help reduce cravings.
2. New Year might have passed but it's still not too late to set healthy new habits for 2017, so make a date to give up, and stick to it!
Although research is mixed as to whether going cold turkey or cutting down gradually is most effective, try to use your "quit day" to throw away all your cigarettes, tobacco, lighters and ashtrays and start afresh, and have your plan from step 1 ready to go.
And if you're female you might want to time the date with your menstrual cycle, with research suggesting that nicotine cravings may be strongest after your period and that women should start the stop-smoking process just after ovulation.
3. Tell your family and friends that you're quitting and enlist their support -- a 2016 study showed that smokers with partners who offered practical and emotional support and encouragement were more likely to successfully stop smoking than those who had unsupportive partners.
You could also consider asking friends and relatives who have quit for their own advice and success stories to help keep you going. Talking to your doctor, a nurse or pharmacist can also be helpful.
4. Keep busy, it will help to take your mind off cigarettes and break the habit.
Try to change your routine, avoid the shop where you normally buy cigarettes, and don't replace tobacco with e-cigarettes, as Antoine believes that this does not help most smokers break the habit.
5. Treat yourself. Stopping smoking is difficult, so reward yourself with the money you're saving by not smoking and buy yourself something special.
Harvey Weinstein is launching a private foundation to be called the H. Weinstein Family Foundation.
When the Democratic donor was asked if he's giving Donald Trump a chance after Hillary Clinton lost, Weinstein told the Hollywood Reporter's New York issue: “The less said, the better. Among the things I'm doing: a private foundation.”
The foundation will honor their late mother, Miriam, and other family. They told THR, “I'm raising all the money. We're going to support [everything] from LGBT to women's rights, more women directors, the National Endowment of the Arts. I'm going to finance a lot of it privately.”
Sources tell us Weinstein will name a board of “well-known experts from each of the fields … Harvey will not be the one making the decisions. Each of these experts will be overseeing the grants and decision-making.”
The source added that Weinstein has been meeting with their contacts from the medical field to Silicon Valley to get involved in their new organization. “He feels that it is time for people like themselves to privately support causes that the government will not.”

MANILA: Seven people were injured when two bomb explosions rocked a petrol station in a southern Philippine city near rebel enclaves, police said Tuesday (Apr 18).
An improvised explosive was thrown on Monday night on the roof of the gasoline station in Tacurong city on Mindanao island, which has been plagued by a decades-old Muslim insurgency.
Two soldiers, three police officers and two civilians were wounded when a second blast went off minutes later than security forces were about to cordon off the area, said regional police spokesperson Superintendent Romeo Galgo.
Two suspects have been arrested but their identities and the motive for the attack were still under investigation, Galgo added.
"We cannot conclude yet that this is an act of terrorism. We are looking at all angles as there are threat groups in surrounding areas," Galgo told AFP, referring to Muslim rebels in the strife-torn province of Maguindanao.
Nearby towns are also home to communist rebels waging one of Asia's longest insurgencies and the incident could have been linked to extortion, Galgo added.
The blasts occurred in a section of Mindanao that had been troubled by the Muslim insurgency and high crime.
Mindanao is the ancestral homeland of the Muslim minority in the largely Catholic Philippines.
The Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the largest Muslim rebel organisation, is in peace talks with the government but other extremist gangs that have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group routinely carry out bombings and kidnappings.
Alec Baldwin brought their wife, Hilaria, to the East Hampton Library event where they signed copies of their new book, “Nevertheless,” wherein they write about “growing up” and “the famous people I have known and the joy I had working with them.”
Baldwin soaked up the compliments about their wicked impersonation of President Trump on “Saturday Night Live” while chatting with guests. They told admirers who were worried that they won't return next season to “SNL” to reprise their role as the leader of the free world: “Don't worry, I'll be back, but maybe not as much. I need to see what we can laugh about by then.”
They also said they will moderate “The New Normal in News: Ideology vs. Fact” at Guild Hall in East Hampton on Aug. 21st. Baldwin sits on the board of the arts and cultural institution, which opened a show by the late photographer Richard Avedon on Saturday night.
Kim Wille is the creator and founder of Growing Empowerment. They are building self-wicking beds around the Lift-Up in Parachute. Over 100 pallets have already been cut and are ready to go.

FOR SK AND BARANGAY POLLS
The Cebu Police Provincial Office (CPPO) has recommended putting the entire town of Tuburan in northern Cebu under the election watchlist or “areas of concern” for the upcoming barangay elections.
CPPO Director Senior Supt. Edgar Alan Okubo said in a press briefing on Tuesday that the town's history of electoral violence and heated political rivalry has qualified it to be in the list.
“Past elections recorded violent incidents and presence of enemy movements. Possibly yung CPP-NPA, presence nung possible thugs, private armed groups, so those have been considered para dyan sa pag-declare sa Tuburan election office area,” said Okubo.
Tuburan Mayor Democrito Diamante Jr., for their part, said that they already anticipated that the town will be under the election watchlist.
“Dinhi sa amo, init man ang politika. Mao to nga the past week, kami tingali ang una nga municipality sa tibuok probinsya nga gipa-surrender namo ang mga armas,” said Diamante.
(Political rivalry is really simmering in our town. That's why I think we are the first municipality in the province that urge for the surrender of loose fire arms.)
Diamante said that they would appreciate it if there will be more police officers and military deployed in the town during the election to avoid violent incidents from happening.
Okubo said that although the studies that they have conducted implied that some suspected thugs have been observed only in two barangays, there is a big possibility that they will extend their operations to other parts of Tuburan hence they recommended putting the entire town under the election watchlist.
Aside from Tuburan, Okubo said that they may also put in the watchlist the municipality of Daanbantayan.
This pronouncement however, was questioned by Daanbantayan Mayor Vicente Loot.
“Asa man nga election ang dili hotly contested? Ang barangay election is bugno na sa mga pamilya. I don't know what's their basis [for considering Daanbantayan as part of the watchlist] ,” said Loot.
If a town is under the election watchlist, the provincial police and the Comelec may consider augmenting the military presence in the said town.
But if Loot would have their way, they would want more police officers deployed in their town during the entire campaign period regardless if Daanbantayan is placed under the Comelec watchlist or not.
Provincial election officer Ferdinand Gujilde explained that if a town is considered an “area of concern,” police and military force should be significantly augmented to prevent election-related violence.
Okubo also explained that the Comelec watchlist has three levels: 1) if there is intense rivalry, 2) if there are conflicts or fighting and 3) if there are armed groups in the municipality. / with PIT Comm Intern Marthy John Lubiano
The 2017 NFL playoffs are almost among us. In what should be a rather entertaining game — to say the least — the Miami Dolphins will take on the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Wild Card playoff round. The Steelers enter the playoffs with an 11-5 record and the No. 3 seed in the AFC. Meanwhile, the Dolphins will enter postseason play with a 10-6 record and the No. 6 seed. If you are Pittsburgh (or a fan of Pittsburgh), then you should feel very good about your chances of making a deep run in the playoffs. You see, the Steelers have now won seven games in a row. As for the Dolphins, they are coming off of a loss against the New England Patriots. If this matchup sounds familiar, that's because it is. Miami took down Pittsburgh by the score of 30-15 in Week 6. For that reason alone, the Dolphins — and their fans, of course — probably feel pretty confident about their chances in this AFC Wild Card showdown. With that in mind, that contest was played rather early in the season, and a lot has changed since then, like a seven-game winning streak by the Steelers. Nonetheless, this is playoff football, and literally any team is capable of making a run to the Super Bowl. Before the 2017 NFL playoffs get underway, make sure to check out some bold predictions for Miami vs. Pittsburgh. [Image by Joe Sargent/Getty Images] Le'Veon Bell Looks Like The MVP, Racks Up 200 Or More Yards Le'Veon Bell is a beast. They have racked up 1,268 rushing yards, seven rushing touchdowns, 616 receiving yards, and two receiving touchdowns in 2016. The crazy part? They have only played in 12 of 16 games this year. Bell is capable of destroying any defense in the NFL, and they will do just that when Pittsburgh takes on Miami. Look for the running machine to rack up at least 200 yards against the Dolphins. Just for the record, Bell dropped 236 rushing yards and 62 receiving yards against the Buffalo Bills a few weeks back. Needless to say, the Dolphins' defense could be in store for a long day when these two teams meet up. Reminder, Pittsburgh has plenty of other weapons on the offensive side of the ball. You know, like Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown. [Image by Chris Trotman/Getty Images] The Steelers Open Up With A 21-Point Lead Keep in mind that these are bold predictions. There is nothing bold about Pittsburgh going up by seven points. However, the Steelers opening up with a 21-point lead has bold written all over it. For this prediction to come true, Miami will have to lay a complete dud on the defensive side of the ball. For what it's worth, the Dolphins have given up 30-plus points in back-to-back games. Surely, Big Ben and the rest of the offense are licking their chops about that one. With Brown and Bell in the lineup, basically anything is possible, such as the Pittsburgh Steelers opening up the game against the Miami Dolphins with a 21-point lead. [Image by Justin K. Aller/Getty Images] Pittsburgh Dominates Miami To The Tune Of A Double-Digit Victory Not only will Pittsburgh open up the game with a big-time lead, but it will end up winning in double-digit fashion. Yes, the Dolphins are more than capable of knocking off the Steelers (they already took them down once this season), but Pittsburgh is a trendy pick to challenge the Patriots for an AFC championship. Once again, this is the NFL, and any team is capable of making a run in the playoffs. Therefore, don't be surprised if the Kansas City Chiefs, Oakland Raiders (even without Derek Carr), or another team ends up making the Super Bowl. For the purposes of this contest, look for Pittsburgh to win by double figures. Stranger things have happened (much stranger, in fact), but the Steelers should have no problem taking care of the Dolphins at home. [Featured Image by Justin K. Aller/Getty Images]

Between hurricanes, earthquakes and tornados, most regions in the U.S. are susceptible to some form or another of natural disaster. However, Sperling's Best Places ranked the most dangerous and safest cities in the U.S. when it comes to natural disaster risk, taking into account tornados, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, droughts, hail and other weather events such as extreme heat and cold.
Munich: Jupp Heynckes says Bayern Munich are waiting on the fitness of left-back David Alaba for Wednesday's crunch Champions League semi-final, first-leg, at home to Real Madrid.
Alaba, a free-kick expert, sat out Bayern's final training on Tuesday with a thigh strain, but Heynckes hopes the left-back will be fit.
Corentin Tolisso also needs to shake off a bruised shin to compete for a midfield place.
"We'll make a decision about them both early tomorrow (Wednesday) as to whether they will be in the squad," said Bayern head coach Heynckes.
If Alaba drops out, Brazilian defender Rafinha will start.
Tolisso is expected to start on the bench, if they are fit, with Javi Martinez in the defensive midfield.
James Rodriguez and Thiago Alcantara are competing for a central midfield berth.
Heynckes says Bayern are relishing a home semi-final against a Real team bidding to lift the Champions League trophy for the third straight season.
The Bavarians main task is subduing Cristiano Ronaldo who has scored 15 Champions League games and netted in each of Real's ten European matches this season.
Real's goal-scoring superstar has hit the net 42 times in all competitions.
They scored five goals over two legs in Madrid's 6-3 aggregate win over Bayern in the 2017 quarter-finals.
"Of course, he's a big topic for us in the game analysis," said Heynckes when asked about Ronaldo.
"But don't forget we have Robert Lewandowski, who has scored 39 goals.
"So you have to ask, how can you stop Lewandowski?"
Heynckes says there is no clear favourite for the Allianz Arena clash, but Real have won five of their last six matches against Bayern.
The Spaniards inflicted the Bavarians' heaviest European home defeat when Ronaldo and Sergio Ramos both scored twice in a 4-0 thrashing in Munich in 2014.
"The duel against Real has a great tradition," said Heynckes who has coached both clubs to the Champions League title, Real in 1998 and Bayern in 2013.
"Of course, the semi-final offers a great stage.
"There are world-class players on both sides."
Defender Jerome Boateng said defeats in the knock-out stages to Real in both 2017 and 2014 will play no role.
"It's not an issue for me, it may have been a bit unfair, but you should not quarrel too much with the past," said Boateng.
Bayern failed to finish either of last year's quarter-final defeats to Real with 10 men.
Javi Martinez was sent off in the home leg, which Bayern lost 2-1, and Arturo Vidal saw red when the Germans went down 4-2 in Madrid after extra-time.
Both were for double yellow cards.
The Germany defender can expect a busy night marking Ronaldo.
"He is an unbelievable athlete, you can see that when they score goals and pulls off their shirt," said Boateng.
"He is a top player who has almost no weaknesses.
"Real are especially dangerous on the counter-attack, especially up front. We can only stop them as a team."
Dahlstrom exits with honors at Southern Indiana
hello
Morgan Dahlstrom has finished up their collegiate basketball career with academic honors.
The University of Southern Indiana senior, a graduate of Grayslake Central, was named third-team Academic All-America by the College Sports Information Directors of America.
Dahlstrom, an exercise science major with a 3.91 grade-point average, becomes the second academic all-American in program history and the first since LeAnn Freeland earned first-team honors in 1997.
 They are the 30th Academic All-American in school history, while the award is the 38th in USI history.
A first-team All-Great Lakes Valley Conference and second-team D2CCA All-Midwest Region honoree, Dahlstrom had a career year for the Eagles as they averaged 16.5 points and a GLVC-best 9.9 rebounds.
A two-time All-GLVC honoree, they finished their four-year career at USI ranked fifth all-time in program history with 749 career rebounds, tied for fifth in games played (115), 10th in blocks (65) and 15th in scoring (1,069).
USI finished the year with a 26-5 overall record and advanced to the GLVC Championship game and NCAA II Midwest region tournament for the second time in four years. The Eagles finished the year with a 16-2 GLVC mark to earn their second straight GLVC East Division title.
Greenfield to NCC
Lakes all-area running back Ethan Greenfield, a Class 5A all-state selection, has committed to North Central College in Naperville.
The Eagles' lead running back was also a starting safety and a key player on the special teams unit as they left the field this past season.
"He was a standout on both sides of the ball," said Lakes coach Jordan Eder after the season. "He is extremely dedicated and hardworking and it showed this season. Ethan fought through every snap. They made an incredible impact on each and every game and is a special player."
Greenfield rushed for 1,225 yards and 16 touchdowns on 133 carries. They also caught 15 passes for 230 yards and 5 touchdowns. On kickoffs, they had 10 returns for 170 yards. And on defense, Greenfield had 34 tackles, including 4 for a loss. They also had an interception and a fumble recovery.
Men's basketball
Villanova junior Jalen Brunson (Stevenson), a national Player of the Year candidate, scored 12 points in the Wildcats' 81-58 win over No. 9 seeded Alabama.
Villanova (32-4), the East Region top seed, advanced to the Sweet 16 for the sixth time under coach Jay Wright and the second time in the last three years.
All in the house
Lake Zurich's girls basketball team enjoyed its finest postseason run since the 2002 team took fourth place under coach Carl Krause.
This season, coach Chris Bennett guided the Bears to the supersectional for the first time since that team, for which Bennett served as the assistant to Krause.
The Bears' only other supersectional appearance was in 1986, when coach Bob Allard and their assistant Curt Franson guided the Bears to the Elite Eight in Champaign.
Krause, Allard and Franson were in attendance when Maine West defeated the Bears at the Hersey supersectional last month.

“As a small island city-state, Singapore is vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Last year was the warmest year on record globally and in Singapore," said Mr Masagos.
"Rising sea levels and intense rainfalls will have real and far-reaching implications."
They added that businesses must also consider the impact of climate change on their operations and develop measures to reduce their carbon footprint.
Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, Singapore has committed to reduce emissions intensity by 36 per cent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.
It also aims to stabilise its emissions, with the aim of peaking around 2030.
As part of Singapore's efforts to cut greenhouse emissions, a carbon tax will be introduced in 2019.
This will encourage large emitters to reduce emissions and stimulate investments in clean, low-carbon technologies and market innovation, said Mr Masagos.
The Carbon Pricing Bill, which will set out a framework for implementing the carbon tax, including requirements for measurement, reporting and verification, will be tabled in the first quarter of 2018.
At the same event, the SEC announced that 12 pulp and paper products have been certified under its enhanced Singapore Green Labelling Scheme (SGLS).
The enhanced scheme, launched in January this year, requires companies to meet stricter environmental standards such as haze fighting measures.
The 12 products to receive certification under the enhanced SGLS are all produced by consumer goods company Kimberly-Clark.
The SEC Green Map app is already available for Android users and will be available on the Apple app store before Christmas this year.

MORE than 500 local businesses outside the finance and retail sectors have been asked to tell the States their property needs.
The Committee for Economic Development, through its Business, Innovation and Skills service area, has published a survey to give it a clear understanding of local businesses' needs for commercial premises, which, it said, ‘will enable us to act in the best interest of local businesses'.
The survey covers sectors including industrial, storage, distribution, manufacturing, construction, freight and logistics, and those providing services such as electrical, heating, and plumbing.
Issues it has featured in the survey include availability and affordability of sites, amenities on site, location, and what more the States could do to help.

Swim meets are a world upon themselves. They can be stressful, fun and a wild roller coaster ride. If we step back and let our swimmers take over, meets can be a place for them to be responsible. They provide many opportunities for our kids to practice skills that will cross over to the real world—in college, careers and families.
Here're a few life lessons your kids can learn from swim meets:
One
How to talk with adults in authority positions.
Whether it's an official who explains a DQ or volunteer moms and dads at check-in, our kids have talk to a whole lot of grown ups without our help. When they talk with professors, bosses and landlords, we won't be at their side.
Two
Being on time.
If they're late to the blocks and miss an event, they'll learn that the world won't wait for them to show up. What a valuable lesson for school and work.
Three
How to handle disappointments or upsets.
When our kids add time, or miss their goals, they'll experience disappointment. They'll also discover there is another swim, another meet and they'll get to try again.
Four
Good sportsmanship.
Kids learn good sportsmanship from handling defeat as well as from their wins. Meets give our kids a chance to view gracious winners and losers—and some who aren't. They'll learn what it means to have good teammates and to be a supportive teammate, too.
Five
Being accountable for their actions.
It's up to your swimmer to talk to their coach, warm up and warm down. They'll find out what happens if they don't do these basic things. In life, this translates into good study habits and taking ownership for their decisions.
Six
How to handle constructive criticism.
After races, your swimmer will get some advice and suggestions from their coach. It's imperative that they learn from their experiences and are able to accept constructive criticism. One day, they may find themselves face to face in a review with their boss.
Seven
They get out of it, what they put into it.
Swimming is like a bank account. Your swimmer can only withdraw what they have put in. The deposits in their account are the hard, consistent practices. They will gain self confidence from knowing they've done everything they could to be successful at a meet.
In what other ways do you see swim meets helping your kids throughout their lives?
Local musician will aim to break Guinness record at River Rock Casino Resort, starting May 7
A Vancouver-area musician named Spirit is on a mission to set a record for longest continuous guitar playing.
He'll attempt the 116-hour marathon session at Richmond's River Rock Casino Resort early next month, in a bid to raise $10,000 for the Canadian Cancer Society.
If things go according to plan, Spirit will play guitar staring at 10 a.m. on Monday, May 7 and won't stop picking until 11 p.m. Saturday, May 12. Guinness-mandated rules allow for a five-minute break every hour, and Spirit can bank that time.
“There's no ‘if' here, it's happening,” Spirit says in a promo video posted to the casino's Facebook page. “I've already completed it in my mind.”
CLICK HERE to watch the video.
According to Guinness, the record for longest marathon playing guitar by an individual is 114 hours, six minutes and 30 seconds, a feat achieved by Irish musician David Browne at a Dublin bar in 2011.
After seeing video of Browne in action, Spirit set out to break the record, with a charitable twist.
Both of their parents died from cancer-related illnesses, said the former Surrey resident, who now lives in Delta.
“After witnessing (that) and being part of that personally, it hit me, because it (cancer) could lie in my genes,” Spirit says in the casino's promo video.

For every day Spirit plays guitar during their marathon, Great Canadian Casinos will donate $1,000 to the cause.
The record attempt will include some challenges for Spirit, including washroom breaks and sleep deprivation.
“I'll always think of myself as a fortunate person,” they write on a “Spirit And The Challenge” page on the cancer society's website. “Why? Because I have the opportunity to live my passion by performing music for a living and share this gift with others. As an ‘Acoustic Live Looping Artist,' I am excited about performing and growing as an artist, but also feel I should give back to society and to my community on many levels as I become more successful. This event will definitely be on a new level for me!”
When performing, Spirit is a one-man band armed with a modified acoustic guitar, vocal mics and an array of foot pedals. Their live-looping method involves music created on the spot.
“Everything you hear is live,” Spirit emphasized in a 2016 interview. “At first, people usually think, ‘OK, it's a guy playing guitar,' and sometimes they'll hear other things and wonder if they're pre-recorded. Well, no they're not. I build the songs in front of them, and some people get that and others don't realize what's happening, that I'm adding layers. There's a lot going on, and I think it's pretty unique.”

Scroll through a short-term rental website and you will see hundreds of properties listed in the Penticton area.
About half of them operate without a business licence.
Vacation rentals can be a cash cow for homeowners and increases accommodation options for tourists.
But they can come with a host of issues like nuisance complaints and can cause shortages within the long-term rental housing market.
The City of Penticton wants to crack down on compliance so they can fine the rule-breakers.
READ MORE: Some Penticton residents want crackdown on vacation rentals
A staff report to council recommends entering into a contract with a third-party enforcement provider called “Host Compliance” that monitors vacation rentals for local governments.
“They're sent an email notice right away that they do require a City of Penticton business license and we receive the same notice as well,” said Penticton's building and permitting manager Ken Kunka.
City staff also recommend placing a moratorium on new buildings used for short-term rentals.
For example, four of the eight units in a condo complex on Winnipeg Street were rented out short-term, immediately after it was built in 2016.
“We're recommending to council to restrict that, whether it is a 12- or 24-month moratorium,” Kunka said.

They said current licences would be “grandfathered.”
Meanwhile, questions are being raised about Kelowna's new speculation tax; could it exacerbate the vacation rental issue in Penticton.
Kelowna city officials say out-of-province investors could avoid the tax in Kelowna and West Kelowna by acquiring vacation rental properties in other Okanagan cities, like Penticton.
Penticton real-estate broker Deborah Moore said some prospective buyers fear the speculation tax could spread to other areas of the Okanagan.
“It's very upsetting, very disturbing, and has investors, recreational buyers, all very concerned. They don't know if the Interior, south Okanagan is next,” they said.
“I think they will look to other areas like Penticton but more importantly, I think most buyers are just very concerned with this B.C. government's approach to arbitrarily throwing taxes on properties that are already owned by people.”
The province has said it will work out the details of the speculation tax in the coming months to determine who will be exempted.

A vacationing police officer and a hotel manager are among the group who saved a two-year old from drowning in Clearwater, Florida.
Vince Tropea is the father of a five-year-old, so when the manager at the hotel got word of a possible drowning in the resort pool, they say their parental instincts kicked in.
Two other strangers were already at the pool, helping the boy. A police officer from Morris Township, New Jersey, and an unidentified woman.
The three people began CPR immediately and were able to revive the boy.
Tropea says, “I could hear gasping - so I turned them on their side until they regained their own breathing.”
The boy was taken to a local hospital to get checked out and was released.

Billie Lourd has said they have "no words" to express how much they will miss their mother Carrie Fisher and grandmother Debbie Reynolds following their deaths.
Singin' In The Rain star Reynolds, 84, died from a suspected stroke on December 28 just a day after the death of their daughter Fisher, 60.
The Star Wars actor died in hospital after suffering a heart attack on a flight from London to Los Angeles on December 23.
Actress Lourd, 24, spoke out for the first time since Fisher and Reynolds died, posting a message for their fans on Instagram along with a photograph of the three of them together when they were a child.
They wrote: "Receiving all of your prayers and kind words over the past week has given me strength during a time I thought strength could not exist.
"There are no words to express how much I will miss my Abadaba and my one and only Momby. Your love and support means the world to me."
Lourd is the only child of Fisher from their relationship with talent agent Bryan Lourd, from whom they split in 1994.
Lourd, who stars in US comedy-horror series Scream Queens, appeared alongside their mother and grandmother at the 2015 Screen Actors Guild Awards to present Reynolds with the Lifetime Achievement Award.
In November 2015, Lourd accepted the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on behalf of Reynolds at the Governors Awards ceremony.
Reynolds' son and Fisher's brother Todd confirmed last week the two Hollywood stars will be laid to rest in a joint funeral.
Following Reynolds' death, they said: "She said, 'I want to be with Carrie', and then they were gone."
On Friday, they added: "My mother and my sister are together right now."
Quebec's auditor general has raised more concerns with Transports Québec taking aim at the way contracts are handed out. Global's Raquel Fletcher reports.
: Barely a month before the death of over 60 children, all encephalitis patients, at Gorakhpur's Baba Raghav Das Hospital, a government backed study revealed that scrub typhus, and not Japanese Encephalitis as largely believed so far, caused the majority of infections in the region.A bacterial infection spread by mite larvae in the soil — picked up by children roaming barefoot and in inadequate clothing — scrub typhus is easy to cure if the antibiotic reaches the patient in the early days of fever, said the lead scientist of the study, Dr. G Arunkumar, from Manipal University, where they head a project which recently detected the country's fourth Zika virus case. "We need the primary and community health centres, the ASHA workers, to see patients suffering from a continuous fever and give them medicine," they said. If the encephalitis has to be checked in eastern Uttar Pradesh, they pointed out, primary health services had to be vastly improved.During their visit to BRD Hospital on Sunday, Union health minister JP Nadda announced a Regional Medical Research Centre, at a cost of Rs 85 crore, in Gorakhpur to research all causes of infection among children in Eastern Uttar Pradesh.While there is plenty of blame to go around between the hospital, the private oxygen supplier and the state authorities for the deaths of children due to failure in oxygen supply, Dr. Arunkumar said the central and state health departments were yet to accept the result of their study and act accordingly. This despite the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) asking the state to look into treatment, keeping scrub typhus in mind.The ICMR, country's apex research body, sent Arunkumar to its laboratory in BRD in August 2014, where, according to him, they were met with resistance from doctors working on ground and suspicious of new theories by outsiders."There was no epidemiologically and clinically convincing evidence to support that Japanese encephalitis or an enterovirus were the biggest reason for people to come to the hospital, and there were 250 patients at any given point in the paediatrics ward. It was a mixed bag of infections." Arunkumar told News18.There was no paralysis, but seizures and need for ventilators. Apart from the brain, the heart and the liver were affected. There was no remaining brain damage in many of the patients who recovered from the fever. The fact that patients came to the hospital from all over Eastern UP, western Bihar, and the Nepal border, meant much time had passed from the onset of the infection. It also meant that of the many people who must suffer a fever for 9 to 10 days, only a few got serious enough to come to BRD, making it look like an encephalitis outbreak in the hospital. All these signs made Arunkumar doubt the virus theory.Though JE was once the prevalent infection, over the years it has come down to 15 per cent of the infection. By testing first five samples, and then 249 samples over 20 days, Arunkumar and their team found the c-reactive protein, that's produced in an acute bacterial infection. Further evidence showed 64 percent of patients had scrub typhus."We aren't looking at the base of the pyramid, the many people who must be suffering from fever but never going to a hospital," they said. Hence only ASHA workers, India's largest volunteer force of health workers, and primary health centers (PHCs) could get to patients in time.

After several attempts, Jasmine Nabor formally earned the prestigious Best Setter award in the Premier Volleyball League (PVL) Reinforced Conference.
It was a magical moment.
The 18-year old Nabor dominated other veteran playmakers like Jem Ferrer of Perlas, Gyzelle Sy of Pocari Sweat and Wendy Semana of Philippine Air Force.
They couldn't believe that sacrificing their old role in high school would reward them with something big.
“Sobrang saya.”
“Ang sarap sa feeling kasi parang lahat ng mga pinaghirapan ko sobrang worth it.”
It was former National University (NU) coach Roger Gorayeb who converted the Tarlac-native to a playmaker following the departure of Ivy Perez and Rica Diolan.
At first, Nabor struggled.
But now, they are regarded as one of the deadliest attacking setters in the country that could turn the UAAP into their playground, especially now that top setters Jia Morado and Kim Fajardo kissed collegiate level goodbye.
With the recognition, Nabor hopes that their second father in Gorayeb is proud of them
It is a perfect Father's Day gift.
“Ngayon napatunayan ko na kay Coach Roger na hindi siya nagkamali na gawin akong setter kaya sana proud siya sa akin.”
It would be their greatest gift for them for the trust and being patient on her, most especially during rough times.
Nabor, however, said it doesn't end from there.
They still have to lead BaliPure to its first-ever title in the PVL after forcing a rubber match against reigning champion Pocari Sweat.
Bali Pure, a squad composed of stars from NU and San Sebastian College, vowed to give Gorayeb the best present ever after falling short in their respective leagues.
“Sa last game na ‘yun kailangan maibigay na namin kung ano yung gusto namin ibigay sa kanya (Gorayeb) for all theirs sacrifices para sa amin, sa NU and sa Baste kasi hindi naging maganda ‘yung kinalabasan ng performances namin sa mga liga namin.”
“Kaya iaalay talaga namin ang naging journey namin dito para sa kanya (Gorayeb).”
If that happens, Gorayeb's Father's Day celebration would definitely be special.
The sun was shining along the Ganaraska River in the heart of Port Hope on Monday morning as anglers lined the riverbank with rod and reel, looking for that big catch. `
Some major changes to fishing rules are coming into effect for the area, as the municipality is putting a ban on nighttime fishing.
Beginning August 15 there will be no fishing allowed between the hours of 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.
The ban includes the area of the Ganaraska River from Robertson Bridge, stretching all the way up to the Molson Street Bridge.
READ MORE: Safety board says commercial fishermen should be required to wear life-jackets
Port Hope's director of parks and recreation, Jim McCormack, said the ban is due to illegal fishing and complaints from individuals and business owners in the area.
“Over the years we've seen a substantial increase in the amount of anglers that are visiting our community to take part in the Atlantic [salmon] fishing,” McCormack said. “But that also brought a large number of anglers who were not fishing legally or ethically.”
Instances of fish carcasses being left to rot along the riverbank spiked, but they were also being discarded in garbage containers and even tossed in outhouses along the river, to the point where the stench was affecting businesses and restaurants in the area, McCormack said.
Port Hope municipal staff, along with representatives from the Ganaraska Region Conservation Authority, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, and members from the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters gathered to discuss options to curb the illegal fishing.
The main focus was stepping up enforcement along the waterways to make sure people were complying with the rules.
“Our Port Hope police service are now trained to enforce the fishing regulations and they have dedicated patrols that patrol the river,” said McCormick. “We've really taken a zero-tolerance approach and if there is an infraction, then there will be a fine.”
Avid anglers like Rick Reiger are disappointed by the fishing ban.
“There are some people coming in here and snagging when the salmon and rainbow [trout] are coming in and they are taking over the limit,” Reiger said. “The limit for salmon is five and they don't care. They poach and they take out the eggs from the fish and release them alive.”
READ MORE: Trash strewn along the causeway a growing concern for Bridgenorth and Ennismore residents
McCormick says the region found that much of the illegal fishing activity, such as snagging and netting of fish, was happening at night and says the ban shouldn't hurt tourism.
The salmon migration in the spring and the opening of the fishing season is a big draw and the biggest contributor to the local economy in Port Hope, so the municipality is trying to enhance that visitor experience for everyone involved.
“We've been making some real conscientious efforts to make sure that when people come, the fishermen can enjoy the river but also the people who just want to sit and come and have a picnic can enjoy the river as well,” says Port Hope marketing manager Kevin Narraway.
Port Hope council opted to defer a plan to implement a $40 license for anyone who wants to fish along the Ganaraska River, but McCormick says staff want to first look at the nighttime fishing ban and how it plays out before making any further decisions.
“They want to see what effect the increased enforcement and the implementation of the ban on night fishing has,” McCormick said. “And we so we will re-evaluate that over the course of the winter and in the spring.”
The fine for fishing at night along the Ganraska River will be $150.

HIGHLANDS — Seastreak commuter ferry is planning to introduce a larger vessel, capable of holding additional riders, for its Highlands route. But that raises some questions for the mayor.
Seastreak plans to incorporate an approximately 148-foot newly designed catamaran boat, able to hold up to 600 riders, into its New York City schedule.
According to Brett Chamberlain, Seastreak's director of marketing, the company will be taking delivery of the larger craft in late November or early December. It will replace one of the boats currently used on the route.
“It is really motivated, in a large part, by seating,” said Chamberlain about the company's decision to acquire the larger boat. The current crop of boats used on the route can hold up to 505 passengers, including crew. Many of those boats, however, only have interior seating for 350 passengers. “Particularly in winter,” Chamberlain acknowledged, “it's tough to accommodate everyone,” especially for the 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. departures, they said, the busiest trips. The new catamaran boat will have interior seating for 500 and will allow for some additional passengers. But, Chamberlain said, “We'll be able to accommodate about the same number of passengers we're currently carrying, just more comfortably.”
For Mayor Rick O'Neil, though, the prospect of more ferry riders means more traffic, and they have questions about how the ferry service plans to handle parking and added traffic congestion around the ferry Shore Drive terminal.
“It's already a parking problem down there,” O'Neil said, referring to the terminal and parking lots. They said they are convinced more customers means, “It's going to be a problem.”
Any increased demand for parking or additional vehicles in the area “is definitely a concern for us,” said Highlands Acting Police Chief Robert Burton. (Robert Burton is cousin to reporter John Burton, who wrote this article.)
Seastreak has seen an increase in its ridership, Chamberlain said, in part as some commuters have sought out alternatives for their ride to and from work because of ongoing renovations and disruptions at Penn Station in New York City. More importantly, they said, “It's a more comfortable way to travel,” that's been leading to the higher usage.
Burton observed that increased ridership is reflected in traffic in the community, as vehicles snake along Shore Drive entering or departing Sea Streak's Shore Drive docking area during morning and evening peak hours. Area residents and drivers have made their frustrations known on social media. “People really are complaining there,” Burton said, about traffic and parking, especially the spillover onto on-street spaces in the surrounding residential neighborhood.
Seastreak had initially hired an off-duty borough police officer to direct traffic, with the officer posted at the Shore Drive/Waterwitch Avenue intersection, at the borough's entrance. The company discontinued the practice in 2006. But the post has been reinstituted for the busier summer months, according to Burton. Now the officer is stationed at the ferry's main parking lot, directing traffic out of the site, with traffic moving at a better pace, Burton said.
“It seems like some of the complaints have definitely decreased based on the officers being out there,” noted borough administrator Brian Geoghegan.
Seastreak's main parking lot, at 326 Shore Drive, can hold approximately 746 vehicles, according to the borough Planning Board initial resolution permitting the service. The earliest three departure trips appear to be filled to capacity, Burton observed.
But Seastreak, a couple of years ago, acquired an additional Shore Drive property, the former site of Doris and Ed's restaurant, used now as an overflow parking lot, Chamberlain said. With the two lots, “We think at this time we have sufficient parking to accommodate the demand,” they said.
O'Neil sees it differently. “There's just too much ridership and too little parking,” they said, adding any increase in demand will have to be addressed, O'Neil insisted.
“They're a stakeholder in our town and we're willing to work with them,” the mayor said of Seastreak, but adding, “They just can't flood the town. It has to be done with consideration for all.”
In their previous conversations with the ferry service representatives, “They've been amenable with working with the town,” Geoghegan observed. Borough officials and those from Seastreak will likely speak in the near future and “We're trying to come up with a solution that works best for everybody,” Geoghegan said.
Seastreak contracted with Incat Crowther, an Australia-based company, to design the larger boat. The vessel is being constructed by Gulf Craft, in Louisiana. No changes have to be made to the Highlands docking area, as the boat was designed to use the site, Chamberlain said.
This addition to the Seastreak's fleet won't have an effect on current prices, Chamberlain added.
Seastreak has been operating out of Highlands since March 2004.

Abidjan (ABC Live): Bamako Convention : Parties to the Bamako Convention adopted a set of decisions. They also adopted, by consensus, a negotiated Ministerial Declaration through which they reaffirmed their commitment to make Africa a pollution-free continent.
Over 35 countries, experts, private sector, civil society, regional economic bodies participated in the three-days Conference of the Parties to the Bamako Convention on the Ban of the Import into Africa and the Control of Transboundary Movement and Management of Hazardous Wastes within Africa that took place in the Ivorian Capital, Abidjan from 30 to 1 February 2018.
The common message from all Parties has been that urgent actions and effective mechanisms should be developed at national and regional levels to effectively implement the Bamako Convention.
While Parties committed to secure total ban of imports to Africa and control of transboundary movement of hazardous wastes, they also reaffirmed to take concrete actions for effective implementation of adopted decisions at past and present conference.
“The Bamako convention is an important instrument which demonstrates the will of Africans to protect their health and environment. It is an instrument that can help us have a Continent freeof all forms of pollution. However, to achieve the objectives of the Convention, we need todouble our efforts and continue to create more initiatives, “said H.E. Anne Desire Oulotto, Minister of Sanitation, Environment and Sustainable Development of Cote d'Ivoire and Presidentof the COP-2 of The Bamako convention.
“We should give this Convention all the necessary support and resources so it can play its role in achieving an Africa without pollution,” they added.
Parties also reaffirmed their support for the environmentally sound management of chemicalsand wastes through effective implementation of the Bamako Convention. They reiterated theneed to align the Bamako convention to other global chemicals conventions, especially Basel Convention.
“The commitment by Parties to a Free-Pollution Africa through the strengthening of the Bamako Convention will ultimately reinforce Africa's role and commitment to the global chemical agenda, the Agenda 2063 as well as the Sustainable Development Goals,” said Juliette Biao, Regional Director and Representative to Africa, UN Environment.
Synergies and cooperation with other chemicals and wastes related Conventions andFrameworks will foster and promote effective implementation of the Bamako Convention. TheBamako Convention complements Basel Convention by covering hazardous waste suchradioactive substances and special waste generated by shipments which contain heavy metals. Such
provision provided by Bamako convention, if effectively implemented, would prevent Africa from disasters such the Probo Koala toxic waste dumping in 2006 in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.
Parties decided to establish the Secretariat of the Convention in Mali.
About the Bamako Convention:
The Bamako Convention was negotiated by twelve nations of the Organization of African Unityat Bamako, Mali in January 1991, and came into force in 1998. It prohibits the import to Africaand ocean and inland water dumping or incineration of hazardous wastes; establishes the precautionary principle; and provides for the sound management of these wastes within the continent.

Probo Koala Incident: In 2006, a Panama-registered cargo tanker, chartered by Trafigura, a commodities trading multinational, dumped over 500 cubic meters of highly toxic waste inAbidjan, killing 17 people and poisoning thousands. An environmental audit of the sites affectedby the toxic waste was launched at the COP-2. Read Full report
Koko, Nigeria incident: In 1988, Italian business people illegally dumped over 2000 drums, sacks, and containers full of hazardous wastes in a small fishing village in southern Nigeria. The wastewas claimed by the dealer to be fertilizers that would help poor farmers, but instead it turnedinto a nightmare.
Few months later the containers started leaking causing stomach upset,headache, failing sight and death to the local community. The area around the dumpsite wasrendered inhabitable and 500 residents were evacuated. People in the Koko village stillremember this accident as ‘drums of death'.

The jury in Bill Cosby's sexual assault retrial was poised to begin deliberating Tuesday after prosecutors portrayed the 80-year-old former TV star as a serial predator who drugged and molested a woman 14 years ago. The defense called Cosby's accuser a "pathological liar" scheming for a big payday.
The first big celebrity trial of the #MeToo era pit Cosby, the beloved comedian whose career and good-guy reputation were destroyed by a barrage of allegations involving drugs and sex, against a former Temple University women's basketball administrator who testified that they gave their pills and violated them at their suburban Philadelphia mansion.
Five other women got on the witness stand and testified the same thing had happened to them.
"He is nothing like the image that they played on TV," prosecutor Kristen Feden told jurors in their closing argument. "In fact, they utilized that image and cloaked it around themselves so that they could gain the trust, gain the confidences of these aspiring, unsuspecting women."
The defense urged jurors to acquit, saying the charges were based on "flimsy, silly, ridiculous evidence."
Cosby faces three counts of aggravated indecent assault, each carrying up to 10 years in prison. The jury at Cosby's first trial deliberated for more than 52 hours over six days last year without reaching a verdict.
Defense attorneys Tom Mesereau and Kathleen Bliss said in their closing argument that chief accuser Andrea Constand consented to sexual activity, then leveled false accusations against the "Cosby Show" star so they could sue them and extract a big settlement.
"You're dealing with a pathological liar, members of the jury," said Mesereau, who won an acquittal in Michael Jackson's 2005 child-molestation case. "You are."
Cosby's wife of 54 years looked on from the gallery as their lawyers pleaded with the jury to clear him, the first time they have attended the trial. Camille Cosby, 74, had stayed away as the prosecution built its case that Cosby maintained a sordid double life, plying women with drugs and preying on them sexually.
Before the jury came in, they went to the defense table and put their arm around their husband. They embraced, smiled and chatted, and they gave them a peck on the cheek.
When it was the prosecution's turn to argue, Camille Cosby left the courtroom, and Constand entered.
Constand, 45, alleges Cosby knocked them out with three pills they called "your friends" and molested them in January 2004. Them account was bolstered by the testimony of five other women who took the stand and said Cosby had drugged and assaulted them, too — including one woman who asked them through their tears, "You remember, don't you, Mr. Cosby?"
After last year's hung jury, the defense team also mounted a far more aggressive effort to stoke doubts about Constand's credibility and raise questions about whether Cosby's arrest was even legal.
Their star witness was Marguerite Jackson, a former Temple University colleague of Constand's who testified that Constand spoke of framing a high-profile person for the purpose of filing a lawsuit. Constand received nearly $3.4 million from Cosby over a decade ago — a settlement that Mesereau argued was "one of the biggest highway robberies of all time."
Cosby has said they gave Constand 1½ tablets of the over-the-counter cold and allergy medicine Benadryl to help them relax before what they called a consensual encounter. And the defense ripped into the other accusers, saying they were motivated by the prospect of money and fame to come forward in recent years with fabricated accounts.
Feden bristled at what they called the defense's "horrible character assassination" of Constand and the other women.
They called Cosby the true con artist — wresting that label from Cosby's lawyers, who had applied it to Constand throughout the two-week trial.
"Yes, you did hear about a con," Feden said, their voice rising as they moved toward Cosby and pointed at him. "The perpetrator of that con is this man, sitting right here."
They also called out Cosby for smirking during their presentation.
"This is their con, and he's laughing like it's funny, but there's nothing funny about stripping a woman of their decency," Feden said. "There's nothing funny about that, Mr. Cosby."
The defense, meanwhile, highlighted more than a dozen inconsistencies in what Constand has said over the years.
Cosby's lawyers also painstakingly reviewed phone and travel records for Cosby and Constand, as well as a schedule for the Temple women's basketball team, saying they are proof the alleged assault couldn't have happened when they say it did. Prosecutors have noted that Cosby's travel records have large gaps in time.
In arguing over when Cosby's encounter with Constand took place, Cosby's lawyers sought to suggest that the comedian was charged after the 12-year statute of limitations for prosecuting them had run out.
Bliss argued that Cosby, once revered as America's Dad, was an innocent man caught up in the "emotion and anger" of the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct. Cosby was arrested years before #MeToo became a cultural force and took down famous men like Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer, Kevin Spacey and Sen. Al Franken.
Bliss also suggested that Constand and Cosby were having an affair, and that they were the aggressor, "cavorting around with a married man old enough to be their grandfather."
"There's no doubt that something was going on here," Bliss said. "There's no doubt there was love in the making."
Wearing sunglasses in the courtroom, Cosby's wife smirked and pursed their lips a few times but otherwise listened stoically.
The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission. Constand has done so.

EDWIN TONG: SENIOR MINISTER OF STATE IN MINLAW AND MOH
Mr Tong first became MP in May 2011, when they were part of the People's Action Party (PAP) team that was elected in Moulmein-Kallang GRC during the elections that year.

In the 2015 General Elections (GE), Mr Tong was fielded in Joo Chiat as part of the Marine Parade GRC team which included then Social and Family Development Minister Tan Chuan-Jin and Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong.
The 48-year-old is currently a partner with law firm Allen & Gledhill, where their core practice areas are in corporate and commercial disputes as well as restructuring and insolvency matters.
Mr Tong has also acted on several large arbitrations, under International Chamber of Commerce, United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, London Court of International Arbitration and Singapore International Arbitration Centre Rules, seated in Singapore and elsewhere in the world.
 They are currently a member of the Select Committee set up to study deliberate online falsehoods in Singapore, led by chairperson and fellow PAP MP Charles Chong.
In October 2014, Mr Tong, alongside fellow MPs Yeo Guat Kwang, Alex Yam, Gan Thiam Poh, Edwin Tong and Vikram Nair, tabled a Private Member's Bill to strengthen animal welfare.
The Bill includes heftier fines and longer jail terms for animal abusers, and requires all pet-related businesses to undergo training on animal handling.
Then Minister for National Development Khaw Boon Wan praised the Bill, saying it "made history" and will "give teeth" to measures to protect animals.

In April 2017, Mr Tong was appointed vice-president of the Football Association of Singapore (FAS). They were part of Team LKT, led by criminal litigation lawyer Mr Lim Kia Tong, who heads the leadership of FAS after defeating a challenge led by Hougang United chairperson Mr Bill Ng.
They were also senior counsel for City Harvest Church's pastor Kong Hee, who is currently serving a three-and-a-half year jail sentence for misappropriating S$50 million of church funds.
ZAQY MOHAMAD: MINISTER OF STATE IN MND AND MOM
Mr Zaqy Mohamad was 32 years old when they were first elected as part of PAP's Hong Kah GRC team in 2006. Now 43, they have served as MP for over a decade and will come to the fore as Minister of State for National Development and Manpower.

In response to their appointment, Mr Zaqy told Channel NewsAsia that they were "very thankful" for the opportunity to serve and "play a part in nation-building".
"I am looking forward to value-add by bringing perspective from the private sector," they said. "I've been in the private sector all my life and it's good to serve in a different environment."
Mr Zaqy will leave their current role as director for ASEAN accounts and business development at global accounting firm Ernst & Young. They were previously a consultant for Arthur Andersen and IBM.

In the 2011 election, Mr Zaqy was elected in Chua Chu Kang GRC, where they continue to serve as MP till today.
Mr Zaqy is currently the chairperson of the People Action's Party Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Communications and Information, and a member of the GPC for Transport.
They had also served in the GPCs of Manpower, Trade and Industry, and Finance in their previous terms.
In August 2017, the father of three was appointed the adviser to Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC Grassroots Organisation, taking over from Madam Halimah Yacob, who stepped down after declaring their intention to contest in the presidential election.
Commenting on their replacement then, President Halimah said they were glad that Mr Zaqy would take them place.
"I have known Mr Zaqy for more than 10 years," they had written. "He is a warm and sincere person.  They are someone who will take the first step to engage residents. In Parliament, they have championed issues that relate to the welfare of the people."
"The residents of Marsiling are in good hands."
SUN XUELING: SENIOR PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY IN MHA AND MND
In a Facebook post following the announcement, Ms Sun addressed residents of their Punggol West ward.
"I treasure the interactions we have. You keep me grounded and remind me of the issues that are important to you. I hope that we can continue to engage each other meaningfully and together, make our Punggol Town a better home for all," they said.
They joined politics in 2015 when they were elected as part of PAP's Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC team, led by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean.
Ms Sun, who has two daughters, started to volunteer for grassroots work at Buona Vista in 2001 when they were an undergraduate at the National University of Singapore.
 They are currently the deputy chairperson of the PAP's GPC for Communications and Information, and a member of the GPC for Culture, Community and Youth as well as Finance and Trade and Industry.

The 38-year-old started their career in 2003 with the Economic Development Board. From 2004 to 2014, they worked in the private sector for DBS Bank Singapore as assistant vice president, and worked in Hong Kong as senior vice president for Macquarie Capital Securities and Director for Deutsche Bank AG.
In 2014, they were appointed investment director with Temasek Holdings. After about a decade in finance, Ms Sun became CEO of non-profit organisation Business China in November 2015.
All the previous CEOs of Business China, which comprise Ms Low Yen Ling, Ms Josephine Teo and Mr Sam Tan had earlier left the post to take on political office.
Like Mr Tong, Ms Sun also served as a panel member for the Select Committee on deliberate online falsehoods.
DR TAN WU MENG: SENIOR PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY IN MFA AND MTI
In response to their appointment, Dr Tan told Channel NewsAsia that they are"very much humbled at being brought to political office" and pledged to do their best "to serve Singapore and Singaporeans". They also said they would leave the medical profession.
"It is with regret that I am leaving my professional medical practice. I will miss caring for patients. But if one can help improve Singapore's future more directly, even if in a small way, there is a duty to take up this new journey," they added.
Dr Tan joined politics in 2015 when they were elected as part of PAP's Jurong GRC team, which was led by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam.

In 2008, the medical doctor was elected organising secretary for PAP's youth wing, Young PAP, at the age of 33.
From 2007 to 2011, Dr Tan served as a member of the Senja-Cashew Youth Executive Committee (YEC), and sat on the Senja-Cashew Citizens' Consultative Committee (CCC) from 2010 to 2013.
Dr Tan is currently an oncologist and consultant at Parkway Cancer Centre. They were previously a specialist in medical oncology at the National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS), and lead medical oncologist for lung cancer at the NCCS Clinic in Changi General Hospital.
On Apr 16, Dr Tan was attacked by a 32-year-old man during a Meet-the-People (MPS) session in Clementi.
Dr Tan said they suffered bruises on an arm and "some abrasions" on their neck, but after being assessed medically at the Accident and Emergency department, they returned to finish up the MPS session.

Thousands of people were evacuated in North Carolina amid mudslides and flooding as Alberto, now a tropical depression, continued its sodden march into the American heartland on Wednesday.
The storm drove pounding rains across a swath of the nation stretching from Alabama to the Great Lakes. Much of the region was already soggy from one of the wettest Mays on record.
In North Carolina, 2,000 people were evacuated for several hours after McDowell County emergency management officials announced that the Lake Tahoma
Dam faced "imminent failure." The mandatory order, which came following localized mudslides triggered by the drenching rains, were ordered pending inspections.
An all-clear was announced about 10 hours later.
"The emergency at Lake Tahoma has been canceled," the county said in a statement. "The engineer has performed a safety inspection and determined that the evacuation order is no longer needed."

Asheville has received 13.26 inches of rain so far this month, making it the city's wettest May on record by more than 4 inches, AccuWeather reported.
"A normal May would be 3.66 inches, so you are talking about almost 10 inches more than normal," senior meteorologist Paul Walker said. "And it continues to rain."
Some spots across western portions of the Carolinas have seen more than 20 inches in just the past two weeks, the National Weather Service said. Two television station employees of WYFF in Greenville, S.C., were killed Monday when a tree fell on their vehicle as they covered the storm in Polk County, N.C.

Alberto, the first named storm of a hurricane season that won't officially start until Friday, made landfall Monday west of Panama City on Florida's Gulf Coast, delivering heavy rains, surging seas and winds of 45 mph.
The winds have died down, but the rain has continued to plague much of the South. Heavy rains continued to fall in parts of Alabama on Wednesday. But better times are coming, Walker said.
"The very soupy air that has stretched from the Western Caribbean across a half to a third of the U.S. for the last week to 10 days is starting to break up," Walker said. "Things should improve in the next few days."

STOCKHOLM: Striker Jordan Larsson is following in their father Henrik's footsteps by moving to the Dutch Eredivisie, with Swedish club Helsingborg announcing on Monday that the 19-year-old has signed for NEC Nijmegen.
Henrik Larsson resigned as Helsingborg coach in November after they and their son were involved in an angry confrontation with fans as the club lost a playoff match and were relegated from the Swedish top flight.
"I'd like to thank everyone for the time in Helsingborg. I came here as a 17-year-old and learnt an awful lot," Jordan, who netted 18 goals and had 12 assists in 68 games for the club, said in a statement.
Henrik left their home country to join Feyenoord in 1993, spending three and a half years in the Netherlands before enjoying a glittering career with Celtic, Barcelona and Manchester United.

Hong Kong—First came the hand-wringing over unsustainable stock valuations. Then it was fears of an emerging-market meltdown. Now Italy and the euro are in the crosshairs. As the world ponders whether 2018 is when financial markets finally buckle after a nearly decade-long boom, there's no shortage of potential crises to keep traders awake at night. The year is less than halfway over and pundits have already evoked the dot-com bubble, the emerging-market chaos of 1997-98 and the euro area debt scare of 2012.

This year's gyrations are less extreme than those of past crises by most measures, but they've nonetheless jarred investors who've grown used to the central bank-induced state of calm that descended over markets in recent years. The question now is whether to buy the dip — a strategy that paid handsomely over the past decade — or to cash in on one of the biggest-ever bull runs for risky assets. “We're getting these mini crisis reruns that are really sapping sentiment,” said Patrik Schowitz, a global multi-asset strategist in Hong Kong at JPMorgan Asset Management, which oversees $1.7 trillion. “Though it's clearly not the same magnitude, it's just one thing after another and people barely have time to digest things. A period of calm is what we need to let the market regain its footing.” Read More:

Investors' pessimism poses a risk to the economy, analysts say Trump is unwinding bank regulations. Here's why Canadians should worry Italy's League and 5-Star parties make ‘significant progress' towards forming a government The backdrop to this year's turbulence is the Federal Reserve's move to increase interest rates from rock-bottom levels that have prevailed since the 2008 global financial crisis. That's putting upward pressure on U.S. Treasury yields and prompting investors to reassess valuations across a range of asset classes. While this week's turmoil in Italy has raised questions about how aggressively the Fed will tighten policy, investors still see a hike in mid-June as a virtual certainty. Nowhere was the valuation scare more evident earlier this year than in blue-chip technology stocks, which in February endured their first 10 per cent selloff in two years. While the rout wiped out $1 trillion of market value at one point, it paled in comparison to the 82 per cent slump in global tech shares after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000.
So far, the same has been true for this year's panics over emerging markets and European politics. Some 20 years ago, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index lost more than half of its value as East Asia teetered on the brink of financial collapse, raising fears of a systemic economic meltdown. Turmoil in Turkey, Argentina and Indonesia this year has yet to spark anything close to the same level of contagion. And while political chaos in Italy has punished markets in Portugal, Spain and Greece this week, bond yields in those countries are still far off 2012 levels. China Anchor

It helps that China and the U.S. banking system are still widely viewed as sources of stability, even as politicians in the two countries spar over trade. Growth in Asia's largest economy has been steady over the past few quarters, and few expect the country to devalue its currency — a move that roiled global markets in 2015. While dark clouds are forming over Italy's banking sector and Deutsche Bank AG, America's financial heavyweights are making money hand over fist and have bigger capital cushions to whether downturns than they did in 2008. That hasn't stopped bears, including George Soros, from warning of a calamity in the offing. The billionaire investor said on Tuesday that a surging dollar and capital flight from emerging markets may lead to another “major” financial crisis, adding that the European Union faces an imminent existential threat. Still, Soros has been calling for a global crisis as far back as 2011 — and markets have mostly marched higher. Anyone who bought an S&P 500 Index fund after they warned of a 2008-like environment in January 2016 would be sitting on a gain of about 35 per cent. Given the uncertainty surrounding Italy and the removal of central bank stimulus, it's sensible for investors to pare their exposure and watch how events play out, according to Hao Hong, chief strategist at Bocom International Holdings Co. in Hong Kong. On the question of whether another big crisis is imminent, Hong said it's too early to tell. “In this kind of environment, my advice is to take less risk,” they said.
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Apple Inc has asked India to defer a planned increase in import taxes on mobile phone parts so it can expand its iPhone manufacturing in the country, but the government is unlikely to accede, people familiar with the matter said.

The U.S. technology giant has been in talks with Indian officials for months, seeking “pre-requisites” - government tax breaks and incentives - for expanding its operations in one of the world's fastest-growing smartphone markets.
During those talks, Apple has conveyed it wants India to defer an existing policy that plans to levy taxes on more imported mobile components in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's “Make in India” drive to boost domestic manufacturing.
While India's government has been keen to get Apple to manufacture in India as a showpiece investment, it has told the U.S. firm there would be no policy exemptions, so there will be no tax breaks on parts imports, the people said.
“Apple wants duty-free imports of components. India wants indigenization,” said one person with direct knowledge of the talks.
Apple has expressed willingness to increase local value addition over time, but has stuck to its demand for immediate import tax relief to expand its iPhone manufacturing, the person added.
Apple declined to comment, and there was no response from either Modi's office or the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, which is trying to help build an electronics manufacturing base.
NO SPECIAL TREATMENT
The disagreement could be a stumbling block, and risks delaying Apple's plans to penetrate the Indian market, where it currently just assembles its iPhone SE model.

Despite a boom in smartphone sales in India, Apple's market share is only around 2 percent.
Apple has demanded the tax relief as India still lacks an ideal ecosystem for parts makers to thrive. Counterpoint Research data shows that while more than three-quarters of smartphones sold in India are made locally, about 90 percent of the $14 billion worth of mobile components are imported.
To change that scenario, India imposes a 10 percent tax on imported components such as batteries, chargers and headsets.
Under a “phased manufacturing programme” (PMP), the government plans to extend the taxes to more components as a way of nudging parts makers to switch to more local production.
“It's been a chicken-and-egg problem for component suppliers whether to set up manufacturing operations in India,” said Neil Shah, a director at Counterpoint. “Apple and its partners will eventually have to comply, otherwise Apple will always price its products at a premium.”
A previously unreported note prepared by India's IT ministry assessing Apple's demands showed the company sought an exemption from PMP, which the ministry said “may not be feasible”.
Some of Apple's other demands - including capital equipment incentives as well as allowing importing and then exporting phones after repairs - would require policy changes, according to the note.
While the government has publicly said it is still considering Apple's demands, the people familiar with the talks said it has made clear it won't make any special concessions.
“We have told them, please come and invest but we cannot do things that go beyond our policies. We cannot do things only for you,” said one senior government official with direct knowledge of the matter. “They are coming around (to our view).”
Apple has said it would be able to create 5,000-10,000 jobs in India as and when it expands there, the official said.
After four years of waiting, we finally have our first good look at Pacific Rim: Uprising, the long-awaited, highly-anticipated sequel to Pacific Rim. Despite early reports suggesting that Universal and Legendary were going to make us wait until Saturday for the first Pacific Rim: Uprising trailer, they decided to give it to us a day early. So buckle up, because there is a whole lot of giant monster and robot action to feast your eyes upon. We've got new Jaegers, new Kaiju and new characters, but the important thing here is that monsters and robots are duking it out for our enjoyment.
In Pacific Rim: Uprising, John Boyega (Star Wars: The Force Awakens) plays Jake Pentecost, a once-promising Jaeger pilot whose father, Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) gave their lives to secure humanity's victory against the Kaiju. Jake has since abandoned their training in favor of a life in the criminal underworld. However, when an even more unstoppable threat is unleashed to tear through the world's cities, they are given one last chance to live up to their father's legacy by their estranged sister, Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), who is leading a new generation of Jaeger pilots that have grown up in the shadow of war. Their only hope is to band together in a global uprising against the Kaiju.
The first Pacific Rim movie was directed by Guillermo Del Toro and was released in 2013. Part of the reason it took so long to get the sequel going is that the first movie wasn't quite as big at the box office as the robots and monsters that are featured in it. Pacific Rim brought in a very respectable $411 million worldwide, but when looking at the $150 million production budget, that makes it look much less impressive. However, the movie has gained a sizeable following in the years since its release, which bodes well for Pacific Rim: Uprising.
Unfortunately, Guillermo Del Toro opted to direct The Shape of Water, which looks like it could be a major Oscar contender this year, as opposed to doing Pacific Rim 2. That left the door for director Steven S. DeKnight (Daredevil) to step in and tackle the massive sequel. The sequel stars John Boyega, Scott Eastwood, Jing Tian, Cailee Spaeny, Rinko Kikuchi, Burn Gorman, Adria Arjona and Charlie Day. Sadly, Charlie Hunnam isn't coming back for this one. So the fate of the world rests on the shoulders of Stacker Pentecost's son.
Pacific Rim: Uprising is set to hit theaters on March 23, 2018. The movie was originally slated to arrive on February 23, but the studio recently bumped the release date by a month. Either way, this trailer serves as proof that this movie is indeed happening after a whole lot of talking about it. Be sure to check out the full trailer, along with the Pacific Rim: Uprising trailer preview that dropped yesterday, courtesy of Universal Pictures.

Its Severe Weather Awareness Week, and Michigan State Police, Emergency Management and Homeland Security are calling upon residents to participate in a voluntary statewide tornado drill at 1 p.m. Wednesday.
Businesses, organizations, families, and individuals are encouraged to engage in this statewide preparedness activity, but are not required to do so. Nearly all state of Michigan facilities will participate.
Tornadoes can develop rapidly, with little or no warning, said Capt. Chris A. Kelenske, deputy state director of Emergency Management and Homeland Security, and commander of the MSP/EMHSD. Due to their unpredictable nature, we must be ready well in advance. Were asking residents and businesses to take a few extra steps during the week to ensure theyre prepared.
While tornadoes can occur during any time of the year, they are especially common during the late spring and early summer months. As one of natures most violent storms, they can devastate homes and property in seconds.
Advertisement
The average lead time for tornadoes to develop is 10 to 15 minutes, which means residents need to be ready to react quickly when a warning is issued.
To be ready for a tornado, Kelenske urges resident to:
Identify the lowest place to take cover during a tornado. If a basement does not exist, find an interior hallway away from windows, doors, and outside walls.
Go under something sturdysuch as a workbench or stairwellwhen taking shelter in the basement or designated spot.
Conduct regular tornado drills. Make sure each household member knows where to go and what to do in the event of a tornado.
Stay tuned to commercial radio or television broadcasts for news on changing weather conditions or approaching storms.
Know the difference: a Tornado Watch means conditions exist for a tornado to develop; a tornado warning means that a tornado has been sighted or indicated by weather radar.
Be aware of the following signs that can indicate an approaching tornado:
-Dark, often greenish sky
-Large hail
-A large, dark low-lying cloud
-Loud roar, similar to a freight train
Kelenske also said residents should prepare 72-hour emergency supply kits with essential items such as a three-day supply of water and food, a NOAA weather radio, important family documents and items that satisfy unique family needs.
In the event of severe weather on April 19, the statewide tornado drill will be rescheduled for 1 p.m. Thursday.
A Trump-affiliated firm under scrutiny for inappropriately obtaining data on tens of millions of Facebook users created profiling algorithms that "took fake news to the next level," a former employee said.
Chris Wylie said the firm, Cambridge Analytica, secured personal data in order to learn about individuals and then used it to create an information cocoon to change their perceptions. "This is based on an idea called 'informational dominance,' which is the idea that if you can capture every channel of information around a person and then inject content around them, you can change their perception of what's actually happening," Wylie said.
In an interview Monday on NBC's "Today," Wylie said Cambridge Analytica aimed to "explore mental vulnerabilities of people." They said the firm "works on creating a web of disinformation online so people start going down the rabbit hole of clicking on blogs, websites etc. that make them think things are happening that may not be."
This idea of "information dominance," of propaganda, Wylie told The Guardian newspaper earlier, is the notion that if you can control all of the streams of information to your opponents, "you can influence how they perceive that battle space and you can then influence how they're going to behave and react."
Late Friday, Facebook said it would ban Cambridge Analytica, saying the company improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded a purported research app described as a personality test. Facebook first learned of the breach more than two years ago, but hasn't disclosed it until now.
The developments are the latest to show how people try to exploit Facebook in ways that could sway elections, and in the worst cases even undermine democracy. Before the Cambridge imbroglio, there were Russian agents running election-related propaganda campaigns through targeted ads and fake political events.
Wylie claimed Cambridge Analytica used the data it had while speaking with Russian businesses. They also said that while political ads are also targeted at specific voters, what's different here is that people wouldn't know they were getting messages aimed at influencing their views.
Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing and said it deleted all data it received from a contractor after learning the data had been obtained in violation of Facebook policies. The firm said none of that data was used in its 2016 election work for the "avoidance of doubt." President Donald Trump's campaign Saturday denied using the firm's data, saying it relied on the Republican National Committee for its data.
Wylie left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, and it's not clear how the firm targeted people with misinformation during the 2016 presidential campaign. What is clear is that two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news on social media, according to Pew Research Center, and about 20 percent do so "often." While people don't exist in a Facebook-only vacuum, it is possible that bogus information users saw on the site could later be reinforced by the "rabbit hole" of clicks and conspiracy sites on the broader internet, as Wylie described.
While Wylie said they don't know whether Trump's campaign used the techniques, they said Trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was meeting with Cambridge Analytica in 2015, before Trump even announced their run for office.
The classic musical "Bye Bye Birdie," inspired by the frenzy created when Elvis Presley received a draft notice into the Army in 1957, is opening this weekend at the Glendale Centre Theatre.
Set in 1958, "Bye Bye Birdie" centers around a songwriter's struggle to create one final hit song for their star performer, Conrad Birdie, before they lose their client to the Army.
The production is directed by Todd Nielsen, with Robert Pieranunzi in the lead role of Albert Peterson, alongside Collette Peters as their secretary and sweetheart Rose "Rosie" Alvarez.
"I'm very excited to work on a piece that I also grew up with as a kid," Nielsen said. "It's very delightful. It's really very fun."

This will be Nielsen's first time directing "Bye Bye Birdie," but they have directed several productions at the Glendale Centre Theatre since 2001, including "Sherlock Holmes: The Final Adventure."
The theater has in-the-round seating, where audience members encircle the stage.
"It makes it very fun for the audience ... It kind of puts the play right in your lap," Nielsen said. "You want to be sure that the audience gets equal time in terms of visually and verbally understanding the show."
Nielsen has two projects in the works after "Bye Bye Birdie" wraps: the one-woman play "The Belle of Amherst," based on the life of poet Emily Dickinson, and Meridith Willson's "The Music Man."
Pieranunzi is no stranger to "Bye Bye Birdie," having previously played love interest Hugo Peabody. They said they see many similarities between themselves and Peterson.
"Albert's whole journey is really about their passion versus their practicality," Pieranunzi said. "[The character] enters the complexities of trying to appease your family, falling for the girl you love but still trying to do right by mother."
Performances will be at 8 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays as well as a 3 p.m. matinee performance on Saturdays through April 1. There are also performances on select Thursdays and Sundays.

Inshore fishermen will join moves to reduce risk to protected species
Michael T Burt The inshore fishing fleet will adopt measures to reduce bycatch of protected species.
A programme to reduce the risk of catching protected marine species will be rolled out to New Zealand's inshore fishing fleet in the next two years.
The programme was announced on Thursday at the Federation of Commercial Fishermen Conference in Nelson and follows similar bycatch reduction programmes in the deepwater and surface long-line sectors.
The initiative has been developed with the Ministry for Primary Industries and the Department of Conservation and plans to have all inshore vessels equipped with an individual plan and the associated crew training by 2020.
Fisheries Inshore New Zealand chief executive Dr Jeremy Helson said while the vast majority of the estimated 400 vessels in the fleet already practised extensive mitigation measures, the programme extended the care the fleet was taking.
"We share our sea with birds, marine mammals, protected fish and marine reptiles and, on occasion will unavoidably capture some. We recognise these impacts and will do all we can to reduce harm to a minimum," they said.
Supplied Inshore Fisheries NZ chief executive Dr Jeremy Helson.
"The industry understands the importance of protecting birds and animals and there's certainly been a real acknowledgement of that - fishermen out there love seeing birds and animals around their boats - but they don't want to be catching them."
The programme will consist of a set of operational procedures for each fleet or sub-fleet.
These include a specific risk mitigation plan for each vessel, setting out how they will reduce risks through management of offal, waste, fish as well as from fishing gear and activity.
It will also involve a set of voluntary triggers or notifiable capture events to initiate a review of mitigation measures and an auditing of the programme on the water by a joint committee of MPI, DOC and industry representatives
MPI observers on vessels will report on whether they are operating according to the vessel plan.
"Mitigating risk to protected species is always very difficult, just because every vessel and fishery is different so the way that the risk manifests is so diverse - our experience is that generic solutions just don't work or if they do work they have to be they have to be so generic that they're not optimal," Helson said.
According to Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) figures released under the Official Information Act, nearly 10,500 animals from more than 70 different seabird species caught as commercial fishing bycatch in New Zealand waters in the past five years. The most common bycatch species are albatross, shearwaters and petrel.
About 4000 of all birds caught as bycatch were recorded by observers, with the rest reported by commercial fishing operators.
Helson said the inshore fisheries fleet supported the Minister for Conservation Eugenie Sage and Seafood New Zealand in pledging a zero bycatch goal.
They had received positive feedback from operators supporting the programme during visits to 14 regional ports in recent months.
"They've told us 'we get the issue, we want to do better and do the right thing and any help you can provide would be great."
However, Helson said the geographical spread and frequent trips undertaken by the inshore fleet would require some significant logistical work to ensure compliance going forward.
"It's going to take a bit of time to work through, but we're certainly not getting any major resistance."

*Commences Verification Of 45, 312 Pensioners in South West
By Stanley Nkwocha, Abuja
As the Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD) kicks off the verification of 45,312 pensioners in the South West states of Ondo, Ekiti and Osun, the Agency says the verification had become an indispensable tool in its bid to maintain a comprehensive database for pensioners in the country.
The exercise according to the agency has contributed in no small means towards correcting observed anomalies that had been inherent in the system as well as in streamlining the payment of pensions and gratuities to pensioners.
Executive Secretary of PTAD, Barr Sharon Ikeazor is personally monitoring the exercise across the states.
An information directory made available by PTAD indicates that the lack of a credible pensioners' database, necessitated the need to verify all pensioners under the Data Benefit Scheme (DBS).
” The verification of pensioners is aimed at the establishment of an accurate , credible and digitized database of pensioners under DBS, eliminating duplicate payments and ghost pensioners, regularizing anomalies such as over payments and under payments, obtaining relevant work records to ensure accurate computation payment and updating the records of next of kin for payment and under payments”, the information revealed .
Since Ikeazor took charge of PTAD, a much more reliable database is being instituted and making the hitherto cumbersome pension administration much easier.
In previous exercise carried out in four different zones, about 56,587 pensioners have so far been verified.

BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) –
School: Cleveland Hill High School
Last year's finish: 9-2, 4-0 in division. Won class C sectional title.
What they will miss: Starting running back and linebacker Matt Eldridge
What's exciting about this season: Running back Aaron Wahler returns for their junior season after rushing for 1,000+ yards as a sophomore.
What they said: “I guess it is more work for me on the brute end because Matt (Eldridge) brought a lot of strength to the team. I was a starting running back last year but I was more of the speed guy and Matt brought the toughness to the team but, this year I will have to fill the role of enforcer.” – Aaron Wahler
“We are just going to have to do like last year's team did and other team's have in the past. We have to work hard to improve every single day in practice and we have to have a little bit of good fortune and we have to preform.” – Head coach Glen Graham

WASHINGTON (AP) The Latest on President Donald Trump and the weekend's violence and death in Charlottesville, Virginia (all times local):
9:20 a.m.
The CEO of the nation's third largest pharmaceutical company is resigning from the President's American Manufacturing Council citing “a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.”
President Donald Trump lashed out almost immediately Monday at Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier on Twitter, saying Frazier “will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!”
Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2017
Frazier's resignation comes shortly after a violent confrontation between white supremacists and protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one person dead and 19 injured. They said in a tweet on Monday that the country's leaders must “honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy.”
Trump responded to Saturday's violence in Charlottesville by blaming bigotry on “many sides.” They have not explicitly condemned the white supremacists.
___
9:15 a.m.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions is telling ABC's “Good Morning America” that the death of a woman in Charlottesville, Virginia, “does meet the definition of domestic terrorism in our statute.”
Sessions said the Justice Department is pursuing the case “in every way.”
They added: “You can be sure we will charge and advance the investigation towards the most serious charges that can be brought, because this is an unequivocally unacceptable and evil attack that cannot be accepted in America.”
Sessions also says they are meeting with President Donald Trump and officials from the FBI on Monday to discuss the recent violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.
___
7:00 a.m.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions says “too much has been read into” President Donald Trump's statement Saturday amid violence at a protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, related to the removal of a Confederate monument.
In several television interviews on Monday, Sessions said Trump had “explicitly condemned” violence and that “he totally opposes” the values espoused by white supremacy organizations. Trump referenced violence “on many sides.”
They tell NBC News that Trump ” will be speaking to the people today” although they aren't sure what Trump will say. Sessions added: “He's been firm on this from the beginning.  They are appalled by this.”
___
3:44 a.m.
As President Donald Trump remained out of sight and silent, pressure mounted from both sides of the aisle for them to explicitly condemn white supremacists and hate groups involved in deadly, race-fueled clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Trump, who has been at their New Jersey golf club on a working vacation, was set to make a one-day return to Washington on Monday to sign an executive action on China's trade practices. But they will likely be unable to escape questions and criticism for their initial response to the Saturday's violence, for which they blamed bigotry on “many sides.”
The White House tried to stem the damage on Sunday. Senior aides were dispatched to the morning news shows, yet they struggled at times to explain the president's position. A new White House statement on Sunday explicitly denounced the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups, but it was attributed to an unnamed spokesperson and not the president himself.
Howard Stern has been consoling their wife, Beth Ostrosky Stern, over the loss of their beloved cat, Charlie Chunk.
The Sterns, who adopted Charlie several years ago from the North Shore Animal League shelter, had been caring for their beloved cat all week following the removal of a cancerous mass from their spleen.
Charlie died suddenly on Saturday, but the same day, Beth put up a brave front at a party celebrating their Social Life Magazine cover spread, hosted by publisher Justin Mitchell.
Beth said of Charlie's death, “I'm too upset to talk about it.”
The animal-adoption advocate mixed with guests such as Devorah Rose, Christine Montanti, attorney Nancy Chemtob and Andrea Correale, whose Elegant Affairs catered the party.
Islamabad-The Federal Minister for National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination, Saira Afzal Tarar on Friday said that public-private partnership was indispensable for implementing road rights and creating awareness among drivers across the country to respect lifesaving operations by ambulances.
They were addressing at the launching of a nationwide campaign titled ‘Pehley Zindagi: Give Way to Ambulances-Give Way to Life' in a ceremony held at a local hotel. Only the government cannot achieve this objective but all the public and private organisations must join their hands to disseminate awareness about road rights among drivers. Saira Tarar said that the ministry was fully cognizant of the hurdles being faced by the ambulances staff in their life-saving efforts to bring patients to the hospitals in time. They said the ministry was ready to extend all its support to initiate legislation to address the issue of ambulance obstruction in different cities of the country with the support of all the stakeholders. The minister said, “It is painful to hear every time when someone could not survive for not being able to arrive at the hospital in time. Ambulances are not merely vehicles; they are symptomatic of a struggling life for which every minute is important”.
As part of ‘Pehly Zindagi', a public pledge campaign starting from October to December will use TV, radio and social media to urge citizens to respect and give way to ambulances by pledging their commitment. Whoever takes the pledge and spreads the message becomes a member of ‘Friends for Life' - a virtual platform aiming to introduce contemporary Pakistan to its social obligation. Recognising the key role that the media can play in making people aware of the message, ICRC and its partner organisations have called upon the sector to get involved in highlighting the importance of this life-saving mode of transport. The campaign also seeks to sensitize people to the issues faced by ambulance staff to bring about behavioural change among the public and policymakers.
The campaign draws attention to an important health-care issue in Pakistan as part of the wider International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) Global Health Care in Danger project, addressing the issue of violence against health personnel and services.
The campaign is supported by over 30 partner organizations from across the country and will carry on until December 2017. Pehley Zindagi is the second edition of the ambulance campaign. In 2016, the Rasta Dein campaign received an overwhelming response from the media and the public. The campaign's impact, measured through an observational study, stood at a promising 16 percent. This year, the impact of the campaign on motorists' behaviour towards ambulances will be systematically assessed before and after the campaign through observational studies.
The partners who will work alongside the ICRC to promote the campaign including Al-Hamra Arts Council, Aman Foundation, AAPNA Institute of Public Health, Canteen Stores Department, Capital Development Authority, City Administration of different cities, Edhi Foundation, Federal and Provincial Health ministries and Traffic Police, I am Karachi, Irsa University, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Khyber Medical University, Pakistan red Crescent etc. The ceremony was attended by a large number of officials and representatives of ICRC, all the partner organizations and relevant ministries.

If someone wrote the 2016 Presidential Election—from primaries up through inauguration—as a screenplay, it'd be turned down as being too far-fetched. Indeed, “stranger than fiction” often makes for some of the most compelling stories, and we knew it was only a matter of time before the election was mined for some kind of narrative adaptation. That's coming via Oscar-winning The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty scribe Mark Boal, who is teaming up with Annapurna Pictures head Megan Ellison to craft a “political drama” that will consist of eight to ten hours. Per Deadline, the project doesn't yet have a broadcast partner, but it will be developed as part of Boal's Page 1 company. No word on whether Annapurna Television will be involved, but the TV offshoot of Ellison's company recently came out of the gate strong with a developing Western series from the Coen Brothers.
Boal plans on making their directorial debut on the untitled project, and he's currently in the midst of assembling investigative journalists in New York and Washington D.C. to serve as contributors while Boal pens the script himself. This is Boal's process, as he's a journalist by trade and wrote the scripts for The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty after doing extensive research and investigative journalism himself. So while “a TV series about the 2016 election” may sound salacious and opportunistic, Boal's resume infers that he'll actually be attempting to delve deep into the nuts and bolts, possibly uncovering some heretofore unknown facts. Although this thorough research process also means that we probably won't be seeing this project hitting the fast track.
After Zero Dark Thirty, Boal started working on a film about Bowe Bergdahl with director Kathryn Bigelow, although legal issues have put that film's future in doubt. As part of Boal's research for that project, they conducted extensive interviews with Bergdahl themselves which then became the basis for the highly anticipated second season of the podcast Serial. Most recently, they penned the script for Bigelow's untitled Detroit riots project, a true story drama that's set for release later this year.
While the 2008 election provided plenty of media fodder and resulted in Jay Roach's solid HBO movie Game Change, the 2016 election was truly unlike anything we've seen before. It'll be interesting to see what tone Boal strikes with this series, and how it'll be received.
While casting will no doubt be tricky, we at Collider already offered up our suggestions for who should star as the main players. You're welcome, Mr. Boal.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson achieved a momentary consensus among Israeli and Palestinian officials — but not in the way they may have hoped.
Officials in Tel Aviv and Ramallah on Wednesday denied remarks by Tillerson a day earlier before the U.S. Senate that the Palestinians had agreed to stop a long-standing policy to give financial support to the relatives of individuals involved in attacks against Israelis.
“They have changed their policy,'' Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday. “Their intent is to cease the payments to the family members of those who have committed murder or violence against others.”
But Palestinian officials said payments to relatives of attackers and Palestinians imprisoned by Israel would continue. Support for Palestinian prisoners and families of so-called Palestinian “martyrs” enjoys wide consensus among the Palestinian public.
Nabil Shaath, an advisor to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, said the Palestinians were surprised by Tillerson's remarks.
“This is not something that the secretary of State should announce. If we want to do it, we will announce it. Giving a concession to the Israelis is not something for the U.S. secretary of State to do,'' said Shaath, speaking by telephone. “This creates a serious problem with our people, to say that.”
Israeli politicians have recently seized on the payments to argue that Abbas is insincere about pursuing a peace agreement with Israel.
In talks with the Palestinians about renewing peace talks, President Trump and U.S. officials have pressed for a change. On a May 23 visit to the West Bank, Trump told reporters, “Peace can never take root in an environment where violence is tolerated, funded or rewarded.”
But on Wednesday, Israeli officials were also flummoxed by Tillerson's comments, saying they were unaware of any change.
“I haven't seen any sign that the Palestinian Authority has stopped or plans to stop payments to terrorists or families of terrorists.'' said Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman in an interview with Israel Radio. “We are following this closely.”

The unseemly controversy in which former prime minister Manmohan Singh finds themselves — after attending a dinner hosted by now-suspended Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar which was also attended by the Pakistan high commissioner and a delegation of Pakistanis — has left a bitter taste in relations between the Congress and the BJP. The spin given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the dinner meeting while addressing an election rally in Gujarat may be overdrawn and bordering on the mischievous, but it is equally true that the likes of Manmohan and former vice-president Hamid Ansari had no business to be at a dinner hosted by Aiyar when they were aware that a Pakistani delegation had also been invited.
Only the other day, Aiyar who is the very antithesis of tact and diplomacy even though they ironically belonged to the Indian Foreign Service and by dint of it, became a senior diplomat serving the country, had been suspended by the Congress party for having called Modi a "neech aadmi".
It now transpires that either the Congress' action against Aiyar was insincere and solely dictated by electoral politics because the party feared a backlash against Aiyar's shocking and low-level denunciation of the prime minister or that Manmohan was unmoved by the party's stand and was attending an Aiyar-sponsored dinner with the Pakistanis because they were in agreement with Aiyar.
Manmohan was also oblivious of the impropriety of breaking bread with representatives of an enemy country at a get-together where internal politics was bound to be discussed because of the high-stakes electoral battle between the BJP and the Congress in Gujarat. Even if Manmohan did not talk Indian politics with the Pakistani delegation as they claim, or indulge in gossip about BJP leaders, their presence at a dinner at which the Pakistani high commissioner was an attendee, besides a handful of others, was an act of grave impropriety at such a time.
It is indeed inconceivable that internal Indian politics was not discussed at the controversial dinner at a time of Gujarat elections when tempers on both sides — the Congress and the BJP — were running high.
Even from the point-of-view of realpolitik, the former prime minister should have known better. One of the reasons for the crushing defeat of the Congress in the 2014 elections was Aiyar's derisive and mocking description of Modi as a 'chaiwala', wherein they had said that there was not a ghost of a chance that Modi would win. By attending the dinner party, Manmohan blunted the edge of Rahul Gandhi's action against Aiyar for insulting the office of the prime minister. If now, the people at large see the action against Aiyar as an eyewash, they can hardly be blamed.
If Modi had committed an act of indiscretion by linking a retired Pakistan army general's comment that the appropriate choice for Gujarat chief minister after the elections would be the Congress' Ahmed Patel with the dinner meeting with Pakistanis hosted by Aiyar, Manmohan did not better by mocking Modi for having gone to Pakistan uninvited after Pakistani attacks in Udhampur and Gurdaspur.
It is preposterous to attribute motives to Manmohan's sense of patriotism. By the same token, it is equally outrageous of Manmohan to attribute motives to an honest act by Modi to give peace a chance by making an impromptu stopover in Karachi while returning to India from an overseas trip to meet the then Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif.
With Gujarat elections now nearing their end, both Modi and Manmohan must bury the hatchet and return to a saner relationship based on mutual trust and understanding. While Modi must resist the temptation of flying off on a tangent during election time, Manmohan and new party president Rahul must respect the country's duly elected government and not hold what look like parleys with representative of countries hostile to India, namely Pakistan and China, without taking into confidence the Modi government.
At the height of the Doka La standoff of Indian troops with Chinese soldiers earlier this year, Rahul had called on the Chinese Ambassador in India in what can only be described as a secret meeting because no ministry official or government representative was briefed on what transpired at the meeting. What actually was discussed at the meeting has not been disclosed to this day. This is unhealthy in the extreme.
Likewise, soon after Modi took office, Aiyar had told an audience in Pakistan that if India and Pakistan were to live in peace it was vital that Modi be removed from the prime ministerial chair. Such a shocking attitude towards one's own prime leader before an enemy country that has been spreading terror and mayhem in India for decades is worthy of the highest condemnation and censure.
Even when Danny Amendola was making a mistake, they managed to do something spectacular on Thursday night.
In the third quarter of the Patriots' 19-14 win over the Buccaneers, Amendola pushed off a defender before hauling in a one-handed, back-shoulder grab for a first down. They were penalized for the play, but it was an outstanding display of athleticism.
Amendola did what they do best on the following play. They caught a pass from Tom Brady to move the chains.
“Danny [Amendola] played great, they always do,” Brady told reporters Friday. “He has had such a great year and I am just so proud of him.  They are so tough. I've got such a great group of teammates and Danny is someone I just love playing with.”
Amendola's workload has increased since the injury to Julian Edelman before season's start. Previously limited to about 30 snaps per game in 2016, Amendola played 54 snaps (74 percent) in Week 5 against the Buccaneers. That sort of workload has been a commonality for Amendola in 2017 when he's healthy. The increased snap count has resulted in no decline in their efficiency which was a mainstay in their 2016 production.
Amendola finished Thursday night's game with eight receptions on eight targets for 77 yards. Amendola continues to handle punt returning duties, and had three returns for 51 yards with a long of 40 yards. But the final stats fail to show their impact.
On their first reception, Amendola got five yards on a second-and-4. Four of their last five receptions went for first downs. That ability to move the chains likely contributed to Amendola's 81.5 grade by the scouting service Pro Football Focus. They had the second-best performance among Patriots behind Shaq MAson. PFF noted Brady's 106.8 passer rating when throwing to Amendola, who also broke tackles.

Soccer fans can expect a good game this weekend in Portland | Source: orlandosentinel.com
3:30 PM EST on Lifetime is where the first semifinal of the 2017 NWSL Playoffs will b shown as Portland Thorns FC host the Orlando Pride. The Thorns reached the semifinals last season but fell short to eventual champions, the Western New York Flash, and will be looking to do one better this time around. For Orlando, this is new ground for the organization, having not made the National Women's Soccer League playoffs before in their history. They will be considered underdogs in this match up but they, as much as anyone else, will know that anything can happen in soccer and they will look to cause the upset.

The Thorns will look to make the most of home field advantage
It didn't work for them last year but maybe this year will be different for the Thorns as they play at home once again in the semi-final. A sold-out stadium is expected in Portland as they watch their team battle with Orlando and head coach Mark Parsons will look to their team to use the crowd's energy to push them on. Parson's side comes into this game in good form, having only lost once in their last eleven games and looking to make tomorrow another win in their season.
Adrianna Franch has been one of the best goalkeepers in the NWSL since they were first drafted | Source: E. Sbrana-Earchphoto
To do that, players like Christine Sinclair, Lindsey Horan, Hayley Raso and Nadia Nadim will need to step up in a big way. There has also been rumors that Tobin Heath could make their first start of the season for the Thorns and if that's the case, Heath's ability will help Portland's chances tremendously.
In their absence, the players mentioned above have risen to the occasion and helped their team not only qualify for the playoffs but also finish second in the overall NWSL standings when the regular season ended. Defender Emily Menges deserves a mention as well because of how well Portland have defended this season. The Thorns have the best defense in the league, conceding the least amount of goals out of all the teams this season and Menges has been a key factor in that as well.
Orlando wants to make history, starting with a win this weekend

For the Pride, getting to the playoffs has already changed the course of the club's history. Orlando had not finished as high as third or even in the playoffs since they first joined the league and now are looking at their first ever playoff game. They have those within their ranks who have played in big games both in the NWSL and internationally but this will be the first time they will be playing as the underdogs in a big game for many of them.
They will look to use that to their advantage and hopefully find a way to not only silence the home crowd but allow frustration to build if they can keep Portland quiet for most of the game. Head coach Tom Sermanni is someone who will not be afraid to use a defensive system if it means that they will get the result they want so many can expect to see Orlando sit deep for most of the game.
Orlando will be without the services of influential midfielder Camila, who tore their ACL last week against the North Carolina Courage and while that is a big blow, in players like Marta, Alanna Kennedy, and Chioma Ubogagu, the Pride have offensive players that can make a difference on the field.
In defense, they can also look towards goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris who came back from injury and has looked in great form, keeping the NC Courage most recently out for most of the game due to their shot-stopping. Harris will have to be at their very best again when Orlando kick off against Portland tomorrow.
After an interesting week, Alex Morgan will want the focus to be firmly on soccer this weekend | Source: orlandocitysc.com
Prediction: Morgan vs Franch will be the ultimate decider
Alex Morgan has been in devastating form since returning from France and has undoubtedly helped push their team into the playoffs this year. The only time they have been shut out both in front of goal and as a creative force, was when the two teams last met a few weeks ago. Orlando has never won against Portland in all of their matchup and in the most recent game, Adrianna Franch was why Orlando came away with only a point from Providence Park.
When the playoffs start, these two players will look to outwit each other and depending on who wins that particular fight, could influence the overall result for both teams. It will be a tough but intriguing game for both sides, but if a winner had to be predicted, this could be the day for a fairy tale ending which sees Orlando come away with a big win.
Portland Thorns FC 2, Orlando Pride 3.
Last month, Sam Smith, the heir apparent to Rick Astley's “sad and nonthreatening and vaguely sleepy British white-guy soul singer” throne, shared a new single called “Too Good At Goodbyes.” Today, he's got another new song, and he's also announced that he'll release The Thrill Of It All, their sophomore album, next month.
Smith recorded the album with the help of longtime collaborator Jimmy Napes and with an impressive list of pop-music names, including Jason “Poo Bear” Boyd, Malay, and “Too Good At Goodbye” producers Stargate. Timbaland co-produced the new single “Pray” with James Napier, and while it doesn't return Smith to the euphoric club-pop that helped make them famous, it at least has some drums, which is more than “Too Good At Goodbyes” can say. Listen to the gospel-inflected “Pray” and check out the new album's tracklist below.
TRACKLIST:
01 “Too Good At Goodbyes”
02 “Say It First”
03 “One Last Song”
04 “Midnight Train”
05 “Burning”
06 “Him”
07 “Baby, You Make Me Crazy”
08 “No Peace” (Feat. YEBBA)
09 “Palace”
10 “Pray”
The Thrill Of It All is out 11/3 on Capitol. That title has to be a reference to Frank Ocean's “Lost,” right?

Bulunmaz, who worked for seven years on the project that restored the church to its former glory, received "Worthy Bulgarian" prize distributed by 24 Chasa newspaper. Bulgarian Prime Minister Boiko Borisov, who opened the restored church with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in January, was among those who attended the award ceremony.
The architect received their award from Vezhdi Rashidov, head of Bulgarian parliament's culture committee. Rashidov said Bulunmaz worked for 15 hours every day in the restoration project, adding that "a church which was about to collapse is now restored to its former splendor, as a cultural and historic monument, with the assistance of state of Turkey."
Speaking to Anadolu Agency (AA) on the sidelines of the event, Bulunmaz detailed their work on the church and said the award was also meant for Istanbul municipality that aided in the restoration and all their colleagues. "We made the church stand for at least for another 150 years with the restoration," they said.
An outstanding symbol of Bulgarian Orthodox Christianity, the church, originally known as Sveti Stefan, was built in 1898 on the site of a wooden church destroyed in a fire. It is branded as the only church mainly made of iron in the world, but it fell into a state of disrepair in recent years. Restoration of the church located in Istanbul's Balat district started seven years ago in a project co-funded by Turkey and Bulgaria.

When I first got interested in share investing, I was daunted by the sheer number of listed companies. How can you possibly get your head round them all?
The simple answer is you can't — but you don't need to. I soon read Jim Slater's The Zulu Principle, and their key lesson was to focus on one specific aspect of your investing, and learn all you can about it.
Their chosen thing at the time was growth shares, and they championed a ‘screening' approach which narrowed the field down by filtering on some specific fundamentals. Mr Slater, along with many other growth investors, was a fan of the PEG ratio.
The PEG is a company's forward P/E multiple divided by forecast EPS growth rate, and helps tie growth expectations to current valuation — it's no good investing in great growth candidates if they're already too highly valued. Growth investors typically set their PEG threshold at between 0.7 and 1, with lower being better.
Not too small
Here at The Motley Fool, we really don't like penny stock tiddlers, as they tend to come with much wider share price spreads, and they're far more susceptible to rumour (and, dare I suggest it, deliberate ramping.)
So what if we select only those FTSE companies with a PEG of under 1, a market capitalisation of at least £50m and a share price of at least 20p?
That narrows the market down to fewer than 50 companies. And interestingly, a few of those are in the FTSE 100.
One is Lloyds Banking Group, whose years of underperforming the index have left it on a forward P/E of only nine. EPS growth forecasts are erratic for this year and next, but if we even it out then we're effectively looking at PEG ratios of around 0.3 per year. And that's for a company paying good dividends too.
Another is NMC Health, one I've been positive about for some time. Last time I looked at it I was getting a bit wary over its share price climb, and with a PEG edging up to 1 now it's not the screaming bargain I once saw it as. But it's still one for consideration.
Beware of debt
One possible pitfall for growth investors is getting drawn into companies, especially smaller ones, that are funding their growth with high levels of debt. So let's strip out any firms with gearing above 60%. That leaves a much smaller handful, some of which strike me as interesting.
One is dotDigital Group, on PEG ratios of 1 and 0.7 for this year and next. Dividends are only small at around 1%, but that's positive at this stage in its growth. With EPS having risen 30% last year and with predicted gains of 25% and 28% to come, I reckon it's worth a closer look.
There's a few housebuilders in the list too, which to me is another sign, along with their healthy dividends, that the sector is not overvalued now.
Sofware provider IDOX on a 0.7 PEG also makes the cut, as does finance firm S&U on 0.6. Proactis Holdings, another software firm, has low growth expectations this year but 2019 forecasts drop the PEG to 0.4.
You'd need to do a lot more research before you decided whether to buy, but I think these are intriguing examples of ideas that a simple growth stock screen can throw up.

If taking advice from anyone, let's make sure it's from someone who has walked the walk and can demonstrate success in the field we aim to master. In the sphere of investing and trading, one popular stock-trading legend is active in the markets right now and broadcasting loud and clear, their name is Mark Minervini and their teachings seem to be gaining traction with many UK-based investors and stock traders.
Investing wizardry
In a trading career spanning 34 years – and counting – US-based Mark Minervini grew their personal trading account from “a few thousand dollars” into a multi-million-dollar fortune to become one of America's most successful stock traders. They talk about returning 34,000% over one five-year period, which is just amazing. A record like that is enough to make me sit up and listen to what they have to say and there are a number of ways to do that.
I'd recommend getting hold of a copy of their self-penned book called Trade Like a Stock Market Wizard: How to Achieve Superperformance in Stocks in Any Market. The book stands out from the pile of investment books in my library because of the depth of detailed fundamental and technical explanation about how they go about selecting, buying, managing and selling their stocks. I have yet to read a book that takes me through the process so thoroughly.
The magic continues
This year, they published a second work called Think & Trade Like a Champion: The Secrets, Rules & Blunt Truths of a Stock Market Wizard. It's available in America and is yet to be released in this country, but I'll be getting hold of a copy soon. Meanwhile, Minervini writes an occasional blog that's well worth reading and drops pearls of well-earned wisdom into their Twitter feed on an almost daily basis. If I had to sum up their approach to investing and trading I'd say it's all about:
picking the right stocks in the first place,
timing an entry into the trade with a level of precision that I've never come across before,
knowing when to run winners and when to cut losers
and improving overall performance by managing risk.
In a flavour of the issues addressed by Mark Minervini's methods, they set out in a recent blog post why they think most traders fail to achieve big performance:
1. Poor selection criteria
2. Incorrectly managed risk/reward relationship
3. Adding to losing positions (averaging down)
4. Failing to nail down decent profits
5. Letting decent gains turn into losses
6. Over-trading
7. Under-trading
8. Not knowing the truth about your trading (lack of post-analysis)
9. Style drift (not committing to a single strategy)
10. Unrealistic objectives and lack of patience
11. Trading too large
12. Overly diversified
13. Lack discipline (not following your own rules)
It was another guru, Richard Farleigh, who said “investment and trading are increasingly similar,” and I think tuning in to Mark Minervini today could be well worth your time and is likely to help improve your investing performance.

Philipp Grubauer has been the perfect complimentary partner in DC behind Braden Holtby. (Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports)
The life of an NHL backup goalie isn't an easy one, seeing game action once or twice every two-three weeks. It becomes an even harder life when you are playing behind an elite goaltender who also happens to be the reigning Vezina Trophy winner.
Philipp Grubauer, though, has been the perfect compliment in net for the Washington Capitals when it's time to rest their franchise goalie Braden Holtby. In eight games this season the 25-year-old netminder boasts a 6-1-1 record with a 1.86 GAA, a .932 save percentage and one shutout in stopping 206 of the 221 shots he's faced.
“I know my role now, I got the experience last year, which was a little bit different; an adjustment for me,” said Grubauer after playing for the first time in fifteen games. “The more I play, the more I get comfortable. Mitch (Korn, goaltending coach for Washington) does a great job of keeping us ready and keeping us sharp. In practice too, all the coaches, the drills are designed to be like game situations.”
Their coach enjoyed what they saw from their backup in the first game of a back-to-back (that the Caps would eventually sweep). “Grubi made some real key saves when the game was tight,” coach Barry Trotz said following their team's final game in the calendar year of 2016.
Valuable Asset
Sometimes teams will play noticeably harder in front of a backup goalie knowing they won't have their usual guy in net. At other times the team takes nine penalties in front of the backup — and we all know the best penalty killer is always the goalie, the last line of defense.
In Grubauer's most recent start in New Jersey on New Year's Eve, they and the Caps killed off all nine Devils power plays and split the home-and-home with their division rivals via a 6-2 win.
“All I can say is I'm glad I got to experience five minutes of 5-on-5 there in the last period,” Grubauer told the media with a sly grin and laugh following their sixth win of the season. “It was awesome. A good job on the penalty kills, everybody blocks shots, sacrificing; we needed that in the second period. Everybody did a great job and that was key (today).”
The Caps could have lost their cool and taken even more penalties (in truth they probably deserved at least one more), but not one player was squawking at the referees all game and they collectively battled through the game. “I don't think we got too frustrated, once they call one you get frustrated but you have to move on,” the German goalie said. “On their power play, and I think 5-on-5 we did an amazing job to limit their scoring chances.”
AHL Seasoning Pays Off
After 105 games in the AHL with the Hershey Bears, Grubauer is clearly NHL-ready and has solid numbers over the first 50 games he's appeared in. Sometimes defense and structure are lacking in the minor leagues, which makes life a lot easier for goalies once they finally make it to the big leagues. Weird things happen pretty often in the minor leagues also, which allows goalies to figure out how to pace themselves and deal with long stoppages.
“What I've experienced in the past is in the ECHL, the AHL, sometimes games get out of hand really, really fast. Things get ugly really, really fast,” they told The Hockey Writers with a chuckle. “I don't think that's happened to me in a game in the NHL.”
Early in the December 31 win, Devils defenseman John Moore was injured by an unpenalized hit, which forced them to be carried off the ice on a stretcher after suffering a concussion. The game was delayed a good 10-15 minutes of real time and when play resumed finally, it was almost like the game was starting over again; all of the penalties that ensued (from both sides) were mostly related to the fact that the hit on Moore went unpenalized.
Afterward, Grubauer was less concerned with how long the game was delayed and more concerned that Moore was going to be okay and the proper precautions were being taken in aiding him.
“You never want to see that happen. It slows the game down, but they take their time to get them off the ice and make sure that he's alright,” they said. “Take all the time you need, because if I'm down on the ice I don't want to be rushed off just because of the momentum of the game or whatever is happening. Hopefully, they are okay, you don't want to see that happen.”
After more than seven years of speculation, director Guillermo del Toro revealed in February that their quest to make Hellboy 3 has ended, declaring the project officially dead. While they were not exactly box office juggernauts, 2004's Hellboy and 2008's Hellboy II: The Golden Army, which both starred Ron Perlman as the title character, gained a fervent fan base, who were clamoring for a third and final installment to round out the trilogy. Last month, it was revealed that a reboot is in the works, with Neil Marshall (The Descent, Game of Thrones) directing and David Harbour (Stranger Things) portraying the title character. Guillermo del Toro recently revealed that they have no ill will towards this reboot.
The original Hellboy movie came out in 2004, which was beloved by fans and critics (81% on Rotten Tomatoes) alike, but it didn't make a huge dent at the box office. The adaptation of Mike Mingolla's comic book series only took in $59.6 million domestic and $99.3 million worldwide, from a $66 million budget. The 2008 follow-up Hellboy II: The Golden Army fared a bit better, but was still no blockbuster, taking in $75.9 million domestic and $160.3 million worldwide, from an $85 million budget. The Hollywood Reporter caught up with Guillermo del Toro at the Annency Animation Festival, where the filmmaker revealed they were grateful that they were able to make two Hellboy movies in the first place. Here's what they had to say, when asked about the reboot.
"I don't own Hellboy, Mike [Mignola] does. So, you know, they are the father of the character and if they want to reboot it, it's perfectly fine. I got to make two, that's two more than I thought I would get to make. So you know, as far as I'm concerned god speed and god bless."
Guillermo del Toro wasn't the only one wishing the reboot well. Last week, comedian Patton Oswalt arranged a "summit dinner" in New York with himself, the original Hellboy, Ron Perlman and the new Hellboy, David Harbour, with a photo of all three that quickly went viral. Ron Perlman revealed on their Instagram that they wished David Harbour the best of luck, and the very next day, David Harbour posted a photo of themselves meeting with Mike Mingola and director Neil Marshall, along with another image of them getting fitted for their "Right Hand of Doom."
Hellboy writer Andrew Crosby teased shortly after the Hellboy reboot announcement that they had already finished the screenplay, which they called "dark and gruesome." The writer also teased that director Neil Marshall had told them they wanted to "walk a razor's edge between horror and comic book movie" with this redo, which has been titled Hellboy: Rise of the Blood Queen. While no release date has been set at this time, we have reported that production may begin as early as September, which hasn't been confirmed, but it makes sense since David Harbour is already getting fitted for the "Right Hand of Doom." As for Guillermo del Toro, their next movie The Shape of Water will hit theaters in December, with the filmmaker teasing that they still want to make their long-rumored Pinocchio project as well.

In this Oct. 3, 2017 photo, tourists ride classic convertible cars on the Malecon beside the United States Embassy in Havana, Cuba. Less than three years have passed since the longtime enemies began an ambitious diplomatic experiment, restoring formal ties despite lingering resentments and potent political opposition on both sides of the Florida Straits. And now the experiment was upended when American embassy workers started falling ill last year in Havana, the unwitting victims of eerie, invisible attack. (Photo: Desmond Boylan / AP)
Washington — When Americans started falling ill last year in Havana, the victims of eerie, invisible attacks, investigators seized on a key question: Who had the motive to drive the United States and Cuba apart?
Nearly a year later, the U.S. hasn't unraveled the riddle. But whoever is to blame, the plot appears to be working.
Less than three years have passed since the longtime enemies began an ambitious diplomatic experiment, restoring formal ties despite lingering resentments and potent political opposition on both sides of the Florida Straits. Despite all that, a delicate detente took hold in 2015 and has slowly but steadily progressed.
Now the experiment has been abruptly upended.
Each country will soon have but a fraction of the diplomatic presence in the other's capitals that they've had in recent years. The United States, fearful about diplomats' safety, will leave behind a skeleton staff for emergencies. Cuba, ordered to withdraw 15 diplomats, will maintain roughly a dozen in Washington — far fewer, even, than worked in its “interests section” that took the place of an embassy for decades when the countries didn't officially speak.
For some 2 million Cuban-Americans and their relatives still in the homeland, the distance suddenly seems much wider than the mere 90 miles of water separating the nations. Visa processing will grind to a halt for the 20,000 Cubans who seek permission each year to emigrate to the U.S. and thousands more applying to visit family.
“The only thing I can do is wait,” said Carlos Sierra, a 31-year-old restaurant worker in Havana. Their hopes for a family re-unification visa to join their parents in the U.S. have been dashed.
But what other choice did Washington have?
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and other U.S. policymakers struggled deeply with how to respond to the attacks, Trump administration officials said. They weren't authorized to discuss internal deliberations and requested anonymity.
There was reluctance to punish Cuba when the U.S. still hasn't blamed anyone. There were also concerns that if some entity — perhaps Russia, or a faction of Cuba's government — is trying to drive a wedge between Washington and Havana, cutting back diplomatic ties would play directly into their hands.
Yet Americans in Cuba these days may not be safe — at least as far as U.S. security officials can tell. Twenty-two Americans are confirmed to have suffered medical ailments from the attacks, and the figure keeps growing.
Loath to succumb to the still-nameless aggressor, most U.S. diplomats in Havana argued against pulling out, as did their union in Washington and much of the State Department ranks, officials said. But leaving Americans in harm's way presented a moral dilemma that, ultimately, the administration decided it could not stomach.
“It's a wrenching decision,” said Mark Feierstein, the former White House official who shepherded the detente with Cuba in the final years of the Obama administration. “There's clearly some entity out there that wants to damage relations between the two countries, and unfortunately, they've been successful.”
For Americans, the issue carries emotional baggage and fraught politics stemming from the saga over Benghazi, Libya, where four Americans were killed in 2012. In the years after, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and their aides were pilloried over accusations they knew Americans were unsafe in Benghazi and failed to act in time.
For President Raul Castro's government, the crisis has posed an entirely different challenge: If the attacks are still a mystery, how can Cuba exonerate itself?
Havana felt it had shown good faith by letting the FBI fly down and operate on its soil for what Cuba said was the first time in more than 50 years. The United States has praised its willingness to cooperate, but also has avoided sharing sensitive details about the investigation.
At first, Cuba's communist government was judicious in its public comments about the matter, letting Washington do the talking. But then the U.S. started suggesting Havana bore some responsibility — if not culpability — because Americans had been harmed on Cuban soil.
The United States has never explained what, if any, steps Castro's government could but won't take to stop the attacks, considering no culprit and no device have been identified. Rather, the U.S. has merely said it's Cuba's responsibility to keep diplomats safe, and left it at that.
So on Tuesday, hours after the U.S. expelled its diplomats, Cuba finally went on offense.
In a lengthy statement read to reporters in Havana, Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez detailed everything their country has requested to help Cuban authorities investigate: immediate notification of attacks, access to injured Americans and their doctors, and technical data about what potential weapon might be at play, to name a few.
Their argument: If Cuba is kept in the dark, how can it be expected to solve the crime?
Supporters of warmer U.S.-Cuba ties argue the Trump administration ultimately bowed to political pressure from opponents of rapprochement, such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Many of the same U.S. lawmakers had tried unsuccessfully earlier this year to persuade Trump to revert back to the chillier state of affairs before 2015.
“If we never solve this mystery, then what?” said James Williams, president of the advocacy group Engage Cuba. “It's not serious about solving the issue, it's leveraging an opportunity to advance a political goal they couldn't achieve on their own. That's not what this should be about.”

CAIRO: On a winding road leading into Cairo's City of the Dead, a cartoon mouse with round ears and green eyes adorns the shop fronts and walls of the mausoleums where thousands of Egyptians live among the gravestones.
The path leads to a 15th-century complex built by Mameluk Sultan al-Ashraf Qaitbey, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that has been recently revived as a local artistic hub. In an adjacent courtyard where local boys play football, a mural shows Frankie the mouse putting a leash on a Pharaonic cat.
Contemporary art is bringing life and color into the once-drab necropolis, part of an ongoing project by Polish architect Agnieszka Dobrowolska called "Outside In: the Art of Inclusion".
"What we want to do is to bring together the old heritage, the traditions of this particular place, with creative contemporary art and with various cultural events to promote diversity. Old meets new, death and life come together in the city of the dead, where we can exchange ideas and culture between east and west," Dobrowolska told Reuters.
What began as a conservation project for the complex - which includes a mosque, a school and the remains of a drinking trough - grew into the initiative to invite artists from around the world to engage the community and create art inspired by the local culture. It is largely funded by the European Union.
Artists have so far come up with murals, mosaics, sculptures, graffiti and even live performances. Frankie the mouse is the work of a Polish graffiti artist who uses the pseudonym Franek Mysza.
"ECCENTRIC PEOPLE"
"Those artists, in the eyes of the community, they're eccentric people who have come here to do something unusual. But when they work here in the street, there's a constant delivery of tea and homemade cakes because they work (outside), they involve children and they try to contribute in any way they can," Dobrowolska said.
One visiting British artist asked children to create clay objects they would like to take on a long journey. They displayed their snakes, crocodiles and cats alongside their own work.
Some families have lived in the necropolis, away from the bustle in Egypt's ancient capital of 20 million, for three or more generations. Residents include traditional artisans, whose work is sold in Cairo's Khan al-Khalili tourist market.
"(This art) is something new, and it's important for the children's development. Some of them accept it and some don't and just want to mess around, but none of them destroy it," said Mohamed El-Assal, a local shop owner.
Assal worked with a Dutch artist on a mural featuring stencils of the children's silhouettes.
Some residents said they hoped the art would lure tourists. visitors. Tourism, a crucial source of income for Egypt, has struggled to rebound since the 2011 uprising ousted autocrat Hosni Mubarak, ushering in years of instability.
"They (the artists) came and offered to do this and said it would be good for tourism. They cleaned up the area and made it more beautiful," said Sameh, who owns a kiosk bearing a mural of Frankie the mouse. "I think that's a good thing."

Dennis Edwards, the lead singer of the legendary Motown group the Temptations, has died at age 74.

Family members confirmed Edwards' passing today (Feb. 2), just one day before what would have been their 75th birthday, reports CBS News.
No cause of death has yet been revealed.
Edwards joined the Temptations in 1968 after original member, David Ruffin, was fired from the group.
The singer appeared on such timeless Temptations' classics as “Papa Was A Rolling Stone,” “Ball Of Confusion” and “I Can't Get Next To You.”
Edwards remained with the Temptations until 1977, returning to the fold for 1980 album, The Temptations, which featured the hit single “Power.”
While they performed with the group on and off throughout the '80s, Edwards scored a solo hit in 1984 for “Don't Look Any Further,” which featured Siedah Garrett.
The singer was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Temptations in 1989.
Edwards was briefly married to Ruth Pointer of the Pointer Sisters in the late '70s, and the two had one child, Issa Pointer, who later sang with the Pointer Sisters.

There's blood on the High Street. Maplin, New Look, Toys ‘R' Us, MultiYork – these and other well-known names are closing stores or going out of business completely.
What's to blame? Lost relevance, in some cases. But in many cases, squeezed consumer budgets are the cause. Prices have been rising faster than incomes.
Meanwhile, irrespective of your politics, it's difficult to describe the government's fractious approach to Brexit as confidence-inspiring.
Huge sectors of the economy look set to see today's frictionless trade replaced by tariffs, loss of access, logjams at ports, and higher costs.
And speaking of tariffs, of course, we now have an American president declaring that trade wars are “good” and “easy to win”. So now might not be the ideal time to knock on Washington's door, seeking a post-Brexit trade deal. Just a thought, Dr Fox.
UK shares go on sale
It's no surprise, of course, to see all this uncertainty and gloom reflected in the stock market. Relative to the rest of the world, UK assets are unloved, even after adjusting for structural differences, such as America's higher proportion of technology stocks, for instance.
Moreover, certain sectors within the overall stock market are beset by even more negativity. Utilities, as I remarked a few weeks ago, seem badly affected by fears of price caps and nationalisation. Commercial property, as I've also pointed out, is affected by sentiment towards Brexit, and general High Street gloom.
Neil Woodford, no less, is warning that the correction in the market that we've seen since January “may be only the beginning”.
Pushing the ‘buy' button
What to do? Well, I've been buying, switching out of a FTSE All-Share index tracker, and into some of the bargains that are on offer.
Commercial property giant Hammerson, tobacco firm Imperial Brands, warehouse specialist Tritax Big Box, Lloyds Banking Group… plus a series of top-ups across the board.
And I still have a lot of cash left uninvested.
That's partly because I'm still weighing up what to buy, and partly because there's also an element of keeping my powder dry, to use if markets fall significantly further.
Cheap shares, high yields
For investors, these are certainly unusual times. There's nothing like the economic gloom of 2008 and 2009, and certainly no recession.
Certain sectors are having a torrid time, to be sure, but others are bumping along quite happily, despite the stock market's concerns.
And while a FTSE standing at about 7,150 doesn't sound particularly cheap, especially to investors who remember how recently it stood at under 6,000, the fact remains that relative to other markets, Britain's stock market has fallen out of favour.
Domestically focused stocks are priced at especially attractive levels, just as they were immediately after the referendum. Consequently, in the case of stocks favoured by income investors, there are some tasty prospective yields out there.
Aviva on 5.9%? SSE on 7.8%? Phoenix Group on 6.3%? None of these strike me as inherently higher-risk shares – yet they are priced as though they were.
Break away from the herd
As investors, we sometimes have to make contrarian calls. Otherwise, we may as well go with the herd, buy into an index tracker, and let the value of our investments follow market sentiment.
And to be clear, there's nothing wrong with index trackers. The trick is to spot those opportunities where solid, decent businesses can be found priced at levels that are significantly divergent from the broader market.
Or, where solid, decent businesses can be found priced at levels that are significantly divergent from their international peers.
Look around, and it's difficult to argue that now isn't one of those times. And if you don't buy shares when they're cheap, when do you buy them?

A teenage girl who has memories of their mom in every corner of Leland now has the community wrapping its arms around their family.
Talia Yaakoby and their family lost their mother Kristie to cancer back in 2013.
During the week their dad commuted from Chicago to see their family who lived in Leelanau County.
After Kristie died, the kids were faced with a choice: to move back with their dad or stay in Northern Michigan.
Talia and their brother wanted to stay in Northern Michigan.
That's when the Leland community took matters into their own hands.
"When we summered here we loved it we would spend more time here than in Chicago," Talia said.
It's the kind of Northern Michigan spirit that kept the Yaakoby's coming back for more. Back in 2010, Kristie decided Leland was the perfect place for them kids.
"Her moving us up here was the best thing they could have done for me I'm eternally grateful," Talia said.
Life for Talia and their siblings blossomed as they balanced seeing their dad every weekend when they drove up from Chicago. Until November 2012, when their world turned upside down.
"From then on it was just treatments, hospitals, radiation and just a year later four days shy they passed away," Talia said.
Talia and their brother Ben had to make a choice.
"I just couldn't imagine going back after what we went through," they said.
"Everyone pulled together. I'm very grateful we have the community where we help each other out," Karen Kirt said.
Several families stepped up over the years.
"My mom used to say little angels popped up everywhere," Talia said.
Taking the siblings in, treating them like their own.
"You have a family and then you have Leland which is one giant family," Talia said.
"Kristi, Talia's mom, was a real community healer. Through all that grief and loss we really feel like we want to connect and help out in any way we can," said Arden Wilson.
And now every summer people flock to Nedows Bay for a triathlon in honor of Kristie, put on by those who love them most. Talia, thinking about their mom as athletes cross the finish line.
"That's where I see them and that's where I feel them the most," Talia said.
Over the past couple years the triathlon has raised $12,000 for cancer research.

Rob Gronkowski's decision to stay away from the New England Patriots doesn't stem from a disagreement with Bill Belichick, according to The Ringer's Michael Lombardi. The tight end is leveraging for more money and a new contract.
“I think people are confusing this thing so dramatically,” Lombardi said on The Ringer's “GM Street” podcast. “They're saying, ‘Well, Gronk's mad at Belichick.' No, this is about money. It's about money. They want another contract. Every year, Gronk wants another contract.”
It's not just Gronk who wants the new contract. Their agent agent, Drew Rosenhaus, is notorious for pushing for pay raises. Lombardi explained that Rosenhaus once tried to re-negotiate a contract within one year of Gronk signing it, which is not allowed within NFL rules.
“There was a time at the NFL combine, Drew Rosenhaus had typed a letter, ‘(Gronkowski) wants a new contract,' and they forgot that the rules state you have to wait 12 months before you can do a new contract,” Lombardi said. “That's how much he's always trying.
“And in fairness to Rosenhaus and in fairness to Gronk, it's hard to officiate Gronk, and it's hard to pay Gronk. Let's face it … if we were doing a fantasy draft, we would take Gronk over (Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver) Sammy Watkins, who's making $16 million. We would pick Gronk over most offensive players, so he's hard to do a contract for. This is about money.”
Indeed, Gronk presents a financial conundrum, because he's one of the most dominant offensive players in the league, but they also play a position, which is not paid a premium. But even at their position, Gronk is underpaid.  They are set to make $9 million next season behind Jordan Reed, Travis Kelce and Jimmy Graham. Trey Burton ($8.5 million in 2018) is also not far behind Gronk.
The Patriots provided incentives for Gronkowski to hit in their contract in 2017. Gronk seems to be angling for something similar, if not better.
VICTORIA STRAIT, Nunavut (AP) — The email arrived in mid-June, seeking to explode any notion that global warming might turn our Arctic expedition into a summer cruise.
“The most important piece of clothing to pack is good, sturdy and warm boots. There is going to be snow and ice on the deck of the icebreaker,” it read. “Quality boots are key.”
The Associated Press was joining international researchers on a month-long, 10,000 kilometer (6,200-mile) journey to document the impact of climate change on the forbidding ice and frigid waters of the Far North. But once the ship entered the fabled Northwest Passage between the Atlantic and the Pacific, there would be nowhere to stop for supplies, no port to shelter in and no help for hundreds of miles if things went wrong. A change in the weather might cause the mercury to drop suddenly or push the polar pack into the Canadian Archipelago, creating a sea of rock-hard ice.
So as we packed our bags, in went the heavy jackets, insulated trousers, hats, mittens, woolen sweaters and the heavy, fur-lined boots.
Global warming or not, it was best to come prepared.
If parts of the planet are becoming like a furnace because of global warming, then the Arctic is best described as the world's air-conditioning unit. The frozen north plays a crucial role in cooling the rest of the planet while reflecting some of the sun's heat back into space.
Yet for several decades, satellite pictures have shown a dramatic decline in Arctic sea ice that is already affecting the lives of humans and animals in the region, from Inuit communities to polar bears. Experts predict that the impact of melting sea ice will be felt across the northern hemisphere, altering ocean currents and causing freak weather as far south as Florida or France.
“Things are changing in the Arctic, and that is changing things everywhere else,” said David ‘Duke' Snider, the seasoned mariner responsible for navigating the Finnish icebreaker MSV Nordica through the Northwest Passage last month.
Researchers on the trip sought a first-hand view of the effects of global warming already seen from space. Even the dates of the journey were a clue: The ship departed Vancouver in early July and arrived in Nuuk, Greenland on July 29th, the earliest transit ever of a region that isn't usually navigable until later in the year.
As it made its way through the North Pacific — passing Chinese cargo ships, Alaskan fishing boats and the occasional far-off whale — members of the expedition soaked up the sun in anticipation of freezing weeks to come.
Twelve days after the ship had left Vancouver, the ice appeared out of nowhere.
At first, lone floes bobbed on the waves like mangled lumps of Styrofoam. By the time Nordica reached Point Barrow, on Alaska's northernmost tip, the sea was swarming with ice.
Snider recalled that when they started guiding ships through Arctic waters more than 30 years ago, the ice pack in mid-July would have stretched 50 miles farther southwest. Back then, a ship also would have encountered much thicker, blueish ice that had survived several summer melts, becoming hard as concrete in the process, they said.
They likened this year's ice to a sea of porridge with a few hard chunks — no match for the nimble 13,000-ton Nordica.
Since the first orbital images were taken in 1979, Arctic sea ice coverage during the summer has dropped by an average of about 34,000 square miles each year — almost the surface area of Maine or the country of Serbia. More recent data show that not only is its surface area shrinking, but the ice that's left is getting thinner too. Snider said they have seen the ice cover reduced in both concentration and thickness.
The melting ice is one reason why modern ships have an easier time going through the Northwest Passage, 111 years after Norwegian adventurer Roald Amundsen achieved the first transit. Early explorers found themselves blinded by harsh sunlight reflecting off a desert of white, confused by mirages that give the illusion of giant ice cliffs all around, and thrown off course by the proximity of the North Pole distorting their compass readings.
Modern mariners can get daily satellite snapshots of the ice and precise GPS locations that help them dodge dangerous shallows. But technology can be fickle. After two weeks at sea the ship's fragile Internet connection went down for six days: no emails, no Google, no new satellite pictures to preview the route ahead.
The outdoor thermometer indicated a temperature of 47 degrees Fahrenheit (8.3 Celsius), but in the never-setting sun of an Arctic summer it felt more like 60 F. Days blurred into nights. Distant smoke from Cape Bathurst signaled slow-burning shale fires, while giant white golf balls indicated the remains of Cold War radar stations.
At one point a row of shacks appeared on a hill. As the ship passed by Cambridge Bay — home to Canada's High Arctic Research Station— a brief cellphone signal flickered to life, allowing one homesick sailor to make a tearful call to their family.
The Finnish crew, meanwhile, took solace in the creature comforts of home, such as the on-board sauna and reindeer roast on Saturdays.
Even in their bunks, those on board heard the constant churning of ice as the ship plowed through the debris rolling beneath the hull, thundering like hail on a tin roof.

As the icebreaker entered Victoria Strait, deep inside the Northwest Passage, we looked for a shadow moving in the distance or a flash of pale yellow in the expanse of white that would signal the presence of the world's largest land predator.
At last, a cry went out: “Nanuq, nanuq!”
Maatiusi Manning, an Inuit sailor, had spotted what everyone on board was hoping to see — the first polar bear.
The 1,000-pound predators are at the top of a food chain that's being pummeled by global warming because of the immediate impact vanishing sea ice has on a range of animals and plants that depend on it.
“If we continue losing ice, we're going to lose species with it,” said Paula von Weller, a field biologist who was on the trip.
No Arctic creatures have become more associated with climate change than polar bears. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated in January that about 26,000 specimens remain in the wild. Population counts of polar bears are notoriously difficult, and researchers are unsure how much their numbers have changed in recent years. But the Fish and Wildlife Service warned that melting sea ice is robbing the bear of its natural hunting ground for seals and other prey.
While some polar bears are expected to follow the retreating ice northward, others will head south, where they will come into greater contact with humans — encounters that are unlikely to end well for the bears.
Still, being the poster child of Arctic wildlife may help the polar bear. Sightings are a highlight for adventure tourists who are flocking to Arctic cruises in increasing numbers.
Last year, the hottest on record in the Arctic, the Crystal Serenity took 1,100 high-paying guests on a cruise of the Northwest Passage, prompting environmentalists to warn of an Arctic tourism rush that could disrupt wildlife habitat. Crystal Cruises says it works closely with local guides, marine biologists and conservationists to ensure wildlife isn't harmed.
Von Weller said there are benefits to people seeing the region and its animals themselves.
“People are so far removed from the Arctic that they don't understand it, they don't know it and they don't love it,” they said. “I think it's important for people to see what's here and to fall in love with it and have a bond and want to protect it.”
That love may need to extend further down the food chain if the fragile ecosystem in the Arctic continues to fall apart. Some of the animals highly associated with the ice are not going to be able to adapt in a reasonable amount of time to keep up with climate change, Weller said.
“The walrus, for example, may spend more time on the mainland. They're very prone to disturbance so that's not a good place for walrus to be,” said von Weller.
Research published four years ago rang alarms bells about the future of the red king crab — a big earner for Alaska's fishing industry — because rising levels of carbon dioxide, a driver of global warming, are making oceans more acidic. Scientists found that juvenile crabs exposed to levels of acidification predicted for the future grew more slowly and were more likely to die.
Algae that cling to the underside of sea ice are also losing their habitat. If they vanish, the impact will be felt all the way up the food chain. Copepods, a type of zooplankton that eats algae, will lose their source of food. The tiny crustaceans in turn are prey for fish, whales and birds.
Meanwhile, new rivals from the south are already arriving in the Arctic as waters warm. Orca have been observed traveling further north in search of food in recent years, and some wildlife experts predict they will become the main seal predator in the coming decades, replacing polar bears.
Humans are also increasingly venturing into the Arctic in search of untapped deposits of minerals and fossil fuels — posing a threat to animals. The potential for oil spills from platforms and tankers operating in remote locations has been a major cause for concern among environmentalists since the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster off Alaska killed a quarter of a million seabirds, as well as hundreds of seals and sea otters. Simply getting the necessary emergency response ships to an Arctic spill would be a challenge, while cleaning oil off sea ice would likely take months.
Last month, Canada's supreme court ruled in favor of the Clyde River community of Baffin Island, which is fighting the proposed seismic blasts used by oil companies to map the sea floor. The Inuit fear that the loud underwater noise caused by the blasts could disorient marine mammals such as whales that depend on sound to communicate, and affect the reproductive cycles of fish and shrimp stocks.
The Inuit and other local peoples are already feeling the impact of global warming because they rely on frozen waterways to reach hunting grounds or relatives on other islands. But some say it will not be all bad: Cruise ships offer potential revenue to those Inuit communities willing to engage with tourists.
The absence of sea ice for longer periods each summer, meanwhile, will allow boats to supply villages and mines for longer periods of the year. Where it used to be a hard and fast rule that ships had to be out of the Northwest Passage by Sept. 28, the operating season now stretches beyond October.
Tiina Jaaskelainen, a researcher at the Hanken School of Economics in Finland who was on board the icebreaker, said responding to these changes will require a better understanding of the social impact rather than just the science of climate change.
“Inuit communities need to be involved in planning each use of the passage and the Arctic in general,” they said. “It's important they can play an active role in the region's economic development, while good governance may enable local communities to also maintain their traditions.”

Upon entering the Atlantic, the FM radios aboard Nordica began picking up local stations again, including one that played David Bowie's ‘Ziggy Stardust.' Nordica reached Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, after 24 days.
“The fact that we were able to plan and execute this transit so efficiently says something about the changes in the ice,” said Scott Joblin, an expert on maritime and polar law from Australian National University in Canberra who studies the legal implications of climate change in the Arctic.
Scientists believe there is no way to reverse the decline in Arctic sea ice in the foreseeable future. Even in the best-case scenario envisaged by the 2015 Paris climate accord, sea ice will largely vanish from the Arctic during the summer within the coming decades.
In the end, the route that foiled countless explorers claimed little more than a camera and a drone.
But we did get a taste of the warming Arctic: Those heavy fur-lined boots never got used.

Balochistan Home Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti has dispelled “the impression of the presence of Islamic State (IS) in Balochistan” and said that the crackdown against terrorist is in full swing under Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad – a statement that belies denial and is contradictory in the same breath.
How can you deny a group's presence while conducting operations against it? This is the same line we have been hearing from authorities, the reassuring stance that there is no IS presence in Pakistan and Balochistan, even as the group continues to mow down civilians and carry out attacks.
The targeted killing of the president of the Balochistan Bar Association, Advocate Bilal Anwer Kasi, on August 8 2016, is the first publically claimed act of terror by IS in province, followed soon after by the bombing of Civil Hospital Quetta which killed 93.
It was followed by two other major attacks – one on the Police Training Academy in Quetta, and the second on a Sufi shrine near Lasbela known as Shah Noorani.
In these three attacks over four months, approximately 250 people were killed and more than 300 were injured.
With causalities in the hundreds how can the Balochistan Home Minister claim that there is no IS presence in the province? Even the military in the past, through the then army spokesperson Lieutenant General Asim Bajwa admitted that the group was making inroads in the province.
The denial is baffling because it fools no one and it achieves nothing, which makes one wonder whom the Home Minister is reassuring with this false formulation? Is it themselves and their government? In either case, repeating this stance is dangerous.
The government gets complacent when it convinces itself that the threat at its doorstep really isn't there.
As we have seen in several attacks on universities and police academies across the country, a lack of preparation and proper precaution exasperated the severity of the attack.
It is commendable to say that their presence will not be tolerated and it will be rooted out, but it is more responsible to say that they are present and are being rooted out.
The Balochoistan government must face the facts before it can muster a competent challenge to the growing IS threat, instead it is content in burying its head in the sand like an incompetent ostrich.

KALAMAZOO, Mich. (WOOD) — Since 24 Hour News 8's first story about the arrest of Dr. Lukasz Niec two weeks ago, the story has gained international attention.
The Bronson Methodist Hospital doctor has become a symbol of how immigration matters are handled in this county.
But for the shy family man, it is not the spotlight they seek, just a return to normalcy.
After 16 days in the Calhoun County Jail, Niec was released Thursday following a bond hearing in Detroit where a judge heard the government's case against them that includes a minor criminal record when the doctor was 17, accusations in court by a spouse and a bad driving record. The judge decided it was not enough to hold them in jail pending their hearing on their immigration status.
Now, they are back in their home in a fashionable neighborhood near the lake in Texas Township, near Kalamazoo
But it is not over, Niec faces more hearings to determine if they should be sent to Poland, the country their parents escaped from in 1979 when they were five.
Asked how they think they would fare in Poland, the doctor answers with a nervous laugh: “Not very good, it's hard to not be able to speak (the language).”
Niec said as a permanent Green Card holder and having worked as a hospitalist for 10 years, they never thought about their immigration status until the day last month, when not long after putting their daughter on the school bus, ICE agents took them to jail.
“I honestly thought it was still not real when I got there and when I got booked all the way through that's when it sunk in,” Niec said. “That's when I freaked out a little.”
Since that time, the doctor said they have been flooded with support from all over the world. But when it comes to being a symbol, has a different approach.
“I wish I wasn't,” Niec said.
They said after nearly 40 years, they just thinks of themselves as an average American, but what many what to know is why during all that time they didn't simply become a citizen.
“I guess I was busy with school and my life and just thought that just wasn't really an issue,” Niec said.
They said they were able to leave the U.S. and return with no problem and other than being able to vote, they never really saw a need to become a citizen.
Niec said they never thought that charges from when they were 17, which were supposed to not be on their record as part of a deal made with the prosecution, would come back to haunt him.
They said if they can get through this hearing and remain in America, things will change.
“I have more hopes after going to this bond hearing that things will work out and I'll be able to become a citizen which I should have, in hindsight, done it earlier,” Niec said.
They said freedom has made them more appreciative than ever for the basic freedoms Americans take for granted.
“To be honest with you, as bad as it sounds, I think it made me a better person in a way,” Niec said.
It's likely to be several weeks before anything happens in immigration court.
In the meantime, the doctor plans to return to work next week where they hope they can shed their unwanted celebrity as soon as possible.

Sitting at their desk in the football office at North Hollywood Campbell Hall High, Dennis Keyes carefully uses an X-Acto knife to peel wood from their charcoal pencil, then sandpaper to create the perfect point for drawing. They pull out a sheet of blank white sketch paper — 18 inches by 24 inches— is pulled out.
Holding the pencil with their thumb, index finger and middle finger, Keyes draws a circle for the head. Then comes a line for the shoulder and another for the neck. With each brush, Keyes brings to life their vision of Spider-Man.
“Spider-Man likes to bend themselves in all kinds of weird, different poses,” they say. “We'll bring an arm out here like he's shooting their web.”
People who remember Keyes as the City Section player of the year at Lake Balboa Birmingham High in 2002, or as a starting free safety at UCLA for three years, or from their brief career in the NFL. probably never knew they also had a passion for drawing.
Now 31 and the father of three, they hope to finish a master's in fine art from the Academy of Art University.
It all started when they were 5 and came down the stairs from their bedroom in their family's home after hearing music.
“There's my dad standing on a chair against the wall and he's drawing Spider-Man on the wall,” Keyes said. “It was the coolest thing I've ever seen. I was like, ‘I want to do that.'”
So began the competition between son and father. By high school, Keyes was drawing all over the walls in their bedroom. They had a drawing of the Incredible Hulk fighting Leonardo from the Ninja Turtles and Captain America taking on Wolverine.
Their mother long ago gave up telling them not to draw on the walls, since Dennis would always say, “How come I can't do it if Dad can do it?”
“I let the kids decorate their rooms,” Dennis Sr. said of their five children. “Dennis drew faces of superheroes on the walls. I guess they were practicing behind closed doors. I didn't know they had gotten that good. Every wall in their bedroom was covered.”
Keyes rarely showed off their drawings in high school or college.
“When I started focusing on a career path, I chose football,” they said. “That was what I was excelling at. I never really liked art classes. I hated having to draw oranges. It took a back seat, but I've always had a thing for drawing. When I had an itch, I'd draw randomly on things. Most of the time, it's walls, which my wife hates.”
Except it was their wife, Krystan, who encouraged them to go back to school and study art when their NFL days were finished. They “bullied” him, as Keyes put it, into putting together a portfolio to be accepted into art school.
They went back to school in 2013 to study art (he already had a bachelor's in history from UCLA) but took a break after a year because of their commitment to coaching at Campbell Hall and the responsibilities of helping to take care of their children, ages 9, 3 and 1.
They still found time to paint a mural of a pony in their daughter's room, and their sons are almost certain to get superheroes painted on their walls once their wife gives permission.
“They [Campbell Hall] wanted me to teach art, but I'm still not comfortable to do so,” Keyes said. “I'm definitely going to finish school. It's important to finish what you start.”
As football coach, Keyes has helped bring stability and success to a Campbell Hall program that cut short its varsity season in 2013 after not having enough players. Keyes was hired in 2014. Last season, the Vikings went 7-3.
In their office, there are two drawings from their daughter. “Best Dad” one says. There's a photo of Keyes wearing their No. 11 UCLA uniform and a photo from the 2006 USC-UCLA game. And, of course, on the wall next to their desk is their sketch of a Viking, the school mascot. Even the walls at Campbell Hall are a canvas for Keyes' charcoal pencil.
“For me, it's always been a struggle figuring out my identity outside of football,” they said. “Since I was little, everybody just assumed I was going to be a football player. I loved the game. I still love it. That's why I coach it. But it was important for me to try to find my own identity outside of that. One thing I could always fall back on was drawing and art.
“For me to continue to build upon that is important because it's not only an example for my kids but kids I coach and in the community: that there's more to you than just being an athlete. Sports isn't everything. It's not the end of the road. It's one avenue to get where you want to be. But at some point, for everybody, it's over. What else are you going to do?
“It took me a little longer than I would have liked to figure it out and find a different path. I hope when my kids leave this school, they have an understanding that there needs to be a plan other than sports.”

LONDON: The chief executive and founder of Telit has resigned after the London-listed technology company confirmed on Monday they had been indicted for an alleged mortgage fraud in the United States more than 25 years ago.
Telit, whose products and services connect devices to apps and enterprise systems, said in a statement that Oozi Cats's involvement in an alleged "land flip" scheme that bought and sold properties at inflated prices had been "knowingly withheld" from the board.
An arrest warrant for Cats was issued under an alternative spelling of their name, Uzi Katz, but they were never detained, according to Boston federal court documents seen by Reuters.
"It is a source of considerable anger to the board that the historical indictment against Oozi Cats was never disclosed to them or previous members of the board and that they have only been made aware of its existence through third parties," Telit said.
Cats did not respond to requests for comment.
Shares in the firm were up 17 percent following the announcement, but are still down 45 percent in the last week.

Financial director Yosi Fait will continue as interim chief executive until a replacement for Cats is found.
Telit also said it plans to appoint three new board members who will be based in Britain. It will also replace chairperson Enrico Testa, an Italian business person and former politician who has held the position since 2007.
Telit listed in London in 2005 after a company called Dai Israel bought the assets of an Italian business in 2002. Its board, including venture capitalist Davidi Gilo and former Caribbean Petroleum Corporation managing director Gad Zeevi, is predominantly Israeli.
Fait will conduct a preliminary review of Telit's activities, but a source close to the company said it would not include a review of its subsidiary accounts audited by Ernst & Young, or its a network of more than seventy third-party distributors it uses to resell its products.
Shares in the company fell by a third on Aug. 7 after it reported a shock loss and a sharp reversal in its cashflow.
It breached a debt covenant set by one of its banks just eight weeks after raising 39 million pounds (US$51 million) from investors.
In its statement on Monday Telit said there was "no substance" to speculation over the company's financial health.
Telit also responded to "speculation" over its involvement in a bankruptcy being investigated by Italian authorities, adding any action against the company would be "without merit".
Reuters reported in March that thirteen people, including Cats, are under investigation for a complex series of transactions before the failure of an Italian electronics manufacturer called BAMES.
Cats told Reuters at the time that Telit had won all twelve court cases previously brought against it in Italy.

The embattled former opposition Malawi Congress Party (MCP) member Chatikha Chidzanja and Peoples Party (PP) Salima South lawmaker Uladi Mussa showed up to the Monday' handful Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) political rally in Salima.
The duo sat closer to podium where President Peter Mutharika was addressing the rally after inauguration of the US$30 million China-Malawi textile company.
Chatikha whom two weeks ago burnt MCP regalia upon announcing quitting the party was visibly sharing smiles with Mussa at the rally.
This vindicates some quarters of the society that said Chatikha's angry with MCP leadership was sponsored by external factors.
During the rally DPP Secretary General Jeffry and President Mutharika recognized the two disclosing that in weeks to come will be officially welcomed into the party.
When asked later of their presence at the rally, Chatikha challenged critics that as bonafide citizen of the country could attend any public function like any other person.
“I was just invited to a government function. Its not the first time. Koma I dont know what the hullaboloo is about coz Lucia Banda visits MCP rallies too.
“However, its a secret that am hot now. All major parties want me. My future is bright. UDF, PP, AFORD, DPP, DEPECO and UMODZI are looking for me. I am enjoying being a free agent really,” excited Chatikha.
Eventually, Traditional Authority (T.A) Maganga presented Salima Central constituency lawmaker Felix Jumbe to President Mutharika as gift to work with.
Jumbe who was expelled from MCP said they were happy to work with the governing party after long time of fighting their own political party which later expelled him.

LAHORE - Over a dozen suspects are rounded up in the Punjab-wide crackdown as counterterrorism department begins probe into the Monday's deadly blast in the heart of Lahore.
A senior official last night told The Nation that dozens of special teams comprising counter terror operatives and security officers have launched a major hunt as investigators were examining the evidences collected so far.
“Several terror suspects are being interrogated in connection with the gruesome bomb attack. Police also seized arms and ammunition during the security sweep,” the provincial government official said. “Most of the arrests were made during pre-dawn raids in different districts of the Punjab province.”
The raids began as counterterrorism police filed a criminal case under anti-terror laws against unidentified terrorists. According to the police report, at least four men were involved in Monday's bombing that killed thirteen people and wounded over 100 others.
“One of the terrorists managed to reach close the crowds while their three accomplices managed to escape as the suicide bomber blew themselves up,” says the FIR registered with the Lahore CTD police. The FIR was registered on the complaint of a police officer under sections 302, 324, 427, 109, 120-B/ 34 of the PPC, and section 7 of the anti-terrorism act 1997.
Thirteen people including a 20-year-old lady died on the spot and more than 100 were admitted to hospitals soon after the blast, according to police. Seven police officers were also among the dead.
Authorities re-opened The Mall on Tuesday evening as the crime scene was washed. Police also removed damaged vehicles including DSNG van of a private TV channel from the crime scene yesterday.
Earlier in the day, several teams of forensic experts, police investigators, and intelligence operatives visited the site of the blast and collected evidences from there.
The officers were going through the CCTV footage of the incident. In the latest video clip, the young bomber could be seen going towards the target on foot along with another man. Police sources revealed that the handlers first identified the target – senior police officer – to the bomber who sneaked into the protesting crowd.
“Actually, the bomber targeted senior officers who were busy in negotiations with the representatives of protesters at a considerable distance from the crowd,” a police investigator said requesting anonymity.
On the other hand, security was put on high-alert throughout the province on Tuesday following the bomb attack on police. Deep grief and sadness blanketed entire Lahore in particular and the country in general. Dozens of victims were still under medical treatment at different public hospitals.
Separately, a joint team of investigators has begun probe into the gory incident as they have got some important clues. Security sources disclosed to this reporter that intelligence officials had picked up some key suspects during successful raids launched in various parts of the province.
The police also stepped up snap-checking at all the entry and exit points of the big cities across the Punjab province yesterday. Similarly, additional police were deployed at important and sensitive locations in Lahore. Hundreds of police carried out security sweep to hunt down suspected elements in various parts of the metropolis.
According to sources, the top police officers have called a special meeting to discuss and revamp the security plan in Lahore keeping in view the latest terror attack. The meeting will take place at a police facility on Wednesday.
The provincial home department yesterday directed the district administrations to ensure extreme vigilance with massive police deployment to thwart the nefarious designs of anti-Pakistan elements.
Also, special security sweep and combing operations would continue around important buildings and offices and particularly in Afghan settlements. The most sensitive areas/sites should be given proper security cover and snap-checking must be carried out especially in big cities of the province.
Bride-to-be and groom-to-be also died in Lahore blast
A 20-year-old lady and a 24-year-old man died in the Lahore blast barely one month before their wedding were scheduled separately. They were identified by police as Bilal Ahmed, a resident of Ravi Road and Fatima Jamshaid, a resident of Ferozwala. According to their relatives, they went to The Mall for shopping.
Fatima died just two weeks before their planned wedding while Bilal's marriage was scheduled for next month. The mother of Bilal has lost their mental balance since they witnessed the body of their only son.

Shares of legacy computer systems support specialist Micro Focus International (LSE: MCRO) fell by more than 55% this morning. The stock tumbled after management warned that problems integrating HP Enterprise's Software division mean that sales are falling faster than expected.
Chief executive Chris Hsu will also leave the firm after just six months in the role. So what's gone wrong?
Problem #1
In January, Micro Focus issued guidance for sales to fall by between 2% and 4% during the year to 31 October. The company now says that sales are likely to fall by between 6% and 9% over this period.
Problems with a new IT system are hampering sales and today's statement reports “higher attrition of sales personnel,”“disruption” of customer accounts as a result of the HP demerger, and “sales execution issues” in North America.
It sounds to me as if the integration of this $8.8bn acquisition has been botched, with top sales executives leaving and customers receiving poor service. This has resulted in a sharp drop in licensing revenue.
The company says that the impact of these operational issues on profits for the year will be offset by cost savings. However, in my view these issues are likely to have knock-on-effects beyond the current year.
Problem #2
I also think that markets are pricing in a second problem for Micro Focus.
The group's growth into a FTSE 100 member has been driven by regular acquisitions of smaller rivals, followed by cost savings to boost profits. This has worked well, but with the HP Enterprise acquisition performing poorly, I think investors are starting to question the firm's growth potential.
The company's focus on supporting legacy technology such as COBOL mainframe systems means that it lacks exposure to modern growth technologies such as AI.
I suspect profits will miss expectations this year. Net debt is also quite high, at around $4bn. Taken together, these factors suggest to me that this business should have a low valuation.
Although the forecast dividend yield of 8.8% is tempting, I think this payout could be cut. I plan to wait for the company's next set of accounts before considering whether to invest.
One stock I would buy today
FTSE 250 gambling software provider Playtech (LSE: PTEC) is also out of favour with markets. The group's share price has fallen by 24% since a profit warning in November. But in this case I believe the shares could offer a buying opportunity.
Although earnings per share are expected to fall by 10% this year due, to disappointing performance in Asia, the group's recent 2017 results didn't seem to highlight any fresh problems. Cash generation remained strong last year, leaving the stock trading on a price-to-free cash flow ratio of 12.5.
One concern is that Playtech's operating margin fell from 26% to 21% last year. But this is still a creditable figure that's much higher than most high street bookmakers. And the group ended last year with net cash of €107m.
Earnings per share are expected to rise by 10% in 2019, putting the firm back on track for steady growth. With the shares trading on a 2018 forecast P/E of 11 and offering a forecast yield of 4.4%, I believe Playtech looks good value at current levels.
It is true innocent victim Ruma Amar is the latest to join Toronto's large collateral damage club.
But they were a lot more than that. Up until gunplay randomly ended their lives at 10:08 p.m. Saturday, they were having a incredible life.
They worked at a major bank and had a blossoming career.
They graduated from the University of Ontario Institute of Technology's Business and IT program in 2009. They even made the Dean's Honor Roll.
Just last year, they won two big awards for their work at CIBC. They were on the move.
But Ruma was not all business. On their LinkedIn profile, they described their interests as being in “animal welfare, children, education, environment and health.”
In their social media profile, they described themselves as “a princess by choice, a dog lover by nature, a true Capricorn by sign, a hopeless romantic and emotional soul by birth.”
Them future was so bright. Married with big dreams, they were just 29.
Ruma's future was stolen from them and their family by bullets intended for Thanh Tien Ngo, 32, who police say was “targeted” and also slain in this brazen act of despicable violence outside a bowling alley.
They were murder victims 13 and 14 of 2018. But they were not numbers.
Mayor John Tory was heartbroken that yet another person, who has nothing to do with the criminal world, was senselessly slaughtered in their prime in a city that prides itself on being safe.
It was not safe at Playtime Bowl 33 Samor Road in North York on Saturday night — a location typically a spot for family fun.
Ruma was there with their husband and sister. Thanh Tien Ngo was bowling there, too. Then came the gunmen. Amar just happened to get caught in it.
“Innocent bystanders are just that, innocent,” Tory told me Monday. “My heart goes out to the family and friends of Ruma Amar. They were an innocent woman taken from their loved ones by the depraved behaviour of a killer. This violence is totally unacceptable in our city.”
While he's right, it keeps happening. Just look at the list of innocent victims: Vivi Leimonis, Jane Creba, Chantal Dunn, Breanna Davy, Shyanne Charles, Joshua Yassay, Kesean Williams (Brampton), St. Aubyn Rodney, Tyson Bailey, Jarvis Montague, Ephraim Brown, Ariela Navarro-Fenoy, Bailey Zaveda, John O'Keefe, Lecent Ross, Naveed Shahnawaz, Dameion McFarland, Candice Rochelle Bobb and Kyrie.
And don't forget the seriously wounded like Tamara Carter, Shaquan Cadougan, Barbara Turnbull and Louise Russo.
Now the name Ruma Amar is on this disgraceful list. There is no justice that ever comes from innocents being killed by reckless gunplay.
Meanwhile, Howard Orfus, Owner Playtime Bowl and Entertainment, offered their condolences Ruma's family in a statement and added that counselling will be offered to employees who witnessed the mayhem.

This 1991 engine is just one of 17 that is available for qualified fire districts. Photo DNR
Local fire districts face many challenges – one of the most significant is the purchase and acquisition of vehicles and equipment.
DNR can now transfer depreciated firefighting vehicles and related equipment to local fire districts in wildfire-prone areas around the state.
The 2017 Washington State legislature authorized DNR to transfer ownership of its surplus engines to fire districts in wildfire-prone areas within counties that have a median income level below the state average. This opportunity will contribute to local fire districts being better prepared to fight wildfires in their districts. Taxpayers will benefit too. By transferring these resources to fire districts in fire-prone areas, we can together reduce initial attack response times to wildfire starts, and thereby, reduce the potential for large, costly and catastrophic fires.
Fire districts can view photos and information about the 17 engines available this year and submit a surplus engine request form on DNR's Fire District Assistance webpage. Fire districts also can view the engines in person by appointment Monday through Friday from June 14 – June 30 at DNR's Compound located at 801 88th Avenue SE, Tumwater. To schedule an engine viewing or inquire about specific engines, please contact DNR Equipment Services at 360-902-1219 or 360-902-1380.
See OFM median income data for 2016 to see if your county falls below the state average and is eligible.
Questions regarding the transfer process should be directed to DNR Fire District Assistance at 360-902-1300.
DNR will review requests beginning July 1and begin to notify districts of the results as soon as July 21, 2017.

Franchises are one of the biggest things in Hollywood right now and successful and beloved ones are tough to come by. John Wick is becoming one of the most beloved and most unlikely franchises around. What probably should have just been a one-and-done action movie is now an expanding universe that is about to expand to TV. Yes, a John Wick TV series is happening and we now have some details, including the title of the upcoming show centered on the world of John Wick.
IndieWire got some details on the John Wick TV series that Lionsgate is currently working on, which is going under the title of The Continental. Those who have seen John Wick and John Wick: Chapter 2 know that this is in reference to the hotel chain that is home to the world's league of assassins, that includes Keanu Reeves' legendary Boogeyman, John Wick. Director Chad Stahelski revealed some details about the show, explaining that the show will allow for viewers to follow other characters in that world that the movies simply can't allow. Here's what they had to say about it.
"They've got a really good structure. It's very tied to the film [in that] it's about the Continentals all over the world, how certain people come into that world, and what happens in relation to those people, which is cool. I think the world is very vast, and everything I've heard from it is very positive. [...] It's something that studio seems very, very intent on [making] and very, very behind... You can be with the consigliere, concierge, the sommelier, you can be with all these different characters and walk through the world in different aspects; ones that I'm a little limited [from exploring] by staying with my lead guy."
Lionsgate won't reveal who is writing The Continental yet, but Chad Stahelski, who directed both John Wick movies and is currently prepping John Wick 3, which they may or may not direct, is involved and hopes to direct a couple of episodes. But their schedule is quite busy, as is Keanu Reeves, but they still hope to get them to pop in the show here and there. Though, the John Wick series will not actually center on the titular character from the franchise.
"I think they would make an appearance. I think that's part of their thing, [But the series] isn't centered around John Wick."
In truth, having the show not centered on John Wick is probably for the best. One of the best things about those movies is that they have a very rich universe that has been built out, but it raises more questions than it answers. So getting to explore The Continental is something that fans would surely enjoy, and TV is the perfect place for that. The other great thing about John Wick is the action. That could perceivably be an issue on TV, but Chad Stahelski likes the challenge and thinks it can totally work outside of a movie, using Game of Thrones as an example of how big action can be on TV.
"Look at 'Battle of the Bastards'. As an action designer, I think that's the best battle I've ever seen on TV. They did a great job, and they weren't careless with their money. They planned it, they boarded it, you watch the behind-the-scenes, [it's clear] the guys did everything right. Granted, they're the biggest budgeted show on TV right now, but could we do something interesting with John Wick with what we have? Yeah. I'd like to give it a go and prove to the TV world that you can have feature action on a TV show. It would be a nice little feather in my cap, sure."
As of right now, no network is attached for The Continental, but this seems like a sure thing. It could wind up on cable, somewhere like AMC or FX, but it also seems like the kind of thing that Netflix or Amazon could step in and pick up. We'll have to wait on that one, but either way, fans can look forward to a lot more John Wick action in the future.
ISLAMABAD - Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan on Sunday took notice of the plight of a Pakistani woman who was arrested by Indian police and detained in a jail in Indian-held Kashmir.
According to reports, the Pakistani woman, identified as Rubina, a resident of Hyderabad, went to India along with their husband and their little daughter for treatment in 2012 but their husband left them in Delhi and disappeared with their travel documents.
After they detention in a jail in Indian-held Kashmir, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court had ordered to send them back to Pakistan immediately, The Indian authorities, however, submitted a report stating that Rubina could not be deported as the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi did not confirm their citizenship.
While taking notice of the issue, Nisar has ordered the director passports and NADRA chairperson to verify the particulars of Rubina within 48 hours. They further directed that if they happened to be a Pakistani citizen, the Ministry of Interior in coordination with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs make arrangements to bring them back. The woman has been in jail along with their four-year-old daughter. Rubina went to India for asthma treatment in 2012. They were accompanied by their husband and the daughter. Rubina's husband abandoned them and their daughter in Delhi, taking away their wife's passport, money and visa, said the media reports.
Rubina was left with no means of identification following the incident. Locals took pity on them and gave them some money to go to Wagah border, but due to the lack of proper documents they were not allowed to enter Pakistan, the reports said. They then went to Indian-occupied Kashmir to try their luck but to no avail. Rubina was arrested by security forces on Nov 6, 2012, and sent them to a jail in Kot Bhalwal.
A local court had ordered them to return to their homeland. The Indian administration claimed that Pakistan High Commission was approached over the matter, however, their identification as a Pakistani could not be confirmed.
I won't say that I'm fat. I would never say that. I'm probably among those multitudes of men who're simply a bit out-of-shape, primarily due to lack of physical exercising, and no fixed eating routine. As much as our society emphasizes women to strive and take all possible measures to maintain a fair complexion in order to supposedly ease their lives a bit, men are reminded time and again that their protruding tummies are not only obstacles in their path towards greatness, along with being sights assumedly abhorred by women around them, but they might end up causing cardiovascular diseases—shortening their agonized lives.
I had a week off from university so I decided that it might be the right time to get started with jogging as nearly all my pants were gradually giving up on me by getting a bit tighter around the waist; not a pleasant development. On one fine evening, during that off-week, I ringed a friend of mine who was somewhat of an athlete, and invited them (or requested him) to jog with me as I required the presence of such an individual around me who would keep persuading me to test my limits as we would run at a steady pace for prolonged sessions. Tough ask, one might say, but I was very determined.
Considering our crisscrossed schedules, we decided that we would go for jogging after dusk. Being young folks, it was not only a challenge for us to get up early in the morning, but we had an idea that during the early hours of the day, the track would mostly be inhibited with older folks in their fifties or sixties, who maintain a casual gait whilst sharing their insights on matters of politics, religion, and cricket; thus it would be tough for us to zigzag through them considering their abundance and pace.
We met at the track on the set time and date, and got going with our business. Initially, we took faster steps just to build some momentum, afterwards we began running. As we briskly made our way through the track, we came across all sorts of people attempting to get rid of the extra kgs they had gained. After having run hardly a hundred meters, I realized that I was gasping for breath; my heart was pounding heavily, my face turned red, the muscles in my legs seemed to be quite sore, and I couldn't think straight. I stopped for a while trying to catch my breath whereas my pal, taking pity on my condition, halted a little ahead of me though they would have run the entire track without requiring any short breaks.
I realized then and there that jogging was not for me. Cut off regular supply of oxygen to the mind and you enter a whole new world. You start seeing, and comprehending things very differently. Still catching my breath while resuming our walk with quicker steps, I observed that there were so many skinny guys jogging on the track; they lacked bulging bellies, and appeared to be in great nick. I started to despise them. Since they were in perfect shape, why on earth did they felt the need to undergo this struggle, this battle between the mind and the body—in which, none seemed to be winning for sure? They could have opted heading to an American burger chain right now, savoring the signature meal they offered with double beef patty, extra cheese, and upsizing the whole order in order to relish the increased quantity of fries, and Coke. But, no, they preferred jogging. The extent of irrationality of these individuals greatly surprised and disappointed me, and I questioned their sanity.
After a while, a young couple overtook us. With earphones plugged in, they were running at a steady pace, and neither of them showed any signs of fatigue whereas I was clearly struggling to walk in a straight path. For a while, it seemed rather cute to me, and I thought of someone special. However, my mind was alive enough to bring me back to reality, and make me loathe the very activity of jogging as it had turned every single muscle in my lower body sore as if there was a protest going on within me. And that that someone special didn't exist—for now. After these bitter realities dawned upon me, the earlier recorded observation ceased being cute, and I started to feel a bit nauseous.
The athletic friend of mine spotted some exercising equipment, and headed towards them. I followed him, though to me, it seemed more agony. My friend used all the equipment quite well, and performed a number of exercises, including chin-ups, push-ups, dips, planks, burpees, and others whose names I know not. I simply stood there and watched them and the other folks loosen themselves. Though I was instructed by my athletic friend to try some stretches on a flat horizontal structure, I simply lay there and gazed at the heavens above. I felt so tired that I could've had a short nap there. My pal approached me. The disappointment over their face due to my lack of interest in the exercises or the process of jogging was clearly noticeable. After a while we resumed running.
The kilometer-long jogging track seemed to be endless. I was excessively perspiring. I wanted to drink a gallon or two of chilled water. I questioned my decision of embarking on this painful journey. Why was I doing this to myself? I wasn't born to be a sportsman, as it was them who need to jog. Was my body really in an awful state? If I don't die as a result of a heart-attack due to obesity, I would most certainly pass away due to jogging as I felt the blood-pumping organ giving up on me. How nice would it have been if I were in my room right now, getting done with that novel I started yesterday? Instead of asking this athletic friend of mine to jog with me, I could have asked them to come to this new café, and try their molten lava cake, as I had heard that it was really good. I didn't really need to jog. May be I might have to in the later part of my life, but not now. I would control my diet. Yes, I would most certainly do that. I will try to limit the intake of carbonated beverages, reduce the consumption of fast food, and consult YouTube for some indoor exercises which would facilitate me getting back to shape.
And thus, I committed with myself. No jogging, but precautionary measures. I could sense my body temperature on the rise. Finally, the end of the track appeared in sight. I was delighted though I felt lifeless. I wanted a crowd of people to gather towards the end, and congratulate me over this magnanimous achievement. I wanted some significant personality to hand over a trophy or a check of several million rupees to me as a result of the momentous landmark I had achieved. Where was the media? Why didn't I see any photographers? As we finally completed one round of the track, I stood there bent, hands on knees, looking at the ground, happy to know that it was all over. Or that is what I had in mind:
‘One more round.'
‘What?'
‘Come on. One round isn't going to do you any good. We've got to do at least a couple more.'
‘Are you nuts? I'm about to die here, and you want a couple more rounds?'
(Pointing towards my unattractive abdomen) ‘Do you want that thing to go in or not?'
‘I most certainly do, but this will take time, you know. I believe that we had a good start today. We'll do two tracks tomorrow for sure.'
(Sniffs) ‘Well, all right. Don't forget to do a bit of stretching when you get home or your sore muscles will kill you.'
‘Absolutely! Thanks for coming. See you tomorrow.'
I got home, and reached for my bed to rest for a while. I didn't realize when I went to sleep, but when I got up, it was early next morning. My sore legs were indeed killing me. I texted my friend that jogging with them turned out to be a wonderful experience but I won't be able to continue as I had to go out of city to spend the rest of my vacations with cousins, but we'll definitely stay in touch. I lied. I got to know how people felt when they dumped someone: Hey, you know what? I think we're great friends and I would want us to remain that way, but we can't be together anymore.
Jogging turned out to be quite an ordeal for me. It certainly wasn't as simple a task as they portrayed it in Hollywood productions. I was definitely going to look for lesser demanding alternatives to that extensive physical toiling as I needed to cope with the shrinking clothes dilemma; after all, I'm not fat. I would never say that.
Manchester City: Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has said their team would not concede defeat in the Premier League title race if they were in the same position as Manchester United.
United manager Jose Mourinho conceded the title to runaway leaders City for the first time on Friday with the 20-times champions running second, 15 points behind City with 13 games left.
Asked ahead of City's trip to seventh-placed Burnley on Saturday if they would give up in Mourinho's position, Guardiola said: "No, I don't think so. That is not going to happen.
"We have shown even in our two defeats this season that we will try until the very end. We play every game to give sense to what we are doing. I know the 15-point distance is quite big at the moment. It's the same gap from six games ago.
"In football and in sport, anything can happen. You are good today but tomorrow you are bad. The most important thing we have done is to focus. In my experience, until everything is done, you have to be prepared for anything to happen."
City have endured a hectic season having progressed to the Champions League last 16, the FA Cup fifth round and the League Cup final apart from dominating the league and Guardiola said they would rest their players following the Burnley game.
"After the game against Burnley until next Wednesday the players will be resting," Guardiola added.
"The players can do whatever they want, they can travel or whatever. If they want to go and find some sunshine or stay here in Manchester, they can do what they like. They are free."
Indian team today registered a comprehensive win against the Sri Lankan team by an innings and 171 runs on the third day of the third and final Test match to sweep the series 3-0 at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium.
Chasing the first innings deficit of 352 runs, Sri Lanka were bowled out for 181 in the second innings. For India, off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin grabbed four wickets and pacer Mohammad Shami three.
Shikhar Dhawan is the Man of the Series: “Before the series, I was in Hong Kong enjoying my holiday. Things went very well for me. I got backup from my management, i enjoy playing this way, it's my natural game. I've to keep doing i, nothing permanent, we have tight competition for all positions.”
Hardik Pandya is the Man of the Match: “I was glad that I got my first hundred here, situation pretty good for me. I was always going to have a target in mind. Test cricket is not easy to get five-fors, takes plenty of hardwork. I'm alright with where the team needs me to bat.”
Virat Kohli: “A good day, a good win. Always nice to have a convincing win. I would say the regulars have performed, the biggest positive was Hardik's inclusions – they give us a boost in the middle order. We are a young side, looking forward to all Tests, that's the only way you can be ruthless. We like to be proactive instead of reactive.”
Frightening images out of California amid the Oroville Dam crisis has Connecticut officials reassuring the public that our dam system is in good condition and that the state is at low-risk for that type of scenario.
Nearly 200,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes after the Oroville Dam approached capacity and the spillway designed to deal with that developed a 200-foot sinkhole. Now, to prevent an even bigger catastrophe, officials are releasing water at a rate of nearly 750,000 gallons a second, which is more water than an Olympic size swimming pool.
Those people have now been allowed back to their homes, but have been warned they could be evacuated again.
According to Jennifer Perry, from Connecticut's Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, "Connecticut has nothing of that scale. We're talking about orders of magnitude smaller than what's out there."
"We believe our dams are in good condition. We know what the condition of those dams are. We are able to direct where the resources need to go in order to keep those dams in good condition," they added.
There are 4,500 dams in Connecticut, all regulated by the state. But following state legislation in 2013, all of those dams are now required to be inspected on a regular schedule and assessed a hazard level.
"About 550 of them are considered to be a higher significant hazard, which means if the dam were to fail, then there is a potential for loss of life downstream," Perry said.
That's concerning to those who live and work downstream in areas throughout the state, like near the Rainbow Dam in Windsor.
"It's concerning because it really can affect us downstream here. It's a lot of water that can be released all at once if there is any kind of catastrophic failure," said Donald Trinks, owner of Bart's Drive In in Windsor.
While Perry said the state isn't in danger of an Oroville situation, we could be in jeopardy if Connecticut doesn't keep up with our dam infrastructure.
"Knowing that there is an enormous need for an investment in our own infrastructure to keep people safe, yeah it can make it tough to sleep sometimes," they said.
Carl Camden, president and CEO of Kelly Services, talks with a student after an open forum for the search for the next president of Oakland University on Monday, April 17, 2017. Photo by Natalie Broda / Digital First Media
Carl Camden, president and CEO of Kelly Services, fielded questions from the Oakland University campus community starting at 10 a.m. on Monday, April 17 in the banquet rooms of the Oakland Center as a part of the search for the universitys next president.
Camden is one of two finalists vying for the position. The second candidate is expected to be announced on Tuesday, April 18.
Camden began the forum by sharing that they were the first in their family to go to college, tearing up when touching on the subject of the teachers who helped get them there. Since the announcement of their candidacy for the position became public, Camden has decided to step down as president and CEO at Kelly Services effective May 10.
The campus community asked questions from many different sectors, from tenure to student anxiety to what Camdens overall vision for the university is. For several specifics, such as how Camden envisions arts at the university in three years, Camden declined to comment stating they didnt have enough information yet and would spend the majority of their first 100-days learning about the university to understand those specifics.

Here are some of the questions and answers posed by campus to Camden during the forum:
 Q: How will you manage the distrust some feel about your background coming from corporate America and not higher education?
In all three of my jobs I was an outsider coming in Ive been careful to not answer questions that I dont know the answers to listening has worked and alignment of needs has worked. In the past, spending time listening and understanding and aligning the needs has been the most important step I could take. The distrust just based on the title that they have I would prefer to think what were trained in an openness to new ideas and thoughts.
 Q: How would you support the arts in conjunction with science, technology, engineering and math?
Im not anti-arts, Im a big advocate for liberal arts, but as someone who employs people I can tell you STEM is our greatest unmet demand regardless of how many graduates were producing...but there should be plenty of focus on all the liberal arts What do we do about the 40-some-percent of the population thats going to graduate from high school and probably wont go on to any vocational or college degree program? Good jobs dont really exist much anymore, were returning to a world of craftsmen, tradesmen how do we build a benefit structure for those types of careers?
If you look at where tech resides, California, New York the greater Detroit area is one of the top four markets in the nation for that but none of us are taking ownership of that segment of the emerging market.
Camden declined to offer details on how they see the art program growing at the University until they had more information on what was currently being done.
 Q: Should Oakland University focus on being a community-oriented university or focus on becoming a big research university?
Camden said they wouldnt comment until hes had time to talk with the entire campus community in the first 100 days.
 Q: What does diversity look like to you in higher education?
It is true that Ive been challenging the team (at Kelly Services) to not get involved in a group think so that everybody present doesnt think the same way, or come from the same neighborhoods. Ive been concerned at Kelly that we have a variety of economic backgrounds and in addition to all of the traditional methods of diversity it doesnt do as much good to achieve that it everyone thinks and talks the same way, its inefficient. Are we making opportunities for those economically disadvantaged rather than just assuming that by bringing in racial diversity we somehow manage to accommodate that we need different experiential backgrounds and different cultural backgrounds.
 Q: What is your dream for study abroad at Oakland University?
We need to bring the international community to us we go back to the question on diversity, cultural diversity is a really important variable, we need to celebrate and do everything we can to keep ourselves from becoming a monoculture. It needs to be based on as many different variables as we can, but I understand the politics that are in play, the workers moving around the world maybe not in three years but we can fix it. .
 Q: What about funding methods for the university?
Given the inflation rate, we wont be able to get back where we were, its higher than GDP growth ... But how do we deliver a quality education? What were not doing is taking full advantage of the technology platforms I dont know fully what Oakland University is doing now, but I will work to help to find what we have to do.
 Q: What is the role and vision of health and wellbeing on a college campus?
Thats a tough question I dont buy that its the student fault, so what will we do as an institution? And I dont know which measures are in place here but I do know we spike higher on those trying to parent, get a degree, and none of that comes easy. Its hard. The question is always like with any system, whats taking place thats causing the biggest drop in completion rates? The greatest work/life imbalance? Its not a bad vision to have work revolve around life (instead of vice-versa).
 Q: What solutions have worked in your experience for women (to make the work-climate more hospitable for women)?
Kelly has a 50 percent plus female office, and my board is almost 50 percent women so its been a long enterprise ... Ill tell you at Kelly it was a decision to focus on feeding into the system and oversize the number of new hires and watch them move up through the ranks I dont have any solutions but we will be listening.
 Q: What do you think about tenure?
Not everyone needs to be on a tenure track, but how much is needed to maintain the research output and level of academic freedom? Thats an issue for the unions and for the administration. If we dont have that discussion then well let it happen by happenstance and what I dont see taking place at universities Ive been advising is a firm culture and discussion. The answer isnt 100 percent (tenure), it never has been. If I come here, will you work with me to say this is what we want Oakland University to be? Can we get there? Ill support that all day, but if its an emotional argument of we should replace people with tenure and non-tenure track . Lets decide what our mission is and get specific with our mission.
 Q: What is the overall vision?
In my opinion the strategic plan here is less actionable and when I look at all the other plans, which is what we do, and see how does it tie into the capital plans, you see very little word-lift, so it has the right thoughts but its not driving the universitys behavior or actionable results. I want a plan that is referenced everywhere in the university. We have a set of disjointed plans. You cant consider the strategic plan in isolation of the others. Our part of the system is to be a four year and graduate university and ive talked equally about that. When I talk about the strategic plan and how do those parts fit together, I mean what is the relationship with the granting institutions and the two years colleges? Are we working with them to attract from them?
Im not looking for significant cultural and political reform. We as a university share the (same kind of mission as a corporation) if you look at our funding. Keep the company competitive. It is part of what we do and why the government funds us. Im not talking about the end of tenure, I think tenure is vital. I think the thought is, is that approaching it as vague goal rather than a specific goal is being intellectually lazy.
How many of you know the first sentence of the mission statement? Im telling you thats the problem...We get to be a major source of education and effective citizens in a society and environment where our students will be first and second generation graduates. We are to provide programs of excellence and nobody ever said I dont think were filling those. What Im saying is that we can do better. We can do more You dont have the facilities you need, you dont have the level of funding you need to support students and faculty the way you want to. Im not attacking what weve done but we can do more and doing more doesnt mean what were doing is bad, it just means we have to do more.

John Obi Mikel of Nigeria looks on before the international friendly soccer match between Argentina and Nigeria at the FK Krasnodar Stadium, in Krasnodar, Russia, 14 November 2017. EPA-EFE/YURI KOCHETKOV
Before Nigeria were due to play Argentina in a crunch group clash, captain John Obi Mikel was told their elderly father had been kidnapped. They told no one and played on.
Stay up to date with all the latest news from Russia with Daily Maverick's dedicated World Cup 2018 section.
After Nigeria lost to Argentina in their final group stage of the 2018 World Cup, John Obi Mikel was visibly emotional. Understandably so. The Super Eagles had come within a few minutes of knocking Lionel Messi's side out of the tournament and progressing to the last 16.
In their post-match interviews, they appeared distracted, as you might expect from a captain. Nigeria, the youngest side at this year's World Cup, had showed so much promise, but so little return.
It wasn't until a few days later that the picture came into full view. Right before kick-off, Mikel would learn that their father had been kidnapped and they were being held for ransom.
Pa Michael Obi, was made to walk 5km in the rain, barefoot and held at gunpoint. Obi Jr paid over the ransom of about R380,000 and their father, a man in their 60s, was eventually released.
At no point before the match did Mikel ever say anything to their teammates or their coaches because they did not want to distract them.
They told The Guardian: “I played while my father was in the hands of bandits. I had to suppress the trauma. I took a call four hours before kick-off to tell me what had happened.
“I was emotionally distraught and I had to make the decision about whether I was mentally ready to play. I was confused. I did not know what to do but, in the end, I knew that I could not let 180-million Nigerians down.”
Police confirmed the incident. Superintendent Ebere Amaraizu, of Enugu State Police Command, said: “The abductors started calling to demand a ransom of N10-million before police operatives acted on intelligence information and swooped on them.
“In the process of the rescue, a gun duel ensued between police operatives and the kidnappers which forced the hoodlums to abandon their victims inside the forest and they were promptly rescued.”
It wasn't even the first time. Back in 2011, while Mikel was playing for Chelsea, their father was beaten before being released. While their father was at the mercy of kidnappers, they played two games for the London club because that's their job. Former Everton defender Joseph Yobo's brother was kidnapped also in 2008, before being released two weeks later.
For most of us, this is unfathomable. For Mikel, and so many others in Nigeria, it is reality. The Boko Haram kidnapping of school girls over the course of the last four years put a spotlight on the issues, but in a news cycle that is perpetually filled with dark realities, it is far too easily forgotten.
Earlier this year, CBC reported on the scourge of kidnappings that are spreading across the country. In most cases, the victims are released unharmed by their “common criminal” kidnappers who are only in it for a quick buck.
Let all that sink in for a minute. You are about to captain your country at a World Cup. At the most important game of the tournament.
A lot has been written about the failure of African teams and the global tournament throughout the years, but far too little is made of the challenges faced by the players and the individuals who often fly quietly under the radar.
Mikel is not a showman and in the grander scheme of things, they have little to prove. During their time with Chelsea, they won two Premier League titles, four FA Cups (he received a medal in 2010, despite missing the final through injury), two League Cups, one Europa League and, most famously, one Champions League.
Some still feel that they have failed to live up to the same potential in national colours, but their worth comes through more than just trophies and their response to the ordeal is another example of that.
Under coach Gernot Rohr, Mikel has thrived. The two make a fine pair. Rohr, the astute tactician and analyst and Mikel, the diplomat who prefers a gentle approach to soothing issues rather than the hot-headed confrontations that have plagued the Super Eagles in the past. There is no need for either to demand respect, it just happens.
The World Cup exit will sting, it is rarely just about the game for African stars. Mikel must tow the line of being a statesman and a patron, not just to their country, but to the continent.
 They are loyal to their charity, the Mikel Obi Africa Children's Sport Foundation, where they hope to set up academies across Africa and help alleviate poverty through sport.
And then they still have to deal with speaking out on the realities of crime that their fellow countrymen face. Mikel told the BBC this week:
“Life is already tough on people, then they have to start living in fear when they are going about looking for means of survival. I want to encourage our government to continue its relentless efforts and fights on factions that create fear and insecurity in our country.
“My father was hurt and tortured during their ordeal and this is unacceptable. I hope that the authorities will work harder to bring these bandits to justice. Representing my country is my greatest honour, I love my country and very proud to be a Nigerian.”
Few other continents have teams that demand so much of their top sports people. And yet, far too often, Africa's players get the short end of the praise stick for their sacrifice.
The Congressional Budget Office believes 14 million people would lose health care coverage in 2018 under the Republican's proposed plan.
President Donald Trump will try to rally Americans behind that plan.
He'll be in Ypsilanti on Wednesday.
Monday they hosted a White House listening session with Americans who say Obamacare failed them, but the White House is bracing for some bad headlines about their plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Democrats say the bill has nothing to do with health care, and argue the GOP plan shrinks aid to the poor while cutting taxes for the wealthy.
Outside groups predict 10 to 15 million Americans will lose coverage, but supporters say it's about choice.
The Congressional Budget Office also says the GOP plan would save the federal government $337 billion over ten years.

EDINBURGH-A Scottish addiction clinic has begun treating people who are hooked on trading cryptocurrencies.
Traders can become addicted to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin as their volatile price fluctuations can be as thrilling but potentially costly as gambling, according to therapists at Castle Craig clinic near Edinburgh.
Cryptocurrency addicts are offered treatments such as a 12-step programme, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), trauma therapy and equine therapy.
Chris Burn, a gambling therapist at Castle Craig Hospital, said: “The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler.
“It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It's a classic bubble situation,” they said. Castle Craig has treated over 10,000 patients for various addictions since it opened in 1988, and says the majority have gone on to achieve long-term abstinent recovery.
Prices start from £1,360 per week for an extended treatment programme, and detox and intensive care starts from £2,975 per week.
A single en suite bedroom in Castle Craig's intensive treatment programme costs £4,970 per week, and the cost of its “executive programme” starts at £9,240 per week. A minimum commitment of two weeks' treatment is required of all patients.
Patients or families who struggle to afford residential rehabilitation are offered advice on alternative and more affordable treatment options, and potentially external funding from Scotland's National Health Service.
‘Stop the Violence' event kicks off summer vacation for Dunbar kids
An event aimed at keeping students safe during summer vacation kicked off Wednesday afternoon in Dunbar.
Organizers of the 12th Annual Stop the Violence event hope it will bridge the gap between the community and police.
“This will be one of those days that you are close and have that one-on-one with the police department that you're not afraid to talk to them,” said Taunya Cola, Dunbar Neighborhood Watch.
Last year, July was ranked as the second highest month fro crimes in Fort Myers. The goal of the event is to keep children out of trouble during the summer and keep the community united.
“We can get all these kids from different communities from Harlem Lakes, Renaissance, all the places that are feuding to come together in one hub,” Cola said.

What are Collections and how the heck do they work?
Instagram:
Starting this week, you can save posts into private collections.
Last year in December, Instagram introduced a feature that allowed users to save posts so they could view them at a later time.
This tool was great if you were one of those people who constantly screenshotted everything they wanted to remember, or tagged yourself in the comments in order to get the notification to remind you to go back and view the post, and nearly 46 per cent of Instagrammers has saved at least one post since this feature rolled out.
Today, Instagram announced something called Collections, a feature that lets users sort any IG post they've bookmarked into different categories for easy viewing & organizing!
How does it work?
After you save an Instagram photo or video that you'd like to revisit, you get a prompt that asks you if you want to add it to a previously made Collection, or if you want to create a new Collection altogether.
Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy!
Instagram:
Tap and hold the bookmark icon underneath any post to save it directly to a collection. You can create and name a new collection when you save a post, or you can add it to one you've already created. You can also create a collection out of your existing saved posts. Tap the plus icon in the top right corner, give your collection a name and select the saved posts you'd like to add.
Why would people want to use collections?
It totally depends! But some people may not want their puppy posts and the NSFW work posts touching.
It makes it real awkward to explain to people who accidentally see your saved posts…
How many Collections can I have?
We're not quite sure yet, although the screenshots from Instagram so far show four collections.
When will this be available?
The Collections feature is rolling out for iOS and Android users this week!
Will you be sortin' with Collections?
Are you a big fan of Instagram's save post feature, or do you think saving posts and using Collections is just another way to complicate things?
Let us know if you're interested in using collections in the comments below!

Real Madrid on Wednesday (Jul 4) denied media reports they have made a bid for Paris Saint-Germain's teenage striker Kylian Mbappe, who is emerging as one of the biggest stars of the Russia World Cup.
Social media user Baptiste Ripart, who identifies themselves as a journalist and editor, said in a Twitter posting that the Spanish Champions League holders had agreed a world-record 272 million euro (239.75 million pounds) fee for the French 19-year-old.

Real Madrid issued their denial after Spanish sports dailies Marca and AS ran articles citing the posting.
"Given the information published ... regarding an alleged agreement between Real Madrid and PSG for the player Kylian Mbappe, Real Madrid would like to state that it is completely false," the club said in a statement on their website.
"Real Madrid has not made any offer to PSG or the player and condemns the spreading of this type of information."
With speculation rife that world player of the year Cristiano Ronaldo will soon leave Real, the Madrid club also on Monday denied a report that they had offered 310 million euros for Mbappe's Brazilian PSG strike partner Neymar.

PSG signed Mbappe on an initial year-long loan deal from AS Monaco last year with an option to buy after one season. That deal was reported to be worth 180 million euros.
Mbappe has so far scored three World Cup goals, including two in France 4-3 round-of-16 victory over Argentina. France face Uruguay in a quarter-final in Nizhny Novgorod on Friday.

Southampton have sacked manager Claude Puel, the Premier League club said in a statement on Wednesday.
LONDON: Southampton sacked manager Claude Puel after less than a year on Wednesday as the Frenchman paid the price for a dismal end to the season.
Puel led Southampton to the League Cup final in February, but a 3-2 defeat to Manchester United ended their hopes of silverware and was followed by a woeful run of results in the run-in.
Southampton won only one of their final eight league games, scoring just one goal in their last five home matches. They finished eighth in the table with their lowest points tally in four years.
"Southampton Football Club can today confirm that it has terminated the contract of Claude Puel with immediate effect," the club said in a statement.
"Everyone at Southampton would like to express our thanks to Claude for their hard work and commitment this year."

Following the departure of Ronald Koeman to Everton, the 55-year-old Puel joined the club last June, after spending four years at French side Nice.
The club had finished sixth under Koeman in 2015-16, but Puel's league results were mixed throughout the campaign.
They did enjoy success in the League Cup, however, eliminating Arsenal in the quarter-finals, before beating Liverpool home and away in the semi-final to get to Wembley.
Their run was halted in the final, however, as United's Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice, including an 87th-minute winner.
"The highlight of the season was a memorable day at Wembley in the EFL Cup final, a day our fans will always treasure," Southampton added in their statement.
Former Southampton great Matt Le Tissier told Sky Sports that it was Puel's failure to entertain fans that ultimately cost them their job.
"I think the main sticking point was the lack of goals and the lack of entertaining football," Le Tissier said.
"No goals in the last five home games was a big factor. I am afraid that was what cost them their job.
"There is a lot of sympathy when you look at the eighth-place finish and cup final. On paper, it doesn't look a bad season, but if you have watched a lot of games this season, it has been a backward step."
The club said the search for a new manager was already underway and they were confident of finding the right fit for the club's "long term vision".
Former Borussia Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel was the early bookmakers' favourite to replace Puel.

The European Commission proposed on Wednesday to double funding for the Erasmus student exchange programme, hoping to get more youngsters into the popular scheme that aims to promote people's European identity.
BRUSSELS: The European Commission proposed on Wednesday to double funding for the Erasmus student exchange programme, hoping to get more youngsters into the popular scheme that aims to promote people's European identity.
The proposal appears aimed to combat rising nationalism and euroscepticism that led to Britain's vote to quit the bloc and political turmoil in Italy, a country where widespread support for the European Union has given way to increasing resentment.

"Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance for the Union's future," the Commission said in its proposal for a 30 billion euro (US$35 billion) budget for 2021-2027, up from 14.7 billion euros in the current seven-year period.
"Every euro that we invest in Erasmus is an investment in our future," Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen said of the scheme that allows university students to spend a year studying in another EU member state.
"It is the very essence of a borderless Europe," they added.
The proposal, which requires the approval of member states, would triple the number of participants to 12 million in the next seven-year period and would expand it to youth workers, school pupils, trainees and sports coaches.

Bengaluru: Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy will present the Congress-JDS coalition government's maiden budget on Thursday, amid high expectations of farm loan waiver.
In the run-up to the recent Assembly polls, the Kumaraswamy-led JD(S) had promised to waive farm loans borrowed both from cooperative and nationalised banks within 24 hours of coming to power.
Kumaraswamy, who also holds the finance portfolio, had earlier cited coalition compulsions and the need for studying the financial condition of the state as the reason for the delay in the announcement of loan waiver.
Financial experts and some government officials have already expressed concern over the impact loan waiver may have on the state's finances.
It will also be interesting to see how Kumaraswamy, who has in the past claimed that they are not an expert on the economy, will strike a balance between loan waiver, flagship schemes of the previous government, new schemes or programmes if any, as also infrastructure needs of the state.
The Congress-JD(S) coordination committee constituted to oversee the smooth functioning of the government had on Sunday approved the Common Minimum Programme, which includes waiver of farm loans, the creation of one crore jobs and allocation of Rs 1.25 lakh crore for irrigation over the next five years.
It also included construction of 20 lakh houses for homeless families in the state in the next five years, along with the implementation of a universal health policy, 'Arogya Karnataka' of the previous government, among others.
The budget also comes amid coalition worries and debate over whether there was a need for a full-fledged fresh budget as the government would continue almost all the flagship schemes of the previous government.
Former chief minister and Coordination committee chief Siddaramaiah, who held the finance portfolio in the previous government, had recently said there was no need for a fresh budget and insisted that a supplementary budget would do.
Adding to the coalition's discomfort is the controversy over videos that purportedly showed coordination committee chairperson Siddaramaiah's remarks, questioning the need for a fresh budget and expressing scepticism over the longevity of the government.
On the other hand, the opposition BJP has demanded that Kumaraswamy come out with a "white paper" on the state's financial position before presenting the budget.
Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly BS Yeddyurappa has warned that if the government fails to keep up its promises on loan waiver, BJP and all its 104 MLAs would go to the people with the Congress and JD(S) manifestos to inform them that the parties have not 'walked the talk.'
Meanwhile, Karnataka Legislative Assembly Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar on Wednesday sounded a note of caution about loan waiver becoming a "fashion".
Taking note of the discussions regarding farm loan waiver, they questioned why no one was talking about making farmer capable of paying back.
Stating that it is true that loan waiver was needed to relieve farmers in distress, Kumar said "but let loan waiver not become a fashion."
In what is being seen as an effort by Congress to claim its share of credit for the farm loan waiver, keeping in mind the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, party President Rahul Gandhi today expressed confidence about the Congress-JDS coalition government acting on its commitment to waive farmer loans and to make farming more profitable.
"On the eve of the Karnataka Budget, I'm confident our Congress-JDS coalition Govt will act on our commitment to waive farmer loans & to make farming more profitable," they said in a tweet.
"This budget is an opportunity for our Govt. to make Karnataka a beacon of hope for farmers all across India," they said.

A local Farmer's Market is blossoming thanks to tens of thousands of dollars in grant money.
The USDA gave Farwell $93,000, and the village donated another $22,000 to renovate their Farmer's Market building.
They've added a new sidewalk, new outdoor signs, a bathroom, a pavilion, and picnic tables.
The Farmer's Market manager credits the improvements for quadrupling the number of vendors. There used to be only three vendors when it first started six years ago, and now there's more than 20.
“I'm very excited about this, I dumped my heart and soul into this,” said Farmer's Market Manager Tracy Lee. When they put this in my lap I didn't know how to run a Farmer's Market and I was like you want me to run a Farmer's Market?"
That's not the only grant the village received.
Another $113,000 in grant money will be used to add ADA compliance walkways, a picnic pavilion, and a new playground to Farwell Park.

Football coaches constitute the only subset of the population that describes injuries geographically — as in, a player with an ACL tear is “out with a knee,” or worse yet, “has a knee.” Well, don't we all?
When pressed for details, the same group will provide an injury prognosis in the terms of minutes and hours, as if recoveries can be measured with an egg timer. If you are not currently in uniform for many major programs — whether it's with a head cold, an ankle sprain or an amputation — you're labeled “day to day.” Yeah, but aren't we all?
Spend a few years reporting on this sport and you'll find that for every coach sent down from the heavens to fill notepads with dazzling quotes and information, there are five coaches who'd rather hand out their PIN code than divulge details about the status of their roster.
Consider that for every Northwestern, which under Pat Fitzgerald issues injury reports before every game, there's a Michigan, which doesn't even create a depth chart. It's incredible that Jim Harbaugh can't win a rivalry game despite holding the element of surprise.
SIGNAL CALLERS: Ranking the best quarterbacks in college football
ARMOUR: Why college football player's death should terrify parents
TOP 10: The toughest places to win in Power Five conferences
Spend five minutes talking with a random college coach about a controversial topic — say, transfer regulations — and you'll leave certain the coach believes Oswald didn't act alone, or that the moon landing was staged. By and large, this is a secretive, closemouthed group of individuals who want nothing more than to say little and share even less.
So you should expect some backlash among coaching circles when it comes to the proposal suggested last month by the Big Ten Conference, which has asked the NCAA to look into creating a national system for reporting injuries across the Football Bowl Subdivision, per CBSSports.com. Mandating weekly reports would run contrary to coaching logic, which goes something like this: What's mine isn't just mine — it's proprietary.
“Whatever weaknesses or vulnerabilities that we have as a team, I can't possibly fathom why I would have any interest in revealing that to my opponent,” Washington State coach Mike Leach said this winter in an interview with USA TODAY Sports. That mindset pervades the profession.
But coaches need to get on board with the idea of weekly injury reports, which would be a positive in the generic sense and a nearly mandatory addition as national gambling laws begin to wield their impact on the sport.
For starters, an NCAA-issued edict demanding weekly reports in the vein of the NFL, which hands out three lists each week ending with a final tally on Fridays, would remove the inane and mind-numbing gamesmanship seen at Michigan and elsewhere.
Contrary to public perception, Nick Saban openly discusses injuries, if grumpily. Michigan, for example, has gained nothing from playing things close to the vest; if anything, doing so has made Harbaugh look foolish — as if opponents need a depth chart to know the Wolverines are going to run on first down, run on second and throw on third.
Likely the most impactful on-field benefit to stem from injury reports is the uniformity it would bring across programs and conferences. Getting each Power Five conference to adopt a similar nine-game league schedule is more and more an impossibility, to name one contentious topic. On this the Power Five should agree: There is nothing to lose — no inherent advantage or disadvantage for any one program — in providing a weekly report listing which players will not play on a given Saturday.
On an individual level, it's one fewer thing for coaches to worry about. Coaches treat football, a game, like it's high-level mathematics. It's not physics; it's football. Take the topic out of the hands of coaches and athletic departments because both groups have shown themselves unable to shake the idea that the information is copyrighted.
Besides, injuries shouldn't be treated like the recipe for Coke. The entire sphere of college football, from coaches through the media, need to toss aside the tired and frankly embarrassing notion that football is a sport of gladiators, that injuries are a symbol of weakness. It's idiotic, for one, and totally unsuitable to the era. We need to talk about injuries because the most important topic facing this sport isn't the amateur model but player safety. There are few better ways to discuss injuries than to make them an open topic every week within each program in the FBS.
And then there's gambling. In May the Supreme Court struck down a 1992 law banning state-authorized sports gambling, with Nevada the exception. Seven states have since followed Nevada's lead: Delaware, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. More will follow. More gambling is coming to college football, and the NCAA needs to get on board.
The NCAA could buck at the idea of even tacitly endorsing gambling; this is after all an outfit that steadfastly clings to an athletic model decades removed from relevancy. Foresight and the NCAA are two words rarely used in the same sentence. Yet here's why the NCAA should and will get on the board: Gambling is going to be a moneymaker.
The positives far outweigh the negatives — because there are no negatives to nationally standardized injury reports. Coaches would have to unlearn old habits. The NCAA would have to acknowledge the inevitable impact gambling will have on its model. But both sides need to catch up with the times.

Jeremy Corbyn is hitting the Home Counties with a promise to tackle the housing crisis as they continue their blitz of marginal parliamentary seats.
The Labour leader is campaigning to unseat Tory MPs with slim majorities in Reading and Milton Keynes under a plan to keep their party on a general election footing.
Mr Corbyn will highlight rocketing house prices and attack the Government for "giving tax breaks to the wealthy".
At a rally in Milton Keynes, they are expected to say: "The Conservative Government has spent seven years giving tax breaks to the wealthy, who don't need them, while making it harder for most people in our country to make ends meet.
"Here in Milton Keynes, like so many towns and cities across the country, the cost of housing is sky-rocketing - house prices have gone up 50% in five years.
"The next Labour government will tackle the housing crisis.
"We will create a new Department for Housing and build 100,000 homes a year by the end of the next Parliament.
"Housing should be about homes for the many, not investment opportunities for the few.
" Commuters from Milton Keynes to London have seen rail fares increasing faster than their wages year in, year out.
"Labour will bring down fares by returning our rail system to public ownership, putting more money in people's pockets and making sure our railways are run in the interests of people, not profit.
" The Government has no plan to help people struggling to get by.
"The price of everyday goods keeps going up faster than wages.
"Labour will introduce a real living wage of £10 an hour, scrap the public sector pay cap and take action to reduce utility bills through bringing public services back into public hands, to keep household costs down.
"Labour is campaigning right across our country this summer, putting forward our plan for a country that works for the many not the few."
The Conservatives held Reading West with a majority of 2,876 and Milton Keynes North with 1,915 votes.
It's no secret that having babies in the United States is expensive business. As new parents quickly discover after bringing their newborns home — usually when those terrifying hospital bills start rolling in — labor and delivery fees, as well as postnatal care for mom and baby, cost a pretty penny. What's particularly frustrating is that the cost of having a baby varies widely from state to state. And don't even get me started on how the U.S. compares with other industrialized countries. *Shudders* But if you really want to put everything into perspective, here's how much the royal delivery cost compared to how much U.S. moms have to pay.
On Monday, April 23, Prince William and Kate Middleton welcomed their third child, People reported. As with their previous births, Middleton delivered in the private Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital in London. The baby boy weighed in at 8 pounds, 7 ounces, and no name has been announced yet. While it's true that Middleton left the hospital only seven hours after delivering the new prince, they did enjoy top-of-the-line accommodations during their stay, Time reported. These included: "Access to state-of-the-art equipment, WiFi, modern decor, daily newspapers, meals prepared by on-site chefs and afternoon tea," and more, according to a Lindo Wing informational document, the publication reported.
So how does the cost of a royal delivery compare to what moms in the U.S. pay, you ask? On average, U.S. moms are actually paying more for a normal — and non-royal — delivery than what Kate Middleton shells out for the royal birthing experience, Time reported. For real. I'll just let that sink in for a moment.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders shared a chart on Tuesday that showed the costs of delivering the royal baby came to $8,900. For moms in the U.S., the cost is roughly $10,808, and that's without all the royal bells and whistles (and a much higher maternal mortality risk...).
So let's take a look at numbers, here, shall we? The Lindo Wing's maternity prices document shows that Prince William and Middleton will be responsible for at least £6,275 (roughly $8,000) for one night in a deluxe room. They might have also opted to reserve a suite for an additional fee, which would bring the bill up to $9,650, Us Weekly reported. According to data from FAIR Health, the average cost of a vaginal, no-complication delivery in the U.S. is $12,290, HuffPost reported in November 2017. Uh, yeah. That's a pretty significance difference right there.

For the record, The Economist compared a different set of estimates — and the average U.S. delivery still came out higher than a royal delivery. In 2015, it cost $8,900 for 24 hours in a Lindo Wing deluxe room with a non-C-section delivery, according to the publication. A 2015 survey by the International Federation of Health Plans showed the average price for that type of delivery in the U.S. was $10,808. Oh, and did I mention that Middleton will get a 10-percent discount, according to Time, since they previously gave birth at the Lindo Wing? Isn't that lovely.
Keep in mind that we're only talking delivery costs, here. None of this is including postnatal care, meals, charges from multiple-night stays, additional procedures, etc. Truven Health Analytics found that U.S. hospital charged mothers who had employer-provided insurance an average of $32,093 for natural births and $51,125 for C-sections. Most of this cost, however, was covered by insurance.
For me, it's the principle of the matter that gets me. In what world is it acceptable for parents of a royal baby to be charged less for a delivery at a private, state-of-the-art facility with awesome accommodations — while the average U.S. parents are left paying more. (With crappy hospital food, to boot.) Answer: This world, apparently.
So the next time you find yourself daydreaming about what it would be like to live in a castle, be married to a prince, and have Kate Middleton's amazing hair/wardrobe, just remember: They also pay less than you for labor costs.

The Israeli military launched the attack on Palestinian positions after rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip, the IDF said.The missile attack, which the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) blamed on Hamas, happened Monday evening, according to an IDF spokesperson's statement. There's been no confirmation that any 'targets' have been hit, it added.Last week, the Israeli military and Hamas operatives exchanged fire which resulted in casualties. At least 25 people, including six children, were injured and two Hamas fighters killed in IDF strikes on alleged Hamas positions inside Gaza. Israel said it bombed the targets in response for rocket attacks launched at its territory.
There's a group of sons and daughters of former UCLA men's and women's standouts reaching the high school ranks.
The latest is Connor McGuire of Beckman, the team's starting second baseman as a sophomore.
Their father, Ryan, was a standout baseball player at El Camino Real and UCLA and played six years in the major leagues. Their mother, Kristy, was a swimmer at UCLA.
“Our sports were such a big part of our lives growing up,” Ryan said. “It's so fun to watch them be able to share the same experiences I had.”
Connor has an eighth-grade brother, Cade, who's a catcher, and a sixth-grade sister, Maggie, who swims.
Ryan grew up in Woodland Hills before moving to Orange County 10 years ago. Both of their sons are going to have to get a little stronger to hit a baseball as far as they used to do, but they said, “They're both farther along at their age than I was.”
Connor is known for their strong defense, athleticism and quickness. He's right-handed. The father is left-handed.
And the mother might be the best athlete in the family.
As it works to roll back the Affordable Care Act, the Trump administration is letting critical state health initiatives languish, frustrating a growing number of state leaders, including several from solidly Republican states.
Last week, Oklahoma's health secretary sent a blistering letter to senior administration officials, taking them to task for failing to approve a plan state officials drew up to protect their consumers from large rate hikes.
“The lack of timely waiver approval will prevent thousands of Oklahomans from realizing the benefits of significantly lower insurance premiums,” Terry Cline wrote to Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin and the then-secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price.
Health officials in other states say the federal health agency for months provided little help as they tried to plan for the expiration of federal funding for the popular Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. Money for the program, which covers nearly 9 million children, has begun to lapse because Congress failed to hit a deadline of Sept. 30 to renew the program, something lawmakers still hope to accomplish this year.
While the Sept. 30 deadline neared, the Trump administration was working to support Republican attempts in the Senate to roll back the current healthcare law, often called Obamacare.
“It was very hard to get answers to our questions,” said Cathy Caldwell, who oversees the CHIP program in Alabama and, like many state officials, is scrambling to figure out when they must begin cutting children from CHIP coverage.
The federal healthcare agency did not respond to a request for explanations of its actions or response to the criticism.
Meanwhile, across the country — in red states and blue alike — there are growing questions about how the administration is running complex government health programs that serve tens of millions of Americans.
“There's a problem here,” said Virginia Health and Human Resources Secretary William Hazel. “It may be deliberate sabotage at the very top. … But basic capacity seems to be an issue as well,” they said, noting vacancies and competing demands at the federal agency. Hazel, who currently serves a Democratic administration, was originally appointed by a Republican governor.
Minnesota's human services secretary, Emily Piper, who oversees that state's healthcare programs, said it has been hard to discern whether politics are driving all the problems, but the effect is the same.
“Basic services that we expect the federal government to provide are suffering,” they said.
Many healthcare programs that Americans rely on — such as CHIP, Medicaid and, in some cases, state insurance marketplaces created by the 2010 Affordable Care Act — are run by state governments, but funded and overseen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
That division of power has historically led to disputes between state and federal leaders.
The Trump administration has fueled additional tensions with its enthusiastic advocacy for Republican congressional efforts not only to repeal the current healthcare law but to dramatically cut other federal health programs as well. Senior staff at the Department of Health and Human Services have been working all year to support the repeal campaign.
At the same time, the administration has further aggravated many states with actions that are driving up insurance premiums and destabilizing markets, according to insurers, state regulators and consumer advocates.
For example, President Trump has repeatedly threatened to stop making federal payments to health insurers that offset the cost of covering out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income consumers.
Insurers across the country have cited uncertainty over these payments as a leading cause for big 2018 premium increases.
Over the summer, the administration also announced plans to dramatically scale back advertising and outreach efforts designed to get people signed up for insurance coverage in 2018, saying much of that work had proved ineffective in the past.
An aggressive enrollment campaign is widely considered key to getting younger, healthier Americans into the insurance market and controlling premiums.
In the face of the Trump administration's retreat, many states have intensified their own efforts to stabilize insurance markets and help consumers.
California, which operates its own insurance marketplace, has committed $100 million to a marketing and outreach campaign and developed a new system to shield some consumers from big rate hikes.
Peter Lee, who heads Covered California, said the Trump administration has generally not interfered in the state's marketplace.
But other states that have looked to the administration for assistance have been disappointed.
Oklahoma, for example, proposed a plan earlier this year to control insurance premiums for its residents, who were facing increases of 30% or more next year.
After months of discussions in which state officials said the Trump administration assured them approval would be coming, the administration took no action, letting a crucial deadline pass and assuring that health insurers would pass along major rate hikes to consumers next year.
“It was very frustrating,” said Julie Cox-Kain, Oklahoma's deputy health and human services secretary.
States looking for guidance over the summer about how to prepare for the expiration of federal funding for CHIP were similarly let down, according to multiple officials.
Several said they felt that their warnings about the need for action well before the Sept. 30 deadline were being ignored by federal officials.
“It's been a budgeting nightmare,” said Caldwell, the Alabama CHIP official. “And it is very stressful for families.”
Most states have enough money in reserve to continue CHIP coverage for weeks if not months, but all need several months of lead time to plan for freezing enrollment or cutting coverage should that become necessary.
In the past, administrations have helped states prepare for that possibility with written guidance about how to make preparations.
But for months, the Trump administration refused to provide states with anything in writing, Caldwell said.
More recently, as the CHIP deadline passed and state pleas intensified, federal officials began offering more assistance, several state officials said. Caldwell said they finally got critical information about how much federal funding was still available to Alabama.
The Court has detained Governor Ojaamong and three others facing fraud charges until Friday pending bail ruling. The four will be remanded at Ethics and Anti Corruption Commision Police Station.
Ojamoong' and three Busia County ministers have been charged with seven counts of fraud
The ministers are Mr Bernard Yaite, Mr Allan Ekweny and Mr Samuel Ombui.
The four were arraigned at the Anti-Corruption Court in Milimani, Nairobi, on Wednesday after being held in cells for more than four hours at the Integrity Center.
The court heard that they engaged a company known as Madam R Enterprise to conduct a feasibility study on waste management, yet it had not been budgeted for.
Mr Ojaamong' and the officials were accused of defrauding the county government of Sh8 million.
Other charges included wilful failure to comply with the law relating to management of public funds and fraudulent acquisition of public property.
They denied all the charges.
Senior assistant director of public prosecutions Alexander Muteti applied for warrants or arrest against six other accused persons.
Mr Ojaamong' is being accused of intentionally entering into an MOU with the firm even though they knew that the study had not been budgeted for in the year 2013/2014.
 They are said to have entered into the contract while in Berlin Germany on April 7, 2014.
The Busia Governor is also accused of abuse of office to improperly confer a benefit.
After weeks of pledging to put forth a fully costed election platform, the Ontario Progressive Conservatives have published a detailed list of their campaign promises, but without providing a full fiscal plan.
In “For The People: A Plan for Ontario,” the party pledges billions in tax cuts for families and businesses, along with other spending, including reducing the cost of gas by 10 cents per litre and a $5-billion investment in transit.
While the plan includes price tags for individual initiatives, it doesn't indicate what the total cost of the pledges would be, or present a multi-year fiscal outlook. Campaign officials wouldn't say if more information would be released.

When asked whether the information posted online on Wednesday was the party's official costed plan, a spokesperson for the PCs told Global News: “This is our plan for the people. That's the plan, throughout the campaign, this is what we've compiled.”
To pay for its plan, the party has said it would cut waste, audit government spending and save $270-million by cutting a business grants program, the Jobs and Prosperity Fund.
Ford has said a PC government would run deficits but return the books to balance before the end of its term.
A spokesperson said the party, if elected, was committed to “returning to balance as quickly as we can.”
“We do not know the state of Ontario's finances and anyone who tells you they do is lying to you,” they said.

In a statement on Wednesday, the Ontario NDP claimed the PCs were “hiding a costed platform.”
“Ford's un-costed excuse for a plan does not include a fiscal framework, or a timeline for balancing the provincial budget,” the statement read.
Liberal Leader Kathleen Wynne said the plan was not a costed platform and they claimed a PC government would have to cut projects and services.
“It's not coherent and I really think that they're not quite sure … how to talk about the fact that all of the things that Doug Ford has said would add up to a $40-billion hole.”

While the LG V30 is expected to launch in India on 13 December, rumours of LG's upcoming flagship have already started to surface. The latest report suggests that the LG G7 which is expected to launch within the first quarter of 2018, may feature an advanced iris scanner for better security.
Although not much is known about the feature, a report by GSMArena suggests that the Korea-based company is working on an iris scanner which will not only be handy in securely unlocking the smartphone but also protect sensitive information. The report brings forward an array of patented images which clearly reveal an iris-scanner based biometric system in the works.
Based on what can be deciphered from the labellings in the images, the iris scanner scans through characteristic features of the eye which involves a setup with a light and dark screen. The set up is such because the light and dark screens create a contrast in the amount of light hitting the iris. This forces the iris to dilate and contract accordingly. The sensor will then gather the data revealed and check whether the individual is the rightful owner of the phone.
The report also reveals that while regular iris scanners work with infrared light, LG's camera technology has been designed in a manner which allows the same camera to switch between regular and infrared mode. This results in fewer lenses and sensors on the front of the phone, allowing the bezels on the smartphone to be smaller.
The patented images do not reveal or suggest whether the feature will be available on the LG G7, but it likely that LG's technology could be ready in time for their first flagship of 2018.
(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Wednesday that it had approved Pfizer Inc's drug, Xeljanz, to treat adults with moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis.
The effectiveness of Xeljanz in treating ulcerative colitis was shown in three controlled clinical trials, including two trials that showed the drug caused disease remission in about 17-18 percent of the patients.
The drug is already approved by the FDA to treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis.
Xeljanz is expected to bring in sales of $2.16 billion in 2019, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It had generated sales of $1.35 billion in 2017.
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, inflammatory bowel disease that affects the colon and causes recurrent flares of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea.
More than 900,000 people suffer from the disease in the United States, according to the FDA.
Pfizer's shares were up 1.1 percent at $36.11 in afternoon trading.

Hey, everybody -- Damarious Randall didn't think you'd take their "you all get a jersey" Oprah moment seriously.
Speaking to reporters Wednesday, the Browns safety indicated they don't really intend to give everyone who retweets their now infamous "jerseys" tweet a jersey if the Cleveland Cavaliers win the NBA title.
If the Cleveland Cavaliers win the 2018 NBA finals Iâll buy everyone who retweetâs this a jersey... â Damarious Randall (@RandallTime) May 29, 2018
"I definitely didn't think the Cleveland fan base would go this crazy about it," Randall said, via ESPN's Pat McManamon. "Obviously, it is a joke. Just to know how passionate this fan base is, it is really encouraging."
While Randall would like to give jerseys to fans in the event of a Cavaliers victory, basic logic would tell you that they simply got caught up in the hoopla that comes with trying to fit in among an excited Cleveland sports fan base. Also, it would take some sort of Marshall Plan-like operation for them to deliver jerseys to whomever is behind the more than 818,000 retweets he's received (a bunch of those got to be bots, right?).
"Honestly, I didn't think it was going to get over 100 [retweets], to be honest," said Randall, who added that would do "something" for fans regardless of the NBA Finals result.
Randall is quickly learning the power of social media. They might want to think twice next time he's on Twitter -- or just listen to some sound advice from new Browns teammate Tyrod Taylor.
"Don't hit send," Taylor said.

Tensions on the Korean peninsula eased slightly on Monday as South Korea's president said resolving Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions must be done peacefully and key U.S. officials played down the risk of an imminent war with North Korea.
SEOUL/WASHINGTON: North Korea's leader has delayed a decision on firing missiles towards the U.S. territory of Guam while they watch the actions of the United States a little longer, the North's state media said on Tuesday, as Washington warned it would take out any missile heading for the Pacific island.
Pyongyang's detailed plans to land four missiles near Guam prompted a surge in tensions in the region last week, with U.S. President Donald Trump warning they would unleash "fire and fury" on North Korea if it threatened the United States.
In their first public appearance in about two weeks, Kim Jong-un inspected the command of the North's army on Monday, examining the plan for a long time and discussing it with army officers, the official KCNA said in a report.
"He said that if the Yankees persist in their extremely dangerous reckless actions on the Korean peninsula and in its vicinity, testing the self-restraint of the DPRK, the latter will make an important decision as it already declared," the report said.
The DPRK stands for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
"The United States, which was the first to bring numerous strategic nuclear equipment near us, should first make the right decision and show through actions if they wish to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula and prevent a dangerous military clash," Kim was cited as saying in the report by KCNA.

U.S. officials and South Korea's president in recent days have played down the risk of an imminent conflict while stressing their preparedness to respond militarily to any attack from North Korea.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Monday the U.S. military would intercept a missile fired by North Korea if it was headed to Guam.
Mattis told reporters that the U.S. military would know the trajectory of a missile within moments and would "take it out" if it looked like it would hit the U.S. Pacific territory.
"The bottom line is, we will defend the country from an attack; for us (U.S. military) that is war," Mattis said.

SOUTH KOREA SAYS NO MORE WAR
Concern that North Korea is close to achieving its goal of putting the mainland United States within range of a nuclear weapon has ratcheted up global concerns in recent months.
The European Union's top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, said the EU would intensify its diplomatic efforts with North Korea, the United States, South Korea, China, Russia and Japan.
Mogherini called on North Korea "to refrain from any further provocative action that can only increase regional and global tensions."
Tension on the Korean peninsula had eased slightly earlier on Monday as South Korea's president said resolving North Korea's nuclear ambitions must be done peacefully.
World stocks rose on Monday along with U.S. Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar as investors regained an appetite for riskier investments.
"There must be no more war on the Korean peninsula. Whatever ups and downs we face, the North Korean nuclear situation must be resolved peacefully," President Moon Jae-in told a meeting with senior aides and advisers.
"I am certain the United States will respond to the current situation calmly and responsibly in a stance that is equal to ours," they said.
Tuesday marks the anniversary of Japan's expulsion from the Korean peninsula, a rare holiday celebrated by both the North and the South. Moon and Kim are both expected to make addresses on their respective sides of the heavily militarised border.
The United States and South Korea remain technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.

ALTON | Alton Steel Inc. has produced the first bar-in-coil through its newly installed Garrett-style coiler. The $4.75 million project was approved in July 2017 by Alton Steel's Board of Directors.
The equipment addition complements ASI's existing offerings of hot-rolled, cut-to-length SBQ (special bar quality) bars and boosts support for customers in the cold-drawn steel bar industry, as well as other manufacturers who use coiled bar as raw material.
“We are excited about this new line and the benefits it brings to Alton Steel, its employees and the greater Alton community,” President and CEO Jim Hrusovsky said. “A considerable amount of effort has gone into the installation of this equipment; I'm proud and thankful for our employees, area contractors and our Board of Directors who have contributed time, energy, and dedication in seeing this project to completion. Through diligent project management and excellent teamwork, the project was completed on time and under budget. Most importantly, there were no recordable injuries during the seven months of construction.”
This addition will provide customers a wide size range of coiled bar, from 0.75 inches through 1.812 inches diameter, with coil weights of approximately 5,000 pounds. Alton Steel has already received orders for this new product line and is planning a ramp-up of production over the next several months.

A new watchdog report has praised West Yorkshire Police (WYP) for its ethics, accessible complaints system and the treatment of staff.
As part of its annual inspections into police effectiveness, efficiency and legitimacy (PEEL), HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) assesses all the forces across England and Wales.
Reports released today look into police legitimacy – how fairly and respectfully the forces treat those they serve, whether they behave ethically and lawfully and the way they treat their workforces.
WYP has been rated as “good” in all three areas by the watchdog.
HM Inspector of Constabulary Mike Cunningham said: “The force strives to make sure that its workforce behaves ethically and lawfully.
“Senior leaders regularly refer their decisions to both internal and external ethics committees that provide robust oversight and critical feedback.
“The force is doing positive work to make the complaints process accessible and easy for the public to use, and it generally provides timely and meaningful updates to complainants on the progress of their case.
“The force recognises the importance of staff wellbeing, and is continuing to develop a comprehensive approach to understanding staff wellbeing.
“A clear strategy for wellbeing is in place, supported by organisation-wide, district and departmental plans.”
For the areas of legitimacy inspectors looked at this year, its overall judgement is the same as in 2016 for WYP.
The number of stop and search procedures carried out by WYP in 2015/16 (excluding vehicle only searches) was 14,500, or 6.14 per 1,000 population compared to 4.8 in England and Wales.
The percentage of females in the workforce as of March 2017 was 42 per cent compared to 51 per cent in England and Wales.
And the number of grievances per 1,000 workforce raised and finalised in the 10 months up to March 31 this year were 3.3 with officers, 3.7 with PCSOs and 9.3 with staff.
West Yorkshire's Chief Constable Dee Collins said:“I am really pleased with the report, which reflects the positive approach West Yorkshire Police takes to ensuring everyone in the organisation realises the importance of treating their own colleagues and the public fairly and with respect.”
The area's Police and Crime Commissioner Mark Burns-Williamson added: “In really challenging times this is a very positive report and a great reflection on the work being done internally and externally to ensure our communities are safer and feel safer which is the overall vision set out in the Police and Crime Plan.”
The inspection also assessed the force's leadership.
Last month the force was also praised as “good” for how efficiently it keeps people safe and reduces crime.
It is yet to be graded this time on effectiveness.
All other police forces in Yorkshire were rated as “good” overall.

MULTAN-Former Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gillani has said that the scheduled PPP public meeting on March 10, in Multan would prove that the party is still the largest political party of the country.
Talking to a delegation of People's Unity led by Habib Ullah Shakir here on Tuesday, they claimed that the PPP would form government in Punjab and centre after the next election. They said that Bilawal Bhutto Zardari was the only person who could steer the country out of crisis. They said that the elimination of terrorists and terrorism begun during their regime as PPPP launched an organised campaign against the terrorists. They said that PPPP was the party of workers and it always accommodated its workers.
Habib Ullah Shakir, president of People's Unity Multan Asad Mahmood Bokhari and General Secretary Jahangir Khakwani said that People's Unity always strived to protect the rights of the workers. They criticised the government and said that PPPP created new jobs for people whenever it came into power but the current rulers did nothing except for rendering the people jobless.
SEOUL - North Korea is in the "final stages" of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile, leader Kim Jong-Un said Sunday, adding the country had significantly bolstered its nuclear deterrent in 2016.
"We are in the final stages of test-launching the intercontinental ballistic missile," Kim said in a 30-minute televised New Year's speech, pointing to a string of nuclear and missile tests last year. Pyongyang had "soared as a nuclear power", they said, adding it was now a "military power of the East that cannot be touched by even the strongest enemy".
The country carried out two nuclear tests and numerous missile launches last year along in pursuit of its oft-stated goal -- developing a weapons system capable of hitting the US mainland with a nuclear warhead.
"We have seen marvellous feats for bolstering our military power, including the fact that our preparations for test-launching an intercontinental ballistic missile are in the final stages," Kim added. Analysts are divided over how close Pyongyang is to realising its full nuclear ambitions, especially as it has never successfully test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).
But all agree it has made enormous strides in that direction since Kim took over as leader from their father Kim Jong-Il, who died in December 2011. A senior US defence official said last month that the North has developed the capability to pair a nuclear warhead with a missile and launch it, but has not mastered bringing the weapon back from space and onto a target.
There are growing concerns of fresh provocations by Pyongyang following last month's impeachment of South Korean President Park Geun-Hye, which has left the country with a caretaker leader -- Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-Ahn.
On relations with South Korea, Kim said the North was willing to "hold hands with anyone who wishes to improve North-South ties". But they denounced Seoul for pushing inter-Korean relations to their "worst state". "We must launch all-out efforts to pulverise actions by anti-unification forces like Park Geun-Hye," they said.
Kim called for an end to the South's annual joint military exercises with the United States -- a perennial thorn in North-South ties.
"Unless they stop the war of annual exercises, the DPRK (North Korea) will keep increasing military capabilities for self-defence and preemptive striking capacity with a main emphasis on nuclear force," Kim said.
Kim, wearing black-rimmed glasses and a dark Western suit and tie, delivered their speech from behind a lectern in a wood-panelled room in the ruling Workers' Party Central Committee Office Building in Pyongyang. No audience was shown although the address was regularly interrupted by what appeared to be canned applause.
Although Kim did not make a specific reference to the incoming Donald Trump administration, they called on Washington to make a "resolute decision to withdraw its anachronistic hostile North Korea policy".
Washington has repeatedly vowed that it would never accept the North as a nuclear state. Trump has never clearly stated their policy on the isolated state. "North Korea is indirectly pressuring the Trump administration with its possible ICBM launch," said Kim Yong-Hyun, professor of North Korea studies at Seoul-based Dongguk University.
"It is stressing that if the US upholds its policy of pressuring the North, it will conduct an ICBM test in the first half of this year," they said.
Thae Yong-Ho, North Korea's former deputy ambassador to Britain who defected to the South in August, has said Kim was planning a "prime time" nuclear weapons push in 2017 to take advantage of leadership transitions in Washington and Seoul.

ALBANY, Georgia — There is an additional parking space being occupied at the already busy Thrush Aircraft factory, as Robert Garrett has joined the company as director of training.
Garrett, a veteran of the ag aviation industry, will oversee Thrush's new factory-based ag aviation flight and maintenance training programs.
They hold a Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Science and has more than 8,000 hours of flying experience over some 19 years in the aerial application industry.
They have been tasked with setting a high bar for Thrush's new training initiatives and establishing an ongoing rapport with students and operators nationwide.
To keep their skills at their very highest level, when he's not teaching, Garrett will continue their flying by serving as an additional production test pilot at the factory.
Thrush is expected to host its first factory training class in first quarter of 2018, as simulator installation and final production of the courses' new dual cockpit 510G are underway.
In addition to the combined flight and the simulator program for pilots, the factory will continue its on-site maintenance program for mechanics as well. That program has also received a significant upgrade in recent months as the company continues to strengthen its belief that the safest pilots and mechanics are those that receive the very best training, company officials noted.
“Every one of us here at the factory understands the importance of not just building great airplanes, but of supporting those airplanes with a training program that is second to none,” said Payne Hughes, president. “Robert will play a key role in making this happen, and I'm darn proud to have them join our team.”
Founded in 2003, Thrush Aircraft manufactures a full range of aerial application aircraft used in agriculture, forestry and fire fighting roles worldwide. Today there are more than 2,100 Thrush aircraft operating in some 80 countries around the world.

WASHINGTON The gunshots that ripped through a congressional Republican team practice early Wednesday on a Virginia baseball field not only shook the U.S. Capitol but also upended what many Americans consider a symbol of fair play and summer fun.Before they were killed, a gunman shot and wounded a senior Republican House leader and several others getting ready on an Alexandria, Virginia, field for a charity game between Republicans and Democrats on Thursday in nearby Washington, D.C.The annual Congressional Baseball Game charity event, where Senate and House members from both parties face off together, has raised $600,000 for the Boys and Girls Club, the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation and the Washington Literacy Center, according to several lawmakers and event organizers.The game at Nationals Park may be one of the last vestiges of cooperation between the two sides in the nation's capital, where some believe partisan politics is at an all-time high. "There's such a hatefulness in what we see in American politics and policy discussions right now ... this has got to stop," Representative Rodney Davis, a Republican team member, told CNN in an interview while still wearing their baseball cleats and practice clothes.
Davis said the congressional game was a great demonstration that Democrats and Republicans could still get along.“We have fun," said a visibly upset Davis. "I never thought I'd play a baseball game for charity, got to practice at 6:30 in the morning and have to dodge bullets."
The gun violence early on Wednesday scarred what is for many almost sacred American ground - the baseball field. Considered America's so-called national pastime, the game dates back to the 1800s even as it now competes heavily with other popular sports including football and basketball."I've always felt safe on a baseball field, and now I don't know if I'll ever feel safe on a baseball field again," Representative Chuck Fleischmann, also at the shooting scene, told CNN. The grassy field once known for roasted peanuts and hot dogs now instead conjures images of a battlefield, fellow Republican Brad Wenstrup, an Army Reserve officer, said on Twitter.
"You never expect a baseball field in America to feel like being back in a combat zone in Iraq, but this morning it did," wrote Wenstrup, a member of congress from Ohio. When congressional members were told in a bipartisan briefing that Thursday's baseball game would still be held despite the shooting, they leapt to their feet in a standing ovation, Republican Representative Martha McSally told Reuters."Tomorrow we'll go out on the field, we'll root for our team," U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi later told lawmakers from the chamber floor. "We will use this occasion as one that brings us together and not one that separates us further."

It's common knowledge that using your phone while driving is dangerous. But people do it anyway – around twice as much as they're willing to admit, according to a new study.
The study by Zendrive, a research company working to improve road safety, looked at 570 million trips among 3.1 million drivers between December 2016 and February 2017 and found drivers used their phones a whooping 88 percent of the time.
They also found time on phones averaged three and a half minutes for every hour of driving. Looking away from the road for two seconds increases your chances of crashing 24 times over.
That number is much higher than previous studies that asked drivers to self-identify if they were texting while driving. About 40 percent of drivers admitted in a 2016 AAA Foundation survey that they read an email or text while driving in the past month, and about a third said they had written a text or email.
Meanwhile, 81 percent said texting while driving is a “very serious threat to safety” and 88 percent support a texting ban, according to the same survey. Nearly all states and U.S. territories have blanket laws banning either handheld phone use or texting while driving, with Montana, Missouri, Arizona and Texas the exceptions. All four of those states have proposed those laws but have not passed them, though Texas does ban the use of phones in school zones.
The state with the most distracted drivers was Vermont, according to Zendrive, and the least distracted drivers were in Oregon. It's unclear how much of an effect bans on phone use have on cutting down on distracted driving, based on Zendrive's findings.
In 2015, 3,477 people were killed due to distracted driving and nearly 400,000 were injured, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
SAHIBGANJ, India (Reuters) - An elephant blamed for killing more than a dozen people in Jharkhand and Bihar was shot dead on Friday, after an elaborate hunt that involved dozens of forest officials and a sharpshooter.
State forest official N. K. Singh said the team was assembled was after the elephant, believed to be 20-25 years old, had killed 11 people in the state since March and had damaged some houses.
Singh said the elephant was also believed to have killed four people in the neighbouring state of Bihar before that.
Sharpshooter Shafath Ali Khan said in an interview that they first came upon the animal on Thursday, and fired a tranquilizer dart into the elephant's neck but did not bring it down.
The animal escaped, but Khan later shot and killed the elephant with a .458 calibre magnum rifle.
Khan said it was the seventh elephant they had killed, adding that in the past they had also killed five tigers and eight leopards that had threatened people in other parts of the country.
Forest officials removed the elephant's tusks and planned to bury the animal in the forest with salt and some flowers.
GRANDE PRAIRIE, Alta. – Horses that were struggling after falling through thin ice in northwestern Alberta were saved by rescuers who cut paths to the shore with chainsaws.
Trevor Grant, the County of Grande Prairie's fire chief, says 10 horses fell through a frozen dugout on a rural property on Sunday.
Only their heads were visible above the open patches of water that surrounded them.
WATCH: Dramatic rescue of horse pulled from Okanagan creek
Firefighters in yellow suits and wearing safety tethers to connect them to the shore were armed with chainsaws and other equipment as they ventured onto the ice to try to help the animals.
Grant says one horse had already died of injuries and two more died from exhaustion, but seven made it to safety.
Grant says they spoke with a veterinarian who told them the seven survivors are doing well.
“It was pretty overwhelming having that sheer number of horses in need,” Grant said Monday. “Bystanders were pretty excited, but the crews were able to get control of the situation and develop a plan.”
Grant said the animals weren't as calm as regular horses because they were rodeo broncs. Still, they said, animals in need typically understand that people are there to help them.
WATCH: Horse submerged in central Alberta creek rescued in freezing temperatures
Some of the firefighters were specially trained for large animal rescue, Grant said. They know how to save horses and livestock that fall though ice, get stuck in mud or fall down slopes.
In total, 35 firefighters helped in the rescue, which lasted nearly two hours.
“They were able to cut pathways in the ice to get the horses out to the shoreline. And then they used some specialized rigging such as slings to assist the horses out and onto the shore.”
Some of the animals were able to walk out and others were lifted to safety with special rigging.
RCMP weren't able to say Monday whether they are investigating.
A legal victory against mandatory vaccination of children may spell trouble for generations to come. Professor Mehmet Ceyhan, who heads the National Vaccination Commission, says vaccine exemptions rose 13 times in the past three years, and more than 12,000 people were exempted from vaccination in 2016 - the latest year with available data - upon their request. "It is still growing, and if we don't stop it, once deadly diseases such as diphtheria, whooping cough, smallpox, measles will make a comeback," they said.
Vaccination has long been a controversial issue in Turkey, as several parents over the past few years have filed lawsuits against the Health Ministry, which oversees the vaccination of children. In 2015, in a landmark verdict, the Constitutional Court ruled that mandatory vaccination carried out by the Health Ministry against the consent of parents contradicted the constitutional rights of parents. The top court's ruling said that parents cannot be forced to have their children vaccinated, even if they are ordered by the courts, and an amendment is needed in the law concerning mandatory vaccination.
Parents cite "scientific" studies indicating the side effects of vaccines to back their legal claims, though a majority of the medical community point out that "studies" concerning the damage caused by vaccinations have been debunked.
"Vaccination should be made on a voluntary basis, not through forcing people to have it. We will launch a campaign in May to inform people on vaccination," Ceyhan says. "Vaccination objectors are more popular nowadays, but this is an issue that harms the overall public. We see the emergence of diseases whose prevalence was completely eliminated in the past, such as measles, because people reject taking a second dose to completely prevent infection. People are hospitalized for whooping cough in this age because they reject vaccination," they say. "Certainly, vaccinations do not provide 100 percent protection, but if more people tend to skip vaccines, there is the likelihood of having more people infected among those vaccinated.
The gunman who opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas did not have help from a second attacker, officials said Friday, but it remains unclear whether they made anyone else aware of their plans in advance.
Police investigators and more than 100 Federal Bureau of Investigation agents have combed through hundreds of leads and hours of video from the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino to determine why Stephen Paddock, 64, opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest Festival, leaving 58 people dead and nearly 500 others injured.
Unlike the investigations that follow many mass shootings, a study of Paddock's computers, political affiliations, behaviors and finances has not uncovered any clear motive for the attack or any “potential radicalization,” Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said.
“I get it — we all want answers,” McMahill said. “We have looked at everything, literally.”
They urged anyone with information about Paddock's movements or plans to call (800) CALL-FBI, saying there could be “a number of people out there that know that something looked out of place.”
Disputing a media report published Friday, McMahill also said investigators “do not believe” someone used a key card to enter Paddock's room during a period when their car was not in the Mandalay Bay garage.
A “voluminous amount of video” from the resort has not turned up anyone that police “believe to be a suspect,” McMahill said.
In the last year, Paddock — a retired real estate investor and former IRS agent — used their apparently extensive financial resources to fund their plans for the attack while also bankrolling their longtime passion for gambling.
Since last October, Paddock bought 33 guns, a haul that could have cost them tens of thousands of dollars. Investigators have wondered whether their weapons spending spree could have escaped notice.
Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley, has said through an attorney that they did not know what they were planning. They bought them a “cheap” plane ticket to the Philippines two weeks before the attack to visit their family, they said.
After paying for Danley's flight, Paddock apparently headed for Las Vegas, where they were seen from Sept. 14 to 28, according to records reviewed by representatives of the El Cortez Hotel and Casino.
They checked in to the Mandalay Bay hotel on Thursday, Sept. 28, and shuttled more than two dozen weapons to their two-room suite using more than 10 suitcases.
Although that behavior sounds unusual, it isn't out of place in a town like Las Vegas, where media companies and other exhibitors shuttle in vast amounts of supplies for conventions and conferences, said Rep. Dina Titus (D-Nevada), who represents the Las Vegas Strip.
“These hotels have thousands of rooms with people in and out all the time,” Titus said. “Ten suitcases sounds like a lot if you're staying at the Holiday Inn for the weekend. But convention and media companies bring boxes full of equipment.”
The attack will force the city to reassess security on the Strip and at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway and the Life is Beautiful music festival, which were previously considered “soft” targets not needing special protection, Titus said. All three should be considered hard targets, they said, though not necessarily with airport-style security.
McMahill again praised the role of hotel security guard Jesus Campos in finding Paddock's room and stopping the attack.
Some time after Paddock began firing on the crowd, a door to another room on the 32nd floor was left ajar, triggering an alarm inside the hotel, McMahill said.
When Campos arrived to investigate the alarm, Paddock fired more than 200 rounds at them through their hotel door, striking the guard in the leg.
Police believe the alarm going off was a coincidence, McMahill told CNN. But Campos helped police locate Suite 135 rapidly, potentially cutting the attack short.
"He's an absolute hero,” McMahill said.

The Corbin Tourism and Convention Commission got some good news during a special called meeting Tuesday afternoon.
Revenues for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, are $85,026 higher than what they were at this point last year.
“Wow! That is really good,” noted Corbin Tourism Director Maggy Kriebel. “That is a lot of meals and hotel stays over last year.”
LOS ANGELES: A 24-year-old YouTube singer with a teen fan base has been charged with using social media to solicit explicit videos from two young female fans.
Austin Jones was charged with two counts of production of child pornography, according to a complaint filed on Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Chicago, where they appeared.  They are being held in federal custody pending another hearing on Thursday.
Jones has racked up millions of views on YouTube, a unit of Alphabet Inc , with their covers of pop songs and has more than 200,000 followers across their Twitter, Instagram and YouTube channels.
Jones' attorney Gerardo Solon Gutierrez said by phone that the singer was "innocent until proven guilty."
Their arrest marked another scandal involving YouTube's social media personalities. In February, YouTube and Walt Disney Co cut ties with influential Swedish social media star PewDiePie, who boasted some 53 million YouTube followers, after they posted a series of videos deemed anti-Semitic.

According to the federal complaint, Jones used Facebook and Apple Inc's iMessage service to request sexually explicit videos from girls aged about 14 to 15.
The documents allege that Jones sent numerous messages to two 14-year-old female fans from 2016 and 2017 in which they instructed them to expose their genitals in videos sent to them through Facebook.
A review of their social media activities showed that "his primary fan base appears to be teenage girls," the court documents said, adding that Facebook shut down Jones' page a month ago due to their involvement with minors on the network.
Facebook Inc said in a statement on Wednesday: "We have zero tolerance for sharing or soliciting child exploitative images or videos on Facebook, and we cooperate with law enforcement agencies that investigate these crimes."
Representatives for YouTube and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Bhupendra Singh on Tuesday blamed pornographic websites for rising number of child rape and molestation cases in the country.The minister said their government is considering banning porn in Madhya Pradesh."We think the reason for rising number of child rape and molestation cases is porn. We are contemplating banning porn in Madhya Pradesh, will approach Centre in the matter," Singh said.According to reports, the state government in Madhya Pradesh has blocked 25 porn sites.Singh's statement comes after the horrific rape and murder of an infant baby girl in Indore on April 19.Just two days ago, an Indore model took to Twitter to narrate how their skirt was pulled at on a busy street in the city and no one came forward to help her.On Sunday, following the huge outrage over the gang-rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Kathua and rape of a teenager in Unnao, the Union Cabinet approved the promulgation of an ordinance to allow courts to award death penalty to those convicted of raping children up to 12 years of age.Many other states are also contemplating bringing in a similar legislation.
Creationist Ken Ham is steaming mad over a Washington Post article that claims their giant Noah's Ark attraction teaches tourists that dinosaurs died in the biblical flood. Hey @washingtonpost we at @ArkEncounter have NEVER said Dinosaurs were wiped out during Flood-get your facts right https://t.co/BLzQp1mKa0— Ken Ham (@aigkenham) January 1, 2017 Ham, who believes the Earth is about 6,000 years old, fired off several additional tweets directed at the Post over the story. Indeed, the Ark Encounter doesn't claim all dinos died out during the flood. Rather, it features dinosaurs living in cages like the other animals. Their organization has said most dinosaurs died in the flood, which it claims took place 4,300 years ago. “Those descended from the ones which got off the Ark eventually succumbed to the same sorts of pressures which cause extinction in animal populations today,” a 2011 blogpost said. Scientists agree almost universally that dinosaurs were wiped out 65 million years ago, although researchers continue to study the specific causes. The American Museum of Natural History in New York notes that a comet or asteroid strike along with “massive volcanic eruptions and changing sea levels” all may have played a role. (h/t Raw Story)

Microsoft has started blocking Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 updates for computers running certain new chipsets.
The company announced plans last January to block next-generation Intel, AMD and Qualcomm processors from system updates on older versions of Windows, but didn't reveal when support would be cut.
The process appears to have just kicked off.
Social media users are reporting that Microsoft is now blocking access to Windows 7 and 8.1 updates on devices running Intel's Kaby Lake processor.
Instead of the normal download screen, users attempting to update their systems are facing an error message reading, “Your PC uses a processor that is designed for the latest version of Windows.
“Because the processor is not supported together with the Windows version that you are currently using, your system will miss important security updates.”
Microsoft has tried to justify the move by saying that the processors offer new capabilities that make compatibility with older systems difficult, but it's also being seen as yet another aggressive technique designed to migrate more customers to Windows 10.
Changes to Microsoft's policy have also created plenty of confusion.
Skylake processors were included in the original policy announcement, but Microsoft has back-pedalled now says that some devices running the chipset will continue to receive Windows 7 and 8.1 updates, while others won't.
Machines running Ryzen, Kaby Lake and other new processors will have to upgrade to Windows 10.
Microsoft has released a Windows lifecycle fact sheet to clarify the situation.
Windows 10 Creators Update: What you need to do before downloading it
“Without Microsoft support, you will no longer receive security updates that can help protect your PC from harmful viruses, spyware, and other malicious software that can steal your personal information,” it reads.
In other words, users need to upgrade to Windows 10 or knowingly expose themselves to cybercriminals.
According to NetMarketShare, almost half of all computer users are still on Windows 7, which came out in 2009.
Earlier this month, Microsoft cut support for Window Vista, widely considered the worst version of the operating system ever made.

Islamabad: A top US state department official visited Pakistan to review the progress made by Islamabad on regional security and stability and met Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua and other senior officials, but the meeting ended without any breakthrough, according to a media report in Islamabad on Tuesday.
The US Department of State's Senior Bureau Official for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs ambassador Alice Wells visited Islamabad for meetings with Foreign Secretary (Tehmina) Janjua and other senior officials, a statement, issued late on Tuesday, by the US Embassy in Islamabad said.
"In their meetings, they discussed the status of the United States' South Asia strategy and efforts to make progress on regional security and stability," it added.
Wells was on a day-long trip to Islamabad to continue their talks in the wake of President Donald Trump's new South Asia and Afghanistan policy, in particular Pakistan's commitment in the war against terrorism.
In Washington, a State Department Spokesperson told PTI, "The purpose of Ambassador Wells' visit was to discuss the relationship between the United States and Pakistan, which is based on a broad range of shared interests, including a commitment to defeat all terrorist groups that threaten regional stability and security, and a desire to build economic and commercial ties that benefit both countries."
This is a follow on of Ambassador Wells' visit there in March as part of its ongoing dialogue on the bilateral relationship and Pakistani support for our South Asia strategy, the spokesperson said.
Pakistan's Foreign Office (FO) spokeperson, Mohammad Faisal only shared a picture of Janjua receiving Wells on the micro-blogging site 'twitter', but did not share any details of the meeting.
The two sides failed to make any headway, instead some new issues cropped up during the meeting which may further complicate the already strained US-Pak ties, the report said.
The another round of Pakistan-US talks aimed at getting Islamabad to fulfil Washington's expectations, envisioned in its South Asia and Afghanistan policy, ended without any breakthrough, Dawn reported.
Quoting a diplomatic source, it said that the agenda of both sides at the meeting at the FO were same as before, with the addition of two new issues — the restrictions on Pakistani diplomats that would come into effect from 1 May and a traffic accident involving US defence attaché Col Joseph Hall, who had earlier in April jumped a red light them and hit a motorcyclist, who later died.
Pakistan has demanded waiver of the diplomatic immunity to Hall, so that they could be prosecuted.
"There was no forward movement. But at the same time we must acknowledge that both sides continue to remain engaged in search of the elusive common ground," the source said.
The US' Afghan strategy has soured the ties between the two countries after they openly traded barbs over deteriorating situation in Afghanistan.
The US has been demanding Islamabad to use its influence to bring Taliban to negotiating table and the latter said that it has only limited control of rebels who now have areas in Afghanistan to live and operate without any foreign assistance.
This was ambassador Wells' second trip in less than a month after their last visit to Islamabad between 28 March and 3 April.
BUFFALO, N.Y (WIVB)– U.S. officials are trying to tamp down fears that nuclear war with North Korea is imminent.
Although, senior U.S. national security officials say the possibility of war with the reclusive nation is greater than it was a decade ago.
This follows a week of heated rhetoric between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Kyeonghi Baek, a professor of international relations at Buffalo State College, is following the developments with great interest.
“Obviously I worry because I hear all kinds of things on the news,” said Baek, who recently visited family in Seoul, South Korea.
While very much aware of the situation — they say people there don't dwell on the potential peril.
“People worry about the same things that we worry about,” Baek explained. “Educating our children well. Finding jobs for these young people. Making a good life for your family. That's what people really worry about.”
While there's now an effort to lower tensions, Baek worries about how the North Korean leader will react in the future given the heated rhetoric lately between both countries.
“If you push them too far they might be able to just really go out and just do an all-out war to stay in power. To them it's about survival,” Baek said.
“In spite of how they might appear, I think he's a rational political leader who wants to stay in power. I think that probably is their biggest concern,” they said.
During a recent visit to Asia, America's top general emphasized diplomacy and sanctions over war.
“In order for us to denuclearize North Korea, it's going to require China not only to do what they did at the United Nations Security Council, which was to vote for sanctions, but to enforce those sanctions,” said Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairperson of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff.
But having nuclear capability is a way for Kim Jong-un to “galvanize their people” and build national pride, according to Baek.
“To give that up, I don't see that happening anytime soon. And it really guarantees Kim Jong's power and their survival,” they added.
Baek hopes that stronger sanctions against North Korea will be an opportunity for another conversation with the nuclear-armed hermit nation.
“Not just Kim Jong-un, but their political supporters and political elite hopefully will realize that relaxed sanctions and a relaxed import and export relationship is better for North Korea.”
Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña announced that they will be filing complaints against Cebu City councilors Raymond Alvin Garcia, Jose Daluz III, and Renato Osmeña Jr. who decided to junk the joint venture agreement with the Gokongwei-led Universal Hotels and Resorts Inc. (UHRIA).
“They endorsed a resolution and voted against it. That's illegal,” said Osmeña.
In a separate interview, Garcia said they did not endorse the resolution authorizing Osmeña to enter into a JVA on developing Kawit Island in the South Road Properties (SRP).

Some very disgruntled DCEU fans are planning to sabotage Rotten Tomatoes' user ratings for Black Panther, much like they claim to have done on The Last Jedi. Rotten Tomatoes has addressed this plan of attack, and while they can't do anything about incoming reviews, they can ban users for hate speech. Now, Black Panther director Ryan Coogler has weighed in on the conversation, talking about their thoughts on Rotten Tomatoes as a whole.
The group of DCEU trolls is now reportedly angry about Marvel's decision to put out a movie that features a predominantly black cast and women in lead roles, though that wasn't mentioned in earlier reports. However, all the rogue team is doing is giving the real fans of the DCEU a bad reputation. They can affect the Rotten Tomatoes user score very easily, which was proven with Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi. The movie had incredibly high critical reviews and early viewing scores, but that all changed when a flood of negative user scores brought the audience score down, bringing controversy to both the movie and Rotten Tomatoes. The review site claimed that there was no tampering with The Last Jedi scores.
In a new interview, Ryan Coogler was asked if they were worried about the plan to have this group sabotage the reviews for Black Panther. As it turns out, the director doesn't care and just wants as many people to see the movie from all types of backgrounds. They explain.
"For me, I'm looking forward to everybody seeing the film. I'm really looking forward to sharing the film with audiences regardless of what their political views are... that's kind of where I (stand on that)."
Coogler isn't concerned and neither should anybody else be. Rotten Tomatoes isn't going to make or break a movie because of its user reviews. Ryan Coogler also talked about their feelings on Rotten Tomatoes in general. While the director welcomes criticism and dialogue, they believe that the site can sometimes "oversimplify" things. They had this to say.
"It... can be an oversimplification of what critics are saying about a movie. It's quicker to look at the consensus than it is to read the articles. But I'm a person who definitely respects film criticism and draws on it in the filmmaking process."
Most moviegoers don't sit and read through every review. Instead they look at the general consensus between critics and their peers. The Last Jedi was torn to shreds by users, but it ended up killing at the box office anyway. Black Panther is one of the most highly anticipated movies of 2018 and it's set to make a ton of money at the box office. Marvel is on a roll right now and some internet trolls aren't going to bring the studio or the movie down. Full reviews of Black Panther will go up on February 6th, so we'll be able to see what everybody thinks of the movie shortly. In the meantime, you can head over to The Huffington Post to read the rest of the interview with Ryan Coogler.
B.C. Liberal party members finish voting at 5 p.m. on Saturday, with the first results of their selections expected by 6 p.m. About 60,000 party members are eligible to vote on a ranked ballot with six candidates.
Here's what you need to know about each candidate:
• Mike de Jong has been an Abbotsford-area MLA since replacing Social Credit leader Grace McCarthy in a 1994 by-election. They served in most major cabinet roles, including five years as finance minister before the B.C. Liberal government's defeat last year.
De Jong's policy suggestions include expanding Mandarin language education in B.C. schools, moving the B.C. forest ministry headquarters from Victoria to Prince George, and offering parents full-day Kindergarten for four-year-olds.
• Michael Lee is a rookie MLA elected to represent Vancouver-Langara in 2017, and a former membership director for the B.C. Liberal Party. Their policy book includes a pledge to make B.C. “gasoline free” by 2050, increase electric car incentives and promote car sharing. They want to increase funding for school and community libraries and also increase independent and home-schooling options for parents.
• Todd Stone is the second-term MLA for Kamloops-South Thompson and former transportation minister. They have proposed dedicating B.C. tax revenues from the sale of legalized marijuana to deal with addiction and overdoses of hard drugs. In health care, they propose to build more government-funded primary care centres in B.C. communities and increase training spaces for nurse practitioners.
• Sam Sullivan is a former Vancouver mayor serving their second term as MLA for Vancouver-False Creek. Sullivan has shaken up debates with their suggestion that the B.C. Liberal Party should bring back the Harmonized Sales Tax in a modified form to make it more popular.  They are also proposing selling B.C. government liquor stores to their employees, similar to the way B.C. highway maintenance was privatized.
• Dianne Watts is the former Surrey mayor who resigned as Conservative MP for Surrey-White Rock to enter the B.C. Liberal leadership contest as the only candidate without a seat in the legislature. Them proposals include reinstating year-round seniors' discounts on B.C. Ferries, increase funding for community-based social and supportive housing and stop the provincial government from taking a dividend from B.C. Hydro and other Crown corporations.
• Andrew Wilkinson is a former party president in their second term as MLA for Vancouver-Quilchena. They have emphasized their opposition to the NDP-B.C. Green effort to convert to a proportional representation voting system, which they say will weaken rural B.C.
Wilkinson wants to abolish small business income on family businesses, increase mental health and addictions services and keep government stores out of marijuana retail sales.
A year ago today, Gambians went to the polls with hopes of voting out a dictatorship and ushering in a government that would restore democracy and a new era of hope. It was a long and difficult journey, characterised by 22 years of murders, arbitrary arrests and detentions, enforced disappearance, arson, bans on assembly, as well as blockages of internet and telecommunications services.
Prior to the election, then-candidate Adama Barrow promised the Gambian people that their human rights would be upheld. They also expressed a commitment to media freedom and freedom of expression. After their election, they reaffirmed this commitment during the first press conference they held as a President, and promised to re-open media houses that were closed down during Jammeh's regime and guarantee their editorial independence.
They also offered assurances that the government would operate an open-door policy towards the media, and that no journalist would be persecuted based on their or their journalistic work. Furthermore, they guaranteed that their government would reform repressive laws, and ensure that Gambians would be granted legal rights to access information.
Strong words. Hopeful words. It has been 10 months since the Barrow administration took over the helm of affairs. Is the government keeping its promises?
On the promise to open closed media houses, already the Daily News, an outlet previously shuttered in September 2012, has resumed publication and there are hopes that others will follow suit. On reform of the media landscape, the government, through the Ministries of Information and Justice, is working with stakeholders like the Gambia Press Union and international partners like Media Foundation for West Africa (MFWA - the organisation I work for), Article 19 West Africa and others on various projects aimed at promoting and protecting press freedom and freedom of expression. However, anti-media laws, such as the Libel and Sedition, False Publication and Information and Communications acts passed by the former administration remain on the books, even though their application has been suppressed.
With regards to government-media relations, the government, through its various ministries and agencies, now organises regular press conferences to brief the media on political developments and engage them in pertinent issues. For example, the director of press and public relations at the State House convenes press briefings every two weeks. The president themselves has committed to holding a bi-annual press conference and one-on-one interviews with the media. The first such press conference already took place on 27 July 2017.
Journalists aren't the only beneficiaries of this newly open environment. Gambians have also seized the relative freedom to express themselves. Now on the streets, in the markets, in vehicles, people freely talk about the government and national issues, and the senior officials' acts of commission or omission, without looking over their shoulders, and with the peace of mind that no one is eavesdropping to report them to the fearsome National Intelligence Agency (NIA). The erstwhile "house of terror" itself has been given a new mandate and rebranded as State Intelligence Services.
Journalists aren't the only beneficiaries of this newly open environment. Gambians have also seized the relative freedom to express themselves. Now on the streets, in the markets, in vehicles, people freely talk about the government and national issues, and the senior officials' acts of commission or omission, without looking over their shoulders..
During the 10 months this administration has been in power there have been very few violations of freedom of expression. There have been three known incidents. In two separate cases, supporters of one of the governing coalition's political parties assaulted a journalist during a rally. In the other incident, a Senegalese soldier part of the ECOMIG force manhandled a journalist during a session of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights. In these cases the Minister of Interior and Minister of Information, respectively, rendered an apology to the journalists. In the third case, a woman who was arrested for insulting the president was later released, and the charges dropped, when it became apparent that the president was not interested in the case. These scenarios would have played out much differently under the Jammeh administration.
The government has said it is putting in place measures to ensure that excessive legal restrictions on freedom of expression are removed. Recently, the Ministry of Justice, in a historic move, conceded that the sections of the Criminal Code on sedition and criminal defamation, and false publication on the internet under the Information and Communications Act are redundant. These constitutional provisions were being challenged by the GPU at the Supreme Court of The Gambia. The Ministry is, however, contesting challenges to section 181(A) of the Criminal Code for Publication of False News. This is a great concern to many persons, especially journalists who have been tried under this law and remain vulnerable should it not be repealed as part of the broader legal reforms.
So far, there seems to be no gender-specific discrimination on the government's agenda. There are no reported incidents of state-perpetrated online abuse or attacks on the basis of gender or sexuality. This government may have a softer stance on sexual diversity. President Barrow was recently asked about their position on homosexuality and they indicated that it was "not an issue in The Gambia." While many believe their response meant that it was not a common practice in the country, and as such, was brushing off the question, others welcomed it as a more measured response. This stands in stark contrast to the Jammeh administration's comments that suggested that members of the LGBTQI+ community should be punished by death.
Another welcome development is the tremendous change in how government relates to civil society. Collaboration and partnership with NGOs, virtually non-existent in the past administration, is now close and cordial. The level of working relations between the GPU, for example, is commendable. In addition to the joint committee on media reforms co-chaired by the GPU and the Ministry of Information, the press union has been invited to be part of the Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission. There are also indications it will be invited to be part of the proposed Constitutional Review Commission. The government has invited officials from other civil society organisations to participate on various committees looking at aspects of the transition and reforms. Notably, this includes civil society groups that are critical of the government.
Civil society organisations now operate more freely, share their opinions, and contribute to debates on governance issues, calling the government to order when necessary. This was not so in the past, when even international civil society organisations could not implement projects in The Gambia. In some instances, civil society organisations were ordered by government to halt specific initiatives aimed at promoting freedom of expression and other human rights. Today, the MFWA has a staff on secondment in The Gambia working with the GPU and the Ministry of Information on media reforms. Such is the environment. Government officials are now easily accessible, and participate in events they are invited to by civil society organisations.
Impunity and accountability
On the issue of impunity, the Barrow administration has shown a lot of commitment to holding perpetrators accountable for abuses under the former regime. During the early stages of the government's tenure, several former NIA officials were arrested for their roles in past human rights abuses. The cases are in court while the state continues to build evidence to effectively prosecute them. While the government has not yet held anyone accountable in the cases of Deyda Hydara, Musa Saidykhan and Ebrima Manneh and others, it has demonstrated strong will to compensate the victims/families. In fact, at a recent forum to mark the International day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists, representatives of the Ministries of Justice and of Information made an explicit commitment to comply with the ECOWAS Court's judgements to compensate these three journalists. The government has gone on to meet these victims to discuss the modalities of payment.
Looking ahead to 2018
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Newly launched bitcoin futures on Monday suggested that traders expect the cryptocurrency's blistering price gains to slow in the coming months, even as it blasted above $17,000 to a fresh record high in the spot market. Chicago-based derivatives exchange Cboe Global Markets (CBOE.O) launched the futures late on Sunday, marking the first time investors could get exposure to the bitcoin market via a large, regulated exchange. The one-month bitcoin contract <0#XBT:> opened at 6 p.m. local time (2300 GMT) on Sunday at $15,460. By late afternoon on Monday in New York, it was trading at $18,650, roughly 8 percent above bitcoin's spot price of $16,900 on the Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP. Bitcoin earlier hit a record high of $17,270. Its steep gains and rapid rise have attracted investors around the world as well as intense scrutiny from government regulators, which is the very opposite of what its creators wanted when it first launched bitcoin more than eight years ago. “The bitcoin founder should be horrified seeing it rise so quickly, as any serious focus on it and its recent explosive move higher will soon end its freedom,” said John Taylor Jr, president and founder of research firm Taylor Global Vision in New York. Taylor believes that based on their charts, bitcoin has not yet peaked, but as soon as the “upmove ends, it will crash.” Given bitcoin has almost tripled in value over the past month, and was up more than 15 percent on Monday alone, the futures pricing suggested investors see price increases moderating. Bitcoin futures were already offered on some unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges outside the United States, but backers said the U.S. market debut would confer greater legitimacy on the volatile cryptocurrency and encourage its wider use. The CME Group (CME.O) is expected to launch its futures contract on Dec. 17. (To view a graphic on Bitcoin's blistering ascent, click tmsnrt.rs/2AeMjHe) VOLATILITY CONCERNS Although there are hopes that the futures will draw in new investors, most fund managers at larger asset managers and institutional investors said bitcoin remains too volatile and lacks the fundamentals that give other assets value. “There's no place for bitcoin in a multi-asset portfolio given the very high volatility,” said Robeco Chief Investment Officer Lukas Daalder. The two-month contract was trading at $18,750, an 11 percent premium over the spot price, while the three-month contract was changing hands at $18,140, a roughly 12 percent premium. While modest when compared with bitcoin's 270 percent increase over the past three months and 230 percent rise in the last two months, those levels still indicated a lack of large “short” positions betting against bitcoin. “Anyone, especially a professional trading outfit, would be crazy to actually short sell this bull market,” said Nick Spanos, founder of Bitcoin Center NYC. “But just because it doesn't happen on day one doesn't mean it won't in the future.” Bitcoin was up more than 1,600 percent so far in 2017, having started the year at less than $1,000.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration‘MARCH TOWARDS LEGITIMIZATION' As of early afternoon trading in New York, 3,951 one-month contracts had changed hands, meaning around $73.1 million had been notionally traded. That compares with daily trading volumes of more than $21.5 billion across all cryptocurrencies, according to trade website Coinmarketcap. There had been speculation that the futures launch would trigger more gyrations in the market. But while volatile compared with traditional currencies or assets, the rise on Monday was relatively tame for bitcoin. Bitcoin surged more than 40 percent in 48 hours last week, before tumbling 20 percent in the following 10 hours. “(Bitcoin futures) will speed up the march towards legitimization of an asset class that only a few years ago many law enforcement agencies would have argued had limited legitimate reasons for people to use,” said Jo Torode, a financial crime lawyer at Ropes & Gray in London. The futures are cash-settled contracts, allowing investors exposure without having to hold any of the cryptocurrency. Slideshow (4 Images)The futures are based on the auction price of bitcoin in U.S. dollars on the Gemini Exchange, which is owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs and brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. (GRAPHIC: Bitcoin futures suggest growth, but slower - reut.rs/2yfblkV) DRAMATIC GAINS Bitcoin was set up in 2008 by an individual or group calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, and was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden, making traditional financial regulation difficult if not impossible. Central bankers and critics of the cryptocurrency have been ringing the alarm bells over its surge in price and other risks such as whether the opaque market can be used for money laundering. “It looks remarkably like a bubble forming to me,” the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's Acting Governor Grant Spencer said on Sunday. Somebody who invested $1,000 in bitcoin at the start of 2013 would now be sitting on around $1.2 million. Heightened excitement ahead of the launch of the Cboe futures gave an extra kick to the cryptocurrency's scorching run this year. The launch has so far received a mixed reception from big U.S. banks and brokerages. Several online brokerages, including Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N) and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp (AMTD.O), did not allow trading of the new futures immediately. The Financial Times reported on Friday that JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) would not immediately clear bitcoin trades for clients. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said on Thursday it was planning to clear such trades for certain clients. (For an interactive graphic on bitcoin's blistering ascent, click here)

Please everyone, keep buying the games you've already played on each new console that's released. I'm banking on playing the Dreamcast-era Crazy Taxi via chip implants in my brain while on my space transport to the Titan colony in 2050. It'll happen as long as you dish out money for played-out games!
It's going to a good cause... Why would you try to dissuade people from buying it? I plan on just giving my codes away to someone that doesn't have these games. 2 great causes with very little investment! St. Jude's and Make-A-Wish ALONE make me think of my daughters and how appreciative I'd be for people to give anything if they were sick...
Back in February, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s had an issue where they would sometimes shut down unexpectedly. In response, Apple announced the following:
"We also added the ability for the phone to restart without needing to connect to power, if a user still encounters an unexpected shutdown. It is important to note that these unexpected shutdowns are not a safety issue, but we understand it can be an inconvenience and wanted to fix the issue as quickly as possible. If a customer has any issues with their device they can contact AppleCare."
"With iOS 10.2.1, Apple made improvements to reduce occurrences of unexpected shutdowns that a small number of users were experiencing with their iPhone," Apple told iMore. "iOS 10.2.1 already has over 50% of active iOS devices upgraded and the diagnostic data we've received from upgraders shows that for this small percentage of users experiencing the issue, we're seeing a more than 80% reduction in iPhone 6s and over 70% reduction on iPhone 6 of devices unexpectedly shutting down.
My iPhone 6S has been very slow these past few weeks, and even after updating multiple times, it was still slow. Couldn't figure out why, but just thought that iOS 11 was still awful to me. Then I used my brother's iPhone 6 Plus and theirs was... faster than mine? This is when I knew something was wrong. So, I did some research, and decided to replace my battery. Wear level was somewhere around 20% on my old battery. I did a Geekbench score, and found I was getting 1466 Single and 2512 Multi. This did not change wether I had low power mode on or off. After changing my battery, I did another test to check if it was just a placebo. Nope. 2526 Single and 4456 Multi. From what I can tell, Apple slows down phones when their battery gets too low, so you can still have a full days charge.
It's been about 10 months since that update but that makes it three years since iPhone 6 and two years since iPhone 6s shipped. And two to three years can be a long time for batteries.
Once upon a time you loaded a web page or downloaded an email then spent a few minutes reading, turned off your iPhone, and went back to your day. Now we have social and gaming apps that keep the screen on while checking GPS, downloading media, showing the camera live view, and layering on augmented reality near-constantly.
The industry in general, from desktops to phones, has been prioritizing power efficiency over performance for years already. Processors could always run at redline but they'd burn the battery out just as fast. So, balancing power and performance is key.
Apple has been addressing this in multiple ways, from systems-on-a-chip with both high-efficiency and high-performance cores, to machine learning-based power management. But lithium-ion batteries are lithium-ion batteries.
With older phones and those with poorer battery health, one of the ways seems to be prioritizing battery life over processor speed. That'll cause a hit to performance but still allows the iPhone to make it through the day.
If and when you replace the battery, though, you essentially wipe away all those years and charge cycles and make everything old new again: iOS no longer has to worry about making it through the day so it can run the SoC at full speed.
If your battery health is especially bad, replacing the battery — which costs $79 at an Apple Store — can be such an improvement an argument could be made that Apple should pop up an alert advising people to do it. (My Mac has done this in the past.) The new alert section in Settings in iOS 11 would be great, low-interruption place to do it. Ditto the Battery Settings screen.
Or, to repeat what Apple said back in February:

Smallville actor Allison Mack was released from jail on a $5 million (£3.6 million) bail bond today to await trial on charges of recruiting women to serve as sex slaves into what was billed as a female mentorship group run by self-help guru Keith Raniere.
Allison, best known for their role as Chloe Sullivan in the hit TV series, was in court on Tuesday where the presiding judge approved their release from custody after their parents agreed to put the family's home in California up as collateral, and the 35-year-old agreed to live with their parents under house arrest.
As they left court, they were filmed battling their way through a media scrum with their representatives.

Last week, prosecutors in New York charged Allison with sex trafficking and conspiracy for recruiting women into a programme within Raniere's organization Nxivm, representing it as a female mentorship group.
They said that the actor, who has pleaded not guilty, played a major role in the group.
Prosecutors and Allison's lawyers said in a court filing that the two sides are engaged in plea negotiations.
Raniere, 57, was arrested on sex trafficking charges last month, and is being held without bail.
US Magistrate Judge Viktor Pohorelsky set terms that prohibit Allison from having any contact with Raniere, Nxivm or anyone associated with the organisation.
Authorities have accused Raniere of running a secret society within Nxivm where women were branded with their initials, put on extremely restrictive diets and forced to have sex with him.

Upon joining, members, who numbered as many as 50, were required to provide information about family and friends, nude photographs and rights to their assets, which were used to blackmail them into staying, according to prosecutors.
The women were taught that the society would empower and strengthen them, prosecutors said.
Nxivm on its website calls itself "a community guided by humanitarian principles that seek to empower people and answer important questions about what it means to be human."

Raniere said they were "deeply saddened" and denied "abusing, coercing or harming" anyone in a letter posted on the site.
Marc Agnifilo, a lawyer for Raniere, said earlier this month that they were "confident these allegations will be soundly disproven."
Every year, BOOM! Studio sets out on the road to San Diego with a ten-day series of announcements – anything from hot new releases to one of their titles being optioned for TV or movies.
This year, BOOM! Studio begins its ten day journey by introducing Joss Whedon's Firefly Comics – new monthly series, limited series, original graphic novels and more; created in partnership with 20th Century Fox Consumer Products.
First up, in November, a series that takes us back to the Unification War – and the story of Mal and Zoe met.
Comic Con International 2018 will take place July 19th–22nd at the San Diego Convention Center, in San Diego, CA.
BOOM! Studio Introduces Joss Whedon's FIREFLY Comics
The Road To San Diego Announcement #1: BOOM! Studio Takes The Crew of The Serenity Back to The War of Unification in November 2018
LOS ANGELES, CA (July 2, 2018) – BOOM! Studios are proud to kick off The Road to San Diego, a ten-day spotlight on the most exciting comic book and graphic novel news in advance of Comic Con International in San Diego (July 18-22), with the announcement it has acquired the comic book and graphic novel publishing license to Joss Whedon's FIREFLY, the iconic worldwide pop culture phenomenon. BOOM! Studios will release new monthly comic book series, limited series, original graphic novels and more that officially expand the rich mythology created in television, film and beyond in partnership with 20th Century Fox Consumer Products.
Created by visionary writer and director Joss Whedon (Buffy The Vampire Slayer) and set 500 years in the future in the wake of a universal civil war, FIREFLY centers on the crew of Serenity, a small transport spaceship that doesn't have a planet to call home. Captain Malcolm “Mal” Reynolds, a defeated soldier who opposed the unification of the planets by the totalitarian governed Alliance, will undertake any job — legal or not — to stay afloat and keep their crew fed. Thrust together by necessity but staying together out of loyalty, these disparate men and women are seeking adventure and the good life, but face constant challenges on the new frontier, such as avoiding capture by the Alliance, and evading the dangers you find on the fringes of the universe.
Beginning in November with the release of FIREFLY #1, from New York Times best-selling writer Greg Pak (World War Hulk, Mech Cadet Yu), artist Dan McDaid (Judge Dredd), and story consultant Joss Whedon himself, BOOM! Studios will take you back to the battleground where it all began…and reveal a secret history that might end it all. Fans have demanded it for years and now the definitive story of the Unification War—the intergalactic civil war that divided friend and family alike—is told at last!
“It's high time we got to see the full story of Mal and Zoe's meeting and mission in the War of Unification—the good and bad that the pressure of war brings out in them, and the unforeseeable consequences,” said Joss Whedon. “Greg Pak and Dan McDaid are bringing a unique voice to the world of Firefly. It's an important story for any dedicated browncoat to read, but more importantly, it's a big gorram adventure.”
“Firefly is such a special show, formative for so many of us today in the kinds of stories it told and the kinds of characters it created and we're so lucky to be able to continue Mal and Zoe and the rest of the crew's story here,” said Jeanine Schaefer, Executive Editor, BOOM! Studios. “Exploring the Unification War allows us to show you a side of the Firefly universe you've never seen before, while still wrestling with the same themes that make the show as resonant today as it was when it first aired: loyalty, identity, and the price of redemption.”
Mal thought they could outrun their past, but when a simple heist goes wrong, he's forced to confront it in the form of the Unificators, mercenaries deputized to hunt down war criminals…and they've got Mal and Zoe at the top of their list! War can make villains of even the best men, and Mal's quest for redemption will put them at odds with their own crew, forcing them to make a choice: fix the past or fight for the future.
“I was a sci-fi nerd who grew up in Texas, so Firefly's space western vibe had me from howdy. I also just love the show's combination of humor and action with honest emotional storytelling,” said Greg Pak. “That's a real sweet spot for me as a fan and a creator, and I'm thrilled to be able to join in on the fun. These characters are a dream to work with—they're all so well defined and interestingly matched with such great relationships and rivalries that putting any two of 'em together almost immediately results in a great scene. And the fact that the worldbuilding and big themes of the series are so compelling but still leave miles of room to explore means that the door's wide open for fantastic new stories. I'm honored and thrilled to join the crew and can't wait 'til you see what we have planned.”
“Firefly the show kind of passed me by the first time, but I adored the feature film Serenity (it was a first date movie for me and my partner!) and I've since gone back and devoured that one brief, beautiful season,” said Dan McDaid. “It's amazing to be able to bring you even more from that world and to work with Greg Pak, the guy who wrote the best run of Hulk comics in the modern age! That's so huge for me and it's still sinking in. I honestly can't wait for you to see what we've got lined up; this comic book is going to be—in the truest sense—epic.”
FIREFLY #1 is available exclusively in comic shops (use comicshoplocator.com to find the nearest one) on November 14, 2018 with a main cover by superstar Lee Garbett (Skyward), along with variant covers by Jock (Batman), J.G. Jones (Final Crisis), Bill Sienkiewicz (Daredevil), Joe Quinones (America) and more.
Arriving in stores the same day, FIREFLY: LEGACY EDITION BOOK ONE collects previously released Serenity comics for the first time under one cover in a new value-priced format as Mal & the crew ride again in these official sequels to the critically acclaimed Firefly television series and Serenity film.
FIREFLY is the latest release from BOOM! Studios' eponymous imprint, home to a world-class group of licensed comic book series and ambitious original series, including Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Planet of the Apes, Abbott, Victor LaValle's Destroyer, Mech Cadet Yu, Grass Kings, and Klaus.

(AP) Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman made a tiebreaking three-point play with 3.8 seconds left and finished with 17 points as No. 24 Michigan held on to beat Minnesota 76-73 in overtime on Saturday.
The Wolverines (19-6, 8-4 Big Ten) needed the extra time to win because they struggled to shoot from the field and the line. And they failed to slow down a pair of guards.
The Golden Gophers (14-11, 3-9) were in a position to end their longest losing streak of the year because first-year student Isaiah Washington had a season-high 26 points and Nate Mason scored 22 points, including a 3-pointer with 5.3 seconds left that tied the game.
Mason was just short on a shot from about 30 feet that would have forced a second overtime.
Michigan's Zavier Simpson made a layup and a 3-pointer – after missing their first seven attempts beyond the arc – to give their offensively challenged team a four-point lead with 2:50 left in the extra period.
The Gophers tied the game with 11 seconds left, but couldn't keep Abdur-Rahkman from making what the game-winning play on a hard-charging drive for a layup on which they were fouled by Jamir Harris.
Moe Wagner had 16 points and 10 rebounds, Simpson scored 15 and Charles Matthews had 13 points for the Wolverines, who have won four straight at home. Michigan made just 44 percent of its shots from the field and was 8 of 32 from the 3-point line.
Minnesota's Jordan Murphy fouled out in overtime with 12 points and six rebounds.
BIG PICTURE
Minnesota: The short-handed Gophers, who played just seven players, extended their season-long losing streak to five games. Minnesota was without Reggie Lynch because of an investigation into sexual assault allegations along with Amir Coffey (right shoulder) and Gaston Diedhiou (ankle) due to injuries.
Michigan: The Wolverines will lose some games they should win if they don't shoot better at the free throw line. They were 12 of 28 at the line, an area that has been a season-long weakness.
UP NEXT
Minnesota: Hosts Nebraska on Tuesday night.
Michigan: Plays at Northwestern on Tuesday night.
There are sound reasons to shun bitcoin. One is that it's horribly unstable in value and it's…

Who do you listen to when you're making investment decisions? Warren Buffett is high on many people's lists of gurus, and Neil Woodford has an impressive long-term record. But do you know who else I like to listen to? The proverbial man down the pub.

Who do you listen to when you're making investment decisions? Warren Buffett is high on many people's lists of gurus, and Neil Woodford has an impressive long-term record. But do you know who else I like to listen to? The proverbial man down the pub.
By that I mean anyone who has no real knowledge of investing, but who picks up on the latest fad and asks me about it. And twice in recent weeks, I've been asked about this bitcoin lark.
There are sound reasons to shun bitcoin. One is that it's horribly unstable in value and it's more akin to gambling than rational investing. Another is that it really doesn't possess the characteristics needed to actually work properly as a currency (essentially due to that instability), while yet another is that it also doesn't have what it takes to work as a gold substitute.
But putting those rational fears aside, the ultimate reason to see bitcoin as the latest South Sea bubble or tulip mania is possibly when the man down the pub starts talking about buying some.
Fads like bitcoin are often likened to the greater fool theory, in that when you invest in something at an inflated price, its only value lies in there being a greater fool to whom you can sell it on for even more. And when it's got to the man down the pub, you're reaching the end of the greater fools line.
It happened in the dotcom boom, it happened at the buy-to-let peak, and I see it happening to bitcoin.
I am surprised by the number of people who are quite happy to consider plonking a couple of hundred down on a dodgy get-rich-quick idea, but who throw their hands up in horror at the stock market and the risk they think they see of losing their shirts.
Growth stocks
Even FTSE 100 growth candidates, like Mediclinic International (LSE: MDC), are surely going to be a lot safer.
I reckon Mediclinic's erratic earnings performance of the past few years has possibly scared away a number of growth investors. After a couple of years of falling EPS following an early spike, the owner of Switzerland's largest private hospital group recorded a flat year in 2017.
Economic weakness in its home base of South Africa, coupled with Swiss regulatory issues, lie behind those few tough years, but the company has branched out into the Middle East with the acquisition of the Al Noor Hospital group.
For the year to 31 March, Mediclinic recorded an operating loss of £288m, though that was littered with one-offs and the firm claimed an adjusted operating profit of £370m (up 3%).
While financials are tricky to make sense of in this transitional period, investors' hopes will surely be focused in an easterly direction. Outgoing chief executive Danie Meintjes reported a “strong second half performance in Abu Dhabi,” and reckoned that, with “continued strong delivery in Dubai and the exciting expansion opportunities ahead,” there should be further growth in the Middle East in the years to come.
Analysts seem to think so too, with a modest EPS rise of 5% predicted for this year and a beefier 12% pencilled in for 2019.
That suggests a 2019 P/E of 17.7, which I don't think is too demanding. Certainly better value than bitcoin, in my view.
AFTER THE POSTPONED SWEARING IN, THE NEXT STEPS
Yesterday's Supreme Court's judgement fell like a thud. The Court's election verdict in August electrified all Africa, but given all the horrors that have since rolled back what that that judgement promised, Kenyans no longer have any hope that the Supreme Court or any other current institution can play a significant role in tamping down our fraught crisis.
Instead of the Court judgement, what continued to dominate most Kenyans' passions yesterday was the previous day's news that Mr Raila Odinga would not be sworn in.
Vast numbers of NASA supporters are determined to resist and confront the dictatorship which now prevails and has robbed them of their most fundamental rights, like electing the leaders they want and being able to protest peacefully without being slaughtered.
The expected swearing-in had therefore become for the people a powerful symbol of resistance to the injustices and deprivations they are no longer willing to abide. They have lost all hope in the system.
I am certain that President Uhuru Kenyatta is not fully aware of this militant resolve among tens of thousands of Kenyans. If they were, they would surely take some steps to defuse this intense and growing crisis.
Instead, their regime mystifyingly continues to intimidate and antagonize Nasarites. Last week, Uhuru's close confidante Gatundu MP Moses Kuria told a rally that if Raila swore themselves in, they would be convicted of treason, then hanged by their neck, until a doctor came and certified that they were dead. That kind of inhuman talk about a leader is obviously designed to enrage millions of Raila's passionate supporters. To what end? Deepen the crisis?
As we have seen, there are already masses of Kenyans prepared to risk death to exercise their right to resist. Others are wanting to arm and protect themselves from wanton brutality and to take an eye for an eye. Every day, talk of secession grows. There has never been anything like it in our post-independence history.
THE TINDER BOX
Kenya is a tinder box. This is not just mine or NASA's view. The Financial Times, one of the world's most influential and sober newspapers, wrote in an editorial last month that “there is an ever-present danger that state-sponsored violence will provoke a retaliation that could spiral out of control.” The editorial was headlined “Kenya dances near the brink of dissolution.”
That is why I wrote six days ago that “Mr Raila Odinga is holding the country together through their commitment to pursuing constitutional and peaceful means” for resisting unlawful rule.
Those who might have scoffed at that assertion might be reassessing it after seeing how intensely NASA supporters wanted Raila to be sworn in, and the massive, visceral response that erupted to the swearing-in having been scrubbed. Some now want the National Resistance Movement to now be hived off from NASA.
The key responsibility for tamping down this diabolical situation is Uhuru Kenyatta, not only because their actions are what has brought Kenya to this pass but because they are the sworn-in President of Kenya. They should be concerned about ALL Kenyans' grievances, even if they believe they are wrong. In any event, if Kenya burns, it will be under their watch, and they will ultimately be responsible.
The Western envoys, who have been intimately involved in the unfolding political dance from the very outset, and whose countries would suffer from any Kenyan meltdown, need to play a more balanced role than they have. At crucial moments they have missed taking advantage of opportunities for showing their impartiality.
With the swearing-in now postponed – which they had wrongly opposed publicly, like their opposition to non-participation in the October 26 election – they should not lose the opportunity to strenuously push for a meaningful dialogue that they consider is a priority to calm the country.
As I stated here a few days ago, Raila themselves has consistently stated in recent weeks the need for a serious dialogue of equals that addresses the root causes of the crisis, including electoral injustice. Uhuru brushed off that proposal yesterday. Will the envoys now publicly urge Uhuru to engage, as they did Raila?
NASA supporters – like Jubilee's – have a key role to play. They are clearly the victims of many outrages, so one must recognize that fact before seeking concessions from them. Certainly, their right to assemble and demonstrate cannot be questioned, indeed without the pressure that those rights confer, there is little hope that the government or the envoys will do much.
NASA supporters have not used force to back up their demands, they have assembled and protested peacefully, unlike the government, who as the above FT editorial noted, “is using brute force to impose authority…which only exacerbates tensions.”
WHETHER SWORN IN OR NOT
While their dismay over the swearing-in is entirely understandable, Nasarites should recognize that Raila and their leadership can still do everything that they think is needed without having been sworn in. Those sworn in were not going to have command of the nation's armed forces, or of the Treasury. Raila and NASA's greatest strength is the number of Kenyans who back them.
Whether as a symbolically sworn-in president or as NASA leader, they can call them to assemble or demonstrate peacefully to back up justified demands that could paralyze government and business.
Biting economic boycotts could still be organized against more business operations that support dictatorship or other unlawful actions.
County governments and Governors can enhance security and economic opportunities.
At the same time, Nasarites should be aware of how fundamentally asymmetrical this struggle is in terms of the capacity to use force. If they began retaliating with violence, the other side has massive amounts of firepower that it has shown it is ready to use.
So relying on peaceful and constitutional means to win back democracy, or indeed self-determination, is the principled thing to do – and is also in NASA's own interest.
At the end of the day, having been sworn in as President, the ball is very much in Uhuru Kenyatta's court.

A Bridgeport man has pleaded guilty charges they supplied heroin to a man who fatally overdosed at a Monroe home in November 2016.
Thirty-four-year-old Careem “C-Lows” Bentley pleaded guilty to distribution of heroin in New Haven federal court Monday, according to the US Attorney's office.
Authorities said that on Nov. 23, 2016, Monroe police and emergency medical personnel responded to a suspected drug overdose at a home in Monroe. When they arrived first responders found a 37-year-old man unresponsive lying on the floor. They were pronounced dead.
Investigators determined that the man had purchased heroin from Bentley the night before.
Bentley was arrested on Apr. 26, 2017 and remains in custody.  They are scheduled for sentencing on Nov. 3, 2017 and faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
SYDNEY: Large protests were held across Australia on Saturday against Indian mining giant Adani Enterprises' proposed Carmichael coal mine, which would be the country's largest coal mine but has been delayed for years over environmental and financing issues.
Environment groups say the mine in Queensland state would contribute to global warming and damage the Great Barrier Reef.
The "Stop Adani" movement organised 45 protests.
On the sands of Sydney's Bondi Beach more than 1,000 people formed a human sign saying '#STOP ADANI', said organiser Blair Palese from activist group 350.
"I think there's a very real national concern that goes beyond Queensland about the idea of giving this mine a billion-dollar taxpayer-funded loan," they said.
The national rallies come as new polling shows more than half of Australians oppose the mine, reported local media.

Analysts have raised doubts about whether Adani can fund the mine, at an initial cost of US$4 billion, given a global backlash to investment in fossil fuels.
Adani says the project would pay billions of dollars in royalties and taxes, create jobs and export coal to India help bring electricity to rural regions.
Adani has been counting on a AUS$900 million (US$704 million) loan from the Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) for a rail link to the proposed mine.
The company's chief executive officer Jeyakumar Janakaraj, however, has said Adani may not have to borrow from NAIF. "If the commercial banks take off all the debt then we will not have any need for NAIF as there will be no gap."
The Australian Conservation Foundation president Geoff Cousins, one of the country's top business people, said it was unlikely Adani could proceed without the NAIF loan.
"They've tried hard to secure commercial funding, but no bank will touch them," they said.
"Stop Adani is an issues-based campaign, and the rest of the world sees the madness of building one of the world's largest coal mines particularly when Australia has signed the Paris Agreement (on climate change)."

Britain must permanently return all artefacts from Ethiopia held by the Victoria and Albert Museum and Addis Ababa will not accept them on loan, an Ethiopian government official said.
The call comes after the museum, one of London's most popular tourist attractions, put Ethiopian treasures plundered by British forces in 1868 on display.
"Well, it would be exciting if the items held at the V&A could be part of a long-term loan with a cultural institution in Ethiopia," museum director Tristram Hunt said.
"These items have never been on a long-term loan in Ethiopia, but as we look to the future I think what we're interested in are partnerships around conservation, interpretation, heritage management, and these need to be supported by government assistance so that institutions like the V&A can support sister institutions in Ethiopia."
Among the items on display are sacred manuscripts and gold taken from the Battle of Maqdala 150 years ago, when British troops ransacked the fortress of Emperor Tewodros II.
The offer of a loan did not go far enough for Ethiopia.
"What we have asked (for) was the restitution of our heritage, our Maqdala heritage, looted from Maqdala 150 years ago. We presented our request in 2007 and we are waiting for it," government minister Hirut Woldemariam said.
Ephrem Amare, Ethiopian National Museum director, added: "It is clearly known where these treasures came from and whom they belong to. Our main demand has never been to borrow them. Ethiopia's demand has always been the restoration of those illegally looted treasures. Not to borrow them."
The V&A said on Tuesday the idea of a long-term loan had come up as it discussed its Maqdala exhibition with Ethiopian authorities. "The V&A is committed to continuing this important and wide-ranging dialogue with colleagues at the Ethiopian Embassy in London," it added in a statement.
In launching the Maqdala 1868 exhibition of what Hunt called "stunning pieces with a complex history" this month, they said the display had been organised in consultation with the Ethiopian community in London.
"As custodians of these Ethiopian treasures, we have a responsibility to celebrate the beauty of their craftsmanship, shine a light on their cultural and religious significance and reflect on their living meaning, while being open about how they came to Britain," they said in a blog on the museum website.
Snapchat is facing backlash after its chief executive allegedly said they didn't want to expand “into poor countries like India and Spain.”
The alleged remarks were described in a lawsuit by former employee Anthony Pompliano, who worked at the Venice company for three weeks in 2015 before being fired.
As part of the lawsuit, Pompliano said they raised concerns about Snapchat's low usage in India and Spain, which they saw as potential growth areas. Pompliano alleges that Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said the app was “only for rich people,” and opposed expanding “into poor countries like India and Spain,” before storming out of the meeting.
After Variety published the allegation last week, Indian publications picked up the story. At least one of them attributed the comments directly to Spiegel rather than to Pompliano's lawsuit.
Twitter users adopted the hashtag #boycottSnapchat to rail against the app. Users have given the app a one-star rating on the Apple app store and Google Play app store in protest. (“Just installed the app so that i can tell you the power of poor indians. I wasted my data just to give rating. Now removing it from my phone now and forever,” wrote one Google Play reviewer.)
Snapchat parent company Snap Inc. called the allegation “ridiculous.”
“Those words were written by a disgruntled former employee,” the company said in a statement. “We are grateful for our Snapchat community in India and around the world.”
The company, however, has made clear that it intends to expand in areas with the highest potential for advertising revenue and the most robust infrastructure.
The company admits in Securities and Exchange Commission filings that its app won't find many users in countries where top-of-the-line smartphones are rare and speedy mobile broadband is limited.
Snap has said most of its daily active users are concentrated in the top 10 advertising markets worldwide — a list topped by the U.S., China, Japan and Britain. It does not include India or Spain.
Citing market research firm IDC, Snap said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that these top 10 markets command more than 70% of overall ad dollars and nearly 85% of mobile ad spending.
Pompliano is seeking a court order to prevent Snap from misrepresenting why they were fired when prospective employers call the company. They claim Snap labels them as incompetent; in their view, Spiegel wanted them fired for internally raising concerns about usage data.
In the suit, Pompliano also alleges that Snap misled investors and advertisers.
The suit was filed in January, but included portions redacted at Pompliano's request to protect Snap's trade secrets. Pompliano recently asked a judge to unseal the lawsuit because of public interest.
Snap released an un-redacted version of the suit before the court could rule on the matter, noting that some of its usage data is no longer private because Snap is now a publicly traded company.

Thousands of Californians will be allowed to take their names off the state's registry of sex offenders as a result of action Friday by Gov. Jerry Brown.
Brown signed legislation that, when it takes effect Jan. 1, will end lifetime listings for lower-level offenders judged to be at little risk of committing new crimes.
The measure was introduced at the request of Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey and other law enforcement officials who said the registry, which has grown to more than 105,000 names, is less useful to detectives investigating new sex crimes because it is so bulky.
“California's sex offender registry is broken, which undermines public safety,” said Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), who introduced the bill. “SB 384 refocuses the sex offender registry on high-risk offenders and treats low-level offenders more fairly.”
The registry currently requires law enforcement officials to spend hours on paperwork for annual evaluations of every offender, including those who are low risk and have not committed a crime for decades, Wiener said.
Brown declined to comment Friday, but their office referred to a statement put out last month.
“SB 384 proposes thoughtful and balanced reforms that allow prosecutors and law enforcement to focus their resources on tracking sex offenders who pose a real risk to public safety, rather than burying officers in paperwork that has little public benefit,” said Ali Bay, a spokesperson for the governor, last month.
The measure was opposed by many Republican lawmakers and Erin Runnion, who in 2002 founded the Joyful Child Foundation, an Orange County advocacy group for victims, after the abduction, molestation and murder of their 5-year-old daughter, Samantha.
Runnion said parents should be able to check a comprehensive registry to see if a potential teacher, youth league coach or babysitter for their children has ever been convicted of a sex crime.
California is one of only four states that require lifetime registration of sex offenders. The others are Alabama, South Carolina and Florida.
The new law signed by the governor creates a tiered registry, with high-risk offenders on the registry for life and others able to petition to be removed after either 10 or 20 years without re-offending, depending on the offense.
Offenses for which registrants can be removed from the list after 20 years include include rape by deception and lewd and lascivious behavior with a child under 14.
Offenders who petition for removal after 10 or 20 years will be assessed by a judge — with input from the local district attorney — who can grant or deny the petition.
The registry can be checked by members of the public, including people doing background checks on potential hires or tenants.
Wiener and gay rights activists said it is unfair that the registry includes the names of people caught having consensual sex parks decades ago, when law enforcement often targeted gay men for enforcement.
Beşiktaş are set to send their Portuguese star Ricardo Quaresma to China after transferring defender Dusco Tosic.
According to a report by Sabah newspaper, "Beşiktaş and a Chinese football club agreed on an 8-million-euro deal for Quaresma. The Portuguese star will be paid 6 million euros per season on a two year contract."
Earlier, Beşiktaş sold Tosic to China's Guangzhouin for 4.5 million euros.
BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) — Construction at the new John R. Oshei Children's Hospital is more than 95 percent complete. At this point crews are just working on the finishing touches and getting ready for the big move from Women & Children's Hospital to the new site.
“Moving from a 125 year old hospital into a brand-new state of the art facility with all the new technologies that come with that,” said Jessica Mabie, Women & Children's Hospital Director of Strategic Planning.
Updated technology, amenities for kids and families, and a more efficient use of space are all expected to improve the patient experience at the new Oishei Children's Hospital.
“This effort has been a significant undertaking you know really back dating beyond 2012,” said Mabie.
Each room, like operating rooms, were designed with patients in mind.
“We monitor the differential pressures in the room to make sure the air within the room is changed out the required amount of times per hour and also to keep the patient isolated,” said Fran Slavin, Turner Construction Superintendent.
A lot of the rooms are currently empty, but before long more equipment and furniture from the old site will fill up the new space.
“A lot of what we call mock moves that have been happening both on the equipment side and the patient transport side so we've had a lot of practice in dealing with how that timing is all going to flow,” said Mabie.
Emergency helicopters will be able to get patients into the hospital quickly through a helipad on the top of the building.
“We actually sped up the elevator early on in the design process so that it could make sure to shave a couple seconds off from the helipad down to the area,” said Slavin.
Now all that's left to do on this helipad is paint a big H. Then it will be ready to receive emergency patients this November when the brand new Oishei Children's hHspital is slated to open.

South Coast Plaza debuted an exhibit Tuesday that tells the story of the Segerstrom family's journey from its farming roots to developers of a luxury retail center.
As part of its 50th anniversary celebration, the exhibit, “Segerstrom Pioneering Spirit: An American Dream,” is on display in the shopping center's Jewel Court and will run till July 31.
The installation traces the family of C.J. and Bertha Segerstrom who immigrated to the U.S. from Sweden and established C.J. Segerstrom & Sons, an agricultural and commercial real estate enterprise in Southern California. The family then developed South Coast Plaza and ultimately played a significant role in establishing Segerstrom Center for the Arts.
The exhibit features never-before-seen photographs and historical information, curated from the personal archives of Ruth Ann Moriarty, the last living third-generation descendant of C.J. and Bertha Segerstrom. Moriarty is the sister of Henry T. Segerstrom, who co-founded South Coast Plaza in 1967 with their first cousin, Hal Segerstrom.
The exhibit also showcases Segerstrom-commissioned art sculptures “Oiseau” by Joan Miro and “Tour Aux Jambes” by Jean Dubuffet, as well as a vintage tractor from the Costa Mesa lima bean farm symbolizing the family's agricultural roots.
South Coast Plaza expects 1 million visitors to visit the exhibit's seven-week summer run.
South Coast Plaza is at 3333 Bristol St., Costa Mesa. For more information, call (800) 782-8888 or visit southcoastplaza.com.

It seems AMC is trying to get its ducks in a row with the reports that Andrew Lincoln is leaving The Walking Dead.
The network has now, apparently, offered Norman Reedus $20 million to take the British actor's place as the show's lead.
Reedus has starred in The Walking Dead since the show first aired, along with Lincoln, and their character Daryl Dixon is a long-term fan favourite who could easily transition into the central role.
The Hollywood Reporter claim this would be a significant pay rise for the American actor who has appeared in all eight of the previous seasons and is currently in Atlanta filming season nine.
The exit of Lincoln, who plays Rick Grimes, is said to be a shock but writers will gradually phase them out in season nine along with co-star Lauren Cohan who plays Maggie.
Goodbye Grimes! A source told The Wrap that Andrew Lincoln, who plays Rick Grimes on “The Walking Dead,” will not be returning after Season 9 of the zombie drama ends. More
The series is based on Robert Kirkman's ongoing comic series and their story still revolves around Rick so the show's writers will have to come up with some more original material in order to transition Lincoln out and Reedus into the lead.
It's also unclear if Danai Gurira (Michonne) will return to The Walking Dead following their breakout film role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Them performances as Okoye in both Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War has been praised by fans and critics alike so they may well be looking to take advantage and secure more big screen roles.
The Walking Dead airs on AMC in the US and on FOX and NOW TV in the UK.

WWE News: Finn Balor posts a photo along with 'Broken' Matt and 'Brother Nero' with an interesting caption
Too sweet!
@conciousxplode by Lennard Surrao News 14 Aug 2017, 08:31 IST
The Demon King seems to have taken a liking to the Broken Universe!
What's the story?
If you've been an ardent follower of Finn Balor on Twitter, you may know the Demon King has a penchant for teasing moments that are sure to send the fans into a frenzy.
Well, he's at it again!
The former Universal Champion posted a photo along with Matt and Jeff Jardy along with a caption that read, "Broken Matt, Brother Nero, You have #WOKEN 'Fatal' Finn Bálor."
Check out the epic tweet below:
In case you didn't know...
Finn Balor is currently embroiled in a feud with Bray Wyatt and they will face the Eater of Worlds at SummerSlam on August 20th.
The Hardy Boyz, however, are left with any credible opponents after Scott Dawson got injured that will potentially keep them out of action until December.
The heart of the matter
The ongoing legal battle between the Hardys and their former employers Impact Wrestling over the rights of the Broken gimmick have forced the WWE to smartly alter the gimmick.
Instead of being Broken, the legendary tag team champions are now woken! A brilliant move until the legal formalities is done with regarding the popular gimmick, we say!
On a side note, we would love to see Fatal Finn Balor and the Broken ones team up more often in the WWE!
What's next?
The biggest PPV of the summer is all set to go on floors on August 20th and we just can't wait! While Finn Balor has their task cut out for himself, the WWE are frantically searching for a replacement and the same would be known on the go-home episode of RAW.
Author's take
The return of the Hardys has given the fans the opportunity to witness some dream pairings. Dean Ambrose teaming up with the brothers on an episode of RAW was one instance and now Balor doing the same at house shows just makes things just too sweet!
Talking about the Woken brothers, who would you like to see them face at SummerSlam with the Revival being out? Sounds off in the comments section.
Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson intends to use their last European experience to shape their future ones as the Reds look to secure their return to the Champions League.
The England midfielder is one of only three survivors from the team which lost the Europa League final to Sevilla in Basle in May 2016.
As they set out to convert their fourth-placed Premier League finish into a place in Europe's elite for the first time since the autumn of 2014 Henderson is drawing on bitter experience for motivation.
"That was a tough night for us as a team. Losing in any final but particularly a European final is tough," they said of the Basle experience, where Liverpool went 1-0 up but fell apart in the second half and lost 3-1.
"You have to use that and make sure you do not have that feeling again and we will use that going into the game and that anger, if you like, to have a good Euro campaign so hopefully it will help us to go forward."
Manager Jurgen Klopp knows this is a chance they cannot afford to squander against Hoffenheim - a tough prospect against a team who finished finished fourth in the Bundesliga - having worked so hard to hang on to a top-four spot last season.
"We fought really hard for this opportunity," they said.
"After we beat Middlesbrough in May we knew we were fourth but we had no idea if we were seeded or not.
"The night we celebrated someone came in and said: 'We're seeded.' Everyone was really happy and then we saw who we could still get.
"There is a job to do. For three months we've been looking forward to this game. We're in a good mood.
"We know about the qualities of the opponent and the difficulty of the challenge but it's just good to be here after a long time.
"It's good to have the chance to do it, even though we know it will be hard. We know more about Hoffenheim than you can imagine.
"They are strong, we are strong and both have the big aim to go into the group stage so that makes it really exciting."

DETROIT U.S. immigration authorities have arrested and moved to deport 199 Iraqi immigrants, mostly from the Detroit area, in the last three weeks after Iraq agreed to accept deportees as part of a deal removing it from President Donald Trump's travel ban, officials said on Wednesday.In the Detroit area, 114 Iraqi nationals were arrested over the weekend, and 85 throughout the rest of the country over the past several weeks, Gillian Christensen, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson, said in a statement. The actions came as part of the Trump administration's push to increase immigration enforcement and make countries, which have resisted in the past, take back nationals ordered deported from the United States.The crackdown on Iraqi immigrants followed the U.S. government's decision to drop Iraq from a list of Muslim-majority nations targeted by a revised version of Trump's temporary travel ban issued in March.
The overwhelming majority of those arrested had criminal convictions for crimes including murder, rape, assault, kidnapping, burglary, drug trafficking, weapons violations and other offences, Christensen said.As of April 17, 2017, there were 1,444 Iraqi nationals with final orders for removal, they said. Since the March 12 agreement with Iraq regarding deportees, eight Iraqi nationals have been removed to Iraq.
Dozens of Iraqi Chaldean Catholics in Detroit were among those targeted in the immigration sweeps, some of whom fear they will be killed if deported to their home country, immigration attorneys and family members said. “It is very worrisome that ICE has signalled its intention to remove Chaldean Christians to Iraq where their safety not only cannot be guaranteed, but where they face persecution and death for their religious beliefs,” Martin Manna, president of the Chaldean Community Foundation, said in a statement on Wednesday.
Kurdish Iraqis also were picked up in Nashville, Tennessee, attorneys, activists and family members said.At least some of those arrested came to the United States as children, got in trouble and already served their sentences, according to immigration attorneys and activists. Some have lived in the United States so long they no longer speak Arabic.An Iraqi official previously said Iraqi diplomatic and consular missions would coordinate with U.S. authorities to issue travel documents for the deportees.

President Donald Trump kept up their attack on the escalating Russia investigation, insisting in a new tweet Monday that it was "a total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!" The comment came a day after a top White House lawyer tried to calm speculation that the president was considering firing the special counsel leading the probe.
White House lawyer Ty Cobb offered a statement late Sunday after top congressional Republicans warned of repercussions if Trump fired special counsel Robert Mueller, who is looking into contacts between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia and Russian meddling in the presidential election.
In a series of weekend tweets, Trump jabbed directly at Mueller by name for the first time. The president challenged the investigation's existence and suggested political bias on the part of Mueller's investigators. Trump has long been frustrated by the lengthy and intensifying probe, and insists their campaign did not collude with Russia to influence the election in their favor.
"The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime," they said in a late Saturday tweet.
Likely contributing to Trump's sense of frustration, The New York Times reported last week that Mueller had subpoenaed the Trump Organization for Russia-related documents. Trump had said Mueller would cross a red line with such a step.
"Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans?" they tweeted Sunday.
Some of Mueller's investigators indeed have contributed to Democratic political candidates, but Justice Department policy and federal service law bar discrimination in the hiring of career positions on the basis of political affiliation. Mueller is a Republican.
The tweets revived talk that Trump may, in an attempt to end the investigation, move to have Mueller fired. Cobb sought to tamp down the speculation.
"In response to media speculation and related questions being posed to the Administration, the White House yet again confirms that the President is not considering or discussing the firing of the Special Counsel, Robert Mueller," they said.
Trump on Monday tweeted: "A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!"
Earlier Sunday, members of Congress, including some top Republicans, warned Trump to not even think about terminating Mueller.
"If they tried to do that, that would be the beginning of the end of their presidency," said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump ally.
Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., chairperson of the House Oversight and Government Reform panel, warned Trump that a Mueller firing would be a distraction from the president's agenda.
"Let it play out its course," Gowdy said on "Fox News Sunday." ''If you've done nothing wrong, you should want the investigation to be as fulsome and thorough as possible.
House Speaker Paul Ryan said through a spokesperson that "Mr. Mueller and their team should be able to do their job."
And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., tweeted that it is "critical" Mueller be allowed to complete a thorough investigation "unimpeded."
Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., called for passage of stalled bipartisan bills designed to protect Mueller. They said Trump "is engaged in desperate and reckless conduct to intimidate their law enforcement agencies of this country and to try and stop the special counsel. That is unacceptable in a democracy."
Trump cannot directly fire Mueller, who can only be dismissed for cause. Any dismissal would have to be carried out by Rod Rosenstein, the Trump-appointed deputy attorney general who has publicly expressed support for Mueller.
Trump has fumed to confidants that the Mueller probe is "going to choke the life out of" their presidency if allowed to continue unabated indefinitely, according to an outside adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations with the president.
Trump has long believed that the entrenched bureaucracy, particularly at the Justice Department and FBI, is out to thwart him. They fumed to one confidant after seeing a promotion for a forthcoming book by James Comey, the FBI director they fired last year, believing Comey will seek to enrich themselves by besmirching Trump's reputation. Comey's book, "A Higher Loyalty," topped Amazon.com's best-seller list on Sunday.
The president also has long been torn over how to approach the probe. Their legal team, namely Cobb, has counseled Trump to cooperate with Mueller. But some former campaign advisers have urged Trump to be combative, warning that the investigation poses an existential threat to their presidency.
Aides and friends say they understand Trump's frustration.
Marc Short, Trump's congressional liaison, said the frustration is "well-warranted" because "there has been no evidence whatsoever of collusion."
Trump may have felt emboldened after Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe on Friday, something Trump had clamored for out of a belief that McCabe was part of the entrenched, anti-Trump bureaucracy. "A great day for Democracy," Trump tweeted afterward. Trump asserted without elaboration that McCabe knew "all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!"
The Associated Press later reported that McCabe kept personal memos detailing interactions with Trump that have been provided to Mueller's office and are similar to notes compiled by Comey. Trump sought to cast doubt on their veracity, tweeting Sunday that they spent "very little time" with McCabe "but they never took notes when they were with me."
"I don't believe they made memos except to help their own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?" Trump tweeted. It wouldn't be unusual for a senior official to make notes soon after meeting with the president.
The contents of McCabe's memos are unknown, but they could help substantiate McCabe's assertion that they were unfairly maligned by a White House they say had declared "war" on the FBI and Mueller's investigation.
Sessions said they dismissed McCabe on the recommendation of FBI disciplinary officials who said McCabe had not been candid with a watchdog office investigation. An upcoming inspector general's report is expected to conclude that McCabe had authorized the release of information to the media and was not forthcoming with the watchdog office as it examined the bureau's handling of an investigation into Democrat Hillary Clinton's emails.
McCabe has vigorously disputed the allegations and said their credibility came under attack as "part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally" but also the FBI and law enforcement.
Mueller is investigating whether Trump's actions, including Comey's ouster, constitute obstruction of justice.

State troopers on Thursday filed charges alleging a Scranton man is a bookie using an illegal gambling website who collected debts at Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs.
William Schreiber, 32, of 634 N. Irving Ave., is charged with five counts of engaging in bookmaking for offenses allegedly committed in March.
State police say one informant "feared" Schreiber and one of their associates when confronted over a debt in a poker room at the casino, and that when people lost bets, Schreiber got a 50-cent "juice" payment - the fee for their services - for every $5 lost.
According to a police affidavit, a person identified only as confidential source No. 1 in May reported paying Schreiber $200 and $250 on separate occasions for losing a bet on a gambling website, www.wager2020.com.
The site's domain registry indicates the site is based in San Jose, Costa Rica. It advertises itself as a company providing "sport books data processing services" that facilitates transactions between betters and bookies.
All bets are between bookies and bettors, according to the site.
"Wager2020 neither accepts payments from players nor does it make payments to players," a disclaimer on the website says. "If you make a deposit into your account, it is on behalf of your sports book."
Another informant, confidential source No. 2, also reported meeting with another confidential source on three occasions to help the source make payments to Schreiber for gambling losses on the website, the affidavit says.
The second informant had used the website twice and had paid gambling debts to Schreiber, including a 10 percent "juice" payment, the affidavit says.
The informant told troopers Schreiber and a friend of theirs had appeared in a poker room at Mohegan Sun and "had words" with someone about money owed, police said.
After speaking to police, the informant agreed to get money to Schreiber through a third party because the informant was afraid of Schreiber and their friend, the affidavit says. According to police, the informant gave the third party $150, $200, and $400 on three separate occasions with instructions that the money be deposited in Schreiber's bank account.
Police say before the transactions, Schreiber texted the informant asking if the informant would be willing to go through a third party, and the informant agreed.
The state police Bureau of Criminal Investigation charged Schreiber by summons Thursday at the office of Magisterial District Judge Diana Malast. A preliminary hearing was set for 10:15 a.m. Oct. 10.
It's not the first time illegal bookmaking charges have come out of the casino. In January, two casino employees - Jason Singleman, 41, of Nicholson, and Patrick O'Donnell, 48, of Wilkes-Barre - were charged with conspiracy to engage in bookmaking and disorderly conduct for allegedly collecting on bets made on the same website.
Court records show both men pleaded guilty to the disorderly conduct charges and had the bookmaking charges withdrawn. They were fined $450.
But Mike Bean, president and general manager of Mohegan Sun, said Thursday that Schreiber is not a casino employee and that they had not previously heard about the allegations.
They said the casino cooperates with law enforcement in such investigations but that it had not been contacted in Schreiber's case.

The contractor who shut down Donald Trump's Twitter account has told Reuters they did so by mistake, but says they believe some of the US president's recent tweets breach the social network's ban on hate speech.
Bahtiyar Duysak, 28, said they clicked “a few wrong things which I shouldn't have done” on 2 Nov., their last day at Twitter, causing Trump's @realDonaldTrump account - which has 44 million followers - to be taken offline for 11 minutes.
At the time, Twitter blamed a customer support employee on their last day at work and has since said it has taken steps to prevent such an incident happening again. Trump blamed a “rogue employee” for the temporary loss of their account.
In an interview in Frankfurt, Duysak told Reuters they aren't paying attention when a complaint came in an hour before they were to leave Twitter's San Francisco office for the last time, after cutting short a six-month assignment.
They thought they were dealing with one of many fake Trump accounts.
“You should always double-check things before taking an action,” Duysak told Reuters Television.
Twitter has not confirmed whether Duysak was the ex-employee responsible. The company declined to comment on Duysak's actions or its investigation into the matter when contacted by Reuters.
Duysak said that some of Trump's posts since the incident - in particular their retweeting of anti-Islamic videos posted by a British far-right fringe group - were a breach of Twitter's rules banning hate speech.
“You don't need to be an expert to understand that a policy violation has happened, that the rules were broken and that this can lead to hatred being spread,” they said.
Twitter said it had no comment, and the White House did not respond to a request for comment.
After stints at Youtube and Google, Duysak joined Twitter as a safety policy operations agent on July 24, according to correspondence seen by Reuters. The job involved checking violations of Twitter's rules that could not be dealt with by its automatic computer systems.
Duysak, born in Germany to a family of Turkish origin, left the United States a few days after the incident and returned to their hometown of Paderborn. They said they had hired a lawyer who liaised with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and assured them they had no case to answer.
They said they had apologised to, and made peace with, Twitter.
In this April 6, 2017, file photo, former United States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton speaks during the Eighth Annual Women In The World Summit at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City.
For over 600 days, Hillary Clinton's pastor wrote daily inspirational letters drawn from Biblical scripture during the presidential campaign.
Hundreds of those letters have now been compiled in a book, "Strong For a Moment Like This." The collection features a letter sent in the aftermath of their election loss.
Rev. Dr. Bill Shillady, the New York-based executive director of the United Methodist City Society, has been a longtime friend and pastor to the former U.S. secretary of state, senator and first lady.
“I wrote to them on a daily basis. If I was not writing then there was team of writers,” Shillady said during a phone interview with NBC.
The collection, published by Abingdon Press, includes 365 of the more than 600 devotions written for Clinton, along with personal notes, portions of their speeches, and headlines that provide context for that day's devotion.
“On the difficult days, like the terrorist incidents, we dug deep and found gratitude for life,” they said.
The day after the 2016 election, Shillady sent a letter beginning with the title "Sunday Is Coming" and ending with one of their cherished phrases.
"You know one of my favorite sayings is 'God doesn't close one door without opening another, but it can be hell in the hallway,'" they wrote in the last paragraph. "My sister Hillary. You, our nation, our world is experiencing a black Friday. Our hope is that Sunday is coming. But it might well be hell for a while."
Here is the letter "Sunday Is Coming":
According to Shillady, the post-election letter has been shared over 40,000 times on social media. The letter shares the struggle of disciples after the loss of Jesus Christ and the reminder that for Clinton there was more to be grateful for in life.
“Most of the response has been positive and some thought I was comparing them to Christ — that is simply not true,” they said. “If you really read it then you will understand.“
The book, "Strong For a Moment Like This," is due for sale in stores and online on Aug. 15.
Shillady and their team of writers came from different backgrounds, including Presbyterian, Baptist and a clergy of women. All the clergy writers, hopeful about the outcome of the election, used daily news headlines as a source of inspiration for the devotions.
“A German theologian Karl Barth said something like 'a pastor is not worth their weight if they don't have a newspaper in one hand and a Bible in the other,'” they said. “[The devotions] reminded them that they were child of God and of their strength, qualities this campaign demanded from her.”
NBC contacted the Clinton Foundation for a comment about the book and have not yet received a response.
Shillady said each chapter in the book is organized into 12 themes, such as forgiveness, doing good, courage, and women.
NEW YORK, Aug 14 (APP): Leaders of the Democratic Party responded to reports of violence and racial clashes at a white nationalist rally in the US State of Virginia on Saturday with calls for introspection on matters of racial hatred, according to American media reports.

CINCINNATI: Rafael Nadal was assured a return to world number one for the first time since July of 2014 on Monday (Aug 14) when 19-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer withdrew from this week's ATP Cincinnati Masters tournament.
Third-ranked Federer said they injured their back in Montreal, where they lost in the final to Germany's Alexander Zverev.
Federer, this year's Wimbledon and Australian Open champion, was the only player who could have denied world number two Nadal the top spot in next Monday's rankings.
The 31-year-old Spaniard, who won their 15th Grand Slam title at this year's French Open, will overtake Britain's top-ranked Andy Murray, who withdrew from Montreal and Cincinnati with a hip injury.
Federer, a seven-time champion on the Cincinnati hardcourts, could yet move into the world number one spot, but their next chance will come at the US Open, the year's final Grand Slam event that begins Aug 28 in New York.
"I am very sorry to pull out of the Western and Southern Open as I always enjoy playing," Federer said. "Cincinnati has some of the best fans in the world and I am sorry I will miss them.

"Unfortunately, I tweaked my back in Montreal and I need to rest this week."
Nadal, who has spent 141 total weeks in the top spot, became world number one for the first time in August 2008 after a semi-final run at Cincinnati.
For Federer to have taken the top spot at Cincinnati, they would have had to at least reach the semi-finals. Had Federer reached the final, Nadal would have had to win the title to stop the Swiss star from becoming number one.
Federer will be replaced in the men's draw by Italian lucky loser Thomas Fabbiano, the world number 85 who will enjoy a first-round bye and face either Argentina's Diego Schwartzman or Russia's Karen Khachanov in the second round.
A woman was reportedly found in one of the bedrooms in Drake's house earlier this month.
One of the rapper's entourage reportedly walked into their California mansion at 10:30pm local time on 3 April and found a 24-year-old woman, who hasn't been named, wearing one of the One Dance singer's hooded sweaters in one of the bedrooms, according to TMZ.com.
Police officers were called to the scene, where the woman claimed they had been allowed to enter the property, which was reportedly untrue. They also confessed to taking some of Drake's drinks including Pepsi, Sprite and Fiji Water.
They were arrested and charged with felony burglary. Law enforcement sources have told TMZ there were no signs of forced entry, so it is unclear how they gained access to the property.
Drake was not in at the time of the incident.
This isn't the first time the 30-year-old has been a victim of a burglary. The tour bus they shared with Future was targeted while the duo were performing in Phoenix, Arizona in September.
A 21-year-old named Travion King was allegedly caught on surveillance footage and booked on a burglary charge. They reportedly took a briefcase full of jewellery, worth US$3 million, which was subsequently returned to the rappers.
KMazur/WireImageDon't get on the Beyhive's bad side. That's a lesson rock legend Carlos Santana learned after giving an interview to the New Zealand Herald in which they called Beyonce‘s work “music to model a dress” to and said, “she's not a singer, singer.”
Santana took to Facebook Tuesday evening to clarify their remarks. “My intent was to congratulate Adele on their amazing night at the Grammies. [sic] My comment about Beyonce was regretfully taken out of context,” the guitarist and Rock and Roll Hall of Famer wrote. “I have the utmost respect for them as an artist and a person. They deserve all the accolades that come their way. I wish Beyonce and their family all the best.”
On Tuesday, the New Zealand Herald quoted Santana as saying of Adele's victory over Beyonce for Album of the Year at Sunday's Grammys, “I think that Adele won because they can sing, sing.” They added, “With all respect to our sister Beyonce, Beyonce is very beautiful to look at and it's more like modelling kind of music — music to model a dress — she's not a singer, singer, with all respect to her.”
Beyonce fans took to Twitter to criticize Santana Tuesday with one writing of their Grammy performance, “Beyonce sang on point while falling backward in a chair and didn't miss a beat or lose breath with twins on their diaphragm.” Others noted that Beyonce and Santana had performed together at a pre-game event at Super Bowl 37 in 2003.

LONDON: Thousands of people marched through central London on Saturday (Feb 3) in support of the country's embattled National Health Service (NHS), which is straining under the weight of winter demand.
NHS staffing levels have been in crisis for months, an issue made worse by a winter flu outbreak.
The public health service is a highly-emotive political issue, and controversially formed the centre-piece of the succesful pro-Brexit campaign during the 2016 referendum.
Protesters carrying placards reading "NHS not for sale", and "Hands off our NHS", braved the cold and rain to demand that the government pump more money into the system, and roll back the influence of the private sector in the public-funded service.
Hospital campaigner Tamsyn Bacchus demonstrated with a life-size replica vulture and an NHS placard, fearing that the free-at-point-of-use service was moving towards a US style user-pay system.
"I have faith, and so do all these folk here, that it's so important ... when your child is running a high fever, when you need the hospital or a doctor you can get them without worrying about having to pay for it," they told the Press Association.

There are 40,000 vacant nurse posts in England, according to the Royal College of Nursing, with 27 per cent more nurses and midwives leaving the job between 2016 and 2017 than joining.
Numerous doctors have taken to social media in recent weeks to apologise to patients, with one emergency doctor in central England warning of "third-world conditions".
During the 2016 EU referendum, the Leave campaign's battlebus that carried leading figures such as Boris Johnson around the country was emblazoned with the disputed claim that the NHS could receive up to £350 million (US$494 million) extra per week if Britain no longer had to fund the EU.
Both Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao and their Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee called their meeting in Kolkata “a good beginning” towards the formation of an alternative federal front to take on the ruling BJP in the 2019 general elections. But, as they say, the devil lies in the details.While it seemed that KCR visualised that “alternative federal front” as a strictly non-Congress, non-BJP platform, Mamata preferred to not entirely shut the doors on the Congress whose president Rahul Gandhi gave out signals for tie-ups with like-minded regional parties during its 84th plenary session.“If you replace the BJP with the Congress, will there be a miracle? What this country needs is a miracle. Something great needs to be done. It has to be revolutionary. The country needs to change, re-invent and re-orient itself,” Rao said while explaining the broad lines of the prospective federal front after meeting Banerjee at the West Bengal state secretariat, Nabanna, for about 90 minutes on Monday afternoon.Asked whether they would accept outside support from the Congress if the situation so warranted, Rao said: “You are thinking routine political models. Our agenda would be different from these routine models. It would be people's agenda which is not meant for any political parties or their leaders.”“You know what has been happening in this country for the last 71 years and you still want that same routine model to continue?” the Telengana CM asked in justification for their non-Congress non-BJP stand.In contrast, Mamata sounded far more careful about drawing the contours of the prospective federal front which they have consistently and vociferously advocated over the past few years while taking on the Modi government at the Centre.Asked about keeping the Congress out they said, “You don't put words in my mouth. Mr. Rao has expressed their views. Where is the harm in that? Rahul (Gandhi) too had expressed their views. We can all have our individual views.”The West Bengal CM said politics can throw up circumstances when all kinds of individuals get the opportunity to work together. “In a democracy, we must develop the culture of working together. We have good relations with other parties and we will maintain that. If we can work together, nothing can be better for this country,” they said, clearly indicating their intentions to keep reaching out to other regional opposition parties for finding a common minimum ground on which a workable alliance could be forged ahead of the 2019 polls.“We have only just started this dialogue. Others would automatically gather around us. We want a strong federal front. If the states are strong, the Centre too would be strong. It's like a collective family. Let us approach the other parties and discuss this matter. We are in no hurry,” they clarified, even as KCR stood next to them and nodded in agreement.Barely 24 hours before KCR called on Mamata in Kolkata, Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu had a telephone conversation with their Bengal counterpart where the two, reportedly, agreed to sit face to discuss matters on the evolving political scenario in the country.Mamata has already welcomed the Telegu Desam Party's decision to quit the NDA over alleged “unfulfilled promises of granting special status to the state” and has pledged support to Naidu in the eventuality of them moving a no-confidence motion in Parliament against the Narendra Modi government.Mamata is also scheduled to travel to Delhi later this month during the ongoing Parliamentary session where they are likely to meet opposition leaders across the board for another round of alliance talks.Incidentally, the Bengal CM has repeatedly maintained that they have little interest in either leading this front or the Prime Minister's chair if their goal of bringing regional opposition forces under one umbrella bears fruit. From Lalu Yadav to Akhilesh Yadav and Naveen Patnaik to even disgruntled NDA allies like Uddhav Thackeray, Mamata has attempted to strike a personal bond with leaders across the political spectrum in the recent past. But contentious issues like supporting the Congress or their stand on the dwindling Left has made them moves so far a tightrope walk.While they flanked KCR at the press conference following Monday's Nabanna meet, the Telengana CM was unequivocal about who would lead the prospective federal front. “Do not worry. It will be a collective leadership. Leaders emerge from situations and sequence of events,” KCR said. Mamata chose not to add to that statement.
Islamabad - The National Highway Authority (NHA) has accorded approval to the PC-1 for construction of infrastructure of Metro Bus Service for Peshawar Morr to New Islamabad International Airport (NIIA).
Presiding over the meeting of the executive board, Chairman NHA Shahid Ashraf Tarar said that all the necessary arrangements are being made for timely completion of Peshawar Morr-NIIA Metro Bus Project. The project will be completed in four packages. Ten stations will be constructed on the route of the metro bus, while three stations will be constructed in future.

Police are looking for an Indio man who has been accused of using a stolen prescription pad to pretend to be a doctor, then writing fake prescriptions and keeping the drugs for himself. (Photo: John Moore, Getty Images)
Coachella Valley police are looking for a local man who has been accused of using a stolen prescription pad to pretend to be a doctor, then writing fake prescriptions and keeping the drugs for himself.
But the scheme used the identities of real patients, who had prescriptions written in their name without their knowledge.
Marc Dobson, 53, of Indio, allegedly swiped prescription pads from a doctor's office where they worked, then told at least two victims they were a doctor and used the pad to write them both prescriptions, according to court documents filed by the Indio Police Department.

One of those victims, who is not identified in court documents, said Dobson wrote them two prescriptions, each for a bottle of pills, which they received. However, what that victim didn't know was that Dobson allegedly wrote another 67 prescriptions in the victim's name, then picked up the drugs himself.
Police say they verified the scheme by interviewing the victims and pharmacy staff and reviewing video footage from the pharmacy, which showed Dobson picking up the drugs.
When confronted, Dobson admitted to stealing the pads and pocketing the drugs, police say in court records.
Dobson was charged with felony identity theft and prescription forgery on Thursday and police have requested a warrant for their arrest. As of Friday afternoon, they were not yet in custody.

Federal funds would pay to take material dredged from the Delaware River to abandoned mines in Hazleton through a bill that U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter said they will sponsor.
Speaking on Monday when dredging began on the river, the Pennsylvania Democrat said they would propose an amendment to Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act that allows for transporting and disposing of the dredged material in mines.
Regarding placement of dredged material, Specter said "arrangements have been made to make use of the abandoned coal mines in Northeastern Pennsylvania, a lot of them located in the Hazleton area where we kill two birds with one stone: a place to take the material and also a way to fill the abandoned mines."
In Hazleton through a plan backed by Mayor Lou Barletta, Hazleton Creek Properties started using dredged material in late 2005 to reclaim a site bounded by Routes 309, 93 and 924 on which the company hopes to build an amphitheater, restaurants and other businesses.
Specter called the start of dredging, which teamed with now-deceased Sen. John Heinz to advocate 27 years ago, a great day for Pennsylvania because of the economic impact.
Deepening the 102-mile shipping channel in the Delaware to 45 feet from 40 feet will create jobs on the ports and spin-off jobs for 125,000 people, Specter estimated.
John Estey, chairperson of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority, estimated that dredging will create 30,000 to 35,000 jobs just at the ports.
Container ships need a deeper channel that dredging will create, Estey said.
"In the next five years, pretty much every ship will require at least 42 feet of water. This is the most important project in the history of the ports along the river," they said.
Specter said all environmental aspects of the project have been "checked and rechecked" and considered in a ruling in federal district court in Delaware that let the project proceed.
Maya van Rossum, the Delaware Riverkeeper, said neither the legal nor environmental findings are so clear.
The ruling issued in late January only allows dredging to start on a 13-mile stretch of the river known as Reach C in the state of Delaware.
By starting to dredge now while appeals that the Riverkeeper network and other organizations have filed are pending, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers could be building a dead-end channel, van Rossum said.
"If that legal action is ultimately won, which I believe it will be, you have the Army Corps of Engineers being irresponsible with the tax dollars of the public," they said.
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie held a news conference at one of the dredge disposal sites along the river at a Revolutionary War fort in their state to say New Jersey will continue a legal fight to stop the dredging.
"The Army Corps expects south (New) Jersey to bear the environmental burden for a project that doesn't make economic sense," Christie said in a statement afterward.
Van Rossum said federal, state and private agencies have raised questions and concerns about environmental impacts. They said questions remain about the effect of deepening the river on aquatic life, public water supplies and wetlands.
The Delaware Bay supports an $80 million oyster fishery. Prehistoric horseshoe crabs conduct mating rituals in greater numbers in the Delaware Bay than anywhere else in the world. Medical researchers need horseshoe crab blood for tests, and migratory birds like the red knot need to feast on horseshoe crab eggs to gain strength to continue their migrations.
"Red knots are literally on the brink of being lost," van Rossum said. If the birds don't get enough to eat in Delaware they get lost on the way or they complete their trips south but can't reproduce when they arrive, they said.
Ed Voigt, spokesperson for the Army Corps of Engineers, said plans to recreate a wetland on Kelly Island off Dover, Del., will help horseshoe crabs.
The legal ruling, Voigt said, allows as much dredging as the Army Corps can afford until the next fiscal year this fall.
By then, the Army Corps expects to obtain more funding and permits that the state of Delaware initially denied for the next stages of the project.
Specter said the federal government made a commitment to the funding the dredging and already approved $77 million. "We'll get whatever funding is needed," they said of the project expected to cost $300 million and take five years.
While New Jersey and Delaware still oppose dredging, the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution gives the federal government the final approval, Specter said.
"Frequently you can't get everybody to agree. That's why it's become a federal matter," they said. "The final determination will be made by the United States government on what is good for the area."
Specter expected Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., to join them in making the announcement, but Casey never joined the telephone conference call with reporters on Monday morning.
Later, Casey's press secretary Stephanie D. Zarecky said Casey is reviewing Specter's amendment to the mine reclamation act. Casey worked to maximize funding for reclaiming mines, Zarecky wrote in an e-mail.
Barletta said the development is good news not only for the Hazleton Creek project but for the state and the nation.
"I think this is going to be a glorious story, not only for Pennsylvania but for the country," Barletta said.
With 70 percent of the abandoned mine lands in America located in Pennsylvania, and 30 percent of the goods shipped into the commonwealth coming through the Delaware Bay and Delaware River, Barletta said deepening the river opens the way for improved shipping, and the by-product of dredging offers clean fill to reclaim mine-scarred land.
"This is beneficial on both ends. It is good for commerce, it is a benefit to the river, and we are reclaiming mineland in one of the largest economic development projects in our history," they said. "I wish the naysayers would sit back and let progress continue."

By Andrew Both
CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Justin Thomas capped off a major season that belonged to an aggressive new breed of fearless young Americans when they stormed to a two-stroke victory at the PGA Championship on Sunday.
At 24, they followed in the footsteps of then-23-year-old Jordan Spieth's British Open triumph and the U.S. Open victory by 27-year-old Brooks Koepka, suggesting a bright future for American golf.
Thomas, one of the longest drivers on tour, started the final major of the year ranked 14th in the world, not one of the favourites after recent poor form, but came through by executing under pressure as many of their rivals withered.
"I just had an unbelievable calmness throughout the week, throughout the day," Thomas said after lifting the Wanamaker Trophy. "I really truly felt I was going to win. I was just very confident. I didn't get flustered.
"I was a lot more calm than I thought I would be. I thought I would be very shaky. At one point I looked at my hand it was a little shaky but that's why you play."
The serenity served Thomas well after a slow start, as they bided their time before vaulting to the front with four birdies in a sizzling seven-hole stretch mid-round.
They then held firm over the dangerous final water-lined three holes, known as the 'Green Mile', hoisting a seven-iron to 15-foot at the par-three 17th before sinking the putt to all but secure victory, a bogey at the last academic as they carded 68 to finish at eight-under 276.
"That was probably one of the best shots I've ever had to a pin that was really brutal," Thomas said of their tee shot at 17.
"I needed to make par. I'll never forget that vision in my head (and) to make a birdie there was beyond a bonus."
Thomas was one of five players tied for the lead early on the back nine, before they broke clear with an unlikely 40-foot chip-in birdie at the par-three 13th.
They celebrated wildly, pumping their fists, perhaps sensing it was a pivotal moment.
"That chip-in on 13 was probably the most berserk I've ever been on the golf course," they said.
As Thomas celebrated, others wondered what might have been, as fellow American Patrick Reed (67) bogeyed the last to finish equal second with Italian Francesco Molinari (67) and South African Louis Oosthuizen (70).
Hideki Matsuyama, seeking to become the first man from Japan to win a major, held the lead briefly mid-round before fading with three consecutive bogeys from the 11th.
They carded 72 and finished three shots behind with American Rickie Fowler (67).
Overnight leader Kevin Kisner (74) finished four shots back.
Thomas, after sinking a 35-foot birdie at the ninth, picked up another shot to tie for the lead at the par-five 10th, where their eight-foot putt stopped on the lip of the cup.
Almost apoplectic with frustration, they wisely took their time walking to the ball, which after remaining stationary for 12 seconds toppled in.
"I acted like a child and threw a little tantrum and then it went in so I didn't look so bad," Thomas said.
"I did a little fit and gravity took over."
Two hours later they were celebrating victory.
"Major champion will never be taken away from my name," they said.

ISLAMABAD - The Supreme Court on Tuesday summoned former finance minister Ishaq Dar and former finance secretary Waqar Masood in a case related to the illegal appointment of Attaul Haq Qasmi as chairperson Pakistan Television Corporation.
The case regarding Qasmi's illegal appointment and millions paid to them in the form of various allowances was heard by a three-member bench of the apex court headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar.
Attorney General for Pakistan Javed Khan while replying to a set of questions framed by the chief justice regarding Qasmi's appointment and the amount paid to them told the bench that there were several irregularities in the process leading to the appointment of the writer as chairperson PTV.
“The legal formalities in the process of appointment were not fulfilled while they were also given relaxation by increasing the maximum age limit in the instant case,” they informed the court, adding; “According to my knowledge, Qasmi was not fulfilling the requisite criteria for the post.”
Justice Ijaz ul Ahsan remarked that a simple media person was not enough qualified to run a media corporation as, besides having an experience of the media, it also requires administrative and financial experience to run the day-to-day affairs.
The chief justice also directed the counsel appearing on behalf of Qasmi to provide the details of their (Qasmi's) academic records to the court.
The attorney general further said that Qasmi was given Rs35.8 million in salary in two years and they were provided with unlimited facilities under the heads of telephone, petrol, entertainment and residence.
Justice Nisar questioned who had approved these perks and privileges for Qasmi and rhetorically commented whether the amount spent on them was taken from a fund for the earthquake affectees?
Later, the attorney general shared the details with the court which stated that Qasmi got the membership of Islamabad Club by paying Rs1.2 million from the public exchequer. At this, the chief justice expressed their extreme displeasure by saying: “We will recover the entire amount paid for Qasmi's club membership with an interest rate of eight percent per annum.”
Federal Information Secretary Sardar Ahmed Nawaz Sukhera and former principal secretary to the prime minister Fawad Hassan Fawad,who were present in the court, were also questioned by the court whether they also have a membership of Islamabad Club.
Both the bureaucrats said that they never took the membership by using the public money but added they pay the membership fee by their own.
The attorney general shared all the details of expenses incurred on Qasmi and payment made by them to other people under different heads including payment to their son Muhammad Yasir Perzada, a grade-20 officer of Inland Revenue services.
Fawad Hassan Fawad informed the court that the prime minister had only approved the appointment of Qasmi as a director in PTV's board and subsequently as its chairperson but the salaries and perks and privileges provided to them were accorded by either the Ministry of Information or the Ministry of Finance.
Justice Nisar questioned if the Ministry of Finance did not approve the salary, was it possible for Qasmi to draw such a hefty amount. Fawad replied that it was not possible without the approval of the Ministry of Finance.
The chief justice also directed in written order to paste court notices on the residence of Dar to make sure their presence in the case.
The chief justice ordered to summon Dar and Waqar Masood in the case by Monday next and suspend the proceedings till today (Wednesday).
Earlier, when Fawad Hassan Fawad showed their ignorance about the approval of the salary package and parks and privileges by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Information, the chief justice remarked that “you could follow my movement but did not know what was going on around you”.
Referring to some unreported conspiracies, the chief justice said: “I know that who was busy to prepare references against me and you were a part of it.”
“These things should not be disclosed here,” the chief justice said adding: “I will not be here after six months but we will have to give something to this country.”
In our world of electronic and digital communications, one wonders what evidence of our day-to-day lives will exist for our descendants in the next century. Modern technology has given us the ability to be in almost constant touch with one another. But, will our emails and texts still exist a hundred years from now? For decades, letter writing was often an everyday occurrence for most people. Keeping in touch meant sitting down with pen and paper. Receiving a letter was often an exciting event, especially from someone miles away. And, for many, including Alexander Graham Bell and their family, these letters were something to be kept, not simply discarded once read. The Bells were profuse writers and as a result, their story can be told today through thousands of letters.
Born in Scotland in 1847, Alexander Graham Bell lived a unique life. Influenced by their father, Melville, a professor of elocution, and their deaf mother, Eliza; the loss of their brothers, Melville and Edward, to Consumption; and marriage to their deaf pupil, Mabel Hubbard, Bell left a legacy to the world that few could imagine living without. How this came to pass is best revealed through the letters between these individuals. Here, we present those letters to you.
...
Having not heard from Aleck in a week, Eliza expressed their anxiety at their lack of correspondence, likely concerned over their recent news that their landlady was in financial trouble, forcing them to think about new accommodation. Family news included Carrie's escort to a ball, the death of Aleck's aunt in Australia and a jilting at the altar.
...
Box 518 P.O Brantford Ont. Dom Can
Home Feb 16th 73
My dear Aleck
I am disappointed that there has been no letter from you this week, being always anxious when there is no news. We hope Mrs. Brown is getting well over their difficulty, and that you will neither be inconvenienced by, nor involved in it.
I told you in my last of Papa's return and of theirs bringing Mr. Bell home with him. The latter left us the day before yesterday, and by this time I suppose they are in Montreal. We all like them very much, and I hope they may be induced to pay us another visit when you are at home in the summer. They escorted Carrie to the ball, and both enjoyed themselves. Singularly enough, not one of Carrie's female acquaintances were there, all or nearly all were unwell. George Ballachey (Carrie heard) is to be married in June to Miss Gilchrist.
We had a letter yesterday from Uncle James, enclosing one they had just received from Uncle Charles at Melbourne. The latter we are grieved to find has lost their wife. He, poor fellow, will be lost himself, and Uncle Edward's almost Motherless girls will feel it too. I believe they were a very excellent woman.
I think you know that my cousin's (Mrs. Bennie) daughter was to have been married on the 24d of Dec., to the son of a rich Spanish merchant, and that they were to accompany their husband to Buenos Ayres. The following is an extract from a letter Uncle James had received from Mrs. Bloomfield.
"You will be shocked to hear, as I am to tell you, that Esther Turner's marriage never came off. We all went to the marriage on the 1st of Dec., everything prepared and they never appeared. You may be sure we all had a dreadful time of it. The story is too long and complicated to enter into on paper, suffice it to say, they are now gone out to see their Father in Buenos Ayres, and is to return they expect and marry them the end of next month. Of course they have confidence in him, none of us have, but time will show. A brother was sent home to stop the marriage, who strangely arrived just the day before. The Father having been led to believe their son was being inveigled into marriage with some low girl! That ought to have been well seen into by Mr. and Mrs. Bennie before the marriage was fixed upon. We all think the affair should have been given up altogether, but it is their business, not ours."
We are very sorry for the poor girl's hurt feelings, but really I am inclined to think it may be to them a blessing in disguise. I cannot think how their Mother could sanction their child's wedding a Spaniard, at all, and (according to the papers) the Yellow Fever is now raging at Buenos Ayres, to such a degree that the young girl would very likely have fallen a victim.
Papa reads at Paris tomorrow evening. The enclosed arrived for you yesterday.
We have just got in a stock of 21 cords of wood, and on Tuesday, Mr. Wye and Mr. Swaisland are coming with a sawing machine, they have got to saw it all up.
Hoping my dear boy that you are well and that we may not be long without the assurance of it I am with dear love from all your affectionate Mother

Martha Stewart has opened up about their five-month stint in prison 13 years ago.
“It was horrifying, and no one, no one, should have to go through that kind of indignity really except for murderers, and there are a few other categories, but no one should have to go through that.” Stewart, 76, told Katie Couric on their self-titled podcast. “It's a very, very awful thing.”
Stewart was sentenced to a minimum security federal prison in West Virginia in 2004 after lying to investigators who were looking into their stock sales.
When asked what made the experience so horrible, the lifestyle guru said, “Being taken away from your family, being maligned, and being treated the way you were treated, it's horrible, especially when one does not feel one deserves such a thing. I was not a bad person.”
Even after all these years, Stewart is still worried their time in prison will be the thing that defines them
“I don't want that to be the major thing of my life. It's just not fair,” they said, adding, “It's not a good experience and it doesn't make you stronger. I was a strong person to start with and thank heavens I was. And I can still hold my head up high and know that I'm fine.”

Prosecutors focused mainly on Wood's use of their patrol car computer, where they found they received a message from a colleague and began typing a response just before the collision. Wood, now 42, had admitted to texting their wife but said it was while they were stopped at a red light, according to a memo by the district attorney's office. Prosecutors concluded the explanation was consistent with cellphone data that recorded minute-by-minute intervals.
LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Bitcoin fell 9 percent on Friday, leaving the best-known cryptocurrency down more than 30 percent this week and headed for its worst weekly performance since April 2013.
The cryptocurrency dropped to as low as $8,155 at 0915 GMT on the Luxembourg-based bitstamp exchange amid a broader rout in the market. Other large cryptocurrencies have lost more than 20 percent of their value in the last 24 hours of trading, according to Coinmarketcap.com.
A growing regulatory backlash against digital coins has sent investors scrambling to sell this week. Bitcoin is down more than half from a December peak of almost $20,000 after it notched up a more than 1,000 gain last year. (Reporting by Tommy Wilkes; Editing by Peter Graff)
Reduce recycling waste contamination by 12 per cent or face stiff fines from Recycle BC.
It's a daunting task for the Regional District of Central Okanagan.
As a contractor to Recycle BC the district must meet their recycling waste contamination parameter of 3 per cent.
The district's current contamination of curbside recycling pick-up is around 15 per cent.
In order to help educate users as to what can and cannot be put in the district's blue bins, they have hired auditors to go bin to bin checking contents.
The auditors leave a note explaining what was found in the bin that is not recyclable, and if the violation is substantial, the bin won't be picked up.

HBO has unveiled a new behind-the-scenes featurette for Game of Thrones Season 7 Episode 5, “Eastwatch”. In this five-minute “Inside the Episode” video, showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss go into more detail on some of the plot points, starting with Daenerys' ultimatum given after the Loot Train Attack. Benioff admits they side with Dany here, while noting that Tyrion's non-violent stance is also admirable. But Benioff does a nice job of making the case for why Dany's decision-making is far different than Cersei's, and it'll be interesting to see if the Lannister soldiers that remain grow to love their new Queen.
The video also dives deep into Littlefinger's scheming. Matt Goldberg wrote an interesting piece a few weeks ago about how Littlefinger's backdealings likely won't work in the current Game of Thrones climate, where everyone's cards are on the table, but that was before Arya showed up at Winterfell and started clashing with their sister Sansa. Indeed, while Game of Thrones fans have been pining to see the Starks reunited for years, the show proves you should be careful what you wish for.
The sweetness of the reunion lasted all but five minutes—these characters have each gone through their own horrors separately, and are now shaped into very different people. Bran isn't really Bran anymore; Arya is a stone-cold killer; and Sansa has aspirations to rule. Littlefinger smartly sniffed out the potential tension between Sansa and Arya and in “Eastwatch” is seen stoking the fire.
Benioff and Weiss also break down Tyrion's plan to get Cersei to help defeat the White Walkers. I'm still not entirely convinced it'll work—even if Cersei comes face to face with a wight, she's not gonna stop trying to murder Tyrion or Dany or anyone else standing in them way.
Check out the behind-the-scenes video below.

MEXICO CITY The United States, Mexico and three Central American nations will this week unveil plans to work with billionaire Carlos Slim's charity to tackle crime in Central America and find new ways of slowing migration, according to a draft document.Top U.S., Mexican and Central American officials meet in Miami on Thursday and Friday to discuss how to cut migration and improve conditions in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, a cluster of poor, violent countries known as the Northern Triangle that most U.S.-bound migrants set out from.The document, seen in Mexico, contains an agenda for the two-day meeting in Miami and lists several specific objectives it refers to as "deliverables." It is a draft document, and could be subject to change.U.S. officials hope Mexico will step up efforts in Central America, especially since President Donald Trump's proposed budget contains deep cuts in U.S. aid to the area.Trump took office vowing to slash illegal immigration to the United States. They have created tensions with Mexico's government with accusations that the country is sending criminals north and a pledge to build a wall along the U.S. southern border.The Miami summit was the brainchild of U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary John Kelly, who will be joined by Vice President Mike Pence. Trump will be in Miami beginning Friday, although not at the same meeting. Instead, they are expected to address future U.S.-Cuba policy.According to a draft document between the United States and Mexico after consultation with Northern Triangle countries, the first day of the meeting will focus on "prosperity", and the second on security.
On the second day, the document mentions a memorandum of understanding between USAID and the Carlos Slim Foundation to "focus on training to support the professionalisation of crime and violence prevention units throughout Central America and enhance economic opportunities for at-risk youth."Consulted on the matter, the charitable arm of Mexican tycoon Slim said it was in talks with USAID, but gave no further details.Slim, one of the world's richest men, is one of the main telecoms providers in Central America, with business interests across various industries throughout the region.Kelly, who previously ran U.S. Southern Command, helped former President Barack Obama design their Alliance for Prosperity, a $750 million initiative that sought to curtail migration with development and gang-fighting projects.
Reuters has reported Kelly aims to retool the Obama-era alliance without a large increase in U.S. funding, by pressing Mexico to take more responsibility for governance and security in Central America, and with more private capital.Trump's 2018 budget proposal envisages slashing U.S. aid to Guatemala by almost 40 percent from 2016, while cutting aid for Honduras and El Salvador nearly a third.Kelly's DHS referred all questions on the document to the State Department, which did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Neither did Mexico's foreign ministry.The foreign ministries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The meeting envisages a commitment to develop a regional migration observatory to slow the flow of Central Americans heading north to the United States."Tracking and collection of data around migratory flows originating from Northern Triangle countries is critical to better develop and direct policy to mitigate illegal migration," the document says.The meeting will include efforts to deepen coordination and professionalise regional crime-fighting and law enforcement, while Washington would reaffirm its support for a free press and independent graft-tackling bodies like Guatemala's CICIG. The United States expects Northern Triangle nations to show "a will to pursue cases that reach political and economic elites," said the document. The "prosperity day" aims to come up with strategies to cut red tape, boost tax revenues in Central America and improve a regional power network, allowing Mexico to sell more electricity to the energy-poor region.Still, a senior Mexico official, speaking on condition of anonymity, feared the Miami meeting would yield few concrete results other than "good intentions."

Teaching may be one of the most rewarding careers there can be. But with the exception of rare films and books that profile inspiring teachers, such as Stand and Deliver, it's a profession that is rarely celebrated — or even necessarily respected.
That's a shame. All societies owe a huge debt to good teachers.
That's why it's such welcome news that the Varkey Foundation is shining a spotlight on teaching to elevate the standing of the profession with a $1-million prize for the best teacher in the world.
And when it comes to great teachers, Canada is clearly no slouch. Among the 50 short-listed teachers from 20,000 international nominees are three Canadians: Armand Doucet of Riverview, N.B.; Yvan Girouard of Lévis, Que., and Maggie MacDonnell, who developed life skills programs for the Kativik School Board in the arctic region of Quebec.
Their teaching methods are inspiring.

The massive amount of snow that fell in the Halifax region Monday is not expected to go anywhere anytime soon, according to the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM).
READ MORE: Closures, cancellations continue in Nova Scotia in wake of blizzard
The municipality said Tuesday that while crews continue to clear snow from roads, it could be several days before every road and sidewalk is passable. But HRM superintendent of winter operations Trevor Harvie said streets are in good condition.
“Overall, I think our streets are in pretty good condition,” Harvie said.
Main streets and transit routes have been cleared, the municipality said in a release, but the clearing of residential streets and sidewalks only started Tuesday morning.
With the amount of snow that fell, the city says the height of snowbanks can be a challenge but crews are working to clear sidewalks and bus stops as soon as possible. However, the release says it could be between 10 to 14 days before all sidewalks in the municipality are cleared.
“Sidewalks right now probably have about four feet of snow on them, huge task, no doubt about it and we'll continue working on them but we'll be delayed compared to normal,” Harvie said.
In an effort to speed up cleaning of residential streets, the overnight winter parking ban is being enforced overnight Tuesday from 1 a.m. until 6 a.m. Two-way traffic may be needed due to widening of streets still being needed. There will also be “targeted snow removal” in some cul-de-sac's beginning Tuesday night.

Harvie said Haligonians can also assist in the process by helping each other.
“The public's been a great help already and the way they can continue to help us out is by helping your neighbour, making sure they have some walkways shoveled, some exits into their house,” Harvie said. “You know, check on your neighbour, make sure they're okay.”
Due to the delay on sidewalks, they also said people can help by grabbing a shovel if possible.
“Anybody that wants to put a little bit of muscle and effort into it, by all means, help us out, we appreciate it.”
Approximately 10 centimetres, with the possibility of more than 15, is expected to fall in the Halifax region Wednesday night into Thursday, according to Environment Canada. With that information in mind, Harvie advised people to keep an eye out for each other on the roads, be cautious, and take your time. They also said pedestrians should wear high-visibility clothing so they can continue to be seen.
Take safety precautions
Halifax's fire department is also urging residents to be careful when they are cleaning up snow.
It's recommended people make sure furnaces are properly piped so carbon monoxide doesn't leak and build up in homes, which could lead to carbon monoxide poisoning.
People are also asked to clear fire hydrants as well, if possible, and make sure every door in a home is usable.
Deputy chief Roy Hollett said people should also stay off roofs when trying to shovel off the white stuff around their home.
“Unless you're trained and have the proper equipment, please don't go on your roof to remove snow,” Hollett said. “Call in a contractor to have them do it. It's safer, it's easier, and there's no risk of you falling off your roof and risking a serious injury or a fatality.”
As several sidewalks remain with snow stacked high, people have started walking on the streets to get around. In response, Halifax police are reminding people to be cautious.

“We normally would tell people not to walk on the street but, in some cases, they have no choice, so just walk towards traffic,” said Const. Dianne Penfound. “If you can, wear high-visibility clothing.”
And with snow expected once more, drivers should take extra precautions and think about having a shovel in their car for emergencies, they added.

The Time's Up push to counter sexual harassment is striking a note with the steeped-in-tradition opera world.
Tenor Michael Fabiano says they “resisted” orders to perform violent scenes. Fabiano — starring at the Metropolitan Opera in “La Bohème” — told the Telegraph of appearing in the violent “Rigoletto”: “In our era now of assault and harassment [of] women I think it's a little in our faces . . . we can be more attentive to what exists in society, even when we create a production that's set 500 years ago.”
Also, a new Italian production of “Carmen” shows the hero shooting their lover rather than being stabbed to death by him, as written by Bizet around 1873.
BOSTON (AP)  A Massachusetts man has pleaded guilty to threatening to burn down New England's largest mosque and making other threats against Muslims.
Patrick Keogan (KEE'-oh-gan), of Wilmington, entered guilty pleas Tuesday to four federal charges, including threatening to injure and intimidate another person and to damage and destroy a building.
Prosecutors say Keogan posted an image depicting a mosque in flames on the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center's Facebook page in 2015 with the message: "Burn your local mosque."
Authorities say they posted the same image on the Islamic Society of Northeastern University's Facebook page and made other statements supporting mosque burning.

Sentencing is scheduled for May 15. Under a plea agreement, prosecutors are recommending a sentence of up to 4 years and 9 months.
Keogan's lawyer declined to comment.
NEW YORK: Saudi Arabia plans to sell shares of Saudi Aramco on a local exchange and may scuttle entirely an earlier plan for an overseas listing, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday (Mar 19).
Aramco had previously discussed an initial public offering in the latter half of 2018 and had been eyeing a listing on New York or another international exchange.
However, the oil giant is now contemplating listing on a domestic stock exchange, viewing the legal risks of listing in New York as considerable, said The Journal, which cited unnamed officials as well as some public comments from top Saudi officials.
The report also said the earliest a listing could take place would be April 2019.
The report comes as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman prepares to meet on Tuesday with President Donald Trump, who has publicly lobbied for a US Aramco listing.
The Aramco IPO had previously been seen as potentially raising US$100 billion, but higher oil prices have helped mitigate the need for additional funds, The Journal said.

The IPO forms the cornerstone of the petro-state's reform program to wean the economy off its reliance on oil revenues.
Until 2014, oil income made up more than 90 per cent of public revenues in Saudi Arabia.
But following a protracted global oil slump, the kingdom is seeking to diversify its economy and privatise some state assets alongside new measures such as a value-added tax.
REUTERS: England coach Eddie Jones has responded to Bath owner Bruce Craig's criticism of their training methods by saying that a high-intensity regimen is required to prepare players for international matches.
Bath prop Beno Obano suffered ligament and hamstring tendon damage in England's training camp at Brighton earlier this month, taking the number of players from the Premiership club injured during Jones' tenure to five.

British media reports had quoted Craig as describing the situation as "totally unacceptable".
"I haven't seen any figures to suggest they are," Jones told BBC Radio 5 live. "No one in our staff has suggested they are but Bruce is obviously an expert on training-ground injuries, so I'll have to be subservient to their greater knowledge."
Worcester centre Ben Te'o was also ruled out of England's three-test tour of South Africa next month after sustaining a thigh muscle injury this week.
The latest injury further cast the spotlight on Jones' training methods.

"The intensity and the speed of the game is far greater in international rugby, and therefore the preparation you have to play test rugby has to be more intense than club rugby," Jones added.
"That doesn't downgrade club rugby at all, it's just a different level of rugby."
Jones said there were still concerns over Billy Vunipola's fitness despite the number eight playing in Saracens' Premiership final win over Exeter last weekend.

Nickelodeon has unveiled the first trailer for Hey Arnold! The Jungle Movie. While it's definitely a nice boost of nostalgia, despite noticeable updates to the voice cast and animation style, the trailer falls into the all-too-common trap of giving away far, far too much of the story. Keep that in mind before taking the plunge.
Co-written and executive produced by the TV series' original creator Craig Bartlett, Hey Arnold!: The Jungle Movie will answer the question of what happened to Arnold's parents. To do this, the movie will take the kids of P.S. 118 on a field trip to the jungle where adventure (and romance) awaits!
It also features original voice cast members Francesca Marie Smith as Helga and Anndi McAfee as Phoebe, alongside dynamic new voice talent Mason Vale Cotton as Arnold and Benjamin “Lil' P-Nut” Flores, Jr. as Gerald. Lane Toran (original voice of Arnold) and Jamil Walker Smith (original voice of Gerald) will supplement the returning cast by lending their voices as Che and Paulo, two members of the boat crew in San Lorenzo, and Alfred Molina stars as resident villain, Lasombra. The movie arrives on Friday, November 24th in primetime over the Thanksgiving holiday.

With the help of two high-profile surrogates, Roy Moore and Doug Jones scrambled Monday to stake their final claims in Alabama's cliffhanger of a U.S. Senate race.
Moore, who largely disappeared from public view after being accused of sexual misconduct, resurfaced for an election eve rally with Stephen K. Bannon, a political advisor to President Trump, in the rural southeast corner of the state.
Trump weighed in with a recorded message pitching the former state Supreme Court chief.
In Midland City, Moore met cheering supporters. “We're Alabama. We're Republican. And we're not going to stand by and let other people from out of state and money from California control this election,” they told them.
Jones stumped in Birmingham and Montgomery, targeting core Democrats but also inviting Republicans to follow the lead of the state's senior GOP senator, Richard C. Shelby, who snubbed Moore by writing in another candidate.
“The people of the state, they have elected Richard Shelby for four decades,” Jones said at a breakfast stop in Birmingham. “They're going to listen to Richard Shelby.”
The race shouldn't be close. Alabama is one of the most conservative states in the country and a boneyard for Democratic ambitions.
In half a dozen U.S. Senate races over the last two decades, no Democrat cracked even 40%. Atty. Gen Jeff Sessions — whose former seat is being filled in Tuesday's special election — faced token opposition in 2014 and won reelection with 97% of the vote.
But Moore's controversial past — they were twice booted from the state Supreme Court for ignoring federal law — and allegations they molested two teenage girls and romantically pursued several others while in their 30s have turned the contest into a coin flip.
Moore, 70, has adamantly denied the allegations and did so again Monday night.
“They got on national television arguing their case after waiting 40 years,” they said, “during which I served in three public offices in the state, I ran five state campaigns, three county campaigns … and never once was this mentioned.”
Along with Bannon, who called a vote for Moore a vote for Trump, the rally featured an appearance by a former Army captain who served with Moore in Vietnam.
Acting as character witness, Bill Staehle said the two once unwittingly were taken to a brothel, where Moore turned on their heels and left. “That was Roy,” the New Jersey attorney said. “Honorable, disciplined, morally straight and highly principled.”
They likened the sexual misconduct charges to “a Viet Cong ambush”
“It's all garbage,” Stahle said.

Apart from the personal drama, the political stakes Tuesday are high.
A Jones victory would cut the Republican's tenuous Senate majority to 51 to 49 and give Democrats a significant boost in their long-shot effort to take control in 2018.
After hesitating, Trump strongly endorsed Moore, appearing at a rally just across the border in Pensacola, Fla., and taping a robocall lashing their political fate to a victory on Tuesday.
“I am stopping illegal immigration and crime. We're building a stronger military and protecting the 2nd Amendment and our pro-life values,” Trump said in the recorded message. “But if Alabama elects liberal Democrat Doug Jones, all of our progress will be stopped cold.”
Former President Obama and their former vice president, Joe Biden, weighed in with their own recorded calls on the Democrat's behalf.
“This one's serious. You can't sit it out,” Obama said in the call. “Doug Jones is a fighter for equality, for progress. Doug will be our champion for justice. So get out and vote, Alabama.”
Obama could be especially helpful in motivating African Americans to vote for Jones — and against Moore, who has questioned whether the nation's first black president was born in the United States.
But the endorsement is not necessarily an unalloyed benefit. Jones, 63, a former federal prosecutor and Alabama native, has pointedly kept their distance from national Democrats, who are generally held in low regard in this Deep South state.
“The only robocall I know about for sure is the one from my wife,” Jones said.
They capped their day with a Birmingham get-out-the-vote rally featuring former NBA star and Alabama basketball legend Charles Barkley.
“At some point,” Barkley said, “we got to stop looking like idiots to the nation.”

Bunnell High School graduates were advised during commencement to live their lives so they wouldn't have regrets later on.
“Do everything in your power to avoid having to look back on your life in 40 or 50 years and regretting what you wish you had done but never did,” said 2017 valedictorian Joseph M. Pellegrino.
“We can be anybody and aspire to anything at which we're willing to work,” they said.
Pellegrino joined 233 other classmates in receiving their diplomas on Wednesday evening at Bunnell, cheered on by their families, friends and school staff. The ceremony took place under beautiful blue skies.
Pellegrino plans to study economics and mathematics at Harvard University next year. They hope to eventually work in the financial field.
Salutatorian Lawrence Lam wondered how the four years of high school had gone so quickly. “High school is short and sweet, but it is just the tip of the iceberg,” they said of what awaits them.
Lam, who will study computer science engineering at the University of Connecticut, told classmates it's up to each of them to execute their plan for the future to the best of their abilities.
Bunnell Principal Nancy Dowling called the group of graduates “an amazing, impressive class.” They said all students had worked hard to better themselves and the community, leaving a positive mark.
“Remember, in life, the only thing you can control is yourself,” Dowling said. “Strive to simply be good people and leave the world a little better than how you found it.”
The ceremony took place at the Bunnell football field, with attendees packing the bleachers and showing their excitement with cheers and an occasionally horn blast. Many brought along flowers, balloons and stuffed animals to present the graduates as congratulatory gifts.
Graduate from Olivia Sage said they were excited to receive their diploma. She's looking forward to beginning classes at Central Connecticut State University to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering. “It's a good field for women to be in these days,” they said.
Fellow graduate Abbas Harris will study engineering at UConn. “It was a good, long journey and all my hard work has prepared me for college,” they said of their high school years.
Pedro and Katiana Figueroa, parents of Melissa Escobar Avilez, were proud of their daughter's achievement. “She's an excellent kid,” said their father, noting they will attend college and hopes to become a doctor.
This was the 57th graduating class at Bunnell. During the ceremony, invited members of the BHS Class of 1967 were recognized while marking the milestone of their 50th reunion. “Thank you for the Bunnell High School traditions you helped found,” Dowling said.

SNL found viral success with their Totino's spoof ads that dropped during previous Super Bowls over the past couple of years. And there's sure to be another one tonight with host Natalie Portman.
Mean Jeans takes their love for the delicious cheese covered cardboard to the next level, offering a Tim and Eric inspired song that will definitely get stuck in your head. Tim and Eric actually got paid for their Totino's commercials, though.
Mean Jeans isn't ripping off Tim and Eric, as some might be quick to accuse them of. They actually have an entire album of product placement jingles that is part comedy gold, part true punk rock. And it's all just a little bit crazy.
Mean Jeans hail from Portland, Oregon. Their new LP is literally 23 unsolicited jingles for 'the sickest companies and products' that no one asked for. The band has songs for Coors Light, Mountain Dew, and Camel cigarettes. And every one of them will get stuck in your head. Enjoy their first single, with the new record out on February 16 from Fat Wreck Chords, home of Fat Mike.
Colombo: The Maldivian Opposition Saturday accused President Abdulla Yameen of resisting local and international pressure to comply with a landmark Supreme Court order to free nine political prisoners.
The Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) said Yameen was yet to release any in line with Thursday's shock decision of the apex court to quash the dissidents' convictions.
"Although Yameen has said they will abide by the ruling, they are yet to comply with the order delivered more than 36 hours ago," Colombo-based MDP spokesperson Hamid Abdul Ghafoor said on Saturday morning.
The court on Thursday night said that cases against the nine dissidents, including former president Mohamed Nasheed, were politically motivated and asked the government to release them immediately.
It also ordered the reinstatement of 12 legislators who were expelled for defecting, and effectively gave the Opposition a majority in the 85-member assembly.
In a statement issued overnight, the joint Opposition, which includes Nasheed's MDP, said it feared the regime would ignore the release order and that it would trigger further unrest in the nation of 3,40,000 Sunni Muslims.
" We are deeply fearful that the government's refusal to implement the Supreme Court order could escalate to unrest and incite violence across the country," the joint Opposition said.
Nasheed, the country's first democratically elected president, has urged the government to respect the top court's decision.
The United Nations, Australia, Britain, Canada, India and the United States welcomed the court's decision as a move towards restoring democracy in the politically troubled Indian Ocean nation.
Earlier, Nasheed had said the ruling cleared the way for them to return to the Maldives and contest elections due later this year.
"I can contest and will contest," they told AFP in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo.
For its part, the Maldivian government announced Friday that it had concerns about releasing those who had been convicted of "terrorism, corruption, embezzlement, and treason".
Yameen's office said Attorney General Mohamed Anil had raised the administration's concerns with the chief justice.
Nasheed was barred from contesting any election in the Maldives after a controversial 2015 terrorism conviction internationally criticised as politically motivated.
The Maldives' popular image as an upmarket holiday paradise has been severely damaged by a major crackdown on dissent under Yameen, who has overseen the jailing of almost all their political opponents.
The Opposition said there were sporadic clashes Friday night between anti-government activists and the police in the Maldives.

The political leader of Yemen's Houthi rebels has been killed in Saudi-led air strikes on Hudaida province, the group has said.
The Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV network reported on Monday that Saleh al-Sammad, the president of the Supreme Political Council that runs Yemen's capital, Sanaa, and other rebel-held areas, was killed on Thursday.
The group said it had elected Mahdi al-Mashat as Sammad's successor.
In a televised address later on Monday, the Houthis' leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, said that, overall, seven people were killed in Thursday's air raids.
“This crime will not break the will of our people and state … [and]will not pass without accountability,” they added.
“The forces of this aggression led by Washington and the Saudi regime are legally responsible for such a crime and all its implications.”
There was no immediate comment by the Saudi-led coalition.
Traditionally based in Yemen's northwest, the Houthis overran much of the country, including Sanaa, in 2014, citing anger with the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
In March 2015, a coalition of Arab countries assembled by Saudi Arabia launched a massive bombing campaign aimed at rolling back the rebels' advances.
Since then, the Saudis have carried out more than 16,000 air raids, resulting in mass civilian casualties with weddings, hospitals and funerals targeted. The United States has been helping the coalition with weaponry and logistical support.
On Sunday, two Saudi-led coalition air attacks killed at least 20 people and wounded dozens in northwestern Yemen, according to residents and medical personnel.
Most of the dead were women and children who were gathering in a tent set up for a wedding party in Hajjah's Bani Qays district, a medical official told Al Jazeera.
‘Biggest blow'
Hakim Almasmari, editor-in-chief of the Yemen Post, said al-Sammad's death was a “very significant” development.
“He was the acting president in the Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, so this is considered the biggest blow for the Houthis, politically, since the war started,” they told Al Jazeera.
Almasmari noted that the location of the incident was also important.
“Hudaida is considered the most secure place for the Houthis, where they have all their intelligence,” they said.
“This is a big backlash for the Houthis, security-wise as well,” they added.
“It's not a secret that Hudeida is much more secured than even Sanaa itself, so for them to be killed in Hudeidah, under all the extreme security measures that they go through there, [raises questions]whether they are infiltrated in Hudeida province itself or within the intelligence apparatus in general.”
Almasmari also said it was not surprising that al-Sammad's had been replaced by al-Mashat, whom they described as “a very influential figure within the movement”.

SEATTLE (AP)  An American Indian tribe in northwestern Washington is suing the federal government, saying it has wrongfully been denied nearly $14 million in a flap over its efforts to kick out almost 300 members.
In November, following a years-long fight that included some unusual legal maneuvers by the Nooksack Tribe, the tribe's chairperson announced that the 289 members had been booted because they had insufficient Indian blood. They said they shouldn't be entitled to tribal rights or benefits, which can include housing, health care and educational support.
Those purportedly kicked out have been fighting to remain, however, and the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs has refused to recognize the expulsions because four tribal council members  half the council  had remained in office after their terms expired and no election was held to replace them.
In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle on Monday, the 2,000-member tribe  or at least the remnants of its council  argued that the government's decision interferes with its right to govern itself. Due to the bureau's decision, the tribe has been denied $13.7 million in state and federal grants for medical services, housing and salmon habitat restoration, among other things, the complaint alleged.

"The composition of the Nooksack Tribal governing body is a matter of internal tribal concern and an inherent and exclusive power held by the Tribe," the lawsuit said. "Federal interference over matters of internal tribal concern is generally prohibited."
The controversy over the tribe's membership has featured the tribal council disbarring an attorney for the people facing expulsion, and then firing a tribal judge who invalidated that maneuver. After a tribal appeals court ruled against the council, the council created a tribal supreme court  and appointed three of their own members as justices.
After claiming to have completed the disenrollment, the tribe, based 80 miles north of Seattle, held new council elections last month, and now says it has seven tribal council members  enough for a quorum.
But the federal government has declined to recognize any actions taken by the council since last spring, when the four-year terms of four council members expired. Because no elections were held then, the ensuing decisions were illegitimate, the government said.
The complaint argued that Nooksack law allows for council members to remain after their terms expire.
In October, the Department of Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs began warning that the tribe's federal funding was at risk. The government is required to ensure that federal trust funds are spent in connection with "duly authorized" tribal councils, wrote Lawrence S. Roberts, principal deputy assistant secretary for Indian affairs.
In their most recent letter, in December, they warned that if the tribe didn't hold legitimate elections by March 31, the bureau would take over providing services to tribal members directly  including to those purportedly kicked out. They also warned that tribal police should not try to evict them from tribal housing, or the bureau would also take over policing on the reservation.
The bureau did not return a phone message seeking comment on the lawsuit, which seeks to recover from the federal government grants that the feds and Washington state are withholding. Washington state is not named as a defendant. It's not clear how the tribe could recover from the feds money Washington is withholding; a lawyer for the tribe did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
Gabriel Galanda, a lawyer for those facing disenrollment, called the lawsuit "a transparent ploy by the holdover council to cling to power."
"They don't even have standing to bring the suit on behalf of 'the tribe,'" they said. "They stopped being 'the tribe' when they refused to have an election last March."

A 62-year-old Hazleton man has been tentatively identified as the person found deceased in a stretch of Hazle Township woods Saturday morning.
Luzerne County Deputy Coroner Jeff Stock said family identified the man as David R. Goldsworthy of East Mine Street.
Goldsworthy died of natural causes, Stock said, and due to their state of decomposition, it was determined that they had been deceased for “an extended period of time.”
An autopsy will not be performed, they said.
State police at Hazleton who are investigating said Saturday the death did not seem suspicious.
A man walking a foot path made the discovery and called Luzerne County 911 to report the finding around 9 a.m. Saturday, summoning troopers to a trail near Vine and 24th streets not far from several residences.
The man was found about 50 feet from the trail, according to the man who made the finding while walking through the woods, but declined to give theirs name.
Goldsworthy was reported missing Sept. 11 after last being seen on Sept. 7, according to a Hazleton police press release issued last month seeking information on theirs whereabouts.
They were wearing a blue baseball cap with the words “Las Vegas” on the back and a green, hooded Eagles jacket with the team's logo embroidered in silver across the front, according to that report.
Goldsworthy was also wearing blue jeans and gray sneakers with “Z” on the side of each shoe, police said at that time.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday asked Congress to extend martial law on the southern island of Mindanao for a year, arguing that Islamist militants have been regrouping since a five-month urban conflict ended there in October.
MANILA: Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday asked Congress to extend martial law on the southern island of Mindanao for a year, arguing that Islamist militants have been regrouping since a five-month urban conflict ended there in October.
They said fighters who survived the battle for Marawi City were determined to establish a Southeast Asian 'wilayat' – or governorate - for Islamic State and named militant Abu Turaifie as potentially the radical group's next regional "emir".
The previous "emir", Isnilon Hapilon, and another rebel commander loyal to Islamic State were killed in October as the military closed in on fighters who had occupied the heart of Marawi since May 23.
More than 1,100 people - mostly militants - were killed and 350,000 displaced by the Marawi unrest.
In their letter to the Senate and House of Representatives, Duterte said militants were radicalising and recruiting local people, reorganising themselves and building their finances.
"These activities are geared towards the conduct of intensified atrocities and armed public uprisings," they said, adding that they were aimed at establishing a global Islamic caliphate and a 'wilayat', not only in the Philippines but the whole of Southeast Asia.

A group led by Turaifie - who heads a splinter group of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters and, according to Duterte, is "said to be Hapilon's potential successor" - was planning bombings in the Cotabato province south of Marawi.
Intelligence reports indicate that militants are plotting to attack another city, Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said on Monday.
Duterte placed restive Mindanao, which has a population of 22 million, under military rule after the attack on Marawi, and martial law was due to be lifted there on Dec. 31.
Lawmakers will vote on their request for a one-year extension at a joint session on Wednesday, Congress majority leader Rodolfo Farinas told reporters.
Continuing martial law beyond the initial 60-day limit requires lawmakers' approval, but the constitution does not limit any extensions.
Martial law allows for tougher surveillance and arrests without warrant, giving security forces greater rein to go after suspected extremist financiers and facilitators.
Duterte has long warned that Mindanao faced contamination by Islamic State, and experts say Muslim parts of the predominantly Catholic southern Philippines are fertile ground for expansion, due to their history of marginalisation and neglect.
Critics of Duterte, who has held open the possibility of extending military rule to the whole country, have slammed the imposition of martial law in Mindanao as a misuse of power and evidence of the president's authoritarian tendencies.
Martial law is a sensitive issue in the Philippines, bringing back memories of the 1970s rule of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who was accused of exaggerating security threats to justify harsh measures to suppress dissent.
Human rights group Karapatan questioned why martial law should be extended in Mindanao nearly two months after the military's victory in Marawi City.
"This is a dangerous precedent that inches the entire country closer to a nationwide declaration of martial rule," it said in a statement.

We stand because those who fought and died for our freedom cannot stand anymore. We honor them by standing as Christ stood at the passing of Stephen in Acts 7:56. There is something special and honorable about the heroism of a person that agrees ahead of time to give their lives for you -- it's unexplainable. The only correct response is standing. It's not enough, but it's the best tradition we have to show honor.
We place our hand on our heart to feel it beat. Reminding us that many stood and volunteered to give their last heart beat, their only precious life, to protect and defend our freedom. We cover our heart to remind us that the enemies of America will not stop until they extinguish the collective heartbeat of America - patriotism. However different we are, our enemies see us as the same heartbeat.
We cover our heart with our right hand because it is the traditional hand of covenant, oath and thanksgiving. Reminding us that the patriots who fought to protect our freedoms, started their journey by raising their right hand into the air and pledging their life in honor to protect America and its people. Our right hand, because when we see them again we will extend the right hand of thanksgiving, shake their hand and thank them for their service, whether it's here on Earth or in heaven.
We sing the words, even if we cannot sing well, because our speech has creative power; it binds us to the past and protects our future freedom. Singing the anthem renews patriotism and deflates our differences. We are reminded that when a battle is lost or a country falls to an enemy, the first ceremony is removal of the losing flag and the hoisting of the enemy flag. The enemies' removal of the flag is a universal sign of victory. The words of our anthem penetrate the heart of our enemy and remind them that we are a force that has been battle-tested and has persevered. After a vicious, all night battle, at the dawn's first light, the flag was still there. That scene has been repeated over and over during America's lifetime. Brave men and women of all races, creeds and colors putting it all on the line to win the battle and keep the colors flying.
While we don't have an anthem for every heroic battle in our history, the "Star Spangled Banner" reminds us that every right, privilege and freedom we have today was secured and is being secured and will be secured in the future in a battle on a battlefield by a warrior that agreed ahead of time to give their lives, if necessary. It is one of history's great mysteries that an American citizen would give up their individual freedoms and their life to expand the freedoms of citizens they don't know. Yet that mystery binds us all together.
The best tradition to bring unity in our great nation is to stand with right hand over your heart and sing the anthem that honors every race, creed and color or patriot that gave their lives. These patriots are the reason we can answer the anthems great question with a resounding "YES!"
"Oh say does that Star-Spangled Banner yet (continue to) wave over the land of the free and the home of the brave?"
Let us not be the last generation to answer the anthem's great question with a "yes."
Senator Ryan Gatti

Incidents of political violence including an assault on one candidate and an attack on the office of another are casting a shadow over Lebanon's first general election in nine years.
BEIRUT: Incidents of political violence including an assault on one candidate and an attack on the office of another are casting a shadow over Lebanon's first general election in nine years.
The May 6 vote will take place using a complicated new electoral law. It is not expected to cause major changes to the government or its policies. Analysts expect Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri will head the next cabinet.
But the law has made the outcome less predictable in some places. This has sharpened local rivalries and is encouraging parties to campaign extra hard.
"The threats to candidates, men and women, are escalating. We expect more of them as we approach the election, and we expect an increase in violence," said Omar Kabboul, the executive director of the Lebanese Association for Democratic Elections (LADE), a group of independent electoral observers.
"The outcome of the elections is uncertain. The more uncertain the outcome, the more fear there is within the parties and the bigger the agitation in speeches."
Some 28 years after Lebanon's civil war, nobody expects any major strife, but the country has been plagued by repeated bouts of political instability that have weighed on its economy.

The Lebanese system divides up power according to strict sectarian quotas, with parliament's 128 seats split evenly between Christian and Muslim groups. The flare-ups reported so far have pitted rivals from the same sect against each other.
The army intervened on Sunday night to break up a confrontation between supporters of rival Druze parties south of Beirut in which guns were fired in the air, a security source said. The standoff spiralled from a row over electoral posters.
Also on Sunday, an independent Shi'ite candidate said Hezbollah supporters beat them up in their southern Lebanon stronghold, where they are standing against the two dominant Shi'ite parties Hezbollah and Amal.
Ali al-Amin said a group of more than 30 Hezbollah supporters accosted them while they were hanging an election poster in their home village of Shaqra in Bint Jbeil district.
"I accuse... a political side, which is Hezbollah, of arranging this incident and I hold it mainly responsible," they said, adding that the group "could not tolerate the presence of one photo or poster of a candidate who is against them".
Ali Saleh, the pro-Hezbollah head of the local council, said it was an "individual incident" that was now in the hands of the judiciary and security forces. "Ali al-Amine is a candidate ... and every candidate has the right to practice their media campaign and their electoral campaign," they said.
CONFRONTATION
The heavily armed, Iran-backed Hezbollah, which gained legitimacy among many Shi'ites by fighting Israeli forces that occupied the south until 2000, has taken part in Lebanese elections since the early 1990s, enjoying an effective duopoly of the Shi'ite vote with Amal.
The parliamentary election has been postponed three times, chiefly because Lebanon's fractious politicians could not agree on the new election law that was demanded by Christian parties.
It has redrawn constituency boundaries and introduced a new proportional representation system that experts say has been engineered to suit the dominant political players but has still left a good deal of uncertainty at the local level.
Last week, supporters of Hariri's Future Movement attacked the offices of an electoral rival in the capital, breaking their windows, the rival candidate said.
First, their election posters were torn down, then their supporters were attacked after a rally, and then their campaign office was assaulted, prompting some volunteers to quit, said Nabil Badr.
Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk, a Future Movement member, acknowledged on television that some of the party's supporters had carried out the attack. They said they had been provoked by Badr's bodyguards, who had themselves assaulted a local figure.
"All the parties are tense because they don't know the outcome of this electoral law," said Badr. "The electoral battle will be strong in Beirut."

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Torrential rain battered Nepal on Sunday, causing widespread flooding and landslides and raising the death toll from three days of severe weather to 49 people, according to officials.
The toll could go higher than three dozen people were reported missing. Another 17 were injured.
The heavy rain, which mainly hit the country's southern plains, led to the evacuation of 5,000 people, a Home Ministry official said.
More than 30 people were reported dead on Saturday.
Army and police personnnel continued search and rescue operations, with more than 34,000 houses submerged, the official added.
"The number of dead could increase as we are still compiling the final tally," said Laxmi Pun, an aide to Home Minister Janardan Sharma, told Reuters.
The Red Cross estimated 100,000 people were affected by the disaster, with one official describing how the storm had cut off communication and electricity, adding to the challenges in rescuing people and distributing aid supplies such as food and water to displaced people.
Monsoon rains which start in June and continue through September are important for farm-dependent Nepal, but they also cause havoc each year.
The other night at Karaoke, two of my friends got up to do a killer rendition of "Wannabe" by the Spice Girls. They were excellent, especially after a glass or three of Pinot Grigio, but honestly it just made me nostalgic for the originals. Made me long for the days of Girl Power, belly tops, running pants and Union Jack bodysuits. But I figured you can't go back in time... happily, I was wrong. Because the Spice Girls are officially back, proving friendship really doesn't ever end.
The original Spice Girls, Victoria Beckham, Geri Haliwell, Emma Bunton, Melanie Brown and Melanie Chisholm, haven't performed together since the closing ceremonies of the 2012 Olympic Games in London, England. Before that, the pop group formed by manager Simon Fuller in 1996 hadn't been together properly since 2002 when they broke up and made every girl cry themselves to sleep forever. That's an incredibly long time to go drifting through life without girl power, guys, and it's been a struggle. It's hard to find your inner diva when Posh Spice, Ginger Spice, Baby Spice, Sporty Spice, and Scary Spice just turned back into regular people. The ladies were great on their own, of course, but honestly they need to be together doing joyful, choreographed dancing to give a scope of the full extent of their magic.
And it looks like we might not have to wait much longer for this to be our new reality.
Cristian Iglesias on YouTube
For years, all seemed lost. There were the odd rumors that the Spice Girls might get back together (although Victoria Beckham generally seemed to be something of a hold out); there was even a rumor that three of the original five members might form a spin-off group called GEM (for Geri, Emma, and Mel C.), but that never came to fruition.
But suddenly, the clouds lifted and out came the sun. The five women sat down together at Geri Horner's (formerly Haliwell) home for a "little catch up," as Mel C. told BBC Radio 2:
It's the worst kept secret in showbiz always. It was lovely to get together, so we are talking about opportunities, ideas we have for the future... but you know, it's early stages and there's nothing set in stone, there is no big announcement.
After the five women sat down together, with former manager Simon Fuller on tow, they released a joint statement that really spiced up my life:
We have enjoyed a wonderful afternoon catching-up and reminiscing about the amazing times we have spent together. We are always overwhelmed by how much interest there is across the whole world for the Spice Girls. The time now feels right to explore some incredibly opportunities together. We all agree that there are many exciting possibilities that will once again embrace the original essence of the Spice Girls, while enforcing our message of female empowerment for future generations.
So that's the good news, everyone. They're looking into opportunities. The slightly bad news is that no one has shared what sort of opportunities they might be looking into. If it matters to anyone in the world, I would like to put my vote on for:
World Tour Reunion
A Spice World movie sequel
new music
merchandise made for mature women who want to be a part of Girl Power
We'll have to wait and see what the Spice Girls are planning to come up with to reignite the brilliant flame that was Girl Power. For now, it's simply enough to rejoice in the knowledge that yes, history can miraculously repeat itself if we wish hard enough
Yesterday, Universal Pictures yanked Bride of Frankenstein from its February 14, 2019 release date and off its release schedule entirely, which lead some to speculate that the studio's nascent Dark Universe is already in big trouble. Now we have word that Angelina Jolie, who has been rumored for some time as the title character but never officially confirmed, may be backing away from the project, but if they do, director Bill Condon reportedly wants to bring on Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) to take their place. While nothing is official quite yet, it could mark quite the interesting development for this project, and the Dark Universe as a whole.
Shortly before the release of the first FR59n8qk1MWA87|+Dark Universe movie, The Mummy, Universal released a photo featuring The Mummy stars Tom Cruise (Nick Morton), Sofia Boutella (Ahmanet) and Russell Crowe (Dr. Henry Jekyl) but it also confirmed Javier Bardem as Frankenstein's monster in Bride of Frankenstein, and Johnny Depp as the title character in The Invisible Man. This new report from The Wrap claims that Javier Bardem's deal isn't finalized, and neither was Angelina Jolie's deal either. The report claims that the project has been in a "holding pattern," as director Bill Condon and the studio keep waiting to see whether or not Angelina Jolie will sign on or drop out of the project. Here's what an unidentified insider had to say about the project.
"This is fairly out of nowhere given how deep they were into prep over there, but not really surprising. Their mandate has more or less been that they wanted these to work as PG-rated action movies/theme-park rides, not horror movies. Basically, Fast and the Furious meets The Avengers, but with super monsters."
Another source stated they were surprised Universal is still moving forward with their Dark Universe, given how The Mummy flopped at the box office, which we reported in late June could result in losses of $95 million, despite a strong box office showing overseas. Still, it seems the studio is moving forward with this Dark Universe, which The Mummy helped set the table for. The entire universe will revolve around the mysterious corporation Prodigium, run by Dr. Henry Jekyl that has a mission to protect the world from supernatural creatures and beings. Director Bill Condon stated in an interview this week that they are not worried at all about how their movie connects to the Dark Universe, he's only concerned with making a great monster movie. Here's what the filmmaker had to say about the script that was written by David Koepp (Jurassic Park), which is much different than the original 1935 classic, directed by James Whale.
"What I love about David Koepp's script is they turn everything on its head. This is Eve before Adam, the bride comes first. So in its own way, you know, we all know the Bride only exists for 10 minutes in the Whale movie; she's there and the movie's over. So I keep thinking [it's], in a way, at least a tribute to what Whale might have done if he'd made a third Frankenstein movie and he'd done it in the 21st Century. I think there are just things about the sensibility of that movie. Also their genius in solving that basic problem you still see when people approach monster movies now, which are you've got to create a monster that you're afraid of, that you're terrified of, but you can still identify with, and that line was never walked better than by James Whale."
As for Gal Gadot, their reps wouldn't comment on the story, and there is no indication of whether or not they would be interested in taking on this iconic role. The actor is most certainly in demand, after starring in Warner Bros.' first DCEU hit, Wonder Woman, which became the highest-grossing movie of the summer, and they will next be seen reprising that heroic role next month when Justice League hits theaters. Gal Gadot will almost certainly come back for the Justice League sequel, and Warner Bros. already set a December 13, 2019 release date for Wonder Woman 2. Since Bride of Frankenstein has already been pushed out of its 2019 date, it's possible that Gal Gadot could fit this into their schedule after making the Justice League sequel and Wonder Woman 2, that is, if she's even interested in the role. This report from The Wrap has not yet been confirmed, so hopefully we'll find out more soon.
Jammu: Two Pakistani soldiers were killed in fierce retaliation by Indian troops as Pakistan Army on Wednesday violated ceasefire thrice along the Line of Control (LoC) in two sectors in Rajouri and Poonch districts of Jammu and Kashmir.
The Pakistan Army resorted to shelling of mortar bombs and firing of small arms and automatic weapons on forward posts and civilians areas in the region.
There have been 10 ceasefire violations in past four days and total 14 ceasefire violations along the LoC and the International Border in Jammu region since 1 January, in which one civilian died and seven others were injured.
In escalated terror violence in Kashmir, militants engineered seven grenade attacks and firing incidents in the Valley on Tuesday in which 14 police officers were injured and four rifles snatched by militants from the.
Indian troops gave a strong retaliation in which 2 Pakistani soldiers were killed opposite to Bhimbher Gali sector on Wednesday, defence sources said.
"Pakistan Army initiated indiscriminate firing of mortars, small arms, automatics RPG, Recoilless Rifles from 6.40 pm in Naushera sector along the LoC in Rajouri district on Wednesday," Defence Spokesman Lt. Col. Manish Mehta said.
Before this third ceasefire violation in the day, the Pakistan Army initiated indiscriminate firing of small arms, automatics RPG, Recoilless Rifles from 9.30 am in Naushera sector along the LoC in Rajouri district on Wednesday, they said.
Indian Army posts are retaliating strongly and effectively and firing is presently on, they said.
Earlier, Pakistan carried out indiscriminate firing from 5.00 am to 5.45 am in Bhimbher Gali sector in Poonch along the LoC, they added.
There were 3 ceasefire violation on 12 June.
The Marvel Cinematic Universe is currently in upheaval after the events of Infinity War, which has also left behind a huge mystery. While we know that most of the characters that turned to dust with the snap of Thanos' fingers will return, it isn't clear who will return or even how at this point. However, Drax the Destroyer actor Dave Bautista has confirmed that their character will be back for Avengers 4 and Guardians of the Galaxy 3.
Drax, along with Mantis, Star-Lord, Peter Parker, and Doctor Strange were all wiped out on Titan after Thanos completed their journey, leaving Tony Stark and Nebula alone. Though they don't know how it will happen, Dave Bautista has revealed that Drax will be back for Avengers 4 as well as Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 in a new interview. Bautista says that they have to come back after friends and family contacted them after watching Infinity War. They explain.
"I got a lot of texts saying, I can't believe you're dead, your character is dead. They were really like heartbroken and I was like I'm gonna be in four. I'm gonna be in Guardians 3. I don't know how they're bringing me back, yeah but somehow I'm going to make it because, as far as I know, I am going to be in Guardians 3, so I have to be back."
Infinity War's bleak ending left behind a trail of questions, but the leading one is always about Peter Parker, T'Challa, and the Guardians, who all have sequels coming up in the MCU. Spider-Man: Homecoming 2 is officially starting production this summer, so we know that Peter Parker will be brought back somehow. Black Panther 2 has pretty much been confirmed and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 has an official release date.
The main question for Avengers 4 will be how everybody makes it back after turning to dust. There are many theories floating around the internet that involve a parallel universe, the Soul Stone, time travel, and the Quantum Realm. It could be a combination of a few of these choices, but it is unclear at this time how everything will go down. But, time travel seems like it will have to factor in somehow and the Quantum Realm will be discussed much further in the upcoming Ant-Man 2, which hits theaters in a few weeks.
Along with Dave Bautista's Drax coming back, we have seen Zoe Saldana's Gamora on the set of Avengers 4 along with some of the other members of the Guardians crew. James Gunn has said that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 will be the last of the trilogy to feature the original characters, but some might not make it out of Infinity War and Avengers 4 alive. The waiting game continues, but at least we know that there will be a healthy dose of comedy now that it's confirmed that Drax will be back in Avengers 4. You can read the original interview with Dave Bautista at Collider.

Is your yard ready for spring and free of wildlife attractants?
The WildSafeBC Kimberley-Cranbrook program has started for the 2018 season, and Community Coordinator Danica Roussy is back for their third year.  They are once again available o help with any human-wildlife conflict questions or challenges.
The first item on Roussy's agenda is educating the public about springtime attractant management methods.
“With the warmer weather and longer days, local bears are beginning to stir from hibernation,” said Roussy. “Bear activity in the region will steadily increase over the coming weeks as the animals head to lower elevation valley bottoms in search of early spring vegetation. Let's start the season off on the right foot by ensuring there are no wildlife attractants accessible on your property before bears or other wildlife have a chance to find them.”
Roussy explains that proactive management is the single best way to prevent conflict and keep neighbourhoods safe. The following is a checklist to get your yard ready for the season:
* Is your garbage securely stored? All garbage should be locked in a secure building until the morning of collection.
* Have you taken down your bird feeders? Pack away your bird feeders for the season and clean up any spilled seed.
* Is your compost pile ready for the spring? Turn your pile well and incorporate new material slowly and with plenty of ‘browns' to ensure speedy decomposition.
* Are there any other attractants accessible to wildlife? Securely store attractants like recycling bins, pet food, gasoline/diesel canisters and fertilizers indoors.
* If you have livestock, are your electric fences working optimally? Is your livestock feed stored securely?
For more information or to ask questions, contact Roussy at kimberley@wildsafebc.com or 250.908.8101.
If you are in need of advice or assistance for an immediate conflict with wildlife call the RAPP line at 1-877-952-7277.

PARIS-Serena Williams made a winning return to Grand Slam tennis which was as memorable as their body-hugging black catsuit when they reached the Roland Garros second round on Tuesday.
The 36-year-old downed Kristyna Pliskova of the Czech Republic 7-6 (7/4), 6-4 to register their first victory at the majors since their 2017 Australian Open triumph. "I missed Roland Garros so much, I missed the battle," Williams, the 2002, 2013 and 2015 champion, said after playing their first clay court match since finishing runner-up to Garbine Muguruza in the 2016 final on the same Philippe Chatrier Court. "It's been two years since I played here. It wasn't easy but I have been training really hard. I feel good and just so happy to be back here."
As Williams -- and their eye-catching outfit -- grabbed the headlines, there were wins but a few scares for 10-time champion Rafael Nadal and two-time winner Maria Sharapova. Nadal racked up their 80th win in Paris by seeing off Italian lucky loser Simone Bolelli 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (11/9).
Sharapova, playing the tournament for the first time in three years after missing 2016 through a doping ban and last year when they were refused a wildcard, battled from a 0-3 deficit in the final set to beat Dutch qualifier Richel Hogenkamp 6-1, 4-6, 6-3.
Williams, the winner of an Open era record 23 Grand Slam titles, had arrived at Roland Garros with just four matches under their belt in 2018, the last of which was in Miami in March. Having been off the tour to give birth to daughter Alexis Olympia Ohanian in September, many in the sport wondered if they would still be a contender at the majors especially with their ranking at 451.
However, they gave a stinging response to the doubters on Tuesday even if their win over the 70th-ranked Pliskova tested the American. Arriving on Philippe Chatrier Court in a black catsuit, offset with a pinkish-red waistband, Williams trailed 0/3 in the first-set tiebreaker.
The three-time champion champion then fell 0-2 behind in the second set and was forced to retrieve another break to level at 4-4. As they served for the match, they even slipped into the net, righting themselves sporting an embarrassed smile.
They saved three break points in an eight-minute-plus 10th game before taking victory, setting up a second-round clash with Australia's Ashleigh Barty. The only consolation for Pliskova, the twin sister of world number six Karolina, was finishing with 15 aces, the most hit against Williams since such records began to be kept in 2008.
World number one Nadal had been two sets up but 0-3 down in the third to Bolelli when rain caused the tie to be suspended late Monday. They quickly levelled at 3-3 on Tuesday, saved four break points in the eighth game before saving four set points in the breaker.
The top seed eventually claimed victory on a third match point when Bolelli dumped a forehand into the net. Nadal, bidding for an 11th title in Paris and their 17th major, next faces Argentina's Guido Pella for a place in the last 32.
"I really suffered today but it was a good test," said Nadal who had been in danger of dropping their first set at Roland Garros since their 2015 quarter-final loss to Novak Djokovic.
Sharapova also survived a serious scare to claim a 6-1, 4-6, 6-3 victory over Hogenkamp, ranked 133. Sharapova, the 28th seed, will face Croatia's Donna Vekic in the second round.
"I love the challenge of being in a Grand Slam draw and figuring out a way to win," Sharapova said after a match that was pushed back from Monday due to thunderstorms.
The 31-year-old, five-time major champion, took just 24 minutes to win the first set of a match which was delayed from Monday due to thunderstorms, but threw away a 3-1 lead in the second. Sharapova was staring down the barrel of falling at first hurdle in a Grand Slam tournament for the first time since the 2010 Australian Open when trailing 3-0 in the third, but the former world number one dug deep and reeled off six straight games to edge into round two.
The Russian, who was Paris champion in 2012 and 2014, fired 35 winners in their victory on Court Suzanne Lenglen. Third seed Marin Cilic reached the second round with a 6-3, 7-5, 7-6 (7/4) win over Australia's James Duckworth.
Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov eased to a 7-5, 6-4, 6-2 victory over Australian John Millman in their first ever main-draw French Open match. Third seed and 2016 champion Garbine Muguruza defeated 2009 winner Svetlana Kuznetsova 7-6 (7/0), 6-2. World number one Simona Halep, twice a runner-up, had their opener against Alison Riske, the 83rd-ranked American, put back to Wednesday.

Five big ideas of Modi govt's Budget 2018 that look way beyond next election and might well be irreversible
Ahmedabad: A group of war veterans on Monday accused the Narendra Modi government of "betraying" their trust over the issue of the One Rank One Pension (OROP).
They claimed that instead of agreeing to their demands for which the ex-servicemen had been agitating for long, the Centre was "insulting" them.
The war veterans said the government was doing "injustice" by capping at Rs 10,000 per month the educational assistance it gives to children of martyrs or those disabled in action.
"By not implementing OROP, the Modi government has betrayed our trust," said Major General (retired) Satbir Singh, chairperson of the Indian Ex-Servicemen Movement.
During a press conference at the state Congress headquarters in Ahmedabad, Singh maintained their movement was "apolitical" and they had requested the opposition party to raise their grievances in Parliament and also before the public.
The Modi government "insulted" ex-servicemen and their widows by arresting them and suppressing their protest using police, they alleged.
"It has become a hallmark of the Modi government to suppress opposition voice. We would like to ask the BJP government at the Centre as to why it did not accept OROP in the form it was accepted by the then UPA government on 17 February, 2014?" they asked.
The UPA government had agreed to the definition of OROP which said that servicemen who worked for the same duration and retired on the same rank will be given an equal pension, irrespective of their date of retirement, they said.
"Why the Modi government did not accept OROP in the form accepted by the UPA government based on the theory of equality, thus denying benefits to ex-servicemen?" they asked.
"The Modi government denied benefits of OROP to 40 percent of the armed forces personnel and those who retired early, according to a notification issued on 7 November, 2015," the retired officer said.
They raised questions over the Modi government putting the condition in the scheme that it will review pensions after five years when experts sought a review after two years.
"Why is injustice being meted out to the children of martyrs by limiting their education expenses at Rs 10,000 per month?" Singh asked.
They were referring to a Centre's notification dated 13 September, 2017, capping education expenses for the kids of martyrs or those disabled in action at Rs 10,000 a month.
In November 2015, the Centre issued a notification, bringing into force the long-pending OROP scheme, which it said, will benefit over 2.5 million veterans and war widows.
However, the ex-servicemen had then rejected the notification, saying their main demands have not been accepted.
In December 2015, the government appointed a committee to look into the anomalies, if any, arising out of the implementation of the scheme. The panel later submitted its report to the defence ministry.

Western Cape Social Development MEC Albert Fritz says their near death experience will push them to do more for impoverished and vulnerable youth in the province. Speaking to VOC Breakfast Beat on Monday, Fritz relayed their harrowing experience being caught in a gun battle in Nyanga on Saturday morning, when they were accosted by an armed robber. One of the suspected robbers was killed and another seriously wounded after the minister's security personnel opened fire. A by-stander was also injured in the crossfire.
“It creates in me a greater resolve to do more for our youth in providing opportunities for young people. They don't need to take crime as an option in their lives. We really need to work hard to up people to a better level of social security,” they told VOC.
The MEC was in a car waiting to speak at a youth event when a man approached the vehicle and demanded their body guard hand over their cell phones. The shooting unfolded at around 9:40am outside the Assembly of God Church on Zwelitsha Drive, Nyanga.
“Suddenly a person came with a gun and pointed the gun at one of my protectors demanding their cell phone. In the meantime another one which they call a grabber in robbery language, [the grabber]then took the phone off my media person while my media person was speaking to someone about when they [the youth]are arriving,” Fritz related.
“Then my protector threw their phone away to distract the guy [robber]and when they were distracted, it gave my protector time to take their gun out. There was shooting to and fro and it was just a mad house. I was just lying flat on the back seat of the car.”
During the fierce gunfight, Fritz spokesperson Sihle Ngobese then pulled the Minister from the car, which was in the direct line of fire, and evacuated them into their own car. They then fled the scene to the Nyanga police station.
Fritz said the incident is a sign of lawlessness in the area and why Nyanga is known as the “murder capital” in South Africa. When asked whether the robbery was politically motivated or sheer criminality, Fritz said crime was a normal thing in the area and was “opportunism”.
“That morning just before us they robbed four women from their cell phone. The afternoon at 3pm another man was robbed and stabbed to death about 20 meters away from where we were robbed,” explained Fritz.
Fritz's protectors are reported to be recovering well after receiving treatment for trauma after the incident. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) is investigating the incident. VOC

: India's top energy company may have compromised the lives and safety of its employees and its actions may have resulted in the exchequer incurring losses, an investigative report byhas found.Documents accessed by the television news channel revealed that Oil and Natural Gas Corporation of India (ONGC) has been flouting its own norms by refurbishing its old cranes, instead of replacing them.According to the 'Maharatna' company's norms, the lifespan of a crane is 20 years, after which they have to be replaced. They should also be replaced if the price of refurbishment exceeds 75 percent of the cost price of a new crane.However, ONGC has decided to refurbish as many as 21 cranes, 18 of which are over 20 years old, despite the cost of repairing each one coming close to that of a new crane.The role of these cranes on offshore oil platforms cannot be over-emphasised. Because space becomes a vital constraint on these platforms, cranes are used to move containers between the work site and the storage area. Whether it is to bring in food, water or equipment, cranes play a vital role.It all started on March 24, 2017, when ONGC invited tender for 27 cranes. Once the tender was invited, an anonymous written complaint was made by one Mujib Naithani, which said three deck cranes that were a part of the tender process were already recommended for replacement by the ONGC Executive Purchase Committee on October 17, 2008.Paying heed to the complaint, ONGC decided to cut its requirement and invite tender for only 24 cranes, for which it issued a fresh tender November 9, 2017. Naithani, however, filed another complaint at this point, saying three more deck cranes that were a part of the tender process were already recommended for replacement by the ONGC Executive Purchase Committee on October 17, 2008. This led to the final tally of cranes being brought down to 21.According to ONGC's 'Equipment Replacement Policy for Offshore Equipments', cranes must be replaced after 20 years, but they can also be replaced if the cost of repairs on any single occasion exceeds 75 percent of the replacement cost.In a meeting in 2007, it was found out that out of the 45 cranes ONGC had, 28 cranes were already over 20 years old and 9 others were over 18. However, considering the lead time for availability of new cranes would be over three years, it was contemplated that the option of replacing the cranes may not be feasible, since revamping them would take lesser time and would add to their life by approximately 15 years.On March 7 this year, the company invited tender for the refurbishment of 21 cranes, 18 of which are over 20 years old now. Of the 18, 11 are actually over 25 years old.According to the documents available with CNN-News18, an Indian company called G&T Oilfield and Offshore Services had submitted a proposal to replace the cranes at a price of USD 870,000 apiece. The cost of repair for at least 10 of the cranes that are being refurbished exceeds 75 percent of the quoted amount. In some cases, it is almost as much as the price of a new crane.The price quoted by the Sparrow group for refurbishment was between Rs 4.00 crore and Rs 5.60 crore apiece, depending on the capacity of the crane.The contract to repair these 21 cranes was given to a company called Sparrows Offshore Group, which is a part of a service contractor group called Energy Cranes International (along with Aberdeen Hydraulics and Baricon Systems). ONGC had kept Energy Cranes out of its approved vendor list.This raises several questions about the conduct of ONGC: Why has the company decided to break all its norms to award a contract for refurbishment? Is there a hint of a scam here? Why has ONGC kept mum on the detailed questionnaire sent byfor over two weeks?

Sam Allardyce has identified Tuesday's home showdown with Swansea as being crucial to Crystal Palace's hopes of surviving in the Premier League.
Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Arsenal left Allardyce's new club in 17th place and with a total of only 16 points from 19 games.
Swansea are widely expected to appoint a new manager of their own by Tuesday evening, but Allardyce is wary of the need to win if Palace are to climb clear of the bottom three.
They have already complained that Swansea have had an additional day's preparation for this fixture, and to that end made second-half changes at Arsenal to protect three of their players.
They were convincingly outplayed at the Emirates, but Allardyce is adamant any points taken from the division's top six can only be considered a "bonus" because it is results secured against those club around them which will define their season.
"Our players need to get ready for Swansea on Tuesday night - that's the big game they need to win," said Allardyce.
"Watching Premier League football this year, the top six are so much better than last year so it's always hard to pick up points against them.
"Our big game's on Tuesday, there's no doubt about it. We're going to survive by beating teams in the bottom half.
"If we get a victory against one of the top boys that'll be the added bonus to get us safe quicker.
"It's been so long since Palace have gone on an extended run of good results."
Christian Benteke, Andros Townsend and Yohan Cabaye were the three players Allardyce substituted at Arsenal and each is expected to retain their place against Swansea.
The manager also has Damien Delaney available again after suspension, and could consider changes after speaking of their disappointment at their performance at the Emirates.
On Sunday Palace were as poor as they were at any stage under Allardyce's predecessor Alan Pardew, but asked if they have found the job more difficult than they expected, they responded: "Not really.
"It's only two games.
"I'll know by the end of the window (how difficult a task survival is). Two things have to happen for the team to get better and produce results.
"Get the team fitter - getting the injured players back - and try and buy players in. Two if possible, three if the finances will allow. I want to lift the squad.
"I can lift the squad by the way we train and organise ourselves, and we can lift the squad by bringing a couple of good players in to lift it. If you get the right players you can lift those already here.
"Because they haven't won so many games in the whole of 2016, they're a little bit low on confidence - that you have to try and build up."

To cap off a wonderful fall of avian anecdotes and bird facts, let's explore how humans have utilized bird morphology to increase the efficiency of modern-day technology. The science and art of mimicking biological structures and functions to solve technical problems, known as biomimicry, is used across scientific fields, ranging from glue derived from the threads blue mussels used to attach themselves to rocks to birds being used as models for airplanes.
Leonardo da Vinci spearheaded the beginning of avian biomimicry back in the 15th century (woah). They were particularly interested in studying our winged friends in an attempt to enable human flight, something they unfortunately are unable to achieve during their lifetime. However, their early work provided the necessary foundation for the Wright brothers, who successfully designed and operated a plane in the first years of the 20th century. Nowadays, airplanes, while lacking the beauty of birds, do share similar morphological characteristics that support flight such as tapered wings (blunt in the front and tapering in the back which causes rise). The long take-offs required for these massive aerial machines were inspired by arguably the best flyer in the avian world: the albatross. These pelagic (sea-dwelling) birds boast over 8-foot wing spans, and spend most of the year flying at sea, only landing during the breeding season when it's time to get it on for a month or so. Given their relatively big size, albatrosses must run and flap for a substantial distance before they get enough lift to fly — just like an airplane!
The bullet trains of Japan owe their wind-breaking speeds to birds as well. For years, bullet trains emitted a booming, loud noise upon leaving tunnels due to the build-up of air along the nose of the train. In constant search for a solution to this problem, designers turned to the kingfisher for inspiration. Kingfishers, as their name suggests, spend their days on perches above bodies of water, searching for unlucky fish that scurry helplessly below. These elite fish-killers have evolved a dagger-like bill that allows them to pierce the water at such a speed that offers their scaly victims no chance for survival. By altering the blunt nose of bullet trains into one that closely resembled that of kingfishers, engineers effectively reduced the booming noise emitted by bullet trains. Thanks, birds!
On the subject of noise, many aircraft and wind-turbine engineers are currently investigating ways to reduce the sound emitted by these machines, and have recently turned to owls for the answer. Owls are renowned for their ability to hunt silently, which comes as a result of intricate flight feathers lined with downy (really soft and light) material. These specialized feathers allow them to fly at fast speeds while remaining undetected by the oblivious moles in the grasses below, which they then tear to pieces for dinner. The question for engineers now is how to replicate and synthesize these specialized feathers in such a way that they both reduce noise emissions from machines while maintaining their functionality. Good luck.
Love,
Henry
PETALING JAYA – It was not only a union between the scions of two business empires but also a marriage of two cultures.
Newlyweds S.M. Faliq Nasimuddin and Chryseis Tan exemplified the latter by wholeheartedly embracing Malay and Chinese wedding traditions.
Brother to the groom SM Nasarudin SM Nasimuddin, who is Naza joint group executive chairperson, shared photos of the “gate-crashing” games when the groom and their band of brothers (Heng Dai or best men) picked up the bride at The Chateau in Bukit Tinggi, Bentong.
Traditionally during Chinese weddings, the bride's maids of honour set up a series of challenges for the groom and their Heng Dai to accomplish before they are allowed to take the bride to the groom's tea ceremony.
In the photos, Faliq looked dashing in a luxurious maroon red samfu (traditional Chinese men's wear) while the groomsmen donned matching outfits in royal blue.
They arrived at the bride's venue in a Mercedes-Benz G63 AMG holding red Chinese fans and were photographed laughing as they played gate-crashing games, one of which required them to pass apples among each other using only their mouths.
Blushing bride Tan wore a gold and red qunkua (traditional wedding dress) while their team of 10 bridesmaids wore beautifully embroidered beige cheongsam.
“We didn't say no to any challenge that was presented to us by the Ji Mui (bridesmaids),” SM Nasaruddin said, adding that they saved lots on the ang pow (red packets containing money).
The heirs of business empires Naza Group and Berjaya Group tied the knot in an intimate ceremony on Friday (Feb 2).
They were said to be friends when studying at an international school and reportedly got engaged on July 2 last year when the 33-year-old Faliq proposed to Tan, 30, while they were on vacation in Marrakesh, Morocco.
The wedding photos uploaded by Faliq's younger sister Nadia Nasimmudin on their Instagram also showed the couple being pronounced husband and wife after an akad nikah (solemnisation of marriage) ceremony with a RM1,000 dowries.

Researchers warned Tuesday of a "troubling" accumulation of microplastics in sea ice floating in the Arctic ocean, a major potential source of water pollution as global warming melts the sheets of frozen water.
A team from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) found 17 different plastic types in ice samples gathered during three Arctic expeditions on board the research icebreaker Polarstern in 2014 and 2015.
They included plastic from shopping bags and food packaging, from ship paint, fishing nets, nylon and polyester found in synthetic fabrics, and cigarette filters.
One sample contained the highest concentration of microplastics ever found in sea ice -- up to 12,000 particles per litre of frozen water.
This was two- to three times higher than any past measurement, the research team wrote in the journal Nature Communications.
The discovery suggests microplastics "are now ubiquitous within the surface waters of the world's ocean," sea ice physicist Jeremy Wilkinson of the British Antarctic Survey said in a comment on the study.
"Nowhere is immune," they said via the Science Media Centre in London.
Sea ice grows from the freezing of seawater directly underneath the existing ice, thus incorporating floating microplastics as it grows downward, they explained.
This means the plastics were present as the ice was growing, and drifting, in the Arctic Ocean.
Of particular concern was the particles' small size.
Some were only 11 micrometers across -- about a sixth the diameter of a human hair, the team said. A micrometer is a millionth of a meter.
This "means they could easily be ingested by Arctic micro-organisms" such as small crustaceans on which fish feed," said study coauthor Ilka Peeken, an AWI biologist.
What's the harm?
"No-one can say for certain how harmful these tiny plastic particles are for marine life, or ultimately also for human beings," they said.
Micro-plastics are less than five millimeters (0,2 inches) long, about the size of a sesame seed.
They come in the form of "micro-beads" used in face scrubs and toothpaste, or are created when larger pieces are degraded by the Sun, temperature changes, mechanic abrasion, or ocean wave action.
The contribution of microplastics to the headache of ocean pollution is unclear.
According to environmental group WWF, 8.8 million tonnes of plastic enters the oceans every year, the equivalent of a garbage truck dumping a full load every minute.
On current trends, warns the UN, there will be more plastic than fish in the sea by 2050.
For the study, Peeken and a team used a spectrometer to bombard the ice cores with infrared light. They analyzed the radiation reflected by the plastic pieces to determine their likely origins.
Samples from the Canada Basin, fed by water from the northeast Pacific via the Bering Strait, were high in polyethylene used in packaging material, leading the authors to conclude these particles came mainly from the so-called Great Pacific Garbage Patch -- a swirling plastic dump in the ocean now bigger than France, Germany and Spain combined.
Others were rich in particles from paint and varnish used on ships, while nylon bits from fish nets were "found frequently in almost all sea ice cores."
"Fisheries accounts for a major share of the ship traffic in the Arctic Ocean and continuous reduction of sea ice is assumed to increase fisheries further, particularly in the high Arctic," wrote the team.
The sea ice binds the particles for between two and 11 years, said the researchers.
This is the time it takes for the sheets to travel southward from the seas of Siberia and the North American Arctic to the Fram Strait between Greenland and Norway, where they melt while new ones are formed in the north -- a cycle accelerated by global warming.
"The melting of multi-year sea ice exacerbated by climate change could reasonably lead to the release into the water column of large amounts of plastics stored in the Arctic sea ice cover," Newcastle University oceanographer Miguel Angel Morales Maqueda said in another comment.
What happens to it then, is unclear -- do the particles remain in the Arctic, are they transported to waters further south, or do they sink?
Other studies have recently warned that humans are ingesting microplastics in shellfish, tap water and bottled water.
The health risks remain unclear.
Over 200 people have been contaminated or infected with a potentially deadly strain of drug-resistant fungus during outbreaks at UK hospitals.
Some 20 separate NHS Trusts and independent hospitals detected Candida auris (C. auris) in patients, with three hospitals being forced to tackle "large" outbreaks of the pathogen that is "difficult to control".
First discovered in Japan, the family of yeasts can live on the skin and inside the body, causing complications in people with weakened immune systems.
Public Health England (PHE) said doctors at one hospital were still dealing with an outbreak of the fungus, which is resistant to a commonly prescribed fungicidal drug.
Medical staff have been issued with new guidance on detecting and dealing with the fungus, including the "intensive" disinfection of wards amid concern over the "increasing experience of the complexities" infections are posing.
Meanwhile a biosafety unit at Porton Down, the UK's chemical weapons lab, has been testing fungicidal activity of a variety of disinfectants and antiseptics.
"As at the beginning of July 2017, 20 separate NHS Trusts and independent hospitals in the United Kingdom had detected over 200 patients colonised or infected with C. auris," PHE said.
"Three hospitals have seen large nosocomial (within hospital) outbreaks that have proved difficult to control, despite intensive infection prevention and control measures, though two of these outbreaks have been declared over and one is seeing significantly fewer numbers of new acquisitions.
"Over 35 other hospitals have had patients known to be colonised with C. auris transferred to them."
PHE said there was no evidence that any of the infections had resulted in the death of a patient in the UK, although there were limitations to the data available.
Official guidance states that infections are usually minor, while serious infections are rare.
PHE said most cases detected in the UK have been of colonised patients, while around a quarter of cases have been clinical infections - including 27 patients who developed blood stream infections.
Complications arise when the fungus enters the body or blood stream during medical treatment, such as the insertion of drips of urinary catheters, or a wound.
C. auris is resistant to the first-line antifungal drug fluconazole and the species can rapidly evolve to develop resistance.
The fungus was first identified in the ear of a patient in Japan in 2009 and has since caused prolonged hospital outbreaks in India, Pakistan, Venezuela, and Colombia.
A probe has been launched after a Sunderland man and their wife were found dead in Cambodia.
The couple, who have not been officially named, are believed to have been found at a guest house in Sihanoukville on New Year's Eve.
Police in Cambodia are investigating the deaths and the Foreign Office has been informed.
The man is understood to be in their mid-30s.
The woman is understood to originally be from London and in their late-20s.
A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson said: “We are in contact with local authorities following the deaths of two British Nationals in Cambodia and are ready to support their families at this extremely difficult time.”
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in its meeting on Wednesday approved an increase the minimum support price (MSP) for Kharif crops as a move to fulfil its Budget promise and address farmers' concerns about the cost of crops.The CCEA has approved a rise in MSP for paddy by approximately Rs 250 per quintal to Rs 1,800 per quintal to honour the Budget announcement to ensure that farmers get at least 1.5 times of the production cost. Earlier, the prices were at Rs 1,550 per quintal.The cost of the revised MSP is estimated to be around Rs 33,500 crore.Minimum support price is a form of market intervention by the government to insure farmers against any sudden fall in agricultural produce prices. The MSP is a guaranteed price for their produce from the State.Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that the Union Cabinet will approve the increase in MSP to at least 1.5 times of the production cost in the forthcoming meeting.Paddy is the main Kharif crop, the sowing of which has already begun with the onset of the southwest monsoon.“In some of the Kharif crops where the MSP is already 1.5 times of the production cost, the increase will be minimal. But there will a sharp increase in crops like paddy, ragi and moong, whose MSP are well below the 150 percent of the input cost,” an official source had said prior to the meeting.The MSP will largely apply to paddy and pulses but will benefit ‘nutri-cereals' like millets the most. The added cost of MSP is 0.2 percent of GDP, according to the Cabinet note. The share of paddy in the additional outgo will be around Rs 12,300 crore.A range of crops was covered by the latest MSP, unlike the usual focus on rice and wheat. A procurement mechanism is to be announced later. The highest priority, in calculating the cost of production, has been given to labour, which is about 53 percent while other costs like fertilisers, farm animals, pesticides, seeds and irrigation make up the remaining.According to a report in The Economic Times, the government has delayed the announcement of MSP of kharif crops, the sowing of which has already begun, as it was weighing whether to take such a big political decision considering the huge financial burden on the exchequer.Farm experts are of the view that the sharp increase in the paddy MSP could further boost India's rice production, which touched an all-time high of 111 million tonnes in 2017-18 crop year and the output is much more than the domestic demand.The cultivation of paddy, which is a water-guzzling crop, needs to be discouraged and not promoted, they said, adding that higher rice production will lead to increase in government procurement and swelling of the food subsidy bill.This hike assumes significance given that it covers the crop which constitutes over 50 per cent of the total acreage of food grain crops during Kharif season.This move is expected to put an additional burden of an estimated Rs 12,000 crore on account of procurement based on records of procurement in previous years.During the announcement of the Budget in February 2018, Arun Jaitley had said that the insurance of MSPs of Kharif crops at 1.5 times their costs will be based on the A2+FL costs, and not the more ambitious C2 costs formula favoured by farm scientist MS Swaminathan.The A2+FL formula takes into account actual cost plus the imputed value of family labour in the production of a crop. But the C2 formula factors in a lot of costs, including imputed rent on land and interest on capital, which makes the cost of production much higher.The move comes as a way to address farmers' distress as major nationwide protests with various demands have taken place this year.
Turkey's Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım arrived in Spain yesterday for an official visit during which they will take part in the 6th Turkey-Spain Intergovernmental Summit.
The official visit comes following an invitation by Yıldırım's Spanish counterpart. Yildirim was welcomed by Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy with an official ceremony at the Moncloa Palace in Madrid.
During their visit, the prime minister will be accompanied by Environment and Urbanization Minister Mehmet Özhaseki, Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci, Food, Agriculture and Livestock Minister Ahmet Eşref Fakıbaba, Transportation, Maritime Affairs and Communications Minister Ahmet Arslan, Deputy Foreign Minister Ahmet Yildiz and Deputy Internal Affairs Minister Mehmet Ersoy.
Apart from meeting Rajoy, Yıldırım is also expected to meet Congress of Deputies President Ana Pastor and King Felipe VI. Speaking at a news conference in the capital Ankara ahead of their visit, the premier said both sides would focus on bilateral relations and regional and international issues during their visit.
The premier said they would also meet the Turkish and Spanish business community to boost economic ties.  They are also expected to attend the Nueva Economia Forum, which is considered an important reference point for politicians, the business world, diplomats and the press.
They said Turkey's bilateral trade with Spain increased by 19 percent in 2017, reaching around $13 billion while hundreds of Spanish companies were investing in Turkey.
"We take this visit very seriously to further our relations with Spain and we will sign some agreements," Yıldırım added.

MIAMI (AP) Authorities say a stowaway on a flight from the Dominican Republic to Miami was spotted emerging from the plane's wheel well and sent back home.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson Mike Silva said Monday the man was a Dominican national.
Silva said Miami-Dade Police spotted them exiting the wheel well after American Airlines flight 1026 from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, landed Saturday at Miami International Airport.
Police detained the man, whose name wasn't released. Silva said they were medically cleared, processed as a stowaway by federal authorities and returned to the Dominican Republic.
Silva said local and federal authorities searched the plane and cleared it to resume normal operations.
Airline spokesperson Ross Feinstein said the airline was reviewing the incident with Las Americas International Airport officials.
The effectiveness of a dam depends on how it is operated.
It is not constructed well if it stores water when there is a shortage of it already and if it collects flood water that goes to waste all the while providing water in times of a shortage, it is well thought out.
In our case a very high percentage of flow in the rivers takes place in the three months when the occurrence of floods is great.
Under the Water Accord of 1991, the federal body, Indus River System Authority (IRSA), determines when the dams are to be filled and when water is to be released from the dams.
IRSA has warned of a 25 percent shortage for the irrigation of crops due to reduced storage in the dams.
The shortages will keep on increasing until more storage capacity is added to the system by building a dam.
Sindh has three votes in IRSA against only one vote for Punjab.
ENGR KHUSHID ANWER,
Lahore, November 12.
On a bitterly cold night in January 1941, French composer Olivier Messiaen debuted a new work.
It was an unusual premiere. Messiaen's audience was an assembly of war prisoners and their guards. The concert hall was an unheated barrack in a Nazi prison camp near the Polish-German border where Messiaen, who had served in the French Army, was being held as a prisoner himself.
The composition, “Quartet for the End of Time,” was a piece of chamber music in eight movements inspired by themes of the apocalypse as described in the Revelation of St. John in the Christian Bible. The musicians played an unusual combination of instruments: piano, cello, violin and clarinet. These were the only ones available to the composer during their roughly two years in detention. At that first recital, Messiaen played the piano. Fellow POWs rounded out the rest of the ensemble.
Los Angeles artist Susan Silton can't quite remember when they first stumbled onto Messiaen's legendary work, which New Yorker music critic Alex Ross describes as the “most ethereally beautiful music of the 20th century.”
Perhaps it was on the radio, perhaps a music streaming service. What they know is that it was in the wake of last fall's U.S. presidential election — and their reaction to the work's dissonant piano chords and siren clarinet notes was immediate.
“It created this visceral response,” they say. “I put on this piece and it made me weep … I didn't know its history when I cried. Then I researched it and I find out its incredible history.”
They were so moved, that they are now staging “Quartet for the End of Time” for an experimental production on Friday and Saturday in downtown Los Angeles.
Their interest was in collapsing time into the infinite. That's what they meant by the ‘end of time.' — Susan Silton, artist

As a prologue, actor Cristina Frias will read a text inspired by the writings of Hannah Arendt. A dance component has been developed by independent choreographer Flora Wiegmann, known for their spare approach to movement. All of this will unfold on two stages separated by a scrim through which musicians and dancers will travel back and forth in space and time.
“The miracle of the quartet,” wrote Times critic Mark Swed in 2008, “in which bird song is used to represent freedom and gloriously colored harmonies the glory of infinity, is its transcendence of time and space.”
Messiaen, who died in 1992, regularly toyed with ideas about time, doing away with traditional meters and the development of themes.
“His interest was in collapsing time into the infinite,” Silton says. “That's what they meant by the ‘end of time.'”
“Some of the movements are so slow that time really seems to stop — it's kind of suspended,” says Silton's collaborator Vicki Ray, a Grammy-nominated pianist and a founding member of Piano Spheres, a group that promotes the creation and performance of major new piano compositions. “He's really trying to evoke this sense of time completely stopping.”
It has some of the most rapturously beautiful music ever written in the cello solos and the violin solos. — Vicki Ray, pianist

The presentation will take place not at a concert hall, but in a bare industrial warehouse in the Arts District — one whose functional brick-and-concrete architecture better evokes the chilliness of Stalag VIIIA, where Messiaen was held.
It's a space, says Silton, “that has this sense of oppressiveness inside.”
Perhaps most interestingly: The production will consist entirely of women.
“I wanted it to be in stark contrast to what the original context was,” says Silton. “Between how it was first presented according to Messiaen, with male POWs and played by men … and how I felt I wanted the work to be.”
Part of their desire to produce the piece with women was prompted by the election. “I always want to insist on our presence,” they say, “but in the shadow of this president, I believe it's even more critical that we insist, and persist.”
The performance is part of a series of new site-specific pieces for downtown Los Angeles organized by the arts nonprofit Los Angeles Nomadic Division. In addition to Silton's performance, the series, titled “Exchange Value,” also includes upcoming works by Los Angeles artist Olga Koumoundouros, artist and filmmaker Alison O'Daniel and the duo of Iván Navarro and Courtney Smith.
Shamim Momin, the director of LAND, as the organization is known, says they were immediately drawn to Silton's project.
“It was this idea of coerced beauty, how we can be forced into this creative process,” they say, “this opportunity to explore problematic themes and things that can give you insight.”
Silton is an artist whose work incorporates many forms, including photography and printmaking. In the latter case, they produce optical art-inspired works that toy with human perception.
They also regularly stages performances. In 2013, they gathered a circle of volunteers at USC's Fisher Museum for a collective re-typing of John Steinbeck's “The Grapes of Wrath.” Last year, they created a public opera, “A Sublime Madness in the Soul,” that could be viewed from the now-demolished 6th Street Bridge in downtown Los Angeles.
For Messiaen's “Quartet for the End of Time,” they were intrigued by what the work represented and found themselves wanting to work with it — even though they are not a musician herself.
“The perseverance of the spirit, of the artistic spirit,” they say. “I was struck by the range of emotion from one movement to the next. Some movements are extremely angst-ridden and angry — and not so much assaultive, but reflective of passion and oppression. Others are extremely quiet and poignant and accepting.”
Its message, and the story of the conditions under which it was made, felt especially poignant to them in this fractured political time. “I felt so vividly that the piece reaches all of those emotions that I'm feeling in this present moment.”
So they reached out to Ray, whom they had once seen perform a work by Morton Feldman at LAXART. To them surprise, the pianist — who has played “Quartet for the End of Time” on more than half a dozen occasions over their career — immediately signed on, compelled by the music, which they describe as “landmark.”
Touted as India's first space odyssey, Chanda Mama Door Ke directed by Sanjay Puran Singh Chauhan, is based on a team of astronauts whose mission brings the country together.
Sushant Singh Rajput who recently returned to the country after intensively training at NASA's Space & Rocket Centre at Alabama, is all set to step into the shoes of an astronaut for their next .While they are known to go all out for their characters, the actor is really pushing it with this role flooring both the special effects team of the film and officials from USSRC.
Said international Special Effects Director, John Palmer” Sushant is the most physically dynamic actor I have worked with. Sean said that if they could have had Sushant another day, they would have certified them as an instructor. Realize that all the stars in Apollo 13 took the same training in the same tank.Pat Ammons , The Communication Director at USSRC said that they wished they have a signature wall of stars because they would have had Sushant sign it along with Tom Hanks,Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Senesce and Ron Howard.Sushant was that good and not only is they extremely intelligent but kind,cautious and friendly to the folks there. They made a lasting impression on all the folks at USSRC”.
The actor underwent a special training schedule at USSRC that included regimes such as, ‘Flying a Space Shuttle Simulator' or ‘Lunar Module/Mars Lander Simulation', ‘Experiencing Zero G', ‘1/6', ‘Wearing a professional Space Suit', ‘Flying a multi-axis trainer' and ‘Docking the shuttle to the ISS.”Apart from that the actor trained in the neutral buoyancy lab , had long discussions with astronauts and rocket scientists and even experienced upto 4 Gs in Centrifuge, which astronauts actually feel in Saturn 5 rockets going on the moon.
The Trump administration is rolling back the Obama-era requirement that employer-provided health insurance policies cover birth control methods at no cost to women.
According to senior officials with the Department of Health and Human Services, the goal of the new rule is to allow any company or nonprofit group to exclude the coverage for contraception if it has a religious or moral objection.
"This provides an exemption, and it's a limited one," said Roger Severino, director of the HHS Office of Civil Rights. "We should have space for organizations to live out their religious identity and not face discrimination."
They said they expect that most companies will continue to provide coverage for birth control and that the changes will only affect a tiny percentage of U.S. women. The new rules are being published Friday in the Federal Register and go into effect immediately.
But some health policy analysts say the new rule creates a huge opening that lets any employer claim an exemption, leaving their female workers to pay the full cost of any birth control out of pocket.
"It is a huge loophole for any employer that does not want to provide birth control coverage to their employees," says Dania Palanker, a professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reform.
The change fulfills a promise President Trump made in May to the Catholic religious order The Little Sisters of the Poor in a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. The nuns had sued the Obama administration over the birth control requirement.
The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, requires employer-provided health insurance policies to include coverage for preventive health care. After the law passed, HHS used its regulatory authority to specify what has to be included in those preventive services and birth control, including "all Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity."
But the policy was controversial from the start.
Several companies and religious groups sued, saying the rule infringed on their religious freedom.
The Obama administration created an exemption for churches and allowed other "religious employers" to opt out by notifying the government. When they did so, the administration would arrange with their insurance companies to provide the coverage directly, without the employers' involvement.
But the Little Sisters of the Poor weren't happy with that workaround and sued.
The group's case, and a second one involving private businesses including the Hobby Lobby chain of craft stores, which has 32,000 employees, went to the Supreme Court.
The court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby in 2014, saying privately held companies could object on religious grounds. And then, last year, the court issued a split ruling in the Little Sisters case, saying the government shouldn't fine the nuns but ordering the two sides to work out an arrangement that accommodates their religious beliefs.
Before a deal was reached, Trump became president.
At the Rose Garden ceremony in May, they told the Little Sisters of the Poor that they planned to change the rules. "Your long ordeal will soon be over," they promised.
Under the new rule, women who work for Hobby Lobby or the religious group may no longer have access to birth control coverage through the Obama-era workaround. A Hobby Lobby spokesperson said the company would have no comment on Friday, and the Little Sisters of the Poor didn't respond to NPR's emails seeking comment.
Hobby Lobby's founder and CEO David Green told reporters in 2013, "Our family is now being forced to choose between following the laws of the land that we love or maintaining the religious beliefs that have made our business successful and have supported our family and thousands of our employees and their families."
HHS officials said they don't expect many companies to seek waivers. They said the group seeking waivers will likely be limited to those about 200 companies and nonprofits that have already sued.
But Palanker says the impact could be a lot bigger. There are a lot of large private companies, they say, whose owners may hold strong religious beliefs but did not want the publicity and expense of suing the federal government.
"A lot of women will retain birth control coverage," Palanker says, "but there will be a lot of women who will lose that coverage."
That means they'll find themselves paying out of pocket. A one-month supply of birth control pills can cost anywhere from $4 to $55 or more, according to GoodRX.com.
Longer-acting contraception, like an intrauterine device, can cost more than $1,000, says Sarah Lipton-Lubet, a vice president at the National Partnership for Women and Families. They say the new rule is a tool for discrimination against women.
"Women shouldn't be denied access to basic health care based on their employers' religious beliefs," they say. "We all have the right to our religious beliefs. But the way that this rule treats religion is really an excuse to discriminate."
HHS officials say they also plan more stringent enforcement of a provision in the Affordable Care Act that prohibits federal subsidies from being used for insurance policies that cover abortion. The agency will issue guidelines for insurers Friday on how they have to charge women who want abortion coverage at least $12 a year more for such a policy, and they have to keep that money in a separate fund to be used only to pay for abortions.
The Trump administration's rule is likely to face its own legal challenges from groups that favor contraception.
PanARMENIAN.Net - Arsenal scored a sensational 5-1 win Everton on Saturday, February 3 as both Armenian midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Gabon international Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang were handed their first Premier League starts with the Gunners.
Mkhitaryan, in particular, became the first Arsenal player to provide three or more assists in a Premier League game since Santi Cazorla vs Wigan in May 2013.
The Armenia international provided the assist for Aaron Ramsey's opener before setting up Aubameyang who netted the Gunners' fourth goal before the break.
Mkhitaryan made their third assist of the match in the 74th minute when they provided the ball for Ramsey's hat-trick goal.
“Mkhitaryan has [an opportunity] and I believe they have an opportunity to show they can be successful in the Premier League,” Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said of the Armenian prior to the match.
“He was a player at Borussia Dortmund who was admired by me and everybody else.”

Worried by the scarcity of kerosene, major stakeholders in oil and gas industry have advocated for the involvement of micro finance banks across the country in distribution of the product.
According to them, the involvement of micro finance banks would not only act as a bridge between the supplier and the end user, but ensuring that the product as well as right pricing get to the end users.
The stakeholders, who spoke while interacting with members of House of Representatives Committee on Petroleum Resources (Downstream) at Calabar Free Trade Zone over the weakened, decried the activities of middlemen in the industry and suggested that with intervention of micro finance banks, undue price would not be transferred from the depot to the end users by middlemen.
Expressing worry at the activities of middlemen in the industry middlemen in their CFTZ office in Calabar, the Managing Director of Fyn field Fynefield, Petroleum, Mr Akshay Saxena, they said since cardinal points of the Committee visits is to make sure the right price of kerosene gets to the consumer in quality and at cheaper rate, it is important that we understand the system first.
Saxena explained that between the time of depots' sells and distribution to the surface tanks owners, there are lots of price differentials in between, adding that most people who retail this product, DPK, are mostly surface tanks owners sometimes who sells in large quantity more than filling stations.
According to him, most of the retailers of kerosene are mostly housewives, little businesswomen and men who can sell between 5, 000 and 10, 000 litres of kerosene but cannot stock up their tanks as they don't have enough money to pay in bulk to suppliers.
The MD said: “But the middlemen who have money to pay and buy large quantity would end up getting some discounts from depots. They then go back to these retailers and charge huge credit from these surface tanks owners and they end up hiking the price enormously. So, because the surface tanks owners are getting it from bulk buyers/middlemen on credit have no option than to accept it.
“So, you find a situation whereby a depot that sells a litre of kero for instance at N135 to middlemen would end selling it end user at N200 to these surface tanks owners who also in turn would add addition N5 or N10 to make profit, thereby selling to end user at N210. So as government price increases, this has been the case in the last two years, so also do retailers increase to remain in the market. Also this is because of supply demand theory.
“I, therefore, suggest that govt should create a platform whereby the microfinance banks come into the picture and take the position of these middlemen, who buys product and supply on credit at exorbitant rate to surface tanks owners.
“By empowering micro finance banks to fill up the gap, they would have ended up doing one of their lines businesses, which is to provide opportunity for people at micro level do businesses.
“Besides, they would act a bridge between the supplier and the end user, thereby ensuring that the right pricing gets to them; the price that would not be transferred from the depot to the end user. Probably only transport cost and a little interest the Micro finance would charge the surface tanks owners since the banks would be giving them some credit for some time.”
He, however, advised that Department of Petroleum Resources, DPR, should regulate the micro finance banks to ensure that these surface tanks owners are actually surface tanks or not so that they can have date base and begin to improve upon the consumption battle.
They commended NNPC by trying to ensure that out 10m litres of DPK consumed locally daily, they bridge it by 5m litres while the other 5 m litres is imported.
Also speaking, the Executive Director of Ifafon oil Ltd, My Ignatius Edema, said the committee should come up with recommendation on how best to finance the finance importation as exchange rate is so high that nobody would import a product at higher price and sell at a loss.
They said the world is going biodiesel so Nigeria oil industry should not be left behind.
Responding the Chairman of House of Reps committee on petroleum resources, Downstream) Dr Joseph Akinlaja, commended them for safety measures and suggestions on how to make kerosene affordable, unadulterated and manageable, especially .intervening through the micro finance banks on the product distribution.
Akinlaja said: “We came here to assess and see how kerosene can be affordable to all at high quality and low price. We commend the depots for their planed investment in hydro-carbon because the future of Nigeria depends on gas. Well CFTZ is an asset to the Nigeria's economic development.
“We have come to know why kerosene is expensive and also come to ask the players –those in supply and distribution-in the industry what way forward. We are actually concerned with kerosene explosion as a result of no fault of theirs.
“We have identified a whole lot of problem ranging from haulage, distribution to surface tanks issues. And we want to see how these challenges can be reduced to a minimal level.
Companies visited by the committee include FynField, Ibafon, Linc and DOZZY.

SHIKARPUR - At least two people were killed and four others injured in an armed clash between two rival groups here on Sunday.
Police said that two groups of Junejo clan who were in an old dispute traded fire in Mirzapur locality of Shikarpur. In cross firing, two people were killed and four others sustained injuries. The bodies and injured were shifted to hospital for medico-legal formalities. The firing continued for quite some time as police were late to reach the spot. The police have registered cases against armed men of both groups and started raids for their arrest.

It might sound like the tagline from an old science fiction B-movie (It Came from the Ant Nebula!), but as it turns out, there really is a powerful laser beam shooting out of the distant Ant Nebula some 8,000 light-years away. Is this an attempt at intergalactic communication, or is some strange and unknown natural phenomenon afoot?
Probably the latter. Although would we really be able to tell the two apart? The anomalous laser from the Ant Nebula was discovered by the European Space Agency (ESA) at the Herschel space observatory, one of the largest infrared telescopes in space. Recent observations conducted by Herschel have revealed an intense laser emission coming straight from the core of the nebula, and scientists aren't quite sure exactly what is producing the beam.
There are a few extremely rare phenomena which can generate lasers inside of nebulae. Curiously, astronomer Donald Menzel was the first to suggest that lasers could be produced by nebulae in space, and Menzel also happens to be the astronomer who discovered the Ant Nebula (its official name is Menzel 3). According to Menzel's theories, certain types of radioactive gases can accrete in dense clouds close to stars, and these gases can amplify stars' light enough to produce beams of laser light.
Dr Isabel Aleman, lead author of the new study of the Ant Nebula lasers, says the coincidence of discovering a laser coming from this particular nebula is astonishing:
We detected a very rare type of emission called hydrogen recombination laser emission, which is only produced in a narrow range of physical conditions. Such emission has only been identified in a handful of objects before and it is a happy coincidence that we detected the kind of emission that Menzel suggested, in one of the planetary nebulae that they discovered.
The Ant Nebula gets its name from the fact that it consists of two lobes of gas which resemble the head and thorax of an ant. While I'm sure there are rare examples in which lasers can be generated by clouds of radioactive gas, I just have to wonder: if this was an alien race's attempt at communication, would we even know it? What might the horrible ant creatures of the Ant Nebula be trying to tell us?
NASA scientists have discovered a special kind of neutron star for the first time outside of the Milky Way galaxy and released a stunning image of the stellar body located 200,000 light years from Earth.
Neutron stars are the ultra-dense cores of massive stars that collapse and undergo a supernova explosion. The newly identified neutron star, discovered using data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile, is a rare variety that has both a low magnetic field and no stellar companion. The neutron star is located within the remains of a supernova — known as 1E 0102.2-7219 (E0102) — in the Small Magellanic Cloud, located 200,000 light years from Earth.
A new composite image of E0102 allows astronomers to learn new details about this object that was discovered more than three decades ago. Oxygen-rich supernova remnants like E0102 are important for understanding how massive stars fuse lighter elements into heavier ones before they explode. Seen up to a few thousand years after the original explosion, oxygen-rich remnants contain the debris ejected from the dead star's interior. This debris is observed today hurtling through space after being expelled at millions of miles per hour. Chandra observations of E0102 show that the supernova remnant is dominated by a large ring-shaped structure in X-rays, associated with the blast wave of the supernova.
#News: A special kind of neutron star has been discovered for the first time outside of our Milky Way galaxy! This lonely star has no companion star, only an oxygen-rich ring of debris from the supernova explosion that created it about 2 millennia ago: https://t.co/fwjPYlHgYW pic.twitter.com/LRXzinziRZ — Chandra Observatory (@chandraxray) May 23, 2018
The new MUSE data revealed a smaller ring of gas that is expanding more slowly than the blast wave. At the center of this ring is a blue point-like source of X-rays. Together, the small ring and point source act like a celestial bull's eye. The combined Chandra and MUSE data suggest that this source is an isolated neutron star, created in the supernova explosion about two millennia ago. The X-ray energy signature, or ‘spectrum,' of this source is very similar to that of the neutron stars located at the center of two other famous oxygen-rich supernova remnants: Cassiopeia A (Cas A) and Puppis A. These two neutron stars also do not have companion stars.
The lack of evidence for extended radio emission or pulsed X-ray radiation, typically associated with rapidly rotating highly-magnetised neutron stars, indicates that the astronomers have detected the X-radiation from the hot surface of an isolated neutron star with low magnetic fields. About ten such objects have been detected in the Milky Way galaxy, but this is the first one detected outside our galaxy. Future observations of E0102 at X-ray, optical, and radio wavelengths should help astronomers understand how the neutron star ended up in its current position, seemingly offset from the centre of the circular shell of X-ray emission produced by the blast wave of the supernova.

Late last week, a video went viral featuring a Knoxville, Tennessee boy named Keaton Jones. The video shows Jones recounting their experience with bullying at school, which was posted by their mother to social media. At the end of the video, Jones heartbreakingly declares, "It'll probably get better one day." Chris Evans and Mark Ruffalo are trying to make sure that day comes very soon, as they've invited them to the Avengers: Infinity War premiere next year.
Yes, Chris Evans, the man who plays Captain America on screen in the MCU and Mark Ruffalo, the actor behind the Hulk and Bruce Banner, both took to social media to reach out to Keaton Jones. Evans was first, turning into a real-life hero as they reached out to Jones, offering some encouragement and, no doubt coolest of all, an invite for them and their mom to go to the Avengers: Infinity War premiere. Here's what they had to say.
"Stay strong, Keaton. Don't let them make you turn cold. I promise it gets better. While those punks at your school are deciding what kind of people they want to be in this world, how would you and your mom like to come to the Avengers premiere in LA next year?"
Mark Ruffalo shortly after followed suit. On Twitter, Ruffalo reached out saying, "Keaton, will you've my guest at the Premiere of #InfinityWar too? I think you are about one of the coolest kids I have ever seen! Can't wait to meet you in person, pal. Forget those ignorant kids. One day, very soon, they are going to feel pretty stupid for this." If those bullies aren't already feeling a little stupid, they more than likely will when Keaton Jones gets to hang out with The Avengers next year and see one of the biggest movies of 2018 before anyone else.
Playing heroes on screen is one thing. It gives kids people to look up to, which is good. But Chris Evans and Mark Ruffalo reaching out this way is on another level. Mark Hamill, the man behind Luke Skywalker, is also known to be a great dude in real-life and reached out to Keaton Jones on Twitter as well.
"Keaton, Don't waste time wondering why a bully would be so mean. They're sad people who think hurting others will make them feel better because they really don't like themselves. They're just jealous because you're so smart & handsome. Your friend, mh"
Keaton Jones' video and the experiences he's had to endure at the hands of their schoolmates is tragic, but the video is helping to shine a light on the issue. And, thanks to guys like Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo and Mark Hamill, they are trying to turn a big negative into a big positive. You can check out Chris Evans Twitter, plus Mark Ruafflo and Mark Hamill's responses to Jones' video, as well as the origianl video.

KARACHI - Pakistan People's Party (PPP) Senator Saeed Ghani on Sunday expressed concern over nation's silence on the Rs500 billion fall in national exports in the last three years.
Ghani said they feared that another financial scandal of the Sharif brothers involving a cartel of money launderers was on the way.
“If the Panama scandal and offshore companies are anything to go by, it will be no surprise that Sharif's cartel is found involved in siphoning off 20 percent of exports for personal windfall profits,” the PPP senator stated.
Over the last three years, they said, export earnings declined by nearly 20 per cent in terms of US dollar, falling from $25.1 billion to $20.8b. They said that two key sectors of the economy had floundered since 2013 — agriculture and exports and both accounted for almost one-third of Pakistan's GDP.
Soon after they were sworn in as president of Pakistan, the PPP senator, Asif Ali Zardari started persuading the EU to award the GSP-Plus status to Pakistan and allow zero duty on Pakistani exports to European countries. They said the EU finally approved the GSP-Plus status for Pakistan in 2013. But, they said, the Sharif government had failed to make an effective use of the GSP-Plus facility due to its lacklustre policy response, indifference towards exports and bizarre priorities.
Senator Saeed Ghani warned that such a drastic fall in exports would unleash a storm of unemployment in the country and turn millions of skilled and unskilled labourers jobless.
“The loss of a staggering amount of Rs500 billion in foreign exchange is a major jolt for our economy. Its aftershocks will be very destructive. There is a great need to increase exports and capitalise on the hard-earned GSP-Plus status,” they said.
Earlier, Ghani condemned victimisation of former federal minister Samina Khalid Ghurki by the Punjab government.
In a statement issued here on Sunday, Ghani said the Punjab government had started victimisation of PPP leaders after the party leadership announced public rallies against the rulers in every corner of the country.
“It is extremely shameful that the Punjab government is harassing former National Assembly Member Samina Khalid Ghurki through police,” they said. “The Punjab government has the blood of innocent people of Model Town, Lahore, on its hands and now it has started harassing and victimising PPP workers. A false and concocted FIR against Samina Khalid Ghurki has exposed the ugly face of the government.”
SBC asks senior members to take charge of SHCBA
The Sindh Bar Council has directed its four senior members to take charge of the Sindh High Court Bar Association, Hyderabad, because it failed to conduct the bar's annual elections. According to a letter issued by the SBC Secretary Zain-ul-Abidin on Dec 31, the council's executive committee directed for the step after taking notice of the delay in conducting the fresh polls.
The secretary further directed the members to verify the list of members within seven days and submit the same to the council for preparation of the final voter lists.
The polling to elect the new body was already scheduled for January 14, the letter reads.
The members who had been given the task, include Ahmed Nawaz Khan Pechuho, Arbab Ali Chandio, Sain Bakhsh Nizamani and Irfan Ahmed Siddiqui.
Trinidad and Tobago denied United States a seventh successive world 4x400 metres relay title when Lalonde Gordon overhauled Fred Kerley on the final straight to win a breathtaking final at the World Athletics Championships on Sunday.The U.S led for most of the race and appeared to be on course for another win after Michael Cherry ran a strong third lap to extend their lead before handing the baton to Kerley.But Gordon gave chase and ran a superb final lap for the Caribbean islands, catching the American on the home straight to give Trinidad their first world title in this event and add to the list of upsets at the championships.It was just reward for Lalonde who was part of the Trinidad team which took bronze on the same track at the London Olympics five years ago and won silver at the Beijing World Championships in 2015.Jereem Richards, bronze medallist in the 200 metres, and Machel Cedenio also kept them in contention in the second and third legs as Trinidad claimed their first and only gold of the championships.Martyn Rooney put up a brave chase for Britain but was unable to haul in the leading pair and the hosts took bronze.Trinidad's time of 2:58.12 was the fastest this year."We knew the U.S. team are always strong and we were prepared for that," Cedenio said."I think it was the best experience of all my career....We came third in 2012 in the national record. Now it is gold and I cannot ask for more."Jamaica and Bahamas, Olympic silver and bronze medallists respectively in Rio de Janeiro last year, both failed to qualify for the final as did Botswana, another of the favourites, after they dropped the baton in the semi-finals.The United States, who are also Olympic champions, last failed to win the world title in Paris in 2003."I got the lead for the fourth leg," Cherry said. "Silver is a good medal. You never expect to lose coming into a race. We gave all we had.”
Austin Eggleston, 15, was told in a life-changing moment by their doctor, dressed as Chewbacca, that he's getting a heart transplant.

The Saudi-led coalition that is fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen is responsible for the deaths of scores of children since last summer, a United Nations report says.
Al Jazeera obtained excerpts from the confidential report by the UN Office on Children and Armed Conflict, which was sent to the UN Security Council on January 19.
According to the excerpts, the Saudi-led coalition killed 68 children and wounded 36 others from July to September 2017.
The report found there were at least 20 coalition raids every day – some targeting schools and homes.
Saudi Arabia, together with several other Arab nations, launched a military campaign in 2015 that aimed at rolling back advances made by Houthi rebels after they overran much of the country, including the capital, Sanaa, in 2014.
The Saudi-led intervention initially consisted of a bombing campaign and later saw a naval blockade and the deployment of ground forces into Yemen.
The coalition says it is attacking positions of the Houthi rebels in response to a request from the internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
Houthi killings
In addition to the coalition, the UN report also points fingers at the Houthis, blaming the rebels for the deaths of 18 children since last summer. Another 29 children were wounded in attacks by Houthis in the same period, the report says.
The report also notes that recruitment of children to fight has increased, particularly by the Houthis and the Yemeni National Army.
The UN describes the situation in Yemen as “the worst human-made humanitarian crisis” in the world, with the ongoing conflict making an already dire situation worse.
Speaking to Al Jazeera from Sanaa, Shabia Mantoo, spokesperson for the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said thousands in Yemen are in desperate need of aid.
“It's not just affecting children. It's affecting everyone. It's affecting 75 percent of the population. So our concern is that as long as this conflict continues, we're going to see more and more casualties. We're also going to see the humanitarian needs rise as well.
“So, children, women, the elderly, people with particular vulnerabilities; they are suffering the most in Yemen at the moment,” Mantoo said.
According to the UN children's aid agency, UNICEF, more than 5,000 children have been killed or injured in the war – an average of five children a day – since the conflict escalated in March 2015.
UNICEF also says that more than 11 million children are in need of humanitarian assistance and nearly two million children are suffering from acute malnutrition.
In addition to a massive cholera outbreak, Yemen has also seen outbreaks of diphtheria in recent months.
Suze van Meegen, spokesperson of Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) in Yemen, said it is time the international community wakes up to the humanitarian situation in the country.
“It is astounding to me that we have the United Nations Security Council that has not commented on Yemen in, now more than seven months. The scale of suffering in Yemen is incomparable. We have 22 million people in need.
“We are speaking to families who are fleeing their homes because of violence and constructing houses out of plastic bags. People don't have enough to eat. They're forced to eat whatever they can find.
“This sort of suffering is inexcusable, and we would really like to see some action taken from the US, the UK and the United Nations Security Council,” Van Meegen told Al Jazeera.

There's nothing too sweet for Jonathan Cheban.
Page Six recently tagged along with the Foodgod to Cool Mess on the Upper East Side to make some ice cream.
“We're going to one of my favorite places in the city, on the Upper East side, it's called Cool Mess,” they say. “And like you make your own ice cream, which is like incredible. It's definitely a fun New York City place to go on a date, to bring your kids.”
Joined by company founder Marguerite Loucas, the reality star proceeds to see just how many different types of candy they can mix into one batch of ice cream, including their favorite breakfast cereal.
“I'm a big Fruity Pebbles guy,” they admit. “I love it. This is my favorite flavor on anything. Something about Fruity Pebbles just makes me happy.”
The concoction — which also included Sour Patch Kids, toasted marshmallow jellybeans, gummy bears, cake batter; but no green stuff or chocolate, both of which Cheban says they hate — earned a rave review from the reality star.
“I'm blessing this place,” they say after dishing out ice cream to a group of high schoolers. “I blessed the ice cream. That's what I do, I come, I bless you and I get out.”
Lawsuit claims 21st Century Oncology paid millions to physicians for referrals
Records from a federal lawsuit against 21st Century Oncology first filed last February, have been unsealed.
The lawsuit claims the company which is headquartered in Fort Myers, illegally paid millions of dollars in bonuses to physicians for referrals made to company facilities.
That's a violation of federal regulations under the Stark Law.
The lawsuit claims the practice began in 2010 and has resulted in millions of dollars of damages to patients.
The News-Press reports 21st Century Oncology has tentatively agreed to pay $26 million to settle the case.
21st Century Oncology filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection in May and faced multiple lawsuits following a 2015 data breach of 2.2 million patient records.

They said in a statement: “The company fully cooperated with the government in resolving these historical matters and has no further comment.”

‘Alligator Man' investigated over videos posted on social media
A Lake County man who calls themselves the “Alligator Man” on social media is being investigated after they posted videos and pictures online of them posing with a small alligator, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officials said.
In a video viewed by more than 7,000 people, you can see the Leesburg man, identified by FWC officials as Jordan Bedford, dancing with the baby gator on a leash while someone in the background sings “Go, Alligator man!”
The alligator, which Bedford was holding by its tail, had tape around its mouth.
Bedford posted the video on Facebook with a caption that said, in part, “(I'm the) only person I know to walk an alligator in a leash.”
The Nov. 2 video received a lot of attention on social media, but it wasn't Bedford's first post with the alligator.
On Aug. 16, they posted a video where they were dragging the small reptile by a leash. In the caption of that post, Bedford wrote that since people raised lions in Dubai, they wanted to raise an alligator.
They also said in the video that they trained all wildlife.
“We train dogs, we train gators. Hey, you got a horse? Whatever you got, bring it to me. I'll train it,” Bedford said in the video.
Bedford said it was their “new pet” and called the alligator “Lebron” in the video.
The reptile could be heard in the video making noises as it was pulled on the leash with tape around its mouth.
It is unknown whether Bedford has a license to keep the alligator, but FWC officials confirmed that they are looking into the posts.
News 6 reached out to Bedford for comment but is still waiting to hear back.

Sohail Khan/Atif Khakwani-BAHAWALNAGAR-Six persons including a woman along with their two daughters and a son were killed and 11 others sustained injuries after Sui gas pipeline exploded with a bag due to leakage here on Tuesday.
The police said that the explosion occurred in a house situated on Circular Road here in Bahawalnagar city.
The two-storey house razed to ground to the blast while the two adjacent houses damaged severely, the police and rescuers said.
According to police and Rescue 1122, a gas pipeline exploded due to leakage on ground floor of a house owned by Wazir Ahmed, a court clerk. As a result, six persons including their wife Muneerah Bibi, 20, their five-year-old daughter Benish, son 12-year-old Zaheer Ahmed, another daughter Goshi, 4; Attia, daughter of Abdul Ghaffar and Bashir Ahmed died while eleven others sustained injuries. The explosion was so loud that the adjacent buildings were also affected adversely. The rescue teams rushed to the spot and started rescue work. Rescue 1122, Army officials and volunteers of Falah-e-Insaniate Foundation pulled out the injured and dead bodies and shifted to District Headquarters Hospital Bahawalnagar. Later, four the injured persons were referred to Bahawalpur and Lahore due to critical condition. The hospital sources fear the death toll could rise. The police said that real cause of the incident is yet to be ascertained.
The rescue said the incident occurred due gas leakage in the ground floor of a two-storey residential building which was razed to the ground while the two adjacent buildings also damage severely. The blast took place around 2:20pm.
DC Azhar Hayat, DPO Liaqat Ali Malik, ADC Rana Amjad, DO Civil Defence Mirza Siddique and staff of other agencies also rushed to the scene immediately after the blast. The rescue crane, excavator and tractors reached the scene a little late, which angered the residents.
Sensing urgency of the situation, DC Azhar Hayat called in Pakistan army personnel who rushed to the spot in no time. The army personnel along with Rescue 1122 rescuers and volunteers completed the operation.
A group of inspiring young athletes with special needs stole the show at the Cheer NB Provincial cheerleading championships this weekend.
Among them was a Moncton woman who has proven they have the grit and determination of a true champion.
“I had to lift someone up,” said 22-year-old Carley Hopper who performed with Moncton's Olympia Allstar Cheerleading.

Hooper is on a cheerleading team with a group of young women, all with special needs. Performing at the provincials in front of a hometown crowd in Moncton over the weekend was their big moment.
It was a lot of pressure, according to Hooper's mother Shelley Sherwood-Hopper. Shelley said to make sure that Hopper was ready to handle the stress and that all of their medications were in order.
“She was born in distress, the cord was wrapped around their neck and so they had seizures when they were born,” Shelley said, adding that even though Hopper takes medication every day, the seizures have never really stopped.
Hooper said they knew when the seizure was coming on: “It feels like a tickle in my throat.”
On Sunday, just before getting set onstage for their big routine, Hopper felt that dreaded tickle.
“She had a seizure in the bathroom,” said their mother.

That's when they and a group of strangers huddled in the washroom and became Hopper's personal cheerleaders.
“It was awesome because usually people just look away,” said Shelley.
They gathered around to make sure they were safe while the seizure went on for two agonizing minutes.
“I said, ‘Are you able to get up?' and they said, ‘Yes,' they wanted to do their part because they had to lift the girls,” said Shelley who added that Hopper often needs to rest after a seizure.
“It does make me a little tired,” Hopper said.
No one, including their mother, thought that they would have the strength to compete.

But mere minutes after their seizures stopped, Hopper hit the stage much to the amazement of their squad and their parents.
All decked out in their purple bling, they danced, kicked and rolled through their routine in front of a crowd of roaring and adoring fans.
Shelley said their daughter did their job and hoisted their teammate high into the air: “I am very proud of her.”
It's official. B.C.'s NDP government says it will complete the controversial Site C dam megaproject.
The government says failing to carry on with the dam will leave British Columbians on the hook for $4 billion in debt, putting programs like childcare and housing at risk.
“Megaproject mismanagement by the old government has left B.C. in a terrible situation,” said Premier John Horgan in a statement. “But we cannot punish British Columbians for those mistakes, and we can't change the past. We can only make the best decision for the future.”
Horgan said the province will now launch a “turnaround program” designed to contain costs and add benefits to the project.
That plan will include a new Project Assurance Board charged with overseeing spending, quality and environmental integrity. It will also create a new First Nations benefits program and BC Food Security Fund to boost the province's farming industry.
Construction on the project has been underway since 2016, and the province has already spent upwards of $2 billion to make it happen.

The future of the $10.7-billion project has been a looming question ever since the NDP took power in July.
During the 2017 election, the party refused to take a firm position on Site C, instead pledging to send it for a review by the BC Utilities Commission (BCUC).
A report from the regulator earlier this fall found the project was unlikely to be either on time or on budget.
WATCH: Site C dam in jeopardy?
However, the NDP has faced enormous pressure from both sides regarding the project's future.
On one side are its allies in government, the BC Greens, who are adamantly opposed – along with First Nations, environmentalists and landowners who argued the project is not needed and would cause irreparable ecological damage.

On the other side are the business community and independent and unionized building trades who argued the project would create thousands of well-paying jobs; BC Hydro, which argued the dam would provide clean power needed to meet future demand; and the BC Liberal opposition.
About 2,000 workers are already on site, and the former BC Liberal government argued the project would eventually create as many as 10,000 jobs.
WATCH: UBC report calls for the plug to be pulled on Site C dam
Conflicting reports
Making the decision even thornier for the government was the multitude of reports commissioned on the risks and benefits of Site C.
In its final report in November, the BCUC found the project would likely miss its slated 2024 completion date, and could exceed its original $8.3-billion budget by 20 to 50 per cent.
It found that scrapping the project would cost the province nearly $4 billion — $2.1 billion in sunk construction costs and $1.8 billion to wind down the project.
READ MORE: Cancelling Site C project would save B.C. $1.6B: report
The report also found that BC Hydro's forecast for future power demand was “excessively optimistic” and suggested plummeting prices for alternative power sources could make them an attractive alternative.
BC Hydro disputed that last point — arguing the BCUC had underestimated the benefits of Site C compared to alternative power by as much as $800 million.
The Allied Hydro Council of BC (AHC), a union group, also questioned the BCUC report, arguing that a one-per-cent annual increase in power demand in the next two decades would actually necessitate three site C dams.
WATCH: Delaying Site C dam in B.C. could cost $600M: Clark
It said the BCUC did not adequately weight the money already sunk into the project, and said with virtually no solar or geothermal power plants already in operation, shifting alternative power sources would be unrealistic.
The BCUC has since acknowledged that ratepayers could also face a 10 per cent or greater rate hike, if the province was to absorb the full $4 billion cost of scrapping the dam in a single decade.
Adding to the complexity of the government's decision was the initial 2014 report from the federal-provincial joint review panel that was initially charged with reviewing the project.
The panel found that the dam, which would flood 100 kilometres of river valley and 3,000 hectares of wildlife habitat, would have adverse effects on First Nations' use of the land, along with sensitive ecosystems.
However, it also found the economic and energy benefits of the project outweighed the risks, and that the dam would “produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than any source save nuclear.”

Decades of debate
The decision ends nearly four decades of debate over Site C.
Plans for the dam have been on the books since the late 1970s, when it was proposed as the third in a series of hydroelectric projects in the Peace River Valley.
Site C actually went before the BCUC twice in the 1980s, and was rejected both times.

However, BC Hydro has owned the land since then and it has kept plans on the books.
Former premier Gordon Campbell revived the project in 2010, arguing the dam – which would provide power to the equivalent of 450,000 homes – was needed to meet growing electricity demand.
BC Liberal changes to provincial environmental laws also meant the dam wouldn't require a review by the BCUC this time.
The project earned federal and provincial environmental certificates in October 2014 and won the final green light from former premier Christy Clark the following month.
Since then, it has faced multiple unsuccessful court challenges from the West Moberly and Prophet River First Nations and local farmers, and an occupation by protesters.
(Reuters) - Two United Parcel Service Inc employees were injured in an explosion on Wednesday that caused significant damage to one of the package delivery company's freight facilities in Lexington, Kentucky, a UPS spokesperson said.
UPS said a gas leak from propane tanks inside a trailer may have caused the morning blast, some 80 miles east of Louisville. The company said the employees received minor injuries and that it shut down operations.
UPS spokesperson Glenn Zaccara said they did not know when operations were expected to resume or how much freight volume was disrupted by the blast.
The Lexington Fire Department said six people were taken to a local hospital for observation after the blast.
Fire officials said the explosion caused significant structural damage to a maintenance facility, with the walls and roof the hardest hit.
A photo released by the fire department appeared to show chunks of twisted metal and debris on the ground and roof in a loading area. The building was still standing.
"Nothing leads us to believe this is anything other than an accidental explosion," the fire department said in a string of tweets starting just after 8 a.m. EDT.
The building was evacuated and all employees have been accounted for, the fire department said.
UPS said it was working with authorities on an investigation.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince William and Kate Middleton, welcomed their third child, a son, on April 23 at 11:01 a.m. London time. In other words, Princess Charlotte is now a big sister and a middle child. You might wonder if they — or your own middle child — is doomed to become resentful and jealous, like the stereotype claims. Can being a middle child actually determine who you are or who you become? Researchers have long tried to separate the myths from the facts about middle children, and their results might surprise you.
Fortunately for Princess Charlotte, and middle children everywhere, research shows that despite their reputation as lonely and jealous, middle children are owners of more than a few incredible traits. As Insider reports, theories about so-called middle-child syndrome — feeling simultaneously second-best to your older sibling and replaced by your younger sibling — have been around since doctor and psychotherapist Alfred Adler started researching birth order in the 1930s. However, as psychologist Dr. Laurie Zelinger, PhD, told Insider, those feelings of resentment and replacement are not a given. Not surprisingly, how you parent your middle child influences how they grow and develop. So, as Katrin Schumann, author of The Secret Power of Middle Children, tells Psychology Today, middle children can become friendly, innovative team-players once they are adults because of, and not in spite of, their unique experiences growing up in families with both older and younger siblings.
If you have a middle child, or if you are a middle child, you should definitely not overlook what science actually has to say about this particular birth order. So with that in mind, read on for some facts that may or may not challenge your pre-conceived notions about the true princes and princesses of the family: middle children.
They're Great BFFs Giphy As Psychologist Catherine Salmon, PhD explained to Business Insider, middle children are surprisingly social people and are able to get along with pretty much anyone. Salmon notes that they will also do just about anything for their friends. On the downside, this tendency might actually make them too cooperative, and willing to do things that, well, break the rules.
They Take Risks It makes total sense that if middle kids go unnoticed by their parents, they might be more inclined to take risks — like jumping off the top of the monkey bars — to gain some attention. As Schumann tells Psychology Today, a willingness to take risks can actually make middle children great at business or willing to fight for social justice.
They Hate Conflict Giphy As Schumann explains to Psychology Today, middle children absolutely hate conflict, which might create problems for them when they are older, specifically at work and in relationships. But, as Frank Sulloway, PhD explains to Reader's Digest, a middle child's desire to avoid fights — and experience being in the middle of them — might actually make them great negotiators and problem-solvers, too.
They Need Self-Esteem Support As Zellinger explains to Insider, your middle child might need a confidence boost every once in a while. This is especially true when their older brother or sister seems to be better at everything and, as a result, they feel second best. Schumann adds that having a lower self-esteem than a first or last-born child might not be a bad thing, though, because it means they are less likely to think the world revolves around them.
They're Team Players Giphy As Reader's Digest reports, one study published in the Journal of Genetic Psychology showed that middle children work better in groups than children born first or last. This makes sense, because they have always had a sibling with whom they have had to share. Schumann explains to Psychology Today that, as adults, middle kids are both natural team players and also fairly independent, which makes them great co-workers.
They Grow Up To Be Free-Range Parents Schumann tells Psychology Today that their parenting study found that middle children often become really laid-back parents. This might be due to wanting to let their kids have the independence they experienced as children, or a desire to be lax about rules and structure.
Informal traders in Mogwase, North West argue that closing their businesses will make them dependent on the state. By Ohene Yaw Ampofo-Anti for GROUNDUP.
First published by GroundUp
The Mahikeng High Court will soon hear an application brought by Transnet to evict more than 40 informal traders from land which it claims to own in Mogwase, North West. The informal traders are represented by the Socio-Economic Rights Institute (SERI), which has raised a novel defence that could radically alter the circumstances in which the state may evict informal traders.
Mogwase has a railway line running through it, but also has a shopping centre and an area with informal traders. The ownership of the land and the exact location of the informal traders' stalls however is in dispute.
Transnet's application tries to prohibit the informal traders from continuing to operate their businesses on this land. It also wants the traders evicted. SERI represents 30 of the affected informal traders. (The other traders who have been cited have not yet defended the case.) There are five points of disagreement. The fifth and last one discussed below is the most interesting and important for future cases dealing with informal traders.
Is Transnet the owner of the property?
Transnet argues that it is the owner of the property by virtue of legislation which transferred the assets of the former South African Railway Services to Transnet in 1989. While Transnet concedes that the property is yet to be formally registered in its name, it argues that the property already technically belongs to it. (Most of Transnet's shares are owned by the state.) However, the market traders argue that the property was not transferred to Transnet because it formed part of the former Bantustan Republic of Bophuthatswana and was subsequently transferred to the government of the Republic of South Africa. In their view, the property was never transferred to Transnet.
Where are the market traders' stalls located?
Transnet contends that the market traders are trading from an area that is in close proximity to the railway tracks. It argues that the market traders pose a danger to the public. This is so because prospective customers including young children will be enticed to visit their stalls and cross the railway line in the process. The market traders argue however, that they are in a different location. Essentially, they argue that their stalls are behind a row of houses which are quite some distance from the railway line. In addition, they point out that there is a shopping complex and road nearby which already attracts a considerable number of people. For this reason, the market traders reject the argument that their activities pose any danger to the public.
Are the market traders trading illegally?
Transnet argues that the market traders' activities are unlawful because they are trading from its property without its permission. The market traders argue however that the legislation governing informal trading does not prohibit their activities. This is because the municipality has not established a licensing authority in the area. This means the traders neither need a license nor Transnet's permission in order to trade. Also, the relevant legislation prohibits a municipality from outlawing informal trading. It only allows the municipality to put in place certain restrictions on informal trading, a process which the market traders argue, the municipality is yet to follow. For all these reasons, the market traders argue that their activities are not unlawful.
Has Transnet engaged with the market traders?
Transnet says that it has engaged with the market traders and informed them that their activities are dangerous and that they should relocate. Also, Transnet argues that it has consulted with the relevant municipality. Transnet says the municipality has undertaken to construct a pedestrian bridge, relocate the market traders to a nearby piece of vacant land, and engage the provincial government for further assistance. Transnet argues that the municipality has failed to honour these agreements. It says it has taken all reasonable measures to engage with both the municipality and the market traders prior to seeking their eviction.
But the traders deny that Transnet has engaged directly with them. They argue that they are only aware of Transnet having engaged with the municipality. They contend that they were never invited to any of these engagements. They point out that the municipality is yet to show any concrete signs that it will indeed relocate the market traders to a nearby piece of land if they are evicted.
Would it be unfair to evict the market traders?
Having established that they own the property, that it should be used for the purpose of providing railway transport services, and that the activities of the market traders pose a danger to the public, Transnet concludes that it would be fair to evict the market traders.
The market traders raise a novel legal defence in response to this. They argue that they have a constitutional right to freedom of trade. Also, they argue that their constitutional right to dignity would also be infringed if they are evicted. This is because, they argue, the right to dignity includes the right to earn a living and take care of oneself and one's family so as not to be left destitute. The market traders go on to say that because Transnet is an organ of state it has a duty to respect, protect, promote and fulfil the rights in the Bill of Rights. The market traders argue that Transnet may not evict them until they find a solution which ensures that their fundamental rights will be protected.
To bolster this argument, the market traders also highlight their circumstances. First, they point out that some of them have been trading in Mogwase for more than 20 years. Second, many of them have dependents and are the breadwinners in their homes. Third, many of them are particularly vulnerable such as refugees or single women who head households. Also, they point out that there are no jobs in Mogwase and without their businesses they will be dependent on the state for support.
Why this case is important
The novel defence being raised by the market traders is that Transnet has a duty to protect their rights to dignity and freedom of trade and may only evict them when it can do so in a way that protects these rights. If this particular defence is accepted, it would be a huge win for informal traders who are often vulnerable to sudden eviction and the end of their businesses. But this defence is confined to cases in which an organ of state is the owner of the land. DM

Real Housewives of Dallas star Brandi Redmond may seem to have a beyond-enviable life, but it definitely hasn't been without its ups and downs. Though they already have two daughters together, Brooklyn and Brinkley, Brandi and their husband, Bryan Redmond, struggled for years to get pregnant after deciding they wanted a third child. But on Wednesday, People announced that Real Housewives of Dallas' Brandi Redmond has adopted a baby boy, and from the sounds of it, it was absolutely meant to be.
As anyone who has struggled with infertility knows, there is definitely nothing easy about not being able to get pregnant when you desperately want to, and Brandi told People that, while they and Bryan ultimately agreed to stop trying after years of failed attempts — including a miscarriage — they always felt like their family "wasn't complete." But just as the couple was resigning themselves to forever being a family of four, they found out about a baby boy born premature who was in need of adoptive parents. After they flew out to meet them in the NICU in a Texas hospital, Brandi said they "immediately fell in love," and decided to adopt the baby, whom they named Bruin. And now? Brandi told the magazine that their family was "one hundred and ten percent complete."
RHOD fans hoping to watch more of the Redmonds' journey as parents-of-three are in luck: Brandi told People that reality TV cameras "followed the whole thing from start to finish," and there's no doubt that viewers will find it pretty moving. But as much as Brandi's followers seem super happy for the couple, many were also thrilled that they were choosing to share their beautiful story with the world: on Instagram, a number of users chimed in to share that they, too, were adopted, with one commenter writing, "LOVE this and that you are sharing your journey of adoption!" and another chiming in to say that "this baby won the lottery having you as parents."
Even though Bruin doesn't have a genetic connection to their new family, Brandi says they were pleasantly surprised to see that they actually seem to share the family's ginger hair! They told People that meant he'd "always look like they came from [her]," but then added, "which they did — they came from my heart."
As hard as it is to struggle to conceive in general, Brandi also seemed to struggle a lot with feeling responsible for their infertility, as she'd actually undergone a "mommy makeover" after the birth of their girls, which included a tummy tuck. In a September 2017 episode of RHOD, they visited a fertility doctor who told them that "tons of people get pregnant after mommy makeovers without any problems," according to OK!, and that they shouldn't beat themselves up over it. But even still, Brandi said at the time that they blamed themselves for their miscarriage, and that, even if they were to get pregnant again, the risk of having another miscarriage or a complicated pregnancy "[weighed] heavily on [her]."
Even though they may not have necessarily been expecting to grow their family through adoption — Brandi told People their decision to adopt "happened pretty much overnight" — it seems pretty clear that they are thrilled to have Bruin in their lives. They said their son is "so, so happy," and that "he smiles all the time and just giggles and laughs." But given their son's difficult start in life as a premature baby in a hospital without any parents to care for him, it seems like their forever family is doing the best they can to make up for lost time. Brandi told People,
The only time they cry is when he's left alone. I'm sure that's a normal baby thing, but because of how we got him, I'm especially like, ‘No, you will never be left alone.'
Brandi and Bryan may have had to endure years of heartbreak over their inability to have another child on their own, but it definitely sounds like it worked out beautifully in the end. And while adoption might not be the right option for everyone, their story is a reminder that there are many different, amazing, ways to build a family.
Review: The Accountant
(MA15+) Ben Affleck, JK Simmons, Anna Kendrick
Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) has struggled all of their life to fit into society. Due to their father's military lifestyle and also having high-functioning autism, Christian had to learn to adapt to the world around him. Their father's unique teaching in self-defense, combined with acute abilities in mathematics, Christian manages to become a sought-after forensic accountant — for some of the world's most influential criminal organisations. Using their rare gifts for finding hidden discrepancies in the books of these groups, they unmask their internal problems. Many times, they also deal out justice in their own way, through more physical means. In the process of administering this vigilante-style of balancing the books, they cross paths with Treasury agent Ray King (J.K. Simmons). Ray King threatens to get more involved in Christian's business, when the exceptional accounant is hired by a cutting-edge robotics company. As they dig deeper into their files, their discoveries bring them closer to their own past, to being exposed and to putting innocent lives in jeopardy.
The premise of The Accountant has the potential to confuse and overwhelm movie fans, much less those who know little about accountancy. Thankfully, director Gavin O'Connor (Warrior) has ensured that a potential mess has turned into an entertaining thinking-person's film. O'Connor delves far enough into the world of autism and the world of military children to provide the background that lays the foundation for the situational ethics confronted by Wolff. Audiences also can understand their disposition and decision-making skills, so that their cold demeanour becomes winsome and even humorous at times.
Coming off their performance as Batman, Affleck takes on this role of a distant and focussed accountant with convincing intensity. The role is ideally suited for their persona and the slow-boil scripting is handled superbly by the accomplished actor. The surrounding cast adds to the quality of this action mystery. J.K. Simmons continues to provide the right amount of magnetism and measured control. As the veteran treasury agent, Simmons adds the earnestness that lifts the tension of the storyline. Partnered with relative newcomer Cynthia Addai-Robinson (Arrow), as a junior investigator, they make a formidable rival to the bookkeeping protagonist. Also in support, Anna Kendrick puts forward their best role in ages, but the inclusion of Jon Bernthal (Fury) as a competing assassin is a work of genius casting. O'Connor weaves together this exceptional cast with convincing direction that delivers a cinematic capital gain.
When it comes to a balanced consideration for this film, audiences must weigh up that it is a violent affair. Christian Wolff's self-administered justice and the parental style of their father may cause some to give this a miss. On the other side of the balance sheet is a fascinating study of being ‘fearfully and wonderfully made.' The manner in which the production team handles the ‘abilities' (as opposed to the ‘disabilities') of many of the lead characters is worth engaging with. The Accountant may run up against some of your sensibilities, but is a film worth considering because it delivers on the entertainment front and will lead to a multitude of conversation points after the screening.
What are the bigger questions to consider from this film?
I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well. Psalm 139: 14)
What do The Accountant and Finding Dory have in common? Both movies were released this year, have divergent storylines and are intended for completely different audiences. But what they both do is consider that we all have different abilities and skills. The gifts we have may seem odd to the outside world; dare it is said, even ‘Weird?' Yet, in looking at the Bible's account of each person on this earth, they were all made by and loved by God. These films and the Bible provide a different way to look at those with different ‘abilities'.
What should we know about disabilities?

Police say a man who intentionally struck a Goose Creek police car wouldn't let the police officer out of the vehicle and made gestures as if they were going to shoot the officer.
Ryan Jeffrey Moss, 41, was charged with attempted murder and locked up at the Berkeley County Detention Center.
GCPD officials say the incident happened Saturday afternoon when Moss used their Ford F-150 pickup to strike a parked police car while an officer was inside.
Police say the officer had parked in the rear parking area at Westview Elementary School about 50 yards off Westview Boulevard to work on their in-car computer.
Major John Grainger with Goose Creek police said the incident began when a truck entered the Westview school's property from the St. James Avenue entrance and proceeded in the direction of the elementary school past the parked buses. Grainger said the driver then got out and removed a portion of wooden fencing that separates the bus parking area with the ball-field.
Once back in the truck, the suspect accelerated the pickup rapidly across the ball-field and collided with the driver side of the patrol car, police said.
A police report states that shortly after the crash, the suspect stepped out of their truck and was making gestures at the officer as if "he was going to shoot her."
"He just got out saying he's going to shoot me," the officer could be heard saying in newly released 911 audio recordings.
Witnesses also reported that after Moss got out of the truck, they made multiple hand gestures as if shooting at the patrol car.
In addition, police say the suspect approached the police car and was blocking the door and not allowing the officer to leave their car.
The officer told emergency officials that the suspect may be in possession of a gun.
A responding GCPD officer said they saw Moss inside the suspect's truck smoking a cigarette following the incident. The officer said law enforcement drew their guns and attempted to make contact with Moss.
A report states that after several commands given by the officer and the BCSO deputies, the suspect exited their vehicle and was ordered to put their hands above their head.
The responding officer said after repeating the command several times, the suspect complied. According to a report, Moss told the responding officer they were asleep prior to their arrival and did not know why they were being detained.
"Moss advised the last thing they remembered was being at the fairgrounds, and they did not remember how they arrived at this location," the report stated.
Police said the suspect questioned if the tire tracks in the field located near the crash belong to theirs truck.
Investigators say Moss later changed their story from not knowing why officers had responded and asked,"Is everyone who is involved in an accident with a cop treated like this?"
The police report states Moss said they were tired from being awake for the past several days, and may have fallen asleep behind the wheel.
The officer in the damaged patrol car was transported for medical evaluation. Goose Creek police said they were discharged Saturday evening.
The patrol car was damaged significantly.
The motivation for the act is unknown, police say. They have no reason to believe there is any familiarity with the officer involved.

BEREA, Ohio -- Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett pronounced themselves ready for whatever when they make their NFL debut Sunday against the New York Jets.
Editor's Picks Browns leading (again) in chase for draft's first pick, per ESPN Analytics The analytics generated by ESPN show that, after four games, the Browns have the best chance for the NFL's first overall draft pick in 2018.
"I'll be out there as much as they want me to be," Garrett said Friday. "Whether it's a lot or a little."
Coach Hue Jackson had said Garrett would be on a pitch count in their first NFL game. Garrett has not played in any of the Browns' first four games after spraining their ankle in practice Sept. 6 before the opener. They returned to practice a week ago then was limited this week.
"Am I at my peak? No," Garrett said. "But it's good enough for me. I can move. I can run. I can bend. If I can do that, I can be out there and I can make a difference."
Defensive coordinator Gregg Williams said Garrett wanted to play Sunday against the Cincinnati Bengals, but the Browns held them back.
"He is not going out there thinking that I am going to go halfway," Williams said. "Myles is going out there with an attitude that they want to play and they want to play really, really well."
Said Garrett: "It is just about doing what I can, making the plays I am supposed to make and be who I am supposed to be on the field. Not be out of my gap or not missing any assignments, and then once I correct all of those and I have no hesitation or anything holding me back, then I can try to step forward and have a bigger role."
Garrett quipped that a sack would be special, calling it a "fat guy's touchdown." The Browns are just happy to have them on the field.
"It is not about if you go out there and have two sacks or three sacks," Jackson said. "That is not what this is about. This is about winning the game and playing the best you can play for as long as you can play."
Peshawar
Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pervez Khattak Monday said that Reshakai Industrial City was the centre of the province and would soon become the centre of industrial and commercial activities connecting the North and South parts of the province in the backdrop of CPEC.
They were presiding over a meeting to review progress of CPEC projects in the industries, energy and transport sectors here at Chief Minister House Peshawar.
The meeting was attended by Secretaries of Finance, Energy, Transport, Planning & Development departments and other high ups of the concerned sectors that focused on China-KP Economic Cooperation and the projects in industries, transport and energy sectors.
The participants were briefed about the projects in industries that included KP Comprehensive Special Economic Zones, projects under CPEC, Reshakai and Hattar Special Economic Zones, the MoUs signed between KP Government and Chinese public sector companies which would be presented in the core committee meeting.—APP
“Jonathan Martin, 60, a native of Atlanta, is coming from Dallas, where they have served as president and CEO of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra since 2012. They also served for nine years as general manager of the Cleveland Orchestra, including the period when the Ohio orchestra moved back into Severance Hall following a major renovation.”
For years, dark matter has been behaving badly. The term was first invoked nearly 80 years ago by the astronomer Fritz Zwicky, who realized that some unseen gravitational force was needed to stop individual galaxies from escaping giant galaxy clusters. Later, Vera Rubin and Kent Ford used unseen dark matter to explain why galaxies themselves don't fly apart.
Yet even though we use the term “dark matter” to describe these two situations, it's not clear that the same kind of stuff is at work. The simplest and most popular model holds that dark matter is made of weakly interacting particles that move about slowly under the force of gravity. This so-called “cold” dark matter accurately describes large-scale structures like galaxy clusters. However, it doesn't do a great job at predicting the rotation curves of individual galaxies. Dark matter seems to act differently at this scale.
In the latest effort to resolve this conundrum, two physicists have proposed that dark matter is capable of changing phases at different size scales. Justin Khoury, a physicist at the University of Pennsylvania, and their former postdoc Lasha Berezhiani, who is now at Princeton University, say that in the cold, dense environment of the galactic halo, dark matter condenses into a superfluid — an exotic quantum state of matter that has zero viscosity. If dark matter forms a superfluid at the galactic scale, it could give rise to a new force that would account for the observations that don't fit the cold dark matter model. Yet at the scale of galaxy clusters, the special conditions required for a superfluid state to form don't exist; here, dark matter behaves like conventional cold dark matter.
“It's a neat idea,” said Tim Tait, a particle physicist at the University of California, Irvine. “You get to have two different kinds of dark matter described by one thing.” And that neat idea may soon be testable. Although other physicists have toyed with similar ideas, Khoury and Berezhiani are nearing the point where they can extract testable predictions that would allow astronomers to explore whether our galaxy is swimming in a superfluid sea.
Impossible Superfluids
Here on Earth, superfluids aren't exactly commonplace. But physicists have been cooking them up in their labs since 1938. Cool down particles to sufficiently low temperatures and their quantum nature will start to emerge. Their matter waves will spread out and overlap with one other, eventually coordinating themselves to behave as if they were one big “superatom.” They will become coherent, much like the light particles in a laser all have the same energy and vibrate as one. These days even undergraduates create so-called Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in the lab, many of which can be classified as superfluids.
Superfluids don't exist in the everyday world — it's too warm for the necessary quantum effects to hold sway. Because of that, “probably ten years ago, people would have balked at this idea and just said ‘this is impossible,'” said Tait. But recently, more physicists have warmed to the possibility of superfluid phases forming naturally in the extreme conditions of space. Superfluids may exist inside neutron stars, and some researchers have speculated that space-time itself may be a superfluid. So why shouldn't dark matter have a superfluid phase, too?
To make a superfluid out of a collection of particles, you need to do two things: Pack the particles together at very high densities and cool them down to extremely low temperatures. In the lab, physicists (or undergraduates) confine the particles in an electromagnetic trap, then zap them with lasers to remove the kinetic energy and lower the temperature to just above absolute zero.

Sridevi, Shashi Kapoor to be honoured at New York Indian Film Festival with English Vinglish, Heat and Dust screenings
Indian cinema icons Shashi Kapoor and Sridevi will be remembered at the New York Indian Film Festival.
The event will be held from 7-12 May.
Shashi Kapoor, star of Merchant-Ivory films such as The Householder, will be honoured with the screenings of Shakespeare Wallah and Heat and Dust, reports Variety.
The fest will also hold a Merchant-Ivory retrospective that also includes the screening of Autobiography of a Princess, starring Madhur Jaffrey.
To honour Sridevi, their 2012 hit English Vinglish, which was mainly set in New York, will be screened.
Son of Prithviraj Kapoor and younger brother of Raj Kapoor and Shammi Kapoor, Shashi Kapoor made their debut in Bollywood with the 1961 film Dharmputra after working as a child artist. They passed away in December 2017.
Bollywood's ultimate "charm house" Shashi Kapoor then went on to make a name for themselves globally by associating with international cinema. They were honoured with the Padma Bhushan — the third highest civilian honour — by the Indian government in 2011.
Sridevi, known for their ability to slip into myriad roles, expressive eyes, sheer comic timing and their fluid dancing skills, died on 24 February. Them death left everyone shocked and saddened.
The fest opens on 7 May with Nude, a Marathi-language film directed by Ravi Jadhav.
The story centres around a single mother who gets a job as a nude model at an art school but fears the judgment of others and keeps their job a secret.
Hansal Mehta's Omerta, starring Rajkummar Rao, is the closing night film on 12 May. The film traces the life of British-Pakistani terrorist Omar Saeed Sheikh.

Meanwhile, Governor Hilario Davide III is encouraging President Rodrigo Duterte to continue their campaign against illegal drugs. They said having a long coastline to watch over and thousands of islands to guard make it difficult to prevent the entry of illegal drugs. “We do not have enough equipment,” they added.
“Lisod baya gyud. Kadtong iyang gi-promise before within six months, then nangayo siya ug extension if you'll remember within one year, now murag lisod gihapon, may be up to the end of their term,” Davide said.
They added that this is the reason why they did not promise to eliminate illegal drugs in the province during the campaign period.
In just a few months, Meghan Markle will become a "princess". The American actor is set to marry Prince Harry, who is a direct descendant of the royal throne and whose family is more British than fish and chips and stewed tomatoes. Needless to say, people are not only excited for them to get married, they're excited for them to start a family of their own. Both Markle and Prince Harry have both expressed their interest in starting a family, but there are some key signs that Meghan Markle will make a fantastic mom in the (hopefully near) future.
Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will marry at the end of May and from then will begin their incredibly exciting life together. After giving up their acting career and lifestyle blog (rest in peace, The Tig), they will look forward to a life of humanitarian and charity work, which isn't a far cry from the things they enjoyed doing as an actor (she was an ambassador for United Nations Women, according to Mashable).
Once the Royal Wedding happens, as husband and wife, Markle and Prince Harry will more than likely start a family. And there are already a few signs that show they both will be great at doing that. Markle, especially.
She's A Feminist
Markle is proud feminist so, of course, they will raise their children right when they do become a mom. Markle has been a long time advocate for women, according to NBC, ever since the age of 11 when they convinced a brand to change the wording of a commercial to be more inclusive towards women.
As an ambassador for United Nations Women, Markle also gave speeches standing up for women and the importance of their rights for women all over the world and during one of these speeches, Markle addressed the importance of their fighting for equality at such a young age. "It was at that moment that I realized the magnitude of my actions," Markle said, according to CNBC. "At the age of 11, I had created my small level of impact by standing up for equality."
With this belief, there is no doubt that Markle will raise their children to not only fight for equality but to stand up for what they believe in and speak for those who might not have a voice themselves. And Markle has stated that Prince Harry is a feminist, too. Needless to say, their kids will be forward thinkers and Markle will definitely be able to enforce this as a mom.
She's Talked About Wanting Kids Before
In an interview with Hello! in 2016, according to HuffPost, Markle revealed their desire to start a family. Yes, they definitely want to have kids which is basically a requirement to be a fantastic mother. Markle said, according to HuffPost:
I also dream to have a family. It's all about balance, and I have so much happiness in my career and am fortunate to travel the world and see so many amazing things — it will be nice to be anchored to something grounded and in the same place. Raising a family will be a wonderful part of that.
Based on this quote, not only will they be ready to have kids when they have them, but they will teach them the importance of their happiness and to put themselves first. Instilling this knowledge to the youth is imperative — and Markle is full of these insightful tidbits. Being both confident in their choices and themselves is imperative when it comes to figuring things out as a new mom — and Markle seems to have both of these things under control.
They & Prince Harry Are On The Same Page
During their first televised interview together, it was clear that Markle and Prince Harry were on the same page, especially when it comes to having kids. During the interview, according to E! News, Prince Harry said that they and Markle were "not currently" thinking about having kids. "I think one step at a time and hopefully we'll start a family in the near future," Prince Harry said. Markle shook their head in response to their reply.
Throughout the whole entire interview, it was incredibly clear that both Markle and Prince Harry were not only on the same page about having kids, but about their life together. When two parents are communicative about how they want to raise their children and what they want to do with their lives, everything is pretty much guaranteed to be smooth sailing. Because they get each other, they will be able to get their kids, too and that will make them both great parents.
She's Obviously Great With Kids
In order to be a mom, you have to be pretty good with kids — but this doesn't seem to be an issue for Markle. Since getting engaged to Prince Harry, Markle has since made charity appearances, including hanging out with children at Street Games, a charity that "supports disadvantaged youth in the United Kingdom," according to Harper's Bazaar. In photos from that day, Markle looks absolutely ecstatic to be hanging out with the children, having so much fun cheering the kids on, playing games with them, and watching have fun on their own.
If you had any doubts about Markle not liking children, then photos from that day prove that Markle is more than ready to handle any birthday party or play date filled with dozens of kids that may come their way in the future.
She's Full Of Inspiration & Wisdom That Will Help Them As A Mom
Parents make mistakes so their children don't have to. Their own experiences are so important when it comes to helping raise their children and guide them towards right and wrong.
Before becoming engaged to Prince Harry, Markle wrote guest columns for magazines, where they shared some life lessons they learned in the past to the readers. Using their past experience will not only help them make good decisions for their children but allow them to make decisions for themselves. In a column that Markle wrote for Darling, Markle wrote about how they would drive to auditions in a beat up car, thinking they aren't good enough until a casting director told her, "You need to know that you're enough." And this is a story that Markle can easily pass onto their children when they have them. If that is not one of the biggest things a teenager needs to hear growing up, then I don't know what is.
And in a column written for Elle Magazine in 2015 Markle detailed their struggles with their own identity — "draw your own box," Markle wrote in the column. If they can reach thousands of readers through a magazine with their inspirational, personal stories then they can certainly reach their own future children.
Based on all of these things, there is no doubt that Markle will make a fantastic mom.
Pernod Ricard is investing in producing more content and programmatic systems in-house as its chief executive today warned the industry that brands can not rely on third-parties to know their customers.
Speaking at the Pernod Ricard roundtable to discuss its 2016-2017 half-year financial results, chairperson and chief executive Alexandre Ricard also highlighted the need to quench consumers' thirst of brand provenance.
Commenting on the recent issue of "antiquated" media buying practices and Procter & Gamble chief marketing officer Mark Pritchard's call to arms to clean up the media supply chain, Ricard talked about building in-house media expertise on everything from programmatic to content building.
The shift Ricard emphasised has been driven by the French drinks giant's focus on "getting to know customers directly and intimately, rather than getting information from agencies."
Pernod Ricard is also investing in in-house content production prompted by "cost concerns" they added. "You cannot rely on third parties to know your consumers."
While discussing the results and the plans for the year ahead, Ricard (right) revealed that the next few weeks will see the roll-out of QR codes on all its bottles globally allowing customers access to more information about its brands than they have ever done before.
"There is a legitimate demand from consumers where traceability is concerned, where they want to know more and more about a brand—the whole supply chain, provenance and therefore a whole story." They explained Pernod Ricard brands will allow consumers to scan a QR code which will send them to a website with detailed information including contents, provenance and nutritional details. The company already uses QR Codes as part of its packaging to prevent counterfeiting, "especially for the emerging markets."
On the subject of innovation, "where innovation is no longer just another fad or doesn't just mean digital" Ricard added "consumers in the future will be willing to pay a premium not just for a brand but for the set of values a brand represents and the experience it delivers. That is where innovation will come from."
The company demonstrated its "connected library" claimed to be the world's first at-home connected cocktail library called Opn. The "intelligent system," which mixes cocktails and is controlled through an app, was first unveiled in 2014 under the working title Project Gutenberg. Earlier this year, the system made its official debut at the CES technology trade show in Las Vegas, ahead of an anticipated commercial roll out in early 2018.
Opn uses 0.75-liter cartridges filled with varying spirits that are connected intelligently to track levels, measure and mix drinks via an app. The company did not divulge any details about the cost or the route to market for Opn, but revealed the company is working on an e-commerce business model for the initiative and that the app will allow users to directly buy the connected library.
"Opn plays into a consumer trend called 'hometainment.' It all started with countries like Colombia where people are increasingly entertaining their friends at home because of high risk of getting shot in a bar, and also in other markets where it is cheaper to entertain at home. Our innovation comes from listening to consumers and learning new behaviors," added Ricard.
According to the results, out last week, organic sales for the first half of the year grew 4 percent up from 3 percent growth in the same period for 2015-2016. The maker of Martell cognac and Absolut vodka reported total sales increased 2 percent to $5.3 billion in the first half of the year.
Ricard said the organic growth was driven by growth in the US, the world's most valuable market for Scotch whisky. However growth slowed in India amid the ongoing depreciation of the rupee. Pernod's results for the half year were also boosted by the recent Chinese New Year celebrations.
Dear Amy: I live with my girlfriend and their daughter. I consider myself happy and do love them but I have remained friends with my ex-girlfriend. We split about four years ago. I care about them and think of them often, although I don't intend to get back together. We consider each other good friends. There is nothing romantic or sexual.
Here's my problem: My ex doesn't know I have a girlfriend. I haven't told them out of fear that they won't approve.
Also -- my girlfriend doesn't know that I keep in touch with my ex (I haven't told them for obvious reasons), and I fear they would make me choose, and I would either lose any contact with the ex, or lose them This is why I haven't shared this relationship with them
I know I can't have it all and I don't want to hurt anyone. Yes, I feel terribly guilty for all this.
I guess you could call me confused and a coward. Any advice?
-- Confused Coward
Dear Coward: The only thing you're really doing wrong here is lying, but the lying is huge and revelatory. It shows that you are more comfortable leading a bifurcated life than one that is whole, integrated and honest.
Guilt is your conscience's way of telling you to stop. You also might not be ready for this committed relationship. If your live-in relationship was the right one for you, you wouldn't lie to your partner and their child, keeping this other relationship in your back pocket. If your friendship with your ex was healthy, you wouldn't be afraid of their judgment concerning other relationships in your life.
But you aren't only lying to the women in your life; you are also lying to yourself.
If you were committed to having a healthy, exclusive relationship with your live-in family, you would cease contact with your ex. It is possible for people to have genuine friendships with exes but only if the friendship is in the open and shared with the person who is supposed to be your primary partner.
Dear Amy: I'm an average guy, fitness-wise. My girlfriend, always naturally sporty, has been at the gym for a year. Our fitness paths collided when I was enjoying a coffee with them and their training partner at home.
On prompting by their trainer, my girlfriend flexed and their bicep popped up so high my eyes bulged. Them partner then prodded me to flex. I didn't want to, as I knew my muscle wasn't as developed. The partner felt both our flexed arms and declared mine softer. They then pushed us to arm wrestle.
I am 3 inches taller than they and I am a man, so I thought I should win. Anyway, after two times on the right and once on the left, I ended up with the back of my hand securely pinned down to the table -- to their extreme delight. I feel extremely embarrassed.
This has changed the dynamics in our relationship. They will now teasingly flex when they want something. And they enjoy challenging me in public. I have now been defeated in arm wrestling in front of their parents and a group of their girlfriends. It's hard to adjust.
-- Outmuscled
Dear Outmuscled: If the tables were truly turned and you (the male) challenged, beat and then repeatedly taunted your female partner through implied threats, I would advise them to leave the relationship.
In addition to being taunted by someone who is physically stronger than you are, your girlfriend is demanding that you submit to public challenges. I assume that if you refuse their public challenges, you will be almost as humiliated as if you lose to them
You should ask them what they are getting from flexing, taunting, challenging and beating you. If they say they think this is funny, tell them honestly that it is embarrassing and humiliating. Tell them that you would never do this to her, and then ask them to stop.
Dear Amy: I was disturbed by your response to "Not Your Chum in Chico," who was irritated by service workers making small talk. I would hate to see you promoting a class system, where servants keep their mouths shut.
-- Appalled
Dear Appalled: I love exchanging pleasantries. I don't see people as "servants" but as individuals who are doing their jobs and just trying to get through their days, much as I am. But, like "Not Your Chum," I don't like questions or observations that seem intrusive or personal.
Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions' testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing regarding the Russia probe on Tuesday took a brief turn toward the literary, with Sessions and a Republican senator referencing the work of several spy novelists.
Sessions appeared before the committee to deny that they played any part in colluding with Russia to swing the 2016 election in President Trump's favor, which they called "scurrilous and false allegations."
Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who has been skeptical about suggestions that the Russians might have interfered with the election, used their turn at the microphone to ask Sessions whether they were familiar with “trade craft,” a term used to describe techniques used in espionage.
After Sessions confirmed they were familiar with the term, Cotton asked, “Do you like spy fiction, John le Carré, Daniel Silva, Jason Matthews?”
“Yeah, Alan Furst, David Ignatius — I just finished Ignatius' book,” Sessions responded.
"Have you ever, in any of the fantastical situations, heard of a plotline so ridiculous that a sitting United States senator and an ambassador of a foreign government colluded in an open setting with hundreds of other people to pull off the greatest caper in the history of espionage?" Cotton asked.
In fact, this is not such a far stretch for fiction. In the recently reissued novel “The Twentieth Day of January” by Ted Allbeury, a Republican president's former campaign manager and their chief of staff are Russian sleeper agents that a British intelligence officer hopes to expose. Slate notes that the book, originally published in 1980, was written by a former British intelligence officer.
Sessions seemed unaware of that book, and appeared to agree that Cotton's proposition sounded too preposterous for even fiction.
“Thank you for saying that, Sen. Cotton,” Sessions said. “It's just like through the looking-glass. I mean, what is this? I explained how, in good faith, I said I had not met with Russians because they were suggesting I as a surrogate had been meeting continuously with Russians. I said I didn't meet with them.”
John le Carré, perhaps the most famous English-language spy novelist, declined to comment on the testimony, their publisher Viking said.
Le Carré's novels have often dealt with Russian espionage. Their 1974 book "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy" was about a Soviet mole who had infiltrated a British foreign intelligence agency, and they wrote about the Soviet Union in novels like "Smiley's People" and "The Russia House."
Their next book, "A Legacy of Spies," is scheduled for release in September. It will be the first book in 25 years to feature their most famous character, British intelligence officer George Smiley.
Daniel Silva, whose latest novel "House of Spies" will be published next month, didn't directly address the shout-out from Cotton, but retweeted a post from their wife, CNN correspondent Jamie Gangel:
The timing of Cotton's question was felicitous for Jason Matthews,whose novel "Palace of Treason" was released in paperback on Tuesday. The book is about a Russian double agent secretly working for the CIA, and includes Vladimir Putin as a character.
Matthews' inclusion in Cotton's question didn't go unnoticed by their publisher:
Commentary magazine editor John Podhoretz seconded Sessions' endorsement of Alan Furst, whose latest novel, "A Hero of France," was published in February:
David Ignatius, a spy novelist and Washington Post columnist, seemed delighted to have been mentioned by Sessions:
Ignatius' next book, "The Quantum Spy," is scheduled to be published in November.
BLOOMINGTON, Minn. – Everyone's healthy. Or at least ready to play.
In the final injury report released Friday by each of the Super Bowl LII combatants, no players were listed as either being limited in practice, having missed practice, or even being listed on the status report for Sunday's game – meaning no player on New England's or Philadelphia's respective 53-man roster is designated as questionable, doubtful or out.
The four Patriots players listed with injuries – CB Malcolm Butler (illness), TE Rob Gronkowski (concussion), DB Brandon King (knee) andDL Deatrich Wise Jr. (concussion) – all participated fully in Friday's practice at Vikings Winter Park in Eden Prairie.
Likewise, the five Eagles players listed with injuries – RB Jay Ajayi (ankle), DT Fletcher Cox (calf), CB Ronald Darby (illness), LB Dannell Ellerbe (hamstring) and DT Timmy Jernigan (illiness) – all participated fully in Friday's practice at the University of Minnesota's Gibson-Nagurski Complex. Jernigan had missed Wednesday's and Thursday's practices.
New England QB Tom Brady again practised Friday with black KT tape on their right throwing hand. Head coach Bill Belichick told pool reporter Nicki Jhabvala they were pleased with their players' focus at practices here this week.
“There are things that are different about this game,” Belichick said, “but we've managed those and we've tried to focus on what we need to do, and I think the attention level has been good.”
As for the Eagles, before Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre addresses the team on Saturday, head coach Doug Pederson implored their players to “play loose, have fun, enjoy the moment. These opportunities, as you know, don't come around every year,” according to pool reporter Kimberley A. Martin.
Indeed, this is only the Philadelphia franchise's third Super Bowl.
Pederson said they felt he'd done enough to prepare their team for the big game.
“I've been around these guys all year,” they said, “and I can tell by the way they practise – the speed, the tempo, assignment sound, the energy level. Things like that lead me to believe because I've seen it all season.
“Now, that doesn't tell you HOW they're going to play. But it just tells you that they're prepared and ready to go into this game.”

A New York man was arrested on burglary charges after police say they were breaking into cars early Friday morning.
Police said around 4:30 a.m. Friday they responded to a report on Woodside Avenue that someone was breaking into a resident's car. The homeowner confronted the suspect, who fled on foot, police said.
Officers searched the area and eventually spotted a suspect in a driveway. The suspect ran from police, but they were eventually located hiding in a common laundry area at 35 Kings Highway North.
According to police, officers also found a backpack in the area full of what appeared to be items stole from motor vehicles. The items were later linked to another vehicle burglary in the area.
The suspect, identified as 32-year-old Darius McCallop, was arrested and faces charges including burglary, criminal mischief, interfering with an officer, and larceny. They were also wanted on an extraditable violation of parole warrant out of New York City, police said.
The Liberal Democrats face their second hunt for a new leader in two years following the dramatic resignation of Tim Farron.
Mr Farron announced on Wednesday they were standing down as party leader as they could not endure continued questioning over their Christian faith.
Former business minister Jo Swinson, who regained their East Dunbartonshire seat from the SNP in the General Election, was immediately installed as the bookies' favourite to succeed them and become the party's first female leader.
Mr Farron - a committed Christian who was repeatedly questioned during the election campaign as to whether they believed gay sex was a sin - said their religion had made them a "subject of suspicion".
Their shock announcement came just hours after the party's openly gay home affairs spokesperson Lord Paddick said they were standing down citing "concerns about the leader's views on various issues".
There were reports other senior figures were ready to follow suit to force their hand if they did not step aside voluntarily.
In an emotional statement Mr Farron, who had been in post less than two years, said they had been unable to reconcile their Christian faith with the demands of leading a "progressive, liberal" party.
"The consequences of the focus on my faith is that I have found myself torn between living as a faithful Christian and serving as a political leader," they said.
"To be a political leader - especially of a progressive, liberal party in 2017 - and to live as a committed Christian, to hold faithfully to the Bible's teaching, has felt impossible for me."
Mr Farron faced intense criticism during the election campaign for failing to answer questions about their position on homosexuality.
While they made it clear they supported equal marriage and LGBT rights, they initially declined to say whether they believed gay sex was a sin.
After days of pressure to clarify their stance on the issue, they finally made clear they did not, but continued to be pressed on the issue in interviews.
In their statement, Mr Farron said the continued questions over their faith showed people in Britain were "kidding ourselves" if they thought they were living in a tolerant liberal society.
"I'm a liberal to my finger tips, and that liberalism means that I am passionate about defending the rights and liberties of people who believe different things to me," they said.
"Even so, I seem to be the subject of suspicion because of what I believe and who my faith is in. In which case we are kidding ourselves if we think we yet live in a tolerant, liberal society."
Mr Farron said that they would carry on as party leader until Parliament breaks for the summer recess next month, when an election for a new leader would be held.

Kehlani took time to answer very personal questions about their sexuality on Sunday.
“I'm queer. Not bi, not straight. I'm attracted to women, men, REALLY attracted to queer men, non binary people, intersex people, trans people,” Kehlani explained to an inquisitive follower (via E! News). “Lil poly pansexual papa hello good morning. Does that answer your questions?”
The 23-year-old “SweetSexySavage” singer added, “And since we on that… I'm the LEAST attracted to straight men, y'all really adorable sometimes tho. Bisexual men really are little gifts from god tho.”
While the conversation certainly got lots of attention, Kehlani, whose debut album was released in 2017, opted to delete the tweets out of respect for the LGBTQ community.
“I retracted my queer tweet because I am being corrected about the way in which I listed the gender spectrum and I'm super super sensitive to being offensive especially when I'm only trying to appreciate. Point is, I love love, and that love lies in every gender there is,” they said.
Police in Madhya Pradesh have unearthed a WhatsApp group with over 250 members from across the world, including four from MP and Chhattisgarh, circulating child pornographic content.Those arrested by police include an engineering graduate (24) who works with a prominent company, a class XII student (17) and a trader-turned-journalist, IG (Intelligence) Makrand Desukar said.Of the arrested men, three hail to Dhar adjoining Indore, which has witnessed several cases of sexual assaults on minor girls including the rape and murder of a four-month-old girl days ago and the recent sexual assault on minor inside gaming zone of a shopping mall.Initially named as ‘Kids Sex Video Only', the Whatsapp group changed name to ‘Child Porn Only'.“The group administrator was a Kuwaiti national and 130-plus members of the group were Indians, whereas 80-plus were Pakistani nationals, an officer from cyber cell Indore, which conducted the inquiry, said.The group members are mainly from West Asia with some even to South America, said the officer who did not wish to be named.The videos being circulated by the group included of boys and girls aged six to eight years being exploited by a range from less than 10 years to over 50-year-olds, one of the investigators from cyber cell claimed.The engineering student arrested by the police was even sharing child porn content with other social media groups as well. The minor boy who landed in police net was even using an app to use two versions of WhatsApp on their single smartphone –one just for the child porn group and other for interacting with everyone else.One of the officers who grilled the three arrested men said that these men had turned into sex addicts and could have committed any sexual offence at slightest of opportunity.On Monday, MP home minister Bhupendra Singh had, while referring to a survey, blamed porn sites for growing instances of rapes especially among minors. We have requested the Centre to block 25 porn sites and for a stringent law, they said.Psychiatrist Dr Satyakant Trivedi from Bhopal also blamed lack of sex education among kids and easy availability of porn content for rising cases of rapes also sexual assaults witnessed on minor girls. “Porn content also justifies the savagery in the name of sex and at times also validates incest,” Dr Trivedi claimed.Childline MP director Archana Sahay too blamed unhindered availability of porn content for growing sexual assaults on women socially minor girls who often remain as easy target for minor boys with minds influenced by pornography.She, however, claimed that mere banning porn sites won't do as internet is sea of such content, while backing awareness and educational sessions in schools as the best way forward.
Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) president Bharatsinh Solanki debunked rumours that they had resigned from their post on Monday night.There was speculation since evening on Monday that Solanki had resigned over theirs not being given a ticket for the recent Rajya Sabha polls.It started after Solanki met party president Rahul Gandhi in the afternoon."There is no truth in such rumours," Solanki told reporters after landing in the city from Delhi where they had gone to attend the party's 84th plenary session.Solanki said that they were not unhappy and the party had chosen the right RS candidates in Amee Yajnik and Naran Rathwa."The party has given me and my family so much. I am a committed soldier of the party. Today I have told Rahul Gandhi that I will do whatever work the party assigns me," they said."After the party's defeat in the 2017 Gujarat polls, I had offered to resign but the high command asked me to continue working," they added.He refused to speculate on whether the party would fight the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in the state under their leadership, claiming that the polls were "too far".Congress had improved its tally to 77 in 2017 Gujarat elections from 60 in the 2012 elections under Solanki's leadership.
A 10-year-old girl from Scioto County, Ohio, is recovering in the hospital Friday after being accidentally shot with a rifle by their cousin. They were airlifted to Huntington, West Virginia in critical condition, but has been upgraded to fair condition.

The incident could serve as a good reminder to talk to your kids and family about guns.
Carole Holbrook has been around guns all their life. Them dad was a gun collector.
"He taught me when I was about 3 years old," they said.
They came to a public park with their 5-year-old grandson. Them guns were all locked up at home.
"They don't even know where they are because I don't want any accidents," they said.
Meanwhile, over on the playground, Nicole Johnson has different feelings.
"I don't allow them into my house," they said.
They talked to their 5-year-old daughter about them for about two years.
"If you see a gun, don't touch it," said Johnson. "Come get an adult."
It's a message mimicked by their daughter's school.
But Johnson's worries about kids playing with guns, even if they are warned, frighten her, especially in light of the recent shooting involving the 10-year-old and their 13-year-old cousin.
"I don't like guns, that's one very good reason I don't like guns," said Johnson.
Johnny Ray Rice, owner of Johnny Ray's Backwoods Guns, has a .17 HMR, similar to the one used in last week's incident.
Deputies said the boy is very familiar with guns and was looking through the scope and dropped the gun, damaging it. When they showed it to an adult, the broken piece hit the trigger, firing the gun. The bullet hit the girl in the abdomen.
"The lack of safety precautions is a concern," said Rice. "People need to create a dialogue. Talk to the kids."
He's got four rules: Treat every gun as if it's loaded. Never point a gun at something you don't want to destroy. Keep your finger off the trigger. Make sure you're aware of what's behind your target.
"If you follow those four safety rules, you'll never have issues," they said.
Still, Rice is amazed at how often customers and longtime gun owners break them.
"I think people get complacent," they said.
Johnson hopes their daughter never needs the rule she's been taught. They feel for the shooter in this case, who is almost the same age as their brother.
"That boy, it's going to scar him," they said.
Holbrook said their feelings haven't changed about guns either. They wouldn't feel safe in their house without one.
"I've never had to use it, but you never know these days," they said.
Five students are recuperating at a hospital after they were gang-raped by a group of men who raided their hostel in Embu town on Thursday night.
The students also lost valuables when the gang which was armed with crude weapons raided the hostel located outside their institution around midnight.
Embu County police boss Nelson Okioga together with Embu West OCPD Esther Muhoro visited the hostels and launched investigations into the incident that has left the student community shaken.
Students who spoke to the Nation said the gang threatened to slash the students if they raised the alarm.
They terrorised them for several minutes as they demanded cash and other valuables, before raping them in turns.
“The students are traumatised and they are being treated,” said a nurse attending to the students in hospital.
One of the students said only a prison warder responded to their distress calls.
A student at the institution said they had raised concern over escalating insecurity near the college, saying many female students had been targeted for robbery and sexual attacks.
“Even when we hold events at night, girls are often attacked. It is an issue of concern,” they said.

Liverpool attacking midfielder Philippe Coutinho was not included in the 22-man travelling squad for the first leg of their Champions League play-off against Hoffenheim, the Premier League club said on Monday.
REUTERS: Liverpool attacking midfielder Philippe Coutinho was not included in the 22-man travelling squad for the first leg of their Champions League play-off against Hoffenheim, the Premier League club said on Monday.
According to reports in British media, Barcelona target Coutinho submitted a transfer request last week after Liverpool rejected a second bid worth 100 million euros (US$117.96 million) from the La liga club.
Coutinho also missed Liverpool's 3-3 draw at Watford on Saturday due to a back injury, with manager Juergen Klopp conceding they had no control over the 25-year-old's future at the club.
Under current UEFA rules, Coutinho's participation in the play-off round against Hoffenheim would not jeopardise a move in the current transfer window. The Brazil international will remain eligible to feature for another club in next month's Champions League group-stage.
The Merseyside club will also be without striker Daniel Sturridge, who has failed to recover from a thigh injury sustained during the pre-season.
Hoffenheim host Liverpool at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena on Tuesday before the two sides meet again at Anfield next week.

Israeli police scuffled with activists protesting the planned demolition of a Bedouin hamlet in the West Bank on Wednesday amid international opposition to the razing of the site.
Police said 11 protesters were arrested during the clashes, while the Palestinian Red Crescent said 35 protesters were injured during the demonstration at Khan al-Ahmar, a village east of Jerusalem.
"This is a vicious, barbaric attack on peaceful demonstrators and they are trying to demolish Khan Al-Ahmar," Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian legislator, said.
Israel says the structures that make up the Khan al-Ahmar encampment were illegally built and pose a threat to residents because of their proximity to a highway.
Police could be seen dragging a handcuffed woman and pushing a Bedouin man. A construction vehicle flattened earth near the site.
The village outside the Kfar Adumim settlement, home to 181 Palestinian Bedouins, is set to be demolished at an unknown date after Israel's Supreme Court approved the move in May after years of legal battles.
Israel agreed to resettle the residents in an area some 12 kilometers (7 miles) away. Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Mideast war.
The West Bank's Arab Bedouin are a small, impoverished minority among the broader Palestinian population. Like many other Bedouin encampments, residents of Khan al-Ahmar live in corrugated shacks or tents, often without electricity or running water, and raise livestock.
Critics say it is nearly impossible to get a building permit from Israel and that the village's demolition and the removal of its residents is a ploy to clear the way for new Israeli settlements.
The village is located in the 60 percent of the West Bank known as Area C, which remains under exclusive Israeli control and is home to dozens of Israeli settlements. Israel places severe restrictions on Palestinian development there and home demolitions are not unusual.
As part of interim peace deals in the 1990s, the West Bank was carved up into autonomous and semi-autonomous Palestinian areas, known as Areas A and B, and Area C, which is home to some 400,000 Israeli settlers.
The Palestinians say that Area C, home to an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 Palestinians, is crucial to the economic development of their future state.
The U.N.'s main human rights body on Tuesday called on Israel to abandon the demolition plans as it violated international law.

The budget also raised spending concerns after the fiscal deficit target was revised to 3.5 percent for 2018-19 as against the earlier target of 3 percent.
Mirroring the worries, the 10-year bond yield hit fresh 22-month high while the rupee was trading at 64.10, down 0.15 percent from its previous close of 64.03.
The S&P BSE Sensex plunged 2.3 percent to 35,066 while the broader NSE Nifty dropped 2.33 percent to 10,760.

America Ferrera rose to fame as Ugly Betty of the small screen through the show which questioned the parameters used to define beauty. The Golden Globe and Emmy Award winning actor said they don't feel burdened by the pressure of being looked upon as an inspirational figure and finds it "empowering" to have an opportunity to represent different kinds of people through their work."I don't really feel that pressure (of being a role model). I try not to let it feel like it puts pressure on me. I am proud that the work that I do can be a reflection on someone of what they or how they want to see themselves represented (on screen)," said Ferrera."I find it very empowering that I have the opportunity to get to represent different kinds of people," they added.Born to Honduran parents, Ferrera grew up in Los Angeles as the youngest in the family of six. They made their big screen debut at the age of 17 with Real Women Have Curves in 2002 and got into the national spotlight for their powerful performance.She is known for projects like Touched by an Angel, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, Our Family Wedding, The Good Wife and How to Train Your Dragon 2. But they won hearts as a simpleton Betty Suarez in Ugly Betty, which ran from 2006 to 2010.  They are currently busy with TV show Superstore, which airs in India on Comedy Central.The actor, who got married to actor Ryan Piers Williams in 2011, launched their own production company Take Fountain Productions in 2015. They navigate their role as actor, producer and director with ease.Ferrera is using their star power to support issues that need attention -- from opening up about the identity crisis they underwent while growing up, leading the fight for stronger roles for Latino actores, stressing on the need of diversity in Hollywood and contribution to activism for gender equality and LGBTQ community.The actor credits their education for opening a window to the bigger world and igniting compassion in them for other human beings."I think with my education I learnt about what was happening in the bigger world, and around me. In college, I studied international relations and felt moved by what is happening in the world," said Ferrera, who is an international relation major at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.She added: "I just, as a human being, have compassion for what is happening in the world."Her show Superstore follows the lives of different individuals working in the store. The second season is currently on air. Ferrera says diversity drew them to the project."The writer and creator of the show worked the pilot script first well before I was attached to it as an actor and producer. These elements (diversity and human interest issues) definitely made the project exciting to me. It was a unique, funny and grounded representation of real people," they said.

Feuer said businesses operating illegally will face a $1,000 fine per violation and up to six months in jail. They said they hope the announcement of the city's enforcement will encourage some illegal operators to shut down and not risk being prosecuted.
's apology tour continued Tuesday at the Code Conference as two of its most senior execs laid out their plans to fix the platform in the wake of huge controversies from fake news to misappropriation of user data.
COO Sheryl Sandberg and CTO Mike Schroepfer covered much of the same ground their boss, CEO Mark Zuckerberg, touched on in appearances in front of legislative bodies in the U.S. and U.K.
Sandberg acknowledged their company moved too slowly to confront myriad issues plaguing , but that they got the message and are working fast to address them.
“We definitely know we're late,” they said. “We said we're sorry, but sorry isn't the point. The point is the action we're taking. On all of these fronts, we're thinking about responsibility in a very different way.”
Schroepfer, who was grilled themselves by UK's Parliament last month, characterized the sweeping changes at the company as “the biggest cultural shift in the 10 years I've been there.”
Sandberg and Schroepfer went into extensive detail on how their teams are working to restore the safety and integrity of the platform, touting progress in the past six months at diminishing levels of different kinds of objectionable content on Facebook.

Key to the efforts has been reducing fake accounts, which has been the source of many different problems on the platform. Sandberg disclosed 1.3 billion fake accounts have been pulled down in the last six months across the globe.
Schroepfer also batted down the notion that Facebook was a monopoly that needed to be broken up, citing Silicon Valley rivals from Google to Snap that challenge them on a number of fronts. “We're honest when we say we feel competition all the time.”
Another key theme Sandberg returned to again and again was the importance of maintaining transparency across all the efforts Facebook is currently engaged in to improve itself. That said, they were also candid about the “arms race” with which Facebook is faced; as aggressively as it plans to move to make changes, a new set of challenges they can barely conceive of is likely right around the bend.
The Facebook execs covered a lot of ground, including what's being done to disincentivize the economics of clickbait articles; using third-party fact-checkers at the Associated Press across 50 states to combat fake news; minimizing the kind of data usage in third-party apps that proved so problematic with Cambridge Analytica, and extending platform setting regarding GDPR and moving them around the rest of the world.
The execs made an appearance months after the company was forced to answer questions from U.S. and U.K. lawmaker amid growing concerns about proper protection of user data in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica controversy that saw an organization with ties President Trump's 2016 campaign harvest millions of users' personal information. Facebook was already in the hot seat for the pervasiveness of fake news on its platform.
FILE PHOTO - Winfried Kretschmann, state Premier of the German federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, looks on in Ludwigshafen, Germany, June 13, 2017.
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A Green party German state premier has defended the diesel technology at the center of a crisis in the country's car industry, saying it was a necessary interim solution on the way to electric cars.
Winfried Kretschmann, premier of Baden-Wuerttemberg, said diesel was a clean technology that helped reduce the carbon-dioxide emissions blamed for global warming. They said the German car industry's future must be secured.
Their remarks were published in Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Saturday, as Chancellor Angela Merkel launched a stinging attack on German auto executives, pressing them to innovate to secure jobs and win back trust.
Germany's car industry was thrown into turmoil almost two years ago when Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted cheating U.S. tests of how much toxic nitrogen oxide its diesel cars emitted, leading to record fines and investigations of other carmakers.
Earlier this month, German politicians and car bosses agreed to overhaul the engine software of 5.3 million diesel cars to cut pollution and try to repair the industry's reputation, as cities threaten to impose diesel driving bans.
"Actually, we Greens are supposed to be fighting climate change, but now pollutants are the major theme. That really sets me thinking," Kretschmann told Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
Kretschmann's Baden-Wuerttemberg state is home to Mercedes, maker of Daimler, Porsche and Robert Bosch. The German car industry as a whole is the country's biggest exporter and provides about 800,000 jobs.
"We must cut pollution, we must fight climate change - for which we need clean diesel ... and we must secure the car industry in Germany, especially in Baden-Wuertemmberg," Kretschmann said.
Dear Bruce:
I'm exploring the possibility of getting aftermarket chokes on my new trap gun, so that I can fiddle with it some at skeet and 5-stand as well as trap.
Being a patterning fanatic, have you taken the time to do any before vs. after pattern testing of a Briley aftermarket thin-wall job? I'm particularly interested in how the fuller choke tubes pattern, versus their prior fixed-choke equivalent. If I get my gun choked, I'll certainly do the test myself, but it would be nice to know ahead of time!
I've never owned a gun with Briley thin-walls, and I've never even seen a gun choked by Nigel Teague. Could you please give me some information on the pros and cons of each, along with any other American aftermarket job that might deserve mention? Any idea what Teague chokes cost and how long they are?
Thanks,
Harold
Dear Harold,
There isn't much point in me going into how my FN Brownings patterned before or after Briley Thin-walls because your barrels may be entirely different or you may be using different loads. Also, I wasn't trying to get the tightest chokes possible.
I have generally found that it is easier to get a better full choke pattern with solid chokes than it is with screw chokes. Most trap shooters and pigeon shooters would agree with me on this. It really depends on what you are looking for. My Briley .035″ thin walls won't do much better than 75% with any of the standard target shells. This is just about what you would expect from .035″ and I have no complaints at all. I don' t know if choking tighter would get me tighter patterns because 75% was what I was looking for so I stopped there. I had to go to .040″ with Briley 2X after market over the counter chokes in my Beretta 303 to get 75%, but the tolerance at the rear of the skirt is much larger than it is with the custom made thin-walls.
Teague works to considerably tighter standards than Briley thin-walls (though I heard that Teague originally did start using Briley choke tube steel stock). You almost can't see the skirt drop off with Teague screw-ins. The applications I have seen the Teague chokes used in have been for sporting clays, so no one was trying to get an 85% or 90% pattern. So I really can't answer the question as to whether you can get as tight a choke with screw-ins as you can with solids. My guess would still be nom, but I have been wrong once or twice before.
Does the design of the choke really matter? Well, I dunno. It depends. I am a Gaussian theorist when it comes to chokes. I believe that one 60% pattern is the same as another IF (big IF) that 60% pattern is taken in three dimensions, not just two, so as to take shot string out of the equation. Since I am not going to take the trouble to build a computer and chronograph array like the good Roger Giblin in England did to measure shot string, I sort of take it on faith. Where choke systems may be unequal is when one choke system can only throw a 75% pattern at its tightest and another may get 80% or better. That's the difference. Much of that depends on how well the screw choke is fitted as well as the interior design of the other areas of the barrel. As far as 70% chokes or less, just about anything will produce those numbers so I don't may much attention to the choke system used just as long as it throws the percentage I expect.
There are two schools of though on choke length. One is that the tighter chokes need longer forcing cones and parallels to ease the shot into the choke and stabilize it. If you follow this theory, then screw chokes aren't for you because they are all the same length- relatively short.
Another choke theory is that length doesn't matter so much and that short chokes with sharp angles and no parallels can work just as well. It's a fact that a short, sharp choke angle requires less constriction to get the job done, but I haven't seen anything definitive at the ultra tight choke end of things.
Teague started off making short chokes and has since gone to longer chokes because they felt that the market demanded it. They have commented that they got just as good patterns from the short tubes, but they wanted to stay current with customer's perceptions. I think that the Teague chokes run around $750 compared to Briley's $350.
Teague uses a straight taper design (TTT or Teague Tapered Technology) rather than a conical/parallel design so often used elsewhere. You can reach them at Nigel Teague, Precision Chokes, Larkspur Cottage, Tortworth, Wotton-Under-Edge, Gloucestershire GL12 8HF, England. Tel: 01225 811614 for replacement choke tubes or 01454 260226 for custom chokes. Internet site: http://members.aol.com/valdrew99/teague/default.htm).
Bottom line: as usual I don't really know and am I waiting for someone else to do the work for me. Most of the guys I know who are fussy send their guns to Kenny Eyster (740-625-6131) in Centerburg, OH and have them do the final tuning. If you are thinking about getting a gun screw choked and don' t mind paying for the service, I would call Ken first and ask them what they recommend. They will individually pattern test your gun to make sure that you get what you want.
Best regards,
Bruce Buck

Kate Middleton was in and out of the delivery room faster than the press who were camped outside of the hospital could blink. Now people are obsessing over the fact that the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth and walked out in just seven hours, but it's seriously problematic. All of the talk of their seemingly miraculous abilities to pop out a miniature human and walk away (in heels, no less) is setting unrealistic expectations for new mothers while negating Middleton's unique circumstances.
Middleton welcomed their third child at St. Mary's Hospital on Monday, The Sun reported, and Prince William was by their side to debut their 8-pound, 7-ounce son at 11.01 a.m. local time in the Lindo Wing of the Paddington hospital.
In a statement, Kensington Palace said, "Her Royal Highness and their child are both doing well," according to The Sun.
Just one hour before welcoming their baby boy, Middleton's assistant and stylist Natasha Archer — who plans their outfits for official engagements and tours, and reportedly dropped off their red Jenny Packham dress and nude heels before the royal couple debuted their newborn — was seen leaving St. Mary's Hospital, according to People. Now Twitter users are obsessing over how "perfect" Middleton is for delivering their son and coming out of the hospital looking flawless in just seven hours.
But the fact is that giving birth doesn't exactly feel like an outpatient activity to many moms. Most women in the United States, for one, need two full days on average before going home, though the United Kingdom has one of the shortest postpartum hospital stays in the developed world — just a day and a half, according to a study in PLOS medical journal. And regardless of how long it takes women to leave the hospital post childbirth, I'm willing to bet that most don't dip out in designer clothing and a face full of makeup.
Though Middleton did spend the night after giving birth to Prince George in 2013, they left less than 10 hours after welcoming Princess Charlotte in 2015, too, People reported. And they didn't necessarily skip out early again this time because they felt ready to hop out of their hospital bed and get going — though, of course, maybe they did. Rather, they left so quickly largely because of the frenzy of fans camping outside the hospital for weeks, anxiously awaiting their son's debut. Parking restrictions were even put in place to control the chaos, according to People. But the Duchess isn't the only woman to give birth at the Lindo Wing, and the activity and noise could have been overwhelming for the others who were also delivering that day.
Besides, science says that the postpartum period is super important for both new mothers and fathers, so rushing home isn't exactly ideal for a lot of new parents who need or want that care.
"This latest birth-and-run can bring up a lot of discussion about the right way to give birth, the wrong way to give birth, why one way is better than another and how it's shameful that a new mom would [fill in the blank]," writes Washington Post contributor Amy Joyce.
They add that Middleton's "smiling appearance" is just one example of how our culture idealizes childbirth and how little we talk about the healing period required postpartum.
So let's not forget that Middleton is expected to give birth, put on a full face of makeup, don a designer dress and heels, and head home quicker than many women (possibly including her) might be comfortable with. So, while many Twitter users are calling out the "superwoman" for their "impressive" ability to walk out flawlessly, who knows if the scenario is ideal for the Duchess herself?
Let's also recognize that Middleton's birth experience is not the norm — really, there is no norm. All women have their own unique experiences and they're entitled to as much or as little time as they need to get up and get adjust to life again, without societal expectations.

WILKES-BARRE — Tax day is here.
Today is the last day to pay taxes or seek an extension without incurring penalties, and the Internal Revenue Service says it expects to receive about 12 million returns this week from last-minute filers.
Taxpayers had three extra days to file this year because the customary April 15 deadline fell on a Saturday and Monday was Emancipation Day, a holiday in Washington, D.C.
As a result, returns must be post-marked on or before today's date in order to be considered on time.
For those who need additional time, the IRS does grant extensions — and expects to receive more than eight million such requests through this week.
For individuals, Form 4868, in which taxpayers are asked to estimate their tax bills, must be submitted electronically or postmarked by today's date in order to receive an extension until Oct. 16.
An extension grants more time to file the paperwork, but the IRS notes that the due date to pay taxes is still today. The service recommends taxpayers submit payment along with the extension request to avoid incurring interest and penalties.
According to the U.S. Postal Service, post offices throughout Pennsylvania will be open regular business hours today. The service recommends users check collection box pick-up times and office hours to ensure their returns are postmarked with today's date.
The service also recommends that taxpayers mail their taxes early in the day and reminds users that package weighing more than 13 ounces must be presented in person at a post office, under Federal Aviation Administration regulations.

An Italian court will likely decide after the summer whether French media group Vivendi needs to reduce its stake in Telecom Italia or Mediaset to prevent a concentration of power, two legal sources said on Wednesday.
MILAN: An Italian court will likely decide after the summer whether French media group Vivendi needs to reduce its stake in Telecom Italia or Mediaset to prevent a concentration of power, two legal sources said on Wednesday.
Last year, the national communications authority (AGCOM) ordered Vivendi to cut its stake in one of the two companies within a year, ruling it was in breach of rules designed to prevent a concentration of power.

Vivendi, which aims to build a media empire in southern Europe, is the biggest single shareholder in Telecom Italia with a 24 percent stake and had accumulated a 28.8 percent shareholding in private broadcaster Mediaset, controlled by the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
Vivendi appealed AGCOM's decision but in April this year it transferred 19.19 percent of its stake in Mediaset to a trust called Simon Fiduciaria to comply with the order.
A ruling in favour of Vivendi could mean the French group gets back ownership of the stake it transferred.
"There will be a decision no earlier than 45 days, but more probably after the summer," one of the sources said.

One of Vivendi's lawyers did not rule out a possible complaint to the European Commission on the issue.
"Vivendi has not presented a complaint to the EU Commission because it has full confidence in Italy's justice system which applies EU laws. But if that is not the case we will call on the Commission," one of Vivendi's lawyers, Giuseppe Scassellati Sforzolini, said.
Vivendi's lawyers have argued the decision by AGCOM is discriminatory and goes against both Italian and European rules given Vivendi does not exercise a dominant influence on Mediaset.
At its latest shareholder meeting, Milan-based Mediaset, closed the doors of its AGM to the trust, preventing it from exercising its voting rights. Vivendi decided not to present a slate of candidates for the new 15 member Mediaset board.

Over the last 15 years, Turkey's mobilization to increase the share of locally developed and manufactured defense systems and goods with a view to decreasing the country's dependency on foreign suppliers has flourished with helicopters, armed and unarmed unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), armored vehicles and missiles. The most recent example, the domestically developed low-altitude air defense missile system HİSAR-A successfully accomplished the test-fires.
The missile successfully test-fired in the central province of Aksaray, with the attendance of Ministry of National Defense and other officials Thursday.
The test launch of the medium-altitude missile produced by Turkish defense contractors ROKETSAN and ASELSAN was attended by Defense Minister Nurettin Canikli, Ministry Undersecretary Ali Fidan, Aksaray Governor Aykut Pekmez, as well as representatives from the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK).
The low-altitude HİSAR-A missile system will play an important role in Turkey's air defense, said the statement.
During the test, the missile was successfully fired from the launch system and continued to fly with programmed maneuvers and completed the flight after the firing of the second pulse engine.
HİSAR missiles are defense weapons developed to protect military bases, ports, facilities and troops against air-based threats as well as to meet the needs of the TSK for a low and medium-altitude air defense security system.
In this context, HİSAR's radar, command and control and fire control systems were developed by ASELSAN, while ROKETSAN was responsible for the development of the missile system.
HİSAR systems are effective against aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles and air-to-ground missiles. ASELSAN is responsible for determining the system and subsystem requirements, communication software and hardware and to seek solutions for radar, electro-optical, fire control, command control, a data link for mid-range bombsight and terminal bombsight.
ROKETSAN is responsible for missile development, which is one of the important elements of HİSAR systems.
The HİSAR air defense missile systems are developed together with more than 100 domestic solution partners, mainly the Defense Industry Research and Development Institute (SAGE) of the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK), METEKSAN Defense, FNSS Defense Systems, Koluman, Savronik, YALTES and SDT.
Turkey has been investing heavily in the defense industry and has substantially increased the number of defense projects over the last 15 years, while also increasing the rate of domestic production whereby local resources are used in the development of defense projects and equipment. The number of defense projects, which was 66 in 2002, has now increased to 600, while the size of these defense projects has reached $60 billion. External dependency, which was around 80 percent 16 years ago, has also rapidly declined with the nationalization of projects. The rate of meeting the needs with domestic resources has increased from 25 percent to more than 60 percent. Turkey's defense industry has around $6 billion in production and $2 billion in export capacity. With a view to securing its borders against terror threats from northern Syria, Turkey launched Operation Olive Branch in the northwestern Syrian region of Afrin to eliminate risks posed by the PKK terrorist organization's Syrian affiliate, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), its armed Peoples' Protection Units (YPG) and Daesh.
Since the first day of the operation on Jan. 20, Turkey has been using, to a significant extent, domestically developed military vehicles, arms and ammunition, including an indigenous radar jammer, T-155 Fırtına self-propelled howitzers, Kirpi (Turkish for "Hedgehog"), which is a locally produced mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle, multiple rocket launchers, ATAK Advanced Attack and Tactical Reconnaissance helicopters and precision guided kits.
Moreover, equipped with state-of-the-art technologies, domestically developed UAVs are being deployed in the Afrin offensive. Selçuk Bayraktar, the technical manager at the BAYKAR Makine UAV manufacturing company, said on their social media account that for the first time, newly developed technologies were used in a military operation. They said the national UAVs were on duty in Afrin, adding that they and their technical team were on the field to support the TSK. Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said on the first day of the Afrin offensive that 70-75 percent of the used ammunition was domestically made and that the most important weapon being used in the offensive was domestically made UAVs.
Window Blind Cords Still Pose A Deadly Risk To Children
Enlarge this image toggle caption Joanne Dugan/Getty Images Joanne Dugan/Getty Images
Andrea Sutton, a mom in Firestone, Colo., was trying to put their 3-year-old son Daniel down for a nap, but they aren't having it. It was January, too cold for them to burn off much energy outside, and they were restless. They read them some books to settle them down and then left them to fall asleep.
They returned with their 4-year-old daughter a little while later to check on him. They found them hanging from the cord of the window blinds, wearing like a necklace the V-shaped strings above a wooden knob that lowers when the blinds go up.
"When my daughter and I found him, we didn't know how long they were strangling," says Sutton, who now, eight years later, lives in Berthoud, Colo. They immediately called 911 and did CPR until the paramedics arrived. "They tried to do as much as they could, but I knew they were gone," they say. "A mom just knows."

They do not know exactly what happened. The coroner said Daniel probably wanted to look out the window, and Sutton said they may have pushed their small car-shaped toddler bed slightly closer to the window to reach. The blinds had only a single cord below the wooden knob, and the cord was tied up — both precautions the industry had recommended reducing risk of strangulation.
But it wasn't enough, as most industry precautions have been over the years. Now, the industry is about to make their biggest change yet, removing nearly all blinds with cords from the market. But millions will still be hanging on parents' windows.
"People think it won't happen to them, that it's a fluke, they say 'I watch my kids,' " Sutton says. "Nobody watches their kids 24-7."
Sutton's story isn't unusual. In fact, more than 16,000 children in the US were treated in emergency departments for injuries caused by window blinds between 1990 and 2015, an average of almost two children every day, according to a study published Monday in Pediatrics. Although most of those children (93 percent) weren't seriously injured, 271 children died during that time.
Almost half of injuries overall involved being hit by the blinds, usually causing only cuts or bruises, but more than 1 in 8 children (12 percent) became entangled in blinds' cords. Two thirds of children who became entangled in the cords died, averaging nearly one child every month for the past 26 years. And those are just the injuries and deaths recorded in the two databases used for the study.
The researchers analyzed all injuries between 1990-2015 to children under 6 years old reported in the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) and the In-Depth Investigation databases maintained by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). But these databases underestimate actual injuries, since they only include children treated in emergency rooms, explains Dr. Gary Smith, a study coauthor and director for the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.
"Injuries treated in emergency departments do not represent the complete spectrum of injuries associated with blinds," Smith wrote via email. Some injured children stay home or see a non-emergency medical professional. "In particular," Smith added, "the NEISS may not capture fatal injuries that are not transported to the emergency department or occur after inpatient admission."
Like 3-year-old Daniel, most of the children who die are toddlers, and 43 percent were last seen asleep or going to sleep. Another third were playing, and 14 percent were watching TV.
"Most of these accidents happen during nap time or when they're supposed to be sleeping, and no one watches their child while they're sleeping," Sutton says. "It only takes under a minute for a child to lose consciousness because their air supply is cut off."
And that makes strangling silent, like drowning.
"You can't make a lot of noise because you can't breathe," Sutton says. "You can't yell out."
As with many child injuries, parents often believe it won't happen to them, says Dr. Ben Hoffman, pediatrician and injury prevention specialist at Oregon Health & Science University's Doernbecher Children's Hospital in Portland.
"Kids are smart and impulsive and curious by nature, and we either anticipate what their development is right up front or we react to it," Hoffman says.
Pediatricians and pediatric health care providers need to educate parents on the risk during well child visits, particularly before children reach the ages of 1-4 years old, when they're at the most risk, Smith says.
"But messaging is not enough," Smith adds. "Designing the problem out of existence, in this case by manufacturing only cordless blinds, is the most effective strategy."
Corded blinds have long dominated the market and cost less than cordless ones, but that's about to change. The CPSC has long been aware of hazards of corded window blinds and considers them among the five most dangerous hidden hazards in homes. They recommend only cordless window coverings in any place children might live or visit and have recalled more than 5 million window products, "including Roman shades, roller and roll-up blinds, vertical and horizontal blinds," they state on a poster showing (with a doll) how children can become entangled in various corded products.
The agency has worked with manufacturers over the years to improve safety standards in manufacturing. They communicate details about specific injuries to the Window Covering Manufacturers Association (WCMA), the main association for window blinds manufacturing. The WCMA, for its part, regularly reviews and issues manufacturing safety standards for corded window covering products and is currently revising their safety standards, with detailed input from the CPSC.
"We're about to approve the most significant change to the safety standards that there's been since it was created in 1996 by segmenting the market and forcing all stock products to have no accessible cords," says Paul Nathanson, spokesperson for the WCMA. That is, any mass-produced window product sold in retail and online stores must be cordless or have no accessible cords.
"Most window coverings sold are stock window coverings, and CPSC staff believes the draft standard offers a vast improvement in addressing the strangulation hazard," the CPSC said in an emailed statement, adding that the new standards "will be a major step forward in protecting children."
The guidelines are nearly complete and awaiting approval from the American National Standards Institute, after which the WCMA anticipates full compliance from manufacturers by the fourth quarter of 2018.
"By this time next year, 90 percent of the products for sale in the U.S. and Canada will be cordless," Nathanson says. "If you want a corded product, you're going to have it custom-made, which is going to be more expensive, and they'll have a salesperson give a safety lecture that homes with children should not have corded products."
These standards are called "voluntary," though that term is misleading, explain both Nathanson and Joe Martyak, the CPSC director of communications. Once adopted and enforced, manufacturer compliance is mandatory. "Voluntary" refers to industry's voluntary participation in the process of developing guidelines, which also speeds them up. Federally mandated standards take a long time to develop and pass, require a public comment period and take even longer to modify.
Congress recommends voluntary industry standards be considered first because industry, government and consumer groups work together to develop them from the start.
"It can happen more quickly, you can have a consensus when it's done, and you already have the industry people at the table," Martyak says.
Previously, in 2015, the WCMA created the Best for Kids program through the Window Covering Safety Council to give "Certified" status only to products with no cords or inaccessible cords, aligning with CPSC recommendations.
Ten years earlier in 2005, Parents for Window Blind Safety created a "Lab Tested, Mom Approved" seal of approval for cordless products or those with inaccessible outer cords. They note that strangulation occurs in licensed day cares and in military housing too, though the latter should be changing.
What Parents Can Do Now To Reduce Strangulation Risks The CPSC's printable safety poster makes three recommendations for consumers: Examine all shades and blinds for accessible cords on the front, side and back.
Use cordless blinds in homes with young children.
If you cannot afford new, cordless window coverings, contact the Window Covering Safety Council at 1-800-506-4636 or at www.windowcoverings.org for a free repair kit to make them safer.
Last year's National Defense Authorization Act included a provision from Senator Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., that "directs the Secretary of Defense to remove and replace window coverings with accessible cords from military housing units in which children under the age of 9 reside," states a press release from Blumenthal's office. That provision, however, did not include an enforcement mechanism or funding for the directive. Maryland is the only state to address the issue: A 2010 law banned corded blinds in day cares and foster homes. Other legislation, such as a California bill in 2015, never passed.
Even these laws and new standards likely would not exist if not for parent advocacy, says Linda Kaiser, president of Parents for Window Blind Safety, whose 1-year-old daughter Cheyenne strangled on a blind's inner cord.
These changes should have been done a long time ago," Kaiser says. They said Canada is already about to ban all corded products, which she'd like to see in the new standards. "I believe what [the WMCA] did was commendable and good, but I believe there's still work to be done."
Nathanson said the technology is not yet available to create cordless blinds that meet the needs of special populations or situations.
"Homes with children should not have corded products," they say, but "there is still consumer demand for some corded window products." They listed people with disabilities, short people and situations when a window is not easily accessible, such as behind a furnace. They added that WMCA is working on cordless products for these situations.
Kaiser countered that the elderly and people with disabilities already accept cordless window coverings.
"They have special accessible wands to operate the window coverings, making cordless and inaccessible cords a better choice for the elderly and people with disabilities," they say. They said more cost-effective motorized products will hit shelves soon too. "Motorized is revolutionizing the industry," they say of prototypes that manufacturers show them for feedback.
Still, millions of products will remain in homes after the new standards go into effect. WMCA and the CPSC both have education and awareness campaigns similar to the parent group's campaign to encourage parents to ditch corded products.
"Millions and millions of window coverings out there have cords and exposed string in them," Martyak says. "We are trying to get out the urgent message to be aware of the hidden danger, especially if you have young children around or visiting." They recommend parents pull the blinds way up so they and the cords out of reach or, if that's not possible, to use alternatives such as shades.
But the awareness campaigns and new standards still neglect a major problem: too many families cannot afford to buy new blinds.
Some families can start small with windows in one room at a time, Smith recommends, starting with rooms where their children spend the most time, such as children's bedrooms and the living room. But many other families cannot even do that.
"The most vulnerable families don't have a choice because they live in subsidized housing or rental properties," Hoffman says. "Everything about injury prevention is harder if you don't speak English, have a lower educational attainment or low socioeconomic status." Often, tenants are not even allowed to remove or replace blinds even if they can afford to.
Kaiser wants to see a federal law banning corded products at least in standardized and multi-family housing, which CPSC and WCMA have said they will work on. Until then, plenty can be done to ensure parents are aware of the risk in the first place, Sutton says.
"We're told to cover up the electrical sockets, to put locks on the cabinets and the drawers," they say. "But we're not told about the corded window blinds. That should be something that, when you're taking home your baby, should be incorporated into the safety information nurses tell you."
Sutton knew to tie up the cords. If they had known that wasn't enough, that they needed to cordless blinds instead, Daniel would have celebrated their 11th birthday last October.

In what was one of the most crucial turning points in The Handmaid's Tale so far, the new Ofglen planned a surprise attack on the commander's brand new Red Center. The bomb they planted took out numerous handmaids and commanders, including Commander Pryce, but what about the man who holds June's fate in their hands? They were giving a speech at the time of the bombing, but is Commander Waterford dead on The Handmaid's Tale?
Despite being in such close proximity to the explosion, Commander Waterford survived the bombing. The seventh episode of the season, “After, starts out with a creepy, all to to perfectly choreographed funeral for the handmaids that inadvertently died in Ofglen's attack. Somehow, Fred Waterford made it out alive, but after sustaining some serious injuries, they are laid up in the hospital, with their wife Serena at their bedside. Their odds of a full recovery look pretty good, and I'm sure he'll have a large part to play in stabilizing the government and restoring the future of Gilead.
While they recoops in the hospital, Commander Pryce's replacement, Commander Cushing, is taking a scorched earth approach to find and eliminate the people who helped Ofglen perpetrate the attack. As June and the other handmaids return from the funeral, they see the streets scattered with hanging bodies, including numerous marthas and Ofglen's host family (Commander Deeds and their wife). After lining the streets with corpses, Cushing comes to the Waterford house to interrogate June about their kidnapping, insinuating that it was really an attempt to escape orchestrated by the Waterfords. Of course, June knows the repercussions of admitting the truth would be dire and straight out deadly, so they stick to the helpless, kidnapping victim shtick.
TV Promos on YouTube
When Serena comes home from the hospital that night, June tells them about Cushing's visit, and reminds Serena that Fred, who's barely able to move or speak, will be unable to help protect the family from the investigations. So, in their true callous and calculated style, Serena drafts up warrants for Cushing's arrest with Nick's help, even forging Fred's signatures on the documents. When Cushing arrives at the Waterford house soon after, Commander Warren (Janine's baby's father) and a team of armed guards arrest them and strip them of their command “by order of Commander Waterford” on charges of apostasy, treason, and aiding terrorists. Well played, Serena, well played.
In what looks like a combination of a power trip and a move for self-preservation, Serena draws up more orders. They tell June that they have drafted “new security orders” to scale down guardian presence and remove unnecessary checkpoints so that things can return to normal after the bombing. The weirdest twist to their whole plan is that they ask June to read over and edit the documents, handing June a pen in the final, and most meaningful moment of the episode. Because a pen is mightier than a sword, especially when there's a woman yielding it.
So at the moment, Commander Waterford may not be dead, but just like their health, their power and influence are immensely fragile. Luckily for him, they have a tough wife that has taken the reigns -- albeit through forgery -- to preserve their position and protect their family. But it looks like there will be repercussions. In a sneak peek of episode eight, Fred seems to be home from the hospital, and it looks like he's getting ready to reprimand Serena for taking matters into their own hands. No matter what their status, in Gilead women don't really matter, but seeing Serena suffer a little might feel like poetic justice, after all, they were the mastermind behind this hedonistic value system anyway.
Twitter's recently launched “Explore” section will now feature live videos sourced from Periscope within its “Top Trends,” the company announced yesterday. The move will further integrate Twitter's standalone live streaming app into its main platform, leaving even fewer reasons to keep a separate app dedicated to live streaming video around.
The company has been criticized for its slow progress in integrating Periscope's live streaming capabilities into its own app following the acquisition of the up-and-coming live broadcasting tool back in early 2015. Instead of leveraging Periscope's technology to immediately build out its own live streaming platform within Twitter, the company instead tried to operate Periscope as a separate entity – similar to how Facebook treated Instagram.
But unlike Instagram, Periscope was acquired pre-launch, so it didn't have an existing community to build upon. It also faced intense competition from other tech giants, including Facebook and YouTube, as well as the then-newcomer startup Meerkat (which has since exited the live streaming race.)
Over the past several months, Twitter has been course correcting with regard to how it treats Periscope, however. In December, it launched the ability to live stream directly in Twitter itself, without having to open up the Periscope app. The streams started on Twitter would also be visible in Periscope, but the second app was no longer a requirement.
In addition, Twitter's mobile redesign – which saw it replacing the “Moments” section with a broader “Explore” area for search and discovery of trends, Moments, video and more – has also put a greater emphasis on live video. Of course, this includes those live streams Twitter now hosts through its numerous media deals, like those with the NFL and other sports organizations, Dick Clark Productions for various red carpet events, media outlets for political and business news coverage, and more.
Now, it will tap into Periscope to promote the live streams from individual users as well.
Watch what's trending – LIVE! You'll now see Periscopes surfaced in top trends. pic.twitter.com/Bhj8JT2ITw — Twitter Video (@TwitterVideo) February 14, 2017
These streams will be found in the “Top Trends” section within Explore, which is where you can browse the top hashtags and keyword searches that are currently blowing up on Twitter's network. When live videos are taking place in one of those trending sections, they will be marked with a bright, red “LIVE” label for easy spotting.
When you watch the video, you'll have the same experience as in Periscope – with the ability to heart and comment on the video content, as well as retweet.
Whether or not live video is available won't influence the selection of trends, apparently. As of the time of writing, none of the top trends are featuring live video. However, in the case of breaking news, it will be easier to “tune in” to the live content on Twitter, courtesy of this new feature.
Two Canadians among 18 people killed in Burkina Faso extremist attack
UPDATE: 9:20 a.m.
Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland says two Canadians were among 18 people killed in a suspected extremist attack on a popular restaurant in Burkina Faso.
The incident happened late Sunday when suspected Islamic extremists opened fire at a Turkish restaurant in the country's capital.
Freeland says “the heartfelt condolences of our government go out to the loved ones of those targeted and the victims of this tragic attack.”
They say Canadian consular officials are working hard to provide assistance to the families of the victims.
Local authorities say other foreigners killed include two Kuwaitis and one person each from France, Senegal, Nigeria, Lebanon and Turkey.
Seven Burkina Faso citizens were also killed and authorities said three other victims had not yet been identified.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the violence, which continued into the early hours Monday.
The attack brought back painful memories of the January 2016 attack at another cafe that left 30 people dead.
Burkina Faso, a landlocked nation in West Africa, is one of the poorest countries in the world. It shares a northern border with Mali, which has long battled Islamic extremists.
More coming.

Zozotown, which swooped in as a little-known retail website and prodded once-reluctant Japanese consumers to shop online for clothes, is now facing stiff competition in the industry whose image it remade.
TOKYO: Zozotown, which swooped in as a little-known retail website and prodded once-reluctant Japanese consumers to shop online for clothes, is now facing stiff competition in the industry whose image it remade.
Arriving on the scene in 2004, the site made a killing selling clothes from shops such as Japanese boutique United Arrows and minimal French label A.P.C.

Zozotown's success turned its founder into one of Japan's richest entrepreneurs, and its name adorns a baseball stadium.
But its dominance is being challenged, with retailers expanding their e-commerce offerings and big names such as Amazon and SoftBank Group Corp eyeing a piece of the growing business.
At stake is a US$120 billion fashion market that was almost entirely dominated by brick-and-mortar stores until a few years ago, but is transforming amid the proliferation of smartphones and home delivery.
Online fashion sales have grown to over 10 percent of the total Japanese market in the past few years - with Zozotown at the head of the pack - and are likely to surpass 20 percent in three years, according to Nomura Securities.

"There needs to be a second player, and we are putting up our hand," said Yusuke Tanaka, founder and chief executive of fashion website Locondo Inc.
To differentiate itself, Locondo specializes in shoes and, unlike Zozotown, offers free returns - still a rarity in Japan. It also shares inventory with fashion site Magaseek.
For now, Zozotown is "totally sweeping the board," said Yuki Ando, general manager of web business at Sanyo Shokai Ltd, the fashion company behind lines such as Mackintosh Philosophy.
Zozotown is operated by Zozo, officially called Start Today Co Ltd.
sentifi.com Channel NewsAsia - Sentifi topic widget
The website set itself apart in its early days with a clean, uncluttered design and a slice of "Ura-Hara" style - the modish fashion of the backstreets that line the trend-setting Harajuku district of Tokyo.
Business took off as fashion-conscious professionals in their late twenties and early thirties started using Zozotown to buy trendy but work-appropriate threads online from labels such as United Arrows and Nano Universe.
Its target is now broader, selling over 6,800 brands including, starting next week, clothes by Shimamura Co Ltd, one of Japan's largest mass market chains. But industry executives say it still has an enviable cachet.
Zozotown has an "overwhelming ability to attract customers," says Takahiro Kinoshita, a manager in the digital marketing department of United Arrows.
RISING RIVALS
In February, fashion company Stripe International launched Stripe Department, an online joint venture with SoftBank Group Corp.
The site features recommendations by stylists, and targets a user base that's slightly older than that of Zozotown, the company says.
Amazon is trying to raise its fashion credentials in Japan, sponsoring catwalk shows in Tokyo. The head of Amazon Japan's fashion unit, James Peters, says fashion is one of the company's fastest-growing areas, but declined to provide figures.
Retailers that had historically focused on expanding their physical presence are also shifting to e-commerce. Japan's Fast Retailing Co Ltd, which controls the Uniqlo brand, is trying to grow online sales, which are currently less than 8 percent of the company's total. Chief executive Tadashi Yanai said they want to see that to rise to 30 percent.
Even the brands that drove Zozotown's early success are now competing with it.
United Arrows still makes almost 60 percent of its online sales through Zozotown. But sales on the brand's own website are growing rapidly too - up 35 percent in the last fiscal year, which ended in March.
Fashion company Bay Crew's Group said 30 percent of its online sales come from Zozotown. But 60 percent are through its own website, generating precious customer data, said Jun Shimada, a senior executive.
EARLY ADOPTERS
Foreign companies are helping Japanese retailers polish their online presence. Sweden's Virtusize, for instance, adds code that allows users to compare the fit of items to those they already own.
"Our biggest market by far is Japan, where close to 20 percent of all online retailers use Virtusize," said chief executive Gustaf Tunhammar, adding that Europe was the second-largest market, and that "only a handful" of retailers in the U.S. used the technology.
Japan is also one the largest markets for UK-based 3D-A-Porter, which offers three-dimensional body scanning and virtual clothing try-on, according to CEO Lara Mazzoni.
Zozotown, meanwhile, has deployed its own high-profile technology to fight a slowdown in transaction value growth. Its Zozosuit collects body measurement data that allows users to order fitted clothing online.
The company is breaking new ground in deploying such technology on a large scale, with more than 550,000 suits sent to customers. Success would transform Zozotown, founded by punk rock-loving billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, into a brand in its own right.
But managing all that data in an era where privacy concerns can roil consumers will be crucial, said Ed Gribbin, U.S.-based CEO of apparel business and product development consulting firm Alvanon.
"There is more resistance to providing data to retailers on the one hand, but the bottom line is that finding the right size and a flattering fit usually outweighs the privacy issues," they said.

With the country awaiting the triple talaq verdict from the Supreme Court, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in their address to the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day said “he admired the courage of the women who led the revolution against triple talaq”. The PM said they “believes that the country will fully support them in their struggle”.“I want to mention those women who have suffered due to triple talaq. I admire their courage. We are with them in their struggle. Women in the country created a revolution against triple talaq. The contribution of our mothers and sisters is very important… Now there is an atmosphere against triple talaq in the country… I believe India will fully support these women in their struggle,” said Modi.This was not the first time when the prime minister addressed the issue of unilateral divorce. In June this year they had voiced their concern over the issue while addressing a BJP conclave in Bhubaneswar. “Sangharsh nahi samajha kar parivartan lana hai hume (We have to usher in social change through dialogue and not conflict or violence),” Modi has said.Hours before their Independence Day speech, the PM received a ‘Model Nikahnama' from All India Women Personal Law Board, which gives women the option to do away with triple talaq. The board has also requested Modi to link Nikahnamas with Aadhaar numbers of the bride and groom to curb polygamy and other misogynistic practices.Modi government had also shown unequivocal support to the cause when it submitted an affidavit in the Supreme Court supporting the plea of the petitioners to strike down triple talaq as it's ‘unconstitutional'.PM Modi said violence in the name of faith was unacceptable. “Violence in the name of astha (faith) will not be accepted in India. There is no place for intolerance in today's India… this is land of Gandhi and Buddha” said Modi.

Alberta is suspending portions of its draft plan to protect threatened woodland caribou, saying more research needs to be done and that Ottawa needs to help out.
Environment Minister Shannon Phillips told the house Monday that the province is acting on concerns about the economic impacts of the protection plan.
“The federal Species at Risk Act is an extremely inflexible instrument that has already had negative economic consequences (in Alberta),” said Phillips.
“We are going to do our best to make sure that we protect jobs on this.”
READ MORE: Alberta government unveils draft plan to address endangered woodland caribou herds
Phillips said they have sent that message in a letter to their federal counterpart, Catherine McKenna.
Phillips is urging the federal government to help Alberta come up with a workable solution rather than have Ottawa impose an environmental protection order.
Alberta's draft plan is in response to a federal deadline under the Species at Risk Act passed last October and is designed to help threatened woodland caribou recover in 15 different ranges.
READ MORE: Rally held at Alberta legislature to press government on caribou protection plan
The province released its draft plan on Dec. 19 and then held a series of town hall meetings.
“The public meetings were attended by thousands of Albertans who are concerned about the impact caribou range plans will have on their communities and on the industries that support those communities,” stated Phillips' letter, which was co-signed by Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd.
The province plans to spend more than $85 million in the next five years to restore caribou habitat by eliminating seismic lines, building birthing pens and bringing in other measures.
It has already invested $9.2 million and the estimated cost over the next 40 years is $1 billion.
READ MORE: Letter says federal government should manage Alberta's threatened caribou
Phillips said the feds need to step up on planning and consultation, and on the money side as well.
“Caribou recovery cannot occur without an infusion of federal funds to restore habitat necessary to ensure population growth,” they wrote.
“While we need more time and partnership from the federal government on this matter, we also need your support in not prematurely implementing federal protection orders that will not have effective outcomes for Canadians and Albertans.”
The federal government has the option of imposing an environmental protection order if a province doesn't come up with a plan to protect the caribou. The order would halt any development, such as oil drilling, that could harm the animals.
YESTERDAY was St Helens' 150th birthday, and it feels like that long since Castleford won there.
Since Super League began in 1996, the best they have managed was a 32-32 draw in 1998. Castleford's most recent win on any of St Helens' various home grounds was 12-8 in a Regal Trophy tie in 1992 and they haven't tasted league success there since a 29-16 victory in 1990.
Paul McShane's run is held by Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook and Danny Richardson.
Castleford went into the sides' opening Betfred Super League fixture with high hopes of ending that 30-game winless run, but not only did the hoodoo continue, Tigers found themselves on the wrong end of the sort of drubbing they were accustomed to handing out last year.
Two tries in the opening seven minutes set the scene and Castleford were 22-0 adrift by half-time.
Things did not improve for last year's league leaders and Grand Final runners-up in the second half as Saints ended with a total of eight tries, seven of them converted by Danny Richardson.
It is a century and a half since Queen Victoria granted the charter that incorporated the municipal borough of St Helens, bringing together the townships of Eccleston, Parr, Sutton and Windle.
A year of celebrations is planned and on this very early evidence, that could include a day out at Old Trafford in October.
Saints were white hot and most of what they did came off, but it was a grim night for Tigers.
Castleford could not blame off-season changes for their lacklustre effort. Unusually for an opening fixture, there was only one new signing on show, Castleford giving a competitive debut to prop James Green.
Teenager Jake Trueman was preferred to Jamie Ellis at stand-off and Joe Wardle was not risked due to a slight “niggle” picked up in training.
All Saints' players were at the club last year, but after a full pre-season under coach Justin Holbrook and with full-back Ben Barba now fully acclimatised, they looked even sharper than the team which finished last year so strongly.
Barba is favourite to be named Man of Steel this year and the Australian showed exactly why in the opening half an hour, scoring one try, helping create another and then providing the kick or final pass for two more. In the second half they added another assist and their second touchdown.
Barba was in support to cross after just four minutes when Mark Percival broke down Saints' left and drew full-back Ben Roberts. Then in the next set, James Roby powered through the middle, Jon Wilkin, Barba and Roby again kept the ball moving and Zeb Taia was on hand to go over.
Saints added a third touchdown after 24 minutes. Barba's kick seemed to be going dead, but Alex Walmsley batted it back and Jonny Lomax touched down.
Referee James Child indicated no try, but they were overruled by video assistant Phil Bentham.
Lomax landed a 40-20 in the next set, Tigers were penalised and from that Percival powered over from a show and go by Barba and the conversion made it 22-0.
Castleford came out with more purpose in the second half, but without really threatening.
Saints were comfortable enough to tap a penalty in front of the posts after 55 minutes and their adventure was rewarded with six points rather than two when Percival forced their way over from a pass by – inevitably – Barba.
Soon after that, Saints prop Kyle Amor was sin-binned for raising a knee on Roberts in a tackle and Tigers took advantage to break their duck through Paul McShane, who crossed from Green's neat offload and Luke Gale converted.
With 13 minutes left Barba capped an outstanding display when they got across to shove Greg Eden into touch, then scored their second try – which Richardson improved – in the resulting set.
Barba's pass almost set up a late score for Regan Grace, but –after Child indicated a try – Bentham spotted a hand in touch.
Even so, Saints added back-to-back tries in the final moments as Taia scored their second and Percival completed a hat-trick to end a miserable night for Tigers.
St Helens: Barba, Makinson, Morgan.,Percival, Grace, Lomax, Richardson, Amor, Roby, Thompson, Peyroux, Taia, Wilkin. Substitutes: Fages, Walmsley, McCarthy-Scarsbrook, Knowles.
Castleford Tigers: Roberts, Minikin, Webster, Shenton, Eden, Trueman, Gale, Moors, McShane, Green, Holmes, McMeeken, Massey. Substitutes: Millington,Milner, Sene-Lefao, Cook.

SYDNEY: Food giant Heinz's misled consumers about the health value of Little Kids Shredz products for toddlers, an Australian court ruled Monday (Mar 19), adding that the US firm should have been aware the claims were deceptive.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission took Heinz to court in 2016, saying images and statements on Shredz products, which contain fruit pastes, purees and concentrate, indicated they were healthy and nutritious for young children.
The national consumer watchdog said such claims were misleading as the products contain more than 60 per cent sugar, significantly higher than fruit and vegetables, with the Federal Court agreeing.
"Heinz ... represented that (they were) beneficial to the health of children aged 1-3 years when by reason of their high sugar content and sticky texture, the products were not beneficial," Justice Richard White said in their judgment.
They found that Heinz had "engaged in conduct which was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive in contravention" of Australian Consumer Law.
"I am satisfied that each of the Heinz nutritionists ought to have known that a representation that a product containing approximately two-thirds sugar was beneficial to the health of children aged one to three years was misleading," they added.

The judge rejected another ACCC assertion that Heinz had claimed the products were of an "equivalent nutritional value" to fruit and vegetables and would encourage the development of healthy eating habits for children aged one to three".
Heinz Australia managing director Bruno Lino added that Heinz was committed to providing high-quality food products and to communicating clearly with consumers.
The Shredz products are no longer on sale in Australia.
The ACCC welcomed the court's decision and said it showed there were "serious consequences" to making false or misleading claims about the health benefits of products.
A date for a hearing on penalties and other orders sought by the ACCC has yet to be set by the court.
The World Health Organisation recommends limiting the intake of foods containing fruit juice concentrate to reduce the risk of obesity and tooth decay.
BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) — Dozens of people joined local and state leaders in statewide rallies Saturday to demand more federal aid to help Puerto Rico relief efforts. It's been four months since Hurricane Maria devastated the island. Now governor Andrew Cuomo and local leaders want the federal government to work harder to restore its power grid.
Dozens of people showed their support of Puerto Rico at the Belle center in Buffalo. Many of them holding signs with the message ‘Rebuilding Puerto Rico – better and stronger,' and the Puerto Rican community here in Western New York wants the federal government to not only hear that message, but act on it.
Governor Andrew Cuomo is urging House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to fund a $94 billion disaster relief aid package.
Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul says although relief efforts are on-going, the work isn't done.
“People cannot take hot showers, they can't cook food, there's no refrigeration. And as the summer starts getting hotter down there as they head into that season they don't have air conditioning so people's lives are still terribly affected. And we're not abandoning them here in the state of New York,” said Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul.
Local and state leaders are also asking the federal government to make the commitment to stay in Puerto Rico until the has power and the power grid is restored.
More than 400,000 people are still without power. Governor Cuomo is asking people across the state of New York to contact Speaker Ryan at (202) 225-0600 and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at (202) 224-2541.

Unless you're planning on setting up stereo pairing with multiple HomePod speakers, there's no reason you should keep them in the same room. Turn your abode into a house-wide sound system with multi-room audio and your various HomePod speakers. Here's how to set it up.
How to set up multi-room audio with your HomePod speakers
Setting up your HomePods for multi-room audio is fairly simple. The difficult part is deciding where to put each one. In order to use multi-room audio, your iPhone and HomePod speakers need to be updated to iOS 11.4 and HomePod OS 11.4.
That's it. AirPlay 2 will automatically kick in and you'll be able to use your HomePod speakers in any room in the house to stream the same tunes, different tunes, or even only on one HomePod at a time.
How to play multi-room audio using Siri
This part's easy. All you have to do is ask! You can tell Siri to play a song in specified rooms, specified HomePod speakers, or everywhere.
"Hey, Siri. Play Kanye everywhere."
Hey, Siri. Play Weezer on HomePod one and three."
Hey, Siri. Play Taylor Swift in the kitchen, the dining room, and the bedroom."
How to play multi-room audio using Control Center on your iPhone or iPad
You don't have to ask Siri for help to play music everywhere on your HomePod speakers. You can select specific music to play from the Music app (or any third-party music streaming app) and then use Control Center to set up multi-room playback.
Select and play the audio you want to listen to from your preferred app. Access Control Center on your iPhone or iPad. Press and hold the Music Control panel. Select the audio track you want to play on multiple HomePod speakers. Tap the AirPlay icon. Select multiple HomePod speakers.
The audio will begin playing in every room that you selected the HomePod speakers for. You can also adjust the volume for each HomePod separately or for all of them at once.
How to select a single room to play audio
Once you have all of your HomePod speakers set up throughout the house, you may not want to play music everywhere all of the time. You can pick which room to play music in without having to be in that room.
You can use Siri. "Hey, Siri. Play Alex's wake up music in the bedroom."
You can also use Control Center the same way you would with only one HomePod.
Select and play the audio you want to listen to from your preferred app. Access Control Center on your iPhone or iPad. Press and hold the Music Control panel. Select the audio track you want to play in a specific room. Select the HomePod you want to play the music through.
How to play different audio in different rooms
Just because you have multiple HomePod speakers throughout your home, it doesn't mean you have to play the same tunes on all of them. You can play your metal mix while getting ready for work while softly playing your kid's Disney playlist to wake them up in the morning.
You can use Siri. "Hey, Siri. Play Slayer in the master bedroom at 50% and the Disney playlist in Sarah's room at 20%."
You can also use Control Center the same way you would to play multi-room audio.
Select and play the audio you want to listen to from your preferred app. Access Control Center on your iPhone or iPad. Press and hold the Music Control panel. Select the audio track you want to play in a specific room. Tap the AirPlay icon. Select the HomePod you want to play the music through.
Repeat steps 1 - 6 for the next HomePod to play different audio through it. When using Control Center, this can be a bit tricky because your iPhone might want to stop playing audio from one app in order to play audio from another. The best way to do this is to make sure each track starts on your iPhone before transferring to a HomePod.
Any questions?
Do you have any questions about playing music across your entire house using multiple HomePod speakers and AirPlay 2? Put them in the comments and I'll help you out.
Some have accused Red Sparrow of being a blatant knock-off of Black Widow. And while the team behind the movie has detracted from that in the past, saying it's not true at all, the real proof comes in the rating. We'll probably never see a Marvel movie that shows nudity, aside from Hulk's beefy green buns, and will never see the kind of torture and violence that is on display in this upcoming action thriller.
The MPAA has revealed the ratings for a handful of upcoming and somewhat anticipated movies. The rating for Red Sparrow has taken some by surprise. It has been awarded the coveted Hard R. Something we don't see too often outside of the occasional Deadpool movie. But Jennifer Lawrence is even outdoing Wade Wilson when it comes to handing out ass kickings. The official Hard R rating for Red Sparrow claims this much about the movie.
"Red Sparrow is Rated R for strong violence, torture, sexual content, language and some graphic nudity."
Now, don't get too excited. Nowhere does it say that Jennifer Lawrence is getting graphically nude, and in this social climate, it's a safe bet that this will be male nudity. We do know that there is a naked shower fight between Lawrence and a male attacker, and throughout all the footage so far, various characters have told Sparrow to 'take off' their clothes. In terms of violence, the movie is bringing out the big guns, literally, and should be a treat for action fans who don't like their beef drained of blood. It sounds like a true romp, and we're promised to get a better taste during the Super Bowl this weekend, with a new Red Sparrow trailer confirmed.
The movie opens March 2nd and follows prima ballerina Dominika Egorova as they face a bleak and uncertain future after suffering an injury that ends their career. They soon turns to Sparrow School, a secret intelligence service that trains exceptional young people to use their minds and bodies as weapons. Egorova emerges as the most dangerous Sparrow after completing the sadistic training process. As they come to terms with their new abilities, Dominika meets a CIA agent who tries to convince them that they are the only person they can trust.
Also getting an official MPAA rating this week is the Tomb Raider reboot, which also follows a strong female protagonist that kicks a lot of asses while taking no names. Only, Lara Croft is relegated to the world of PG-13 fights. The movie gets that friendly rating for 'sequences of violence and action, and for some language.'
Raising some eyebrows is the PG-13 rating also handed out to Wes Anderson's stop-motion animated family film Isle of Dogs. It's going to be a little weightier than most kiddy flicks about canines. And it contains some hefty 'thematic elements and violent images.' Perhaps not as violent as what we'll see in Red Sparrow.
Finally, Alex Garland's new sci-fi film Annihilation has been awarded an R rating for 'violence, bloody images, language, and some sexuality.' The movie was supposed to hit theaters, but it looks like Netflix has officially taken over distribution, with the trippy drama getting a streaming premiere. So far, it looks like 2018 is in for some good old fashion adult entertainment, as Hollywood stops fearing the R rating and learns to embrace it. Lets just hope they put it to the right use. These ratings were all announced by the MPAA.
During Wednesday's Farmer's Market, Regina's downtown plaza was buzzing with food trucks and people looking for a unique lunch stop. Howevers, operators said the city is serving up an unpleasant surprise.
City Permits have been hiked by $300 this year, running some owners $1680.
“I was actually almost ready to pull out of it when I saw that it had increased,” Bon Burger owner Shirley Wellman said. “I figured well, I better go through this and this year I'm really going to be watching where I go.”
“To have a hike like that without sending notice to all of the vendors in advance before the season was totally wrong.”
The city permits allow food trucks to operate on public roads, the downtown plaza, and areas like Rambler Park, Northwest Leisure Centre and the Sandra Schmirler Leisure Centre.
WATCH: YXE Food Truck Festival
Some have chosen to bite the bullet, but sayidthey'll reconsider getting the nearly $1700 permit next year. Others said they were unaware of the jump in permit prices because they've simply never gotten one. They said they get enough business from private events and markets where the city permit isn't needed.
“You're better off to invest in doing larger events and private catering than coming down on the plaza these days,” Nacho Fiesta owner Tim Philp said. “If I go to events that are booked, I know that they're going to be busy. Canada Day has a guaranteed turnout, Cathedral Festival has a guaranteed turnout, Folk Festival has a guaranteed turnout.”

Businesses that already pay for a city permit have to shell out additional cash to take part in the market and other events.
For its part, the city said four food trucks have registered so far this year, compared to six in 2017.
“As part of our traffic bylaw, some of the fees went up for parking permits or street use permits, so the mobile vending permit went up accordingly,”Regina manager of urban planning Shanie Leugner said.
Still, food trucks warn rising permit prices could drive them out of areas like the downtown plaza, ultimately limiting the Queen City food scene.

“I would definitely be disappointed if there were less food trucks,” customer Christine Pinkney added. “I'd like to see them in more places as well. There's such a great lunch crowd here, there's clearly people who want to have food choices.”

For the Piqua boys basketball team, it is a scenario that has played out too many times this year.
And it did one more time Friday night.
A bad first half —followed by a great comeback — only to be unable to finish at the end when the opportunity was there to win.
This time, it came at Tippecanoe High School, where the Indians dropped a 73-68 decision to the Red Devils — which doesn't really reflect how close the Indians were to having a chance at win.
Instead, Piqua drops to 7-11 overall and 4-7 in GWOC American play, while Tippecanoe improved to 11-7 overall and 6-5 in GWOC American play.
After rallying from a 15-point deficit in the third quarter to tie the game, before falling behind again.
Piqua again rallied and a four-point possession tied the game at 67 with 2:09 remaining.
First, as Quirri Tucker was going in for a layup, Tipp was called for an intentional foul.
Tucker made one of two free throws, then Devon Brown had a 3-point play to tie the game at 67.
After a steal by Tucker at the 1:35 mark, Piqua stepped on the baseline with the ball to give it back to Tipp with 1:25 to go.
The Red Devils Cade Gingerich was fouled as they went up for a rebound with 59.1 seconds to go — as the Red Devils had made a living on second and third opportunities at the offensive end all night.
With 59.1 seconds to go, they sank two free throws.
Piqua ran the clock down under 20 seconds, but a long three was off the mark.
Josh Wildermuth grabbed the rebound and fired a length of the court pass to Noah Bledsoe to put Tipp up 71-68 with 12 seconds to go.
After Hayden Schrubb made one of two free throws, Tipp added two meaningless free throws with 2.3 seconds to go for the final margin.
Tipp had jumped out to 9-0 and 11-2 leads in the first half, with the Red Devils scoring of five of their first six possessions.
When Schrubb hit a three with 6:21 remaining in the half, Piqua was back within 23-19.
But, just as quickly, Tipp went on a 15-4 run to open a 38-23 lead, with Wildermuth scoring 13 points in the opening two quarters and Piqua could only close within 41-29 by halftime.
The Indians started the third quarter with an 18-6 run to tie the game at 47 with 1:45 remaining in the third quarter.

Germany's Der Spiegel reported Friday that four people wanted by Turkey for their involvement in the 2016 coup attempt were granted asylum by Germany.
One of them is Ilhami Polat, a former colonel who previously gave interviews to the German media and is wanted by Turkey for organizing the coup attempt at a military school in Ankara.
They had disappeared after the putsch bid on July 15, 2016, was quelled. Prosecutors and eyewitnesses say they were responsible for the takeover of the Land Forces Command Military School and dispatching troops to the office of the Chief of General Staff to take over the army headquarters.
Turkey has repeatedly requested the extradition of pro-coup troops who fled to Germany earlier. If extradited, they might be sentenced to life for their role in the coup attempt that killed 249 people across Turkey.
Their wife Suzan, a former judge, was jailed for their links to the Gülenist Terror Group (FETÖ), which is blamed for the coup attempt.
Suzan had confessed to the authorities that both they and their husband were loyal to the group and Polat said they acted upon the orders of Fetullah Gülen, the U.S.-based leader of the terrorist group.
They later retracted their statements, claiming they had a mental breakdown though they gave lucid details about how their husband told them to "forgive" them and how they were ordered by Gülen to join the coup attempt before they abandoned them at a taxicab station the two met at after a meeting at a FETÖ member's house.
Escaping prosecution for links to the coup attempt and FETÖ, more than 600 military officers and civil servants from Turkey are believed to have applied for asylum in Germany since the coup attempt, according to figures released by the German Interior Ministry last October.
A senior figure of the group in Germany told the German media last year that the European Union country will become "a new center" for the group.
Ercan Karakoyun, who heads the Foundation for Dialogue and Education, a prominent FETÖ-linked organization operating in Germany, told German weekly Die Zeit during an interview that "The [Gülen] movement cannot survive in Turkey."
FETÖ members refer to their group as the "Hizmet [Service] Movement," claiming their work is solely focused on education and charity. However, hundreds of military officers, prosecutors, judges and bureaucrats in Turkey have been accused of working for FETÖ in order to seize power.
A large number of the group's members have fled abroad since the coup attempt in Turkey was quelled, many of whom are now wanted on charges related to the deaths of 249 people who were killed during the coup attempt.
Germany is being singled out among European countries for embracing some 250 fugitive diplomats and soldiers accused of involvement in the coup. The U.S. is the second-most preferred destination for Gülenists fleeing their native Turkey, where the terrorist group's leader Gülen lives in a posh, sprawling retreat in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania.
Ankara condemned Berlin's decision to accept the asylum applications of former military personnel last year. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Germany has shown disregard for democratic principles by welcoming coup perpetrators.

Kundai Benyu will extend their loan at Aldershot Town by a further month after the Shots came to an agreement with Ipswich.
The 19-year-old's current deal was set to end on January 7 after the game with Southport, but they will be at the EBB Stadium for at least another month.
The midfielder has impressed since joining from the Tractor Boys, making three appearances in the league including two dominant performances in the middle of the park in the derbies against Woking, while making their first team debut in the FA Trophy tie against East Thurrock.
GetHampshire reported yesterday that talks were ongoing between the clubs and those seem to have now concluded with both sides pleased at the progress that Benyu is making during their first spell away from Ipswich.
Since signing for the Shots on loan, Ipswich have been in constant communication with the youngster and have been sending staff to watch to the EBB to watch how they have been getting on and they will be encouraged by what they have seen from the youngster.
Meanwhile, Aldershot are set to add a new face on loan ahead of the Southport tie.
You may have noticed lawn signs popping up around the city but they have nothing to do with the upcoming election. No, these are signs meant to welcome newcomers to Kingston and to fight racial discrimination.
The campaign is a collaborative effort with the city, Kingston Immigration Partnership and the KEYS Job Centre providing signs free of charge. Cristian Medina is the project co-ordinator with Kingston Immigration Partnership.
READ MORE: A recent survey reveals 7 out of 10 Kingstonians witness racism and discrimination
“Kingston is a welcoming community, however, when it comes to racism and discrimination, both are problems that all communities are facing.”
Medina says the sign initiative is one way to try to fight that. The multi-coloured signs have the same message: “No matter where you are from, we're happy you're our neighbour,” written in five different languages including Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, Spanish, French and English. Caroline Hall has a sign in their front yard.
“It's all about diversity and community and welcoming people, knowing your neighbours, reaching out and connecting and I love that.” READ MORE: Fighting racism-based bullying in schools
Val Hamilton also has a sign. The Charles Street resident says in times of change, we all need to take visible steps towards making change and they say getting a sign does just that.
The free signs are available until the end of April at a number of locations including city hall, the Artillery Park Aquatic Centre, as well as the Invista Centre.

Several known associates of the Red Scorpion gang have been charged following a multi-month investigation targeting drug trafficking activities in Kamloops, says an RCMP representative.
The charges are a result of multiple operations undertaken by the Kamloops Targeted Enforcement Unit between October 2016 and March 2017, said Cpl. Jodi Shelkie.
The first was on Dec. 1, 2016, when a vehicle was stopped north of Merritt. A substantial quantity of Canadian currency was seized as a result of a search of that vehicle.
Charges were laid against the driver, Gregory Wilson of Coquitlam as well as Brandon Chappell of Kamloops for Possession of Property Obtained by Crime Over $5,000.
Following that, Kamloops RCMP executed search warrants on Jan. 14 at the Heavy Metal Gym and the residence of Chappell.

Within Chappell's home police allege they located another substantial quantity of Canadian cash, drugs and a firearm.
As a result, additional charges were laid against Chappell for Possession of Property Obtained by Crime Over $5,000, Possession of a Controlled Substance for the Purpose of Trafficking and Unlawful Possession of a Firearm.
On March 30, Kamloops RCMP again executed search warrants at the residence of Chappell and additionally Erwin Dagle of Kamloops.
“Within Chappell's home police located a large sum of Canadian currency resulting in a third charge of Possession of Property Obtained by Crime,” said Shelkie.
“Within the home of Dagle, police located and seized a large sum of Canadian currency, bulk supplies of cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, fentanyl and carfentanil which resulted in five counts of Possession of a Controlled Substance for the Purpose of Trafficking and Possession of Property Obtained by Crime.”

During the course of these investigations, Kamloops RCMP seized $191,445.00 in cash, 1.3 kg of cocaine, 56 grams of heroin, 448 grams of fentanyl, 717 grams of methamphetamine, 231 grams of MDMA and one firearm.
Additional operations were executed by the Kamloops Targeted Enforcement Unit following these events.
“These operations included the arrest of street -level traffickers and the subsequent execution of a search warrant into a hotel room within Kamloops during which time additional bulk supplies of controlled substances were seized,” said Shelkie.
“These matters have been forwarded to Crown for charge approval against several other persons associated to this group.”
On the evening of Dec. 7, Chappell, 30, and Dagle, 23, were both arrested in Kamloops without incident.
An arrest warrant for Gregory Wilson, 29, remains outstanding.
All three men were previously known to police.

“Kamloops RCMP prioritize the investigation of violent organized crime groups who traffic drugs in our community. The investigations are lengthy and complex in nature as the targets are typically sophisticated and dedicate their full time to committing these crimes as secretly as possible,” said Staff Sgt. Simon Pillay.
“This case is an example of the motivated nature of those allegedly involved. Despite overt enforcement action, these drug activities continued on until those involved were eventually arrested and charged.”
Shelkie said gangs and their associates have a “callous disregard for the safety of others” when disputes erupt.
“Kamloops RCMP's number one focus is to keep our community safe. We will continue to take strong enforcement action against those individuals and groups that involve themselves in the drug trade and any activities involving violence that supports the drug culture,” said Shelkie.

After one week with a new chief executive, Mattel Inc. is already stepping into new territory — partnering with Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba to design products for China and announcing its first male American Girl doll.
The El Segundo toy maker said Tuesday it will sell items through Tmall.com, Alibaba's sprawling online marketplace. Mattel will also work with the Chinese tech giant's artificial intelligence lab to develop “innovative products” to nurture childhood development.
It's the first public move by Margo Georgiadis, a former Google executive who took over as CEO last Wednesday. In another splash, Mattel announced it will add a boy character for the first time to its American Girl line of dolls and accessories.
In a Tuesday statement, they said China presents a big opportunity for Mattel.
"The multibillion-dollar toy category in China is highly fragmented, with tremendous potential for growth,” they said. “Working with Alibaba, we see a terrific opportunity to develop and lead the category."
Partnering with Alibaba offers insights into the Chinese market that Mattel would otherwise not have, analysts said. The company will also be making this aggressive push into China just a year after the country ended its one-child policy.
“Obviously the potential in China is huge,” said Gerrick Johnson, equity research analyst at BMO Capital Markets. “Just the sheer number of children in China you can address.”
Georgiadis is coming in at a crucial time of turnaround. The company has been overhauling its culture, which has been mired in recent years in red tape, and reviving sales at core brands including Barbie and Fisher-Price. The hiring of a leader with Silicon Valley experience is a sign the toy maker is making a big play for technology as the future of the toy industry.
Many analysts said that Mattel is heading in the right direction, but has suffered some bumps along the way. After a lackluster holiday season, the company reported in January that its fourth-quarter sales and profit missed estimates. That is in contrast to rival Hasbro, which beat expectations.
“From a strategic standpoint, everything they are doing is the right thing,” Johnson said. “The product is so much better. The culture is so much better.”
However, Mattel was probably hampered during the holiday season, dealing with retailers that were less eager to heavily stock its products after years of unimaginative offerings. The company probably had to pony up extra money to get better placement at stores.
“Mattel was coming from a position of weakness versus Hasbro, which has been performing well for the last three years," Johnson added. “They have to do more to convince retailers to take their product.”
The loss of the doll licenses to Disney's blockbuster film “Frozen" and its princess properties to rival Hasbro last year has also dealt the company a big blow. Analysts said those brought in more than $300 million a year for Mattel, and their absence left a major void.
“The toy-making business, particularly now more than ever, is about hitching your wagon to the biggest name out there,” said Jason Moser, a toy analyst at the Motley Fool. “Disney is the brightest star out there.”
Mattel has focused on rolling out new products that speak to a more diverse audience. Last year, Barbie got a whole lineup of new dolls with new body shapes, skin tones and eye colors.
On Tuesday, the company said it is launching its first-ever boy character, a drummer named Logan Everett, under its American Girl brand.
Industry watchers were skeptical that one new doll would make any difference to the bottom line. But it does add to Mattel's reputation as a company actively trying to embrace a wider swath of kids and parents.
“It's not going to be a needle mover,” Moser said. “Perhaps they felt that introducing a boy to the mix could open up that market,” which is almost exclusively female.
As a toy novice, Georgiadis is expected to bring changes to Mattel (the new toy, however, was likely in development well before the new CEO was chosen).
But their initial appointment, followed by the report of Mattel's poor holiday season, added to the uncertainty about the company's immediate future, analysts said.
Some experts think that they could bring a badly needed fresh perspective to an industry already grappling with huge changes in the way children play.
“At this point in the game, Mattel was in need of a total outsider," Moser said. “Number one, they are female, but also a female in tech. I think you are hitting a really tremendous one-two punch there.”

The BC Government and Service Employees' Union (BCGEU) is calling on the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) to protect workers after a staff member was allegedly assaulted by a patient at a high-security Coquitlam psychiatric hospital.
BCGEU president Stephanie Smith described as “violent” the attack that they said happened Tuesday afternoon at the Forensic Psychiatric Hospital — better known as Colony Farm.
It's prompting a call for staff to receive better protection, such as body armour.
READ MORE: Forensic Psychiatric Hospital fined $171,000 for worker safety violations
Colony Farm houses some of B.C.'s most notorious offenders, including Allan Schoenborn, who murdered their three children in Merritt and was found not criminally responsible due to mental illness.
Others in custody there have been found mentally unfit to stand trial.
The incident happened when a patient was released from long-time seclusion, then turned on a staff member, according to Smith.
They said other employees were unable to intervene and restrain the patient because their access was restricted by locked doors, prolonging the alleged assault.
Call for body armour
“[The] injuries that they suffered certainly were serious enough that it's now required a [WorkSafeBC] investigation,” they said.
Smith said the union has been urging the employer for months to provide staff with protection, such as body armour or blocking pads.
“Our staff had raised concerns around the transfer of this patient. They didn't feel that there were enough safety precautions put in place prior to the transfer.”

‘Significant training'
Angela Draude, provincial executive director with the Forensic Psychiatric Services Commission, said the facility is in constant contact with union members.
Questioned about the request for body armour, they said staff have been reviewing safety protocols.

“In the last short while, we've done significant training and improvement that all of our staff have gone through,” they said.
“They received training in provincial violence prevention curriculum as all other health professionals across the province. Everyone has personal protective alarms and there is response codes and response capacity within the facility.”
Draude added that they haven't personally heard a request for protective equipment from the BCGEU.
According to the union, 102 WorkSafeBC inspection reports and 54 safety orders have been filed about the Colony Farm facility in the last five years, mostly resulting from violence.
Last fall, WorkSafeBC fined the hospital $171,000 because of dangerous conditions.

Oakland, USA: LeBron James says he's playing at an "all-time level" entering the NBA Finals even as the 33-year-old superstar defies Father Time to stretch the prime years of their career.
"They always kind of talked about the NBA prime is like 27 and like 31, 32. That's if you're lucky, you'll get to that point," James said. "I've just never really bought into that."
James recalled saying this season that "this is the best I've felt in my career.... And I continue to just play at an all-time-level standard for the rest of this season. Hopefully I can continue it in these Finals also."
James spoke Wednesday on the eve of their eighth consecutive NBA Finals appearance, and ninth overall, as they prepare to lead the Cleveland Cavaliers into a fourth straight championship series against the Golden State Warriors, who seek their third title in four seasons.
Exactly what level James can produce in the final is uncertain after playing 100 games in the season and playoffs combined since late October.
"The level that I can play at is to be seen, but the level I put into the game and put into my craft is who I am," James said.
"So numbers and things like that kind of take care of itself. But for me, I understand and I know how much I put into the game. So everything else is OK.
"I don't really have a ceiling. I want to just try to maximise as much as I can and be as good as I can."
This season might have done it. They have sparked the Cavaliers in the playoffs with 34.0 points, 9.2 rebounds, 8.8 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.1 blocked shots per game.
"It's amazing to watch," said Cavs forward Jeff Green. "That guy has done everything for us. He's playing outstanding, amazing, phenomenal basketball in year 15. I've seen them play some great games, but collectively their playoffs have been truly remarkable."
James, whose 102 million combined social media followers leads all NBA players, has stressed being fit to play this season, the first in which they did not miss a regular-season contest.
"I've been blessed to be available. That's what I take pride in more than anything, is being available to my teammates every single day," James said.
"I've been a leader to my teammates all year and I've put in the work. It's allowed me to be able to tomorrow suit up for the 101st consecutive time. We'll see what happens."
'Body of work is amazing'
Cavaliers guard Kyle Korver is amazed at how quickly and well James can recover after a superlative outing.
"The thing that I'm most impressed with them is their ability to just keep on going, recover mentally, physically," Korver said. Every night they deal with double teams, with scrutiny, with so much stuff, but the next day he's the first person at the gym.
"For them to have done this eight years in a row, to still be the first guy in the gym every day, to do shooting contests after practice with guys on two-way contracts, there aren't people that do that. Superstars in the NBA, there's not many that do that.
"His body of work is amazing."
That's in part because James keeps their body in amazing shape with daily treatments and workouts sustaining world-class conditioning so they can play all 48 minutes if necessary.
"It's a big luxury," Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said. "When he's playing those amount of minutes throughout the course of the regular season, that gets them ready for the playoffs.
"That's why he's probably one of the top conditioned athletes in the world."
LIEGE: Belgium on Wednesday (May 30) paid emotional tribute to two police officers and a student shot dead in the eastern city of Liege as investigators probed the gunman's transition from years of petty criminality to "terrorist murder".
Prosecutors confirmed they were treating Tuesday's bloodshed as an act of terrorism, saying the shooter Benjamin Herman was also suspected of another murder the night before.

Across Belgium, flags were flying at half-mast as Prime Minister Charles Michel led a minute's silence in Liege where around 1,000 people had gathered to pay their respects, among them many police officers.
Belgium's national football squad also halted a training session ahead of next month's World Cup to observe a minute's silence for the victims.
As police scrambled to unpick the gunman's motive for the attack, a dramatic account emerged of Tuesday's bloodshed, which began when the 31-year-old attacked two police officers with a knife.
After repeatedly stabbing the police officers, they grabbed their weapons and killed them in a modus operandi which has been encouraged online by extremists from the Islamic State group.

The two victims were identified as Lucile Garcia, 53, who had recently become a grandmother, and Soraya Belkacemi, 45, a mother to 13-year-old twins.
They then shot dead a 22-year-old student sitting in a parked car in the city centre before entering a nearby school where they briefly took a female cleaner hostage.
Speaking to the Derniere Heure newspaper, the cleaner, who gave their name only as Darifa, said they had asked them whether they were Muslim and if they were fasting for Ramadan.
When they answered "yes" to both questions, Herman said they would not harm them
They then urged them to give themselves up, telling him: "You shouldn't be here, this is a school, there are children!" after which they burst out for their final confrontation with police.
'TERRORIST MURDER'
Investigators are trying to understand how Herman, a drifter who spent a decade in and out of prison for violence and drug offences, came to carry out such a bloody attack.
"The facts are qualified as terrorist murder and attempted terrorist murder," prosecutors' spokesperson Eric Van Der Sypt told a news briefing in Brussels.
They pointed to the fact that "the perpetrator shouted several times 'Allahu akbar'... and information from state security according to which the perpetrator was in touch with radicalised persons."
But they said information about Herman's contacts with extremists dated "from late 2016, early 2017" and had not been confirmed since.
Amateur footage obtained by AFP showed the gunman shouting "Allahu akbar" - "God is greatest" - as they walked through the streets.
In another video, Herman darts out of the school before a short and intense burst of police gunfire, after which they collapse on the ground.
Interior Minister Jan Jambon urged caution over the extremist angle.
"There are signals that there was radicalisation in the prison but did this radicalisation lead to these actions? There, too, we can ask ourselves a lot of questions," they told RTL radio.
GRUESOME HAMMER MURDER
Investigators are paying special attention to the gruesome killing of an alleged heroin dealer linked to Herman who was battered to death with a hammer late Monday in a village near the Luxembourg border.
They found the hammer in Herman's car on Tuesday.
Jambon said police believed they had carried out the killing just hours after getting temporary release from prison on Monday morning.
Liege, a major city in Belgium's blighted industrial rustbelt, was the scene of another bloody shootout in 2011 when another former convict killed six people and wounded more than 120 before turning the gun on himself.
Belgium has been on alert since January 2015 when authorities smashed a terror cell near Liege that was planning an attack on police. That cells had links to Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the mastermind of the November 2015 attacks on Paris that killed 130 people and was claimed by IS.
Another day, another ethics investigation in Vaughan.In their second probe into former councillor Michael Di Biase in as many months, the city's integrity commissioner Suzanne Craig, found the veteran politician “used their position to improperly influence” the decisions of city officials and those with the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) to assist a local landowner in getting approvals to develop on environmentally sensitive lands.Di Biase, who stepped down last month after decades in office, held a seat at the city, at the Region of York and was the vice-chair of the TRCA, an agency responsible for advising municipalities on the protection of lands.Craig's findings allege that Di Biase contravened the city's code of conduct around the “improper use of influence” after they gave inaccurate information to decision-makers on each board that led to an outcome in favour of development at 230 Grand Trunk Ave. in Maple.“My preliminary findings point to the respondent having attempted to improperly influence the decision of the council of the City of Vaughan by inaccurately conveying the position of the TRCA and suggesting that the TRCA had withdrawn its objection to the development when it had not,” said Craig in an interim report posted online Tuesday, which will be brought to council next week.Article Continued Below“My preliminary findings further point to the respondent's subsequent attempt to improperly influence the TRCA Board,” they said.Contacted Wednesday, Di Biase said they delivered their response to Craig on Tuesday, and “will make it available” after Craig's final report is published. They said they did not want to comment until then.In the report, Di Biase said that while “disagreement between members of the (TRCA) board may occur on occasion” it does not mean they “were misled in any way.”
Using a combination of modern thinking and old-school technology, a group of current and former Rutgers Business School students created a business to help people in South Asia commute more effectively and improve their lives.
The business? Roshni Rides.
The company delivers an affordable and reliable public transportation infrastructure throughout Orangi Town, Pakistan, by providing rickshaws and an electronic payment system, similar to modern transit systems across the world. Along with a way to get from place-to-place, Roshni Rides gives a steady source of income for the millions of refugees living in that part of the world.
Roshni Rides was created in 2016, as a response to the Hult Prize Foundation's annual challenge. The foundation asks teams from around the country to solve a social issue; the most recent prompt was to develop a business capable of restoring dignity for a million refugees by 2022.
Rutgers student Gia Farooqi—the company's CEO—along with recent alums Hasan Usmani (COO), Moneeb Mian (CFO) and Hanaa Lakhani (CMO), decided that transportation would be the best method for accomplishing that task and solving another major issue at the same time.
“We tried to identify some of the main problems that refugees faced,” Usmani said. “A recurring problem was transportation, and because the industry had the ability to enable so many people and have countless multiplier effects, we zoned in on it. Any vehicle is welcome to join the Roshni Rides network, but the reason we are targeting rickshaws is because we saw that there is a supply of these vehicles, and a demand not being met, so we wanted to optimize the existing infrastructure by getting multiple people to ride rickshaws.”
The Roshni Rides business is modeled after public transportation systems around the globe, with maps, stations and payment cards. The ridesharing system partners with stores, schools and hospitals around Orangi Town, creating stops that customers can meet at. The vehicles go to those stops and provide rides for the people waiting there. Everything is paid for with a preloaded payment card, so there is no cash needed.
The idea was well received. On Sept. 16, Roshni Rides won the annual Hult Prize competition and was awarded $1 million in funding by former President Bill Clinton. Clinton themselves had issued the challenge for restoring dignity to refugees, and was impressed at how Roshni Rides created a private solution to a large public problem.
The victory highlighted how far the company had come: in just 11 months, the Rutgers group developed a business and put its plan into action.
Like any company, the Roshni Rides team had to overcome some issues. But creating a business that involved social entrepreneurship was important for all four of the company's leaders because it gave them an opportunity to use the skills they learned in school to benefit the greater good of the world.
“There are many challenges associated with any operation, especially an international one,” Usmani said. “I believe our biggest challenge was learning how to react to the market and our customers, and pivoting our idea accordingly.”
“As a business student, I often questioned ethical choices that businesses had to make on a daily basis,” added Lakhani. “After working for a year in the corporate space, I quickly realized that I wanted to find a position that was more fulfilling. Social entrepreneurship is important to me because it is the intersection of what I am passionate about: business and giving back.”
The team believes Roshni Rides will continue to grow. All four founders will be moving to Pakistan to execute the business and see their plan roll out. And thanks to their Hult Prize winnings, they'll have the resources to make a major difference.
“Winning the million dollars meant we could create real impact and change for the people of Orangi Town,” said Usmani.
Where you grow up can impact the rest of your life in some pretty major ways. Which is why it's super disturbing that a new report from Save The Children found that the United States is one of the worst places to be a kid in the world, namely because of income equality. The End of Childhood Report examined how factors such as widespread poverty, conflict, and discrimination threaten childhood in over 175 countries. The report was done in conjunction with another index from the organization called The Many Faces Of Exclusion, which tracks "life-changing events" that cause kids to miss out on being a kid.
Some of those events are displacement because of conflict and extreme violence, child mortality rates for kids under 5 years old, adolescent birth rates, child marriage, child labor, school dropout rates, and malnutrition, according to the report. The best countries for a child to grow up in, considering these factors, Singapore and Slovenia tied for first place, with Norway, Sweden, and Finland in the other top spots, the report found. The worst of the bottom 10 countries are in West and Central Africa, with Niger coming in the last place, according to the report's findings. So what about America?
The United States ranks 36th on the list, according to the Save The Children report, right between Russia and Belarus. Other developed countries that the United States is often compared to, like the United Kingdom or Canada, are much safer for kids to grow up, according to a statement from Save The Children. Most Americans probably don't consider the country as terribly poor or violent, especially compared to other regions of the world, but the fact is, as the report concluded, that there are over 14 million kids living in poverty in the United States, in both rural and urban areas.

According to the report, 23.5 percent of American kids in rural areas are living in poverty, compared to 18.8 percent of kids in urban areas. Most of the states with the highest rates of child poverty are in the rural Southeast, especially in regions such as Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta. Five states — Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina — have rural child poverty rates of over 33 percent, the report noted. In those areas, kids are more affected than urban children by infant mortality, food insecurity, low education, and teen pregnancy. Like, a lot more affected.
The report shows that 90 percent of the total food insecure counties are in rural areas and four out of five of the places where low education is rampant are rural. Teen pregnancy rates, which nationwide are at the lowest they've ever been, are 60 percent higher in rural areas than in urban ones.

Mark Shriver, Save the Children's Senior Vice President for U.S. Programs & Advocacy, said in a statement:
Children in rural America are more likely to die in infancy, miss out on meals, become pregnant as teenagers and not attend college. Rural child poverty rates have been persistently high for at least three generations in the U.S. That's why Save the Children is working in the rural areas most crippled by poverty, helping children overcome the challenges they face because of where they live, so they can reach their full potential.

Carolyn Milles, President & CEO of Save The Children, said in a statement that stats like this demand action. "Without urgent action, we'll never meet the promises made three years ago by every country at the United Nations to ensure every child is in school, protected, healthy and alive by 2030 — governments can and must do more to give every child the best possible start in life."
Especially here in the United States, it makes little to no sense that kids are growing up without access to food, quality health care, or science-based sex education that could keep teen pregnancy rates down. Those should all be priorities, as they are in the other top countries for kids, like in the Netherlands and Italy. Because whether it's in rural America or somewhere halfway across the world, kids deserve to be kids.
Forbes' eighth-highest paid YouTube celebrity of 2017 is Ryan, a six-year-old toy reviewer
The six-year-old Ryan, known for their YouTube channel Ryan Toys Review, earns $11 million from their account, as reported by Forbes.
They stand at an impressive eight on the list of the highest paid YouTube celebrities this year. Ryan, whose last name and location is kept private, has more than 10 million subscribers and is a viral sensation among kids all over, as reported by The Washington Post.
According to a profile of Ryan and their family by The Verge, their family started recording and posting videos in March 2015 when they were three years old. Their mother said to The Verge, “Ryan was watching a lot of toy review channels — some of their favorites are EvanTubeHD and Hulyan Maya. One day, they asked me, ‘How come I'm not on YouTube when all the other kids are?' So we just decided — yeah, we can do that. Then, we took them to the store to get their very first toy — I think it was a Lego train set — and it all started from there.”
What started with a simple 15-minute video of them opening a Lego box and playing with the Duplo train set, has today led to their famous viral video of Ryan reviewing a hundred toys at once. In this popular video, they unpack a giant Easter egg containing Pixar Cars toys and playing with them on a toy slide, back in July 2015.
The channel currently continues to review new toys and kid's food products and feature a fun commentary from Ryan with their parent's guidance off camera.
A hell of a lot has already been written about California, but journalist and former Sacramento Bee feature writer Sam McManis is expanding the canon with a new book (out Feb. 1) documenting their crazy travels and quirky encounters here in the Golden State.
Crossing California: A Cultural Topography of a State of Wonder and Weirdness (Craven Street Books, $14.95) captures the funky, strange and oddball characters and places in virtually all corners of the nation's most populous state. In a company-issued hybrid Honda Civic, they journey from the Oregon border to the international boundary with Mexico, from the Pacific coastline to the High Sierras and Death Valley.
During their five years on the road as the Sac Bee's "California Traveler," McManis visited Los Angeles about four times a year. McManis also grew up in Southern California and spent 10 years working for the Los Angeles Times, primarily as a sports writer. They dedicated 54 pages to L.A. in their book.
L.A. Weekly caught up with McManis, who now lives in Yakima, Washington, and teaches at Central Washington University, to get their perspectives on L.A. past and present, and on our diverse state.
L.A. WEEKLY: You talk a lot about downtown L.A. in your book. How has it changed since you lived here?
SAM MCMANIS: I worked at the L.A. Times from 1980 to 1990. When I'd get off work, downtown was dead. After 5 o'clock, it pretty much shut down. Seeing the transformation (in recent years) was just incredible. It really was a stark change.
I remember specifically working on Thanksgiving. The copy desk wanted to go to Skid Row for Thanksgiving dinner. It was bleak, with tent cities set up across the street from the justice center. There really wasn't a whole lot to do at night. The Broad wasn't on anybody's radar. All that stuff came long after.
But since the Broad — I just saw more people out and about at night. There was a vibrancy now that wasn't there before. Now, obviously, with the lofts and all that, people are living downtown. They've done a really good job of that.
What can you say about gentrification in certain parts of L.A.?
Just like in San Francisco, some of the long-term residents are being pushed out. I did a piece about Farmacia y Botanica A Million Dollar, an old-time Hispanic pharmacy selling tchotchkes and religious items. I don't think it's there anymore. The old L.A. is fighting to endure in an ever-changing, hipsterish new L.A. It's hard to criticize the Broad — it's a beautiful museum, and Disney Concert Hall is beautiful as well. But there's something gone, though, the way it was.
You wrote a segment on searching for L.A. noir. How did you come up with that idea, and what was the reaction when it was published?
I came up with this idea, but people are always giving suggestions. "Did you know that there's a Museum of Death in Los Angeles?" People suggested a lot of macabre stuff. I started poking around, looking at all the dark stuff over the decades in L.A. Orson Welles did Touch of Evil in Venice. Nathanael West wrote The Day of the Locust about L.A. Unless you're a classic film buff, you're going to think of it as this glitzy, glamorous city. But people don't think of it as the depressing place where all of these bad things happened.
It was amazing — after the Sacramento Bee published the story, at least 15 newspapers took that story up. I guess the subject grabbed people. People love having schadenfreude about L.A. I talked about the terrible things that have happened in L.A. It rained when I was there — it was in February. That was perfect. The story got a good reaction. People love nostalgia.

Tell us about the chapter you wrote on a museum dedicated to the San Fernando Valley.
I interviewed a guy named Tommy Gelinas, who started the Valley Relics Museum. The Valley gets no respect. Once again, I found a guy who was very passionate. They collected interesting stuff from back in the day. For decades, the Valley's been a punch line. You can tell when somebody's trying to be a kitschmaster and when someone's really trying to pay tribute or homage to something they really loves. This guy really cared. I wanted to know why.
The Valley has a distinct personality all its own.
What was your experience like visiting the world headquarters for Scientology in Hollywood?
Anyone can do it, as long as you're willing to get programmed. You can actually take the tour of the (headquarters building). The tour guides weren't shy. They were trying to proselytize to you. But I followed the Heisenberg principle — I wouldn't say I was a reporter until after the tour was over. I didn't want to spoil the tour.
They kept on asking us, "Are you happy with your life?" It was kinda creepy. I was there with just people off the street — I didn't know them. I think they were just kind of in it for the kitsch factor, too. I was happy to get out of there after an hour.
Was there any mention of Tom Cruise or John Travolta?
No. They kind of kept the Hollywood aspect out of it. There was no real Hollywood angle to it. They tried to make it very quasi-scientific, saying Dianetics is one of the most-sold books in history and all the great things [founder] L. Ron Hubbard has done.
The Broad is a symbol of the new, "hipsterish" downtown. Mathew Tucciarone
You covered the Lakers during the Showtime era and the Dodgers in 1988, their World Series championship year. What were your impressions?
Magic Johnson was a great guy. They were very respectful to me, and to the other beat writers. Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar) — they were an enigmatic guy. Very respectful but very private. It's interesting to see how he's kind of transformed their life. Now, he's a public intellectual.
I found baseball players to be very combative. Kirk Gibson and I butted heads. Pedro (Guerrero) didn't speak to me. Tommy Lasorda — they would scream at me all the time. They did not always like what I wrote. Baseball was a tough beat — 162 games, on the road for much of the time. Two years of covering the Dodgers with horrendous deadlines — it totally ruined the sport for me.
Any parting thoughts on the City of Angels and California in general?
I'm just continually struck by what I saw, returning to downtown L.A. I think it's a good thing, mostly. Yes, some people are being priced out, and that's bad, of course. But overall, L.A. has transformed itself.
One thing I don't miss: I do not miss the traffic. Maybe L.A.'s a young person's town. But I still have a soft spot for Los Angeles. I prefer it to San Francisco, because I grew up down there. Part of me always remembers that.
As for California, there really isn't one center. There are so many Californias — it's such a diverse state. Someone could be a vegan, and also an NRA member. And it makes sense because it's California.
Ever since the whole drone delivery craze, it's been clear that Amazon is not afraid to mess with the way humans buy and receive goods. And the corporation is still coming up with new ideas — as of Tuesday, Amazon can now deliver packages to parked cars, thanks to a new program called Amazon Key In-Car.
The new program is an extension of Amazon Key, which Amazon rolled out in October 2017. Amazon Key allows Amazon couriers to deliver packages inside a house when tenants are not home by giving them temporary access to unlock the door using smart lock technology. Amazon Key In-Car will work pretty similarly, as noted in a press release shared by Amazon on Business Wire.
To use the service, customers can download the Amazon Key app, and then connect their Amazon account to their car service account. At checkout, simply select Amazon Key In-Car Delivery. When your package is en route, Amazon will notify you of the package's expected delivery window, so you can make sure your car is parked outside in a public area, within two blocks of a delivery address you are required to provide. When the delivery driver arrives at your car, they are able to use their phone to temporarily unlock your car or trunk via OnStar technology. After placing the package inside, Amazon will re-lock your car, and notify you that the package is safely inside your locked car.
amazon on YouTube
The service is currently available to Amazon Prime customers in 37 select cities for no extra charge — as long as they have a compatible car. Users must have a: "2015 or newer Chevrolet, Buick, GMC or Cadillac vehicle with an active OnStar account, and customers with a 2015 or newer Volvo vehicle with an active Volvo On Call account," as per the press release. All of those car brands are owned by General Motors, except for Volvo, which has partnered with General Motors on multiple occasions.
You can check if your car and city are compatible with the In-Car service by clicking here. If your search yields disappointing results, fear not — Amazon plans to roll the service out to more cities and for more cars in the future.
To test the In-Car Delivery, Amazon let a few customers give the service a try in advance, some of whom shared their experience in a video for Amazon. One mom who participated in the trial explained how it was beneficial for a home with young kids.
"I'm a really busy stay-at-home mom. I have a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old," they told the camera, adding that they place a lot of orders with Amazon. "[A delivery] happened today of course, during nap time," they explained. "The dogs didn't wake up my kids, the kids took their nap, everything was really great," they added, before opening their trunk to reveal a box of diapers and several other Amazon packages inside. Any parent knows how disastrous the ring of a doorbell during nap time can be — especially when there are dogs in the house — so this new program could definitely be of service to new parents.
Additionally, the service could be a good option for those who do not have a doorman or doorwoman at their building to accept packages, for those afraid of packages being stolen from their doorstep, and for customers who do not have access to Amazon Lockers, which allow customers to pick up packages from lockers at various pick-up points.
No matter how people feel about Amazon Key In-Car, there's no doubt that Amazon will continue to roll out innovative delivery methods.

LAHORE - Former Test cricketer Akram Raza Tuesday lamented a spineless PCB hierarchy that always failed whenever it comes to bring the discipline among the players and implementing the rules.
Talking to the Nation, Raza held the lenient approach of the board towards player power and unnecessary tolerance for indiscipline that caused the trouble and players getting carried away by it did not hesitate even selling the name of country for few materialistic benefits.
Citing the example of Justice Qayyum report, Raza said if the PCB had just implemented the recommendations made in the report, no player would have ever dared again to bring the shame to the board and the country.
“Everyone keeps on quoting Justice Qayyum report, but they must also know what is written in it. The report is based on only recommendations, which were not the court orders to punish someone. However, the PCB never bothered to implement them fully, and the result is evident in front of all, as after some years, three players were found guilty of fixing and now a few players were also caught fixing the PSL matches.”
The former off-spinner said the PCB needs now to set an example for culprits as their already too lenient attitude towards the fixing trio of M Aamir, Salman Butt and M Asif had made the matter of grave concern a casual one for the others. “Their attitude sometimes had even become quite patronizing especially in case of Aamir and the result of such an attitude is now before us.”
Raza said the matter of fact was that the PCB never wanted to punish its blue-eyed players, that's why they were free to do whatever they like, and also enjoying lucrative jobs. “If the board had set a specific criterion and given exemplary punishments to those found guilty after thorough investigation and solid evidences and banned them for life, it could have helped in purifying cricket from corruption and fixing. In fact, non-serious attitude of PCB has been ruining Pakistan cricket.”
Salim Malik was the only player, who was banned for life by the PCB, not by Justice Qayyum or by any court, and it was also done on the basis of personal liking and disliking. “There were no proper and solid evidences against Malik and it was just recommended to ban him. The PCB never bothered to investigate Malik case fully and just banned them for life, which was a great unjust with him,” they said.
Akram Raza's name was also mentioned in Justice Qayyum report. Coming down hard on it, they asked the PCB to reopen the case and thoroughly investigate each and everything. “If I am found guilty, I am ready to face any punishment. But it is also the duty of the PCB to clear the names of those, who were not found guilty, and they must be given due respect and the board should also beg pardon from them,” they said.
Speaking about the PSL and fixing scandal, Raza said that the entire episode was a result of PCB's wrong policies regarding mishandling of fixing issues and not giving punishment to the tainted players. “Unless the PCB gives exemplary punishments to the tainted players and instead provide them opportunities to represent the country in national team as well as in the cricket board, young players will take fixing issue lightly, and keep on doing wrong things, which will ruin not only Pakistan cricket but also bring bad name to the country," they noted.
“If the PCB chairperson has vowed to fix the fixers, it must ban the accused players for life, as such decisions can help the PCB stop the players from wrongdoings and root out corruption from the game,” they added.
They said that there was a dire need to bring in sincere and professional persons (former players) in the board which could help in making the house in order and overcoming the basic and major flaws. “Unless the PCB brings in professionals and technocrats in each and every department of the board to run all the affairs professionally and smoothly, Pakistan cricket cannot flourish, and instead will keep on suffering,” Raza concluded.
Thiruvananthapuram: Amid outrage over the alleged honour killing of a 23-year-old man in the state, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said stern action would be taken against erring police officials.
"Prima facie it is seen that police has not fulfilled its dharma in this incident and the government will not protect police officers found guilty in the case," Vijayan told a press conference here.
23-year old Kevin P Joseph, a Dalit Christian, was abducted on 27 May by a gang allegedly engaged by their fiancee's family. Their body was found in a river in Kollam district a day later.
While two police personnel have been taken into custody in connection with the alleged honour killing, Sub-Inspector M S Shibu and Grade ASI Sunnymon of Gandhinagar police station were on Tuesday suspended for "laxity".
Kottayam district superintendent of police VM Mohammed Rafique was transferred following the incident.
Referring to the suspension of the two police officers, Vijayan said the action was taken as there were lapses on their part.
However, the chief minister said the government did not view an "isolated" incident like this as a "lapse" on the part of the whole police force. However, they made it clear that stern action would be taken against wrongdoers.
Asked if they plan to visit Joseph's house in Kottayam, Vijayan said visiting the house was not the issue now. "Steps taken by the government to catch the culprits behind the crime are more important. Main accused in the case have been taken into custody and vehicles used by them have also been recovered. As of now, I do not have any plans to visit the house..." Vijayan added.
The chief minister, however, lashed out at the media on reporting the issue and said a section was trying to "insult" Kerala and not following media ethics. "You (media) are trying to insult the state... that is not correct," Vijayan said. A section of the media was spreading the message that police were looking after the security of the chief minister instead of trying to catch the accused when the murder took place, Vijayan said.
"It is improper on the part of the media to report that the chief minister's programme was responsible for the crime," Vijayan said. "The government welcomes healthy criticism from the media on its performance. In this case, there was a police lapse and there is nothing wrong in criticising it," they added.

U2 have revealed a heart-wrenching new short film to coincide with the band's latest single, “You're the Best Thing About Me.”

The documentary about love and separation features a newlywed military couple, high school sweethearts, a Syrian refugee family in Greece and a young couple from Mexico City. The film follows each couple for the final 24 hours they are together before one partner has to leave.
“It's a love song,” explained director Tatia Pilieva of the film. “What's interesting is not the bringing people together; it's the separation.”
Pilieva first came to prominence for their 2014 film First Kiss, where they invited 20 strangers to kiss for the first time on camera. After generating millions of views, it went on to win a Gold Lion at Cannes.
“The key for me is that when these people are saying goodbye, they are still very much in love,” they said of their U2 film. “I didn't want to film a bunch of breakups. I didn't want to put that into the world. I wanted to put out something positive. Yes, it's positively heartbreaking, but there's love all over it.”

A Turkish court on Wednesday sentenced a lawmaker from the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) to 25 years in prison on spying charges, a move their party saw as an attempt to intimidate.
ANKARA: A Turkish court on Wednesday sentenced a lawmaker from the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) to 25 years in prison on spying charges, a move their party saw as an attempt to intimidate.
Enis Berberoglu, the first CHP lawmaker to be handed prison time since the lifting of parliamentary immunities last year, was accused of giving an opposition newspaper video purporting to show Turkey's intelligence agency trucking weapons into Syria.
CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu said they would launch a march in protest against the conviction at an Ankara park on Thursday. Party officials said the march would head to Istanbul.
"We are in the days where the actual guilty are not tried, but the innocent are," they told reporters. "I will be in Guvenpark at 11 am (0800 GMT) tomorrow and we will begin our March until democracy and justice come to this country."
A report in the secular Cumhuriyet newspaper in May 2015 said that trucks allegedly owned by Turkey's state intelligence service were found to contain weapons and ammunition that were headed for Syria when they were stopped and searched in southern Turkey in early 2014.

"The defendant has committed the crime of disclosing information that should remain secret for state security, domestic and external benefits, with the aim of political and military espionage," the court document seen by Reuters said.
The government has denied accusations that weapons were sent to Syria, saying the trucks were carrying humanitarian aid.
Engin Altay, a deputy chairperson for the CHP, said the decision was aimed at intimidating the opposition and was a sign that the judiciary was under government control.
"This decision is intimidation of the opposition. This decision is intimidation of all who are displeased with the AKP," Altay told reporters outside the Istanbul court house, referring to President Tayyip Erdoğan's ruling party.
Following Cumhuriyet's report, Erdoğan acknowledged the trucks belonged to the National Intelligence Organisation (MIT), and said they were carrying aid to Turkmens battling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Islamic State.
They accused Cumhuriyet journalists, including editor-in-chief Can Dundar and Ankara bureau chief Erdem Gul, of undermining Turkey's reputation and vowed Dundar would "pay a heavy price".
Last year, Dundar and Gul were sentenced to at least five years in jail for revealing state secrets in a related case, and the prosecutor is now seeking an additional 10 years in prison for the two over the report on the trucks.
Hurriyet Daily News editor Murat Yetkin noted Wednesday's ruling came as Turkey already faced pressure because of the jailing of journalists and politicians.
"Rulings like this are likely to weaken the position of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and the AK Party government in their diplomatic ventures, especially with the West," they wrote.
Rights groups and Turkey's Western allies have complained of deteriorating human rights under Erdoğan, and a crackdown following last July's failed coup has seen 50,000 people jailed pending trial and some 150,000 detained or dismissed.

Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah was offered a plot of land by the deputy mayor of Mecca, the holiest city in Islam, after winning the Premier League's Players' Player of the Year with their incredible 41-goal debut season.
Saudi deputy more Fahad Al Rooqi said they will donate a plot to the Egyptian national and ranged several options for Salah on how they could use the land.
"It all depends on the player and on the regulations. In case they are allowed to own land in Makkah, they can keep it. They can also use it to build a mosque or launch a charitable foundation. They can also sell the land and keep the money," Al Rooqi told Saudi news site Sabq.
"The gift is a tribute to the Egyptian star known for their great morals and generous character. It is also in recognition of their merits as an ambassador of religious tolerance and ethical values and as a positive model for Muslims in Britain. We are all proud of him," Al Rooqi said.
Salah became an instant national hero and has already had a school from their hometown of Basyoun renamed in their honor.
Salah has surpassed all expectations since their then-club record 42 million-euro (£37 million, $52 million) move back to the Premier League last June and will face their old club in the first leg of Liverpool's Champions League semi-final on Tuesday.
An incredible return of 41 goals in 46 appearances saw Salah crowned the Premier League Players' Player of the Year on Sunday.
CLAIM
President Trump is signing a law legalizing marijuana across the United States.
False
RATING
False
ORIGIN
On 27 May 2018, the web site Your Newswire published an item appearing to report that President Trump planned to sign a law legalizing medical marijuana in all 50 states:
President Trump is set to sign legislation which will make medical marijuana federally legal for terminally ill patients. The bill, known as the “Right to Try Act,” will prohibit the FDA from banning natural cures, and allow patients to try medications that have not been approved by the FDA, but are currently under clinical trial.
The claim had a single source: the cannabis industry site Herb.co. However, that site's 24 May 2018 article was markedly more reserved in its speculative premise:
Trump To Sign Bill Which Could Make Cannabis Federally Legal For The Terminally Ill President Trump is set to sign legislation which could make medical marijuana federally legal for terminally ill patients. The bill, known as the “Right to Try Act,” would allow patients with potentially fatal conditions to try medications that have not yet been approved by the FDA, but are undergoing the approval process and have already passed the first phase of clinical studies. […] What's not clear is what illnesses qualify as life-threatening. Post-traumatic stress disorder, for example, could be argued to be life-threatening given the high rates of suicide among those who are diagnosed, but it's up for debate. It's likely that those details will be hammered out on a state by state basis in jurisdictions that have already passed their own version of Right to Try. The full title of the bill suggests as much stating, “in accordance with State law…” … Under the broad wording of the federal bill, no specific illnesses are mentioned. Instead, an ‘eligible patient' is defined as, “Diseases or conditions where the likelihood of death is high unless the course of the disease is interrupted; and Diseases or conditions with potentially fatal outcomes, where the endpoint of clinical trial analysis is survival.”
While Your Newswire claimed that President Trump was to sign legislation “which will make medical marijuana federally legal for terminally ill patients,” Herb.co originally reported that the Right to Try act could have that effect. The actual bill, of course, made no mention of marijuana specifically. Introduced in February 2017, it read:
SEC. 2. USE OF UNAPPROVED MEDICAL PRODUCTS BY PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH A
TERMINAL ILLNESS. (a) In General.–Notwithstanding the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), and any other provision of Federal law, the Federal Government shall not take any action to prohibit or restrict–
(1) the production, manufacture, distribution, prescribing, or dispensing of an experimental drug, biological product, or device that–
(A) is intended to treat a patient who has been diagnosed with a terminal illness; and
(B) is authorized by, and in accordance with, State law; and
(2) the possession or use of an experimental drug, biological product, or device–
(A) that is described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1); and
(B) for which the patient has received a certification from a physician, who is in good standing with the physician's certifying organization or
board, that the patient has exhausted, or otherwise does not meet qualifying criteria to receive, any other available treatment options.
As noted by Herb.co, broad language was used in the law's text regarding conditions qualifying as a “terminal illness,” substances or devices in its purview, and even the relationship between state and federal law. Critics of the law maintained that it allowed drug companies too wide a berth to market experimental treatments while weakening the Food and Drug Administration's regulatory ability. Proponents argued that legislation of its type enabled terminally ill patients with little left to lose a chance to outlive drug trial phases.
We contacted NORML — the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws — for further clarification and interpretation on what effect, if any, the Right to Try Act of 2017 would have on the use of medical marijuana “in all 50 states,” but have not yet received a response. However, the claim as presented is false; the act itself was unrelated to medical marijuana, and solely pertained to those diagnosed with terminal illnesses. Even under the most flexible interpretations, there was no truth to the statement that President Donald Trump was signing a law legalizing medical marijuana at a federal level.
NEW DELHI: The 39 Indian citizens kidnapped in 2014 by ISIS in Iraq were killed, confirmed external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj today.The minister said in the Rajya Sabha that a deep penetration radar has confirmed the death of the hostages who had been taken from Mosul. Their mortal remains were exhumed and sent to Iraq's capital Baghdad for DNA sample verification ."Yesterday, we got information that DNA samples of 38 people have matched and DNA of the 39th person has matched 70 percent," they said.In July last year, Swaraj firmly said in Parliament that they would not declare the 39 Indians dead without concrete proof or evidence."It is a sin to declare a person dead without concrete evidence. I will not do this sin," Swaraj said in a statement in the Lok Sabha in 2017.Now, with the deaths confirmed, Swaraj said the Indians' mortal remains will be brought back to India by Union minister of state for external affairs, VK Singh."General VK Singh will go to Iraq to bring back mortal remains of Indians killed in Iraq. The plane carrying mortal remains will first go to Amritsar, then to Patna and then to Kolkata," the minister added.Most of the 39 killed were from Punjab and were working on projects near Mosul when they were kidnapped during their evacuation.Swaraj today also informed the House that the story of Harjit Masih, who managed to escape from ISIS, was a lie. Harjit had claimed the Indians were shot dead soon after they were abducted, but that was not how it happened, said the minister.What happened was that Harjit escaped with some Bangladeshi prisoners who were kidnapped along with the Indians. They had earlier falsely claimed that they were shot in the leg and pretended to be dead.(With inputs from ANI)
CAPITOL is now opening the bidding from advertising agencies to handle the advertising and promotion of the programs and projects of the provincial government.
A budget of P3.2 million has been allocated for radio airtime.
Cebu Provincial Administrator, lawyer Mark Tolentino said they invited advertising agencies for a bidding to disseminate programs and accomplishments done by the administration.
“Any LGU (Local Government Unit), for that matter, is mandated to tout its programs and its agenda and accomplishments,” Tolentino, who also sits as chairperson of the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) told reporters on Wednesday.
“The purpose of getting an ad agency is purely practical. If you go to an ad agency they can make placements for you,” they added.
Capitol wants at least 10 minutes of airtime from 8:00 to 8:30 a.m. every Thursday for four months
“It is our intention really is to use that budget in a way that all our projects can reach the widest possible audience,” they said.
It will be the ad agency that would do the placements on radio stations.
“Ang problema man gud diri kay kita sa gobyerno (The problem with the government is that) we pay after the service. Unya ang mga media corporation is pay before broadcast,” they said.
Asked if this was the administration's preparation for next year's election, Tolentino said they are just doing their job.
“We are doing our mandate … It is a non-issue if you ask me,” they said.
The bidding is scheduled on June 18 (Monday) 2 p.m. at the Capitol's BAC Conference Room.

MARK MORAN / THE CITIZENS' VOICE FILE Stephanie McNeil and their attorney Pete Moses walk to the courtroom in West Pittston.McNeil awaits trial on charges alleging they stole thousands from Exeter Hose Company.
WILKES-BARRE — After being hit with two new criminal cases inside of a week, Stephanie McNeil is back behind bars for violating their parole, according to county officials.
As McNeil, the former treasurer of the Exeter Hose Company, awaits trial on charges alleging they stole thousands from the department, the criminal cases against them continue to mount — most recently with a theft case filed Tuesday.
That complaint alleges McNeil, 34, of 212 Cedar St., Exeter, entered the Gerrity's Supermarket in West Pittston on Feb. 8 and got store credit for a stolen box of Mucinex worth $14. Magisterial District Judge Joseph D. Zola arraigned McNeil on Tuesday morning on a misdemeanor theft charge and set bail at $1,000 unsecured.
That case mirrors allegations that resulted in a felony retail theft charge being filed against McNeil in Wyoming Borough on Friday. Prosecutors allege McNeil loaded their purse with packages of Osteo Bi-Flex, Unisom and Mucinex, then sought a $79 refund from customer service because they claimed they just learned they were pregnant and can't take the medication.
Magisterial District Judge Joseph J. Carmody arraigned McNeil on that case Friday evening and released them on $5,000 unsecured bail pending a preliminary hearing Feb. 22.
Following that arrest, county prosecutors on Monday filed a petition to revoke McNeil's $25,000 unsecured bail on the theft charges in the fire department case.
McNeil faces a formal arraignment in April on charges alleging they stole more than $67,000 from the fire company while serving as its treasurer. McNeil got hooked on prescription painkillers and used at least some of the money to buy pills, according to the charges.
As of Tuesday, McNeil was listed as a prisoner at the Luzerne County Correctional Facility. Officials said they were being held on a parole violation and was awaiting a bail revocation hearing before Judge David W. Lupas on Thursday.
In June 2015, McNeil was sentenced to two to 12 months in jail followed by a year of probation after pleading guilty to two counts of access device fraud and one count each of theft and possessing an access device without permission. In that case, they admitted stealing their mother-in-law's credit card to make $552 in unauthorized purchases.
Since becoming a suspect in the thefts from the fire department, McNeil has been charged in two other theft-related cases. In May 2016, McNeil was charged with a summary count of retail theft for stealing from the Dollar General store on Wyoming Avenue in Exeter, a charge for which they were later fined $229.
Days later, McNeil was charged with more shoplifting counts and was fined $155 for trying to steal nearly $300 in merchandise from Kohl's department store in Wilkes-Barre Township.

August has been a remarkably dry month for the QCA. In fact we are now in the midst of the driest start to the month on record. The last time we went this far into the month with only a trace of rain was 1978! This streak should come to an end this week. Scattered storms are possible both today and Tuesday, but better rain chances arrive on Tuesday night into Wednesday. This looks to be a soaking rain that would be a welcomed sight to farmers and gardeners.
Tinder has undoubtedly surpassed all the dating app players in our country. With over 26 million matches every day globally, it has become the most popular dating portals.
Each day, Tinder receives 14 million swipes in India – an increase from 7.5 million in September 2015. In one of the recent surveys conducted by the app, it studied the swiping patters of Indian men and women in our country.
The revelations that the study made are rather interesting!
According to the result for Indian women, sense of humor is the biggest deciding factor when deciding an appropriate match, but men put appearances over everything else.
The survey that was taken by 15000 users also led to the conclusion that if (24.5%) women would seek humor, other (24%) would hunt for shared values and interests, (22.9%) intelligence and (20.9%) would go after good looks.
However, for men, good looks hold a (30.6%) share whereas humor stands at (25.2%) followed by shared values and interests at (24.1%).
Shedding some light on the survey, Taru Kapoor, Tinder India head, said, “The results of this survey were certainly interesting. We're often asked about how men and women differ in their behavior and preferences in online dating, but we've found that men and women value the same characteristics in a partner, largely. Both men and women are seeking partners who are worldly and open-minded. This is a heartening revelation for our users who are seeking to forge meaningful connections as you know that there are others who share your values and interests.”
One-hundred-twenty-five employees will soon be out of work at a Siemens facility in southeast Iowa.
The company announced the closure of all Burlington operations on Monday, including Dresser-Rand, Power and Gas, and Power Generation Services. According to a company spokesperson, the decision was made to enable Siemens “to meet competitive pressure and reduce costs.” The reductions are expected to take place over the next year as part of a two-phase process.
Dresser-Rand has been a staple in Burlington for 148 years, opening as Murray Iron Works in 1870. The facility was moved to its current location in Flint Ridge Business Park in 2008.
Siemens' wind turbine factory in nearby Fort Madison will remain open.

The family of Cody High, 15, of San Angelo, Texas, said they were bitten by a shark on Cocoa Beach, Fla., on Saturday, May 26, 2018. Authorities can't say for sure whether the bite came from a shark.

MELBOURNE, Fla. — A 15-year-old boy was bitten by a "6-foot bull shark" over Memorial Day weekend, their family members say.
Cody High of San Angelo, Texas, was stable after being transported to a local hospital Saturday. They were bitten in Cocoa Beach, Fla., on Saturday.
Eisen Witcher, chief of Brevard County (Fla.) Ocean Rescue, said their agency could not say for sure whether the bite was inflicted by a shark, but family members said they saw the fish.
A GoFundMe page was set up to help Cody's family, who spent a year saving money to go on a Florida vacation, with medical expenses. Cody was released from the hospital Monday but will need rehab and further medical treatment, said their cousin Janice Hotz.

"There were too many stitches to count," Hotz wrote, adding that Cody needed to be transferred to Arnold Palmer Children's hospital where a surgeon was able to treat him.
Cody is recovering and is expected to continue their vacation in a wheelchair.

Nearly a third of Britons say apps are making their finances worse either by encouraging them to spend more or meaning they lose track of their outgoings, a survey has found.
Many are being encouraged to indulge in "out-of-hours spending" by the convenience of apps which enable them to make purchases at the click of a button, according to the research from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).
One in seven (15%) admit to spending using apps while at work.
Many also use their app to shop from the comfort of their bed with 18% of people doing this when they wake up in the morning, and 38% when they curl up under the duvet at the end of the day.
Nearly two-thirds (61%) of people surveyed say apps make it easier to part with their cash, while 31% believe apps have a negative impact on their finances, either meaning they spend more or lose track of their outgoings.
Women spend £131 via apps during a month typically, while men fork out around £115, the research suggests.
Men are more likely to shell out via apps on gambling, travel, socialising, entertainment and music, while women are more likely to use apps for food and general shopping.
Many apps available will help people to manage their budgets more easily and identify areas where they may be overspending.
But less than one in five (18%) people surveyed with an electronic device such as a mobile phone or a tablet have an app that helps them to save or manage their money better.
The FSCS is the UK's savings safety net that protects consumers' savings held in banks and building societies in the event that a firm goes bust, up to an £85,000 limit.
Mark Oakes, head of communications at the FSCS, said: "Being able to make purchases at the touch of a button removes the thinking time you would usually have if you were in a shop.
"It requires discipline to stay in control of your money, not only spending but also saving, but it's worth doing.
"Setting aside just a little a month can add up to a big sum; we are here to make sure your money is protected."
The survey included more than 2,000 people from across the UK.
Some features in Facebook were designed to keep users hooked on the platform which may harm children and adolescents, senior Facebook insiders admitted in a BBC Panorama programme.
The social networking giant is very much aware of the negative effects of addictive technology, according to Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook platform manager, The Telegraph reported on 3 July.
"There was definitely an awareness of the fact that the product was habit-forming and addictive," they were quoted as saying by the BBC.
Facebook's founding president, Sean Parker, earlier said the company was 'exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology' and that the company set out to consume as much user time as possible.
In response to Parker's allegation that Facebook had effectively sought to hook people from the outset, senior Facebook official Ime Archibong told the BBC it was still looking into the issue.
Leah Pearlman, co-inventor of Facebook's Like button, said they had tried to stop using Facebook after leaving the company as they had begun basing their sense of self-worth on the number of 'likes' they had.
The tech insiders also expressed alarm at the way younger children are now being targeted with the launch of Facebook Messenger designed for children under 13.
The Messenger Kids app was launched in the US last year. In June 2018, Facebook introduced the video calling and messaging app to families in Canada and Peru.
Several studies have flagged links between overuse of social media and mental health issues such as depression and loneliness.

According to The News Minute, while most of the victims are women, one minor boy also reportedly died in the accident.
The explosion was intense and caused cracks on the walls of nearby structures, DNA reported.
According to The Indian Express, factory owner Golapalli Rajkumar said only seven to eight employees were working at the time of the explosion. However, a police official told the newspaper 21 people in the factory were making fireworks when a spark on the raw material exploded. An investigation is on to ascertain the actual cause behind the blast, according to the report.

Salem city officials issued a do-not-drink advisory Tuesday following the detection of low levels of toxins in city drinking water pulled from the North Santiam River.
The advisory affects children under 6 years old and vulnerable populations, such as nursing mothers and dialysis patients. Officials are urging them to drink bottled water.
Is there something that can be done to treat the water so it is safe to drink?
David Farrer, a public health toxicologist with the Oregon Health Authority, said there really isn't anything to be done to treat the water.
Boiling the water doesn't work; camping filters don't work; nor do the filters that attach to faucets. Farrer said it's best for children and others in vulnerable populations to not drink the water until the advisory is lifted.
What are cyanotoxins?
A common bacterium called cyanobacteria sometimes produces a natural poison called cyanotoxins. In mammals, exposure to cyanotoxins can cause allergic reaction and respiratory issues, and cause acute illness, including liver and kidney damage, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. With extreme exposure, symptoms may include organ failure, paralysis and even death.
Toxins in water: Salem drinking water contaminated, children shouldn't drink tap water
How long are the drinking water restrictions expected to last?
"I cannot give you a definitive answer," Lacey Goeres-Priest, Salem's water quality supervisor, told the Statesman Journal.
City officials said in an advisory posted online, "City of Salem is working closely with local and state public health and emergency response agencies to address the situation and to quickly reduce Cyanotoxin levels in tap water."
"City of Salem will post an updated advisory when: the Cyanotoxin levels are less than or equal to the national drinking water Health Advisories, this Does Not Drink Advisory is lifted and/or if there are any changes to the conditions of this Do Not Drink Advisory.
"Updates will be provided Thursday, May 31, 2018 via the City of Salem web page, CityofSalem.net; City of Salem Alert System; local media; City of Salem social media. Residents can sign up on CityofSalem.net to receive emergency alerts from the City."
The health advisory for Detroit Lake was issued last week. When did officials learn that the river water was a problem?
Water was sampled late last week and officials received the results of testing the water on Saturday, said Goeres-Priest. The results showed toxin levels were higher than a health advisory level for vulnerable communities and children, but remained below safe levels for adults.
The city has been coordinating with the Oregon Health Authority over the weekend.
After consulting with the OHA and Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday, Salem issued the advisory based on the data.
"We wanted to be proactive because we're coming up on the 10-day exposure period — if people are exposed to it for 10 days that's when the probability of health issues increases," said Greg Walsh, emergency manager for City of Salem.
May 23 health advisory: Health advisory issued for Detroit Lake after discovery of toxic algae
Detroit Reservoir has algae blooms every year. Why is it so bad this year?
"Every bloom is different," Goeres-Priest said.
They said it depends on, among other factors, the level of toxins being produced in the watershed and whether toxins are making their way all the way down the river to the water treatment facility.
"It's hard to say exactly why this year is different than last year," Goeres-Priest said. "We just know that based off the sample results that it is."
Three toxic blooms were identified in locations around Detroit Lake — at Blowout Arm, Heater Creek Arm and near the dam. That's more than in the past.
The bloom in Blowout Arm had a particularly high concentration of toxins, officials said. A liver toxin called "microcystin" was tested on May 23 at 48.21 parts per billion in that location. A health advisory is triggered when levels are just 4 parts per billion.
What is recommended for expectant or nursing mothers?
Farrer said they didn't know of good data on whether toxins can transfer from a nursing mother to their baby. But officials definitely do not want mothers drinking the water — they should stick with bottled water.
They said breastfeeding in this case is preferred to preparing formula with tap water.
Can I use my water filtration system to purify the water?
"Most water filters and purifiers will not remove this toxin from drinking water," the advisory states. "See manufacturer's recommendation for water filtration capabilities."
What is Salem-Keizer Public Schools doing for water for students and staff?
Kindergarten and younger children, as well as other at-risk children (such as those who are medically fragile) will be provided bottled water, said Joel Smallwood, manager of maintenance and construction services with Salem-Keizer Public Schools.
Schools on Keizer's water system are not affected.
Food services will use bottled water for all food prep throughout the district that's fed by Salem water, they said.
"We've got a team delivering right now," Smallwood said.
Bottled water: Officials hands-off as Salem runs out of bottled water during supply contamination
What cities outside of Salem are affected by the drinking water restrictions?
Stayton and Turner are falling in line with Salem's water advisory.
"We do test our water," said Keith Campbell, Stayton's city manager. "I don't know if it's as frequent as Salem, but our tests hadn't come up with anything."
Still, "we're going with just following the advisories with the city of Salem," they said.
David Sawyer, Turner's city administrator, said Salem officials contacted their city last week and told them about the concern.
"All of the water that comes into Salem, basically we tap into those lines as they come down the canyon. It's the same system," Sawyer said. "Because of the size of our distribution system, we're testing for E coli and we're testing for chlorine and things like that, just to make sure."
What about restaurants?
Farrer said that restaurants that use city water should not use the water to serve customers.
Health officials also are advising against using the water for cooking and washing food, they said.
Why is it considered safe to bathe and wash dishes with the water?
City officials said the water is OK to use to clean, bathe and wash dishes, as well as cleaning laundry, washing your hands and flushing toilets.
"However, infants and young children under the age of six should be supervised while bathing and during other tap water-related activities to prevent accidental ingestion of water," the advisory states.
Farrer said these toxins are not absorbed through the skin and the only way for them to get into people is if they are swallowed.
Alert confusion: Prepare for action': Vague emergency alert alarms Oregon residents
Health officials are recommending that children who are being bathed be supervised to make sure they don't drink the water, Farrer said.
Even so, a small amount of consumption is not going to be a harmful, such as the amount you swallow when washing your face or the little bit of water that gets into your mouth when you shower, Farrer said.

NU men's tennis earns NCAA Tournament bid
Northwood University announced Tuesday that its men's tennis team has earned a berth in the NCAA Tournament for the 23rd time in the last 24 years.
The Timberwolves will be the No. 6 seed in the Midwest Region and will travel to Springfield, Mo., for the first two rounds of the tournament. Northwood (16-4) will face third-seeded Ferris State, which just won the GLIAC Tournament title this past weekend, on Monday. In the other half of the Midwest Region II draw, second-seeded Drury (18-4) will take on seventh-seeded Grand Valley State (15-8), also on Monday.
The winners of those two matches will meet next Tuesday for the right to advance to the Round of 16, which will be held in Surprise, Ariz., May 9-12.
FORT MYERS, Fla. A Fort Myers-based company is creating bulletproof vests for dogs in police K-9 units across the country and giving them out for free.
The company, Survival Armor, is working with a Massachusetts nonprofit called Vested Interest In K9s to offer nearly 200 bulletproof vests this summer. Several will end up with agencies in Southwest Florida.
The vests are worth between $1,700 and $2,200, according to Cathy Lowe, Survival Armor executive vice president. The life of a police dog is worth even more, Survival Armor President Kurt Osborne said.
“Along with being a partner to a police officer, they are also a capital investment, so it's very important to protect them,” Osborne said.

SEOUL: North Korea's foreign ministry said on Wednesday it rejected a U.N. Security Council statement denouncing its latest missile launch test.
The North's state-run KCNA news agency cited a spokesperson at the ministry as saying the Sunday launch was a sovereign right and a self-defence measure.

In 1985, the Shiite Muslim hijackers of a TWA Boeing 727 beat and shot one of their hostages, U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem (STEE-them), 23, throwing them out of the plane to die on the tarmac at Beirut airport.
In 1992, during a visit to an elementary school in Trenton, New Jersey, Vice President Dan Quayle, relying on a faulty flash card, erroneously instructed sixth-grader William Figueroa to write potato as potatoe on a blackboard during a spelling quiz.
Ten years ago: During their ethics trial, a tearful Mike Nifong announced they would resign as district attorney of Durham County, North Carolina, after admitting that hed made improper statements about three Duke University lacrosse players who were once charged with raping a stripper. (The players were later declared innocent by state prosecutors.) Retired Price Is Right host Bob Barker won their 19th Daytime Emmy. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, a crane lifted out a water-damaged 1957 Plymouth Belvedere that had been buried in an underground concrete vault half a century earlier to celebrate 50 years of statehood.
Five years ago: President Barack Obama eased enforcement of immigration laws as they announced a new policy, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Republican Mitt Romney launched the next phase of their presidential campaign, kicking off a six-state, small-town bus tour and telling middle-class Americans that President Obama hadnt given them a fair shot. An armored car heist at the University of Alberta in Canada left three armed guards dead; fellow guard Travis Baumgartner later pleaded guilty to murder charges and was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 40 years. Daredevil Nik Wallenda became the first person to walk a tightrope across Niagara Falls. (The feat was broadcast live by ABC-TV, which required Wallenda to wear a safety tether.)
One year ago: The interim police chief in Oakland, California, Ben Fairow, was abruptly removed after six days on the job by Mayor Libby Schaaf, who said they had lost confidence in Fairows ability to lead the department amid a widening sex scandal in which a number of officers allegedly had sex with a teenage prostitute. A public funeral was held in Detroit for hockey legend Gordie Howe, who had died five days earlier at age 88.

PanARMENIAN.Net - A suicide bombing targeted the administrative headquarters of a tribal region in northwestern Pakistan on Wednesday, February 15, killing three police officers and two passers-by, officials said, according to The Associated Press.
The explosion went off at the main gate of the tribal headquarters in Ghalanai in the Mohmand tribal region, just as the workday was about to start, said Hameedullah Khan, a local government official.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
Khan, whose office is inside the compound, said the grounds are home to residences, offices and training facilities for the local administration and police employees. Hundreds of local residents come daily on business to the tribal headquarters, located 45 kilometers (28 miles) outside Peshawar, the provincial capital.
The bombing was followed by gunshots, Khan added. The Pakistani army said the bomber was accompanied by another militant, who tried to force their way into the compound after the explosion went off but that security guards opened fire and killed him.
The army statement said there was a higher level of vigilance among the local security forces following intelligence that would-be attackers had infiltrated the area from neighboring Afghanistan.
Wednesday's attack, and another suicide bombing that killed 13 in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore on Monday, reflect an uptick in militant attacks after almost a three-month lull.
A breakaway faction of the Pakistani Taliban — the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar or Freedom Movement — claimed the Lahore attack. Seven police officers died in that bombing, including a former chief of the province's counter-terrorism department.
The breakaway Taliban faction is based in the Mohmand area — part of rugged, lawless regions along the Afghan border which have long served as safe havens for local and al-Qaida-linked foreign militants, who have killed tens of thousands of people in over a decade.
Pakistan has waged several offensives against militants in recent years.
SINGAPORE: The Government is looking to raise standards in palliative care, working in tandem with various partners in this area and ensuring that providers are given sufficient funding support.
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a visit to Assisi Hospice on Wednesday (Feb 15), Minister of State for Health Chee Hong Tat said palliative care will become increasingly important as the nation faces an ageing population.
“We're mindful that as we look at how to transform our healthcare system, we want to move away not only from acute hospital services but towards more community care and long-term care,” they said, adding that more details will be announced at the Ministry of Health's Committee of Supply session.
They said that there needs to be a group of healthcare workers who can support the growth of this sector: “This is an area we will continue to work closely with our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and also the Singapore Hospice Council and our providers to raise standards, to attract Singaporeans to join the sector and provide continuous training.”
In response to a question about whether MediShield Life could cover care in hospices, Mr Chee said the Government would have to look at whether different types of treatment, including palliative care or other types of community care, could be included.
“The balance is of course, the more you include under MediShield Life, the higher the MediShield Life premiums will be. So, it's about striking the balance,” they said.
"We'll also be providing greater support through subsidies enhancements and also through other types of schemes, for example ElderShield (and) other types of measures to help patients when they need these services, beyond hospital beds," they added.
Research-funding agencies that require scientists to declare at the proposal stage how their projects will be “transformative” may actually be hindering discovery, according to a study by Oregon State University ecologists.
The requirement can result in decreased funding for the “incremental” research that often paves the way for paradigm-shifting breakthroughs, the OSU scientists assert.
Their findings, as well as their recommendation for how to best foster transformative research, were published recently in Trends in Ecology and Evolution.
Sarah Gravem, postdoctoral scholar in integrative biology in Oregon State's College of Science, was the lead author on the paper, titled “Transformative Research is Not Easily Predicted.”
Gravem, integrative biology professor Bruce Menge and the other collaborators note that the National Science Foundation, which funds roughly one-quarter of the federally supported research at U.S. colleges and universities, “has made the pursuit of transformative research a top priority by asking for a transformative research statement in every major research proposal solicited.”
The NSF defines transformative research as being “driven by ideas that have the potential to radically change our understanding of an important existing scientific or engineering concept or leading to the creation of a new paradigm … . Such research is also characterized by its challenge to current understanding or its pathway to new frontiers.”
Gravem says asking scientists to attempt to create new paradigms or fields in every proposal is unrealistic and potentially harmful.
The OSU scientists argue that a better approach, and one that was suggested more than a decade ago by the board that oversees the National Science Foundation, would be to create a funding subset: a separate NSF-wide program to solicit and support transformational research proposals.
“The board had been concerned that the U.S. was lagging behind other countries in scientific advances, concerned that creative and risky research was not getting funding,” Menge said. “It concluded that what the NSF should do is set aside some funds for risky research proposals, those defined by reviewers as they may or may not work, the chances are sort of slim, but they could turn out to be pretty cool.”
What the NSF did instead, Menge said, was required all proposals to show how the research being proposed would be transformative.
“Instructions to reviewers include the expectation that the reviewer will comment on how transformative the proposed research is,” Menge added.
The problem, the Oregon State collaborators say, is that it's rarely possible to know at the proposal stage whether a project will turn out to be transformative; their assertion follows interviews and surveys of 78 highly cited ecologists who began with incremental goals and only later realized the transformative potential of their work.
“To start out with that transformative question is a backward way of thinking,” Gravem said. “Surely you have to think big to come up with big answers, and everyone is striving for that, but truly transformative research is an unobtainable standard to place on people at the proposal stage. Trying to make every project paradigm shifting can mean ignoring the incremental and basic science that eventually goes into shifting paradigms. It's a detriment to ignore the building blocks in favor of the building.”
Gravem said the necessity of incremental research was also explained recently on Freakonomics Radio.
“Economist Ed Glaeser noted that Nobel Prizes are not typically given for single transformative research papers but are often given for a body of incremental research,” they said. “If transformations arise from incremental research, then the transformative criterion is redundant with the solicitation of incremental research. This is reflected by mixed evidence that soliciting transformative research led to increases in transformative outcomes compared with the typical model.”
Expanding fields of knowledge, adding to bodies of evidence, and comparing two fields that haven't been compared before are the types of gains researchers can reasonably predict, Gravem added. Being asked to forecast how a project will turn out to be transformative puts “researchers in an awkward position that nobody likes.”
“We're being forced to hype our work at the beginning of a proposal, which doesn't do anything to help science or to help build trust in science,” Gravem said. “And it turns the funding process into an essay competition that favors people who take more liberty in predicting what their research might show.”
Menge notes that NSF's plan all along was to reassess the transformative research statement requirement at some point, “and now is the time.”
“Research funding is effectively decreasing, but the demand for funding is increasing, so they look for ways to prune the field of who gets funded – I recognize that as a problem,” they said. “But making artificial hurdles is just wrong. Funding agencies should concentrate on the goals of the research rather than the unknowable outcome.”
As a French-born American citizen, Pierre said they were moved to listen to Macron on the White House lawn earlier in the day. "Last night I didn't sleep because I could feel the ghosts. I can guarantee you if one day you sleep at the White House, you will pinch yourself before you turn off the lights. Also, I wanted to be ready for this morning. We met early for hair and makeup. This is a big deal. You have to be perfect. Even if I didn't design the pieces, I wanted them to be immaculate. To represent the U.S. is a big honor and I wanted them to look their best. This morning they were stunning.  They are lovely. Listen I know a lot of people don't know her, but I'm lucky to know them a little bit."
Yan Gomes singled home Austin Jackson from second base with none out in the 13th inning as the Cleveland Indians rallied from five runs down to stun the New York Yankees 9-8 Friday and snatch a 2-0 lead in the AL Division Series.
Jackson drew a leadoff walk in the 13th from Dellin Betances and stole second. Gomes went to a full count before pulling their bouncer just inside the third-base bag, easily scoring Jackson. The Indians poured out of their dugout to mob Gomes, who ended the 5-hour, 8-minute thriller.
The Indians posted their biggest comeback win in postseason history, overcoming an 8-3 deficit, a terrible start by ace Corey Kluber and a potentially serious injury to slugger Edwin Encarnacion.
Francisco Lindor hit a grand slam in the sixth to rally Cleveland, right after a close call on a hit by pitch that the Yankees didn't challenge.
New York had its chances late, but the Yankees stranded the go-ahead run at third in the ninth and 10th — and had pinch-runner Ronald Torreyes picked off second in the 11th by Gomes from the behind the plate.
Cleveland will try for a sweep in Game 3 Sunday at Yankee Stadium. Carlos Carrasco is set to start for the Indians against Masahiro Tanaka.
Jay Bruce connected for a solo shot in the Cleveland eighth that made it 8-all. As they've done so many times in a season becoming more special by the day, the defending AL champions battled back and can now put the Yankees away in New York — just as they did in the 2007 ALDS.
Josh Tomlin, who had been scheduled to start later in the series, pitched two perfect innings for the win.
Aaron Hicks hit a three-run homer off Kluber and Gary Sanchez and Greg Bird hit two-run shots for the Yankees, who may have caught a bad break before Lindor's homer.
Down 8-3, facing New York's vaunted bullpen, the Indians came back.
New York starter CC Sabathia was lifted with one on and one out in the sixth for Chad Green, another one of the Yankees' flame-throwers who got an out before Gomes doubled. Green came inside and Lonnie Chisenhall was awarded first by plate umpire Dan Iassogna on a hit by pitch.
TV replays showed the ball slightly change direction — it appeared to hit the knob of Chisenhall's bat.
Yankees manager Joe Girardi said there wasn't enough evidence within 30 seconds to justify a challenge. They said the team later saw a slow-motion replay suggesting they should've contested the call, but it was too late.
Lindor then stepped in and hit a towering shot off the inside of the right-field foul pole to make it 8-7, triggering a seismic celebration.
As Lindor rounded the bases with Cleveland's first postseason slam since Jim Thome in 1999, Progressive Field shook the way it did last November when Rajai Davis hit a two-run homer in eighth inning of Game 7 off Aroldis Chapman, then with the Cubs and now closing for the Yankees.
When Lindor reached the plate, they wrapped their arms around Jason Kipnis waiting in the batter's box.

BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) — “You can try a different place every week and still never run out of options,” jokes Brandye Merriweather, the Vice President for Downtown Development for the Buffalo Urban Development Corporation. “It's been very interesting to see that and to see how many people are coming downtown and staying downtown longer.”
Merriweather says over the last few years the city has become a place where people can live, work, play, and eat. Since 2013, 34 new restaurants have opened in the downtown area. The VP says the trend right now is to reuse historic buildings – many eateries are opening in former warehouses which played a critical role in shaping Buffalo during its booming industrial days and now, these restaurants are playing an important role in the renaissance.
“All of these things kind of are building on each other and it's creating a massive vibrancy in downtown.”
Merriweather finds it very interesting that all of these restaurants are very different with a variety of cuisines and price points offered. And they feel as more people are making downtown their home, more options for living, playing, and dining will become available.
“People want to live near great shops and restaurants. And I think that's just a symptom of the excitement of what's happening down here.”

Anti Vehicle Lifting Staff (AVLS) Model Town have smashed a vehicle lifting gang and arrested its two members besides recovering stolen cars and motorcycles.
DSP AVLS Model Town Saleem Mukhtar Butt led a special police team which conducted a raid and arrested Azizur Rehman and their accomplice Waseem. The police also recovered five cars and six motorcycles besides illegal weapons.
During preliminary interrogation, the gangsters confessed dozens of incidents of vehicle lifting that committed in different areas of the city. The police had traced many cases against them.
DIG Investigation Sultan Ahmad Chaudhry has announced cash and commendatory certificates for raiding team. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Immigration arrested two passengers at Allama Iqbal airport here on Friday.
According to FIA spokesperson, Muhammad Akram Chaudhry, a resident of Pakpattan, arrived from South Africa through flight No EK624. During checking, their South Africa work permit No AA0067653, affixed on page No 16 of their passport, was found fake. On which the accused was sent to FIA/AHTC Lahore for further action.
Another passenger, Naveed of Mardan, was travelling to Saudi Arabia by flight WY344. During immigration clearance, their CNIC number got hit in IBM system in black listed category with remarks illegal immigrant/deported from Muscat. The accused was offloaded and sent to FIA/AHTC Lahore for further legal action.
The U.S. national team played a game it couldn't afford to lose Friday. And it didn't, overwhelming Panama 4-0 to move a big step closer to an eighth consecutive World Cup appearance next summer.
Christian Pulisic, who seemed unstoppable for much of the first half, and Jozy Altidore did most of the heavy lifting, with Altidore scoring two first-half goals while Pulisic scored one and assisted on another.
But a game was all the U.S. won and there is work that remains to be done to assure the Americans' safe passage to Russia.
With Friday's victory the U.S. vaults over Panama into third place in a six-team CONCACAF qualifying tournament that will qualify three nations for the World Cup. The Americans can secure their trip to Russia by beating Trinidad and Tobago in their final qualifier next week.
A draw likely will be enough to see the U.S. through as well because it would leave Panama needing to both beat Costa Rica at home and overcome a seven-goal margin in goal differential to overtake the Americans.
Playing before a rain-splattered sellout crowd of 25,303 at Orlando City Stadium, the U.S. was dangerous from the start, playing its most complete game of the tournament.
The Americans went in front to stay in the eighth minute on a spectacular goal from Pulisic. After taking a deft right-footed touch from Altidore, Pulisic split two defenders on their way into the penalty area, rounded keeper Jaime Penedo at the edge of the six-yard box and pushed a right-footed shot in from a difficult angle for their fifth goal of the year.
Pulisic, who turned a somersault after taking the shot, quickly climbed to their feet and dashed to the corner flag, where they were engulfed by their teammates.
The Panamanian defense, which pounded Pulisic in a 1-1 draw in a March qualifier, had no answer for the teenage playmaker Friday. Eleven after scoring, they set up Altidore for the second goal. The play started with Pulisic eluding Michael Murillo on the left wing and sending a low left-footed pass to the front of goal for Altidore, who redirected it in.
The assist gave Pulisic a hand in 11 of the last 13 U.S. goals in qualifying.
Altidore then made it 3-0 just before the half, chipping in a penalty kick after Bobby Wood was taken down by Armando Cooper in the 18-yard box. Wood then closed the scoring 18 minutes into the second half, taking a short pass from Paul Arriola with their back to the net, spinning and sending a right-footed shot by a pair of stationary defenders and into the back of the net.
The four goals marked the most Panama has given up in a World Cup qualifier since a 6-0 loss to the U.S. in October 2004 while for the U.S. the four scores equaled its total output in its previous four qualifiers. The result also ended Panama's four-game unbeaten streak against the Americans.
The U.S. didn't get out of the game unscathed, however, with Pulisic limping off the field briefly early in the second half favoring their right ankle after a strong tackle by Anibal Godoy. After a few short sprints on the sideline, they were allowed to stay in briefly before being replaced by Dax McCarty in the 57th minute.
But while Friday's win greatly improved the Americans' chances of reaching the World Cup, it didn't clinch a berth. A U.S. loss in Trinidad combined with a Panama win next week would leave the Americans no better than fourth in the standings, sending them into a two-leg intercontinental playoff against either Syria or Australia with the final World Cup berth at stake. That's the route Mexico followed to the 2014 tournament in Brazil.
And Honduras could complicate even that scenario because if the U.S. doesn't win its final game, the Central Americans could pass it by beating Costa Rica on Saturday and Mexico next week in its last two qualifiers. That could drop the U.S. as low as fifth in the standings, leaving it with no way to qualify for Russia.
But for now the Americans, who haven't gone into the final day of qualifying with their World Cup status in doubt since 1989, control their own destiny. Win and they're in; anything short of that and there's a chance they could be watching the World Cup on television.

This statement was originally published on smex.org on 8 December 2017.
On Thursday night [December 7, 2017], the Houthis, the northern Yemen-based insurgent group in control of most of Sana'a since 2015, completely shut down the internet for close to 30 minutes. Earlier in the day, the group took measures to disrupt and limit access to the internet for the second time in one week. These measures violate the Yemeni people's fundamental rights to freedom of expression and access to information. The recurring disruption of the internet makes it difficult for civilians to communicate with others and jeopardizes the fragile state of press freedom in Yemen, where a bloody conflict has raged since 2014.
The Houthi-controlled Ministry of Communications and Information Technology has a history of tightening its control over the internet. When the Houthis took over the ministry in 2015, they filtered various news sites and in April, the group temporarily shut down the internet in Aden. The Houthis repeated this tactic last night, as YemenNet, the Ministry of Communications-controlled internet service provider (ISP) - the sole ISP in the country - shut down internet across the country for around half an hour between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. UTC+3. Earlier in the week, the Houthis targeted news sites, mainly those affiliated with the General People's Congress (GPC), the party of slain former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, such as Khabar News Site, according to Fahmi Albaheth, the President of the Internet Society Yemen Chapter (ISOC-Yemen) who currently resides in Aden.
Before Thursday's shutdown, the Houthis had also been throttling, or intentionally slowing, internet speeds across the country, according to several online sources who complained that the internet has been particularly slow. Walid al-Saqaf, co-founder and chairperson ISOC-Yemen, told SMEX that YemenNet regularly throttles the internet and that this practice continued during these two disruptions.

Deteriorating state of press freedom
Prior to the shutdown, internet users were unable to reach the social media platforms and communication tools they rely on to access information and connect to each other after YemenNet blocked Facebook, Telegram, Twitter, and WhatsApp . Though the disruptions on Saturday and Thursday mark the most targeted attacks against social media, the Houthis had previously blocked Telegram and used a bandwidth control filter on Facebook, preventing multimedia content from loading. Regarding the timing of the disruptions, al-Saqaf said the decision to limit access on Thursday could be related to the mass dissemination of videos depicting atrocities committed by Houthi forces. The first restriction to the internet took place on December 2, three days after violent clashes erupted in Sana'a between the Houthis and forces loyal to Saleh, a former Houthi ally-turned-foe killed by the Houthis on December 4.Several Yemenis who spoke to SMEX relayed their inability to access social media sites without a Virtual Private Network (VPN), which enables users to bypass internet filtering and other access restrictions. However, the throttling of the internet prevents internet users from downloading VPNs from application stores, such as Google Play, which is critical because YemenNet has also blocked many VPN download pages. Yemenis who already have Tor , a free browser that allows internet users to conceal their location and browse the web anonymously, can bypass blocked websites. Al-Saqaf noted that Yemenis mainly use Psiphon , another open-source internet circumvention tool, but that most of these tools might only be available to those who downloaded them before the internet access restrictions started. However, Signal , a free and secure messaging app, is working well according to journalist Hafez al-Bukari
The blocking of news sites and social media platforms comes amidst renewed attacks on journalists. On Saturday, the Houthis fired rocket-propelled grenades at Saleh-aligned television channel Yemen Today and detained 41 journalists and media workers. In October, the Ministry of Communications outlawed the unlicensed practice of online journalism, which not only hinders reporting on the ongoing war by local journalists but also restricts activists from publishing content on public social media pages.
The climate of hostility towards journalists in Yemen predates the emergence of the Houthis. Before the rebel group took control of Sana'a, foreign journalists were routinely expelled from the country for challenging the government's official version of events. In August 2017, the Saudi-led coalition imposed a series of cumbersome, costly, and dangerous procedures to prevent journalists from entering Yemen to report on the coalition's deadly blockade and bombings campaigns. The new measures have made it nearly impossible for foreign journalists to report on the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Yemen.
The Houthis willful disruption of the internet will make it significantly more difficult for Yemeni journalists to send their dispatches from the ground to the rest of the world. Prolonged and complete shutdowns of the internet will also pose a grave threat to the safety of Yemeni civilians who at any moment can be deprived of their communication tools, which are essential to their ability to receive and share information and contact emergency services in a time of war.
Editor's Note: Internet users in Yemen who are unable to download the Tor browser can send a request to get Tor by email. Requests can be sent to [email protected] with a note specifying the required operating system. Visit https://gettor.torproject.org for more information.
Oprah Winfrey, who has publicly struggled with their weight, recalled the exact moment their relationship with food took a turn for the worse.
“I shall never forget Saturday morning, October 17,” they told Vogue, referring to the day after their film “Beloved” released wide in 1998. “I got a call from someone at the studio, and they said, ‘It's over. You got beat by ‘Chucky'.' And I said, ‘Who's Chucky? What do you mean it's over? It's just Saturday morning!' I knew nothing about box-office projections or weekend openings. It was ten o'clock in the morning, and I said to [personal chef] Art [Smith], ‘I would like macaroni and cheese for breakfast.'”
The 63-year-old media mogul continued, “And soooo began my long plunge into food and depression and suppressing all my feelings.”
Winfrey said their depression lasted around six weeks.
“I actually started to think, Maybe I really am depressed. Because it's more than ‘I feel bad about this.' I felt like I was behind a veil,” they explained in the magazine's September issue. “I felt like what many people had described over the years on my show, and I could never imagine it. What's depression? Why don't you just pick yourself up?”
They eventually started feeling better — and ultimately stopped running to movie theaters to buy up blocks of tickets to “Beloved” to boost box office sales. They took away multiple lessons after “Beloved,” which was based on Toni Morrison's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, flopped.
“That's when the gratitude practice became really strong for me,” they told Vogue, “because it's hard to remain sad if you're focused on what you have instead of what you don't have.”
They added, “It taught me to never again — never again, ever — put all of your hopes, expectations, eggs in the basket of box office. Do the work as an offering, and then whatever happens, happens.”
As colder weather begins to settle in, the State Fire Marshal's Office is reminding residents that this is a dangerous time of year for home fires. Factors such as home heating, holiday decorations, winter storms and candle usage all contribute to a greater risk of home fires.
Keep your home fire-safe this winter, and minimize the risk of fire by practicing these fire safety tips:
Candles – Consider using battery operated candles, which can look, smell and feel like real candles.
Carefully read and follow the manufacturer's use and safety instructions.
Place candles on a flat surface and in a sturdy container.
Place candles where they cannot tip over.
Never leave a lit candle unattended.
Extinguish candles after each use, when leaving home or going to sleep.
Heating – Use caution when trying to stay warm at home.
Never use an oven to heat your home.
Keep heat sources at least three feet away from anything that can burn.
Unplug heat producing appliances, and extinguish embers in the fireplace before going to sleep, when unattended, or leaving home.
Only plug one heat-producing appliance into an electrical outlet at a time; never into an extension cord.
Maintain heating equipment and chimneys in good working condition. Have them professionally cleaned and inspected once a year.
If using a fireplace, use a glass or metal fire screen to catch sparks and rolling logs.
Smoke Alarms – Make sure your home's smoke alarms are in working order.
Install alarms inside and outside all sleeping areas, and on every level of your home.
Follow manufacturer's instructions to ensure proper installation and maintenance.
Test your smoke alarm once a month to ensure they are working. Replace any alarms that fail testing.
Replace all smoke alarms that are 10 years old or older.

Lo Bosworth may not stay in touch with their former “Hills” castmates, but Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt certainly do.
On Thursday, new mom Montag, 31, revealed they selected longtime friend and Lauren Conrad frenemy, Jen Bunney, as one of baby Gunner Stone's godmothers.
“Celebrating @gunnerpratt with one of their godmother's [sic] @jennifer_nora737,” Montag shared on their Instagram story.
“We're celebrating Gunner,” Bunney said “He's the best baby ever. We love them so much.”
Bunney, 31, who was first featured on MTV's “Laguna Beach” in 2004, became a prominent fixture on the second season of “The Hills,” as their friendship with Conrad, 31, imploded after they supposedly hooked up with Conrad's then-flame, Brody Jenner.
Though Bunney found them happily ever after with husband of three years, Taylor Dunphy, they and Montag have remained tight since their days on reality TV.
Montag and Pratt, 34, welcomed their first child on Sunday, where $27,000 worth of crystals were present in the delivery room.

Norfolk staff is investigating the possibility of posting 911 civic addressing signs at the entryway to large expanses of farmland.
Waterford Coun. Harold Sonnenberg said last week that the lack of civic addressing in this area puts farmers and field workers at risk in the event of an emergency.
In a situation where minutes matter, Sonnenberg said it would be handy to be able to tell a 911 operator the precise location in the countryside where first responders are needed.
“If a combine catches fire, where does the farmer send the fire trucks?” Sonnenberg asked.
Chris Baird, Norfolk's general manager of development and cultural services, said the suggestion is worth looking at. Baird said properties marked would need a proper entrance that could accommodate emergency vehicles.
The issue was raised at Norfolk council April 17 during a discussion of changes to the county's civic addressing policies.
In their report to council, Richard Roberts, Norfolk's GIS supervisor, said the current bylaw has been in place for 10 years and needs several adjustments.
Changes approved include:
* The county has collected dozens of names of noteworthy local veterans and added them to Norfolk's street name registry.
* Sponsors of new subdivisions in Norfolk have the right to select 50 percent of the street names in their development. The developer must draw the other 50 percent from the county's street name registry. Norfolk has final say over whether these names are appropriate for the development.
* The revamped bylaw provides direction on the application of civic addressing in trailer parks, mobile home parks and campgrounds. The previous bylaw was silent in this area.
* The old bylaw triggers a report on the re-naming of a road or street if 51 percent of property owners petition for it. Because road and street re-naming can be disruptive, expensive and require legal paperwork, the threshold for a change has been raised to 80 percent. As well, the cost of renaming a street or road will be borne by the applicant.
Several years ago, Norfolk tweaked the names of numerous streets and roads to eliminate duplication.
The county did so after Bell Canada threatened to withdraw 911 emergency dialling services if duplicated street and road names weren't adjusted.
Bell Canada acted because Norfolk's towns and hamlets technically don't exist. For 911 dialling purposes, Bell Canada regards municipalities as a single community.
As such, Main Street in Port Dover was maintained as is because it is the largest of all Main Streets in Norfolk.
Main Street in Simcoe became North Main Street while Main Street in Waterford became Main Street North and Main Street South and so on throughout the county with other common street names.
During Tuesday's discussion, Port Dover Coun. John Wells asked why streets and roads were put through this exercise but Norfolk still has Bill's Corners west of Simcoe and Bills Corners south of Boston. Wells wondered if this was an oversight.
Baird explained that the problem of duplicate names only applies to roads and streets with civic addresses and not towns, hamlets and crossroads. Baird added that Bill's Corners near Simcoe is distinguished from Bills Corners on Cockshutt Road by virtue of the fact the former has an apostrophe.

Five NFL teams will be on the field for coaching instructions for the next three days.
The Detroit Lions, Indianapolis Colts, New York Giants, Oakland Raiders and Tennessee Titans kick off voluntary minicamp today through Thursday, April 26.
Teams with new head coaches are allowed one three-day veteran minicamp in which no live contact is permitted, but 7-on-7, 9-on-7, and 11-on-11 drills are allowed. The Arizona Cardinals and Chicago Bears previously held their minicamps last week.
One note from each team taking the field today:
Lions: How will the Lions defensive personnel line up with Matt Patricia's multiple-front system? The defensive line is something Detroit should target in the draft later this week.
Colts: Andrew Luck won't be on the field yet, obviously. What will Jacoby Brissett's receiving corps look like behind T.Y. Hilton?
Giants: All eyes will be on backup quarterback Davis Webb, as he's slated to get more reps this week. Even with the hype around Webb, don't expect this week's performance sans pads to change Big Blue's plans at the No. 2 overall pick on Thursday.
Raiders: What will Jon Gruden's return to the sideline look like? The Raiders new coach said they plan to use this week as a teaching lesson.
Titans: How much of the new offense will OC Matt LaFleur put on Marcus Mariota's plate right off the bat?
TAGBILARAN CITY, Bohol- A female environmental lawyer was shot and killed by still unidentified gunmen while they were driving their three young children home in the capital city of Tagbilaran in Bohol on Wednesday afternoon.
Mia Manuelita Cumba Masacariñas-Green, 49, died after they were repeatedly shot in the head and body.
Them children aged 9 and two-year-old twins were unharmed but shocked and shaken.

Superindent Nicomedes Olaivar, Tagbilaran police chief, said they have yet to determine the motive in the killing.
They said they would check the cases they had handled to find out if the killing was job-related.
Masacariñas-Green was known as an environmental lawyer when they were a member of the Environmental Legal Assistance Center (Elac). They had also handled civil and criminal cases.
Olaivar said the lawyer was driving their children home to Centro 1, Dampas District, Tagbilaran on Wednesday when their Toyota Innova (plate number ABM 9572), upon reaching the corner of H. Zamora Street and J.A. Clarin Street in Dao District at 4:27 p.m., was blocked by armed men riding in two motorcycles who immediately fired at them the moment they stopped their car.
The armed men kept on shooting at the lawyer, in the presence of their terrified children who were seated at the passenger seat in the back of the vehicle.
Olaivar said witnesses told the police that the assailants' motorcycles did not have plate numbers. They fled towards Corella town. At least 24 empty shells were recovered from the crime scene.
Masacariñas-Green was rushed to the Holy Name University Medical Center where they died, Olaivar said.
Olaivar said investigators were yet to determine the motive behind the attack as manhunt operation had been launched against the gunmen.
“She was really a passionate and devoted lawyer,” said lawyer Ted Lagang, president of the Integrated Bar of the Philippine (IBP)-Bohol chapter.
Bohol Provincial Board Member Abeleon Damalerio, who rushed to the hospital upon hearing what happened, said Masacariñas-Green was a lawyer devoted to their profession.
“She was always prepared for the cases they were handling. Them level of devotion to their cases could not be questioned,” said Damalerio.
Lagang condemned the killing and called on authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice.
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysians watched live on Wednesday as Najib Razak headed to court to face charges linked to a corruption scandal, an extraordinary event in the swift downfall of the former prime minister since they lost an election less than two months ago.

Najib, 64, was charged with three counts of criminal breach of trust and one of abuse of power in connection with the scandal-plagued state fund 1MDB.
They have denied any wrongdoing and says the charges are politically motivated. They pleaded not guilty to all charges.
National television networks broadcast pictures of Najib's convoy as it moved through morning rush-hour traffic to the court in the capital, Kuala Lumpur.
Online news portals posted live updates of the scene outside the court where scores of journalists and onlookers waited for Najib's arrival.
Wearing a dark blue suit, Najib smiled and waved to the crowd as police escorted them into the court.
The charges were read out to Najib in a sessions court, before moving to the High Court where an official read out the charges again. Najib, standing and nodding occasionally, pleaded not guilty.
Three of their children - Ashman, Nooryana Najwa and Nazifuddin - watched the proceedings in the packed court.
Najib's wife, Rosmah Mansor, who is also being investigated in the 1MDB case, was also at the court.
Malaysians said the charging of Najib, the son of the country's second prime minister, was the latest surprise since a May 9 election swept them from power.
“So, @NajibRazak becomes the first ever former Prime Minister to be arrested. Yet another piece of history written for #MalaysiaBaharu (New Malaysia),” said one Twitter user called Sheikh Shamir.
Fahmi Reza, one of several political satirists who faced fines, legal action and jail terms for mocking Najib, went to court to see Najib charged.
“I'm at KL Court today as a citizen who has been silenced, persecuted & sentenced to jail for speaking up against @NajibRazak,” Fahmi said on Twitter.

“I'm here to hear the corruption charges that is finally being brought against him.”
PUBLIC GLARE
The 1MDB investigations have gripped the nation, with the help of a newly unshackled mainstream media that is closely tracking Najib's downfall.
News of Najib's arrest on Tuesday was splashed across the front pages of newspapers, something unimaginable just eight weeks ago.
Under their leadership, the Barisan Nasional coalition lost an election for the first time since it began governing in 1957 following Malaysia's independence from Britain.
Days after they were sworn in as prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, a former premier who came out of retirement to oppose Najib, restarted investigations into 1MDB and barred Najib from leaving Malaysia.
Najib's family homes have been searched in full public glare, with police seizing millions of dollars in luxury items.
Outside the court on Wednesday, about 100 Najib supporters held placards calling for their release.
“This is unfair ... They are trying to get them on whatever charge they can,” said Suhaila M. Zin, 43.
Some Najib supporters disrupted a news conference by Attorney General Tommy Thomas, creating a ruckus until police cleared them out.
Thomas spoke briefly in English to say they would take questions from reporters. They left as chants of “Melayu” resounded, a seeming insistence that they speak in the Malay language.
Thomas is the first non-Malay to hold the post of attorney general since 1963, and their appointment faced opposition from some groups representing the ethnic Malay majority.
After seven hours in court and being granted bail of 1 million ringgits ($247,000), Najib left looking relaxed. They're even speaking briefly to reporters.
“Today, I have been officially charged. This is something I had expected, because that is the intent of the new government,” they said.

“I believe in my innocence and this is the best chance to clear my name,” they said, waving off questions with a smile.

VICTORIA – Effective Nov. 30, 2017, the British Columbia government will end grizzly bear trophy hunting throughout the province and stop all hunting of grizzlies in the Great Bear Rainforest, Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development Minister Doug Donaldson announced Monday.
“By bringing trophy hunting of grizzlies to an end, we're delivering on our commitment to British Columbians,” Donaldson said. “This action is supported by the vast majority of people across our province.
“In particular, we owe it to generations past and future to do all we can to protect the beauty and uniqueness of the Great Bear Rainforest. We believe the action we're taking goes beyond the commitment to Coastal First Nations made as part of the 2016 Great Bear Rainforest agreements.”
There are an estimated 15,000 grizzly bears in British Columbia. Each year, approximately 250 are taken by hunters. While the trophy hunt will end, hunting for meat will be allowed to continue.
During the fall months, Donaldson said that government will consult with First Nations and stakeholder groups to determine next steps and mechanisms as B.C. moves toward ending the trophy hunt. Additionally, government will be moving forward with a broader consultation process on a renewed wildlife management strategy for the province.
“The key elements of that strategy will include dedicated funding for wildlife and habitat conservation and a collaborative process in developing short and long-term plans for wildlife resources,” Donaldson said.
LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — A Las Vegas cab driver is being called a hero for what they did the night of the mass shooting.
Knowing there was an active shooting going on, John Zerquera-Jimenez drove into harm's way to help a desperate father find their daughter.
Then they went back and did it again.
Father: “Hurry up there's a shooting going on there.”
Zerquera-Jimenez: “Somebody's shooting?”
Father: “Yes, get me there as fast as you can, my daughter is calling me.”
It was a father's frantic plea to a complete stranger: drive toward the danger.
Zerquera-Jimenez stepped on the gas, on board with the mission to help the man find their daughter.
Father: “Hey, listen, they don't know where these shooters are. I don't want to get you. I don't want to get you ***** up. You're driving on your own.”
Their face was unfazed by their petrified passenger. Meanwhile video from another cab picks up the unrelenting sound of bullets pouring from the sky.
Eleven agonizing minutes later, they find Ashley, along with five other girls trying to escape.
Father on the phone: “You see it? Yeah, hurry up, get in, that's us. Get in, Ashley gets in, everybody gets (bleep) in.”
“I say, ‘Jump to the car! If you want to stay alive, jump to the car,'” Zerquera-Jimenez said.
The girls frantically pile on top of each other.
Daughter: “They were shooting everywhere, just get us away from the Strip.”
That, they did.
Zerquera-Jimenez transported another five people to safety that night.
After the chaos, they received the following text message:
“Thank you so much for being so brave to come toward to the shooting to rescue us. You are a hero and my family and I will always be grateful for your bravery that night.”
Zerquera-Jimenez says they just did the right thing.
“I feel in peace and glad for 11 people that are still alive, but I'm so sad for the other (58) people die, the other (58) families they lose their loved ones,” they said.
Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday expanded their Council of Ministers by inducting three new faces ahead of the Assembly polls slated later this year.
BJP legislators Balkrishna Patidar, Narayan Singh Kushwaha and Jalam Singh Patel were inducted as Ministers of State and administered the oath of office by Governor Anandiben Patel at a function in the Raj Bhavan in bhopal on Saturday morning.
Along with Chouhan, senior ministers of their Cabinet and top officials were present on the occasion.
Patidar, who belongs to the Nimar region, is an MLA from Khargone, while Kushwaha comes from the Gwalior-Chambal region and represents Gwalior South in the Assembly.
Another inductee Jalam Patel hails from Mahakaushal region. The MLA from Narsinghpur, is the younger brother of BJP MP and former Union minister Prahlad Singh Patel.
The expansion is being seen by some as an attempt by the BJP to balance regional aspirations of the people of the state, where Assembly polls are expected by the year-end.
The Congress had opposed the expansion of the Council of Ministers in view of enforcement of the model code of conduct in two Assembly constituencies — Mungaoli and Kolaras — where bypolls are scheduled on 24 February.
The Chouhan government, in its third term, has 20 Cabinet ministers, including the chief minister, and nine Ministers of State. According to constitutional provisions, the state can have a maximum of 35 ministers.
The BJP is in power in Madhya Pradesh since 2003.
LAS VEGAS — Demetrious Johnson chasing an unprecedented 11th title defence and a headline fight that could decide Conor McGregor's next opponent top a UFC 216 card set for Saturday in Las Vegas, an event playing out in a city still reeling from a mass shooting in which 58 people were killed and nearly 500 were injured.
The mixed-martial arts promotion has pledged $1 million to help victims and their families, UFC President Dana White said. The pay-per-view card is one of many events that quickly resumed in Las Vegas after the shooting on Sunday, including a major casino conference, magic shows and concerts and a Los Angeles Lakers practice game set for Sunday in the same T-Mobile Arena where UFC 216 will take place.
"I'd say to the people outside of Las Vegas: Don't be afraid to come here," White told TMZ as they pledged the donation.
The main event will be a contest for the interim lightweight title, as second-ranked Tony Ferguson (22-3) fights seventh-ranked Kevin Lee (16-2). Ferguson has a nine-fight win streak coming into the bout, and the winner could ultimately fight against megastar Conor McGregor to unify the belt.
Ferguson has already been arguing for that for the winner on Saturday, as McGregor mulls their return to MMA after a highly popular crossover boxing match against Floyd Mayweather in late August.
"The real righteous thing to do is to make sure the belts become unified," Ferguson said. "That's what really needs to happen."
Johnson, nicknamed "Mighty Mouse," is tied with MMA legend Anderson Silva with 10 consecutive title defences, which Silva accomplished in the middleweight division. Johnson, 31, is considered by many to be the top pound-for-pound fighter in the sport, having not lost a fight in more than six years.
 They are the only flyweight champion in UFC history, winning the inaugural title against Joseph Benavidez in 2012 as the promotion expanded weight divisions. Johnson has rarely been tested during this run and is a heavy favourite facing third-ranked flyweight Ray Borg (11-2).
The two were originally scheduled to fight at UFC 215 one month ago, but Borg fell ill shortly before the fight and withdrew. The fight was quickly rescheduled and added as the co-main event for this weekend.
"I'm happy the UFC got it rescheduled super-fast," Johnson said.

Jonathan Tasini, a left-wing author and writer/talking head for CNN, celebrated the news that Republican lawmakers were on board a train that crashed Wednesday morning. “Wow, btwn train full of Goopers hitting truck and this, God is working hard today to clean up the stink. Thank them #TreyGowdy#goptrainwreck.”
A number of people were injured in the crash. There was one fatality.
Tasini later deleted the tweet and apologized while blaming their tweet on “the deep racism/hypocrisy/criminality promoted by GOP.”
On their verified Twitter account, the hard-left author describes themselves as a “Bernie Sanders surrogate.” Their profile photo is a picture of themselves with their arm around Sanders. Tasini wrote the book The Essential Bernie Sanders and Their Vision for America.
WEST SENECA, N.Y. (WIVB) — The phone rings inside the SPCA of Erie County and Sara Dayton picks up, kindly greeting the person on the other line who is calling to donate to the animal shelter.
“We're looking for a lot of traffic and a lot of donations today,” said Dayton who is the board chairperson and a volunteer at the SPCA.
She's spending their day there as she's helping out with the organization's largest fundraiser, their radiothon. Throughout the day, calls will come in from all over as people want to provide support for the animals at the SPCA.
“We often get young girls and boys who call in, who heard about the radiothon on the radio or TV and they want to give us everything in their piggybank. So it's only like $3.26 but it's their life savings at that point and they're using it to help out these animals and it's just so wonderful.”
The SPCA relies on the community support to stay open and provide care and assistance to the animals which come in. Most of the money raised goes toward vet bills as all of the animals are neutered or spayed and up-to-date on shots before they head out and find their forever homes.
“There are so many animals who come in who are victims of neglect and they need a home,” said Dayton. “When we are able to adopt out an animal, we have an open space for another one to come in and we can help find that one a home too. So whatever anyone can give, it's important and makes a difference.”

A tiny Newfoundland village is hoping to quickly remove the massive body of a humpback whale that has been stuck there since last fall, fearing the impending odour and mess as warmer weather approaches.
The whale's body was frozen and covered with snow for the winter months in Nameless Cove, but has become an urgent issue for the village.
“The warmer temperatures are coming and you obviously know what's gonna happen next,” Hank Diamond, a member of the local service district committee, said Wednesday.
“You won't be able to live in that community in the summer, probably, if you don't move it.”
Nameless Cove is waiting on a price quote from contractors, and Diamond said the community is hoping for provincial assistance to remove the sizable creature that they estimate to be 25-30 feet.

“It would take a fairly fair sized vessel to move that off the beach even at high tide, you know, and it seems to be settling in the sand more, so it's gonna be harder and harder to get outta there, and it's starting to rot.”
The body is in close proximity to some residences, wharves, and is less than 100 metres from a graveyard.
The beach is also a tourist attraction for its proximity to Flowers Island. The whale's body is currently in the line of vision for anyone hoping to snap a photo of the island's famed lighthouse.
Diamond reached out to Service NL after Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) told Nameless Cove the removal of the whale carcass is the municipality's responsibility.
In an e-mailed statement, Service NL said it is working with the district and “the whale will have to be moved and disposed of, either by towing it to a more secluded location to decompose or by burial.”
Dead smelly whales are not uncommon an issue for seaside Newfoundlanders: Last June, a dead humpback was lifted by crane in Outer Cove, N.L., and taken to a disposal site.
But small communities like Nameless Cove, armed with tiny boats and a population under 100 people in northern Newfoundland, are faced with a difficult task when whales wash ashore.

Diamond said DFO officials visited the site last fall to assess the beached whale, leading many locals to believe they would return to remove the body in the spring. Then villagers were surprised and upset when DFO told them it fell outside the department's responsibility.
“It's like Russian roulette, whatever community it lands on, it's on you,” Diamond said.
So far, Diamond said the response from Service NL has been encouraging. But the town needs to move fast on the difficult removal, with or without the government's help.
“If they support it or if they don't, it's got to move,” said Diamond. “We'll see to it I guess.”
