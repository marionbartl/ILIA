Truck Yeah The trucks are good!
On a little stretch of road in Sweden, cables have been strung up about 18 feet over the asphalt to feed trucks with electricity. While connected, the trucks will run off the grid instead of their own engines.
The trucks are hybrid-electric big rigs running off natural gas and battery power on normal roads most of the time. But when they hit the wired portion of the highway, a power-collecting antenna called a pantograph is extended and connected to run the truck like a city tram.
Vehicles will be able to drive at 55 mph while hooked up to the overhead wire, according to Gas2.
This technology has been in development for years as a collaborative project between Swedish vehicle manufacturer Scania and German tech outfit Siemens. Extensive prototype testing has already taken place at Siemens' research and development facility outside Berlin, and as of June 22nd the system has been implemented on a public highway in Sweden.

So far the cables only cover two kilometers (about 1.2 miles) of the E16 highway in a Swedish coastal town called Gävle, but interested parties are hoping to extend it to about 110 kilometers (about 68 miles) to the industrial town Borlänge, reports Sveriges Radio.
A Magnus Ernström, project manager from the local government explained to the station:
“On this stretch of road, we have a lot of our heavy industry that has a need to transport a lot of goods and the railroad going the same direction is already full, so we see this as a flexible railroad.” “Heavy traffic needs a lot of energy and you have to have a conductive technology if you want to run them on electricity today, that is; you need to have a connection between a wire and the system in the truck. If you ran a heavy truck on battery, it would need 20 tons of battery to transport maybe 30-40 tons of cargo, so you would not have so much room left for the cargo.”

Sounds like Ernström would not think the Nikola One self-charging electric big rig is practical.
For now, the Swedes plan to test the electric highway for two years and presumably measure everything about how it's working in the “real world.”
Apparently the country is eyeing “a fossil-fuel-free transportation system by 2030,” of which an electrified road system could be a component.
The Philadelphia Eagles roster is set at the 90-man limit and at this point in the offseason there aren't many moves to be made, so I thought it would be useful to take a look at the Eagles cap situation heading into 2014.
According to Overthecap, the Eagles own $19,428,064 in cap space, which is good for the 6th highest total in the NFL. Only the Jaguars, Browns, Bengals, Jets, and Titans have more room to spend. Around the NFC East, the Dallas Cowboys have the 12th most space ($10,270,424) after an offseason of cutting costs. The New York Giants brought in a lot of new faces through free agency and rank 21st in cap room ($6,894,422). The Washington Redskins were also spenders in free agency and own the NFL's 4th least amount of cap room ($2,472,256).
As far as dead money goes, the Eagles rank near the middle of the pack with $9,453,783. A large chunk of that comes from the Eagles' release of DeSean Jackson ($6M). Had the Eagles not released Jackson, they would have been in the top five teams with the least dead money. Danny Watkins, Patrick Chung (if he doesn't make the Patriots roster), Jason Avant, Curtis Marsh, Jordan Poyer, David King, and Bryce Brown all account for some dead money.
It's good to see the Eagles have a lot of money to spend moving forward because they have a number of players who could be up for extensions following the 2014 season. One of those players includes quarterback Nick Foles. QBs tend to be very expensive and Foles won't come cheap. Brandon Boykin, Fletcher Cox, Mychal Kendricks, and Cedric Thornton are a few other names to consider.

Another reason I wanted to post this cap update is because the great Eagles salary cap tracking site known as EaglesCap.com will be shutting down. EaglesCap, run by Bryce Johnston, was such a great resource for Eagles fans and it will truly be missed. The good news is that Johnston will be taking his services to Overthecap, which now provides the information that EaglesCap won't be anymore.
Still, it's a little sad to see a site like EC go because it represented the passion of the Eagles fan base. Johnston opened the site not with his own gain in mind but to provide a free and reliable service to the diehard Eagles fans who wanted to know more about the team's cap situation. Here's the message Johnston posted on his site:
Dear Users of the Site,
After 10 off-seasons of Eagles salary cap coverage, I am announcing at this time that I am no longer going to continue to maintain eaglescap.com. The Allen Barbre extension is the last contract that I am going to enter onto the site, and in August I am going to cancel the domain name. So if you would like to record any information for your own use, please do so shortly. I will be happy to continue answering questions via e-mail and Twitter.
I now strongly endorse overthecap.com as the most reliable and comprehensive source of Eagles contract and salary cap information. Overthecap.com provides such information for all 32 teams, and does so with tremendous accuracy and thoroughness, rendering sites like this one obsolete.
From this point forward I will be contributing occasionally to overthecap.com. I will write some Eagles-focused pieces, but primarily I will write about contract structure and cap management strategies in a non-team-specific sense. I will also remain active on Twitter.
I would like to thank all those who have used the site thoughout the years, e-mailed me with questions or suggestions, and interacted with me on Twitter. This decision is bittersweet, but I think the timing is right.
Bryce Johnston
Best wishes to Johnston moving forward. Follow him on Twitter: @eaglessalarycap.
A still from the BuzzFeed Motion Pictures series, 'Lesbian Princess.' | BUZZFEED SCREENGRAB BuzzFeed fires two amid video push
Two popular producers and personalities for BuzzFeed — Jenny Lorenzo, a writer, producer and actor for the company's English-speaking Latino-interest channel, Pero Like; and Brittany Ashley, a producer and actor who most recently wrote and starred in BuzzFeed web series “Lesbian Princess” — had for months been leading BuzzFeed's expansion into content aimed at Latino and LGBT viewers.
That is, until Friday — when BuzzFeed suddenly fired them both.
Story Continued Below
According to several people close to the company, the abrupt departures were due to Lorenzo and Ashley appearing in “Gente-Fied,” a seven-episode web series being produced by actor America Ferrara.
Both Lorenzo and Ashley took small acting roles in the miniseries, and both appeared briefly in a trailer that was released in May. (Coincidentally, a BuzzFeed article promoted the series in which they were involved.) According to people close to the company, Lorenzo and Ashley's involvement in “Gente-Fied” constituted a breach of contract because of a non-compete clause most BuzzFeed Motion Pictures staffers are required to sign.
The departures have reignited a debate about the increased prevalence of non-compete agreements in industries like media and entertainment — agreements that were once reserved for high-level tech and engineering jobs.
It is an early test of the mash-up of Silicon Valley and Hollywood culture, as well-funded digital media companies like BuzzFeed are paving inroads to the more traditional television and movie-making industries.
The two former BuzzFeed employees did not publicly share many details about their departure from the company, likely because of non-disclosure agreements the company that sources say some employees are required to sign.
“I no longer work for BuzzFeed/Pero Like,” Lorenzo wrote on Facebook Friday morning. “But will continue to make content on the Aggressive Comix channel and will always strive to make Latino content. I love you all. Thank you for your support.”
Ashley signaled her departure less directly.
“If there was ever to be a day that I would get a "~No Regretz~" neck tattoo, I think today would be that day,” she wrote on Twitter.
Some employees told POLITICO they were taken aback by the firings, and said they weren't aware of the reach of the non-compete clause until Lorenzo and Ashley were fired. Others said that the non-compete clause is enforced unevenly by management, and that the agreement is vague about what constitutes as a competing project.
“It's a big gray area,” one said. “There are a lot of people who do acting gigs on the side and haven't gotten in trouble.”
Laura Zak, a writer, producer and actor who has appeared in several BuzzFeed shorts, called the firings “BS” on Twitter and criticized the company's non-compete agreements.
“Read your contracts, & don't be seduced by ‘but, exposure!'” she tweeted.
According to people familiar with BuzzFeed's standard agreement, BuzzFeed Motion Pictures employees aren't allowed to work for companies considered to be competitors for three months after leaving the company. A similar non-compete policy at Law360 drew ire in February when a junior employee who had left Law360 for Reuters was fired over a non-compete agreement. At the time, The Wall Street Journal reported that New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman was investigating those types of non-compete agreements.
Update: Law360 announced Wednesday that it would stop making new employees sign non-compete agreements.
BuzzFeed has a strict exclusivity agreement for some of its most popular talent that is, according to The Hollywood Reporter, “designed to help [BuzzFeed Motion Pictures] retain its top talent even as they become internet sensations and begin to field offers from both traditional and digital suitors.” But only a handful of BuzzFeed's biggest stars have signed that agreement, which is different from the standard contracts most BuzzFeed Motion Pictures employees are required to sign.
A spokesperson for BuzzFeed could not say how many people within BuzzFeed are required to sign non-compete and non-disclosure agreements.
BuzzFeed also owns the content its employees produce when working for the company. When web personality Matt Bellassai put BuzzFeed's popular “Wine About It” series on hiatus to pursue other opportunities, he had to leave the franchise behind. Lorenzo and Ashley, similarly, don't have the rights to the projects they worked on while at BuzzFeed.
Some people see that as the bigger reason to stay away from working at the company.
“I warn my bright young friends not to get involved with @BuzzFeedVideo," tweeted Jen Richards, the creator of web series Her Story who has previously appeared in BuzzFeed productions. "It's unrelentingly exploitative of their talent, drive, and hunger ... You're much better served in long run by creating your own content & owning it. You deserve better."
In the end, it wasn't even close.
St. Louis Cardinals fans – enduring a month of voting by readers of Ball Eight – were chosen as the “Most Insufferable Fans” in baseball.

Bill O'Reilly in 2015. (Richard Drew/AP)
Media critic
Bill O'Reilly's lawyers knew him well.
According to testimony from an executive with 21st Century Fox, a contract for the fallen King of Cable News contained a helpful provision stating that he “could not be dismissed on the basis of an allegation unless that allegation was proved in court.” The revelation stems from a proceeding of Britain's Competition & Markets Authority (CMA), which is reviewing a bid by Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox to assert control of the portion of satellite TV outlet Sky that it doesn't already own. As part of the review, Jacques Nasser, a director of 21st Century Fox, gave testimony on the company's inner workings.
And what astonishing workings: As Nasser told the story, there was a quick reaction to the accusations against former Fox News chief Roger Ailes, who was sued by former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson in July 2016. After a review of Ailes's conduct, he was quickly ousted.
Such a lightning response, however, wasn't possible in the case of O'Reilly, Nasser told CMA, because of O'Reilly's contract. Requiring sexual-harassment allegations to be proved in a court of law before dismissing the accused party — that's a steep requirement. Analyses have shown that well above 90 percent of all civil cases are settled or dismissed before they reach a trial. Not only that, but a wealthy man like O'Reilly can use his assets to ensure that he'd never face a proven claim of sexual harassment.
“He would never let a claim go to trial where he would even have the slightest chance of losing,” says Lisa Banks, a partner at the employment law firm Katz, Marshall & Banks.
The anomalous employment history of O'Reilly at Fox News provides powerful context for what Nasser revealed. As the New York Times reported in April, there were at least five settlements involving O'Reilly's treatment of women, and several of them were negotiated directly between O'Reilly and the accuser. Those revelations triggered calls for action against O'Reilly advertisers, and the pressure forced Fox News to fire O'Reilly. The story stood right there for months, until the New York Times revealed last month that O'Reilly had in January agreed to another, astounding settlement with legal analyst Lis Wiehl for the sum of $32 million. Though O'Reilly's bosses were aware of the Wiehl accusation, they were kept in the dark about the settlement amount. They re-upped with the newsman anyhow, in a four-year deal that paid him $25 million per year.
In response to that story, 21st Century Fox issued a statement saying, in part, “His new contract, which was made at a time typical for renewals of multi-year talent contracts, added protections for the company specifically aimed at harassment, including that Mr. O'Reilly could be dismissed if the company was made aware of other allegations or if additional relevant information was obtained in a company investigation.” In his remarks to the CMA, Nasser confirmed that “a clause was inserted to state that he could be dismissed on the grounds of an allegation against him without it having to be proved in court,” according to the summary provided by the CMA. From the looks of things, the contract that contained the court-proof provision was negotiated between Team O'Reilly and Fox News; the 2017 version was negotiated with greater input from 21st Century Fox.
What progress.
That O'Reilly ever had a prove-it-in-court provision says a great deal about: 1) His lawyers, who knew how to protect him; 2) Fox News, which should have seen the provision as fair warning and a potential legal liability: “Fox lawyers and executives knew that this was a big issue if they were signing a contract with him with this type of provision,” says Banks; 3) The ways in which the legal system accommodates rich people; as premier thinker Tom Scocca wrote, settlements are a “Get Out of Jail Free” card for accused sexual harassers such as O'Reilly. And to think: O'Reilly has bashed this very system for unduly empowering complainants to bring frivolous complaints against celebrities.
And 4) the malignant Fox News culture of ratings. With very few scoops and little in the way of journalistic integrity, Fox News has always fended off the attacks of critics by pointing to its preeminence in the ratings. As the Fox News sexual-harassment saga drags on, we learn more and more about how low its executives will stoop in order to preserve this distinction.
Recent investigations have shown that sexual harassment is a media-wide phenomenon. The New Republic, NPR and ABC News are among the outlets where sexual harassment has taken place. Fox News stands apart, however, for the institutional sanction accorded to the creepy office pursuit of innocent and hard-working women.
The story of Thomas Hardy's Ale
The label reads "In 'The Trumpet Major' Hardy wrote of Dorchester strong beer 'It was of the most beautiful colour that the eye of an artist in beer could desire; full in body, yet brisk as a volcano; piquant, yet without a twang; luminous as an autumn sunset; free from streakiness of taste, but, finally, rather heady".
The refurbishment of the Trumpet Major pub in Dorchester was the catalyst for the fledgling Thomas Hardy's Ale. 1968 was the 40th anniversary of the authors' death and what better way to commemorate it than by attempting to bring fiction to life and creating the brew that Hardy imagined.
This was to be no ordinary ale. Matured in oak sherry casks for nine months and corked in decorative pint and half pint bottles. The strength was a whopping 12% and it was bottle conditioned. Thus the legend began and bottles were laid down with the expectation of improvement as the beer matured.
Most of the production did not consist of the larger corked bottles with their beautiful velvet neck ribbons but small nip size crown corked bottles with a black and gold neck medallion. This depicted a silhouette of Thomas Hardy on one side and the brewery address on the reverse. This was to become a distinctive feature of Hardy's Ale bottles, but it was only the 1968 edition that displayed the date on the medallions.
Hardy's Ale was not produced again until 1974 but with the exception of 1976 appeared annually after that until the final vintage of 1999. Word of mouth spread the tale amongst connoisseurs about this wonderful strong ale, the one that extolled us not to drink it for 5 or 10 years and proclaimed that it would keep for 25 years!
Although the reputation of Thomas Hardy's Ale grew the instruction to lay it down before drinking may have unwittingly helped to contribute to its downfall. People bought a few bottles as souvenirs to be put away for some special occasion in the future, but others wanted something more instantly accessible. The "don't drink yet" instruction was quietly dropped during the 1980's. Conversely the need to cellar the beer led to many bottles surviving as their owners forgot about them or when the special occasion did arrive, could not bear to part with their prized possession.
It was not just in Britain that the reputation of Hardy's Ale grew. 25ml bottles were introduced for the European market, and later the 33ml size for the United States. In fact, Phoenix Importers who now commission the new Thomas Hardys' Ale from O'Hanlons, imported some of the 1st vintage in 1968.
Portugal: General strike ahead of Congress budget vote
By Paul Mitchell
24 November 2010
In what has become a pattern across Europe, the unions in Portugal have called a one-day general strike today, November 24, in advance of a budget vote in Congress on Friday. The union bureaucracy's aim is not to mobilise opposition to the government, but to let off steam while they continue to collude with austerity measures.
José Sócrates, Prime Minister of the Socialist Party (PS) government, claims austerity is needed to cut the deficit from 9.3 percent of national output (GDP) in 2009 to 7.3 percent this year and then to 3 percent in 2012, the maximum permitted under European Union rules. Sócrates explained that “the central goal is to shield the country from the international financial crisis. The goal is to reach the end of next year with this budget executed and to have one of the smallest deficits in Europe.” He warned that the Portuguese government could be forced to withdraw from the euro if the 2011 budget was not passed.
The working class faces a mauling in pursuit of this goal. The latest austerity measures are the third set in just one year. They include cuts of up to 10 percent in public sector wages, a 2 percent rise in the goods and services (VAT) tax to 23 percent (some foodstuffs will jump from 6 percent), a freeze on pensions, cuts in family allowances, further cuts in healthcare, education and local council budgets and the privatisation of more state-owned assets. There are also plans to abolish the agreement on the minimum wage and stop it rising from the current €475 ($645) a month to €500 ($680) next year.
Sócrates has called the present situation “the worst crisis in 80 years” and warned that “the country could lose independence if it is unable to convince the international markets.” By this he means that Portugal may have to turn to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Central Bank for a loans and guarantees package to stave off state bankruptcy, as has happened to Ireland this week and Greece in May. Following concerted campaigns by the money markets and rating agencies to downgrade government bonds and push countries towards bankruptcy, the Irish government has officially applied for a further bailout package of up to €90 billion ($109 billion) from the European Union and IMF. In May, Greece accepted €110 billion ($150 billion).
The opposition right-wing Social Democratic Party (PSD) has vocally opposed the PS for being too soft on public spending cuts and for excluding items such as the losses of state companies from the overall public debt. The PSD says the debt is 112 percent of GDP―far higher than the government's figure of 82 percent and way above that of troubled Ireland. However, PSD leader Pedro Passos Coelho is instructing his deputies to abstain from voting on Friday―aware that a defeat for the minority PS government would force Sócrates to resign and possibly place them in a position where their posturing as opponents of austerity would be exposed in office. In the interim, Portuguese capitalism would be further politically destabilised. Parliament would have to be dissolved, in a situation where new elections are forbidden under the constitution in the six-months leading up to the January 2011 presidential elections.
Western governments, financial institutions and the bond markets have all stepped up the pressure on the PS to strengthen its assault on the Portuguese working class. United States President Barack Obama took time off from last weekend's NATO summit in Lisbon to meet with Sócrates and praise him for his commitment to “a very vigorous package of economic steps”.
The current austerity measures are just the start. The IMF has warned that new measures will be necessary next year. It criticises Portugal for having “the eurozone's most rigid labour markets” and productivity stuck at 64 percent of the eurozone average, unchanged since the early 1990s when the country lost masses of low-tech jobs to China and East Europe. The President of the Euro Group, Jean-Claude Juncker, declared that the country had to adopt “further ambitious structural reforms, focusing on removing rigidities in the labour market and in wage negotiations.”
The bond markets have driven Portugal's borrowing rate to a historic high. The yield on 10-year Portuguese bonds―how much it costs the government to borrow―is about 7 percent, compared with 8 percent in Ireland and over 11 percent in Greece. In Germany it is 2.7 percent.
Currently, Portugal's public debt stands at €165 billion ($223 billion), about the same as its GDP in 2009. The current measures reduce public spending by just €12 billion ($16 billion). In addition, private debt is one of the highest in the world, at 239 percent, much of which is owed to foreign financial institutions.
In many respects, Portugal is in a worse position compared to the other countries that have experienced sovereign debt crises. The per capita GDP is just $21,700, compared to $41,000 in Ireland and $31,000 in Greece. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on Thursday forecast Portugal's economy would shrink by 0.2 percent in 2011 after growing 1.5 percent this year.
Unemployment already stands at nearly 11 percent or 610,000 workers―the highest level for at least two decades. The unemployed have had their benefits slashed and are forced to take any job they are given or face losing their payments.
The working class wants to resist the government onslaught. In March 500,000 public sector workers carried out a 24-hour strike. Tens of thousands marched through Lisbon, Porto and other cities on September 29 during the European Trade Union Federation's so-called day of action and similar numbers on November 6. A recent poll shows that support for the PS has fallen more than 10 points to 25 percent since it was elected six years ago. Sócrates' personal rating has slumped to 17.8 percent. Last year the PS lost its absolute majority in Congress elections leading to increased votes for the PSD and for the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) and the Left Bloc (Bloco de Esquerda, BE) which doubled its number of deputies to 16. The abstention rate was 40 percent.
Anger amongst workers has forced the PCP-led Confederation of Portuguese Workers (CGTP) and the smaller PS-aligned General Workers Union (UGT) federations to call the first joint general strike in 22 years. Back in 1983, the unions were able to divert a wave of social unrest that erupted when dire economic problems led to the intervention of the IMF. The SP was elected, with Mário Soares as Prime Minister, which then proceeded to implement the IMF's dictates. From 1985-1995 Soares was president. Today he is touted as one of the left's “historic representatives.”
Recently Soares criticised the government's budget saying it was a “time bomb”, which will have “unforeseeable consequences in the social arena.” He warned Portuguese political parties and unions “whether supporting the government or from the opposition” to join their European counterparts “to create a movement of opinion” against the “economicist” practices of the European Central Bank and the European Commission “before the revolts by young people, the unemployed, or simply those who feel the injustice of the restrictions, turn into violent, uncontrollable or desperate actions, as it seems is the case in France”.
A crucial role in covering for the treacherous role of the trade unions in attempting to prevent such a scenario is being played by the fake left groups. The Pabloite “Council of the Revolutionary Socialist Political Association”, formerly the Revolutionary Socialist Party (PSR) and which is a key component of the Left Bloc, argues that nothing much can be done and that “We have to recognize that our field of battle is more reduced than it was five or ten years ago”. It covers for its prostration to the government saying, “The Left Bloc will choose in its own time the forms of confrontation with the government. “
The Portuguese section of the Committee for a Workers International, Socialismo Revolucionario (SR) criticises the CGTP and UGT for months of inaction and failing to take advantage of “the tremendous opportunity to call a general strike on the same day as the Spanish general strike” on September 29 and the PCP and Left Bloc because they “hardly used their influential position to mobilise people or publicise the protests”. In the next breath it declares “We call on the CGTP and the left parties, namely the PCP and the Left Bloc, to join their forces in order to provide the mass of working class and youth a clear plan of action.”
As history shows and millions are experiencing across Europe, there is no way that organisations like the PCP or Left Bloc can provide a “clear plan of action”. The main reason why the militant actions of workers in Greece, France and elsewhere have come to nought has been the bankrupt perspective of “pressurising” the union leaders and the Stalinist and middle class parties, which are opposed to any genuinely effective movement of the working class. A new socialist party is needed and new organizations that can draw broad layers of the working class into industrial and political struggle against the capitalist governments throughout Europe and internationally.
The war waged by political reactionaries and pro-life advocates against Planned Parenthood in the United States is widely known. I wrote about it a couple of weeks ago, and the undercover videos attempting to show the organization in a bad light are only the latest in a longstanding campaign. Planned Parenthood, which provides health care to millions of American women, has been under threat for years. It has always fought back.
What is less well known is that Canadian sexual health clinics, which offer many of the same vital services as their U.S. counterpart (but not abortions), are under similar threat. Earlier this month a group of Canadian sexual health clinics got together to talk about the increasingly difficult obstacles they face, from cuts in funding to harassment by anti-choice opponents to donors who are suddenly spooked by the Planned Parenthood controversy south of the border.
Many of the clinics in Canada have long since dropped Planned Parenthood from their names, and even the ones that proudly maintain the title aren't officially tied to the outfit in the U.S. But still the stigma remains, and many are struggling. Some have cut services; some have closed, or fear they will have to.

"It's getting quite desperate. We're all feeling the bite," said Lauren Dobson-Hughes, president of Planned Parenthood Ottawa, which recently put out an urgent appeal to its supporters for funds. Planned Parenthood Ottawa, which provided counselling and sex education to 8,500 clients last year (not to mention distributing 72,000 free condoms) has seen its government support slashed by 10 per cent in each of the past few years. The United Way in Ottawa cut all its funding a few years ago. Other grant applications have gone unanswered, and donors are spooked by the very words "sexual health."
According to Planned Parenthood Ottawa, there has been a concerted effort by anti-choice advocates to badger agencies and donors that might otherwise provide financial support to clinics (even though they don't provide abortion services.) As well, there is just a general leeriness around the subject of sex education – witness the vehement opposition to Ontario's new curriculum. Donors are risk averse in tough times. "For some donors, it's just easier to support something like a cancer charity," said Ms. Dobson-Hughes.
The result of dwindling funding is that the people at greatest risk suffer. One client, a pregnant sexual assault survivor in an abusive relationship, recently had to be turned away from the Ottawa clinic because there were no counsellors to see her.
This squeamishness may seem difficult to believe in 2015, but other sexual-health providers – the ones who give out free condoms, and counsel nervous teens and pregnant women, and offer screening tests for people who might not have a doctor – confirm that it's a dire time. In April, Health Initiatives for Youth Hamilton, the country's oldest birth-control clinic, had to shut its doors after it lost its local government funding. It had been running for 85 years.
In March of last year, it looked like the doors of Victoria's Island Sexual Health Society would also shut when it faced a funding crisis. After a public appeal, it received a small boost from the province's health coffers. "The immediate threat is over, but we had to lay off staff and it's still a struggle," said Bobbi Turner, who's been the director of Island Sexual Health for 21 years.
Ms. Turner's clinic had 27,000 patient visits last year, and provided sexual education for thousands of students. Like similar outfits, it offers education and pregnancy counselling and clinical services like STI testing and cancer screening. One of the problems in Victoria, she said, is the lack of family doctors: "If we close, where are these people supposed to go?"
Now the clinic is exploring "different revenue streams," including selling a line of sex toys. It's not exactly a viable alternative to stable, year-on-year funding, but desperate times calls for innovative measures.

In a tight-fisted world, it seems that women's health services – even with their long-term, quantifiable benefits – are the first and easiest things to cut. "Funding dollars are getting smaller and smaller," Ms. Turner said. "It's the same old story. Prevention gets bumped to the bottom of the list, and it's not until we're about to close our doors that people take notice."
The huge, impoverished country of Mali looks like the new frontier in the fight to control the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. The virus has killed thousands in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the three countries where the virus first emerged, but it has not gained much of a foothold elsewhere. Small outbreaks of 20 cases in Nigeria and a single case in Senegal were declared over in October. Now the potential for many more cases in neighboring Mali has health authorities scrambling to contain a small outbreak before it can get very far.
That will be challenging. At least six people have died from Ebola in Mali already, and the country's health officials, aided by American and international advisers, are racing to find, test and isolate, if necessary, hundreds of people exposed to an infected cleric who died in Mali last month after traveling there from Guinea. Many of the people had engaged in ritual washing of the dead imam's body, a particularly dangerous practice since the corpse is apt to be highly infectious and the mourners rarely wear protective clothing.
The dangers in Mali caused leaders in the United Nations and the World Health Organization last week to temper their earlier optimism that worst-case outcomes might be avoided if 70 percent of the dead could be buried safely and 70 percent of the sick treated by Dec. 1. Now they express doubts that the targets can be met and talk about containing the epidemic by the middle of next year.
Dr. Margaret Chan, the director general of the W.H.O., traveled to Mali on Friday to encourage health workers in the anti-Ebola effort. The United Nations said it will open an emergency response office in Mali this week, signifying its importance as the latest battleground. The next 15 days are deemed critical for ending Ebola transmission in Mali, the United Nations says.
LIMA (Reuters) - Charles Zevallos, a politician in Peru's Amazon basin, often wins kisses from female supporters, but things have moved to a whole new level as women at his rallies have started throwing their underwear at him.
Zevallos, a candidate for mayor in the province of Maynas, has made a tradition of giving fans, watches or soccer balls at his rallies in exchange for women's kisses.
But in the past few days, some supporters have taken off their underpants and tossed them to him during rallies for his progressive party, 1000 Movimiento Integracion Loretana.
Zevallos has downplayed any resemblance to Tom Jones, the Welsh crooner who for years was showered with women's panties while performing at pop music concerts.
Commentators in Peru's capital of Lima, 990 miles from Maynas, said the underwear throwing was proof that politics in the Andean country had reached a new low.
“It was spontaneous, I didn't ask for them, but then I saw a pair of yellow ones, and then another woman threw another pair at me,” Zevallos said.
He said he cannot be blamed for having zealous supporters.

A US military tribunal has sentenced a self-confessed Islamist militant to 40 years in jail on charges that include murdering a US soldier and conspiring to commit terrorist acts.
Canadian Omar Khadr, now 24, pleaded guilty to the charges at the Guantanamo Bay tribunal last week.
However, Khadr's plea deal limited his sentence to eight years.
Caught in 2002 at the age of 15, he is the fifth Guantanamo inmate to be convicted at the military tribunals.
Omar Khadr indicated that when he heard about the reward, he wanted to kill a lot of [Americans] to get lots of money Plea document Path ahead for Khadr
A seven-member military panel deliberated for nearly nine hours over a two-day period before reaching its decision on Sunday.
Khadr admitted five war crimes charges, including conspiracy with al-Qaeda terrorists and murder in violation of the laws of war.
Under his plea deal, the native of Toronto is expected to be sent home to Canada after serving one year at Guantanamo Bay.
The widow of US Army Sgt First Class Christopher Speer, the soldier who Khadr admitted killing with a grenade in Afghanistan in 2002, cheered as the jury's decision was read out in the courtroom.
The US is the first country since World War II to prosecute a person at a war crimes tribunal for actions allegedly committed as a juvenile.
'Bad men'
In a statement accompanying last week's plea, Khadr acknowledged that he was ineligible for protection as a prisoner of war under the Geneva conventions because he was not a member of an organised regular fighting force.
He admitted to training for combat, building and planting bombs, attacking US troops in a firefight at a compound in Afghanistan in July 2002, and having worked as a translator for al-Qaeda and another militant faction.
Khadr, originally from Toronto, had lived in Pakistan and Afghanistan with his father Ahmad Khadr, described by US authorities as a high-level al-Qaeda militant with links to Osama Bin Laden. Ahmad Khadr was killed in 2003 in a firefight with Pakistani troops.
"Khadr indicated that his father made statements that the training was to be used in attacks against the Jews because the Jews are always fighting," the plea document stated.
Khadr also said he had been told about a $1,500 (£950) reward for each American killed.
"Omar Khadr indicated that when he heard about the reward, he wanted to kill a lot of [Americans] to get lots of money," the document said.
It added that no civilians or members of coalition forces had been injured or killed by bombs planted by Khadr and his team.
But it stated that during the fatal July 2002 firefight, Khadr could have surrendered.
Instead, he stayed to fight, throwing a grenade that killed Sgt First Class Speer. Khadr was wounded by US fire and captured at the conclusion of the battle.
Khadr's lawyers said he was a child soldier forced to fight by his family. They said he was a boy intimidated by "bad men" who ordered him into battle.
Destination America "Paranormal Lockdown" investigators Katrina Weidman and Nick Groff in front of the abandoned Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum in Weston, West Virginia, where they attempt to "talk" to spirits.
As anticipation builds for this summer's remake of "Ghostbusters," real-life spirit investigators -- and their alleged quarry -- arrive on your television screens tonight in Destination America's "Paranormal Lockdown."
Throughout this six-part series, Nick Groff (Travel Channel's "Ghost Adventures") and Katrina Weidman (A&E's "Paranormal State") confine themselves in some of America's more creepy and terrifying places for 72 continuous hours.
"We do a tremendous amount of work on the history, the background, the deaths there, or anything dramatic that took place at a location," Groff said on the "Paranormal Lockdown" site. "We're going into locations to try to document groundbreaking evidence of the paranormal -- something that hasn't been discovered yet. That is my mission. I'm looking for something that will revolutionize the way we think."
In the following video from the first episode of "Paranormal Lockdown," Groff and Weidman find themselves in the abandoned Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum in Weston, West Virginia, where they appear to have a "conversation" with spirits from the beyond.
The hunt to prove, once and for all, that ghosts exists -- or to answer the deeper question of whether humans somehow survive physical death -- also takes Groff and Weidman into a Kentucky flophouse, an Ohio Victorian mansion, and other supposedly haunted locations.
"If we could capture an entity -- a solid figure on camera -- with the high technology that we have now that we're using, then possibly we can discover something new," Groff said.
"Paranormal Lockdown" premieres Friday, March 4 on Destination America at 10 p.m. / 9 Central. Check your local listings.
When I wrote my Kubuntu Vivid review, I mentioned a tool called KDE Connect, which I wasn't quite sure what it was supposed to be doing. A bunch of you emailed me, telling me it's a nice little applet that can keep your smartphone notifications in sync with the desktop, as well as allow you to remotely control certain parts of your KDE-flavored desktop from the smartphone.
This sounds quite interesting, so I decided to give it a try. The word smartphone in the prior paragraph should not be synonymous with just any mobile operating system. At this point, it's Android, so it's pure luck that I have a spare Samsung S5 lurking about, which we will test and discuss separately. At the moment, let's focus on what KDE Connect can do.
Setting up
On your Plasma desktop, KDE Connect is already installed. Just fire it up. On your Android, you will find the namesake application in Play Store. Download it and launch it. To be able to see other devices, you will need to join the same Wireless network. Bluetooth connectivity might also work, but from what I've read, I wasn't able to confirm this.
Once you have both devices connected to the same network, they will see each other. Initially, the devices will be unpaired, and you will have to authorize the bonding. Like in Star Gate, with the human host and Goa'uld.
The pairing in a necessary security precaution, as you may have additional Android devices on your network, but then, it would probably make sense to keep them all in sync with one another. This is very similar to any sort of same-network sharing, including various media and display protocols.
Plugins
There are multiple things that KDE Connect can do from your desktop, and likewise, things you can do on the smartphone once connected. Different plugins are used, and they let you display notifications about system updates, missed calls, messages, battery meter, and more. You can also use the smartphone as a mouse pad, or control the media player on the desktop. For the latter to work, Amarok or VLC must be running, or you will not be able to do that.
Moreover, most importantly, you need to allow KDE Connect to access your system notifications center, otherwise you will see an error, and the only active plugin will be the battery meter. After you approve the additional access, you will then see the rest of it, which is handy, especially if you like to keep things tidy and managed from one central place.
Using KDE Connect
Now the fun bit. Does it work? Well yes. You will indeed get popup messages notifying you about your smartphone activities, like when you take screenshots or receive messages. You can then play music, from your smartphone, on your desktop, and you can even control the volume. Or control the cursor.
Alles Klar Herr Kommissar?
Well, not everything was perfect. The first time I tried to allow my laptop to access the phone, the network crashed, and the two devices lost their pairing. Then, when copying files from S5 to the desktop, Baloo terminated unexpectedly, twice with a repeatable segmentation fault.
Some of the functionality should be streamlined, like the fact you need to separately launch a media player. It would be nice if you could do that from the smartphone, without manually fiddling with programs. Likewise, the initial notification sync. It stems from the lack of permissions, so there's really no reason for the ‘failed to load' error, as it does not feel professional. There should be more focus on offering a seamless, transparent experience.
Overall, KDE Connect behaved fine, but it wasn't stable and robust enough. Even tiny glitches and network interrupts give it a sort of beta feel. Then of course, being able to use your smartphone in this manner is a useful thing. However, only one operating system is covered at the moment. It would be great to see all other big players included, and of course, let's not forget Ubuntu Phone, either.
Conclusion
I like the concept. KDE Connect is a bold move into the mobile space, but then, Plasma has always been present in the smartphone space, or at the very least, non-conventional, non-desktop domain. We may one day see a fully fledged KDE offering on a phone, which could be a neat thing. In between, KDE Connect offers mobile users an easier way to integrate their devices into their operating system ecosphere. Being able to do this on a Plasma desktop is a bonus.
Of course, the program should definitely be renamed to reflect the new product tree, and it needs more polish and love. Namely, various bugs and problems should be fixed, smoothed, made redundant, because all and any error that users see will just drive them away toward simpler, more transparent solutions.
But it's a neat, practical first step. Now, let's see if it can mature and grow to include all the other mobile platforms, and then, extend the functionality across the board. Not just media player, but maybe a whole media center. Perhaps Plasma Media Center, on your phone? Now, things start to look quite interesting. I shall definitely keep an eye on this little thing. Oh, many thanks to all of you who have bothered emailing me and exposing me to KDE Connect. Stay tuned for updates.
Out Tonight: Vietnam '65, Pixel Heroes, Twilight's Last Gleaming and more... By Dave Neumann
Remember when Owen compared the graphics to mini-golf ? That was a long time ago.
has the distinction of being the App Store's version of The Man Who Killed Don Quixote , with the difference being that Vietnam '65 is releasing today whereas Terry Gilliam's pet project isn't scheduled to release until next year. Since last summer, Vietnam '65 has been submitted to the App Store with a scheduled release date , and then pulled before its release while a new publisher was sought. Eventually, Slitherine took the reins , updated the graphics and, finally, tonight we'll see the fruit of their labor.Vietnam '65 is a different kind of war game, one in which you need to control not only the strategic aspects of fighting a war, but also the political aspects and trying to keep the locals on your side. It looks pretty nice, too. Vietnam '65 will be for iPad, but I can't find a link so I'm not sure of a price. Guess we'll find out tonight.More of what we can expect on tonight's App Store after the break.has one of the greatest trailers ever. Or it might be one of the worst. I don't know, but I can't stop watching it. That said, actual information about the game is pretty light. Who cares, though. I'm going to go watch it again.Egad, that was fun. Anyway, back to Pixel Heroes. This is a rogue like RPG in which you build a party of characters from over 30 different classes. When a character dies, however, they're gone for good. Sounds a bit like an 8-bit version of The Darkest Dungeon , with a sense of humor and without the over-the-top narration. It's been available on Steam for awhile now, with good reviews, so this is one that will definitely be getting picked up. It will be available for iOS Universal and should run somewhere in the $5-$7 range (it's $9 NZD).is the digital port of Decision Games board game of the same name . TLG puts you in the shoes of the Americans or British during the pivotal battles of the War of 1812. There are 5 tutorial missions and 10 regular missions which you can play as either side. The game offers a ton of different troop classes from infantry to British rocket units. Give the trailer a watch; there's something about the look of this game that intrigues me. Everything is sharp and crisp and it just looks better than most of the hex war games I've seen. Then again, it could just be me. I'm on my 2nd pot of coffee. Since lunch.Twilight's Last Gleaming is coming out for iPad and costs $10 isn't normally the kind of game we would talk about here at Pocket Tactics; it looks to be an endless runner in the same vein as Tiny Wings . That said, watch this trailer. Sure, the game might not be our cuppa tea, but can you resist that shredding guitar? Did I mention the giant bear? Seriously, give the trailer a look and then try to not download RAD Boarding at midnight. It appears to be both free and radical, so why not?
In the past few months, you may have seen Youtube videos have been popping up left and right showing drivers in Florida passing through DUI checkpoints without having to submit to the standard inconveniencies normally associated with DUI checkpoints.
One video in particular (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqEXTVe7MCQ) has been view more that 2.2 million times and has inspired others make their own videos driving through DUI checkpoints, most of which are similar in content.
So what's happening in these videos?
Drivers pull up to DUI checkpoints and instead of rolling down their windows to speak to the police and possibly give a breath sample, they motion to a Ziplock baggie dangling by a string from the top of the closed window.
The checkpoint officers look at the baggie which contains several items; a driver's license, proof of insurance, registration, and the “fair DUI flier.” The flier, created by Boca Raton defense attorney, Warren Redlich, states in bold lettering, “I remain silent. No searches. I want my lawyer.”
After inspecting the contents of the baggie, the officers wave the motorists through the checkpoint.
Although many of the YouTube videos show officers waving motorists through the checkpoint without incident, many law enforcement agencies take issue with the approach claiming that it's a way for drunk drivers to avoid arrest.
Redlich, however, created the “fair DUI flier” to protect sober motorists from a false arrest. “People don't realize that innocent people get arrested for drunk driving; it happens a lot,” said Redlich and I wholeheartedly agree.
I've said it before on this blog before that I, and other DUI defense attorneys, have defended many people where the arresting officer “observed the objective signs of intoxication” and it was later determined that the person was well below the legal limit or even sober. So why give them the opportunity to “observe” the bloodshot eyes, hear the slurred speech, smell the alcohol, etc.?
“If you don't roll down your window and don't speak, you've taken away some of those,” Redlich told NBC affiliate WTVJ.
Redlich's method doesn't sit well with Sheriff David Shoar of St. Johns County and president of the Florida Sheriffs Association. Pointing to the Michigan Department of State Police v. Sitz case that I mentioned in my last post, Shoar told the associated press, “[Motorists] wouldn't be allowed out of that checkpoint until they talk to us. We have a legitimate right to do it.”
Sorry, Mr. Shoar, you're only half right.
Sure, law enforcement has a legitimate right to set up checkpoints. They do not have a legitimate right to force motorists to talk to them. In fact, it is the people's constitutional right not to talk to law enforcement. And Redlich's flier only ensures that people exercise their constitutional rights.

A Turkish Airlines flight touched down with an unexpected passenger, and its crew couldn't have been more thrilled.
The plane's crew helped deliver a baby girl about halfway into their flight from Guinea to Burkina Faso, the airline announced on Friday. The two West African countries are about 300 miles apart.
The mom was reportedly 28 weeks into her pregnancy when the Boeing 737's crew noticed that she was in the pains of labor. The jetliner was cruising at an altitude of roughly 42,000 feet at the time, the BBC reported.
Turkish Airlines Four members of Turkish Airlines staff are seen welcoming an unexpected passenger following a mid-flight delivery.
“They promptly responded to assist her childbirth during the flight,” the airline said in a statement.
Photos posted on social media by the airline on Friday captured the precious cargo being swaddled in a blanket while held by various members of the crew ― many of their faces unable to contain their shared joy.
Another photo appeared to capture the mom lying across three seats while cradling her baby among the crew's staff, which included a pilot.
Turkish Airlines This baby girl will have a unique story to tell all her life after being born aboard an airplane, mid-flight.
Once the plane landed, mom and baby were taken to a hospital in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso's capital. Both were said to be in good health, NBC News reported.
It's not clear whether there was a doctor on board to assist with the delivery, or whether the crew was trained for such surprise events. A request for comment from the airline on Sunday was not immediately returned.
According to the Turkish Airlines website, expectant moms that are less than 28 weeks along are free to travel without pause. Those between 28 weeks and 35 weeks are required to obtain a doctor's note that declares them fit to travel.
If you're wondering whether this traveling newborn will get free flights for life, it's been known to happen. Snopes, however, has reported that nothing is guaranteed.
Code42, the company behind the CrashPlan online backup service, stopped accepting new subscribers for its CrashPlan for Home plan on Tuesday, with the backup firm shifting its focus away from consumers to enterprise and small business customers.
The CrashPlan website advises users that, effective as of August 22, Code42 will no longer accept new CrashPlan for Home subscriptions nor renewals of existing subscriptions. The sunsetting of the service will apparently take place over several months, with CrashPlan for Home expected to cease on October 23, 2018.The service will continue to honor existing CrashPlan for Home subscriptions during this time, and has extended customer subscriptions at no extra cost by 60 days, to give users time to transition to a new backup system.For customers wanting to stay with the service, Code42 suggests they move over to CrashPlan for Small Business , which costs $10 per month per device. Customers choosing this option will have their data moved over and will be able to use CrashPlan for Small Business for the remainder of their current Home subscription for free, followed by a 75 percent discount off the service for the following 12 months. Carbonite is being offered as an alternative option, selected as an "exclusive partner" to Code42 for home users. Just as with CrashPlan for Small Business, subscribers are being offered a price cut for switching services to Carbonite, this time a discount of 50 percent, though customers won't be charged until their CrashPlan for Home subscription expires.For customers who have a CrashPlan for Home subscription that extends beyond October 22, 2018, CrashPlan will automatically upgrade their account to the Small Business plan before the end-of-support date."The needs of our business and consumer customers have diverged dramatically in the past few years," said Code42 president and CEO Joe Payne about the end of the consumer service. "With the rise in threats facing organizations today, we are uniquely positioned to deliver the data security and visibility solutions those organizations require. This continues to fuel our high growth and is driving our strategic decision to focus solely on business and education markets.""We worked hard to find the best possible alternatives for CrashPlan for Home customers as we transition out of the consumer market."
The very peculiar platypus (image: Dave Watts)
Life for the duck-billed platypus has never seemed easy.
With its bizarre bird-like beak, mammalian fur and reptilian gait and egg-laying habits, the platypus long mystified natural historians, who were unsure of its origin, or place in the world.
When the first platypus was shipped to the UK from Australia, people thought it was a joke and that someone had sewn a duck's bill to a mammal's body, so the story goes, while the animal has in the past been hunted by European settlers on the Australian continent for its fur.
Now it seems life may be about to get a little harder for this strange-looking monotreme.
New research suggests that climate change, specifically the warming of the Australian continent, may have a previously unrecognised damaging impact on the platypus.
In short, the platypus likes the cool waters of the rivers and streams in which it lives. And as temperatures rise, life in these waters may literally get too hot to handle.
Is Bitcoin Where The Smart Money Is Now?
There's been a lot of news about Bitcoin, including new guidance from the IRS. So is it time to get some of that digital cash? The Wall Street Journal's Michael Casey speaks with host Michel Martin.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
I'm Michel Martin, and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Now we'd like to turn to matters of personal finance. It turns out that money is more than what you have in your pocket. Today we want to take a look at the digital currency known as bitcoin.
Digital currency has been around since 2009, but there are signs that it could be gaining broader acceptance in the marketplace. For example, there's an MIT project in the works to give each undergraduate student $100 of bitcoin in the fall. So we wondered if bitcoin is where the smart money is now.
Here to talk about that is Michael Casey. He is a columnist for the Wall Street Journal, and he's written extensively about bitcoin and other digital currencies. Welcome. Thanks so much for joining us.
MICHAEL CASEY: Thanks for having me, Michel.
MARTIN: So I understand that you actually own some bitcoin. How did you end up with this?
CASEY: Well, we talked about this beforehand where I had to give a disclaimer as if I am some sort of, like, big, high-rolling investor in bitcoin.
MARTIN: Exactly.
CASEY: Well, actually, I own about $40 worth. I bought $200 worth as part of a trip to Miami where there was a bitcoin conferencing on. And I figured I want to - if I'm going to write about it, I should figure out how it works. Of course I bought when it was at about $850.
I think I bought a few hamburgers and maybe a drink or two with bitcoin, and now it's all fallen down - all the way down to $400. So not exactly one of my most successful investments, but hardly one that's going to really break the bank.
MARTIN: Well, that's a relief. I'm so glad to hear it so we don't have to lend you some money to get back to the office. So first of all, what is it? I mean, is bitcoin the only digital currency?
CASEY: Well, no, it's not. It actually can be replicated fairly easily because it's an open source software. It's a program that can be reproduced. But what is it? It's - I was calling it digital cash. It's digital cash for a digital age - is the slogan some of us have fallen upon. The way to think about it is to focus on that word cash because what cash is is an absolute transfer of value between two people.
When you walk over to somebody in the street and you say, here's $10, as you may do to a complete stranger, no one's going to have to step in to the middle of that transaction and verify who either of you are and ensure that that money is truly worth what it is. You both recognize its value. We've never been able to figure out how to do that through, you know - through the centuries basically. And certainly, when we got around to the electronic age, we had to do it through e-commerce. And so we lay it on top of it all these banks and credit cards and payment processes and all these third-party institutions who had to verify the identity of the users and the credit worthiness of the various participants, all of which is extremely cumbersome and therefore very expensive and not necessarily visible.
Of course you do pay. You pay by way of higher prices for things. You pay by way of interest rates on credit. There are all sorts of ways in which the economy as a whole is burdened by the very expensive and cumbersome process of shifting money around the world.
Bitcoin is not necessarily going to be the answer. It has enormous flaws and all sorts of risks associated with it. But it goes to the heart of this particular problem. And the great promise is that it will liberate money. And that is profound because there are all sorts of people around the world who do not have access to the same financial infrastructure that you and I have.
MARTIN: You mentioned earlier that your own adventure in bitcoin has not always gone so smoothly, and that's been true of a lot of people. A major bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox went bankrupt earlier this year. They said that they lost 750,000 consumer-owned bitcoins. Only 200,000 have been recovered. Why do you think that is?
CASEY: It's unregulated. And it's a - it's unregulated because no one quite knows what it is, right. So we have a very - I wouldn't say antiquated - but we certainly have a regulatory framework that is out of touch with what this thing is. We don't even - we really can't quite conceive of it from a legal perspective. So as a result, the various businesses that have built up around it are operating in ways that - it's like the Wild West, you know. It's actually a kind of lawless environment.
So Mark Kapeles, the CEO who was also the CIO and the CFO and the compliance officer kind of rolled into one and was running this thing without any of the checks and balances that needed to be there. So that's why people are now talking about the next phase of bitcoin or, let's say, the next phase of digital currencies.
MARTIN: So finally, another big development - Bloomberg announced at the end of April that it will list bitcoin prices on its data terminals. And as we mentioned, that whole - this idea at MIT to give the undergraduates, each of them, $100 in bitcoin because we assume that these students are early adopters will kind of figure out interesting things to do with it. Do you see those as significant steps or is that still kind of the, you know, we're let's say...
CASEY: Are we talking about our hovercrafts so now here?
MARTIN: Exactly. Right.
CASEY: Are we talking about our Jetsons flying...
MARTIN: Exactly.
CASEY: ...The cars. Maybe, you know, but I think it's - everything has to start somewhere. And these are important steps because it's all about being acknowledged and given legitimacy. The whole point about money is it needs to have trust associated with it. And trust is something that you earn. And you earn, in our contemporary society, through the recognition that comes from certain institutions.
And in the world of Wall Street, Bloomberg is a very, very important institution because it's on every trader's desk. So if you have a price now being quoted on Bloomberg - although you could've just found that same price on the Internet if you wanted to - it's now being given something of a stamp of approval. And that I think is significant. I mean, it doesn't sound like there's anything concrete there, and there isn't.
But money is a failing, you know, nebulous concept but yet an extremely important one. And so the extent to which we build kind of communal and societal faith in whatever it is we're going to use as money, the greater it can arise as an institution.
MARTIN: Michael Casey's a columnist for the Wall Street Journal. He was kind enough to join us from our studios in New York City. Michael Casey, thank you.
CASEY: Thank you, Michel.

Vermont Medical Marijuana Guidelines Released New guidelines will allow dispensaries to open; attempt to prevent federal raids
BURLINGTON, VT — After much anticipation, the Vermont Department of Public Safety has released guidelines for forthcoming medical marijuana dispensaries in the state. Vermont legalized medical marijuana in 2004, and the program's 400+ patients have since been self cultivating their medicine, or having registered caregivers grow it on their behalf.
Under the guidelines, up to four medical marijuana treatment centers will be allowed in the state. The guidelines were written by the Vermont Department of Public Safety, who also oversee the Vermont State Police, and were written to help prevent the federal raids that are currently taking place in other medical marijuana states.
Because the guidelines were written from a policing agency should help protect patients, and their medicine.
Article continues after ad Advertisement
“They did a real good job,” says Vermont resident, and registered medical marijuana patient Mark Tucci. “They went from the perspective of what's best for the patients first. Second — how do we avoid diversion.”
Under the guidelines, up to four non-profit medical marijuana treatment centers will be allowed to open in the state, and could be open as early as this summer.
The new rules will mandate background checks, significant video security and one-at-a-time appointment-only service at the dispensaries. Patients will still be allowed to grow their own medicine if they choose to do so.
Under Vermont's medical marijuana law, only patients suffering from the most severe ailments, such as cancer, multiple sclerosis or AIDS, are eligible for the medical marijuana program. There is currently discussion within the Vermont legislature to allow treatment for PTSD, as well.

Vermont's medical marijuana law has a limit of 1,000 registered patients. There are currently a little over 400 patients registered in the state.
Patients are currently allowed to have two mature plants and seven immature plants growing in an indoor, secure facility. Patients can possess up to two ounces of harvested marijuana, as well.
Patients and advocates say they would like the state to make available product testing, a delivery system and an alternative method of receiving medicine for those who grow their own but suffer crop loss.
When she was sexually assaulted, Amber Amour, 27, turned to social media for support. Here, she tells Marie Claire why she chose to #BREAKFREE from Shame.
‘The first time I experienced sexual violence, I was 12 years old, so confronting rape has been a life-long thing for me. Then, when I was 24, I started my campaign – ‘Stop Rape. Educate' – in September 2014, after I was sexually assaulted by my roommate in New York, and I just didn't appreciate the way the police handled the situation. I'll never forget calling 911 and reporting my assault – only for eight male officers to turn up at my door. I was like, ‘OK, I said the rapist wasn't here, so I don't need eight of you, and at least send one woman, please?' I don't think they realised how traumatic it is for a survivor.
But then it got worse. One of the officers asked me if I was ‘sure' that my rapist had known I meant no. ‘Maybe he thought you meant yes,' he said. I remember looking down at his wedding ring and thinking, ‘if your wife says no, do you keep on going? Do you disregard that?'. Then, after all that, they ended up dismissing the court case anyway.
I felt that if I wanted to get justice, I needed to take things into my own hands. So I started doing chalk art – writing messages about rape culture and respecting women – all over the streets of NYC. It was therapeutic for me, and eventually it took off, so I developed a social media following of women and men who felt the same way that I did. We all believed that we needed to speak out and eliminate the shame that surrounds sexual assault. I'm starting organising events, talks and art therapy sessions in New York. After eight or nine months, I asked my followers – I think I had about 5000 of them at the time – where they wanted me to take my campaign, they voted for Australia, South Africa, England, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. So I planned a ‘Stop Rape. Educate' World Tour.
Things didn't work out as planned. The tour had been going brilliantly, and I was halfway through when I reached Cape Town. I'd been staying at a hostel called ‘Carnival Court', but it's a noisy, jam-packed place, so I moved out and just went back to hang out at the bar instead. I was actually looking for a friend, when I went up to the third floor – and a local South African man followed me. To cut a long story short, we ended up in the bathroom and that's where he assaulted me. I don't even know how to explain it. It was just completely unexpected.
I immediately knew that I couldn't keep what had happened a secret. Here I was, telling survivors every single day that they should speak up… I knew I had to practise what I preached. So the first thing I did was take a picture and write a post, describing what had happened.
It was almost an intuitive thing. I was still in the bathroom – in the crime scene. I don't even think I'd stood up. I just typed and typed.
I told the story truthfully – I wanted to convey the message that no matter what a person does, they do not deserve rape, they did not ask for it, they did not put themselves in a situation. There were definitely details I could have left out – there were definitely details I wanted to leave out – but I knew that if I wanted to create a culture of consent, I had to tell the whole story, exactly the way it happened.
But that's not to say it was easy. Not everyone got the message. Some of my followers were totally supportive, but a lot of people weren't. I think I'd expected some negativity, but I didn't realise how badly it would affect me – I thought I could handle it, but I couldn't. After a few days, I gave in and took a break from social media. My head was all over the place.
It's been six weeks now, and I'm still in Cape Town and back online. I'm still trying to deal with the police, and I'm still trying to move on. My posts from the rape are still on Facebook and Instagram. As far as coping goes, it's sort of helped that I've survived rape before, because I know I can survive this. But at the same time, it doesn't make it easier. So I just have to stay focused, otherwise it's really easy to slip into depression and just relive the whole thing, over and over again.
I've always taught people that healing is an active thing – you can't just ignore it and hope that it will go away – you have to actively work towards it. So when I'm doing that, I feel great. Sometimes you're going to have emotions come up and that's a part of the process. I confront them and then I'm fine. But when I'm not focusing on healing, that's when I don't feel good, because the thoughts and the flashbacks take over. So I try to do yoga and meditation – art therapy is one of the biggest things that really helps me recover.
It would be easy to give up, but if I've learned anything, it's that this cause is too important. It affects too many people for me to walk away. So I'm starting a new campaign called ‘Creating Consent Culture.' I've been instagramming about it already, because the solution to gender based violence and rape culture is creating a culture of consent where we actually treat each other like human beings, where we actually ask each other how we're feeling, and we ask before we touch or kiss, or go further. My goal is to make it mainstream by the end of 2016. The more we collaborate, the more we cooperate and the more we lift each other up, the further we'll get.
Opening up about rape or sexual assault isn't as scary as you think. By telling my mum about my first experience of sexual assault, I learned that she had experienced it too. That's the thing – there are so many more survivors out there than you would imagine, and chances are, the person you're telling may have a similar story or might know someone else who has one. One of my exes even contacted me to tell me that they were assaulted when they were younger, and they didn't even tell me when we were dating.
That's why speaking up is one of the best ways to fight back. No man out there wants the reputation of being a rapist. And when we start telling each other about what has happened to us – be it face-to-face, over the phone or on social media – it creates a sense of shame. But this time, it's placed on those who are actually at fault. And that's the way it should be.'

It was only a few minutes ago but sometimes these things happen so fast it's hard to remember all the details…. I've been sick for the past 2 days and today was my first day out. I went back to my old hostel to leave a note for a friend, Nick. There was another guy there, Shakir, who was desperately trying to get with me. I kissed him once but he seemed drunk so I told him it was bad timing, I had already met someone. Before heading out, I went upstairs to say hi to one more friend, Clyde from the states. Shakir followed me upstairs and said he was going to take a shower. He invited me to join. I said yes because the water at my current hostel is pretty cold and after 2 days of being sick, I just really wanted a hot shower. As soon as I got in the bathroom, he forced me to my knees. I said “stop!” but he just got more violent. He lifted me up and put his penis in my vagina. I asked him to stop, again, as I began to cry. When he shoved it in my ass, that's when I passed out. I woke up a few minutes later and saw him trying to creep out the door. When he saw that I was awake, he came back to finish me off in the shower. I have all those fucked up feelings that we get after rape…shame, disgust, suffering. I'm here, alone, and any DNA has been wiped away in the shower. The South African police will just roll their eyes when I walk in. Feeling sicker than ever now. Needless today, I'm going to disappear for a bit. Just need to enjoy the freaking sun and call my friends and family in the states. Love you guys. Thank you for always being there for me. All the more reason to continue @stoprapeeducate but not today. Today, I need rest. #StopRapeEducate
These are the Angel Cards I drew last night. ? Headed to the hospital now. Keep praying for me, everyone. Dealing with cops is tough and the rape kit is the last thing I want– tools and metal instruments and combs all up in my private parts…. But this is what I stand for. I tell you guys to speak up every single day and I know that I need to practice what I preach. It is so incredibly hard, tho, but having you all here for me makes all the difference. I know that this may not go anywhere and I know that I may face ridicule by the police but I will take a shot at “justice” anyway. What I tell the survivors who reach out to me is that justice, true justice, can only come from within. Justice is inner peace. I'm still getting there but whether he serves time or not, I know what I need to do to heal. Today is just Day 1. Thanks to my amazing new friend @hyomie for coming with me to the hospital. And many thanks to the dozens of messages I've received. You all are so amazing. I'll try and respond to each one as soon as I can. ⭐️ #StopRapeEducate
My view of the rape kit. Thank you all for being so loving & supportive during this time. Your messages pushed me to take action and to stand up for myself and for all rape survivors. For those who wish to BLAME ME or any other survivor out there, I want you to know that you are the very reason that I am so brutally honest. I could have hidden details. I could have kept some info to myself, but NO. You need to know the truth and to see the reality of the situation. No matter what a person does, it is not an invitation for rape. It doesn't matter if I kissed him. It doesn't matter if he was drunk. It doesn't matter if I said yes to a shower. I never said he could get violent with me. I never said he could make me bleed. I never said he could rape me. But still, that's how the scene went down. I don't need to explain myself but if you're wondering WHY I took a shower with him, it was written in the text, I'd been sick with food poisoning for 2 days and needed to sweat it out. My current place of residence has only cold water (third world problems are real!) and it seemed like a miracle to be offered a hot shower. That's not what he was there for though, because as soon as he got a chance, he threw me to the ground and had his way. Dealing with rape is hard enough but the aftermath is often even more traumatic but I did this for you and I did this for me. The US Embassy and the South African police are super supportive and he may be arrested as soon as this week. Thank you for the love. And for the victim blamers, I send love, peace, and enlightenment to you so that you may be a beacon of light for us, too.
A 28-year-old who was born male but now is legally female has filed a $75,000 lawsuit against U-Haul, saying an employee looked at her with contempt before refusing to rent a moving van to her.
Annah Kaye Smith had a reservation for a van at the U-Haul location at 704 N.E. Hogan Road in Gresham but was told when she arrived to pick it up that no vans were available, according to her lawsuit.
She was hastily ushered out the door by a U-Haul employee on Jan. 15, 2015, says the suit filed last week in Multnomah County Circuit Court.
Smith then spotted three parked vans -- just like the one she had reserved, the suit says. But by then, the employee told her that her reservation had been transferred to a Troutdale U-Haul and she'd have to go there to rent.
"It was a look of disgust," Smith told The Oregonian/Oregonlive on Thursday. "I sensed from his demeanor that he did not like what I was wearing or the way I looked. ... He was friendly to other customers."
Smith said the Troutdale location was closed when she arrived and she left empty-handed, forced to postpone plans to move a couch she was buying off of Craigslist. Smith's spouse rented a van elsewhere the following day.
"I wouldn't want that to happen to anyone again," Smith said. "All I really wanted was an apology from them, and I didn't get that, even in mediation. ... It just never came."
U-Haul media and public relations manager Jeff Lockridge declined comment Friday for this story, saying U-Haul doesn't talk about pending litigation.
But the company denied discrimination played any part in Smith's experience in a response to a complaint Smith filed last year with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries.
In November, bureau investigator Andrea Damewood recommended that Smith's complaint be dismissed as unsupported by substantial evidence.
"Firstly, (Smith) was not ultimately denied service; rather, she and her partner were able to obtain a van the next day," Damewood wrote.
Damewood also wrote that Smith didn't claim that the U-Haul employee said anything discriminatory to her. The investigator found that the case became too difficult to prove because Smith didn't provide a photograph of the parked vans or any other witnesses who saw available parked vans on the Gresham U-Haul lot that day.
At the same time, Damewood said U-Haul acknowledged that it did indeed have a van available at the Gresham site that day and that it had been reserved for Smith. The report doesn't explain why U-Haul failed to rent the van to Smith, but chalks up Smith's experience to "poor customer service."
Smith's Portland attorney, Beth Creighton, said she has a recording later that day of a customer service agent telling Smith and her spouse that there were actually three available vans at the Gresham location that day.
Creighton disagrees with the Bureau of Labor & Industries dismissal. It's not necessary for an employee to make an overt statement to discriminate, she said. The lawsuit states that U-Haul violated ORS 659a.403, which bars discrimination in a place of "public accommodation" based on "race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status or age if the individual is 18 years of age or older."
Smith said the experience has left her shaken. She feels anxious now going into stores and businesses.
"I'm like, 'Is this going to happen to me again?'" Smith said. "What do I do if this happens again?"
She worries about being out alone at night because she's aware of hate crimes against transgender people, she said. That was on her mind when -- under the direction of the Gresham U-Haul employee, she says -- she drove up to the Troutdale U-Haul, and saw it closed.
"It just freaked me out when I was pulling into that darkened, dimmed place," Smith said.
Thoughts raced through her mind, she said: "Why did you send me here? Does he have some friends or something?"

Demonstrators seize on president's use of word ‘lazy' as rallying slogan for protests in Paris and other big cities
Demonstrators and trade unionists have taken part in mass street protests across France against Emmanuel Macron's overhaul of labour laws – the first strike action to face the new president.
The leftwing CGT union, France's second biggest, called 4,000 strikes and protests on Tuesday, with public sector workers, train staff and energy sector workers joining. Transport was disrupted in Nice, but in Paris delays were limited to two commuter lines. The Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair cancelled flights, but other airlines, high-speed trains and Eurostar trains ran as normal.
On the edge of the Paris street protest, police fired teargas after a large group of masked men dressed in black briefly threw projectiles.
The day of protest was the first test of whether opposition to Macron's pro-business plans to loosen labour rules, which would make it easier for companies to hire and fire, could bring demonstrators on to the streets. The new president was determined to face down any opposition.
The word “lazy” swiftly became the rallying slogan of anti-Macron demonstrators at Tuesday's street protest in Paris as well as rallies in cities such as Nice, Marseille, St-Nazaire and Caen, where some shouted: “Lazy slackers unite.”
The turnout – which was lower than last year's demonstrations against the Socialist president François Hollande's labour law changes – will serve as a yardstick for trade unions' ability to mobilise against Macron. Deep splits have emerged in the labour movement between those determined to fight the reforms and those prepared to compromise. Crucially, other top unions in France did not take part in the protests, which comforted the government.
Macron, a 39-year-old former investment banker and centrist who was elected in May against the far-right Marine Le Pen, is seeking to style himself as a pro-business reformer who would never give in to street protests. His labour law changes are being fast-tracked through parliament by executive orders.
A row broke out this weekend over Macron's strong language after he said in a speech in Athens that he would “not yield anything, either to the lazy, the cynics or the extremes”.

“Exhausted, angry … but not lazy,” read a placard carried by Valérie, 50, a health assistant from outside Paris. “I'm not against reforms per se, but we don't want protections stripped away so people are forced into precarious, low-wage jobs like they are in Britain or Germany. My grandparents and great-grandparents fought to have social security, to get rights which are now being stripped away. This is about protecting the French social model.”
The leftist MP Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who will lead a separate demonstration on 23 September, joined a protest in the southern port city of Marseille where he said France did not want unbridled economic liberalism. “France isn't Britain,” he added.
Pauline Forest, 25, a master's student at university in Versailles, demonstrating in Paris with her students' union, said: “These old free-market approaches, which haven't changed since Margaret Thatcher, don't work any more and people don't want it.”
André Delattre, a retired secondary school teacher, carried a sign warning that “the lazy” were taking to the streets. “Tidy up labour law by all means but not by giving all the advantages to the boss class. Macron is not listening now, but his big fear is young people taking to the streets, and he would listen then,” Delattre said.
Macron – who is keen to avoid street protests spreading to other proposed, contentious changes including to the pensions system, unemployment benefits and training schemes – said last month that the French people “hated reforms”, but that he was proposing a “transformation” to fire up the country's economy and make it a leader in Europe. In Athens last week, he lamented that France “is not open to reforms … We rebel, we resist, we circumvent. This is what we are like.”

Macron is facing street demonstrations sooner after taking office than any other recent French leader. This is in part because his labour law changes are being pushed through parliament with record speed using executive orders. The new laws include a cap on payouts for unfair dismissals and greater freedom for employers to hire and fire. The new labour rules will affect all private sector workers in France, but not public sector workers. But state workers made up the largest number of CGT union demonstrators on Tuesday, who warned that the government was also planning “crushing” public sector cuts.
The prime minister, Edouard Philippe, insisted the street protests would not result in any changes to the new laws. He said the new labour laws had been spelled out to voters before the presidential and parliament elections as the solution to France's mass-unemployment problem. Joblessness, currently at 9.5%, is about twice that of Britain or Germany.
So far, the Élysée seems confident it can face down protests, in part because opposition is fragmented. Macron's new political grouping, La République En Marche, controls parliament. The next biggest party on the right is bitterly divided. Although some other trade unions were critical of the labour law changes – despite a consultation period – no other leaders of big unions joined the CGT street demonstrations on Tuesday. Crucially, the CFDT, which is now France's biggest union, did not officially take part, even if a handful of its members joined the Paris protest.
Opinion polls show voters do not like the labour reforms overall but back many of its individual measures, including direct negotiations between bosses and their staff in small firms.
Over the summer, Macron's popularity slipped, with recent polls showing that only around 40% of French voters are satisfied with his performance in office. Analysts attribute the disaffection to a mix of communication problems and political missteps in which his initial measures on tax and reforms were seen as muddled and unfair, benefiting the rich more than the poor.
× Pasadena Police Officer Charged With Insurance Fraud After ‘Ice Bucket Challenge' Video
A Pasadena police officer has been charged with insurance fraud after appearing in an “Ice Bucket Challenge” video while out of work on a disability claim for a lower back injury, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office announced Monday.
Jaime Robinson, 39, pleaded not guilty on Friday to four counts of insurance fraud. Her bail was set at $40,000, the DA's office said.
She was accused of exaggerating injuries on two occasions to collect disability benefits, according to Deputy District Attorney Arunas Sodonis of the DA's Healthcare Fraud Division.
In July, Robinson allegedly appeared in a video posted online in which she was shown picking up and pouring a 5-gallon bucket of ice water over a fellow officer as part of the ALS “Ice Bucket Challenge” that swept the nation last summer. She was out of work on a disability claim for a lower back injury at the time, the DA's office said.
Five gallons of water weigh about 42 pounds.
Robinson was also accused of fraudulently receiving disability pay for more than year related to a shoulder injury, a spokesman for the DA's office said. That alleged crime occurred in 2012.
Two counts of insurance fraud were filed in connection with each instance, according to a criminal complaint.
Total losses were estimated at $117,000, the DA's office stated.
Robinson faces up to six years, four months in state prison, time that would be served in county jail, the DA's office stated.
She was expected to return to court in downtown Los Angeles on June 10.

Google is extending its Street View imagery service into the Philippines today. The Internet giant announced that it will begin capturing images of capital city Manila, but will expand coverage to the rest of the country, which is composed of a prolific 7,107 islands, in due course.
Like its Street View projects in other Asian countries, Google has partnered with the Department of Tourism in the Philippines. Governments in the West have often fretted over the privacy implications of Street View, but Asia has been more progressive in that respect — many countries see the service as having the potential to boost tourism.
Google has kicked things off in the Philippines' by publishing images of Intramuros, an historic old section of Manila that was given the Street View treatment recently. You can check out The San Agustin Church, Baluarte de San Diego, Plaza San Luis Complex and Fort Santiago on Google Maps, the video below gives an overview.

24 hours ago the Philadelphia Flyers played a game they would most likely want to never think about again. Today, the Flyers made some changes from their lineup in Boston. Shayne Gostisbehere made his return to the lineup after being a healthy scratch yesterday afternoon. Brandon Manning found himself watching the game from above as he was the scratch of the day. Steve Mason also returned between the pipes after backing up Michal Neuvirth in Boston
None of this would matter, though, as Washington would beat the Flyers by a score of 5-0.
Today's game in Washington is the Flyers sixth game in the last nine days, and also is their last before entering the NHL mandated bye week.
Shots came early and often for the Flyers, however they could not find the back of the net. At the end of the first period, the Flyers had almost tripled the Capitals in shots, leading there 13-5. Shayne Gostisbehere played very well and led the team in ice time in the period. The Flyers had a couple of power plays during the period but did not convert, despite generating some solid chances with the advantage.
At around the nine-minute mark of the second period Michael Del Zotto had an absolutely laughable attempt at clearing a puck. Instead of clearing it, he gave turned it over to Andre Burakovsky directly in front of the net! He would score. It was laughable. But hey, it was only one goal? They can come back from that. This team has looked solid so far, no worries.
The second period came to a close. The Capitals lead 1-0, both teams were tied in shots during the period. This is anybody's game ... right?
WELL OH BOY LEMME TELL YOU ABOUT THE THIRD PERIOD. Please, strap in your seat belt for this fun, fun, fun adventure. It will take around five minutes.
Because that — five minutes — is how long it took Washington to score four goals.
FOUR
GOALS.
IN FIVE
MINUTES.
More enjoyment could be had watching 40 minutes of Mites On Ice, or even watching cats and dogs attempt to play Jai alai. It would be more fun to sit there and rewinding VHS tapes for eight hours. Maybe while we're at it, why not just pour a pot of boiling water all over your face. This period does not even deserve to be recapped, there are no words to be said. The Flyers have left us speechless. So, fan who may or may not have fire shooting out of their ears reading this. We leave you with this.
Before you go, we've constructed a playlist of only the finest music to listen to after a Flyers game. Please leave any recommendations in the comments below.
Jon Entine argues:
Razib at the Unz Review responds:
Actually, I think Jon is wrong on this. Better drugs and biological engineering mean that I suspect at some point in the near future the fastest “human” alive is going to be non-African, and, if I had to bet, Chinese. But you know what Jon meant.
Khan goes on to argue:
One peculiar thing population genetics teaches us that non-adaptive traits are more heritable. This is due to the fact that selection tends to remove variation, selecting for fitter individuals. Humans are good runners, there are entire evolutionary theories based around our biomechanical modifications and adaptations. But there's really no benefit in running in bursts of 10.5 in the 100 meter dash vs. 9.5. We're not that sort of ambush predator. There's probably some heritable variation in burst ability, but it's small, and not visible in any normal set of tasks among large groups of humans. But modern competitive sports at the Olympic level is not selecting for normality, it's selecting from outliers. It isn't that West Africans were guaranteed to be the best sprinters, it's just that a priori it shouldn't be surprising that in such a non-adaptively beneficial trait as running a few seconds faster in the 100 meter dash some populations had the genetic die loaded in their direction.
I wouldn't be surprised if the ability to outrun those who are after you and mean to do you harm were an important life skill that is highly adaptive in Darwinian terms.
For example, in 1982, when I had just moved to Chicago, I was headed into the Century Mall on N. Clark St., when a black teen rushed out, followed by two twenty-something Hispanic security guards in close pursuit. I watched them head up Clark Street with the teen in sneakers pulling away from the guards in shiny black leather shoes.
But whether sprinting ability or distance running ability is best for survival depends upon how long pursuers' sightlines extend in your home terrain.
The shoplifter then turned left at the first corner. It occurred to me that was an important life decision he had just made: if it was a dead end he was in big trouble. But if it were a thru street then he just needed to make a series of seemingly random turns until he had lost his pursuers.
In contrast, if the pursued had headed into open grassland, his pursuers could keep him in sight for a long time, so his better sprinting ability might prove nugatory if they had more endurance.
Perhaps in forested or brush covered terrain, as in West Africa, sprinting is selected for because the pursued individual can get lost faster, while in open grassland, as in East Africa, endurance running is the surest way to get away.
What do kids like more than giant robots punching other giant robots? Well, what about giant cat robots forming together to create a giant robot with kitty hands to punch other robots in the face?
Voltron Legendary Defender has all that and more to appeal to children and adults, new and old fans alike.
As stated in an interview with Lance's voice actor, Jeremy Shada, the writers of Voltron Legendary Defender wanted to create a series that was both faithful to the original but at the same time have a modern take to entice new viewers. And boy, did they succeed.
It's clear from the get-go that the creators love this show. Everything from the cinematography, to the revamped soundtrack, to the characters themselves bring life and a dimension to the Voltron universe.
This show is a near perfect balance of kid-friendly content, witty and well-written dialogue, and it's respectful to sensitive issues like PTSD, genocide, racism, grief, and sacrifice.
Normally, a kids show would not reference heavy topics like racism and genocide, the writers address these issues in order to help younger audiences learn and gain exposure to difficult subject matter.
Each of the personalities of the paladins of Team Voltron complement one another, and unlike in many other sentai series, one paladin does not overshadow another. A true ensemble series.
While it would be nice to see more episodes entirely devoted to characters like Pidge and Lance, the deeper Team Voltron plunges into the war against the Galra Empire, the more likely it is that each of the cast will face obstacles that will allow their characters to be fleshed out in more detail.
For example, Keith and Shiro have the most time dedicated to their character arcs. Fans speculated from season 1 regarding Keith's Galra heritage and Shiro's possible death later in the series.
Other theories fans have been throwing around are about Prince Lotor, who the previous Paladins (with the exception of Zarkon and King Alfor) were, the mystery Galra in the Weblum's belly, and more.
A couple of questions I would like to have answered are regarding Matt Holt and Galaxy Garrison.
Matt Holt: Dead or Alive?
The fate of Pidge's brother, Matt Holt, is still unconfirmed as it was revealed in season 2 that, “he was taken by a group of rebels” (Pidge, season 2 episode 10). At this point, it's not likely the aforementioned resistance group is the Blade of Marmora since subterfuge and guerrilla attacks seem to be more their style. Plus, a detail like saving the family member of one of the Voltron Paladins kind of seems like a minor detail that should have come up in conversation.
So, the question is: where is Matt Holt? (and Papa Holt?)

Galaxy Garrison: Friend or Foe?
One question that has not received much attention is from the very first episode of season 1. The characters themselves even comment on how, when Shiro crash lands on Earth, the Garrison officers who intercept him treat him as a threat despite knowing who he is as evidenced by when one of the officers refers to Shiro by name.
The answer that remains to be seen is if Galaxy Garrison is already aware of the Galra threat, as judging by Lance, Hunk, and Pidge's reactions to when Shiro was captured, this is not normal protocol.
Regardless of whether the viewers receive answers to these questions or not remains to be seen. Despite that, considering the speculation surrounding the events of the end of season 2, season 3 is shaping up to be possibly even more exciting than anticipated.

—Notes on media invention—
—Notes on interviewees who try to appear normal on television and who are bizarre to the nth degree. These interviewees are so bizarre, in part, because they ARE trying to appear normal—
I wrote this Sandy Hook article in 2013. It's about the soap opera called television. I've added some new comments:
Online investigations of what really happened at Sandy Hook easily number in the thousands by now. Among other reporters, I have listed and described many contradictions and lies in the official scenario, and I've offered alternative explanations.
People have concluded:
No one was really killed in Sandy Hook, it was all faked;
The killings were real, but Adam Lanza wasn't the shooter, he was the patsy;
Lanza was the killer, compelled by psychiatric drugs.
A Satanic group was behind the killings;
Players in the federal government secretly contracted the killings in order to take guns away…
No matter what the conclusion, many of the investigations and analyses have turned up startling and useful information.
On YouTube, clips of Sandy Hook citizens being interviewed reveal astonishing reactions and non-reactions that are light years away from what you would expect to see in the immediate wake of such a tragedy.
You can look for YouTube interview clips featuring “the people of Sandy Hook”: Robbie Parker, the Sotos family, Sally Cox, H Wayne Carver, Gene Rosen, Kaitlin Roig, etc.
Their reactions, non-reactions, strange behavior, inexplicable attitudes are stunning.
First of all, you have to realize that only certain people get on television. That's fact #1, and it's a major key. Only certain people are interviewed.
Television is the filter through which we see.
Parents who are completely grief-stricken, who have fallen apart and are incoherent (which is what you would expect): not interviewed.
Parents who are very angry and outraged: not interviewed.
Parents who demand answers from a full investigation, who aren't satisfied with the emerging media-controlled story line: not interviewed.
Then we have parents who refuse to be engaged by any media person, who feel any media contact is insane and invasive and massively insensitive: obviously not approached for an interview.
We don't see these people, because they aren't on television. So making some vast generalization about all of the Sandy Hook community is sketchy at best.
Then, on top of that, television news people are creating a story line about what happened at the school and in the town, and they are finding people who will corroborate that plot line, or can be convinced by news producers to corroborate it. This further narrows the field of acceptable interviews.
We have interviewees who have never been on television before, but have watched thousands of television interviews. They have a strong tendency to “act like people are supposed to act” when they are put on camera.
They speak like television, they act like television, they think like television, they admire what television admires. They learn how to behave from television. They learn what is appropriate from television.
In this sense, television is the Stepford Village enabler. It invades a town during a tragedy, it sets up, it rolls out a story line that is independent from reality, and it cues selected people to be the robots who confirm that story line, no matter how grotesque the distortion.
“I know you've just lost your daughter, and I can't imagine how you feel at this moment, but you see, when we interview you, we want to honor her life. This is your chance to let people all over the world know what and who she was. Her spirit, her interests, her hobbies, what her friends felt about her. You can show the world how alive she was and how happy she was, and you can remember that and you can even smile…”
And the mother of that daughter hesitates, pauses, thinks about what she really feels, and then decides the television producer is right and she'll go along with it. On camera, she tries to act normal. She tries to fulfill her television role. And she comes across as a twisted android.
Some of the Sandy Hook interviewees appear to be machine-made cartoons. Something leaps out of them when they appear on television. They laugh, they smile, they act casual, they act “efficient” and stone-faced, they act placid and calm, they act polite, they act as if they've been cast for a stage play that has nothing to do with Sandy Hook.
They act as if they have no resource or experience that allows them to contact what they actually are. As if a wall has been built between what they are and how they are behaving.
In my opinion, this is a lot worse than if they had been (badly) trained at an actor's school to intentionally provide material for an all-out hoax.
It's a lot worse, because the manufactured front is their only reference point. As such, it takes only minimal direction to move them to any chosen square on the media-controlled checkerboard.
“How do I need to behave to fit myself into the situation as an acceptable person?” This is the guiding question they ask themselves. The answer plugs in immediately. It is always going to be wrong, because every situation is, to some degree, alive, and their answer dictates dead behavior. Machine behavior.
We need to understand that these extraordinary and stunning and bizarre interviews from Sandy Hook are mirrored in other places. For example, what are we to say about thousands of soldiers who are duped into a war that had no sane reason to exist in the first place?
But there the soldiers are, on the battlefield. They are living and breathing and mouthing sentiments that have absolutely nothing to do with the situation in which they have been placed.
The war is promoted as necessary. It is heralded as an opportunity to do service, to protect freedom, but those are gross lies.
Is a typical soldier in such a war going to look any less strange than one of those parents interviewed at Sandy Hook?
Two of the most egregious Sandy Hook interviews, with Robbie Parker, father of a six-year-old girl who was just reported killed in the school, and with H Wayne Carver, the Connecticut medical examiner, are mind-boggling.
First of all, you can confirm that Parker is a real person with a real background by searching Utah newspapers; e.g., The Deseret News. Parker is seen, in his now-famous Sandy Hook interview, smiling broadly and chuckling and having a good time just prior to stepping in front of the microphone to make a public statement, at which point he huffs and puffs and tries to get into the character of a grieving father.
It's hideous.
Carver, in response to press questions, not only gives absurd and completely inappropriate answers, he guffaws once or twice, as if he's out of control.
In Carver's case, I would say he's covering up some gigantic medical lies about the case. He's trying to dissemble and, underneath his shaky exterior, he's very nervous and scared that something is going to jump out of the hopper. He doesn't know what to do. At moments, it looks as if he's going to come apart at the seams.
If by some miracle, we had been able to see long uncensored interviews with many, many citizens of Sandy Hook; if we could have seen and heard, unvarnished, everything the people of Sandy Hook were experiencing; what would we think? What would we know? (And since the events in Sandy Hook, why haven't we seen 20 or 30 long open interviews with parents of the schoolchildren? Who put a lid on that?)
Whatever the truth is about what happened and didn't happen in that town, whatever the true operation that was mounted and carried out there—the role of television is central.
It is the prime programmer.
Television is the calculated average on display for the average viewer. It is the hyper-normal maniac.
The people who own and run television for the masses are bringers of an emotional wasteland.
Why are they successful?
They plug into a deep cynicism that underlies the robotic behavior and thought of millions of people.
This inner cynicism comes about because people already feel cut off from their own wide emotional range.
Television magnifies and exacerbates that disconnectedness.
Some high priest, some dictator, generalissimo, president, elite news anchor, some numbers cruncher who sees this modern world as a playground in which to forward market research, looks for the golden average, the emotional sweet spot on which gobbling maggots can prey.
I have no ax to grind here. The people who honestly conclude that Sandy Hook was one great hoax from the beginning and no one died; the people who conclude that Lanza was the patsy for professionals who did the killing at Sandy Hook Elementary School; the people who believe Lanza was the killer driven over the edge by psychiatric drugs: the people who believe the Sandy Hook killings were a secret-society operation or a black-ops horror designed to grab the guns of Americans; all these people will continue to explore their paths and they will unearth important information.
What I'm offering here is a perspective on how much of what we see is delivered to us through the twisted lens of television.
The great goal of media and its controllers is reduction, so populations will accept whatever seems “more efficient,” more ordered, more systematic, more organized, more automatic, more predictable, more repetitive.
Television could, if it chose to, make Sandy Hook look and feel like Columbine or the McMartin School…
Feeling, thought, data, facts—television can rearrange these to fit its purposes.
It can emphasize the grief, or the police actions, or the horror, or the need for new laws…in any proportions it chooses.
It also could, if it chose to (but never would) highlight the outrage of local citizens who are demanding a deeper investigation by law-enforcement; at which point, the whole course of the story would change.
Keep in mind that, at Sandy Hook or any other major news event, the field reporters and anchors on the scene are NEVER digging up the story. They're working off of statements from the police or the FBI. There is no reason for media to be there, aside from ratings. They could be assembling the storyline back in the studio.
“Yes, folks, we have our reporters out there in Sandy Hook, but they're not actually doing anything, they're just telling you what the cops are saying. But we want to give you the impression that you're there, too, so you plug into the horror and the grief. We want to give you the impression that we're discovering, on our own, new facts every few minutes. Suspense, mystery.”
The media learned a few lessons from Sandy Hook. Among them: don't put a medical examiner on camera until he's been vetted, until it's clear he'll present a bland summary of findings; don't release footage of interviewees (e.g., Robbie Parker) before they make their official statement.
Consider an analogy to sports. The players on the field are the main attraction and focus. The referees, who make important decisions, stay in the background. But in media, the roles are reversed. The anchors and reporters (referees) are in the foreground. The witnesses, victims, and perpetrators (the players) are kept in the background. Why? Because media are the story. Media take over. They position themselves front and center. They believe they own the news. They don't piece together the story from witnesses. They unroll the story based on law-enforcement statements. The witnesses are merely used for flavor. This, of course, is absurd.
But it's par for the course for media.
“We own the news. We make the news. We report the news. We invent the news. We are the news.”
If the media are the news, then we need reporters who will report on the media.
And now, online, we have just that, exactly that.
And it's taking apart and destroying the news as it was, as it has been for a long time.
The best film ever made about television's war on the population is Paddy Chayefsky's scorching masterpiece, Network (1976).
Network bursts forth with lines like these, from newsman Howard Beale, at the end of his rope, on-camera, speaking to his in-studio audience and millions of people in their homes:
“So, you listen to me. Listen to me! Television is not the truth. Television's a god-damned amusement park. Television is a circus, a carnival, a traveling troupe of acrobats, storytellers, dancers, singers, jugglers, sideshow freaks, lion tamers, and football players. We're in the boredom-killing business… We deal in illusions, man. None of it is true! But you people sit there day after day, night after night, all ages, colors, creeds. We're all you know. You're beginning to believe the illusions we're spinning here. You're beginning to think that the tube is reality and that your own lives are unreal. You do whatever the tube tells you. You dress like the tube, you eat like the tube, you raise your children like the tube. You even think like the tube. This is mass madness. You maniacs. In God's name, you people are the real thing. We are the illusion.”
The media, as I say, not only believe they make the news and own the news; they believe they are the news. They are trapped in that “model.” They can't get out.
Now, in 2017, as they rail against fake news, they're basically exclaiming, “The news couldn't exist without us, because we embody and encircle what news IS.”
This rises to the level of insane metaphysics. The tree falling in the forest doesn't make a sound unless CNN is there to film it and broadcast the audio.
And if CNN decides the falling tree is singing Deutschland, Deutschland über alles on the way down, and rigs the audio to make it so, then that's what's happening.
This is an Empire that's supposed to last forever?
The pillars are crumbling, and we don't need CNN to hear it.

Barry, a prominent figure during the civil rights movement, said that he "agonized" over whether to oppose the bill but that he decided to stand with the "ministers who stand on the moral compass of God."
"I am representing my constituents," said Barry, who later told reporters that "98 percent of my constituents are black, and we don't have but a handful of openly gay residents."
Civic activist Philip Pannell, who is openly gay and lives in Ward 8, called Barry's remarks offensive. "He of all people, coming out of the civil rights movement, should understand the need to fight for the rights of all minorities to be protected," Pannell said.
Catania and Jim Graham (D-Ward 1) are the two openly gay members of the council, and Catania made it clear that he took offense at Barry's stance.
"This issue is whether or not our colleagues, on a personal level, view me and Jim Graham as your equals," Catania said, "if we are permitted the same rights and responsibilities and obligations as our colleagues. So this is personal. This is acknowledging our families as much as we acknowledge yours."
Barry, visibly upset, fired back that he has been a supporter of gay rights since the 1970s.
"I understand this is personal to you and Mr. Graham. I understand because I have been discriminated against," Barry said. ". . . I resent Mr. Catania saying either you are a bigot or against bigotry, as though this particular legislation represents all of that."
Catania replied: "Your position is bigoted. I don't think you are."
The tenor of the debate was equally heated outside the council chamber.
"We need a new council. They are destroying our youth," a same-sex marriage opponent, Paul Trantham of Southeast Washington, shouted in the hallway during the ruckus. "Every minister who fears God should be here. This is disrespectful to the nation's capital. There is nothing equal about same-sex marriage."
This week, more than 100 black ministers signed a letter to Fenty opposing the measure.
Council member Yvette M. Alexander (D-Ward 7) accused some of the black ministers of questioning her religious commitment and threatening to unseat council members who supported the bill. "The ministers have really upset me to a point they have questioned my Christianity, they have questioned my morality," Alexander said.
The Archdiocese of Washington issued a statement criticizing yesterday's vote as showing "a lack of understanding of the true meaning of marriage."
Outside the Wilson Building, Steven Gorman of Crestwood in Northwest Washington stood quietly holding a "marriage equality" sign. "I've been out for 25 years, and I've been battling for 25 years," said Gorman, who married his partner last summer in California. "This is not over, but we are winning."

Everybody loves beating on Ringo Starr -- he's got a weird face, they say, and isn't he the one who wrote that song about the submarine? Don't forget too that apocryphal tale of someone asking John Lennon if Ringo was the best drummer in the world, to which he allegedly replied, "He isn't even the best drummer in the Beatles."
There's also the very real quote from longtime manager producer George Martin:
''[Lennon] was the soul of the Beatles, Harrison was the spirit,'' he said. ''Paul was the heart, and Ringo was the drummer.''
Continue Reading
Well, there won't be any Ringo-bashing here, no sir. The 71-year-old former Beatle is still touring, and he's coming to Hard Rock Live tonight at 8. As a primer -- and a lesson for anyone who might think of Ringo as the Meg Griffin of Liverpool -- here are seven pieces of evidence from A Hard Day's Night, the Beatles' 1964 feature film, that show why Richard Starkey is definitely the most badass Beatle.
1. He came up with the name of the movie.
No-brainer here. "A hard day's night" was one of many "Ringoisms" -- things he'd say that made just enough sense to, you know, write songs about and stuff. (For anyone interested: The movie title came first -- the song was after that.)
2. He's the dealer.
Bored on the train ride to their television appearance, the boys want to play some cards. Ringo takes charge when no one else will, giving 'em the old Liverpool shuffle and winning -- even though that rat Lennon is cheating:
3. While the other Beatles goof off, Ringo's smoking cigs and pondering life.
The characters in A Hard Day's Night behave in relatively predictable ways -- John harasses everyone and makes dumb jokes (see: "Coke snorting," above), the managers are permanently exasperated, Paul is doing his "smile and be adorable" thing, Paul's grandfather is being mind-bogglingly creepy, and George is stumbling around muttering things.
Ringo, however, is always the one off to the side, having a smoke or reading a crime novel. He doesn't need the nonsense -- he's a thinking man.
4. He rejects a cougar.
The other Beatles spend the whole film mugging for the ladies -- waving, winking, grabbing, following them about. Ringo doesn't mess around with that silliness. But on the train, a wealthy woman takes notice of the young drummer. Ringo, his head firmly on his shoulders, turns her down.
"She'll only reject me in the end, and I'll be frustrated," he tells George. "I know the psychological pattern. It plays havoc with me drum skins."
He also seems to woo a female reporter at one point -- she asks him if he's a "mod or a rocker," and he responds with the most punk thing a Beatle ever said: "No, I'm a mocker."
5. He's the one who gets invited to the high-end gambling hall.
As the rest of the Beatles rag on Ringo for not getting any fan mail, one of the managers comes in with an overflowing armload for him -- including an invitation to the post Le Cercle gambling hall.
The above photo isn't from A Hard Day's Night, though -- it's from Dr. No, where Le Cercle is the destination of choice of another badass Britisher: James Bond.
6. He ditches the backstage shenanigans for an adventure.
While George is messing around with some weird modeling agency and John and Paul poke at a troupe of dancers, Ringo sneaks out to have a walk around town -- he tosses bricks in the river, plays darts in a café, and spends a few minutes thinking about things in general:
He doesn't care about the antics. He's a musician, and he needs a little time to himself every once in a while. Of course, the time he spends brooding in the streets eventually leads him to...
7. He stirs up enough trouble to get himself arrested.
The fuzz don't take kindly to disguised ruffians harassing street vendors and chucking stuff into the canals -- but that doesn't bother Ringo, who responds to his charges by breaking out of jail and playing the drums on television. When was the last time Neil Peart did that?
In conclusion, yes, Ringo is a popular target. But just because he's not one of the fabled Lennon/McCartney songwriters doesn't mean he's the lame Beatle -- and there's at least one film that proves it.

In an article for his diocesan newspaper, Bishop Thomas J. Olmsted of Phoenix has said that Pope Francis's recent document on the family, Amoris Laetitia, does not permit giving Communion to divorced and civilly remarried believers.
“As a good shepherd, Pope Francis focuses special attention on those who walk on the edge of despair because of personal failures and problems they have suffered in their families, and because of the complex and contradictory situations in which they find themselves now,” Olmsted wrote in the Sept. 18 article.
“This does not, however, include receiving Holy Communion for those who are divorced and remarried,” he wrote.
“Pope Francis specifically calls those in this situation ‘to seek the grace of conversion',” Olmsted continued. “Throughout Amoris Laetitia we see a continuity with the Church's magisterium, especially that of Blessed Paul VI, St. John Paul II, and Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, which reaffirm the constant tradition of the Church.”
Olmsted then quotes paragraph 84 of John Paul II's 1981 document Familiaris Consortio, in which the Polish pope stated that divorced and civilly remarried Catholics “are unable to be admitted [to Communion] from the fact that their state and condition of life objectively contradict that union of love between Christ and the Church which is signified and affected by the Eucharist.”
“This situation does not, it is important to note, mean that [these] persons are excommunicated from the Church,” Olmsted said.
“They should be encouraged to pray, attend Mass, and rectify the situation in communication with their pastor, who remains their pastor despite the case of objective sin,” he said. “Accompaniment is possible and should be the case in our parishes.”
Olmsted said that in his document, Pope Francis puts both sacred scripture and Church teaching at the center of his reflection.
“Throughout the entire exhortation, and indeed throughout all of his papacy, the Holy Father has gone to great lengths to show that God's Plan for marriage and family is truly good news, and that it is possible, with God's grace, to know His plan, to accept it in faith and to live it with joy and ever deepening love,” the Phoenix bishop wrote.
Since Amoris Laetitia appeared in April, bishops and groups of bishops in various parts of the world have interpreted its provisions on Communion for the divorced and remarried in differing, and, at times, contradictory ways.
Archbishop Charles Chaput of Philadelphia in July issued a set of guidelines for his archdiocese largely drawing the same conclusion as Olmsted, and the bishops of Alberta and the North West Territories in Canada recently put out their own guidelines saying the view that the pope's document has opened the door to Communion after a conversation with a priest is “erroneous.”
On the other hand, bishops of the Buenos Aires region in the pontiff's native Argentina recently issued a draft set of guidelines appearing to suggest that it is possible to readmit divorced and civilly remarried Catholics to Communion under some circumstances.
That draft drew a positive response from Francis, who wrote to the bishops to say that “there are no further interpretations” and that “I am confident it will do much good.”
To date, the Vatican has not issued additional clarification concerning the meaning and implementation of the pope's document.
Just weeks ahead of the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are neck-and-neck, polls released Sunday reveal.
In New Hampshire, Sanders is backed by 50 percent—a four point lead over Clinton, who has 46 percent, according to surveys from NBC/The Wall Street Journal/Marist.
In Iowa, Clinton has 48 percent, compared to 45 percent for Sanders.
In both states, the gap between Sanders and Clinton fell within the poll's margin of error. Conducted between January 2 and 7 among 422 likely Democratic caucus-goers, the Iowa survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.8 percent. The New Hampshire survey of 425 probable Democratic primary voters had the same margin of error.
"Turning to the general election," the poll summary notes, "when Clinton and Sanders are each matched against, Trump, Cruz, or Rubio, Sanders does better than Clinton among registered voters in both Iowa and New Hampshire."
Sanders leads in electability by a wide margin: an average of 6 points in Iowa and 21 in New Hampshire.

Sanders' lead is, in part, due to the democratic socialist's strong performance among independent voters.
The latest numbers were broadly interpreted as a good sign for the senator from Vermont, with The New York Times running the headline on Sunday: "Bernie Sanders Makes Strong Showing in New Polls."
The findings come amid growing momentum, including recent reporting from Politico that, in the Nevada caucuses slated for February 20, the state is "suddenly looking like it's in play" for Sanders, "opening another unexpected early state front."
What's more, Sunday's poll findings follow earlier surveys which showed that, when matched against GOP front-runners, Sanders is more electable than Clinton.
In an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News that aired Sunday, Sanders said: "Any objective look at our campaigns would suggest we have the energy, we can drive a large voter turnout."
Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterization (chemical, structural, and thermal) of a new crystal phase of lithium hydrazinidoborane (LiN 2 H 4 BH 3 , LiHB), which is a new material for solid-state chemical hydrogen storage. We put in evidence that lithium hydrazinidoborane is a polymorphic material, with a stable low-temperature phase and a metastable high-temperature phase. The former is called β-LiHB and the latter α-LiHB. Results from DSC and XRD showed that the transition phase occurs at around 90 °C. On this basis, the crystal structure of the novel β-LiHB phase was solved. The potential of this material for solid-state chemical hydrogen storage was verified by TGA, DSC, and isothermal dehydrogenations. Upon the formation of the α-LiHB phase, the borane dehydrogenates. At 150 °C, it is able to generate 10 wt % of pure H 2 while a solid residue consisting of polymers with linear and cyclic units forms. Reaction mechanisms and formation of bis(lithium hydrazide) of diborane [(LiN 2 H 3 ) 2 BH 2 ]+[BH 4 ]− as a reaction intermediate are tentatively proposed to highlight the decomposition of β-LiHB in our conditions.
You may wonder why I call my stay at Vritomartis Naturist Resort an experience. Well, simply because it was an experience, and a good one. Anything that has to do with Crete has been a good experience for me so far, so I am probably biased. 😉
What makes Crete and Vritomartis so special? First: the people. I love the Greek people. Cretans know how to make you feel welcome. You're not a walking wallet (a mistake that Spain has made), but you're a guest, a friend. The atmosphere in and around Vritomartis is wonderful and relaxed. If I could spend my future days in Crete I would be a happy nudist writer. Vritomartis is special to me because I didn't do very much there. I didn't go out on any of the many (also naturist) excursions they offer. I was there to relax and unwind, and that worked out perfectly.
This may give you an idea why.
Another little something that made my stay at this resort special was that I finished writing Naked Crow 2 there, and it gave me the initial inspiration to write Naked Crow 3 – Nagual. Of course, lazing around near the pool and writing wasn't all I did. Even during times of relaxation I sometimes feel the need to go out and do something. I took a few walks to the nude beach that's connected to the resort, Filaki Beach. If you want to have a nice time at the water with the convenience of a small bar at hand, go to Filaki Beach. You won't regret it.
If you want to have some fun around the resort, that too can be arranged. Aqua gym for instance. Low impact, fun and good for you. My favourite however was the archery part:
Imagine great weather, enthusiastic people, a coach who has fun helping everyone learn shooting with bows and arrows, and being naked. How can life be better?
Vritomartis hasn't seen the last of me yet. And next time I intend to go on a few of the excursions. I've read comments on them and they are definitely worth the while!
Polite, eternally self-effacing and, at the age of 42, still letting his eyes retreat behind a diffident fringe, Jonny Greenwood is not a man given to extravagances. He is quietly proud, for instance, to drive an 18-year-old car. As a member of Radiohead, the Oxfordshire five-piece that redefined contemporary rock and, latterly, the mechanisms of the music industry, he is regularly voted among the best guitarists in the world, yet he hates the reverence given to the instrument: he owns just three (one of them a touring back up). It is refreshing, then, and more than a little revealing, when he finally owns up to an indulgence.
“I've flippantly said in the past, but I meant it, that instead of spending so much money on your hi-fi, you should really go and hire a string quartet,” he says, folding himself into a sofa in his management company's office in Oxford. “It will be the most affecting thing you could possibly do in your house. I've done it once, just as a present for someone, and it was embarrassing for the first 20 minutes because it was only the two of us watching. But it was more memorable than any holiday. Wouldn't you rather do that, once in a year, when most people spend far more money on technology to play their music?”
In the company of orchestras
Over the last year or so, Greenwood has been spending more time in the company of orchestras, composing for ephemeral performance and it has made him reconsider his relationship to studio music. “I love the impermanence of the music live,” he wrote recently. “It's played in the room – which is itself infinitely variable from one concert to another – and then it's gone, soaked into the walls.”
His most recent composition, Water, is a case in point. It will receive its world premiere in Dublin next week, presented by the Australian Chamber Orchestra in a programme that includes Mozart, Haydyn and Tchaikovsky, and there are no plans to record it. Rock musicians rarely cross over to classical composition with as much grace – consider the fates of Paul McCartney and Elvis Costello – and very few ever find themselves in the company of marble busts.
“I like to feel, in my fraudulent way, that I'm joining the orchestra for as long as I'm with them,” Greenwood says of his former residency with the ACO. “I'm kind of bluffing and dissembling wildly. But at the same time, wanting to feel like they're not just a collection of presets on a keyboard. It's not just first violin and second violin, it's a whole bunch of people with their own ideas and that's what makes it so interesting, I think. How they play and how it sounds is always going to be different from one rehearsal to the next. It's like trying to catch a liquid.”
Water has been composed for strings, flutes, piano, organ and tambura – an Indian drone instrument that Greenwood discovered during his year off from Radiohead.
“Have you heard one?” he asks, never more animated than when describing a new musical discovery, and quickly retrieves a sample from his iPhone. “It's that sound. It constantly shifts. It never quite repeats itself, and it's just kind of obsessed me. This piece, Water, is orchestral, but the orchestra is meant to come out of the tambura instead of the other way around. It's sort of meant to be a solo for this instrument that doesn't change note or pitch. It's a little perverse, I know.”
Restless experimentation
This seems typical of Greenwood's restless experimentation. In Radiohead, his evolving interests have made him a wide-ranging multi-instrumentalist: keyboards, percussion, glockenspiel, analogue synths, software programming, an array of tech. “I'm a good bluffer,” he says. “Most instruments I can convincingly play for a few minutes. Any longer than that and people would find me out. It's like being an impressionist in a way.” He is, however, one of the world's few adept players of the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument that Greenwood discovered via the 20th century French composer Olivier Messiaen, and which he has made an idiosyncratic component of Radiohead's expansive sound.
In his orchestral work, Greenwood has channelled the spirit of Messiaen, Bartók and the Polish avant garde composer Krzysztof Penderecki, most notably on Popcorn Superhet Receiver. A darkly meditative piece, written 10 years ago when he was the BBC Concert Orchestra's composer-in-residence, that composition formed the basis for his film score, There Will Be Blood, for director Paul Thomas Anderson, and has led to several more. In one appreciation of Greenwood's composing, the New Yorker's Alex Ross invoked his classical training, and a music degree thwarted by his band commitments, to argue that Greenwood was best understood as “a composer who has crossed over into rock”.
Greenwood is better able to reconcile his parallel careers, which is just as well, because they are about to make him extremely busy. A new score for Anderson's forthcoming Thomas Pynchon adaptation, Inherent Vice, will emerge later this year. “Such a funny film,” he smiles, “yet there's some strange emotion in it, neither anger nor sadness, which I couldn't really pinpoint. It was a really peculiar tone.”
He has also been collaborating with the London Sinfonietta chamber orchestra and premiering genre-melding pieces in gig-like recitals with the London Contemporary Orchestra.
Radiohead reconvene
And now, after their longest ever break and a profusion of solo projects, Radiohead have reconvened this month to begin recording their ninth album.
“I think I was always going to be in a band,” Greenwood reasons, scooping back his hair. “When I was tiny – six or seven or eight – I would be obsessed with the idea of being in a band. It's only as Radiohead got more successful, and we got the budget to play around with orchestral string groups and write arrangements for Radiohead songs and then do the occasional soundtrack, that it made me remember how I spent my teenage years, which was in the company of recorder groups and string groups.”
Now, he says, whenever he sees someone carrying around a cello, he considers it far more admirable than another wannabe toting an electric guitar. “When someone is playing in an orchestra and devoting all their time to playing and practising and learning, it's sort of amazing.”
Of his role in Radiohead, Greenwood says: “It's like being an arranger. How do you put this song across without being retro, and without being offputtingly, wilfully obtuse, but still put the song across really well? A lot of these songs work when Thom [Yorke] just sits and plays them on the piano. It's tempting to leave it alone sometimes, but it feels like it could go elsewhere, so it usually does.”
Greenwood is uncertain if he could attend the world premiere of Water, which he has not yet heard fully realised (“Until then it's just ink”). It seems unusual for someone who seems happiest when participating, lending guitar or manning the Martenot for his own compositions. “It's the best place to be, in the middle,” he says contentedly, “to sit amongst the musicians and hear it like that.” It sounds like a purely musical indulgence, as intimate as a private string quartet recital or a composition that exists only for the fleeting moment: in Greenwood's philosophy, you have to be there.
“That's how it feels,” he says. “It's just how to get people there, and to decide where ‘there' is.”
Water, by Jonny Greenwood, receives its world premiere at the National Concert Hall, Dublin on October 2nd as part of the Australian Chamber Orchestra's European Tour
The sheer size of our universe is just about unfathomable, so you can imagine the surprise that researchers must have experienced when they recently discovered a structure within our universe that measured 5 billion light years across. That's more than one-ninth the size of the entire observable universe, and by far the largest structure ever discovered.
In fact, this mysterious structure is so colossal that it could shatter our current understanding of the cosmos.
“If we are right, this structure contradicts the current models of the universe,” said Lajos Balazs, lead author on the paper, in a press release by the Royal Astronomical Society. “It was a huge surprise to find something this big – and we still don't quite understand how it came to exist at all.”
Just what is this massive structure? It's not a single, physical object, but rather a cluster of nine massive galaxies bound together gravitationally, much like how our Milky Way is part of a cluster of galaxies. It was discovered after researchers identified a ring of nine gamma ray bursts (GRBs) that appeared to be at very similar distances from us, each around 7 billion light years away.
GRBs are the brightest electromagnetic events known to occur in the universe, caused by a supernova. Their detection typically indicates the presence of a galaxy, so all of the GRBs in this ring are believed to each come from a different galaxy. But their close proximity to one another suggests that these galaxies must be linked together. There is only a 1 in 20,000 probability of the GRBs being in this distribution by chance.
A mega-cluster of this size shouldn't be possible, at least not if you think in terms of our current theories. Those theories predict that the universe ought to be relatively uniform on the largest scales, meaning that the sizes of structures shouldn't vary by much. In fact, the theoretical limit to structure size has been calculated at around 1.2 billion light years across.
If the Hungarian-American team's calculations are correct, then this giant new structure-- which measures in at over 5 billion light years across — would blow that classic model out of the water. In fact, either the researchers' calculations are wrong on this, or scientists will need to radically revise their theories on the evolution of the cosmos.
Needless to say, this GRB cluster discovery has the potential to cause a sweeping paradigm shift in astronomy. At the very least, it reminds us just how small our view of the universe really is.

A Republican state lawmaker in Texas is sending a message to her Muslim constituents: if they want to come calling at her Capitol office, they better pledge allegiance to the United States.
Newly-minted state Rep. Molly White (R) wrote Thursday in a Facebook post that she'd left an Israeli flag on the reception desk in her Austin office to mark the occasion of Texas Muslim Capitol Day. She said she also instructed her staff to “ask representatives from the Muslim community to renounce Islamic terrorist groups and publicly announce allegiance to America and our laws.”
“We will see how long they stay in my office,” White wrote.
Texas Muslim Capitol Day is organized by the Texas chapters of the Council on American-Islam Relations. The event encourages participants to lobby lawmakers on legislation including a bill that would prohibit courts from interpreting religious law.
White responded to criticism of her Texas Muslim Capitol Day plan in the comments on her Facebook post.
“I do not apologize for my comments above,” she wrote in one comment. “If you love America, obey our laws and condemn Islamic terrorism then I embrace you as a fellow American. If not, then I do not.”
“Isn't it amazing when you stand for America, our allies and against terrorism how much vile and angry responses you get?” she wrote in another comment. “I will never cow to anti Americanism and extremists.”

Participants in CAIR's event were also reportedly met by protesters outside the Capitol building who held signs reading “Go home and take Obama with you” and “Radical Islam is the new Nazi.”

White issued a statement Thursday afternoon that welcomed “all of our constituents” to her office, but did not apologize for the comments on her Facebook page:
“I welcome all of my constituents who would like to come and visit our office in the Texas State Capitol. As law abiding American citizens, we all have the privilege and the right to freedom of speech granted to us by the First amendment, and believe fully in the democracy that our nation is founded upon. As a proud Texan and American I fully denounce all terrorist groups or organizations who's intent is to hurt and destroy the great state of Texas and our Nation.”

But you, when you pray, go into your closet, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly (Matt. 6:6).
You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven (Matt. 5:14-16).
Blessed is he who is not offended because of Me. (Matt. 11:6)
There is an invisible side of the Christian faith, known only to God and the believer. St. Matthew's gospel refers to this as the secret place. It is not only intended to be secret, but exists only in secret. If we refuse to protect the secret then we will find its door closed to us as well.
Our faith also has a very public aspect and cannot normatively be practiced solely in secret. I say, “normatively,” recognizing that circumstances of persecution make the public confession of the faith difficult. However, as the lives of the martyrs attest, even under persecution, the Christian life maintains a public aspect – unto death if need be. Our modern culture frequently asks us to hold these matters in reverse. We speak of secret things and hide those which should be public.
In the liturgical discipline of the early Church, the mysteries (today often called “sacraments”), were indeed mysteries: they were not open to public view. The catechumens, those who were preparing to be baptized, were dismissed from the service to attend other prayers and instruction, while the faithful, alone, remained for the celebration of the mysteries. In Orthodox liturgies, the dismissal of the catechumens remains, at least in word. The mysteries of Baptism and Eucharist are now open for public attendance, though the mystery of the Eucharist may only be received by the faithful.
In our larger culture, many things that should remain “secret” are open for public knowledge and scrutiny. The most sordid details of private lives are openly discussed before audiences on our screens. Magazine covers of relatively innocuous magazines promise “how-to's” of great sex. I need to say nothing about environs of the internet.
Secret matters of the religious life are often treated in a very public manner. St. Paul only obliquely refers to a man who was “caught up to the third level of heaven.” Most scholars agree that he is referring to himself – but such speech would have been deemed inappropriate. His oblique reference skates up to the very edge of acceptability.
Today, Christians often boast about their innermost experiences – we would seem to be a civilization of mystics. It is very difficult to find a balance in our lives.
The secularity of our culture constructs a false world-view for us, creating confusion within the spiritual life. Secularity presumes that there is such a thing as “neutral” territory. The world exists as a vast, neutral ground, inherently objective with no loyalties one way or another. People who subscribe to various versions of secularism see religion as an import, something which does not naturally belong to the order of things. It is not that secularism sees the world as “atheistic”: the world is simply nothing one way or another.
The “natural” spirituality of secularism is indifference. If you want to think about God, that is your business. If I don't want to think about God, that is my business. But nothing in the world should make me or anyone else inherently thinks about God. The world and all of its stuff – is indifferent. The expression of the world is thus found in its neutrality. All expressions that deny this neutrality are disruptive. T-shirts and crosses, “Tebows” in the end zone, a creche in the public square – all are disruptive of the neutrality of the secular order.
Those who have been born to this order, those who are the children of the modern world, find that their inner lives are as “naturally” neutral as the world around them appears to be. Reading about the lives of saints creates a longing, a homesickness for a land that is as foreign as any fantasy. Do people actually see angels? Can bread truly be more than bread? Do waters part? Do voices speak from fiery clouds? Even the quiet efforts of prayer and the best intentions within the liturgy can be experienced with an emptiness that mocks our attempts at piety. No convert from ancient paganism ever suffered the numbing lassitude of neutrality's temptations.
The “neutrality” of nature has moved beyond perception in contemporary society – it has now become a positive value. Thus, the disruptions of religious actions are seen as distractions and disturbances to the way things “ought” to be. They are unnatural and unwelcome. A reader of the blog relates public rebukes (in Greece!) for simply saying, “Thank God.” Of course, I am certain that oaths and curses invoking God receive no such rebuke! Here in the Bible belt of America, a friend relates being publicly attacked for offering the traditional English “God bless you!” when someone sneezed. A recent letter to the editor in my local Tennessee newspaper requested that letters mentioning religion be removed to somewhere other than the editorial page, since the newspaper is “secular.” Little wonder that wearing a cross is increasingly forbidden in the work place.
The enforced “neutrality” of secularism asks Christians to become invisible. Christians are the new pariahs. Invisibility is not a difficult request for modern Christians. Our religion is often enough invisible to us as well. Some will even argue that this is as it should be – Christianity belongs in the closet (Matt. 6:6).
Man is not meant to live a closeted life. If we are the light of the world, then the light will burn a hole in our secularized baskets and burn the closet down! But this is to describe what should be rather than what is. Modern experience teaches us that baskets and closets simply snuff the light. We go into our closets and pretend to be the light of the world.
The context of Christianity in the modern world differs significantly from the context of first-century Palestine. Our context is the fantasy world of secularism. Our struggle is not against the false public piety of the Pharisees but against the false humility of invisible Christianity. Religion should be understood as a set of practices. Religion or spirituality as a set of ideas is a fiction of secular thought: “keep your religion in the closet of your head.” How we eat, how we speak, how we marry, how we die, how we mourn, how we order our time, how we dress, how we manage our money – all of these and similar “folkways” rightly involve practices that are identifiably religious. For the modern invisible Christian – folkways are largely indistinguishable from those of the surrounding culture.
To live as the light of the world is to be a transforming presence. We do not transform the world by coercion – we transform the world by our Christian existence. Much of our culture, even in its secular form, owes its shape to the transforming presence of Christians. That the world today has a concept of human rights is the direct result of Christian Trinitarian thought and its understanding of personhood.
However, the offspring of Christendom have learned to reject its history and to imagine itself to be self-invented. Christians cannot agree to this myth and pretend that we have not lived within the world for 2,000 years. We are locked in a struggle.
The primary weapons of that struggle remain the inner life of prayer and the purification of the heart. We will not be the light of the world if our hearts are filled with darkness. Christians do well to be confident and hopeful within their daily lives – for “greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world.” Despair and anger are the tools of darkness and have nothing to do with light.
By the same token, Christians should not be fearful of the growing aggression of radical secularism. We should not abandon Christian folkways (where they exist). The return to traditional Christianity (as opposed to secularized market-based Christianity) should include embracing a transformed life expressed in public as well as private. If we are the light of the world, we need not fear the darkness.
I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God (Romans 12:1-2).

3D-printer torture tests being all the rage, I decided to test overhanging features (35° angle from the horizontal) in combination with a tightly turning (35 mm diameter) torus on top.
A simple instruction to how I made it is included.
I think my Zortrax M200 did well, but there is a ripple effect visible on the underside that I don't know the cause of, and the bridging of the curve was (of course) impossible... ;)
Edit: the first STL file was incorrectly positioned, uploaded a new file with the Z axis pointing UP... Both files are otherwise identical!
Edit2: Added two closeups of the wavy undersides, one from the Helical Horror, and another from a lattice cube with the same dimensions, but with straight lines instead of curves! The waves are less pronounced in the lattice cube, but they are still there. X-Y resolution issues? Resonance?
Edit3: Added a final photo, printed the object at 0.09mm layer height, and resized to 200%. The wavy pattern is almost invisible, and the only flaw is the beginnings of a slight drip beneath the overhanging parts, but that is easily removed with some sandpaper.
This article is about the internet slang initalism. For other uses, see LOL (disambiguation)
LOL, or lol, is an initialism for laugh(ing) out loud[1][2][3] and a popular element of Internet slang. It was first used almost exclusively on Usenet, but has since become widespread in other forms of computer-mediated communication and even face-to-face communication. It is one of many initialisms for expressing bodily reactions, in particular laughter, as text, including initialisms for more emphatic expressions of laughter such as LMAO[4] ("laugh(ing) my ass off") and ROFL[5][6][7] (or its older form ROTFL;[8][9] "roll(ing) on the floor laughing"). Other unrelated expansions include the now mostly obsolete "lots of luck" or "lots of love" used in letter-writing.[10]
The list of acronyms "grows by the month",[6] and they are collected along with emoticons and smileys into folk dictionaries that are circulated informally amongst users of Usenet, IRC, and other forms of (textual) computer-mediated communication.[11] These initialisms are controversial, and several authors[12][13][14][15] recommend against their use, either in general or in specific contexts such as business communications.
The Oxford English Dictionary first listed LOL in March, 2011.[16]
Analysis
Laccetti (professor of humanities at Stevens Institute of Technology) and Molski, in their essay entitled The Lost Art of Writing, are critical of the terms, predicting reduced chances of employment for students who use such slang, stating that, "Unfortunately for these students, their bosses will not be 'lol' when they read a report that lacks proper punctuation and grammar, has numerous misspellings, various made-up words, and silly acronyms."[12][13] Fondiller and Nerone in their style manual assert that "professional or business communication should never be careless or poorly constructed" whether one is writing an electronic mail message or an article for publication, and warn against the use of smileys and abbreviations, stating that they are "no more than e-mail slang and have no place in business communication".[14]
Linguist John McWhorter stated, "Lol is being used in a particular way. It's a marker of empathy. It's a marker of accommodation. We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles…" Pragmatic particles are the words and phrases utilized to alleviate the awkward areas in casual conversation, such as oh in "Oh, I don't know" and uh when someone is thinking of something to say. McWhorter stated that lol is utilized less than a reaction to something that is hilarious, but rather as a way to lighten the conversation.[17]
Yunker and Barry in a study of online courses and how they can be improved through podcasting have found that these slang terms, and emoticons as well, are "often misunderstood" by students and are "difficult to decipher" unless their meanings are explained in advance. They single out the example of "ROFL" as not obviously being the abbreviation of "rolling on the floor laughing" (emphasis added).[15] Haig singles out LOL as one of the three most popular initialisms in Internet slang, alongside BFN[dubious – discuss] ("bye for now") and IMHO ("in my honest/humble opinion"). He describes the various initialisms of Internet slang as convenient, but warns that "as ever more obscure acronyms emerge they can also be rather confusing".[1] Bidgoli likewise states that these initialisms "save keystrokes for the sender but [...] might make comprehension of the message more difficult for the receiver" and that "[s]lang may hold different meanings and lead to misunderstandings especially in international settings"; he advises that they be used "only when you are sure that the other person knows the meaning".[18]
Shortis observes that ROFL is a means of "annotating text with stage directions".[7] Hershock, in discussing these terms in the context of performative utterances, points out the difference between telling someone that one is laughing out loud and actually laughing out loud: "The latter response is a straightforward action. The former is a self-reflexive representation of an action: I not only do something but also show you that I am doing it. Or indeed, I may not actually laugh out loud but may use the locution 'LOL' to communicate my appreciation of your attempt at humor."[6]
David Crystal notes that use of LOL is not necessarily genuine, just as the use of smiley faces or grins is not necessarily genuine, posing the rhetorical question "How many people are actually 'laughing out loud' when they send LOL?".[19] Franzini concurs, stating that there is as yet no research that has determined the percentage of people who are actually laughing out loud when they write LOL.[2]
Victoria Clarke, in her analysis of telnet talkers, states that capitalization is important when people write LOL, and that "a user who types LOL may well be laughing louder than one who types lol", and opines that "these standard expressions of laughter are losing force through overuse".[20] Egan describes LOL, ROFL, and other initialisms as helpful so long as they are not overused. He recommends against their use in business correspondence because the recipient may not be aware of their meanings, and because in general neither they nor emoticons are in his view appropriate in such correspondence.[3] June Hines Moore shares that view.[21] So, too, does Lindsell-Roberts, who gives the same advice of not using them in business correspondence, "or you won't be LOL".[22]
Acceptance
On March 24, 2011, LOL, along with other acronyms, was formally recognized in an update of the Oxford English Dictionary.[16][23] In their research, it was determined that the earliest recorded use of LOL as an initialism was for "little old lady" in the 1960s.[24] They also discovered that the oldest written record of the use of LOL in the contemporary meaning of "Laughing Out Loud" was from a message typed by Wayne Pearson in the 1980s, from the archives of Usenet.[25]
Gabriella Coleman references "lulz" extensively in her anthropological studies of Anonymous.[26][27]
A 2003 study of college students by Naomi Baron found that the use of these initialisms in computer-mediated communication (CMC), specifically in instant messaging, was actually lower than she had expected. The students "used few abbreviations, acronyms, and emoticons". Out of 2,185 transmissions, there were 90 initialisms in total;[28] 76 were occurrences of LOL.[29]
LOL, ROFL, and other initialisms have crossed from computer-mediated communication to face-to-face communication. David Crystal—likening the introduction of LOL, ROFL, and others into spoken language in magnitude to the revolution of Johannes Gutenberg's invention of movable type in the 15th century—states that this is "a brand-new variety of language evolving", invented by young people within five years, that "extend[s] the range of the language, the expressiveness [and] the richness of the language".[30][28] However Geoffrey K. Pullum argues that even if interjections such as LOL and ROFL were to become very common in spoken English, their "total effect on language" would be "utterly trivial".[31]

Commonly used equivalents in other languages
In some languages with a non-Latin script, the abbreviation LOL itself is also often transliterated. See for example Arabic لول and Russian лол.[citation needed]
Pre-dating the Internet and phone texting by a century, the way to express laughter in morse code is "hi hi". The sound of this in morse ('di-di-di-dit di-dit, di-di-di-dit di-dit') is thought to represent chuckling.[40][41]
Most of these variants are usually found in lowercase.
The word "lol" in other languages
In Dutch, lol is a word (not an acronym) which, coincidentally, means "fun" ("lollig" means "funny")
In Welsh, lol means "nonsense" or "ridiculous" – e.g., if a person wanted to say "utter nonsense" in Welsh, they would say "lol wirion" or "rwtsh lol"[51]

A recent article in FAIR reviewed the findings of its latest study on the quality of political “debate” being aired on the mainstream networks. It studied the run-up to the military interventions in both Iraq and Syria. Perhaps the arbiters of the study intended to illustrate what we've learned since the fraudulent Iraq War of 2003. Well, it appears we've learned nothing.
FAIR spent hours painfully absorbing the misinformation peddled by such soporific Sunday shows as CNN's State of the Union, CBS's Face the Nation, NBC's Meet the Press, and ABC's This Week, plus some of the more popular weekly political programming including ADHD-inducing CNN's Situation Room, Fox News Channel's Special Report, the venerable sedative PBS NewsHour, and MSNBC's Hardball. You know the cast of characters: glib George Stephanopoulos, forthright Candy Crowly, harrowing Wolf Blitzer, and stentorian Chris Matthews. Images of their barking maws are seared into the national hippocampus.
Overall, 205 mostly government mouthpieces were invited to air their cleverly crafted talking points for public edification. Of them, a staggering sum of three voiced opposition to military action in Syria and Iraq. A mere 125 stated their support for aggressive action.
Confining its data to the Sunday shows, 89 guests were handsomely paid to educate our benighted couch-potato populace. One suggested not going to war. It stands to reason that considered legal arguments against these interventions got the short shrift, too.
The media consensus on Syria and Iraq isn't an isolated instance of groupthink. Far from it. It conforms to a consistent pattern, one that has at its core a deliberate disregard for international law and efforts to strengthen transnational treaties and norms regarding military action. (Although transnational law regulating trade is highly favored, for obvious reasons.)
Here the New York Times uncritically repeats Israel casualty figures from the recent attack on Gaza. The journalist, Jodi Rudoren, gives equal legitimacy to sparsely defended claims from Tel Aviv and “painstakingly compiled research by the United Nations, and independent Palestinian human rights organizations in Gaza.” She adopts a baseless Israeli definition of “combatant”, ignoring broad international consensus that contradicts it. She dubiously conflates minors with adults, and under-reports the number of children killed. And so on. All in the service of the pro-Israel position of the paper.
In 2010 Israel assaulted an aid flotilla trying to relieve Palestinians under the Gaza blockade. Author and political analyst Anthony DiMaggio conducted Lexis Nexus searches that demonstrate how U.S. media and the NYT in particular scrupulously avoid the topic of international law when discussing Israeli actions. In one analysis of Times and Washington Post articles on Israel between May 31st and June 2nd, just five out of 48 articles referenced international law relating to either the flotilla raid or the blockade. DiMaggio dissects several of the methods by which Israel flaunts the United Nations Charter. He adds that Israel has violated more than 90 Security Council resolutions relating to its occupation. You don't get this story in the American mainstream. But this is typical. U.S. media reflexively privileges the Israeli narrative over Arab points of view, and barely acknowledges the existence of dozens of United Nations resolutions condemning criminal actions by Israel.
It's the same with Iran. For years now, Washington has been theatrically warning the world that Iran wants to build a bomb and menace the Middle East with it. That would be suicidal. It is common knowledge among American intelligence agencies, and any others that have been paying attention, that Iran's foreign policy is deterrence. But this doesn't stop the MSM from portraying Tehran as a hornet's nest of frothing Islamists.
Kevin Young has done a telling survey of articles on nuclear negotiations between the U.S. and Iran. Some 40 editorials written by the Times and the Post were vetted. Precisely zero editorials acknowledged international legal implications of U.S. public threats and various subversions led by Israel, such as assassinating scientists and conducting cyber-attacks, both innovations on standard violations of sovereignty. However, 34 of the pieces “said or implied” that Iran was seeking a nuclear weapon. Forget that 16 American intelligence agencies stated that Iran had no active nuclear weapons program. These papers of record prefer to trade in innuendo and hearsay, despite assessments to the contrary. More than 80% of the articles supported the crippling U.S. sanctions that are justified by the supposed merit of the bomb-building claim.
Prior to Young's work, Edward Hermann and David Peterson looked at 276 articles on Iran's nuclear program between 2003 and 2009. The number itself is staggering, more so when stacked against the number of articles written over the same period about Israel's nuclear program: a mighty three.
This is interesting considering the posture of both countries in relation to international treaties. Israel freely stockpiles nuclear weapons and maintains a “policy of deliberate ambiguity” about its nuclear weapons capacities, despite frequent efforts by Arab states to persuade it to declare its arsenal (which is estimated by some to be in the hundreds). Also, it has yet to sign the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) that has been signed by 190 nations worldwide. This intransigent stance has marooned the broadly embraced idea of working to establish a nuclear weapons free zone in the region.
Contrast Israel's behavior with that of Iran itself, which has permitted extensive inspections of its nuclear facilities. The Times recently noted the country's main nuclear facilities were “crawling with inspectors.” Iran is also a party to the NPT and is a full member of the IAEA. It continues to try to work toward a reasonable solution with the West despite debilitating sanctions levied on it by the United States. America has unduly pressured the IAEA to adopt additional protocols that would require prohibitively stringent demands on Iran, rendering the possibility of a negotiated solution comfortably remote from an American standpoint. (These additional demands reportedly include drone surveillance, tracking the origin and destination of every centrifuge produced anywhere in the country, and searches of the presidential palace. All of these passes without comment from our deeply objective journalist class.)
Coverage of Iraq is no different, particularly in advance of periodic illegal war of aggression against it. Former U.N. Special Rapporteur on Palestine Richard Falk and author Howard Friel conducted a survey in 2004 assessing the New York Times' pre-war coverage of Iraq in 2003. In more than 70 articles on Iraq, the Times never mentioned “UN Charter” or “international law.” The study also found “No space was accorded to the broad array of international law and world-order arguments opposing the war.” But such arguments only exist outside of Western corridors of power in Washington, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv.
This isn't debate. Real debate is pre-empted by internal bi-partisan consensus on some basic issues: maintain a giant garrison state, shrink the state everywhere else, preference corporations over populations, restrict civil liberties to secure status quo power structures. So when it comes to Iran, Iraq, Syria and the like, the question isn't whether to go to war, but what kind of war to fight. Hawks want bombs. Doves want sanctions. Publicans want Marines. Dems want a proxy army of jihadis. They both want Academi mercenaries. (Obama hired out the gang formerly known as Blackwater to the CIA for a cool $250 million.) And when we've finished off ISIS, the question won't be about an exit strategy, but whether to head west to Damascus or east to Tehran.
The question isn't whether to cut aid to Israel given its serial criminality in Gaza and the West Bank, but how fast settlements can annex the Jordan Valley without attracting more international opprobrium. (International law, again, set aside.)
On the domestic front, the question isn't whether to have single payer or private healthcare, but whether citizens should be forced to purchase private schemes or simply admonished to do so. The question isn't whether or not to keep or strengthen New Deal entitlements, but how swiftly they can be eviscerated. The question isn't whether or not to surveil the body politic, but where to store the data, and whether or not to harvest two-hop or three-hop metadata. The question isn't whether or not to hold authors of torture programs accountable, but how much of the damning torture report to redact so as to leave them unprosecutable. The question isn't whether or not to regulate Wall Street but, as slimy oil industry lawyer Bennett Holiday put it in Syriana, to create “the illusion of due diligence.”
All this is not to say the MSM isn't aware of alternative viewpoints. It is, but it only acknowledges them when they can be used to justify a foregone conclusion. In the past year, the MSM has nearly become infatuated with international law. Friel has tracked the paper of record's response to the Ukrainian fiasco. What did he find? When Russia annexed Crimea, the Times inveighed against the bloodless “invasion” as a gross violation of international law. Eight different editorials over the next few months hyperventilated about global security, castigating Russian President Vladimir Putin for his “illegal” violation and his “contempt for,” “flouting,” “blatant transgression,” and “breach” of international law. Calls were sounded to “protect” against such cynical disregard of global consensus. Western allies needed to busy themselves “reasserting international law” and exacting heavy penalties on Russia for “riding roughshod” over such sacred precepts as “Ukrainian sovereignty.”
Quite so, as Washington supports the toppling of democratically elected governments in Kiev and Tegucigalpa, sends drones to ride “roughshod” over Yemeni, Pakistani, Somali and other poorly defended borders; and deploys thousands of troops, advisors, and American-armed jihadis to patrol the sectarian abattoirs of Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. But better to exonerate ourselves on those counts and chalk it up to the fog of war. After all, we follow the law of exceptionalism, clearly defined by Richard Falk as, “Accountability for the weak and vulnerable, discretion for the strong and mighty.”

You may have heard that the Force will be awakening on December 18. To provide an outlet for our excitement, we've assembled another Vulture Advent Calendar — in this case, 25-Star Wars–themed stories, one per day until Christmas. None of them will involve midi-chlorians.
The Star Wars franchise isn't known for its melancholy. But if you focus on the only speaking character to appear in all seven of the space-opera flicks, it becomes a lot more neurotic. C-3PO is surrounded by adventurers and warriors, but he's just a self-doubting nebbish, always worried and never satisfied. In other words, he's much like a Woody Allen protagonist. For this week's Vulture Remix, in honor of Anthony Daniels's return to the Threepio suit in The Force Awakens, we've assembled this mash-up of the famed opening credits and monologue from Allen's Manhattan and the golden droid's own gripes and contemplations. Wring your metal hands along with him.
Once you're done, watch our other Vulture Remixes, which come out on Mondays. There's one where Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice comes out in 1949, and here's one where Miss Piggy lip-syncs Rihanna! Woody Allen would probably hate the latter, but he might dig the former.
T-Mobile told the FCC this week that it should be able to complete the post-broadcast incentive auction repack in the 39 months the FCC has allotted and under—though not much—the $1.75 billion caps on repack relocation expenses.
T-Mobile plans to bid in the auction, so it is looking to get access to that spectrum as soon as possible after the auction. Wireless companies as a group have, understandably, urged the FCC to keep to the 39-month timetable for the spectrum handoff to winning wireless spectrum bidders.
The National Association of Broadcasters has used a study by Digital Tech Consulting (DTC) to argue that the 39-month timetable may need to be pushed and the $1.75 billion likely won't be enough. It says the FCC should not set a hard deadline before it knows how many stations will need to be moved, which won't be known until after the reverse auction.
Submitting its own study to the FCC this week, T-Mobile begged to differ, saying the NAB report was flawed "because it overstated demand and understated supply."
T-Mobile said its study was conducted in partnership with Jack Boone of Broadcast Tower Technologies, Inc. (BTTi) and William Hammett and Rajat Mathur of Hammett & Edison (H&E), and was based on "detailed station records for every television license in the country," as well as FCC auction simulations, "phone interviews with broadcast construction industry professionals, research of publicly available sources and BTTi's and H&E's decades experience and expertise in broadcast engineering..."
The telco said the collective conclusion they came to was that the supply of "transition resources"—tower crews, equipment—was sufficient to meet the demands of "every broadcast television station in the United States that will need equipment and services to relocate following the incentive auction."
T-Mobile outlined seven reasons it has concluded to repack of TV stations after the forward auction can be done on time and at, or under, budget.
1. "Not All Stations Will Need New Antennas. Broadcasters will not need new antennas in many circumstances because they often share antennas, and some antennas can be used on multiple channels.
2. "Not All Towers Will Require Modifications. Using the FCC's conservative 2014 repacking simulations, we found that, on average, only 845 unique antenna structures will be involved in the repacking process. This estimate is lower than DTC's finding because it takes into account the number of antennas that will not need to be replaced.
3. "Television Antenna Supply Will Be Sufficient. Contrary to DTC's assertions, more than two manufacturers are capable of providing and, in fact, do provide antennas to broadcast stations.
4. "Ample Radiofrequency ('RF') Consulting Engineers Are Available. We have identified 18 additional RF consulting engineers than DTC included in its analysis. An accurate tally of RF consulting engineers demonstrates sufficient capacity to assist with between 370 and 475 construction permit applications per month.
5. "More Than Enough Tower Structural Engineers Are Available to Meet Anticipated Demand. We have identified 19 structural engineering firms capable of conducting work on tall towers, which we define as towers more than 1,000 feet tall (305 meters).
6. "At Least 41 Tower Crews Are Available Today to Work on Tall Towers. We identified 41 tower crews [DTC had said 16] operating today that are capable of working on 1,000 feet tall towers. Even if one were to accept DTC's assumption that one crew can complete only eight or nine antennae change projects per year and its assumption that these projects could not begin until six months into the repacking process, today's workforce could complete at least 900 station relocations during the remaining 33 months of the transition.
7. "The Repacking Process Will Likely Cost Less than $1.75 Billion...DTC's estimate that the cost of to repack could exceed $2.9 billion is overstated. Simply using a realistic number of stations that require repacking and identifying cost estimates based on broadcasters' actual equipment would yield cost savings of as much as $1 billion or more. [It would need the 'or more' since that only takes it down to $1.9 billion]. Additional savings are possible and provide us with confidence that the congressionally mandated budget of $1.75 billion is realistic, if not generous, for the actual task at hand."
The incentive auction begins March 29, but that is simply the date by which broadcasters have to declare they are bidding and what options they will accept—giving up spectrum and getting out of the business, giving up spectrum and sharing channels, or moving to a different channel if that is an option.
Police have released video footage of a driver crashing into a pedestrian island while twice the drink-drive limit.
Holly Brown, of Aspen Grove, Aldershot, appeared at Guildford Magistrates' Court yesterday and pleaded guilty to the charge of drink-driving.
The 21-year-old was arrested after the accident in Guildford on December 6 and gave a positive breath reading of 72 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35 micrograms.
Brown was disqualified from driving for 20 months and fined £200. She was also ordered to pay a criminal courts charge of £150, victim surcharge of £20, and court costs of £87.
CCTV footage shows her car crashing into a traffic island in North Street at the junction with Chertsey Street in Guildford.
A Surrey Police spokesman said: "The video shows how members of the public came to her aid while passengers get out of the car and leave the scene.
"After getting out herself she gets back in and reverses away from the damaged railings and traffic light. She then drives into Chertsey Street, narrowly avoiding pedestrians in the road.
"Officers then found the vehicle in a car park near to Woodbridge Road with Brown still in the driver's seat with the keys in her hand."

Navy promotes SEAL commander in defiance of Congress
Posted on by ameribbean expat
The dispute represented a rare public challenge by senior military leaders to congressional oversight of the armed forces, and left lingering resentments on both sides. Lawmakers thought they had prevailed by blocking Loseys promotion last year, but the newly obtained documents reveal the Navy had the last word.

How did this guy go from USAFA grad to BUDS? Dont people that graduate from the Air Force Academy stay in the Air Force? Acadeny grads were always allowed to apply for a change of Service during their commissioning. It used to be quite popular to do so and many people would take any Academy Appointment they could get knowing they could just change their Service at graduation. The Services got tired of that practice so they made it harder to change a Service during graduation.

They need to ask Brian about Benghazi, he knows a lot of the truth. In 2002 I was sitting at my desk SWA when a Navy Commander came up and asked was I such and such. I responded yes where he held out his hand saying “Thank You”. Now I saw he was a Navy SEAL out of Afghanistan, so I said “For what? I am a REMF here, you were in harms way.” As I side note I was on the awards board getting a Bronze Star, and personally recommended him for a “V” because he was “behind the lines” doing his job. But I was told you only get a V for being under fire, not for being brave enough to mix among the enemy. I spent a day with him and can only quote Kipling about it: “ You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din!” Or in this case Brian Losey.

How did this guy go from USAFA grad to BUDS? Dont people that graduate from the Air Force Academy stay in the Air Force? Cadets from any service academy are allowed to try out for BUDS, well before graduation. If they pass, they stay at their academy but are commissioned in the US Navy. They are also allowed to be commissioned by another service if they are marrying someone in that service. In addition to those options, I believe they can petition for a change of service, subject to the needs of the Army/Navy/Air. I would bet on the first path.

The turmoil began in July 2011, three weeks after Losey took charge of the militarys Special Operations Command for Africa, headquartered in Stuttgart, Germany. Someone filed an anonymous complaint with the inspector general alleging that Losey had improperly sought a government-paid plane ticket for his adult daughter when his family relocated to Germany. In fact, Losey had paid for the plane ticket himself, and the complaint was soon dismissed. But enraged by what he saw as an act of disloyalty, the admiral became determined to find out who had reported him, according to the inspector general reports.

Education
A graduate of the United States Air Force Academy, class of 1983, Losey also holds a Masters degree in National Security Strategy from the National War College, which he received in 2004. He is a graduate of the Defense Language Institute, the Armed Forces Staff College, and Air Command and Staff College.[1] He attended Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training in Coronado, Calif., and graduated from BUD/S Class 126 in 1984.... On December 14, 2011, the U.S. Senate confirmed Losey's appointment as Rear Admiral (lower half).[4] On March 21, 2016, the Navy announced that Losey was being denied promotion to Rear Admiral (upper half) following the Inspector General's review of allegations of retaliation taken against subordinates (see detail below). The Navy simultaneously announced the planned retirement of Losey following a transition of command. Retaliation complaints
In 2011-2015, the Department of Defense Inspector General (DOD IG) investigated and upheld three out of five whistle-blower retaliation complaints against Admiral Losey after questioning 100 witnesses and amassing 300,000 pages of records. According to The Washington Post, Losey “was investigated five times by the Defense Departments inspector general after subordinates complained that he had wrongly fired, demoted or punished them during a vengeful but fruitless hunt for the person who had anonymously reported him for a minor travel-policy infraction.” The DOD IG found that Admiral Losey wrongly believed there was “a conspiracy to undermine his command”. Inspector General recommended that the Navy discipline Losey for violating whistleblower-protection laws. Navy leadership reviewed the DOD Inspector General report and concluded that “none of the allegations rose to the level of misconduct on Admiral Loseys part.” In a statement to the Congressional Record in December 2015, Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore) said he had placed a hold on the nomination of Janine Davidson, a former Pentagon official and Air Force pilot, to become the next Navy undersecretary until the service reconsidered its decision not to punish Admiral Losey for his violations of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989.[7] In April, 2016 the Navy decided to not promote Losey, paving the way for Davidsons appointment. Substantive support
William H. McRaven called him without a doubt one of the finest officers with whom I have ever served. Over the past 15 years no officer I know in the SEAL Teams has given more to this country than Brian.[9] He described it as an example of a disturbing trend in how politicians abuse and denigrate military leadership, particularly the officer corps, to advance their political agendas.[10] On the House floor, Retired SEAL officer-turned-Republican Congressman Ryan Zinke (R-MT), rejected claims that Losey retaliated. He saw a problem and took action. Once again, an entrusted, entrenched bureaucracy was allowed to hide behind threats, hide behind whistleblowers, hide behind rules that were intended to protect command and not to erode it. Source: Wikipedia

Lot of twists & turns in this case. The alleged travel violation was bogus & dismissed. Losey shook up a low performing staff that included two civilians (one the chief of staff) and one Air Force officer. He asked for things to get done or changed at a time when spec ops in Africa were booming because of the horrific Obama-Clinton-ValJar Arab Spring policy. Losey had commanded ST6 and expected instant obedience and results. After months when he didn't get them, he upended the entrenched bureaucracy, and then got smacked for it.

Toronto Maple Leafs fans are used to a face showing this emotion…
Agony.
The look on Henrik Lundqvist‘s face just after giving up the Stanley Cup winning goal to Alec Martinez is one of pure agony.
Sure, maybe the kind of agony that Toronto Maple Leafs fans would be willing to live with for a chance at the Stanley Cup Finals. But, agony nonetheless.
Despite the disappointment, the New York Rangers were a surprise as Eastern Conference Champions.
The Rangers didn't have a single point-per-game player and King Henrik suffered through the worst slump of his career. Rick Nash produced 39 points in 65 games. And Brad Richards was playing his way into an off-season buyout.
Not much for Leafs fans to be jealous of, right?
Yet, there they were, battling the Los Angeles Kings for the Cup. And that is cause for jealousy in Leaf land.
In this installment of the Eastern Conference Preview series, we'll examine the chances for the Rangers to repeat (or build?) on last season's stunning success.
Let's open with the positives on Broadway…
A British television commentator at the World Cup has been sacked after he was found to have passed on tickets, which were allegedly used by a group of young women as part of an ambush marketing effort.
Robbie Earle lost his job with ITV, after the station said a substantial number of tickets allocated to him for the Netherlands-Denmark match were used by beer company Bavaria Beer.

Budweiser, an official sponsor, is the only beer company allowed to advertise within the stadiums at the World Cup. FIFA fiercely protects its marketing interests, which are a major cash spinner for the organisation.
FIFA lawyers are looking into the effort, in which 36 women wore orange miniskirts.
For one year and five months, the First Lady oversaw her husband's affairs while he recovered from his illness. Some of her decisions had serious consequences.
Depending on what results at the end of this year's national quadrennial horse race (a.k.a. the presidential campaign), it may well be that America elects its first woman president.

Unofficially, America has already had what might be called a First Lady President — at least according to some historians and biographers of the controversial woman in question. And she certainly was not elected by anyone except, arguably her husband, who made their union official on December 18, 1915.

That happy occasion gave no clue that, in just three short years, Edith Bolling Galt — the widow of a Washington, D.C. jewelry store owner marrying the widowed incumbent President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson — would be accused of running the country.
The second Mrs. Woodrow Wilson seemed the least likely of women to seize control of the ultimate power to satisfy some personal desire for recognition. Born in 1872 to an impoverished family from mountainous western Virginia, her one flight of fancy was a distant descent from the legendary Native American princess Pocahontas. Never an intellect, she decided to leave Mary Washington College because her dormitory room was too cold. She instead followed an older sister and proceeded to the nation's capital where she quickly married a much older man from a family that owned and ran the city's oldest jewelry store.

As Mrs. Norman Galt, she gave birth to a son but the baby boy died within a few days. After 12 years of marriage, Edith found herself widowed but also wealthy. She began making frequent trips to Europe, where she developed a taste for the haute couture of the Parisian designer Worth. And when in Washington, she made a splash by becoming the first woman in town to drive her own car.
Despite her wealth and what one wag dubbed “kittenish” good looks, Mrs. Galt was barred from the echelons of capital high society simply because her wealth derived from a retail store, and she was snobbishly marked as “trade.” All that changed one chilly day in the early spring of 1915.
Edith Galt had been out with her friend Altrude Gordon, then dating Cary Grayson, the White House physician. Among his wards were not only President Woodrow Wilson, who was still mourning the death of his wife Ellen, but also the president's cousin Helen Bones who lived in the White House as a companion to him. That day, Miss Bones had joined Altrude and Edith on a relaxing but muddy hike. She coaxed them back to the White House for some warm tea. As Edith put it, she “turned a corner and met my fate.”

For Wilson it was love at first sight. Soon a presidential limousine hummed most nights outside Edith's door, ready to slip her over for romantic suppers while the next morning presidential messengers delivered suggestive love notes that flatteringly sought her apolitical opinion on issues ranging from the trustworthiness of Cabinet members to finessing diplomats as a war in Europe began to rapidly expand.
If Mrs. Galt was overwhelmed when the President insisted they get married, his political advisors were downright alarmed. Not only was Wilson entrusting this woman he'd only met three months earlier with classified information, he was up for re-election in 1916. Marrying Mrs. Galt barely a year after his first wife's death, they feared, would lead to his defeat. They crafted a plan. They would generate a series of fake love letters as if written from Wilson to a Mary Peck with whom he had conducted a real love affair of the heart, and leak it to the press. It would humiliate Mrs. Galt and she would flee.
Except, she didn't. She married the President and remembered those who had tried to rid him of her. Wilson won another term and, in April of 1917, led the U.S. into World War I. By then, Edith Wilson never left his presence, working together from a private, upstairs office. He gave her access to the classified document drawer and secret wartime code, and let her screen his mail. At the President's insistence, the First Lady sat in on his meetings, after which she gave him withering assessments of political figures and foreign representatives. She denied his advisors access to him if she determined the President couldn't be disturbed.
At war's end, Edith escorted Wilson to Europe so he could help negotiate and sign the Versailles Treaty and present his vision of a League of Nations to prevent any future world wars. When the Wilsons returned to the U.S., the honors of the old world gave way to the sober reality that the President would face enormous resistance among Senate Republicans in having his version of the League approved.
Exhausted, he nevertheless insisted on crossing the country by train to sell them on the idea, in October of 1919. There was little enthusiasm. He pushed harder. Then, he collapsed from physical exhaustion. Rushed back to the White House, he suffered a massive stroke. Edith found him unconscious on the floor of his bathroom. It was soon apparent to all that Wilson could not fully function.
Edith Wilson firmly stepped in and began making decisions. Consulting with physicians, she would not even consider making her husband resign and have the Vice President take over. That would only depress her Woodrow. Her loving dedication to protect him by whatever means were necessary might have been admirable for a love story, but in declaring that she only cared about him as a person, not as a president, Mrs. Wilson revealed a selfish ignorance leading her to decide that she and the President came before the normal functioning of the executive branch of government.

The first move in establishing what she called her “stewardship” was to mislead the entire nation, from the Cabinet to Congress to the press and the people. Vetting the carefully crafted medical bulletins that were publicly released, she would only permit an acknowledgement that Wilson badly needed rest and would be working from his bedroom suite. When individual Cabinet members came to confer the President, they went no further than the First Lady. If they had policy papers or pending decisions for him to review, edit or approve, she would first look over the material herself. If she deemed the matter pressing enough, she took the paperwork into her husband's room where she claimed she would read all the necessary documents to him.
It was a bewildering way to run a government, but the officials waited in the West Sitting Room hallway. When she came back to them after conferring with the President, Mrs. Wilson turned over their paperwork, now riddled with indecipherable margin notes that she said were the President's transcribed verbatim responses. To some, the shaky handwriting looked less like that written by an invalid and more like that of his nervous caretaker.
This is how she described the process she undertook:
“So began my stewardship. I studied every paper, sent from the different Secretaries or senators, and tried to digest and present in tabloid form the things that, despite my vigilance, had to go to the President. I myself never made a single decision regarding the disposition of public affairs. The only decision that was mine was what was important and what was not, and the very important decision of when to present matters to my husband.”
Luckily, the nation faced no great, looming crisis for the period of what some dubbed her “regency” of one year and five months, from October of 1919 until March of 1921. Still, some of her confrontations with officials had serious consequences. When she heard that the Secretary of State had convened a Cabinet meeting without Wilson's permission, she considered it an act of insubordination, and he was fired.
The most damaging irony, however, came as a result of Mrs. Wilson's insistence that a minor British Embassy aide be fired for a bawdy joke he'd cracked at her expense – or else she would refuse the credentials of an ambassador who had come to specifically help negotiate for President Wilson's version of the League of Nations. The Ambassador refused to do so and soon returned to London. For all of the protection she had provided for her husband as a person, Edith Wilson may well have damaged what he had dreamed for as a legacy.
Until her death in 1961, the former First Lady insisted that she never assumed the full power of the presidency, at best she used some of its prerogatives on behalf of a husband. Edith Wilson's “stewardship” is no reason to argue against electing a woman for President as much as it is a cautionary tale about love getting in the way of reason.
ELKO, Nev. -- A fossil found in northeastern Nevada shows a newly discovered fish species that scientists believe looked, and ate, like a shark.
The fossil is what remains of a bony, sharp-toothed fish that would have been about six-feet-long (1.83 meters) with long jaws and layers of sharp teeth.
The type of jaw and teeth on the fish suggest it would have chomped down on its prey before swallowing it whole, like a shark, the Reno Gazette-Journal reported.
"The surprising find from Elko County in northeastern Nevada is one of the most completely preserved vertebrate remains from this time-period ever discovered in the United States," said Carlo Romano of the University of Zurich, lead author of a Journal of Paleontology article about the find.

The fish, which researchers called Birgeria americana, predates Nevada's most famous fossil, the Ichthyosaur, by more than 30 million years. The Ichthyosaur was a 55-foot-long (16.76 meters) reptile. One of the largest concentrations of Ichthyosaur fossils was found near Berlin, Nevada. The find led to the Ichthyosaur becoming Nevada's state fossil.
The Birgeria americana fossil finding is important because it sheds light on how quickly large, predator species evolved following the Earth's third mass extinction that preceded the Triassic period about 250 million years ago.

The evidence shows the fish was alive and well about 1 million years after mass extinction 66 million years ago wiped out an estimated 90 percent of marine species.
It also shows a large fish was surviving in water previously thought to be too warm to support such life.
At the time, water near the equator, which is where land that became Nevada was positioned about 250 million years ago, could have been warmer than 96 degrees. "The eggs of today's bony fish can no longer develop normally" at such a high temperature, researcher said.
10-year-old boy stumbles across million-year-old fossil
Researchers learned of the fossil about five years ago after fossil collector Jim Jenks of West Jordan, Utah, stumbled upon it near Winecup Ranch north of Wells.
"It was just a very lucky find," said Jenks, who was credited among the paper's authors. "I happen to notice the teeth glinting in the sun. That is what caught my attention."
Jenks turned the fish over to the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, which has a large collection of fossils and connections with leading researchers.
Global consulting firm Accenture PLC has ended its relationship with Tiger Woods, marking the first major sponsor to cut ties altogether with the golfer since his alleged infidelities surfaced and he announced an indefinite leave from the sport to work on his marriage.
In its first statement since the Woods' scandal erupted, Accenture said Sunday the golfer is "no longer the right representative" after the "circumstances of the last two weeks."
The move ends a six-year relationship during which the firm credited its "Go on, be a Tiger" campaign with boosting its image significantly.
Accenture has used Woods to personify its claimed attributes of integrity and high performance.
"After careful consideration and analysis, the company has determined that he is no longer the right representative for its advertising," Accenture said, adding that "it wishes only the best for Tiger Woods and his family."
The firm plans to immediately transition to a new advertising campaign, with a major effort scheduled to launch later in 2010. An Accenture spokeswoman declined to comment further.
Advertising firm Young & Rubicam, which has handled the company's Tiger Woods ads, also would not comment on the move.
One of the risks of advertising tied to a celebrity is that "your image gets carried by someone you can't control," said Jonathan Bernstein, president of Bernstein Crisis Management.
Harambe , the ape who died and the meme that simply refuses to, is somehow still a source of ample new online #content. The latest tribute is a Backstreet Boys parody by a group of Swedish crooners who decided to ride the Harambe bandwagon the way Backstreet used to ride a meaty groove.
RandomMakingMovies' parody starts out shakily, without changing many of the original lyrics, but eventually arrives at the obvious punchline: “Dicks out for Harambe.”The slogan has become tired and overplayed in meme circles, but middle schoolers and college bros still seem to love it.
It also rehashes the old debate, unsettled and unsettleable, about whether the park service should have protected Harambe instead of the human child who fell into his enclosure. America is tired of this. There's no good answer for an all-around terrible situation, and the longer an online discussion about it goes on, the more likely it will veer into blatant racism.
In Sweden, though, it's apparently still a fun topic. Throw in a rap interlude capped off by vaping, and you've pretty much got the U.S. Internet 2016. This is what the rest of the world thinks of us, America, as we stand here with our dicks and our vapes defiantly out.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
So, I'll be honest with you, and it ain't no lie: I never wanna hear you say “Dicks out for Harambe.”

A Canadian forestry product exporter is suing one of China's State-owned logging companies operating in British Columbia for allegedly supplying “80% rotten logs” and tricking the exporter into assuming the forestry company's debts and tax obligations while failing to pay workers, according to a lawsuit filed at New Westminster law courts.
Baljit Gill, the founder and CEO of Surrey, BC-based Northcrest Energy Corp(NEC) is seeking damages of over $4 million from Richmond, BC-based Canada Forest Industrial Group Ltd (CFIG), its subsidiaries, and directors XueDian Liu, XinLin Huang, Ian Mallmann, Ling Jin, Jiaming Zhu, Wei Jiang and Paul Zhang – a prominent West Vancouver Realtor with Nu Stream Realty.
Corporate records for Canada Forest Industrial Group Ltd show it to be a fully-owned subsidiary of Zaozhuang Xin Zhong Xing (XZX) Industrial Company Ltd, which, according to Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) filings, is “a large, diversified state-owned Chinese corporation located in Zaozhuang, China.”
XueDian Liu, is listed as the President and CEO of both CFIG and and XZX.
Gill alleges in the complaint that CFIG's Chief Financial Officer Xinlin Huang of leading her to believe that CFIG was a major player who could supply NEC's needs.
“Ms. Huang repeatedly made, fraudulent and deceitful references, to her supposed access to both capital markets and “big wigs” in China – her successes in taking multiple Corporations public in Conjunction with her spouse Mr. Dennis Petke,” Ms. Gill states in the Notice of Claim filed on September 29. “These statements, slick presentations, communications via emails, telephone calls, Skype calls with supposed bigwigs' in China all were structured towards one purpose to induce and entice the plaintiff in invest heavily in a working relationship with the Defendants.”
Believing XinLin Huang's words, NEC agreed to pay CFIG's workers $3.2m in exchange for the forestry company shipping 30,000 Green Metric Tons in August 2016, the lawsuit states.
However, when the logs arrived in China in December 2016, Ms. Gill was alarmed to hear from her clients that the logs were of inferior quality, according to the complaint.
“Ms. Gill immediately notified CFIG when the shipment failed to the contracted quality and quantity requirements as the overseas client in China threatened to reject the entire order – seeking damages for the entire transaction amount, the ocean freight, China Port charges, Customs China in addition to additional damages,” the statement of claim reads.
As a result of CFIG's actions, the losses suffered by NEC's clients were $592,298.61, for which Gill sent a letter of claim to CFIG via a solicitor, according to the lawsuit.
But Gill soon found out that those losses were not her only problem, the lawsuit alleges.
Canada Revenue Agency informed Gill that CFIG had neglected to make mandatory payments to the CRA for employee deductions, and as NEC had been paying the employees on CFIG's behalf, the tax agency seized NEC's bank accounts, according to the lawsuit.
Realizing that CFIG's fraud was now no longer a civil matter, Gill filed a complaint for Criminal Fraud with the RCMP Forest Crime investigation Unit, the lawsuit claims.
According to the complaint, former employees and contractors for CFIG and its subsidiaries have not been paid and the Employees are pursuing a claim with Employment Standards against CFIG.
“They are fully aware of the agreement between” CFIG” and “NEC” and fully supportive of “NEC” and have been most vocal that this was a premeditated effort by “CFIG” to defraud all the parties,” the statement of claim reads. “It appears the additional claims and support of the employees of CFIG further lead the Plaintiffs to believe that the Defendants' endgame or intentions were to avoid meeting their contractual and statutory obligations while unjustly enriching themselves at the detriment of others.”
Gill is claiming in the lawsuit a certificate of pending litigation against the directors' properties, including Paul Zhang's two West Vancouver properties, as well as interlocutory injunctive relief to prevent the sale and/or transfer of assets of CFIG and its subsidiaries.
“Due to the magnitude of the civil fraud orchestrated by the Defendants and the fact that majority of the Directors of the firms are not resident in Canada with the remaining Directors' posing significant flight and asset risks to avoid compensating the Plaintiffs,” the Statement of Claim reads. “To this effect, the Plaintiffs' request the Courts to provide direction to the Canada Border Services Agency to prevent the flight of any and all Directors/Defendants.”
“The seriousness and complexity of the intricate fraudulent scheme orchestrated by the Defendants to unjustly enrich themselves to the severe detriment and hardship of the Plaintiffs – causing long lasting financial and reputational damage to the Plaintiffs' (the full extent of which is still being assessed necessitating the requirement for the Defendants' records),” Gill concludes in the complaint. “For their reprehensible damage to the Plaintiffs and to prevent further fraudulent activity impacting the Plaintiff and others, the Courts are requested to remove the Defendants' from serving as Directors or Officers of any firms registered and operating in British Columbia, Canada.”
“I can confirm that we have received a report and are now in the process of reviewing the information to determine whether an investigation will be warranted,” RCMP Cpl. Janelle Shoihet told ThinkPol in an email.
Defendant Xinlin Huang denies the claims made by NEC.
“CFIG has been made aware of a claim made against it and others by Northcrest Energy Corp and Baljit Gill,” Huang told ThinkPol. “The allegations being made are without merit and will be defended vigourously. Legal counsel have been retained and have been instructed to take steps to have the claim struck.”
We have reached out to Paul Zhang for comment, but have not yet heard back from them.
We were unable to reach any officials from the Employment Standards Branch of the BC Ministry of Labour for comment.
None of the allegations the defendants has been tested in court.
ThinkPol needs your help to keep going.

As final migration statistics roll in for 2016, Italy has surpassed Greece as the principal port of entry for migrants trying to reach Europe.
Although final figures won't be known until the year ends, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has released a summary report for immigration into Europe for 2016, confirming that Italy is now Europe's number one recipient of migrants.
“Italy saw a 115% increase in cumulative arrivals from 2015 (177,729 in 2016 versus 153,842 in 2015),” the report states, “while Greece saw 83% decrease in cumulative arrivals from 2015 (175,666 arrivals in 2016 versus 1,033,029 in 2015).”
Combined arrivals to Greece and Italy account for 93 percent of the total 381,307 arrivals in 2016 (as of December 14, 2016). Of these, nearly all new arrivals in 2016 have come to Europe by sea (93.6 percent). Only 6.3 percent of migrants have entered Europe by land, through Bulgaria, Greece and Spain.
Much of the migratory shift has been due to a deal between Turkey and the European Union (EU) in March of 2016, which effectively sealed up the so-called “Balkan route”—the previous path of choice for those attempting to reach Europe.
The shift from Greece to Italy has also entailed a major change in the demographic make-up of arriving migrants. Whereas migrants and refugees journeying from Turkey into Greece were primarily Syrian (46.6 percent), Afghan (24.2 percent) and Iraqi (15.2 percent), the migrants reaching Italian shores have been overwhelmingly African, with Nigeria in the first place, followed by Eritrea, Guinea, Côte d'Ivoire, Gambia, Senegal, Mali and Sudan.
The composition of new migrants also underscores the fact that nearly all new arrivals are economic migrants looking for a better life and benefits in Europe, rather than refugees fleeing wars and crisis situations.
The majority of the migrants are males (71 percent) and according to Professor Anna Bono of the University of Turin, an expert in African migration, most are young and belong to the middle class.
Bono said that human traffickers in African countries promote emigration to Italy through extensive ad campaigns promising a warm welcome and extensive welfare assistance.
“In the countries of sub-Saharan Africa there are advertisements inciting people to go to Italy, explaining that everything here is free,” she said.
More disturbingly, Nigerian traffickers are exploiting Europe's migrant crisis to take girls across the Mediterranean into Italy to sell into prostitution. In the past two years, more than 12,000 girls and young women have arrived in Italy—six times as many as in the preceding two years. Of these, four out of five (79 percent) have wound up in prostitution.
Currently, half of the prostitutes in Italy are Nigerians.
Arinze Orakwe, an official of the Nigerian anti-trafficking organization NAPTIP, said that fighting against the traffickers is an uphill battle, in part because of public opinion and propaganda about life in Europe. “Everyone thinks that the streets of Europe are paved with gold,” he said.
Even as colder temperatures set in, there has been no let-up in the numbers of sub-Saharan Africans arriving in Italy. In the week from Dec. 6-12, new arrivals totaled 2,535, while for the following week of Dec. 13-19, the numbers were slightly higher, at 2,712 arrivals.
With the new data factored in, the total number of migrants entering Italy in 2016 has exceeded 180,000, the highest recorded yearly number in modern history.

Pierre Poilievre didn't get a lot of ink when he announced that Conservatives would stick with the existing system for electing Members of Parliament.
The system – known as first past the post — has worked well enough for 150 years and the government sees no compelling reason to change it now, he noted.
“Every time Canadians have voted on this, they chose to keep the current system. We will continue to respect the democratic will of Canadians,” said Poilievre, the Minister for Democratic Reform.
It may be singularly Conservative, of course, that the Minister for Democratic Reform would be against Democratic Reform, but hardly a surprise. The news would have been if the Tories had suddenly thrown in their lot with the other two major parties and pledged to abandon the system that got them elected, as it has every other government since 1867. Poilievre had
“We believe in the parliamentary system in which members of Parliament are responsible to their constituents and must go back to their geographical constituency for reaffirmation in every single election cycle. That is responsible government and that is what we support.”
already spoken on the topic in the House of Commons, noting:
But even though it quickly got overwhelmed in the news cycle, it seems likely the issue will return in more intense form. There's an election coming, it's a policy with profound implications, and there's a clear divide between the Liberals and NDP on one side, and the Conservatives on the other. You could eliminate the Senate tomorrow and the practical impact on the country would be marginal, but abandon the electoral system and take up one of dozens of other options, and everything about future governments, and how the country is run, would be changed, in ways voters have yet to begin considering. The fact that Liberal leader Justin Trudeau's pledge to toss out the existing system for some new, unspecified alternative has sparked so little interest beyond Ottawa just underlines again how little attention Canadians pay to politics until an election comes along and hits them in the face.
Trudeau doesn't have an alternative plan, he just wants change now, with details to come later. The Liberals supported the old system as long as it delivered them majorities, but it's been 15 years and four leaders (plus a couple of interims) since those happy days, so now they want something new. Fair enough, but shouldn't Trudeau at least be able to specify which alternative he'd introduce? Or, failing that, pledge to hold a referendum when the choice is finally made, so the ultimate decision will belong to Canadian voters?
He isn't committed to either. He would “consult Canadians,” he says, but without getting specific on how that would happen. He would prefer an all-party committee to study proposals and bring forward a recommendation. We don't know how the committee would be chosen, how seats would be apportioned, or who would have the final say. Presumably there would be a vote in Parliament. Should the existing system give the Liberals a majority in October, they would have the power to select any choice they prefer. Thus, the system Trudeau wants to dump would be the basis of his power to impose a new one of his choice. Should the Liberal majority result from less than 50% of the popular vote – which is not only possible but highly probable – he would have that ability even though more than half the country voted against him. Liberals are constantly beefing that 60% of Canadians voted against the Conservatives, but they would be happy to claim the same incongruity gives them the right to upend the electoral system to something wholly new and untried.

Why are they against a referendum? The answer is simple: given the choice in Ontario and British Columbia, Canadians voted against plans similar to Trudeau's. Once they confront the implications of proportional representation, Canadians become understandably wary. MPs without constituencies, fringe parties holding a disproportionate share of power, unstable coalition governments based on back-room horse-trading that treats critical ministries like hockey cards to be bartered for favours…
The Liberals sought a similar upheaval once before, when Stephane Dion proposed restructuring the national economy based on his ill-defined “Green Shift” carbon tax plan. Even though voters approved of his concern for the environment, they were unconvinced they needed the sort of revolutionary change Dion advocated. Trudeau may find they have the same doubts once he starts trying to answer questions about his similarly radical proposal.
And the questions will come. The Conservatives can be counted on to ensure they're asked, and appropriately so. The Liberal leader remains big on sweeping pledges and broad generalizations, but his policy ideas to date have been marked by a lack of specifics, and he continues to look jittery when pressed for more detail. Confronted during debates with a demand for answers, will he have them? Will Canadians be content to take a leap in the dark based solely on trust that the Liberals will make the right decision in the end?
That's a lot of trust to put in a party led by an inexperienced leader with a policy containing so many questions and so few answers. Canada exists because its original settlers rejected revolution. It would be unusual for their offspring to bet the farm now on something so uncertain.

Early in the word-processing era, it was difficult or in some cases impossible to italicize words, and so one underlined them instead. When doing so, a colleague of mine always took special care not to underline the spaces between the words of a title. That is, instead of The Winds of War, he would write The Winds of War. He endured the chore of several additional keystrokes because he felt that a line under a space is meaningless. This was not unreasonable, but may have put too fine a point on it.
Putting too fine a point on it is the essence of shibboleths. Shibboleth is a Hebrew agriculture term. The modern use of it comes from a biblical story about a war between the Gileadites and the Ephraimites, whose dialect did not include the /ʃ/, or sh, sound. The Gileadites won a battle and devised a strategy to determine whether or not each captive was from the enemy camp. In the words of the Book of Judges, “the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay; Then said they unto him, Say now ‘Shibboleth': and he said ‘Sibboleth': for he could not frame to pronounce it right.”
In language, a shibboleth is a usage that members of a certain group engage in not for meaning or elegance but in order to recognize each other (and exclude everybody else). Sometimes it reflects the state of the language decades or centuries before; other times it doesn't have even that justification. My first boss, Myron (Mike) Kolatch, the erstwhile editor of The New Leader magazine, was all about the shibboleths. In addition to the usual ones (don't use which for restrictive clauses, quantities require more than and not over, don't use anxious to mean eager or since to mean because or aggravate to mean anything except the worsening of a condition), he had a few rules that I've never encountered since. One was that just was permissible just only in reference to time, as in “We had just arrived.” And only could be used only in situations of uniqueness, hence, “I am only merely trying to make the magazine conform to proper English.” I cannot hear the word merely without thinking of Mike.
A recent Quartz article that went mildly viral, “20 Misused Words That Make Smart People Look Silly,” featured a number of pairs of words that are commonly or at least occasionally actually muffed: accept/except, infer/imply, lie/lay. But it also went all in on some hoary shibboleths that I don't believe even Mike Kolatch subscribed to. For example,
“Bring” and “take” both describe transporting something or someone from one place to another, but the correct usage depends on the speaker's point of view. Somebody brings something to you, but you take it to somewhere else: “Bring me the mail, then take your shoes to your room.”
Give me a break. No one would ever say “Take me the mail,” and there is absolutely nothing wrong with “Bring your shoes to the room.” You just (sorry, Mike) have to imagine the action from the point of view of the room. As Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage (M-WDEU) says, “A native speaker of English will hardly ever misuse bring or take; the problem exists in the minds of the usage commentators who have formulated incomplete rules for the use of bring.”
The article also cautions, “Nauseous means causing nausea; nauseated means experiencing nausea.” This is a case of following usage that was in force circa 1916, but not for very long after that. Even in its 1994 edition, M-WDEU could observe, “Any handbook that tells you nauseous cannot mean ‘nauseated' is out of touch. In current use it seldom means anything else.”
All this shouldn't be taken to mean I have no Gileadite tendencies. I would wager that all of us in this language-pundit game have our idiosyncratic prejudices, even Geoffrey Pullum. We cannot justify them rationally, but we carry them with us like talismans, warding off who knows what.
As it happens, the Quartz article included my own personal favorite shibboleth: “Farther refers to physical distance, while further describes the degree or extent of an action or situation. ‘I can't run any farther,' but ‘I have nothing further to say.'” True to form, M-WDEU demurs, pointing out that further and farther are historically the same word, and that both have been used by the best writers in both contexts for centuries. (However, the most recent citation for farther-meaning-additional is Edith Wharton, 1920: “He became aware that Mr. Jackson was clearing his throat preparatory to farther revelations.”)
I don't care. I am committed to reserving farther for distance, both literal and metaphorical (“Trump has gone farther than previous candidates in making outrageous statements.”). When I get back a manuscript on which an editor has changed one of my farthers to a further, I take a palpable pleasure in restoring the original — much, I imagine, as my friend did in removing the underlines from spaces between the words of a title.
Annie Dookhan, the drug analyst who tampered with evidence and jeopardized tens of thousands of criminal convictions, was sentenced Friday to three to five years in state prison, closing a sorrowful chapter for the woman at the center of a scandal that continues to plague the state's criminal justice system.
The 36-year-old mother of a disabled child, whose marriage fell apart in the months after the scandal, softly pleaded guilty to 27 counts of misleading investigators, filing false reports, and tampering with evidence. She must also serve two years of probation and undergo mental health counseling, if needed.
After the sentence was handed down, Dookhan struggled to hold back tears as she whispered with her lawyer before being led away in handcuffs by court officers. Two family members, believed to be her parents, watched from the courtroom gallery.

Attorney General Martha Coakley, whose office prosecuted the case, said in an interview later that the conviction of Dookhan was only one part of an ongoing investigation into the quality of drug testing at the Hinton drug lab, but she said it was needed to bring some accountability for her crimes.

“Certainly one of the victims in this case, and the actions of Annie Dookhan, is the public trust,” Coakley said.
Dookhan's lawyer, Nicolas A. Gordon, would not comment after Friday's hearing. He had asked Suffolk Superior Court Judge Carol S. Ball to sentence Dookhan to no more than a year in prison.
Dookhan admitted to filing false test results and mixing drug samples, and to later lying under oath about her job qualifications, but she said it was only to boost her work performance.
Prosecutors had asked that Dookhan serve 5 to 7 years in prison, but Ball kept to her earlier decision that she would sentence the chemist to 3 to 5 years, finding that, while Dookhan was a “broken person who has been undone by her own ambition,” the consequences of her crimes were still “nothing short of catastrophic.”

State Representative Bradley H. Jones Jr., the House Republican leader, expressed disappointment with the sentence.
“You walk away feeling this is really inadequate to what has happened, and the ramifications that it has had, and is going to have, on the criminal justice system,” Jones said. “Three to five years is not adequate.”
Developments in the scandal went beyond Dookhan's plea and sentencing. The Globe learned Friday night that State Police have fired a drug analyst who worked with Dookhan at the lab when it was run by the Department of Public Health. The former analyst, Kate A. Corbett, was fired for allegedly falsely claiming in court testimony that she had a bachelor's degree in chemistry, according to a source familiar with the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly.
David Procopio, a spokesman for the State Police, would only say that the analyst — he did not identify Corbett by name — was fired after State Police took over the lab and began reviewing employees. He said investigators found discrepancies in what she stated about her academic record, and the discrepancies have been referred to prosecutors and defense attorneys already involved in the Dookhan scandal.
David L. Ryan/Globe Staff Dookhan was led away by a court officer on Friday after the hearing in Suffolk Superior Court.
By all accounts, the scandal at the Hinton laboratory in Jamaica Plain is the worst to hit the state's criminal justice system in recent memory, and is still deepening. Officials have determined that Dookhan was involved in more than 40,000 cases at the lab from 2003-2012, possibly tainting the integrity of the evidence in those cases.

Defendants have asked that their convictions be tossed, or that they be released from prison as they seek new trials. Public safety officials feared their release would create a crime wave. So far, the state has spent $8.5 million reviewing the drug cases and holding special hearings for defendants, and officials have budgeted an additional $8.6 million, expecting the costs to increase.
As of Nov. 5, according to the state Trial Court, 950 people have been given special Superior Court hearings in eight counties, from Worcester east. Overall, through Nov. 5, the courts have held 2,922 hearings — in addition to their regular caseload — for defendants asking that their cases be dismissed or that they be released from jail.
By August, a year after the extent of Dookhan's crimes were first discovered, a Globe review of court records showed that more than 600 defendants had convictions against them erased or temporarily set aside, or they have been released on bail pending new trials.
Of those, at least 83 defendants — about 13 percent of the total — had been arrested and charged with other crimes.
In one case, a Brockton man released from prison last fall because Dookhan was involved in his case was arrested for allegedly killing a man in a drug dispute in May.
Cape & Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe said that the lab scandal has burdened district attorneys and the courts. At times, the courts have had to release prisoners or grant them new trials “in the interests of fair justice,” he said.
“It's something that we're going to be trying to correct for quite a period of time,” O'Keefe said.
But he and defense lawyers also agreed that the woes will not end with Dookhan's sentence.
Defense lawyers have called on the state Trial Court to set up an independent special court system to review evidence that was handled not only by Dookhan, but by anyone from the Hinton laboratory. The lab, which was closed by State Police in 2012, handled more than 190,000 cases since the early 1990s.
The state Office of Inspector General is also conducting an independent probe to determine whether the laboratory followed its own policies and whether those policies met national standards, said Jack Meyers, a spokesman.
“The chapter in Annie Dookhan's life is over, but the story goes on for the thousands of individuals who have been affected by her conduct, by the conditions of the lab, and by the effect that it has had on the criminal justice system as a whole,” said Anthony J. Benedetti, chief counsel for the Committee for Public Counsel Services, which represents poor clients, and represented the majority of the Dookhan-related defendants.

TPP Deal Puts BC's Privacy Laws in the Crosshairs read more
Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners ‘Punch to the Gut' Musical on Residential Schools Returns to Vancouver Children of God has been shaped by intense audience reactions, says director Corey Payette.
Would you sign an important deal where the details were secret until after your name was inked on the page?
An agreement that you are told will be great, but could either cost you your job or boost your pay, help or hurt your working conditions, and allow you to be sued if you break the rules you haven't yet seen?
Of course not. That would be insane.
But that's exactly what Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservative government wants to do -- sign a deal we can't see that affects trade with 11 other countries, including major partners the United States and Japan.
You've probably never even heard of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, but Canadian International Trade Minister Ed Fast flies to Hawaii on July 28 for meetings that could finalize the secret negotiations.
However, big business sure knows the TPP -- and loves it.
"The TPP is the biggest game on the planet in terms of trade negotiations," wrote the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, and the Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters in a letter endorsing the unseen deal.
But not so fast, Fast, said Don Davies, Vancouver Kingsway MP and NDP trade critic.
"We've got to wait and see the actual text of the agreement, consider it, consult the public and then decide," Davies told me this week. "The Conservative government approach to trade is to conduct negotiations in utter, total secrecy -- they've shut out Parliament."
Canadians are totally in the dark, Davies said, but not big business because "a select group of insiders has been briefed on it."
'We have to be defensive': NDP's Davies
In fact, the only real details emerging from TPP talks came when WikiLeaks published a secret draft chapter in January detailing how foreign companies would be able to directly "sue" governments through an Investor State Dispute Settlement process outside of Canada's legal system.
That means multinationals could force taxpayers to compensate them for any health, environmental, land use, financial or other government policies that they claim don't give them "fair and equal treatment."
The biggest possible threats to Canada include our dairy and poultry industries, where "supply management" regulations protect domestic farmers -- that is, marketing boards that regulate domestic production and put high import tariffs on foreign producers.
TPP also endangers copyright and privacy protection laws as outlined in The Tyee, with TPP being described as "digital free trade."
Davies is concerned about what he knows of the TPP, and more concerned about what he doesn't. But he is careful not to say that the TPP should be rejected sight unseen, nor endorsed without knowing the details.
"There is a potential plus to being at the table and in an agreement, but there are also threats," Davies said. "This is a U.S.-dominated trade deal -- and they protect their interests.
"Canadians should approach TPP with a balanced perspective. There is a cost of being out. We have to be defensive," he said.
That view contrasts with Harper's heavy emphasis on getting a deal and telling Canadians to trust him, and the federal Liberals' position of endorsing the TPP while wringing their hands and saying they'd try to improve it later, as they did on Bill C-51, the Conservative security legislation.
"It would be really devastating for Canada to be left on the outside, and it's the job of the government to negotiate a deal that benefits all sectors of the economy, absolutely including the supply-managed industries," Liberal MP and trade critic Chrystia Freeland said in June.
Kind of hard to tell how devastating when we don't know almost anything about it, other than it's very secret.
Davies said that's the Conservative approach to trade deals.
"Negotiate in secret, put a gun to the heads of your opponents, and try to force them to agree," Davies said. "Ultimately it's unproductive."
Deal about 'containing China': law expert
The list of countries involved in the TPP is also bizarre, with no obvious linkages: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam.
The exclusions have led many observers to conclude the deal is aimed at reducing the influence of China.
"The trade deal isn't primarily significant because of the economy. It matters because it's part of the broader American geostrategic goal of containing China -- which pointedly hasn't been invited to join the TPP," writes Noah Feldman, a Harvard professor of international law.
Meanwhile, Davies worries about how well-protected Canadians will be in a trade agreement with Brunei and Vietnam, which are not democracies.
"We are dealing with countries that do not meet normative, minimal standards in labour, human and environmental rights," Davies said, noting that Brunei has imposed a law that can punish same-sex acts with stoning to death.
American legislators are equally unhappy.
"A country that has laws that are anathema to American values doesn't deserve to be in our trade negotiations," said California Democratic Representative John Garamendi. "We need to send a clear message."
Malaysia is also repressive to gay, lesbian and transgendered people, whose rights are routinely violated by federal and state authorities.
So far, Canada's message has been clear -- no rights, no problem.
Unprecedented and unwarranted secrecy
And then there's the unprecedented secrecy surrounding all aspects of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
The TPP draft chapter released by WikiLeaks shows that the U.S. has classified the text to keep it a secret.
"Even if current negotiations over the trade agreement end with no deal, the draft chapter will still remain classified for four years as national security information," law professor Margot Kaminski wrote in the New York Times.
"National security secrecy may be appropriate to protect us from our enemies; it should not be used to protect our politicians from us," she wrote.
Outspoken U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont agrees.
"It is incomprehensible to me that the leaders of major corporate interests are actively involved in the writing of the TPP, while the elected officials of this country have little or no knowledge as to what is in it," Sanders said.
But U.S. President Barack Obama, with support primarily from Republican legislators, got approval to "fast track" TPP negotiations with minimal interference.
Secrecy, violation of human rights by potential partners -- none of these worries big business in the least.
In one of a series of opinion pieces salted through major media, the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters even had the nerve to say that TPP endorsement is a no-brainer, unless -- shudder -- "partisan politics" intervene.
"Canada's participation in TPP should not be a tough decision, and even with an election looming, it is too important to be held hostage to partisan politics. Canada needs to be part of the TPP deal as soon as it is concluded," wrote CMA vice-president Jeff Brownlee.
Never mind that the most partisan prime minister Canada has seen is pushing the TPP through without legislative scrutiny or public consultation -- what's good for big business should be good for everyone!
Nice try. Here's the real bottom line on the TPP: no details, no deal. It's that simple.
Both Facebook and Twitter joined the growing number of tech companies defending Apple's decision to fight a court order to help the FBI break into the iPhone 5c used by San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook. 24 hours earlier, it was Google backing up Apple over the government's overreach — albeit with less decisive language — while WhatsApp co-founder and CEO Jan Koum voiced his support for Apple CEO Tim Cook on Facebook yesterday.
"We will continue to fight aggressively against requirements for companies to weaken the security of their systems," Facebook said. The company's entire statement follows below:
We condemn terrorism and have total solidarity with victims of terror. Those who seek to praise, promote, or plan terrorist acts have no place on our services. We also appreciate the difficult and essential work of law enforcement to keep people safe. When we receive lawful requests from these authorities we comply. However, we will continue to fight aggressively against requirements for companies to weaken the security of their systems. These demands would create a chilling precedent and obstruct companies' efforts to secure their products.
Meanwhile, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted this afternoon, saying, "We stand with @tim_cook and Apple (and thank him for his leadership)!" before linking to Cook's defiant statement posted on Apple's website yesterday. Microsoft expressed tepid support earlier today by sharing a letter from Reform Government Surveillance (RGS), of which Microsoft is a founding member, that said "technology companies should not be required to build in backdoors to the technologies that keep their users' information secure."
"Those demands would create a chilling precedent ..."
Apple's decision to fight the order demanding it effectively hack its own system for the FBI is drawing a stark line through the ranks in Washington and Silicon Valley. On one side is a group — comprised mostly of technology executives — who see the request as a fundamental violation of consumer privacy. The other end, which includes lawmakers and the likes of Donald Trump, consider Apple's staunch refusal as a serious roadblock in the fight against domestic terrorism. The case, which Apple may fight all the way up to the Supreme Court, is the most significant battle yet in the ongoing encryption debate.
We stand with @tim_cook and Apple (and thank him for his leadership)! https://t.co/XrnGC9seZ4 — Jack (@jack) February 18, 2016
While the tech industry appears to be joining hands unilaterally in its defense of Apple, lawmakers are more of a mixed bag. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said today his office has 175 iPhones involved in criminal cases that cannot be broken into due to the device's strong encryption. With support from NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton, Vance said Apple and Google are "acting like teenagers saying ‘nobody can tell me what to do,'" and added that the situation "has become, ladies and gentlemen, the wild west of technology. And Apple and Google are their own sheriffs."
"Apple and Google are their own sheriffs."
Members of the Democratic House Judiciary Committee — Reps. John Conyers, Jerrold Nadler, Zoe Lofgren, and Sheila Jackson Lee — contested the order on the grounds it was being used to undermine the legislative process around demanding encryption backdoors.
"There is little reason for the government to make this demand on Apple — except to enact a policy proposal that has gained no traction in Congress and was rejected by the White House," the lawmakers said in a statement. "Properly understood, strong encryption is our best defense against online criminals — including terrorist organizations. It is the backbone of the Internet economy and vital for the protection of both free expression and privacy."
Update at 7:07PM ET February 18th: Added Facebook's statement in full and additional details.
Nike are bringing the curtain down on another memorable season for Cristiano Ronaldo in assured style with the announcement of a new limited edition CR7 Nike Mercurial Vapor IX.
Ronaldo has chalked up another barnstorming season in Madrid, averaging over 1 goal per game, becoming the clubs the fastest ever player to 200 goals and deservedly being honoured as the best player in the world this year at the Ballon d'Or ceremony in January.
Limited to just 100 pairs, these Vapor IX's will surely be a favourite amongst collectors thanks to a clean look of white, black and metallic gold coin on the soleplate.
Nike says this colourway is a knowing nod to CR7's affinity for white football boots, with the gold marking his achievements coating his preferred SG-Pro hybrid soleplate.
Ronaldo will give a debut to these stunningly simple cleats as Real Madrid take on Barcelona in an ‘El Clasico' Copa del Rey final on April 16th, giving Cristiano Ronaldo a golden opportunity (sorry) to make this colourway a memorable one by capturing some silverware whilst wearing them.
Limited to just 100 pairs, the Cristiano Ronaldo Limited Edition Nike Mercurial Vapor IX will go on sale today at £180 in the UK, and will – as mentioned – be limited to just 100 pairs.
Will you be picking up a pair?

American Atheists is proud to announce that Glenwood Elementary in the McDowell County (NC) School District, has apologized for the unconstitutional “I love Jesus because ___” controversy.
An article I wrote here on FtB last week sounded the alert, and the secular internet community reacted strongly. Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media support is often crucial to our success at American Atheists (I'm the Military Director at American Atheists).
Here are the results, for now.
Becky Pearson at McDowell County School District relayed the corrective actions taking place at Glenwood Elementary, as well as ‘their side' of the story.
SGT Griffith, Here is an account of what has transpired since Friday. Glenwood Elementary has participated in Samaritan's Purse Operation Christmas Child for the last 2 years. This has been a great service project for students to participate in voluntarily and has allowed teachers to integrate geography lessons as students study maps to see various countries where the boxes are delivered as well as writing lessons where students may choose to write letters to children around the world who will receive the boxes. Principal, Amy Dowdle has worked closely with a volunteer from Samaritan's Purse to create a service learning project that connects the children of Glenwood to less fortunate children from around the world. She made sure that parents were informed of the school's participation in the program and that individual student participation was completely voluntary. The issue that has risen this year is that as part of the materials provided from Samaritan's Purse included a “fill in the blank” letter for younger students K-2 that allowed them to simply fill in such information as their name and age instead of having to create an entire letter on their own. One of the sentences in that letter was “I love Jesus because….”. This letter was provided to younger students as a voluntary center activity . No child was forced to participate or called out for answering or not answering any or all of the questions involved. Our local paper, the McDowell News contacted the Samaritan's Purse volunteer via email Friday morning and said that they had received “some e-mails and one letter to the editor that students were given a questionnaire during this school event that asked them to list the reasons why they love Jesus.” Ms. Smith immediately contacted Mrs.Dowdle. Mrs. Dowdle was unaware that the form asked children to answer this question that was religious in nature. She immediately sent an email reply to our local paper and a Connect-Ed call to her parents and staff Friday night acknowledging the mistake, reassuring her parents and staff that she will carefully inspect materials to ensure that none of them contain matters that are religious in nature in the future and apologized for offending anyone. On Monday, Mrs. Dowdle met with her faculty and staff and reiterated her stance on the issue. Letters were also sent home with all students. Mrs. Dowdle also participated in an interview with our local paper and Asheville TV station, WLOS. Please let me know if you need any further information. Thank you, Becky — Becky Pearson Assistant Superintendent for Instructional Services McDowell County Schools
It's encouraging to know that so many of you actually followed through on my requests to contact the Superintendent of the school district, as well as the media outlets. For the most part, it worked. It generated awareness and real-world change.
But it was only a first step. Operation Christmas Child as a whole, needs to go.
As Operation Christmas Child freely admits on their FAQ:
Q. WHAT IS THE MISSION OF OPERATION CHRISTMAS CHILD?
A. The mission of Operation Christmas Child is to demonstrate God's love in a tangible way to needy children around the world, and together with the local church worldwide, to share the Good News of Jesus Christ.
Bibles are still included as a part of the boxes that OCC sends. Christian literature, and themes are still present in many of the objects that can be stuffed into the boxes.
So we still have some work to do.
My response to the McDowell County School District:
Mrs. Pearson, … Thank you for the update, and the written clarification. As per our conversation, I'm pleased to write about positive developments. Such a rapid rush to apologize for mistakes is most welcome. Admitting the inappropriate nature of this was a great start. Likewise, the promise to remove the form is fantastic. I mentioned in our phone call that I wanted to print your updates to the situation. It is extremely well written, and I'd like to share it verbatim. You deserve to have this opportunity, and I thank you for providing such a succinct written account. The atheist community will appreciate this. However, there needs to be a closer look at this Operation Christmas Child, as it most certainly has a singular purpose of converting children to Christianity (be it in this country or not). All of the videos associated with this effort (self-produced) brag about this being the point of the entire operation. This operation was designed for churches, and that's exactly where it should stay. No part of this operation is acceptable, ‘I love Jesus because…' form or not. I understand the urge for damage control may want you to sugar coat that, but it's true. Watch any of their videos, it's an undeniable and inappropriate goal for a public school to endorse (optionally or not). We understand that religious activities may be a part of students' lives. But there is a huge difference between supporting a religious demographic, and supporting the growth of one over others. By definition, converting a child to Christianity involves removing a child from their previous religious affiliation. This has no place in government. If you still think this program is acceptable for your school district, I just a few questions. Would you support such an effort from an atheist group? Packing boxes with toys and copies of atheist literature, etc… I'm hoping you say ‘no' and that this causes you to also reconsider your position with the Christian membership drive that Mrs. Dowdle volunteers for – with your public school students. And what about supporting other efforts from atheist groups, which were not focused on ‘de-converting' children? (Perhaps, simply a group of atheists who donate toys and clothing with no atheist literature. Or a group of atheists wanting to do a 5k run that raises money for cancer research, etc.) The answer should be ‘yes' here. Very respectfully, Justin Griffith Military Director – American Atheists, Inc. Fort Bragg, NC
This is not the first time that I've put out a request for help that was massively successful because of the public and legal pressure it generated. In the last year, I've learned that those two things are the only forces that work when the system is broken.
I'm proud of you, internet atheists. Crowd-sourced activism is like an effective Lorax, speaking for those who can't.
How you can help (again)
If you want to help, you still can. You should let them know that a Christian membership drive is not appropriate for government-funded public schools. Respectfully express your outrage that more wasn't done.
Contact the McDowell County School District, and raise your concerns.

While our legal and fundraising teams mull over the prospects of suing to get this entire Operation dropped from the public school agenda, perhaps they will see the light.
A feline in the US has broken the Guinness world record for world's longest domestic cat.
The Reno Gazette-Journal reports that a five-year-old Maine Coon named Stewie was certified as the new record holder after measuring 123.2cm from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail bone.
Robin Henderson stretches out her Maine Coon cat Stewie, who has just claimed the record as the world's longest cat. Credit:AP
That's a little more than 1.2 metres long.
The record was previously held by another Maine Coon that measured 121.9cm.
Stewie's owners, Robin Hendrickson and Erik Brandsness, say they decided to try for the record after hearing countless people say they were amazed by Stewie's length.
Mr Hendrickson said Maine Coons were known as "the gentle giants" of the cat world.
A celebration of European maritime communities is to be held tomorrow Tuesday (May 21st) but who here has heard of it?
We are a small island in the North Atlantic but thanks to our sea territory we're also one of the biggest countries in Europe so you would imagine some maritime folk at least would be interested in celebrating this EU backed promotion of something so crucial to our island life.
Ireland is the third biggest country in the European Union by virtue of our claimed seabed territory of 220 million acres.
Unfortunately a quick check of the Google Ireland index confirms the international date does not figure high on any Irish government website.
Five different Government Departments deal with aspects of Ireland's maritime sphere.
We emailed the Department of the Marine about the celebrations but we got no response.
This is surprising given our current EU role and the recently adopted European Atlantic Action Plan designed to complement the Integrated Marine Plan for Ireland "Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth" launched by An Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, T.D., in July 2012.
The aim of European Maritime Day is to provide an occasion to highlight the crucial role that oceans and seas play in the everyday life not only of coastal communities, but of all EU citizens, and for Europe's sustainable growth and jobs at large, and to encourage better stewardship of coastal zones, seas and oceans by all citizens and actors concerned.
Of course our own very active coastal communities have put their future in good hands for some time now. Their own. But there is only so much isolated little harbour towns can do on their own.
A marine alliance of these communities and fishing and boating sectors could forge a national voice for a maritime nation. Who knows Ireland might even get to celebrate this important European date?
This year, the sixth edition of the European Maritime Day will be held on another European island, in Malta in the city of Valletta.
It is organised by the European Commission (DG for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries) in partnership with the Maltese Ministry for the Economy, Investment and Small Business, and the Maltese Ministry for Tourism. The seas and oceans, and the opportunities they offer, will be at the heart of discussions. There will be high-level political debates as well as more practical exchanges between maritime stakeholders. Thoughts, ideas and new concepts will be devised during the Conference. Lets hope the third biggest sea territory in Europe gets a mention.

When Google unveiled its ‘L Developer Preview‘ for Android yesterday, it did so alongside a new “visual language” called Material Design. The vibrant aesthetic will be rolled out across all of Google's platforms, including Chrome OS and the Web, creating a unified look that binds all of its products together.
The flat design throws in splashes of bright color to reflect a lightweight, welcoming look. Animations have been tweaked to make the experience more playful, while ensuring the maximum amount of content is always visible.
Over on Google+, the company has released some artwork for a printed kit given to I/O attendees. The featured postcards are not only beautiful, but feature small captions that explain the principles behind the new design language.
Google offers the following introduction:
“Design is the art of considered creation. Our goal is to satisfy the diverse spectrum of human needs. As those needs evolve, so too must our designs, practices, and philosophies.
We challenged ourselves to create a visual language for our users that synthesizes the classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science.
This is Material Design.”
1: Material is the metaphor A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion. Our material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by our study of paper and ink, yet open to imagination and magic.
2: Surfaces are intuitive and natural Surfaces and edges provide visual cues that are grounded in our experience of reality. The use of familiar tactile attributes speaks to primal parts of our brains and helps us quickly understand affordances.
3: Dimensionality affords interaction The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects interact. Realistic lighting shows seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.
4: One adaptive design A single underlying design system organizes interactions and space. Each device reflects a different view of the same underlying system. Each view is tailored to the size and interaction appropriate for that device. Colors, iconography, hierarchy, and spatial relationships remain constant.
5: Content is bold, graphic, and intentional Bold design creates hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge-to-edge imagery, large-scale typography, and intentional white space create immersion and clarity.
6: Color, surface, and iconography emphasize actions User action is the essence of experience design. The primary actions are inflection points that transform the whole design. Their emphasis makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides waypoints for the user.
7: Users initiate change Changes in the interface derive their energy from user actions. Motion that cascades from touch respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover.
8: Animation is choreographed on a shared stage All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.
9: Motion provides meaning Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efficient yet coherent.

Cincinnati Reds starting pitcher Raisel Iglesias (26) laughs in the dugout during the bottom of the second inning of the MLB Spring Training game between the Cleveland Indians and the Cincinnati Reds at Goodyear Ballpark in Goodyear, Ariz., on Wednesday, March 2, 2016. The Reds and Indians tied, 4-4. (Photo: The Enquirer/Sam Greene)
GOODYEAR, Ariz. — Raisel Iglesias' smile needed no interpreter.
The Reds' right-hander sat at his locker at the Reds' spring training home Tuesday and watched ESPN's coverage of the Tampa Bay Rays in Havana, Cuba. His eyes hardly looked down at the iPhone in his hand, instead he stared at the TV with a smile on his face.
“I believe this is something incredible happening today,” he said when Tomas Vera, a Reds athletic trainer, did interpret. “It's good for the people from Cuba as well as the same players that are going to be a part of the game today and the players that are here in this country, for us, it is something incredible. It's something beautiful. I'd love to be a part of that now.”
Iglesias, 26, hasn't seen his father since he left Cuba in 2013. He established residency in Haiti, signed with the Reds in 2014 and made his professional and big-league debuts in 2015. One of three Cubans on last year's team, he is now the lone Cuban on the Reds' big-league roster following the trade of Aroldis Chapman and Brayan Pena's departure via free agency.
Pena was one of eight big leaguers to visit Cuba in December as part of a contingency sent by Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players' Association. That is a trip Iglesias hopes to make someday.
“Going back to your homeland and play against the national team of Cuba, it would be something incredible,” Iglesias said, according to Vera. “It is something that players like me would love to be part of the national team or play against the national team.”
Iglesias played for the Cuban national team in the 2013 World Baseball Classic and also played for Isla de la Juventud in Cuba's Serie Nacional.
Iglesias holds onto hope that he can once again play for the Cuban national team, a dream that seemed nearly impossible when he left the island in 2013, but is closer to a reality today, especially with a Major League team playing in Cuba and the President of the United States also in Havana.
As the Rays played the Cuban national team on Tuesday, Iglesias was more familiar with the Cuban team that the Rays. He said he's played either with or against most of the players on the Cuban national team. He's also kept in touch with most of his friends on those teams when they travel outside of Cuba.
“When they come to other countries, they have access to the internet, so we have the opportunity to talk through Facebook, Instagram and all that,” Iglesias said, according to Veras. “I have a really good relationship with all the guys on the team. They're really good people.”
The Reds have a long history with Cuban players, dating back to 1911 when Rafael Almeida and Armando Marsans played in Cincinnati. But the team's most visible link to Cuba is Hall of Famer Tony Perez, whose son Eduardo was part of the ESPN coverage of Tuesday's game in Havana. Because of the connection to the Reds, Iglesias has gotten to know the entire Perez family.
Last year, the elder Perez was honored with a statue outside Great American Ball Park and Iglesias said he got to sit down and talk with him for about an hour.
“He's a great person, a great player,” Iglesias said, according to Vera. “In Cuba, you know who he is. When you achieve that glory in the sport, you're always going to be recognized — everyone is going to know who you are.”
Iglesias, of course, went about his regular business of getting ready for the Major League Baseball season on Tuesday, but admitted he'd drop in and check out a TV as much as he could to get a glimpse of his home — a place he hasn't seen in years — with hopes of returning sometime soon.
“The little I will be able to see, I'll enjoy,” Iglesias said, according to Vera. “I think it's going to be a beautiful game."

Thousands of Palestinian refugees have been forced to flee a camp in the Syrian port of Latakia amid shelling by government troops, the UN says.
A spokesman for the United Nations Relief and Works agency (Unrwa) told the BBC that more than 5,000 of the 10,000 refugees were on the move.
He said at least four people had died, urging immediate access to the site.
Some 30 people have reportedly died in Latakia in a three-day military attack. Syria says it is tackling gangs.
On Monday, there were also reports of a clampdown in the capital Damascus, with people being arrested randomly in the Jobar district.

Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu warned Syria that military operations against protesters must stop "immediately and unconditionally".
Ankara, a former close ally of Damascus, has been increasingly frustrated with its crackdown of the unrest.
The Palestinian authorities urged the Syrian government to safeguard the lives of Palestinian refugees.
In Washington, White House spokesman John Carney said that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must "cease the systematic violence, mass arrests and the outright murder of his own people."
More than 1,700 people have reportedly died and more than 30,000 have been detained in the five-month uprising against President Assad's rule.
'Alarming' situation
On Monday, Unrwa spokesman Christopher Gunness told the BBC that more than 5,000 Palestinian refugees from the camp in Latakia's al-Ramel district and surrounding areas had already fled.
"We have no idea where these people are, we have no idea how many of them are wounded, are dying, are elderly, are women, are children," he said.
Analysis Latakia was one of the cities to be caught up in the revolt soon after it erupted in mid-March. Despite repeated attempts by the regime to stifle defiance, it keeps breaking out. It is a sensitive city. Its population is 600,000 or so, and it has a Sunni Muslim majority, as does the country, but there are also areas dominated by President Assad's minority Alawite community. The current punishment is being meted out to mainly Sunni areas, a fact that could further aggravate sectarian tensions already sensitised by the situation.
He said that at least four people were confirmed dead and nearly 20 were injured.
Mr Gunness added that some refugees had been told by the Syrian government to leave the camp.
He described the situation in the camp as "alarming", calling on Damascus to grant Unwra immediate access to the site to establish "what is going on".
However, similar appeals in the past have been ignored in the past by the Syrian government, the BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says.
Mr Gunness also said that reports from the site suggested that the Syrian military was using tanks and gunboats.
A Syrian military official on Monday denied as "absolutely baseless" reports that gunboats had fired on Latakia, Syria's official Sana news agency reported.
Activists on the ground said later on Monday that Syrian troops had taken control of the Ramel district.
'Terrorist gangs'
The crackdown on Latakia began on Saturday, a day after mass anti-government protests in the city.
On Sunday, activists said Syrian warships had joined the attack, firing shells on the city.
One resident of Ramel told the Associated Press news agency: "We are being targeted from the ground and the sea. The shooting is intense. We cannot go out. They are raiding and breaking into people's homes."
A UK-based Anglican priest who is visiting his family in Latakia said earlier that the atmosphere in the city was extremely tense.
"[On Sunday] you could hear a lot of shooting and bombing from different parts of the city," the Reverend Nadim Nassar told the BBC. "The whole city is now shut... the fear is very high," he said.

Syria's state TV denied any shelling had happened.
It said the security forces were fighting armed gangs who had set up barricades and were shooting from rooftops.
The government said three members of the security forces were killed and 40 wounded in clashes. It interviewed some of the city's residents in other places who called on the army to clear out the "terrorist gangs".
Activists deny that their movement is armed but said at least one officer and a number of soldiers had defected to join the uprising.
Diplomatic pressure
International journalists face severe restrictions in operating in Syria, and it is hard to verify reports.
Meanwhile, newspapers in the region have expressed anger about Arab states' failure to respond to events in Syria.
Latakia has seen many anti-government protests in the past five months.
Syria has come under increased diplomatic pressure in the past week to stop its crackdown on the dissent.
The US has imposed sanctions on Damascus and has said these could be increased, while calling on other countries to follow.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Kuwait have all recalled their ambassadors.
Mr Assad has reiterated promises of political reform, while remaining adamant his government would continue to pursue the "terrorist groups" he has blamed for the unrest.
In recent weeks protesters have also been targeted in Homs, Hama, Deir al-Zour in the east, Deraa in the south and Aleppo and Idlib near Turkey's border.

A Singaporean couple have been jailed for starving their domestic worker from the Philippines, in a case that has shocked the city-state.
The woman lost 20kg (44 lbs) - about 40% of her body weight - while working for them, and was given only bread and instant noodles to eat.
Her employers received jail sentences of three weeks and three months.
Many Singaporeans hire live-in helpers from neighbouring countries, and abuse cases are not uncommon.
Unable to seek help
In the latest case, Filipino domestic worker Thelma Oyasan Gawidan was starved over a period of 15 months, where her weight dropped from 49kg to 29kg.
She testified in court that she was fed only small amounts of food twice a day, and her requests for more food were denied. She was also made to sleep in a storeroom, and allowed to shower only once or twice a week.
Ms Gawidan said she was unable to seek help earlier than her employers had confiscated her mobile phone and passport.
She finally fled in April 2014 and sought help from a migrant workers aid group.
Her employers, finance trader Lim Choon Hong and his wife Chong Sui Foon, pleaded guilty.
They claimed they treated Ms Gawidan the same way they treated themselves, as they ate and showered infrequently due to Chong's "obsessions" with food and cleaning her home. Psychiatrists testified that she had obsessive compulsive disorder and anorexia.
Prosecutors pointed out that the family ate better food and in larger quantities. They sought the maximum jail sentence of one year for the couple.
Lim was jailed for three weeks and fined S$10,000 ($7,175, £5,700), while Chong was jailed for three months.
The case has horrified and outraged Singaporeans, with many on Monday commenting online that the sentences were too lenient.
"Too little... it's too inhumane to starve a person," said one Facebook user.
The BBC's Leisha Chi in Singapore says Ms Gawidan received S$20,000 in compensation, but in today's sentencing the judge's primary concern was whether giving money, be it "one dollar or one million dollars", demonstrated genuine remorse.
Singapore's courts have seen a rising number of cases of domestic helper abuse in recent years.
The city-state has a highly regulated system for employing maids, but activists say not enough is being done to protect migrant workers' rights.
Derrick Lewis is a top-10 ranked UFC heavyweight, one of the funniest characters in the sport, and now the world knows that he's also a top-notch human being.
Hurricane Harvey has left Houston and surrounding areas in turmoil. Many people are trapped and forced to deal with extreme flooding while waiting to be rescued. Lewis, a Houston native, has gone out of his way to help those not only his neighborhood but the entire city.
“I've always been that type of guy that I like to help people more than I like to help myself,” Lewis told MMAjunkie . “And so I just seized the opportunity. The police, they kept getting on the news and saying that they're not going to help no one unless it's a life-or-death situation. Basically, the firefighters said the same thing.”
Lewis is putting action behind those words and has been out in his truck trying to help as many people as he can.
One of the many people he helped happened to be a gentleman that had lost almost all of his possessions, that is except for his Confederate flag.
“I picked up one guy and his family, his wife – he just kept apologizing to me, because all he really had been his clothes, and he wanted to take his Confederate flag,” Lewis said. “He wanted to take that with him, and he just apologized and said, ‘Man, I'll sit in the back of your truck, man. I don't want to have my flag inside of your truck like this.' I said, ‘Man, I'm not worried about that.'
“He's saying, ‘You never know if you ever need someone, so …' – I already knew where he was going with it. I just said, ‘Don't even worry about it. It's OK. I don't care about that.' His wife kept hitting him and saying, ‘You should have just left it.'”
For Lewis and many others around the country, this tragedy is much bigger than a flag or what it represents. The primary goal is to help all people who need assistance, regardless of their personal beliefs, race, religion, etc.
“I don't care about that,” Lewis said. “I live in Texas. It ain't nothing new. I've been living in the South all my life, and it ain't nothing I hadn't seen before or discussed. I don't care about that type of stuff. I just wanted to help him.”
Lewis's platform as a UFC fighter shines a spotlight on his heroic efforts, but there are many others in Texas and Louisiana doing the same for their neighbors and statesmen.
It's important that these stories get the recognition they deserve and others are inspired to help in any way possible.

A 28-year-old Hampden man likely sitting in a cell in Riker's Island at this very moment needs a new attorney, according to his now-former attorney.
James Harris Jackson, the accused murderer who told police he traveled up to New York last month with the intention of killing black men, was set to be arraigned in Manhattan yesterday, per DNAinfo New York. However, the judge in his case rescheduled the hearing to tomorrow after learning that would be Jackson's attorney's final day representing his client.
“Whether they have the funds or not, I'm not sure, but I can say that Mr. Jackson is 28 years old, he's his own financial entity, and his parents are not going to pay for this,” his attorney reportedly told the judge.
Jackson then revealed to the judge that he wouldn't be able to hire a lawyer and had no family or friends to assist with getting him one. The court now plans to assign him a public defender for his arraignment.
Jackson's family wouldn't comment publicly, but their decision could very well be tied to the nature of the crime he's allegedly committed. About two weeks ago, police say Jackson took out a sword he brought with him on a bus to New York and prowled the streets of Midtown before stabbing 66-year-old Timothy Caughman to death on the sidewalk.
Several days later, Jackson turned himself in to police. He said he was planning to kill more black men, who he blamed for dating white women, and that Caughman's murder was only a “practice run” for other killings.
Jackson now faces charges of murder as an act of terrorism, murder as a hate crime and criminal possession of a weapon.
The crime shook people everywhere, particularly in Jackson's home city. The world quickly learned he grew up just outside Baltimore and was living in a Hampden row house before he traveled north to murder black men.
Some other news that became public knowledge: Jackson is an alum of the Friends School in North Baltimore, which sent out a letter to alumni distancing itself from the white supremacist. After graduating from there, Jackson served for three years in the U.S. Army, including multiple tours in Afghanistan.
Evidently, the crime was also enough to shake his family. Barring any pro bono help from a private attorney, Jackson will watch a public defender argue his case before a judge in Manhattan Supreme Court.
Not a week after the horrendous attack that occurred in the French city of Nice, the French Air Force, a member of the anti-ISIS coalition, escalated its bombing of ISIS-held territory.
The retaliatory bombing campaign resulted in a high civilian casualty count in the densely populated Manbij. Lower estimates put the civilian victim numbers at a 100+ while higher estimates provided by local sources put the number at 300, most of whom were women and children.
While civilian losses are not foreign to urban wars, the French Air Force is not foreign to attacks seemingly vengeful in nature. Following the horrific ISIS-claimed attacks in Paris, the French Air Force bombed a school in Iraq's Nineveh massacring 36 children, local sources said.
On a separate note, the French Foreign Minister recently expressed worries about the Syrian Army sieging the civilian population of east Aleppo where a jihadist faction under the umbrella of the western-backed Free Syrian Army gruesomely beheaded a child today, accusing him of collaborating with the Syrian government.
Below are pictures of the horrific scene in Manbij:

It's been a while since a reporter has called to ask if I'm worried that Amazon reader reviews spell the death of my own livelihood as a critic. That used to happen all the time. Over the past 20 years that I've been at this job, professional book reviewers have turned out to be an endangered species, but for reasons having little to do with opinion-dispensing customers on Amazon or Goodreads. (Blame the economics of newspaper publishing!) So I've had few occasions of late to trot out my handful of stock quotes about the very different purposes served by professional and amateur reviews.
Still, there are plenty of reasons to dislike Amazon reviews. Every author has a war story about absurd one-star reviews written by dolts complaining that the shipping package was torn or ranting that the Kindle version ought to be priced lower. Even when these grousers stay on point, customer reviews sometimes seethe with inexplicable contempt. The literary site 0s and 1s runs a regular feature, Thick Skin, in which they interview authors about their negative notices; a disproportionate number of particularly withering reviews seem to come from Amazon and Goodreads. “Wow, that's pretty harsh. Ha!” Michelle Gable, author of the best-seller The Paris Apartment, replied when informed of the review that characterized her writing as like “that of someone whose second and very new language is English.” “I do think people are unnecessarily rude on that site.” At a panel a few years back, the distinguished critic Morris Dickstein noted that Amazon reviewers, while occasionally ingenious, were more often “banal, obtuse, and blankly opinionated.”
But here's my semi-shameful secret: I like reader reviews. I often make a point of seeking them out. When reporters used to interview me on the subject, I'd feel obliged to note that you can find reviews on Amazon and (even more commonly) on Goodreads that are as considered, thorough, and well-written as anything that used to appear in your local newspaper. But actually I don't care much about those reviews. I already know how people like me, people who read books professionally and with a particular set of aesthetic values, respond to a text. I go to reader reviews to see how the other half reads.
The great thing about the internet is that it has the potential to expose us to every kind of opinion in the world, and the awful thing is that this abundance mostly leads us to construct comfortable bubbles of self-validating input. Those bubbles resemble nothing so much as the pre-internet literary world, where “everyone” agreed on which books were important and good, and the fierceness of the debates between, say, New Criticism and Structuralism masked just how similarly the combatants thought. (Not to sound like one of them myself, but this is what Freud described as “the narcissism of small differences.”) But if you're willing to escape your bubble, the internet can teach you the infinite variety of ways that a person can experience a book. The novel I regard as brilliant never quite wins the audience I feel it deserves, while the one I wave away as mawkishly overwritten strikes the reading public as wonderful. This happened before the internet, of course, but now, thanks to reader reviews, I stand a better chance of finding out why.
Crucially, the internet has made it simply impossible for me to kid myself that there's a widely shared agreement on what constitutes good writing or a good book. This, I realize, will be viewed as the violation of a sacred trust by some of my fellow critics, who see our role as that of knights defending the citadel of Literature from barbarian hordes waving Fifty Shades of Grey. But I can't help it: Not only do I think the citadel can take care of itself, but I always want to know what the barbarians are so worked up about. Besides, some of them are not actually barbarians at all, just tired, overworked women who have finally found a bit of recreational reading that hits the spot. I want to know why: why people devoured The Da Vinci Code by the millions, what they saw in The Help, why they fell for Twilight over hundreds of other vampire romances. True, I seldom end up loving the best-sellers myself, but I always learn something from them. And more often than not, with the help of reader reviews, I'm able to ferret out the source of their appeal.
I'm especially intrigued by reader reviews written by people unfamiliar with the vocabulary of literary criticism. They aim to describe experiences that most of us recognize but that can be hard to articulate, and they have to make up the language for it as they go along. Sometimes they acquit themselves pretty well, as in the following review, of David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas, posted by one Jesse Messerli:
To me it seemed like the author had a few ideas for completely unrelated stories, and because none of them were really that good on their own, he decided to combine them all and try to connect them in some way in order to reveal something about the nature of man. After reading the previous reviews I kept expecting it to get better. I kept waiting for some magical revelation that would make it all worth it. I felt as if I was trudging through piles of garbage in hopes of finding the treasure at the end. However once I got halfway through I find that there is no treasure, but I have to turn around and trudge back out of all the garbage and see if there is treasure back at the start. When I finished that I realized that there is no gold nugget hiding anywhere, just miles of trash.
Chances are, if you've read the very popular Cloud Atlas, you don't agree with Messerli. Still, you've probably felt this way about some other acclaimed book. Few professional critics could get away with such a passionately querulous outburst, not to mention that comparison to trudging through piles of garbage—it's so over the top—and yet isn't that exactly how reading a frustrating book feels? While I enjoyed reading Cloud Atlas myself, my heart goes out to Messerli. I've been there, pal.
In perusing reader reviews over the years, I've noticed two words cropping up approvingly again and again, words that rarely appear in professional reviews: “fast” and “flow.” These, I've concluded, refer to much the same quality, something that violently disgusts my most discriminating literary friends: cliché. A “fast read” is a book that “flows,” in prose that calls no attention to itself by virtue of being utterly familiar. You can swallow it in huge gulps and finish in a few hours, if you're not too picky. Eventually, I'd discover C.S. Lewis' astute explanation of the appeal of clichés for readers who consume books solely for their diverting plots. They like this kind of writing, he writes,
… because it is immediately recognizable. “My blood ran cold” is a hieroglyph of fear. Any attempt, such as a great writer might make, to render this fear concrete in its full particularity, is doubly a chokepear to the unliterary reader. For it offers him what he doesn't want, and offers it only on the condition of his giving to the words a kind and degree of attention which he does not intend to give. It is like trying to sell him something he has no use for at a price he does not wish to pay.
“The story flowed effortlessly and keep [sic] the interest going,” wrote Martha Silcox of Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code, a book whose hackneyed prose makes me grind my teeth. Fiction that flows never calls upon its readers to slow down and contemplate or admire any of its parts. It also doesn't feature narrative gaps that oblige the reader to puzzle out what's going on. When reader reviewers dislike unconventionally structured novels like Cloud Atlas or A Visit from the Goon Squad, they typically complain that the book is “disjointed.” On the other hand, the fastest-selling novel for adults ever published, Paula Hawken's The Girl on the Train, has sold over 3 million copies by not taxing its readers overmuch in this department. I found it uninspired, but Amazon reviewer Kcorn declared it a “stunner”: “Chapters alternate between the first person point of view of each woman. This isn't at all confusing and everything flows together seamlessly.”
I've learned to accept that a good number of the books I adore are in some part simply unintelligible to many readers. Sarah Waters' The Little Stranger, a ghost story narrated by a doctor obsessed with the local stately home and the decaying upper-class family that possesses it, is one of my recent favorites. Reader review after reader review complains that “nothing happens” in The Little Stranger, which is manifestly untrue. This dissonance, however, illustrates something important about how plots work.
The lament that “nothing happens” in a novel often means that the main character or characters don't drive the novel's action or events; things happen, but they happen to the characters rather than being caused by them. People want to read about characters they like and identify with, which often means characters who take charge of their destinies instead of passively moping around being “whiny” (another common complaint). Unlikable characters take a close second place to boredom (“I just couldn't get into it”) among the top reasons readers offer for dunning a book with one-star reviews. What literary critics seem to most prize–beautiful sentences–barely seems to count at all. Reader reviews will occasionally praise an author's style, but so many of them describe The Da Vinci Code as “well-written” that to me the phrase has come to seem meaningless.
If I were one of those citadel defenders, I'd probably consider this development dispiriting, or even enraging. Instead, I'm interpreting it as a call to Zen-like acceptance and a clarification of my vocation. It isn't my responsibility to make as many readers as possible think and feel the right way about the right set of authors so that all will be correctly ordered in the literary pantheon. Rather, my job is to give the best possible account of how I think and feel about the books I read, and then hope that my own readers recognize a bit of common ground in what I have to say. That's exactly what Jesse Messerli did instead of just grousing or throwing Cloud Atlas against the wall. It's inevitable that some of them will disagree with me, and every time I come across a reader review that carps about the critics who mendaciously praised the title at hand—often a book that I have in fact touted to the skies—I confess that I wince.
Reader reviewers often take critics to task for praising a “bad book” simply because all of their peers do. Often they seem to believe that critics have conspired to sell the public a bill of goods on hopelessly pretentious writers with nothing of interest to say—or at least to overinflate the work of their own impenetrable darlings. But reader reviews also offer lovely instances of serendipity, when some naïf encounters the work of a much-touted modern master with no notion of the author's renown.
One of my favorite reader reviews ever is for Amazons: An Intimate Memoir by the First Woman Ever to Play in the National Hockey League, by Cleo Birdwell, published in 1980. Literary insiders are aware that Birdwell is a pseudonym of Don DeLillo, the revered postmodern novelist, who apparently wrote this manifestly fictional “memoir” solely for money. Every reviewer comes to a new DeLillo novel knowing that he's thought to be a genius, and once an author's reputation is that exalted, I'll level with you: It can indeed affect your response to the book. But stevie@interport.net had no inkling of this in 1998, when he wrote on Amazons' Amazon page:
a friend of mine found this book in hc for 75 cents in k-mart when i was around 13. she got it for me because i was a huge ny rangers fan & wanted to play hockey. the book turned out to have little to do with hockey, but was truly different & funny in a seinfeld kind of way. there are certain moments & phrases from it that i will never forget. i lent it to one friend who loved it as much as i did, and then another who was not impressed and eventually lost it. i have never ever seen another copy, and it appears that she never published anything else. cleo birdwell, where are you???
I sometimes think that may be the most honest rave Don DeLillo has ever gotten.
So I'll never denounce the abundant proliferation of reader reviews, not even the ones that lambast my own book. One-star reviews testify to a loss of faith, and they wouldn't get written if that faith didn't keep rising up in the first place. Each review represents an instance of someone taking a chance, opening the covers of a book and allowing an author's words into her head with the hope that something magical might result. And I just can't see anything bad about that.

FBI Director James Comey returned to the Hill for a third time Wednesday to defend the integrity of the bureau's investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email setup, and for a third time he encountered dubious Republicans who peppered him with questions to which he didn't always have a satisfying answer.
Via Politico:
“You can call us wrong, but don't call us weasels. We are not weasels,” Comey declared Wednesday at a House Judiciary Committee hearing. “We are honest people and … whether or not you agree with the result, this was done the way you want it to be done.” The normally stoic FBI chief grew emotional and emphatic as he rejected claims from Republican lawmakers that the FBI was essentially in the tank for Clinton when it recommended that neither she nor any of her aides be prosecuted in connection with the presence of classified information on Clinton's private email server. He acknowledged he has “no patience” for such allegations. “I knew there were going to be all kinds of rocks thrown, but this organization and the people who did this are honest, independent people. We do not carry water for one side or the other. That's hard for people to see because so much of our country, we see things through sides,” Comey said. “We are not on anybody's side.”
Congressman Trey Gowdy was one of the Republicans trying to get some answers regarding the integrity of the FBI investigation.
He started off by dryly "acknowledging progress" in the Clinton email matter.
Referring to the House Judiciary Committee hearing, he quipped, "This morning we've had nine straight Democrats talk to the FBI about emails without asking for immunity."
"You and I had a discussion last time about intent," the South Carolina firebrand told Director Comey. "You and I see the statute differently. My opinion doesn't matter -- yours does, you're the head of the bureau...but in my judgement, you read an element into the statute that does not appear on the face of the statute."
The former prosecutor agreed that "intent" is often very hard to prove.
"Very rarely do defendants announce ahead of time, 'I intend to commit this crime on this date. Go ahead and check the code section, I'm gonna do it,'" Gowdy pointed out.
He added, "That rarely happens so you have to prove it by circumstantial evidence."
The bacteria in your gut contribute much more to your life than just gas. Changes in the makeup of the digestive microbiome have been linked to obesity, as some bacteria seem to spur the body to store more fat. And just as fecal transplants can restore the balance of bacterial populations ravaged by antibiotic use and Clostridium difficile infection (often referred to as "C. diff"), fecal transplants might be able to balance the digestive systems of obese individuals.
Scientists have already tried this out on rodents, but this year, they'll test it out on humans, too. A randomized, controlled clinical trial conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital will test how capsules of freeze-dried poop (donated by healthy, lean individuals) can affect the weights of people with obesity.
Patients will begin receiving six weeks of poop pills starting in a few months, after which the researchers will track their weight for at least a year.
Scientists are just beginning to understand the outsized role the microbiome plays in our health (both mental and physical), but how exactly different bacterial colonies affect us is still something of a mystery. This study should be able to provide unique insights into how our gut bacteria influence our weight, and whether those bacterial colonies can be repopulated with healthier species.

In the latest economic indicator that casts Wisconsin in a negative light, the Badger State ranks 49th in the nation in the most recent index from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
"Wisconsin clearly is not leading the recovery," said William Delwiche, an economist in Milwaukee at Robert W. Baird & Co.
The Philadelphia Fed data is from its monthly state-by-state index of leading economic growth indicators, and is meant to predict how the state's economy will grow in the next six months.
The 50-state Leading Index report for April showed only five states with contraction, assigning Wisconsin an index rank of -0.74%. Wyoming, with a rank of -1.29%, is the only state with a lower index.
Economists cautioned against reading too much into a single month's data.
And the Philadelphia Fed's report is imperfect. Among the multiple variables used to compile the leading index, a significant component is the monthly state employment report, which is prone to heavy revisions. That's because the government bases its monthly findings on a survey of only about 3% of the state's employers. That creates a wide margin of error when they are extrapolated statewide.
The Philadelphia Fed tries to compensate by factoring other data into its index, including average hours worked in manufacturing; the state unemployment rate; wage and salary trends; housing permits; and state initial unemployment insurance claims.
Regardless, the Leading Index is also the most recent report that suggests that Wisconsin is struggling in comparison with other states.
The most accurate reading of the state's employment trends show Wisconsin ranks at No. 44 in private-sector job creation in the most recent 12-month period. In the same time frame, also using accurate data, Wisconsin ranks as the nation's fifth worst in terms of the erosion in private-sector wages, in which the state's 2.2% decline is twice the rate of the national 1.1% average.
Even in a slow recovery, Wisconsin has been on the caboose. Few if any economists appear to have pinpointed the exact reasons, which has opened the issue to political posturing over economic policy from both sides.
Most economists point to the state's preponderance of manufacturing industries, which face strong foreign competition and have been slow to reinvent themselves.
"The details that you need on a state level to pinpoint those factors is not available in any real time analysis," said Delwiche at Baird.

Reuben Jones, a 3 star Strong Side Defensive End from Lake Gibson HS in Lakeland, Florida becomes the 14th verbal for the Huskers on Saturday.
Jones, who just visited Michigan State last weekend, visited Lincoln back on September 20th. He also had offers from West Virginia, Duke, Central Florida in the litany of over 20 offers.
Jones and Nebraska was a match made. Both entities really enjoyed his visit back in September, and Rick Kaczenski finished the deal with a verbal this afternoon.
With the 14th current verbal, Nebraska is 35th in the 247 National Rankings, as well as 5th in the Big Ten Conference.
in part 1 of this series, i covered the basics for how to interface with a vehicle bus using an inexpensive USB or Bluetooth ELM327-based scan tool. in part 2 below, i'll go over how to actually use that hardware interface to collect and analyze data with the intention of discovering how to interact with the vehicle in some specific way.
for my own first project, i wanted to know how to intercept the steering wheel radio remote-control button press events. i replaced my factory radio with a Motorola Xoom 10″ Android tablet in order to have a bigger and better GPS (and OBDII app, and better entertainment options, etc). however, touching the screen precisely while driving can be difficult (especially when bouncing around off-road). hence why i wanted the factory steering wheel buttons to still control volume, track, play/pause, etc. i'll use this goal as an example to walk through navigating the bus data.
source code for the above Android app is available on my GitHub:
http://github.com/theksmith/Steering-Wheel-Interface
what you'll need
patience!
a working vehicle bus hardware interface (the scan tool, see part 1)
laptop or tablet with serial terminal application capable of logging to a file
Microsoft Excel (or Apple Numbers, a Google Docs spreadsheet, MS Access, etc.)
task 1: get a baseline
the first task is to gather some baseline data – i.e. what msgs are flying around the bus when you are NOT doing whatever particular interaction you are looking to find the msg for. i tested and found that with the vehicle not running, i could still use the steering wheel buttons to control the radio. that made things a little simpler since i would be able to gather all my sample data with the engine off and the key in “run” (there are way less msgs on the bus when the vehicle is not running).
issue the following commands (one at a time): ATL1 , ATH1 , ATS1 , ATAL
, , , be sure your serial terminal app is set to log to a text file.
issue ATMA to have the scan tool start reporting all of the bus msgs it sees.
to have the scan tool start reporting all of the bus msgs it sees. just press enter after a minute to stop the stream of data.
task 2: log data from the event/interaction in question
the next task is to log the bus msgs when the action you are looking for occurs. this could be when something like when the radio changes tracks, when you press the sunroof close button, etc. i wanted to know the msg for each steering wheel button. i did a data collection run for each of the 6 buttons separately. for each run, i would press the same button 5 times, trying to space the presses evenly about 1 second apart. i wanted to create some sort of pattern that would hopefully stand out in the data stream.
repeat the steps from the previous task, while causing the event in question (or allowing it to happen if you have no control over it).
task 3: analyze the data
now you're ready to analyze the data you collected in order to find just the bus msgs you care about. i used Excel, but you could go with any spreadsheet or database tool that you're familiar with. the complete MS Excel spreadsheet for all the examples below can be downloaded here: 2003WJ-PCIBus-SWButtonData.xls
paste the data from each of your baseline/test runs into separate sheets of the spreadsheet. all the bus msgs should be in the first column. add a column header called “msg“.
on the sheet with the baseline data, add a second column with the header “count“. just fill this column with a “1” for every row.
still on the baseline data sheet, create a pivot table that sums the count for each msg. this is just an easy way to give you a list of distinct msgs.
now go to the sheet with your first sample data run. again use “msg” for the first column header and create a second column filled with 1's called “count“.
for the third column add the header “not in baseline“. for the value of every row, specify a function that places the msg from the first column into this column ONLY if that msg is not in the baseline list. the function might look something like this (my baseline data pivot table is in the sheet named “baseline”, on column “D”):
=IF(ISNA(MATCH(A2,baseline!D:D,0)), A2, "")
you should end up with something like this, where the third column is a bunch of blank cells with only a few having msgs in them:
now create another pivot table similar to the previous. however, for this sample run sheet, use the “not in baseline” and “count” columns. this give you a list of distinct bus msgs that occurred during your test that were NOT duplicates of msgs from the baseline run. it also tells you how many times the msg occurred. you've basically removed the background noise from your data sample. if you're after something really simple, this might be nearly the end of your journey. for my project, i needed to compare several of the buttons to really understand what was going on.
in the previous img, notice i had several distinct bus msgs that were not in my baseline. i had pressed the “up” button on the right side of the steering wheel 5 times for this test run, yet none of the distinct “not-in-baseline” msgs happened exactly 5 times! so i went ahead and repeated these steps for the other 2 buttons on the right side. below are the pivot tables i generated from each of the test runs.
now for some basic deductive reasoning and a little intuition. above i've highlighted in red all of the msgs that occurred at least 5 times – i knew that i definitely pressed the buttons distinctly and hard enough that they should have registered for each press, but perhaps they were sending multiple msgs if i held them down just a bit too long? next i crossed out any msgs duplicated between test runs (the 3 different buttons can't be producing the exact same msg).
this left me with one unique msg to look at in 2 of the runs, and 2 unique msgs in the other run. however with this little data left, it was easy to spot a pattern – all 3 runs had a msg that was sent to bus ID 11. i guessed that 11 must be the radio's ID, and the 3 distinct msgs sent it must be my 3 buttons on the right side of the steering wheel.
task 4: test your hypothesis
you might next want to do a confirmation test, monitoring only the ID that you believe is sending the msg ( ATMT# ), or only the ID that the msg is destined for ( ATMR# ).
based on the deductions above, i thought i had the right 3 bus msgs. but why didn't they occur exactly the number of times i pressed the buttons? i decided to perform another test, but only monitor ID 11 (the radio). hopefully my sample data would be small enough to look at directly and spot a pattern. again i tested each button separately, this time issuing the command ATMR11 to only see msgs destined for the radio. i pressed each button 5 times again, about a second apart. this time i was extremely deliberate and consistent in how i pressed each button. check out the results:
i think what is happening is a side-effect of mechanical switches known as contact bounce or chatter. i later saw that holding down a switch sends regular timed repeats of the msg, whereas a quick press can send from 1 to 3 msgs in rapid succession. this reinforces my suspicion of bounce.
another way to test your conclusions is to send the msg into the bus and physically verify the vehicle responds as expected. this would work for actions like locking/unlocking the doors, etc. i tried to replicate the “up” button on the right side of the steering wheel. if i was sending the right msg, then i would hear the radio increase volume (and see the display indicate the new level). the “up” button msg that i had monitored was 3D 11 04 00 C3 , so i used the the command ATSH 3D 11 04 and then issued 00 (the C3 checksum will be generated by the ELM327 automaticly). sure enough, it worked!
for all of the examples so far i've been working with the SAE J1850 type bus. the msg structure and sample commands should work with most other protocols except CAN-Bus. you may have already inferred part of the msg structure:
3 byte headers + up to 7 data bytes + checksum
the ELM327 reports the msgs in hex, so they look like this (where PP = priority, RR = receiver ID, TT = transmitter ID, DD = data, CC = checksum):
PP RR TT DD DD DD DD DD CC
the msg structure for CAN is just a bit different, and the ELM327 has an entire set of commands specifically for working that protocol. check out the datasheet for complete info on msg structures and all the possible commands.

conclusions
you've likely surmised that vehicle bus hacking can prove non-trivial. it could be much more complex than my little example. i've read that some manufactures encode longer data across multiple standard msgs using custom schemes. deciphering something like that might be impractical. deciphering constantly changing data from a running vehicle is also challenging.
there are professional data collection and analysis tools/software, but you could also write your own. creating a simple application that time-stamps each msg in the log file would be a good start to help find patterns. adding the capability to graph msg frequency would be useful as well.
i came away from this project frustrated that the majority of data moving about in our vehicles is proprietary. it's just another example of how society is moving away from a fix-it culture. if this type of information remains confidential, there is no hope of an individual or small repair shop fixing certain types of vehicle problems. we're not far from a future where cars are as throw-away as iPads. one day i'll have a Jeep that has to go to the Fiat/Chrysler Genius Bar. there i'll find out that repairing whatever minor issue it has is too costly because everything is glued together, and that i'm better off buying the new model.
Maj Gogoi has been awarde­d Chief of Army Staff's Commen­dation Card, says army spokes­person­
An Indian army major who tied a Kashmiri youth to the bonnet of a jeep as a ‘human shield' against stone-pelting protesters has bee awarded a military honour, The Times of India reported.
“Major Gogoi has been awarded Chief of Army Staff's Commendation Card for sustained efforts in counter-insurgency operations,” army spokesperson Aman Anand said.
The officer was awarded by Indian Army chief Gen Bipin Rawat during his recent visit to the held Kashmir.
Earlier today, veteran Bollywood actor and lawmaker Paresh Rawal caused outrage after saying author and activist Arundhati Roy should be tied to an army jeep and used as a human shield.

Major Gogoi of the 53 Rashtriya Rifles was in the spotlight after a video, shot during the April 9 Srinagar Lok Sabha by-poll and posted on social media, showed a man tied on the bonnet of an army jeep in Badgam. The video went viral and drew anger and condemnation.
An investigation by the police, which lodged an FIR against the security forces in light of the incident, revealed that Gogoi had tied the man to the jeep's bonnet as a human shield.

A Court of Inquiry instituted against the major has yet to hand in a report on its findings.
Last week, Defence Minister Arun Jaitley had expressed his support for Gogoi's actions and said it was the officer's responsibility to save the lives of those involved in the by-election that day as well as the crowd that had gathered.
Taking notice of the inhuman incident, former Chief Minister of Indian-held Kashmir, Omar Abdullah expressed his shock on Twitter. “This young man was TIED to the front of an army jeep to make sure no stones were thrown at the jeep? This is just so shocking!!!!,” he said while sharing the video:
Here's the video as well. A warning can be heard saying stone pelters will meet this fate. This requires an urgent inquiry & follow up NOW!! pic.twitter.com/qj1rnCVazn — Omar Abdullah (@abdullah_omar) April 14, 2017

If you spend a lot of time in busy U.S. airports, Verizon Wireless (NYSE: VZ) and T-Mobile US (NYSE:TMUS) are likely going to offer you better overall performance and mobile data speeds than AT&T Mobility (NYSE: T) and Sprint (NYSE: S), according to the latest bi-annual report from network testing firm RootMetrics.
In its latest test of airport network performance, the firm used web and app access rates and task success rates as indicators of network reliability. Access rates showed how often the firm was able to connect to a network during web/app testing, while task success rates showed how often RootMetrics was able to complete a web/app task. The firm noted that a threshold of 97 percent success "is a high bar and reflects performance that would pose little to no noticeable disruptions to everyday activity." RootMetrics also measured median downlink and uplink speeds of the carriers. The firm used a 20 Mbps threshold to indicate "lightning-fast download speeds" and 10 Mbps as a measure of excellence for upload speeds.
RootMetrics' report found Verizon in the lead.
With 31 wins, Verizon won the most first-place Airport RootScore awards of any network by far in the second half of 2014. According to the report, Verizon fell below 97 percent in web/app access success at only two airports and below 97 percent in web/app task success at only five airports. It had by far the most airports with median download speeds of 20 Mbps or higher and median upload speeds of 10 Mbps.
T-Mobile, which has made significant improvements to its LTE coverage and speed in major metro areas, came in second with 17 wins or ties. "T-Mobile offered excellent data performance at many of the airports we tested," RootMetrics noted. "T-Mobile beat all other networks in number of airports with task success rates of 97% or above." The carrier also performed well in median upload speeds, coming in second only to Verizon in the number of airports with median upload speeds of 10 Mbps or more. However, it came in third in the number of airports with task access rates at the 97 percent threshold as well as the number of airports with median download speeds of 20 Mbps or more.
AT&T fell behind T-Mobile in the tally of Airport RootScore awards, with 10, and its median upload speed and web/app task success rate results were possible factors in the carrier slipping. However, AT&T did quite well in download speeds, second only to Verizon in the number of airports with median download speeds of at least 20 Mbps. Further, AT&T was also second only to Verizon in the number of airports with web/app access success rates of 97 percent or above.
Sprint clearly has some catching up to do in terms of its performance at airports. Although the company expanded LTE coverage to 260 million POPs by the end of 2014, it is only using 5x5 MHz spectrum blocks for its 1900 MHz LTE network, which inhibits its speeds. The company also deployed its faster 2.5 GHz TD-LTE network to more than 100 million POPs by the end of 2014. RootMetrics said Sprint had the lowest number of airports with web/app access and task success rates above 97 percent. There was only one airport where Sprint provided median download speeds above 20 Mbps or median upload speeds above 10 Mbps.
In terms of how individual airports fared, Memphis International, Pittsburgh International, Chicago's O'Hare International, Southwest Florida International in Ft. Meyers, Fla., and Dallas' Love Field were ranked the highest in terms of overall performance. San Diego International Airport was the worst-performing airport, according to RootMetrics.

The Americans most inclined to tap government benefits and to think of welfare as a good thing are also the least likely to participate in the democratic process.
In a recent New York Times column, Alec MacGillis asks why so many poor Americans who benefit from welfare have lately been voting for Republican candidates who want to curtail those programs. MacGillis is especially curious about poor whites in former Democratic strongholds like Kentucky, a state that in November replaced Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear with Tea Party Republican Matt Bevin.
A flashpoint in that election was Obamacare, which Beshear had embraced and defended, establishing one of the country's more successful health insurance exchanges, Kynect, and expanding Medicaid. As a result, Kentucky saw the country's largest decrease in the number of uninsured, with some of the state's poorest residents gaining health coverage.
Bevin, by contrast, vowed to repeal the Medicaid expansion and shut down the state exchange. Since winning the election he's tempered his rhetoric somewhat but remains committed to reducing the Medicaid rolls, which have increased by more than 400,000 with the program's expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Nevertheless, many of the state's poorest areas voted for him—like Pike County in Kentucky's remote eastern coal country, a former Democratic bastion, which went for Bevin by 55 percent.
MacGillis also points to the re-election last year of Maine's governor, Paul LePage, who has long pushed for more restrictions on welfare programs in a state where nearly 15 percent of residents are on food stamps—third highest in the country. LePage won the governor's mansion in 2010 by running on an anti-welfare platform, and the 2014 election was in part a referendum on his outspoken anti-welfare record. In a 2012 speech to Maine's Republican Party LePage was blunt, calling Maine a “sinking welfare state” and saying, “To all you able-bodied people out there, get off the couch and get yourself a job.”
His Democratic opponent, Rep. Mike Michaud, attacked him on the issue, saying LePage simply wanted to kick people off public assistance without giving them a chance to improve their lot. It didn't work. LePage won re-election by nearly five points, and as Bevin did in Kentucky, he carried parts of his state that most rely on welfare programs.
Yes, Working People Despise Freeloaders
How can this be? “The temptation for coastal liberals is to shake their heads over those godforsaken white-working class provincials who are voting against their interests,” writes MacGillis, alluding to Thomas Frank's 2004 thesis in “What's The Matter With Kansas.”
Voters who have managed to get by without welfare, or have worked their way off it, resent those who languish on the dole.
Frank argued that many low-income voters are distracted by social issues like abortion and gun control, and, poor saps, wind up voting against their own best economic interests. MacGillis' take is more or less an update on Frank's argument, but with two additional, albeit somewhat obvious, insights: first, those slightly higher on the income ladder increasingly resent those beneath them, and second, those most dependent on welfare are increasingly disengaged from politics—many of them don't even bother to vote.
The first point is a perfectly understandable reaction to a post-recovery economy in which wages are stagnant even as the number of able-bodied, working-age adults on welfare increases (thanks in part to the Obama administration allowing states to waive work requirements for SNAP, the federal food stamp program). Rather than being distracted by social issues, writes MacGillis, “these voters are consciously opting against a Democratic economic agenda that they see as bad for them and good for other people—specifically, those undeserving benefit-recipients who live nearby.”
To call redistributive programs like Obamacare or SNAP an “economic agenda” is a stretch, but the point stands: voters who have managed to get by without welfare, or have worked their way off it, resent those who languish on the dole. Such voters, as we've seen, are increasingly apt to express that resentment by voting against candidates that defend progressive government schemes.
Welfare Saps People's Will to Govern Themselves
The partisan outcome, however, is really a second-order effect of the ideological point that MacGillis is making, whether he realizes it or not, about declining voter participation: the pervasive administrative state erodes democratic self-governance.
Alexis de Tocqueville noted something similar back in the 1830s, observing the effects of radical equality in the young American republic.
That MacGillis should explore these phenomena in a rehash of Frank's theory is a testament to the durability of an old idea. Alexis de Tocqueville noted something similar back in the 1830s, observing the effects of radical equality in the young American republic. Of the mild-mannered, earnest Americans the French statesman encountered, he observed: “I have no fear that they will meet with tyrants in their rulers, but rather with guardians.” It would be too much, he wrote, to call “the species of oppression by which democratic nations are menaced” by the old names of tyranny or despotism.
The oppression Tocqueville feared for America was much milder than that. He was thinking of a government that acts toward its citizens the way a doting parent does to a child, one that “takes upon itself alone to secure their gratifications and to watch over their fate”—not to prepare them for manhood, or independence, but “to keep them in perpetual childhood.”
A government like that would eventually sap a people's capacity, and even their desire, for self-government: “For their happiness such a government willingly labors, but it chooses to be the sole agent and the only arbiter of that happiness; it provides for their security, foresees and supplies their necessities, facilitates their pleasures, manages their principal concerns, directs their industry, regulates the descent of property, and subdivides their inheritances: what remains, but to spare them all the care of thinking and all the trouble of living?”
And here we are: those Americans most inclined to avail themselves of government benefits—and to think of welfare as a beneficial thing in itself—are also the least likely to participate in the democratic process. MacGillis notes correctly that voter participation in the poorest areas of country has been declining for years. The solution for Democrats, he argues, “means redoubling efforts to mobilize the people who benefit from the programs,” under the assumption that those who benefit from such programs will support politicians who champion them.
Big Government Abandons People's Highest Aspirations
Perhaps they will, but it doesn't seem to occur to MacGillis that what some welfare beneficiaries might want more than a government handout is a job, and that candidates who speak to those aspirations might have more appeal than the ones who offer welfare—or welfare disguised as economic stimulus.
It doesn't seem to occur to MacGillis that what some welfare beneficiaries might want more than a government handout is a job.
Consider the coal industry. At no point does MacGillis question whether there might be a connection between the decline of Kentucky's coal industry and the Obama administration's draconian Environmental Protection Agency regulations under the Clean Power Plan. If coal country is abandoning candidates who champion progressive, big-government solutions, perhaps it's because many ex-miners feel they were abandoned by big government first.
It shouldn't be that hard to imagine why a miner deprived of his work because of government regulations should in turn resent welfare from that same government—even if, at the end of the day, he begrudgingly accepts public assistance out of sheer necessity.
Likewise, it shouldn't be that hard to imagine why another man might gladly accept the same assistance and simply not work for as long as possible. Human nature can equally account for both responses, and it's a tribute to the intellectual isolation of our elites that such things don't even occur to them. As Kevin Williamson has noted, much of the debate between conservatives and liberals over welfare has to with “whether we are going to think of poor people as pets.”
The likes of MacGillis or Frank or Paul Krugman look upon the non-voting poor of Appalachia and think more must be done for them, if not in direct welfare payments then in some other form of “economic opportunity” created on their behalf. This is a failure of imagination that Tocqueville, for one, didn't share. He knew that when a government treats its people like pets, “it every day renders the exercise of the free agency of man less useful and less frequent; it circumscribes the will within a narrower range and gradually robs a man of all the uses of himself.” No wonder they don't vote.

The Illini Union Board is hosting Shaun King, a civil rights activist and political commentator, to speak about civil rights issues on March 9 at 7 p.m.
Senior justice writer at New York Daily News, King often discusses issues such as police brutality, mass incarceration and discrimination in the United States.
“The Illini Union Board has a semester-long lectures program that tries to bring lecturers that we feel the student body can identify with and will make our campus more inclusive, welcoming and maybe even open eyes for some people who might not be as in the know on some topics,” said Jenna Wicks, program director for the Illini Union Board.
Last month, the Union hosted Miss America 2014, this month, they are hosting Shaun King and next month another speaker will be brought in.
“Our students put together a list of potential speakers that they would like to bring to campus. Based on availability and cost, we try to make it happen,” Wicks said. “ We have been working on bringing Shaun King before the semester even started.”
King has been a large contributor to the Black Lives Matter Movement, often focusing on getting attention for little-known instances of racially motivated injustice. He became popular through social media outlets, namely Twitter and Facebook.
“Sometimes controversy isn't a bad thing, and Shaun King does bring up a lot of issues that are controversial,” Wicks said.
Wicks said that being able to talk about controversial topics is important because it gets other people's perspectives to fit into a bigger picture.
“What King does is he brings to light things that are not normally in the light,” Wicks said.
Wicks said that they are expecting a large turnout of around 600 to 800 people for King's lecture.

Residents and elected representatives are up in arms against BMC's apathy after around hundred odd fishes have been found floating dead in the polluted Sion pond during the past two days. The pond had last witnessed a mass fish deaths in 2012 where almost all the fishes in it died.
Former principal scientist at Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), Dr Vinay Deshmukh said that one of the most common reasons for fishes dying in water bodies specially ponds and lakes is due the lack of oxygen. "I have not visited the spot but going by the photographs and information , it clearly seems that the deaths are due to the increase in the organic pollution, which reduces the dissolved oxygen levels. Most of the fishes that are dead are species of cat fish, which are already sensitive," he said stating that the pond water must be getting contaminated with sewage or other pollutants.
Meanwhile BJP councillor of ward 172 Rajshri Shirwadkar expressed concerns over the death of fishes. She said that people immersed floral offerings as well as coconuts in the pond and despite repeated reminders BMC did scant action to save this historic pond. "It was first on Sunday morning that around 40 odd fishes were found dead and floating in the water and similarly around 50 were found on Monday and most of these fishes are fully grown and over 10 to 20 kg," Shirwadkar said adding that the last clean up of the pond was done in around 2011. It has never been cleaned since then despite regular idol immersions happening in the pond.
Deshmukh informed that a pristine fresh water body has around 6ml of oxygen per litre of water and the oxygen level can drop to less than 1ml of oxygen per litre of water in very polluted water. "Due to the pollution the dissolved oxygen reduced and it is lowest during early morning and hence most of the fishes are found dead during early morning period and this phenomenon is quite common during winters," he said adding that some one needs to do a detailed study of the pond its water quality and not simply test the BOD, which might not result in proper results.
Dr MJ Pravin Bhatt who is a priest in the nearby temple was pained by the death of the fishes. He bought an aeration machine to increase the oxygen in the pond. "Its a painful sight to watch these fishes that are dying due to lack of oxygen, hence I decided to buy this machine and installed it," he said.
Assistant Municipal Commissioner of F-North ward, Keshav Ubale said, "I have received a complaint from citizens that few fishes have died in the lake. Following residents complaints the pond water will be tested. We do not have any contractor for the maintenance of the lake, it is a natural body and has aquatic animals like fishes and tortoises."
Why is Mauritania next?
France has been efficiently defending its interests in those countries through cultural and economic power, coupled with dozens of covert actions to overthrow leaders that refused to preserve France's interests. France has used mercenaries, the most famous being Bob Denard, who participated in dozens of attempted coups in Africa and did hundreds of covert actions for various French governments, both left and right wing.
Since the ‘decolonization' era after WW2 , France has interestingly kept close and friendly ties with its former colonies in Africa. France was unable and unwilling to retain strong links with Indochina that was a former French colony, but with Africa it is a different story. Indeed, quickly after the decolonization era, a new word was created “Franceafrique” to designate France's unique relationship with its former African colonies and the Belgian colonies in Africa (the Congo, for example).
France's Ruthless Attitude
France has deployed an unusually ruthless attitude to safeguard its interests in its former colonies and in French-speaking Africa, far from the image of the ‘country of human rights' it likes to present on the international stage.
Still, in the 21st century France's relationship with Francophone African countries has evolved, and the rules of the game have changed. Sarkozy and Hollande, the two latest French presidents, have declared an end to Franceafrique, condemning it as a kind of neocolonialism. But more importantly, China has started to invest heavily in Africa and has been able to significantly reduce France's influence in the region.
Still, France's interests have pushed the successive governments to launch intelligence and military operations on the African continent, notably to counter the Jihadi threat and the continuous rise of Islamists organisations, which threatens to endanger the whole region and have repercussions in Paris, home to a large African community.
Anti-Terror deployment in the Sahel
France launched recently Operation Barkhane and Operation Serval in Mali and in the Sahel Region. France has also been involved in a temporary peace-keeping campaign in the Central African Republic through Operation Sangaris. France is seen as the only strong force that could ensure stability in the region, notably the strategic Sahel Region.
France's role has become ever more important since the latest intervention in Libya, where the dictator Gadhafi was overthrown. The result was a civil war between the different factions in Libya, which most importantly created an influx of both light and heavy weapons in the Sahel regions, arming and reinforcing the Islamist groups in Mali and Algeria. These groups took over an important part of Northern Mali in 2015 and forced the French to intervene to impeach an Islamist takeover of the entire country.
Paris can tolerate a certain level of instability in the Sahel region, but the takeover of an entire country and the fear of an Islamist spillover in the whole region (which is predominantly Muslim) convinced Francois Hollande to intervene.
The past few conflicts in which France intervened often caused a near total collapse of the government and threatened the security of the environment, particularly in the case of its former colonies in west Africa. In this regard, Mauritania will definitely be the location of the next French intervention.
Mauritania : The facts
Mauritania is a weak country that for a long time has used its meager economic resources to buy support for the government in Nouakchott. The country is indeed a Muslim country divided into various tribal factions. The Mauritanian people belong first to their tribal and ethnic group before feeling a national identity. But for the past few years, the country's main resources have been decreasing. More alarmingly, the presidential tribal clan is taking an ever larger share of these resources, endangering the relative tribal peace that has been prevailing over the past years. Therefore, Mauritania's tribal factions, whose support is vital to preserve peace in Mauritania, have become more and more active these past months. There are three tribal factions: the Moors (Bidhan) represent 30% of the Population, the Haratins (40%), and the West Africans (Wolof, Bamara, Soninke) make up the rest.
On top of this, the country's president Mohamed Uld Abdel Aziz, who has been in power since a coup in 2009 (the country has a long history of military coups) recently declared that he will seek a controversial third term in power. If he is serious about running for office again, this could create clashes and widen the gaps between the different tribal groups of the country, potentially bringing political instability and an attempted coup.
In addition to this explosive situation, the current French Operation Serval has pushed all the terrorists out of their safe haven, and many have taken refuge in Mauritania, which is outside the scope of the French Forces' actions.
Sahel: The growing Al-Qaeda threat
Regional terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda (AQIM in the region) have always used the country as a transit zone for their attacks in neighbouring countries, with the current government turning a blind eye to the fact that it has terrorists operating on its soil to strike other countries. These terrorist groups could benefit from Mauritania's lack of leadership and side with the dissatisfied tribal groups, who have the advantage of being Sunni Muslims. The terrorist groups could also ally with other tribal leaders and create an alliance against the President and his clan.
France, whose main interest in the region is stability, could come to the conclusion that Abdel Aziz is a threat to regional security. He made agreements with terrorist groups fighting French forces in Operations Serval. These two factors could push Paris to support a coalition of moderate rebels, with the intelligence and logistics to overthrow the President. Still, if that does not work and that the country plunges into chaos and instability, Paris will probably seek to intervene directly using its forces already present in the Sahel for operation Serval. Other international players, such as the UN or the US, would probably support – as always – a French move in the country to avoid further regional instability. France is seen as and remains the only country with the interest and the ability to perform such a mission.
France is considered as the western country that has the most regional knowledge about Africa and how to undertake military missions there. When Mauritania officially plunges into chaos and becomes a failed state, who do you think will intervene? This situation would probably happen before 2020.
The Christian monk Xanthias once said: "A dog is better than I am, for he has love and does not judge."
You'd be hard pressed to find a group whose members believe more strongly in this than the monks of New Skete, reports The Saturday Early Show. For more than 30 years, they have been showing millions of dog owners that a little divine intervention can be a big blessing.
Visitors to the New Skete Monastery, a mountaintop sanctuary nestled in the hills of upstate New York, retreat into a tranquil world, interrupted only by man's best friend.
Prayer is often put on hold for the monastery's resident majority, German shepherds. For three decades, the monks of New Skete have been breeding and training these animals. While that business provides income, there are spiritual benefits as well.
"The dogs will keep us down to earth, because they have to be walked, they have to be taken out, they have to be fed. It's a good balance for our lives," says Brother Marc, a founding member of New Skete. He has been breeding shepherds there since the beginning.
"The dogs sort of form a pack with us, with all the monks, so it's like one big happy family," he explains. "We all have to learn how to live together, and from the experience of this, we learn the need and the techniques of socialization, which is teaching the dogs from puppyhood on, even adult dogs, how to live with human beings."
Each monk has a four-legged companion: his own roommate, playmate, and dinner mate. While most of the dogs are shepherds, any canine is welcome. The monastery is also a doggy boot camp; $1,000 buys a dog three weeks of personalized training.
These Russian Orthodox monks discovered their second calling by accident. There was no grand plan, just the need for some animal affection in their often isolated lives. Their first German shepherd puppy, Kier, arrived in 1966. When he died, the monks adopted two other pups. Visitors were impressed with the animals and began inquiring about adoption. So, the brothers began studying veterinary medicine and breeding techniques.
"Then," recalls Brother Marc, "eventually some people from the U.S. Customs Service would come and say, 'Can we get some shepherds from you?' And we began working with the different kennels that raise dogs for working with the blind, and it just snowballed."
The monks quickly branched out into training all breeds. They now have two best-selling books, a video and a Web site.
Their mantra: Respect the dog.
Says Brother Christopher, "The dog is not an object, a thing to have. It's, rather, a living being that has the capacity to interact with us in a very wonderful and endearing way."
From birth, the puppies are cuddled to encourage healthy nervous systems. Days after birth, they are put through the thermal stress test. This requires removing then from the warmth of the litter and taking them into a cooler, unfmiliar environment. The monks believe this strengthens the dogs' nervous systems. Along with common commands, basic instruction includes leash training and the importance of body language.
Advises Brother Christopher, "You can't have a successful relationship with a dog if the dog is competing with authority. And, so, we tried to show in both books and our videos how to exercise that leadership in a humane and sensible way."
And Brother Stavros: "Simply make a dog an extension of yourself but learn that it's a being as well. Dogs are, by their domestic nature, good companions, but to bring out the best, you have to respect the dog."
Some New Skete visitors think that respect has possibly gone too far when they see canines in church. But the monks of New Skete wouldn't have it any other way. They see the dogs as their spiritual ambassadors.
But the New Skete shepherds don't come cheap. Puppies sell for $1,300. Even if your wallet can handle it, you'll have to wait a while. The monks can train up to four dogs at once, and they're not accepting any new applications until next March.

Titanfall's Xbox 360 version, originally scheduled to launch on March 25, has been delayed to April 8, the game's maker announced.
According to a post on the game's official page, "we see a few things that can be made even better, so we're giving Bluepoint Games [the studio responsible for Titanfall's Xbox 360 version] a little more time to do that and deliver an epic Titanfall experience for Xbox 360 players.
"We appreciate everyone's patience as we get the last details right," the post added.
The launch date in Europe will now be April 11.
Titanfall launched on Xbox One and Windows PC on March 11. Earlier this month, Vince Zampella, the co-founder of Respawn Entertainment, said the Xbox 360 version of the game was "lagging behind" because of efforts to integrate the day-one patch for the PC and Xbox One versions.
A Cut of Reality: What I Learned While Writing Reality TV
I started working as a writer for reality TV the same week I graduated from my MFA program. It wasn't so different from the kind of writer I was before, with its mixture of observance followed by some kind of assembly, except that the watching was less romantic—I was not sitting in a cozy coffee shop. Instead, for eight hours a day, I sorted through footage of uniformed men and wrote deep-bellied voiceovers full of puns that would make your dad cringe for a show that I will refer to as Rural Cops.
There were parts of the job that came easily to me: the desire to create order in the midst of disorder, for instance. But there were also parts that were new, like how natural a lie can feel when it's coming out of you. I felt a sort of wonder at the fluidity of the transition, how easily I slipped into this new role.
Admittedly, within the genre of reality TV, this story—Rural Cops—was not the most offensive variation on the truth. While what made it onto your screen at home was a better version of what actually happened, eschewing many of the parts that made it human—like aimless driving, fiddling with the radio, giving a speeding ticket—and reordering the best parts to pack the biggest punch, for the most part nobody was telling the cops of Rural Cops what to do or what to say. We just watched.
When I used to share my profession with someone new, I was often greeted with some variation of the question, But if it's reality, what are you writing? Through this, I came to learn something remarkable: Americans still largely trust television. Of course we should trust TV. Or rather: we should trust that television is a trustworthy measure of what Americans want to regard as narratively sound. TV's whole M.O. is reflecting what people want to see, how we make sense of the world. It's a mirror—not a Baroque-style gilded mirror; more like an overlit bathroom mirror in which a shirtless teenager is taking a selfie. But still, a mirror.
Sitting in the cramped quarters of my office, I quickly learned my first lesson in writing reality TV: Imagine the story I wanted to happen, and leave out everything else. While I lacked experience in writing TV, I was also twenty-four and still had faith in my unique perspective, my opinion of how things should be. As a fiction writer, I also understood narrative. The mirror again reflects inwards: we are creatures of habit. We crave narrative to help make sense of the world. If something inexplicable happens to us, we struggle to put it in terms of some kind of causal relationship—x-thing happened, so y-thing was the result. Some days, we might boil down the whole of human experience to this two-sided equation. This kind of thinking may be what prevents us from deleting our exes' phone numbers, or what keeps us in contact with our estranged parents—our innate desire for an answer to a simple question: “Why?” It's also this kind of thinking that makes TV compelling.
An example from the show:
The call comes in on the police radio: There is a wild lynx on the loose in a local neighborhood (remember, this is Rural Cops).
This is what actually happened: The cop drives up to a man, who directs him down the icy road to the family who reported the lynx. Right away, you can see on camera that the lynx appears to be injured in the snow, maybe 100 yards away. The discarded carcass of a half-eaten rabbit is nearby, the snow stained red around it. The lynx isn't moving much. Because it has already wandered too deeply into the neighborhood and because it is fatally injured, it must be put down. The cop gets his rifle, approaches the large cat. A gunshot later, he retrieves it from the snow.
This is the TV version: The cop gets the call. He drives up to a man, who tells him the lynx is nearby. The voiceover surmises the cop is hot on the lynx's trail, so he hunkers down to start searching. The music climbs. As he drives, the voiceover reminds the viewer there are kids in this neighborhood, likely playing outside in the snow right now. The voiceover also reminds the viewer how dangerous lynx are, and explains what they generally look like for those at home who don't know. Insert a soundbite about the possible but not yet realized danger. After a tense search, the cop arrives at the house where the call originated. The lynx doesn't make it on camera yet, but the bloody carcass of the half-eaten rabbit does. The snow blooms red. The voiceover instructs the viewer to note the evidence: the lynx must be close, and who knows, it may still be hungry—because it didn't finish eating. (Note the voiceover does not explicitly say the lynx will attack.) The music crescendos as the camera finally reveals the main event: the lynx, entrenched in white snow.
There is one important change, one made precisely because of our innate desire for neat narrative order. In the unedited version, you can see how the lynx reacts to the man approaching him with a rifle, paws clawing backwards as he tries and fails to escape; on television, the footage is reversed. The lynx claws forward, as if ready to leap. A moment later, the gunshot splits the air in two. You see: x-thing happens, and y-thing is the result.
As a child, I was always looking to the future. I found myself inventing elaborate scenarios featuring myself as an adult, specifically a twenty-four-year-old, an age I settled on because my mother had told me that twenty-four was her best year. When I asked her why, she said she wasn't sure, just that it was “a lucky year.” At twenty-four, my mother had already had her first child, and was also on the cusp of ending her first marriage. It seemed that at twenty-four she had begun to direct the course of her own life again. My own childhood fantasies of what life would be like at twenty-four tended to be more dramatic. In these visions I would be standing on a sandy beach, wrapped in a silk kimono, wearing large sunglasses that covered my entire face. If anyone had asked me why I was standing on that beach, I would have had an answer ready: of course I owned that piece of it, and I also owned the bungalow behind me, where I spent my summers taking photographs for glossy fashion magazines after my divorce (by now I imagined that I too had already loved, and already lost, but had persevered).
At the actual age of twenty-four, the best thing I could say I'd achieved was getting paid to piece together elaborate TV scenarios that stretched the truth as far as they could without technically being untrue. Still, at work I often thought of my old imagined lives from childhood. My bosses, the company's married owners, seemed in some ways the walking embodiment of my former imaginings; the kind of people who impulse-bought cars and boats and puppies and returned them if any of these things leaked too much. Money was in the foreground, background, and middle of all their interactions. I privately referred to the third boss of the managerial trio (not exactly a full partner, but not just an employee) as “the henchman,” not least because he actually looked like a movie villain.
At the office, we were sold on reality TV like a group of hungry Gold Rush miners. There were few people over the age of twenty-five, which was a running joke for us—as in, look at this bunch of kids making TV. It was also a perfect intersection of promise, possibility, and gullibility (not to mention cheap labor). Management often impressed upon us a simple and digestible idea: You just need one pitch, just one that works, and you will make a lot of money.
These are actual show ideas I was involved in pitching:
Meet the Co-Parents: Where raising a family doesn't need to include romance!
Surviving Siberia: Could You Take On the Extreme?
Sew Me the Dress! (About wedding dress seamstresses.)
Deep Sea Underwater Welders—this one didn't even have a title, it just sounded like a promising field.
It's hard not to get caught up in the idea of making lots of money, especially when one is making very little of it. So when “the henchman” sat me down one day and asked me to find “Mormons, but ex-Mormons. Like Mormons Gone Wild,” I did my best. (Note: Breaking Amish was a popular show that year.) Of course, I'm not sure my boss had ever met an ex-Mormon, or understood what it meant to be one. But pitching shows often operated on the same principle as writing for them did—that is, imagine the story you want, and try to make reality fit into it.
It wasn't easy to collect these stories from strangers. My speech was always the same: the show would be about transformation, not exploitation. If I really had to convince someone, I talked about gaining strength from sharing their experience. But as emails flooded my inbox, a sea of confessions too personal to replicate, I began to feel that I was holding something tender in my hands—something that was not supposed to be mine.
Sure enough, the stories and the people we found weren't what they wanted. Too old. Too young. Too boring. The show died before it launched. In the end, my failure to find what they needed was a relief—at least I knew that their stories, intimate as they were, would stay safe where they belonged: with the people who lived them.
On the whole, this was an unhappy time for me. I began and ended a disastrous relationship, was passed over on several new projects, and went almost two years without writing a single word of my own work. In response, I hurt the people I cared about. I cut myself off from many of my friends. I cried until I was not even aware of when I was crying and when I was not, and when I went to the doctor, she only said that I seemed to be a bit depressed and that I should talk to someone. She wrote down a name and number for me, but I was so embarrassed I did not call.
I've been told by some that sadness can be a problem of narrative, the narrative we see in our own lives. One day you own it, the next the plot seems out of your control. Like having too many hands in the pot—everyone else has had their say about your life, and the taste of it all is not what you had planned.
Working late one night against a deadline, “the henchman” poked his head into my office. He leaned against the doorway and said, “I have a job for you.”
It's embarrassing now to think of how my heart leapt.
He said, “I need you to walk on my back.”
You can imagine what I wanted to say. Instead I turned back to my work and said, “I'm not going to walk on your back,” in a tone that maintained this was all a ridiculous joke. I am not going to walk on your back was an assortment of words that certainly sounded like a joke when put together.
He ignored me, complained about his pain, and laid down on his stomach at my feet.
When most women imagine themselves in a moment like this, I think we all see ourselves saying “no.” But when the moment actually comes, sometimes it's messier and more frightening than we imagined. The truth is, I panicked; shrunk down to the size of a pea. And as I took off my shoes, in that moment it felt as though the wide expanse of his back would become the terrain of the rest of my life, the law of a new world. I thought: this is it, from here on out my life will always be like this, ruled by somebody else's demands. It seemed silly that there should be a part of my own story I had no say over, even as I stood above him.
That was not the last night I worked there, but it was the first night I knew with certainty that I had to leave. Every day thereafter I struggled to explain to myself what that night meant. Every day, I searched for things that marked the change that had occurred in me, half-expecting something incredible to happen, like a tornado touching down. But nothing ever came, and the violation, like many worse ones, came and went without note from the rest of the world.
Part of what I want to tell you is what the narrative of a young woman can be like, how a handful of minutes can become the rest of your life with the deceptive ease of a film dissolve. That is how that job appears to me now, a long sequence of cinematic shots. A snowy afternoon dissolves into a sun-kissed meadow; I enter a revolving door at twenty-four and come out older, and with new hair.
Remember: x-thing happens, and y-thing is the result. But that equation doesn't always answer the question, “Why?”
I'm making it sound like there was never anything good about the job, but the truth is there was a great deal of laughter. While anyone who works in television can't deny that it's an example of “low” art, or maybe just the kind of art that tries a little too hard to please, even people who work in reality TV can find pleasure in it. Because in making any kind of art—base though you may consider it—there really is still something undeniable and unquantifiable: the challenge of creating something out of virtually nothing. That is a pleasure of the highest order for people like us.
In the end, what I learned to write reality TV is this: in all this mess, reality shows can hold a certain appeal—which they share with fiction and almost every other kind of narrative we come across. We hope, desperately, to find something relevant to our own lives: some small hint about how to live just a bit better, something to justify our optimism, something to show us we are not alone in what we face. A new story starts in hope and excitement, and when it begins, we see another possibility for change.
When the show I wrote for was eventually canceled, I ended my two-year stint in this strange but provocative industry. While the job wasn't all bad, I could not imagine writing for another reality show. The longer I did, I thought, the more I would stray from the kind of writer I wanted to be: one whose chief concern was not how to make sense out of chaos, but to tell the messiest parts of life in the truest and most honest way I knew.

No, that's not a typo or a joke. I have created a Docker container containing a single Unix executable with no dependencies that occupies less than 1 KB of space on disk. There are no other files included in the container — not even libc.
Here's the proof.
Why?
Before explaning how this was accomplished, it is worth explaining why this was accomplished. caddy-docker (which is another tool I wrote and explain in detail here) routes incoming requests to running containers based on their labels.
I needed caddy-docker to act as a reverse proxy for a particular host and the easiest way to do that was by spinning up a container whose sole purpose was to contain two special labels. The container should not do anything until it is stopped.
That's when I came up with an idea.
What?
I immediately began working on the application, naming it “hang” for its rather unusual purpose. Go can easily produce executables that have no dependencies, allowing the Docker container to inherit from scratch . The only downside is that Go executables tend to be massive, even very simple ones often exceed 8 MB in size.
This would never do.
I reasoned that a C application could easily be written that registered a signal handler for SIGTERM and quit when it was received. Unfortunately, this meant that I would need to use libc, which in turn meant the container would quickly become comparable in size to the Go executable. This would provide no advantage at all.
Assembly?
Yes, the quickest way to produce a tiny executable with no dependencies is to write it in assembly. I prefer Intel-style syntax so NASM was the obvious choice.
Syscalls
Once upon a time, back in the early days of the x86 architecture, a syscall looked something like this:
mov eax, 0x01 mov ebx, 0x00 int 0x80
The first line specifies which syscall to invoke — sys_exit in this case. The second line specifies the exit value (0). The third line generates an interrupt which the kernel will then process.
x86 operating systems later moved to using sysenter / sysret while x86_64 introduced a new (aptly named) opcode: syscall . Similar to the example above, the rax register is used for specifying the specific syscall to invoke. The example above could be rewritten in x86_64 assembly like this:
mov rax, 0x3c mov rdi, 0x00 syscall
Note that the syscall number for sys_exit is different on x86_64.
Signal Handlers
Registering a signal handler is fairly trivial in C:
#include <signal.h> void handler(int param) {} int main() { struct sigaction sa; sa.sa_handler = handler; sigaction(SIGTERM, &sa, 0); return 0; }
Unfortunately, a couple of things are being hidden by the C standard library:
the flag SA_RESTORER is added to sa.sa_flags
is added to the sa.sa_restorer member is set to a special function
We cannot directly translate the C code to assembly since the sigaction struct doesn't correspond to the one sys_rt_sigaction expects. Here's what the kernel struct looks like in NASM:
struc sigaction .sa_handler resq 1 .sa_flags resq 1 .sa_restorer resq 1 .sa_mask resq 1 endstruc
Each member is 8-bytes in size.
Setting the Signal Handler
First, we must allocate space for the struct in the .bss section:
section .bss act resb sigaction_size
Note that sigaction_size is a special value the assembler creates for us — it is equal to the size of sigaction in bytes. The struct can then be initialized in the .text section like so:
section .text global _start lea rax, [handler] mov [act + sigaction.sa_handler], rax mov [act + sigaction.sa_flags], dword 0x04000000 ; SA_RESTORER lea rax, [restorer] mov [act + sigaction.sa_restorer], rax
handler and restorer are labels that we'll come to in a moment. Now we can invoke the sys_rt_sigaction syscall:
mov rax, 0x0d ; sys_rt_sigaction mov rdi, 0x0f ; SIGTERM lea rsi, [act] mov rdx, 0x00 mov r10, 0x08 syscall
Handling the Signal
The next step is waiting for the SIGTERM signal to arrive. The sys_pause syscall easily accomplishes this:
mov rax, 0x22 ; sys_pause syscall
The handler itself is fairly trivial — it doesn't really do anything:
handler: ret
The restorer is fairly simple as well, though it does need to invoke the sys_rt_sigreturn syscall:
restorer: mov rax, 0x0f ; sys_rt_sigreturn syscall
Building
Two commands are required to build the application. Assuming the source file is named hang.asm , the commands are:
nasm -f elf64 hang.asm ld -s -o hang hang.o
This produces an executable named hang — and it's small:
$ stat hang File: hang Size: 736
Yes, that's 736 bytes.
The Dockerfile is fairly simple, requiring only two commands:
FROM scratch ADD hang /usr/bin/hang ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/hang"]
Testing
Let's see if the container works:
$ docker build -t nathanosman/hang . $ docker run -d --name hang nathanosman/hang
At this point, the container should remain running:
$ docker ps -a CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND STATUS f1861f628ea8 nathanosman/hang "/usr/bin/hang" Up 3 seconds
It should also immediately stop when docker stop is run:
$ docker stop hang hang
It works! Let's make sure the container is only as large as the executable:
$ docker images REPOSITORY TAG CREATED SIZE nathanosman/hang latest 2 minutes ago 736B
And there you have it — a really tiny container!

I am Phil Walker-Harding, a game designer from Sydney, Australia. I have been designing for almost 10 years now, although most of that time I was doing it pretty casually and occasionally self-publishing my own designs as Adventureland Games . In the past year or so I have been focusing more on just design and working with other publishers. My games include Sushi Go! , Cacao , Imhotep and the various editions of Archaeology .
About a decade ago I got back into the board gaming hobby by discovering games like The Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne and Lost Cities. Not long after this, I started designing games again. I say “again”, because when I was quite young I used to design my own games as well. My brother and cousin and I would often come up with games together, usually silly takes on what we were playing at the time. We would make our own components from cardboard and paper, and would have a great time playing them (in most cases, only once!). Modern board games showed me that there can be far more strategy, social interaction and fun in games than I had ever seen in the mass-market games I played growing up. This was really exciting for me, and it re-sparked that part of my brain that enjoyed making board games. So I decided to give designing another shot!
The first game I started working on had a pirate theme. The players explored an island built from a modular board looking for treasures. They could also sail around the island in their boat and had to contend with changing weather. But the game was not that great. It took way too long to play, and often you would find yourself with nothing that interesting to do on your turn but walk – which didn't exactly bring the pirate theme to life! However, I noticed that players quite enjoyed trying to collect sets of treasure cards as they explored the island. The way treasures worked in the game was actually inspired by Lost Cities. I loved how in that game the very same card could be worth a huge amount to you at one point in the game, but at another point could be just clogging up your hand. I wanted my treasures to have this feeling of varying value, so I made each type score based on how many of that type you had. Just 1 of a type was not worth much of anything, but full sets were very valuable. If this was the most fun part of the game, it occurred to me to make a whole new game that was just this – collecting treasures!
I think I chose the theme and title of “Archaeology” right away. It seemed like the perfect backdrop for trying to assemble sets of treasures. I knew the game would mainly revolve around cards, but I think I just assumed the game would need a board and other components as well. I started working hard at the game, and at the same time I began researching how I could self-publish a small print run. There were a few people in those days making small hand-made runs of games to sell online (this was way before Kickstarter!). I thought this was the easiest path to get the game into the hands of gamers. After playtesting with friends, a few months later “Archaeology” was complete and I put together 50 copies. This first batch was snapped up quite quickly, which was very encouraging. I made another 50 and sold them at a games convention here in Australia. People seemed to enjoy the game, but the more seasoned gamers who played it also had some pretty strong critiques. It was hard as a brand-new designer to hear some of this, but I also knew I wanted to get better at designing. I thought about how I could take some of these suggestions on board for improving the game. At the same time, self-producing a full board game had been really time consuming, and I knew I couldn't do it sustainably. Then the idea hit me – I could do a new edition of the game that was just cards. I could rework the rules, and it would be much easier to produce as well! I think this first experience taught me how important it is as a designer to just get your games out there. Especially when you start out, releasing something even on a small scale can be so valuable for getting feedback and improving your skills.
I released Archaeology: The Card Game quite soon after, and again hand-produced around 100 copies to start with. It was much easier to make – I had the first edition made by a business card printer. This version had the same interesting set collection mechanism, but I re-worked some of the cards and changed the structure of the game somewhat to make it more exciting and have a push-your-luck element. There was a bit more interest in the game this time, so I made additional print runs and got it into a few shops. I was also very happy and surprised to win the inaugural Boardgames Australia Best Australian Game prize! At the convention where I received the award, Z-Man games happened to have a booth. I got to meet Zev and after playing a game, he said he would like to publish it! I was of course over the moon, and it was so exciting to see the game reach a far wider audience over the next few years.
I continued designing games and self-published quite a few more as the years went by. Slowly, more of my titles began being picked up by publishers too, including Sushi Go! and Cacao. While I always looked back fondly on Archaeology: The Card Game, my design tastes had shifted somewhat and I did see a few flaws in the original design. Then quite out the blue, Z-Man decided that they would like to do a new edition of the game and asked if I had any ideas for new content. What a great opportunity to go back and revisit the design (again)! I got to work on it right away, and found it exciting to get to apply what I'd learnt over the years to an older game.
At first I thought about making some quite radical changes to make the game less lucky, less swingy and have less take-that. However, I quickly realised that these changes would basically not make the game Archaeology anymore! Further, the game had found an audience that really enjoyed its gameplay style, so I thought I should respect that and not change the game too much. In the end I did introduce the Tent cards, which allow the players to dodge a sandstorm (these are event cards which make you discard treasures). While only a small change, it did give a sense of extra control and security to your hand. I also knew I wanted to expand the number of cards in the game to allow for 5 players to play, as the original could only accommodate 4. For a light card game, I usually find the more the merrier, so I came up with a couple of new treasure types to add to the deck. Next I wanted to re-work the way a few cards scored. After playing the game for so many years, I came to see which cards players always go for, and how various treasures are most commonly used. For example, I found that Talismans were almost always traded at the market, as they just didn't feel worth it to collect a set for points. This led me to re-balance the values on many cards. Often these tweaks were small, but I think they really help the decision space in the game. Now there are fewer situations where there is an obvious best move in terms of trading in treasures or holding on to them.
Finally, I wanted to add something to the game that felt like a legitimate expansion for it. As a simple game, there aren't many mechanisms that can really have anything new bolted on to them. However, it occurred to me that if the players could explore the Pyramid (a mechanism where you turn in Map cards for some unknown treasures), why couldn't they explore other ancient monuments as well? I started investigating other ways that Map cards could be used to get treasures: looking through different sized piles, having treasures appear over time, and so on. These new monuments were lots of fun to design. I submitted 4 of them to Z-Man and they said they liked them but would really like there to be 6 in the game! I was sure I had come up with every interesting possibility, but with their great suggestions I managed to find 2 more. This is a nice little example of how working with a developer on your game can really push you to improve it.
Z-Man got the wonderful Atha Kanaani to illustrate the new edition of Archaeology, which would now be known as “The New Expedition”. When the first art samples arrived, I was so enamoured with them! The illustrations were such a huge improvement on the originals (which I had done myself) and had so many great details in them. The cover I especially loved, as it captured the mood of the theme and the period absolutely perfectly. It was so satisfying to see this little game I had come up with so long ago presented in its best light. So it has been quite a journey from designing a game about pirate treasure to Archaeology: The New Expedition! I'd like to thank everyone out there who has played the various versions of the game and shared it with friends and family. Keep on exploring!

Quentin Tarantino appeared on "All In With Chris Hayes" Wednesday night to defend himself against allegations that he's "anti-police."
Police unions across the country have called for a boycott of the director's work after he spoke at an anti-police brutality rally in New York last week. "What am I doing here?" he asked. "I'm doing here [sic] because I am a human being with a conscience, and when I see murder, I cannot stand by, and I have to call the murdered, and I have to call the murderers."

After being criticized by the presidents of the police unions in Philadelphia and New York City, Tarantino told The Los Angeles Times that he "never said" all cops are murderers. "I never said that. I never even implied that.”
"What they're doing is pretty obvious," he added. "Instead of dealing with the incidents of police brutality that those people were bringing up, instead of examining the problem of police brutality in this country, better they single me out."
"Their message is very clear: It's to shut me down. It's to discredit me. It is to intimidate me. It is to shut my mouth, and even more important than that, it is to send a message out to any other prominent person that might feel the need to join that side of the argument."
He reiterated those sentiments on "All In" Wednesday night, telling Hayes that "I was at a rally for people, mostly black or brown, who were shot and killed, or beaten or strangled, by the police. And I was obviously referring to the people in those kinds of situations."
"You were referring to specific cases in which police took the life of someone in ways that you think were murder?" Hayes asked.
"Yes," Tarantino replied, "they were murder." Speaking in particular about the Walter Scott incident -- in which police were captured on camera using deadly force -- Tarantino said that the only reason that some of these incidents were "deemed murder is because they were caught on video. If they hadn't, the murderers would've gotten away with their murder."

"There's something about that word that has set off police unions and police officers," Hayes said. "Are you surprised by the vitriol with which they've responded to those comments?"
"Well, yeah," Tarantino replied. "I was surprised. I was under the impression I was an American and had First Amendment rights, and there's no problem with me attending an anti-police brutality protest and speaking my mind. Just because I'm against brutality doesn't mean I'm anti-police."
"They would rather start arguments with celebrities than examine the concerns put before them by a citizenry that has lost trust in them."

Last week, in advance of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: The Illustrated Edition‘s release, EW exclusively revealed four of illustrator Jim Kay's stunning images. Now, you can read our full conversation with Kay, who tells us how he scored the opportunity of a lifetime (he'll illustrate all seven Harry Potter books), and how he's breathing new life into these already beloved characters and scenes.
How did you land this incredible project?
My agent just rang up one day and said, “Are you sitting down? Harry Potter. Seven books. What do you think?” At first I wasn't sure because I'm a big fan of the films. But I thought, “Gosh, I can design everything: the costumes, the architecture, the people, the creatures.” That's a dream commission.

Were you nervous?
I didn't sleep for months. I was just terrified. I used to get terrible shakes when I was drawing. Normally, in publishing, you work on a book that no one's read before, unless it's a classic, like Alice in Wonderland or Peter Pan. But everybody's read Harry Potter, and everybody has an opinion on it as well. But you don't get in the ring without expecting a few punches, so you have to brace yourself for those.
We'll see what happens when the book comes out. I don't think, “Oh, how can I please everybody?” You just think, “How can I please the author?” That's all you can do: Please the author, and please yourself. Then if other people like it, that'll be a bonus.
After you said yes, what was your first step?
[The publisher] Bloomsbury was very open-minded, so I started just by drawing and drawing. There were no demands, no “You've got to have this scene!” I envy illustrators with a lovely, consistent style, but I change styles like I change my pants. So there are oils in there, acrylics, watercolor, digital coloring. Things that weren't necessarily supposed to be in the book got in: the architectural studies, the insects, the leaves. There's an illustration of a cat in the front door of Hogwarts at night—that was a concept drawing that ended up in there.
There's a lot of art in the book, and with incredible detail.
I would notice blank spaces and think, “Oh, I could fit an illustration in there.” At the beginning we were saying, “Well, this is going to be about atmosphere, with hints of detail every now and again.” And then I would sit and draw every shop in Diagon Alley. In the books there are lots of gaps between the shops in Diagon Alley, so I said, “Do you mind if I fill the gaps?” Very good of the author to let me fiddle about and add bits and pieces.

Tell us about your process.
I'm always trying to find a style. I don't think I have a style, and I desperately want one. I envy all these illustrators that have a lovely, consistent style. But I sort of chance styles like I change my pants! Just because I like trying different things. So there are oils in there, there are acrylics, watercolor paper, there's a bit of print. Everything, drawing, digital coloring, everything. Just because I get bored really quickly, so I like to try different things.
Then I work with models: I've always done it, ever since I was a little kid. I used to make things out of Lego and draw it. For me, it's getting my head around three-dimensional objects, which is always difficult when you're drawing. For the cover, I made a train out of cardboard and foamboard. It's very quick – you only spend a few minutes on them.
A few minutes?
I do have a plastine and paper model of Hogwarts, too, and that took a couple of hours. But I can't spend too long because I've got so many illustrations to do. It takes me five or six attempts on each one, so if you have a hundred illustrations in book, you have 500 or 600 images you're working on. Models are just great because you can light them as well, and I love playing around with lighting. I tend to think of illustrations as little film sets, so I'll set up people, and then I'll change the lighting and the camera angle.
I can't believe you made and drew from models even when you were a kid.
Yeah. [Then] I went to work in museums and libraries, and didn't draw for about 10 or 11 years. I think I started [again] when I was moaning about an artist that had gotten an exhibition, and a friend of mine said, “You know, you've got no right to complain about this, because at least this artist is doing it. This artist is trying, and it's really hard. It's really hard to keep putting yourself out there and to raise the money to do this, and to put on exhibitions.” She was right. So I started drawing in the evenings and just went from there.
I did a solo exhibition, then I got some publishing jobs from that, and then it sort of grew from there. I got A Monster Calls, the Patrick Ness book, and little bits and pieces: concept work for television, stuff like that. It hadn't been a great deal until Harry Potter came along, which is why it was slightly daunting, because I'd not really drawn children before.
Are children more difficult to draw?
They're really hard to draw, because you know, you age them. With just two lines, you can age a child five years if you put the lines in the wrong places. If this were a one-off book, I probably wouldn't have done it, but as it's a series, I thought it'd be best to find real children that I can follow and track how they physically change throughout the seven-year period. It's just a way of getting past the technical problems of drawing a child that ages over seven books.
Readers are definitely attached to the books, but we also have concrete images of the characters because of the films. How did you work around these visuals people already have in their minds?
The text is absolute king. It's the most important thing, and you have to remind yourself, as an illustrator, to do this, because once you start scribbling and drawing, you can very easily wander off-script. You have to constantly remind yourself to go back, and keep checking what the author's put. The surprising thing is that actually Jo puts very little physical description for the characters, which is nice. It gets the reader to formulate their own idea.
So I will check through all seven books, every description of every character. The same for everything: The architecture, the villages. I have this sort of bible, as it were, of descriptions of characters, and I keep referring to that. Then I had to cast the book, effectively in the same way that you cast a film.
That actually makes a lot of sense. The characters feel so real, and consistent.
There are a lot of portraits in book one because that's me saying, “These are my characters, this is how I see them.” What you have to do, if you want to distance yourself from a very, very successful film franchise and try and make it your own, you have to say, “Well this is the world I'm creating.” So in book 1 and book 2, there are a few static portraits, just to put down the face of the characters.

Who was your inspiration for Harry?
I was looking at all these photographs of evacuee children from the 1940s — in England, you'd call them “blitz kids” — who have been taken away from their home during the blitz. They had sort of thick, scruffy hair, and round glasses, and looked sort of underfed and malnourished, from really tough East End parts of London as well. I wanted that real character coming through, some adversity. But also slightly fragile, because he's thin, and he's smaller than usual.
So I was on the London Underground, and I saw a young boy hanging from the bars in the tube train. His mom was with him, and I just said, “This might sound really odd, but I think your boy's got a great look to him, and I illustrate children's books. I'm looking for a young male character to work from.” Luckily, his mum was very good with this sort of thing because her son, Clay, is a stage performer. He's very used to acting and performing and things like that, which has been great.
I read that your niece inspired Hermione.
Yeah — she's smart, but she's also slightly bossy. She's wonderful. She's more of an adult than I am. I'm always messing about, and she's always correcting me. I think she's perfect for Hermione, very sensible, and very embarrassed on my behalf all the time. Even walking down the street with her, I think I embarrass her.
Who inspired Ron?
His mum was a librarian at a school where I was giving a talk, so I met his mum, and I saw her son come in, and I just knew straightaway. He's got great character, and he's a really nice lad as well. He doesn't have red hair, but it's not so much that that I'm after, it's just the way they walk about, the way they chat, you know. He's got a very good sense of humor.

Tell us about Dumbledore's portrait.
There's a painter that was active in England in Henry the Eighth's court called Holbein, and he'd do these beautiful oil portraits of very wealthy members of the court. What I like about early portrait painting is that you often have images, objects that are representative of that person's trade or character.
So in Dumbledore's portrait, the dried plant there is honesty, but on the honesty is also a little camouflaged praying mantis insect. It's saying there is honesty, but with a catch, with Dumbledore. There's also a little bottle of dragon's blood, because he wrote a book on dragon's blood when he was younger. There's knitting, of course, because he likes to knit.
He's based on an illustrator I know, who I absolutely idolize. He's been an inspiration for years for me, so it's a huge big deal for me that he's lent his face to Dumbledore.
Where did you get the idea for the deeply atmospheric illustration of the quidditch rings?
That one was not intended to be in the book! I was trying this watercolor technique at the time, and I did it as a preparatory sketch for what was supposed to be the final illustration, but [Bloomsbury] liked the looseness of it. Where I lived in Edinburgh, you call them ‘murmurations of starlings' when the birds form these beautiful swirling patterns, so I thought it would be nice to have starlings on the quidditch hoops.
I'm trying to do what people won't expect, which is why I put images of the trolls, and dragon eggs [elsewhere in the book], even Hermione with the flame in the jar. It's literally almost a throwaway sentence: I think Jo says something like, “Hermione had with her a flame she made in a jam jar,” so I thought, “I'd like to show her doing that.” I'm trying to do stuff thats almost parallel to the book, not always literally representing every line or sentence that's in the book. I don't think there's any point in getting an illustrator unless you let them flesh it out in some way.
Jim Kay for Bloomsbury Publishing
Some of my favorite illustrations were the ghosts of Hogwarts. How did you make those stunning light blues and neon colors that just glow off of the page?
I paint in reverse. So for example, if you're painting a ghost's face, where there are shadows, I leave it white, but where there are highlights, I paint it black. So I paint the ghost in red, and then digitally invert it, so that it becomes blue. All the dark colors become light colors, and all the light colors are shadows.
It's a funny thing to do, but I've found if you do that on wet paper, when you reverse it, you get this sort of glow effect where the paint has spread through the wet paper. It was by accident, really. I discovered it and I thought, “Well, that could be quite good for the ghosts.” And I've used it on a few other things as well: Some lighting and cloud effects, things like that.
The difficult thing is painting someone's face back to front. It's like looking at a negative of a photograph. In the old days, when you used to get film photographs, you'd look at the negative and see they've got sort of white eyes and black teeth. It took a lot of attempts to get it right. I think I filled two drawers with attempts to get Nearly Headless Nick to work.
Really?
Yeah, I don't find illustration easy at all. I really struggle with it. I think that's why I do it, because you know that everything you do, you're pushing yourself. I'm not a natural illustrator, by any means. I'm just one of those who throws hours and hours at each image, and eventually something works. I keep the ones that do, and the 90% that don't, I get rid of.
Have you met Jo Rowling?
No! She sent me a really nice letter. I'd love to meet her, but I thought, “Let's just see how book 1 goes.” You don't want to be the person who kills the most successful children's-book franchise.
There's probably not much danger of that.
Well, that's good. It's a frightening thing, to feel so much responsibility. I want to do as much justice as I can.
You've got six more books ahead. What are you most excited about?
I'm really itching to get to things like Azkaban, the Shrieking Shack. There's a terrible temptation to rush forward and start designing stuff for the Deathly Hallows! But it's a few years off yet. I just have to keep it in check and go chronologically.
12:09pm: Hamilton intends to try his hand at first base, as MLB.com's T.R. Sullivan tweets. Presumably, he could also factor in the corner outfield and DH mix. The organization has been rumored to be pursuing alternatives at first and DH, where Joey Gallo and Jurickson Profar currently rate as the top options on the depth chart.
11:38am: Texas has announced the deal. Hamilton will earn at the league-minimum rate if he makes it to the majors, Heyman tweets. That's not surprising, of course, as Hamilton's free-agent deal ran through the 2017 season. Most of his $30MM salary will be paid for by the Angels, though the Rangers did also take on a total of $6MM (for the 2015-17 seasons) when they acquired Hamilton.
11:18am: The Rangers have wrapped up an agreement to re-sign one-time star slugger Josh Hamilton, per Jon Heyman of Fan Rag (via Twitter). A deal has been expected since late in 2016.
Hamilton's minor-league pact will give him the right to opt out on April 1 if he has not yet been added to the MLB roster. He'll obviously hope to earn a spot in the major-league mix during spring camp, but it's not known whether he'd look to pursue an opportunity elsewhere if Texas doesn't offer him a big league job to open the year.
There remain many questions facing the 35-year-old Hamilton, who was expected to play a significant role for the Rangers last year but ended up requiring consecutive knee surgeries. The veteran outfielder made a brief and largely uninspiring appearance with Texas in 2015, after he was acquired from the Angels, but hasn't put together a full season since 2013.
While Hamilton didn't maintain his All-Star-level production upon leaving the Rangers to join the Angels in 2013, he did manage to put up a .255/.316/.426 batting line — good for a 110 OPS+ — during his two years in Los Angeles. If he can return to that sort of hitting, he'd likely be a solid piece for the Rangers, though talent has never been the lone issue. Hamilton, after all, has long dealt with balky knees and battled substance abuse, and he'll need to maintain his overall health in order to be a productive member of the organization.
With his recent wins in Malaysia and Mexico, Max Verstappen's already ascending star continues to rise to even greater heights. But does that mean we know any more about motorsport's most famous Dutchman? Time to find out… Q: Apart from driving a Formula 1 car, what is your favourite buzz? Max Verstappen: Don't laugh: karting! Q: Which film last made you cry? MV: Actually I am a comedy person. Laughing is my thing. Stupid funny movies. Movies that are so stupid that they are really funny! (Laughs) Q: What are you afraid of? MV: I guess in this I am like everybody else: I am not a big fan of spiders and sharks.
Swimming with sharks? Not something Max Verstappen would ever contemplate doing...
Q: What was the last book you read? MV: Actually I read two books lately: the biography of Johan Cruyff, famous Dutch football player, and his book about coaching a team. Q: What did your teachers say about you in your school report? MV: It was the same every single year: that I could do so much better if I was interested. But I hated it. Q: Do you have any guilty pleasures? MV: I like fizzy drinks. (Laughs) Q: Do you collect anything? MV: No. Q: What do you miss most about home when you're travelling? MV: Family and friends. Q: What was your worst buy? MV: I am not sure if I have ever done that. I normally always think first, like before I bought my PlayStation kit. I carry it with me all over the world – so that I can play FIFA!
Late football legend Johan Cruyff - Max is a big fan...
Q: What's the most embarrassing mistake you've ever made? MV: Crashing in the pit lane. Q: When was the last time you were really angry? MV: A few days ago. I think it might have been in the US... Q: Which superpower would you prefer: being able to fly or being able to become invisible? MV: Being able to fly. An Ironman/Spider-Man mix! You have the webs and the jets. For sure, nothing where you have to wear tights all the time! Q: Do you sing in the shower? MV: No singing at all! Q: Do you believe in love at first sight? MV: It can happen, yes.
Karting: He loved it then and he loves it now...
It's amazing how ideas with no merit become popular merely because they sound good.
Most every politician and pundit says "energy independence" is a great idea. Presidents have promised it for 35 years. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we were self-sufficient, protected from high prices, supply disruptions and political machinations?
The hitch is that even if the United States were energy independent, it would be protected from none of those things. To think otherwise is to misunderstand basic economics and the global marketplace.
To be for "energy independence" is to be against trade. But trade makes us as safe. Crop destruction from this summer's floods in the Midwest should remind us of the folly of depending only on ourselves. Achieving "energy independence" would expose us to unnecessary risks -- such as storms that knock out oil refineries or droughts that create corn -- and ethanol -- shortages.
Trade also saves us money. "We import energy for a reason," says the Cato Institute's energy expert, Jerry Taylor, "It's cheaper than producing it here at home. A governmental war on energy imports will, by definition, raise energy prices".
Anyway, a "domestic energy only" policy (call it "Drain America First"?) is a fantasy. America's demand for oil is too great for us to supply ourselves. Electricity we could provide. Not with windmills and solar panels -- they are not yet close to providing enough -- but coal and nuclear power could produce America's electricity.
But cars need oil. We don't have nearly enough.
That doesn't keep the presidential candidates from preying on the public's economic ignorance.
"I have set before the American people an energy plan, the Lexington Project -- named for the town where Americans asserted their independence once before," John McCain said. "This nation will achieve strategic independence by 2025".
Barack Obama, promising to "set America on path to energy independence," is upset that we send millions to other countries. "They get our money because we need their oil ".
His concern that "they get our money" is echoed in commercials funded by Republican businessman T. Boone Pickens, who wants government subsidies for alternative energy. He tries to scare us by saying, "$700 billion are leaving this country to foreign nations every year -- the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind."
Don't Obama and Pickens realize that we get something useful for that money? It's not a "transfer"; it's a win-win transaction, like all voluntary trade. Who cares if the sellers live in a foreign country? When two parties trade, each is better off -- or the exchange would never have been made. We want the oil more than the money. They want the money more than the oil. They need us as much as we need them.
And Obama is wrong when he implies that America imports most of its oil from the Mideast. Most of it comes from Canada and Mexico.
What makes Obama think he's qualified to pick the "best plans"? It's the robust competition of the free market that reveals what's best. Obama's program would preempt the only good method we have for learning which form of energy is best.
Has he learned nothing from the conceits of his predecessors? Jimmy Carter, saying that achieving energy independence was the "moral equivalent of war," called for "the most massive peacetime commitment of funds ... to develop America's own alternative". Then he wasted billions of our tax dollars on the utterly failed "synfuel" program.
McCain promises a $300-million prize to whoever develops a battery for an electric car. But the free market already provides plenty of incentive to invent a better battery. As George Mason University economist Donald Boudreaux writes, "Anyone who develops such a device will earn profits dwarfing $300 million simply by selling it on the market. There's absolutely no need for any such taxpayer-funded prize".
Central energy planning and government-funded prizes are economic idiocy.
On Thursday this week, the original "draftnik," ESPN's Mel Kiper, published his first mock draft of the offseason. I can say with a high level of certainty that it will be very, very wrong. Mock drafts are what they are – a good way to learn a little something about the top prospects who will be selected in or around the first round of the draft. If you're looking for accuracy, forget it.
This isn't to goof on Kiper – OK, maybe a tiny bit – but as we did last year, let's take a look at who your team would have drafted if Kiper were 100 percent accurate on his mock drafts since 2010:

This is part of a series of essays by panellists featured on the new CBC Arts talk show The Filmmakers. A panellist from each episode writes about the film being featured this week, which this week is CBC's own film critic Eli Glasner discussing Sarah Polley's Stories We Tell. You can watch Glasner alongside journalist and documentary filmmaker Francine Pelletier and filmmaker and the National Film Board of Canada's Anita Lee in the above video, and watch the entire episode this Saturday at 8:30pm (9pm NT) on CBC Television or online at cbc.ca/watch.
"When you are in the middle of a story it isn't a story at all, but only a confusion; a dark roaring, a blindness."
In his beautiful rolling baritone, those are the words spoken by Michael Polley — Sarah Polley's father — that begin the documentaryStories We Tell. The text, from Margaret Atwood's novel Alias Grace, is as apt as ever.
Our own stories are a roaring confusion where we are all irrevocably trapped in the tumult of ourselves — but a great work of art has the power to change perspectives. This is what makes Polley's 2012 film so remarkable: it begins with her own personal experience, but in the end, it becomes a universal meditation on memory.
I recently had the pleasure of revisiting the award-winning documentary as member of the panel on the new CBC TV series The Filmmakers with producer Anita Lee, journalist Francine Pelletier, myself and host Johanna Schneller, a well-known film critic.
Sarah Polley's Stories We Tell, airing this weekend as part of CBC Arts' new Saturday night film programming. (National Film Board of Canada)
For a film exploring the hidden history of Polley's parents Michael and Diane, Stories We Tell walks a dazzling tightrope, teasing out Polley's own backstory under layers of meta moviemaking. The camera exposes the process, Polley coaching her father's performance while a Greek chorus of siblings and friends share their recollections.
But one of the most surprising elements of Stories We Tell is that Sarah Polley agreed to make it. As she told Schellner on The Filmmakers : "I don't think I ever really wanted a lot of attention from people I don't know."
Unlike many actors, Polley didn't want to be famous. She'd already had a taste of child stardom from her role in Road to Avonlea and had had her fill of a life in the public eye. As NFB producer Anita Lee explained during the panel: "The challenge for Sarah was that Sarah actually didn't want to be in the film."
In a way, she got her wish. Although Stories We Tell is her story, for much of the film Polley is on the periphery, lurking off camera, calmly interrogating her sisters and brothers and teasing out their version of events. It's only near the end as the ripples from the revelations have subsided that Polley turns the lens on herself.
As I said when I originally reviewed it, the result is one of the most captivating documentaries in a decade. The danger with this kind of postmodern approach is that it can appear as a dry academic exercise. But Polley brought to her own story the rigour she's applied to all her projects — to astonishing effect.

With her films Away From Her and Take this Waltz, Polley challenged our ideas on aging and fidelity. Here she challenges herself, deconstructing her family's own myths with a director's eye for emotion.
At the outset, what thrilled me about Stories We Tell was the construction: the warm and witty way Polley introduced us to her family; the faux footage of Super-8 home movies; the captivating archival tape of her mother Diane singing "Ain't Misbehavin'". As with her narrative films, the recurring theme one of unflinching honesty. This is a film where you see the seams — the subjects fidgeting in frame as the roaring confusion is resolved.
aporeticelenchus:
“Enjolras was a charming young man, who was capable of being terrible. He was angelically handsome. He was a savage Antinous.”
If you've seen any amount of Roman art, it's likely you've come across this handsome fellow before:
Antinous is one of the best known faces (…and other parts) of the ancient world because there were so many statues of him made.
Antinous was the lover of the Roman emperor Hadrian, in the 2nd century CE. Hadrian was very public about his relationship with Antinous, and treated him as more like a spouse than a lover. However, what makes Antinous most famous is probably his early death and Hadrian's public and intense mourning. Antinous drowned in the Nile river (under unknown circumstances) at the age of 19 when he and Hadrian were in Egypt together. Hadrian took it…badly. Very badly. He had Antinous deified - something that was practically unheard of for someone outside of the royal family and more than a little scandalous - and there was a fairly successful cult of Antinous for the next few decades. He also had a ridiculous number of statues made - I remember hearing once that there were dozens of statues of Antinous found just at Hadrian's Villa in Tivoli. Because of the sheer number of statues many of them of been preserved, meaning we actually have a decent idea what he looked like!
So what the name “Antinous” would have meant to Hugo is beautiful young man who died very young, emperor's male lover, and minor religious figure. I don't think it's hard to see why he'd like the comparison for Enjolras. Antinous has also functioned as an icon of male homosexuality, although I'm not 100% sure whether that would have been the case in the 1830s. I suspect it would have; it's certainly a thing among the Victorians a few decades later.
A few more pictures under the cut! (including the obligatory butt photo)

In January 2017, a photograph appeared to show a poster on display at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., listing off early warning signs of looming fascism:
In the US Holocaust Museum.
I'm shook. pic.twitter.com/EeuHEXWusE — Sarah Rose (@RaRaVibes) January 30, 2017
The picture was shared with criticism of President Donald Trump, as people claimed that his administration had already checked off several of the boxes on the list:
The poster is real, in the sense that it exists in a physical form; however, it was not created by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, nor was it on display at one of the museum's exhibits.
You can see a price tag in the bottom right corner of the viral image. Sarah Rose, who first shared the photograph on social media, confirmed to us that she took the picture in the museum's gift shop. We reached out to the USHHM to confirm that it sold a poster showing “early warning signs of fascism,” and they told us that the museum no longer carries the poster.
The list was originally created by Laurence Britt in 2003, for an article published by Free Inquiry magazine (a publication for secular humanist commentary and analysis). While subsequent postings of the list often attribute it to “Dr. Laurence Britt,” the author said that he was not actually a doctor (nor did he claim to be). Britt himself said that he could be more accurately described as an amateur historian:
I've read this thread with interest. For your information I never made a claim that I was a “Dr.” Someone on the internet made that ASSUMPTION when they passed on the artice. I am a retired bsunessman with a life long interst in history and current events. I have a personal book collection on these subjects of over 3000 volumes. I've contributed chapters to three books, written another, and am I working on a second. I've written aproximately 25 magazines and newespaper articles on political and econmic affairs. I spent about 200 hours researching the fascism article building on a lifetime interst in the subject. My novel, “June , 2004” was written in 1997 and published in 1998. It was a fictional treatment of a future of fascism in America, which has turned out quite predictive of actual events since it was published.Regards, Larry Britt
Britt created this list during George W. Bush's tenure as president of the United States. While he did not actually name Bush, he wrote in the original article that some of the early warning signs had already manifested in the United States:
Does any of this ring alarm bells? Of course not. After all, this is America, officially a democracy with the rule of law, a constitution, a free press, honest elections, and a well-informed public constantly being put on guard against evils. Historical comparisons like these are just exercises in verbal gymnastics. Maybe, maybe not.
While the text in the image is difficult to read, another version of the poster sold by Syracuse Cultural Workers carries the same (more legible) disclaimer:
Laurence W. Britt wrote about the common signs of fascism in April 2003, after researching seven fascists regimes. Those were Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany, Benito Mussolini's Italy, Francisco Franco's Spain, Antontio de Oliveira Salazar's Portual, George Papadopoulos's Greece, August Pinochet's Chile, Mohamed Suharto's Indonesia. These signs resonate with the political and economic direction of the United states under Bush/Cheney. Get involved in reversing this anti-democratic direction while you still can!
While it is true that this poster exists, it was not displayed the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and has since been removed from its gift shop.
Exhibit One
CBC reported that a driver with a dashboard camera driving along Ellington Street EB captures a video of the alleged shooter, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, casually walking to his car, a Toyota Corolla, and getting in.
This is in conflict of witnesses stating they saw Bibeau running across the street, suggested by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's timeline of events:
http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa-shooting-how-events-unfolded-1.2809260
Jan Lugtenborg, a Dutch tourist, was waiting for a tour bus when he heard four shots.
“The guy who shot, he was a small man with long black hair,” Lugtenborg said. The shooter “suddenly crossed the street with his long rifle … running like hell” towards Parliament Hill.
In the dashboard video of Bibeau it is evident that he is not armed, or at least it appears he has nothing in his hands. One would be hard pressed to think he is concealing a gun considering he had it out and opened fire on Corporal Cirillo just moments before. Since the weapon was allegedly a long gun it would be obvious under his coat.
Next, this occurs in between Elgin street which is one-way north on the east side of the Memorial and one-way south on the west side, converging into a two-way street south of the Memorial site. Also, Ellington Street is divided by a concrete curb median.
Keep this in mind, a surveillance video released and narrated by Royal Canadian Mounted Police's Bob Paulson clearly shows a Toyota making a left hand westbound turn from Elgin moving northbound, which is a one way southbound street. It is difficult to understand how Bibeau went from being on Ellington eastbound at 9:51:51, then at 9:52:15 seen making a left-hand turn onto Ellington westbound from Elgin, which is a one-way street south, with the latter likely involving a very precarious maneuver . It's approximately 250m to get to the bollards in front of East Block from where he was parked on Ellington street facing east at the Memorial.
The would-be gunman had no choice but to proceed eastbound on Ellington and make a U-turn just up the road to head back towards the Parliament building.
We should have seen the Toyota coming along Ellington from a distance. There is no other way unless he went in reverse against the traffic but there was not a single witness to suggest this possibility. If Bibeau did start driving in reverse on Ellington Street it would have drawn attention from drivers to honk their horns and draw at least one eye-witness. Yet no such commotion is documented.
Instead, we have only this video of Bibeau getting in his car and other witnesses who claim they saw him run across the street towards the Parliament buildings.
What to make of these two videos?
If Bibeau continued eastbound and made a u-turn then who was in the Toyota making a left hand turn as seen on the surveillance video?
It looks to be two separate incidents. Its clear by the dashboard camera that traffic was a bit busy.
RCMP Surveillance Video of the Shooter
Jump to 1m20sec:
The behavior of the “pedestrians” also seems unusual. They do not appear to be frightened people trying to get away from the shooting at the Memorial. Rather, they appear to be anticipating the shooter's arrival.
To be precise the “pedestrians”, according to RCMP Commission Bob Paulson, were, “…recoiling westward from the incident at the Memorial”. Their recoiling coincidentally matched the exact intention and path the shooter eventually took. What are the chances of this?
The video clearly shows two men on the sidewalk looking back in the direction of the Memorial and another two men in suits crossing the street, walking towards and pausing at the bollards, looking back as if they are waiting for someone/something–quite likely the shooter. The four of them look coordinated. Perhaps they were the shooter' handlers placed to ensure this false flag would unfold as planned.
In addition there were NO other pedestrians around. It seems to be a strange coincidence that two pedestrians would “recoil” from the incident at the Memorial to the exact same spot where Bibeau finally parks his car before he heads towards Central Block of the Parliament buildings and be met with two to other men with the same body language with no other pedestrians nearby.
Exhibit Two
Finally the irrefutable evidence. The one giant hole that sinks this alleged crazed terrorist rampage in downtown Ottawa of any of its buoyancy.
Evan Solomon of the CBC reveals in, to use his words, details of exactly how the incidents went down in Central Block in the Hall of Honor by the library.
Take a look at Google's virtual tour of the Parliament building at the exact spot where Evan Solomon conspicuously states the location of the where the shooter was shot and this is what you get — taken on April 2013. The numbers are beside the bullet holes.
Make no mistake about it: although Calexico is listed first, this is very much an Iron and Wine (i.e., Sam Beam) album. All of the songs were written by Beam, he does the majority of the singing, and his guitar is central throughout. Moreover, the arrangements feel like extensions of his other albums. So, since this is primarily a Sam Beam album, I'm primarily going to discuss it from that point. Essentially, Calexico here functions as a backup band, one that very self-effacingly adapts itself to Beam's compositions. I do intend to revise this review in December after I've been able to see Beam and Calexico live in Chicago at the Congress Theater. My guess is that both will do separate and joint sets.
Sam Beam has been one of the leading lo-fi performers in the US for the past two or three years with the gradual addition of back up musicians on each ensuing album. While part of me is nostalgic for the minimalism of THE CREEK DRANK THE CRADLE, originally demo tapes that consisted of Beam alone with his guitar, another part has been encouraged by how superb his work has been with the addition of other performers. The conversion isn't like Dylan going from acoustic to back up band, in which the music itself seemed to change; Beam's work with other musicians seems a natural extension of his previous work. That being said, I'm not sure that the songwriting here represents a similar leap forward. I thought the songs on the WOMAN KING EP, released earlier this year, even stronger than his previous work. Here all the songs are exquisite, but I can't point to a single one and marvel at how brilliant it is. In short, this is a very fine collection of Sam Beam compositions, but he has done better in the past, and I believe he will do better in the future. The songs here in generally do not show the lyrically complexity of some of his other work. For instance, nothing here shows the astonishing virtuosity of "Jezebel" from WOMAN KING, which updated the Biblical story by apparently viewing Jezebel not just the abomination of the Old Testament, but imbuing her with some of the qualities of the Sirens. The lyrics are always satisfying here, but unlike previous albums, I am never stunned by his remarkable skills as a lyricist.
The first two numbers on the disc are "He Lays the Reins" and "Prison on Route 41." Both are quiet songs with the feel of a traditional folk song. You can almost imagine Johnny Cash deciding to cover either of them. I especially like "Prison on Route 41," a gentle waltz praising Virginia, the woman who has saved the singer from the life of crime and imprisonment that is the fate of his other. "A History of Lovers" is my favorite song on the album, with a much more forceful beat and involvement by the band, a song about a man who kills another man over the love of a woman with in inconstant heart, perhaps even a prostitute, though that is all left a bit vague. "Red Dust" is one of the less compelling numbers on the disc. The final three numbers are all fine, though I especially like "Dead Man's Will," with wonderful yet simple lyrics.
I've said elsewhere that I believe Sam Beam is one of the most intriguing talents in American music, probably the most gifted lyricist working today, and the crafter of a score of utterly marvelous songs. It will be fascinating to see what direction his efforts will lead next. Will he go back to solo work or will he work more with back up bands like he has here with Calexico? So far his work has been thoroughly satisfying either way and I very much hope that he will do both. I'm not sure how fans of Calexico would respond to this album. They are very definitely in the background here. Fans of Sam Beam, however, should find this to be a thoroughly satisfying EP, and will definitely want to get it. Although Beam has not in 2005 released a full length album, he has released two superb EPs. Of the two I would recommend WOMAN KING a tad more strongly than IN THE REINS, only because I think the songwriting is a bit stronger on the former, but both are extremely fine albums.
REDWOOD CITY — A 32-year-old San Bruno woman who lured a 14-year-old boy into her minivan, gave him alcohol and had sex with him was sentenced to eight months in jail Wednesday, a prosecutor said.
Nina Herrera was convicted of unlawful sexual intercourse in August and will have to register as a sex offender, chief deputy district attorney Steve Wagstaffe said. She is supposed to begin serving her sentence Feb. 6, he added.
Prosecutors say Herrera, who has an 11-year-old daughter, went cruising for teenage boys at a San Bruno movie theater in March 2008 and picked up the victim along with some of his friends. She gave the boys alcohol and cigarettes before finally having sex with the victim in her vehicle.
“If this had been a man the issue would not have been if, but how many years in prison,” Wagstaffe said, adding that because society views this type of incident as less serious than ones between men and girls the sentence is accordingly lighter. “The concept of equal punishment for this type of crime doesn't exist in our society at this point.”
Wagstaffe said the crime was reported after one of the boy's friends told his probation officer what happened. Police, posing as the victim, contacted the woman through social networking Web site MySpace, where she admitted to having had sex with the boy, prosecutors said.
After the woman was arrested she told police that she had just gotten out of an abusive 10-year relationship and “needed help.”
Her attorney didn't return telephone calls seeking comment Wednesday.
Herrera is out of custody on a $50,000 bond.
Greenwald in 2007: Journalists "know the work they do ought to be pleasing to the people who sign their paychecks."
Last night brought an amusing (on the face of it) and horrifying (when you think about it) twist in Pando's ongoing coverage of Pierre Omidyar's $250m First Look journalism project.
For those coming to the party late: last week, Mark Ames wrote about how eBay founder Omidyar had co-invested with the US government in several of the opposition groups involved in the Ukraine revolution, a geopolitical closeness with Uncle Sam about which none of his reporters seemed aware.
The piece prompted a fierce, and lengthy, response from First Look staffer Glenn Greenwald. The thrust being that, despite him being an active presence in the company's virtual newsroom, Omidyar's wealth and political opinions couldn't possibly impact First Look's reporting. In fact, Greenwald argued, the accusation barely even warrants a response. (A position, incidentally, that the WaPo's Erik Wemple handily demolished here.)
Wrote Greenwald...
[T]he political ideology of those who fund media outlets, no matter how much you dislike that ideology, does not mean that hard-hitting investigative journalism is precluded or that the journalism reflects the views of those who fund it. Anyone who thinks that The Intercept is or will be some sort of mouthpiece for U.S. foreign policy goals is invited to review the journalism we've produced in the 20 days we've existed...
...But for me, the issue is not – and for a long time has not been – the political views of those who fund journalism. Journalists should be judged by the journalism they produce, not by those who fund the outlets where they do it. The real issue is whether they demand and obtain editorial freedom. We have. But ultimately, the only thing that matters is the journalism we or any other media outlets produce. These are strong words. The politics of media owners don't impact the work their reporters do. Journalists should be judged by the work they do, and nothing else.
And, of course, there's no reason to doubt that Greenwald genuinely believes what he says about his Omidyar background being irrelevant to First Look's reporting. No reason to think that it represents a dramatic change of position, prompted by a desire to keep happy a quarter billion dollar benefactor.
Well.
I say no reason.
Last night, reader Rob Bates sent me this incredible video from 2007, featuring a fresh-faced Glenn Greenwald debating the ethics of media ownership with Politico's Ben Smith. In it we hear a very different, and less well compensated, Greenwald taking Smith to task for the politics and wealth of Politico's owner.
Here are the highlights...
Greenwald ('07): I think it's relevant who owns any journalistic outlet. The reason for that is obvious. The reason is people who work for companies know who signs their paychecks and know the work they do ought to be pleasing to the people who sign their paychecks. I guess, you know, you call it a conspiracy, which is a way to take an issue that's raised and demean it.
Smith: No it's not. Well let me clarify it for you. Am I a dupe, or am I lying?
Greenwald: I don't think either of those things. I'm asking questions. I think that if Rush Limbaugh tomorrow purchased NBC news or if Michael Moore tomorrow purchased the Los Angeles Times, I think everyone across the spectrum would consider that to be an interesting fact, and an important fact to know about that.
[...]
Smith: I just think the details matter, the facts matter, there's a reality underlying it that you can't get from this sort of quickie… It's just such a preposterous way to make arguments, and it's so easy.
Greenwald: ...the point is that [Politico's ownership] is relevant information in the context of everything the Politico has done. I mean, were you aware, for example, that person who signed your contract and signs your paycheck and controls the employer for which you work is a long time Reagan official and has strong ties to the Reagan family. I mean, whether you're able in your super ethical way to bracket that out of your work, but was it something you're aware of or were aware of when you joined the company?”
Smith: I wasn't actually aware of it when I was hired. I met him more recently. He was just the signature on my contract initially.
Greenwald: Uh huh.
Smith: And I am aware of it, although just in both my experience at the company. He runs it… Maybe that's inappropriate, I don't want to, yunno get into discussing things I don't really know about in my company...
Greenwald: I suppose the fact that his fortune is inherited from a family which has longstanding right wing ties might be relevant too. I mean, he could be… that doesn't prove anything about his politics but I think it's relevant.
Smith: Absolutely, but go find some evidence, dig something up that proves it's true… All I can tell you is I have no idea… and that's great.
Greenwald: I give up. I mean, there's never any mathematic proof or evidence standing alone that can even demonstrate that any journalistic outlet has a particular bias or more of a political purpose all you can do is look at the body of evidence.
Smith: …can we move on?
Greenwald: One piece of evidence is the ideological background of the people who own and fund it…
Smith: ….let's move on before you get me fired.
Greenwald: I'm not trying to go person by person but you know I think that you want to make these statements that all the claims about Politico are wild conspiracy theories based on nothing but the person who owns it is a Reagan operative...
Smith: You just said something that isn't true… you know absolutely nothing about my actual boss.
Greenwald: What I know about Politico's structure is what I learned from Mike Allen's article which is that Fred Ryan is it's president and CEO. And CEO is an important position in a company, in general…” Yes, you're reading the above correctly. Greenwald ('07) is making the exact same points about Politico -- and demanding the exact same answers -- that Pando is making and demanding about First Look today. Greenwald ('07) even ridicules Ben Smith for trying to use the same defense as Greenwald ('14) is using today...
I mean, whether you're able in your super ethical way to bracket that out of your work, but was it something you're aware of or were aware of when you joined the company?
Man. Given Greenwald's well-documented habit of smearing and attacking those who disagree with him, I'd hate to be in Greenwald '07 shoes if Greenwald '14 ever sees that video.
I reached out to both Glenn Greenwald (~10hrs ago) and Pierre Omidyar (~2hrs ago) for comment about the contents of the video. Neither had responded at press time. I'll update this post if they do.
Donald Trump has floated a potential third-party run should the GOP run him out of the Republican primary and Ralph Nader, who has his own extensive (and controversial) history with running as a third-party candidate, thinks the Republican Party should take his threats seriously.
"The Republican Party establishment is playing with nitroglycerine when it goes after Donald Trump and tries to minimize him and exclude him," Nader told CNN this week. "Because a jilted Donald Trump as a third-party candidate can blow the presidential race wide open and turn it into a three way race."
Advertisement:
Nader, who's been tagged with the title of "spoiler" over charges that his 2000 Green Party run allowed George W. Bush to prevail over Al Gore, is a four time third-party candidate who argues that Trump has nothing to lose with an independent run. Writing in a blog post last month, Nader argued that Trump's candidacy alone is "a big nightmare for Republican contenders," citing the media attention to sucks up and away from the other 15 contenders:
If he survives the first three months of mass media drubbing him and his notorious affliction of ‘leaving no impulsive opinion behind,' he's going to be trouble for the other fifteen or so Republican presidential candidates. [...] If he is still campaigning by Labor Day, watch out Republicans! [...] If the Republican bigwigs try to exclude or humiliate him, Trump has the means to run as an Independent candidate for president – as Mr. Perot essentially did under the banner of his Reform Party. Just the prospect of that added nightmare might induce caution at the top levels of the GOP.
For his part, Trump appeared to walk back his threats, telling reporters yesterday, "I want to run as a Republican." Trump argued that the best way to beat Hillary Clinton is for the GOP to nominate him as the Republican nominee:
Multiple players have reported experiencing crashes with the Xbox One version, which boots them back to the Xbox Home screen during or after matches, while others have also experienced problems with Battlefield 4: Premium, which doesn't appear to register on certain users' Battlelog profiles.
DICE has promised to resolve issues reported by Xbox One Battlefield 4 players, and offered up a double XP week and "special sidearm scope" as compensation for their troubles.
A bug in the game's save system is also reported to corrupt some users' single-player progress.
"At DICE, we are committed to you, the fans, and view the game as a live service," said the studio's general manager Karl Magnus Troedsson. "I am extremely proud of the people at DICE and everyone across EA that contributed to the development of Battlefield 4. However, I am less proud to see that the game has experienced some turbulence during the launch period. While some platforms have had only minor problems, others have had more than their fair share of issues.
"Resolving the launch issues is our #1 priority. In fact, we are so serious that we have the entire team working to stabilize the game and we will not move on to other projects until we are sure that Battlefield 4 meets - and exceeds - your expectations. It is the right thing to do.
"To show our appreciation for your patience as we work through these issues, we are announcing that from November 28 through December 5, we will reward all players with Double XP for every multiplayer match they complete. We understand that the launch issues may have impacted your progression, and we want to do everything we can to help you get back the XP that you may have lost.
"Also, to cap off the week, on December 5 we will give all players that log in to Battlefield 4 multiplayer a M1911 pistol scope. This special sidearm scope, previously reserved for our DICE developers, has a 3X zoom and is available for all classes in Battlefield 4."
Unfortunately, DICE doesn't offer any indication as to when the issues should be resolved.
The faults with the Xbox One version follow a major issue with the PS4 version, which was reported to prohibit users from playing 64-player games. That issue is expected to have been resolved.

Who were we that we should succeed where so many others failed? Of course, there was something wrong, some dark, evil mystery, or we never should have succeeded!1 —John D. Rockefeller
The Standard Story of Standard Oil
In 1881, The Atlantic magazine published Henry Demarest Lloyd's essay “The Story of a Great Monopoly”—the first in-depth account of one of the most infamous stories in the history of capitalism: the “monopolization” of the oil refining market by the Standard Oil Company and its leader, John D. Rockefeller. “Very few of the forty million people in the United States who burn kerosene,” Lloyd wrote,
know that its production, manufacture, and export, its price at home and abroad, have been controlled for years by a single corporation—the Standard Oil Company. . . . The Standard produces only one fiftieth or sixtieth of our petroleum, but dictates the price of all, and refines nine tenths. This corporation has driven into bankruptcy, or out of business, or into union with itself, all the petroleum refineries of the country except five in New York, and a few of little consequence in Western Pennsylvania. . . . the means by which they achieved monopoly was by conspiracy with the railroads. . . . [Rockefeller] effected secret arrangements with the Pennsylvania, the New York Central, the Erie, and the Atlantic and Great Western. . . . After the Standard had used the rebate to crush out the other refiners, who were its competitors in the purchase of petroleum at the wells, it became the only buyer, and dictated the price. It began by paying more than cost for crude oil, and selling refined oil for less than cost. It has ended by making us pay what it pleases for kerosene. . . .2
Many similar accounts followed Lloyd's—the most definitive being Ida Tarbell's 1904 History of the Standard Oil Company, ranked by a survey of leading journalists as one of the five greatest works of journalism in the 20th century.3 Lloyd's, Tarbell's, and other works differ widely in their depth and details, but all tell the same essential story—one that remains with us to this day.
Prior to Rockefeller's rise to dominance in the early 1870s, the story goes, the oil refining market was highly competitive, with numerous small, enterprising “independent refiners” competing harmoniously with each other so that their customers got kerosene at reasonable prices while they made a nice living. Ida Tarbell presents an inspiring depiction of the early refiners.
Life ran swift and ruddy and joyous in these men. They were still young, most of them under forty, and they looked forward with all the eagerness of the young who have just learned their powers, to years of struggle and development. . . . They would meet their own needs. They would bring the oil refining to the region where it belonged. They would make their towns the most beautiful in the world. There was nothing too good for them, nothing they did not hope and dare.4
“But suddenly,” Tarbell laments, “at the very heyday of this confidence, a big hand [Rockefeller's] reached out from nobody knew where, to steal their conquest and throttle their future. The suddenness and the blackness of the assault on their business stirred to the bottom their manhood and their sense of fair play. . . .”5
Driven by insatiable greed and pursuing his firm's self-interest above all else, the story goes, Rockefeller conspired to obtain an unfair advantage over his competitors through secret, preferential rebate contracts (discounts) with the railroads that shipped oil. By dramatically and unfairly lowering his costs, he slashed prices to the point that he could make a profit while his competitors had to take losses to compete. Sometimes he went even further, engaging in “predatory pricing”: lowering prices so much that Standard took a small, temporary loss (which it could survive given its pile of cash) while his competitors took a bankrupting loss.
These “anticompetitive” practices of rebates and “predatory pricing,” the story continues, forced competitors to sell their operations to Rockefeller—their only alternative to going out of business. It was as if he was holding a gun to their heads—and the “crime” only grew as Rockefeller acquired more and more companies, enabling him, in turn, to extract ever steeper rebates from the railroads, which further enabled him to prey on new competitors with unmatchable prices. This continued until Rockefeller acquired an unchallengeable monopoly in the industry, one with the “power” to banish future competition at will and to dictate prices to suppliers (such as crude oil producers) and consumers, who had no alternative refiner to turn to.
Pick a modern history or economics textbook at random and you are likely to see some variant of the Lloyd/Tarbell narrative being taken for granted. Howard Zinn provides a particularly succinct illustration in his immensely popular textbook A People's History of the United States. Here is his summary of Rockefeller's success in the oil industry: “He bought his first oil refinery in 1862, and by 1870 set up Standard Oil Company of Ohio, made secret agreements with railroads to ship his oil with them if they gave him rebates—discounts—on their prices, and thus drove competitors out of business.”6
Exhibiting the same “everyone knows about the evil Standard Oil monopoly” attitude, popular economist Paul Krugman writes of Standard Oil and other large companies of the late 19th century:
The original “trusts”—monopolies created by merger, such as the Standard Oil trust, or its emulators in the sugar, whiskey, lead, and linseed oil industries, to name a few—were frankly designed to eliminate competition, so that prices could be increased to whatever the traffic would bear. It didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this was bad for consumers and the economy as a whole.7
The standard story of Standard Oil has a standard lesson drawn from it: Rockefeller should never have been permitted to take the destructive, “anticompetitive” actions (rebates, “predatory pricing,” endless combinations) that made it possible for him to acquire and maintain his stranglehold on the market. The near-laissez-faire system of the 19th century accorded him too much economic freedom—the freedom to contract, to combine with other firms, to price, and to associate as he judged in his interest. Unchecked, economic freedom led to Standard's large aggregation of economic power—the power flowing from advantageous contractual arrangements and vast economic resources that enabled it to destroy the economic freedom of its competitors and consumers. This power, we are told, was no different in essence than the political power of government to wield physical force in order to compel individuals against their will. In the free market, through unrestrained voluntary contracts and combinations, Standard had allegedly become the equivalent of a king or dictator with the unchallenged power to forbid competition and legislate prices at whim. “Standard Oil,” writes Ron Chernow, author of the popular Rockefeller biography Titan, “had taught the American public an important but paradoxical lesson: Free markets, if left completely to their own devices can wind up terribly unfree.”8
This lesson was and is the logic behind antitrust law, in which government uses its political power to forcibly stop what it regards as “anticompetitive” uses of economic power. John Sherman, the author of America's first federal antitrust law, the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, likely had Rockefeller in mind when he said:
If we does not endure a king as a political power we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessaries of life. If we would not submit to an emperor, we should not submit to an autocrat of trade, with power to prevent competition, and to fix the price of any commodity.9
But Rockefeller was no autocrat. The standard lesson of Rockefeller's rise is wrong—as is the traditional story of how it happened. Rockefeller did not achieve his success through the destructive, “anticompetitive” tactics attributed to him—nor could he have under economic freedom. Rockefeller had no coercive power to banish competition or to dictate consumer prices. His sole power was his earned economic power—which was no more and no less than his ability to refine crude oil to produce kerosene and other products better, cheaper, and in greater quantity than anyone thought possible.
It has been more than one hundred years since Ida Tarbell published her History of the Standard Oil Company. It is time for Americans to know the real history of that company and to learn its attendant and valuable lessons about capitalism. . . .
X Factor girl group Rhythmix forced to change their name after charity posts open letter to Simon Cowell
It's a catchy name befitting of any funky young girl group with ambitions to top the pop charts.
But unfortunately for X Factor stars Rhythmix, they have been forced to change their moniker as it is already trademarked to a charity.
The four-piece will have to undergo a mid-series name change after the children's music charity wrote an open letter to X Factor boss Simon Cowell.
Excited: The girls hope that fans will like their new moniker
The letter was written by Mark Davyd, chief executive of Rhythmix which is a charity that helps vulnerable young people to create and perform their own music.
Just change the name: The letter from the charity urged Simon Cowell to find a new moniker for the girl group
Davyd claimed that Cowell's company Simco had applied to trademark the name Rhythmix while aware that it was already in use by the charity.
The letter, which was posted on Facebook today, said: ' Rather than seeking any discussion with the Charity, considering any of the moral implications of their actions, or checking with the Charity whether the pursuit of an exclusive trademark might have a negative impact on the activities of the Charity, Simco and their legal representatives apparently sought a way to use the law to circumvent the trademark of the Charity.'
The letter recognised Cowell's charity work and praised it but said the X Factor's decision to use the name threatened the charity's work.
It said: ' Rhythmix the charity has worked with over 40,000 young people in the last twelve years. All of that work is placed at risk by the actions of your company.'
Davyd ended the letter with a simple and blunt request to Cowell that said: ' Just change the name.'
Tonight, X Factor producers issued a statement that said: ' At the request of the charity Rhythmix, the members of the girl group Rhythmix have decided to change their name, a decision which has the support of Syco and TalkbackTHAMES.
Public: The charity posted the letter to Cowell on its Facebook page
' The group's new name will be announced in due course.'
The publication of the letter followed the initiation of a Facebook campaign supporting the charity, which gained over 65,000 followers.
The group urged music fans to download Nirvana's 1991 track Smells Like Teen Spirit this December, thereby ensuring an X Factor contestant would not make Christmas number one.
Same girls: The group have made it clear that they haven't changed, despite their new name
Yeshiva University in New York is awarding a doctorate in Talmud to a woman in an unprecedented move, according to a report by JTA.
Shana Strauch Schick, a 30-year-old New Jersey native currently living in Detroit, successfully defended her dissertation on August 4, 2011, and will formally graduate from YU's Bernard Revel Graduate School of Jewish Studies in September.

“Orthodoxy has long emphasized the value of the study of Talmud,” Schick told JTA in an interview. “But Talmud study, which in yeshivot is the central focus of the religious duty to learn Torah, is still rarely emphasized as a vital part of women's education.”
Schick, who holds a master's degree in Bible from Revel and a bachelor's degree in Judaic studies from YU's Stern College for Women, plans to come to Israel for upcoming academic year, the JTA report said. She will do post-doctoral studies at Bar-Ilan University.
Although Stern College also has a master's program in biblical and Talmudic interpretation, as well as a graduate program for women in advanced Talmudic studies, it does not award doctorates.
Caracas, January 2, 2016 (venezuelanalysis.com) – Venezuela's state oil company, PDVSA, has begun to charge in foreign currency for gas sales along the Venezuela-Colombia border.
As of today, a litre of gasoline is being sold at 1200 Colombian pesos (40 US cents) from gas stations in Ureña in Táchira and Paraguachó in Zulia as part of the pilot venture. Gas is currently sold at around $2400 per litre in the rest of Colombia and 6 bolivars in Venezuela, or just below one cent at the official rate.
The move was announced on December 29 by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who described the measure as a “strike against the mafias” and “an advancement towards a healthy border”.
The Colombian-Venezuela border has been a source of dispute between the two neighbouring countries for the past two years and Caracas has consistently accused the Colombian government of turning a blind eye to paramilitary activity and the smuggling of 100 bolivar bills, subsidised food and fuel out of Venezuelan territory.
The Venezuelan government has said that the new measure is aimed at putting an end to gasoline contraband, which reaches around 980,000 litres a day according to government sources.
In August, the Colombian-Venezuela border was finally re-opened after being closed for a year at Venezuela's behest.
The policy change will also help to offset a loss in foreign currency earnings due to decreased global oil prices in 2016.
WASHINGTON -- Two of President Obama's national campaign co-chairs called on the Democratic Party to endorse marriage equality in its platform on Tuesday. The announcements are notable because Obama, who is also the head of the Democratic Party, still does not support same-sex marriage.
A spokesman for Russ Feingold told The Huffington Post that the former Wisconsin senator would like to see the Democratic Party's platform embrace equality, pointing to his long-time support of same-sex marriage rights.
Feingold, who is the author of the new book "While America Sleeps," first announced his support for marriage equality in 2006 -- a time when very few other elected officials were publicly taking such a stance.
"Denying people this basic American right is the kind of discrimination that has no place in our laws, especially in a progressive state like Wisconsin. The time has come to end this discrimination and the politics of divisiveness that has become part of this issue," Feingold said at the time.
Feingold also voted against Don't Ask, Don't Tell when it first came before the U.S. Senate during the Clinton administration, and he opposed the Defense of Marriage Act.
Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) also said on Tuesday that Democrats need to "stand up for the rights of same-sex couples and their families."
"I call on the Democratic Platform Committee to affirm the freedom to marry in our party's national convention platform this September," Shaheen said in a statement. "Any Democratic statement of core beliefs about the importance of families must include all our families, gay and straight. Our party has a long tradition of leading the charge on important questions of justice."
The push to enshrine marriage equality in the Democratic Party platform is being led by the pro-LGBT rights group Freedom to Marry in the "Democrats: Say I Do" campaign.
The language that Freedom to Marry wants included in the platform states:
We support the full inclusion of all families in the life of our nation, with equal respect, responsibilities, and protections under the law, including the freedom to marry. Government has no business putting barriers in the path of people seeking to care for their family members, particularly in challenging economic times. We support the Respect for Marriage Act and the overturning of the federal so-called Defense of Marriage Act, and oppose discriminatory constitutional amendments and other attempts to deny the freedom to marry to loving and committed same-sex couples.
If adopted, it would be the first time the party's platform has embraced marriage equality. In 2008, the platform stated, "We oppose the Defense of Marriage Act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us," but it did not explicitly call for same-sex marriage.
In 2004, the platform condemned Republican attempts to pass a constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriage, but it also said the decision should be left to the states: "In our country, marriage has been defined at the state level for 200 years, and we believe it should continue to be defined there. We repudiate President Bush's divisive effort to politicize the Constitution by pursuing a 'Federal Marriage Amendment.' Our goal is to bring Americans together, not drive them apart."
The Democratic platform will be ratified at the party's national convention, which begins Sept. 3 in Charlotte, N.C.
White House spokesman Jay Carney recently said Obama continues to "evolve" on the issue.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has also endorsed adding marriage equality to the party platform. When asked at a Feb. 17 press conference about Obama's stance on the issue, Pelosi said, "I hope the evolution continues."
Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa (D), who is also the chairman of the Democratic National Convention, was recently asked about his views on the platform change. He reiterated his strong support for same-sex marriage rights but said he could not "dictate" what goes into the party's platform at the September convention.
So far, more than 20,000 people have signed Freedom to Marry's online petitions.
The Obama administration did not immediately return a request for comment.
Shaheen spokesman Jonathan Lipman said the senator would be more than willing to talk to Obama about her position on the issue.
"I think her personal views are spelled out pretty well in her existing statements. As regards to the President, we've let the campaign know the Senator's position on the platform and Senator Shaheen would welcome the opportunity to discuss it with the President," Lipman said.

Its been ten years since the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) was established. Ten years and $2.5 billion dollars. What do they have to show for it?
Echinacea for colds. Ginkgo biloba for memory. Glucosamine and chondroitin for arthritis. Black cohosh for menopausal hot flashes. Saw palmetto for prostate problems. Shark cartilage for cancer. All proved no better than dummy pills in big studies funded by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. The lone exception: ginger capsules may help chemotherapy nausea.
Senator Tom Harkin, the driving force behind NCCAM, has long been aware of the problem. From the outset, the center was bedeviled by practitioners of evidence-based medicine. The “unbendable rules of randomized clinical trials”, as he described them, proved unforgiving. Harkin lambasted scientists for their resistance to accepting therapies on faith: “It is not necessary for the scientific community to understand the process before the American public can benefit from these therapies.”
Sadly, his valiant defence of alternative medicine from the Armies of The Enlightenment was all in vain. After being described as ‘Tom Harkin's folly' in a New York Times editorial, in 1998, the center was elevated to the status of National Institute of Health center. It was to be run under a mandate of promoting a rigorous and scientific approach to the study of alternative medicine.
The result has been a disappointment to Senator Harkin. He told a Senate hearing in 2009, “One of the purposes of this center was to investigate and validate alternative approaches. Quite frankly, I must say publicly that it has fallen short.” After all, the center has been “disproving things rather than seeking out and approving things.”
I see the problem, Senator. If only scientists had not adhered so rigidly to RCT standards. If only they had been willing to accept other sources of information. In fact, their willingness to disregard folk wisdom and tradition and their privileging of evidence-based medicine is, well, gosh darn it, it's almost fascist. Not all the way fascist. Lets say… microfascist.
As someone far more intellectual than I once wrote, “the evidence-based movement in the health sciences is outrageously exclusionary and dangerously normative with regards to scientific knowledge.” The problem? Scientific research operates inside a post-positivist paradigm that excludes alternative forms of knowledge. I would argue that by refusing to contemplate the experiential, the traditional, the imagined and the anecdotal, the evidence-based movement “acts as a fascist structure”. Indeed, credentialed “scientists”, through their “secular priesthood” hold a monopoly on the production of scientific knowledge.
Senator, by privileging ‘regimes of truth' like evidence-based medicine, the NCCAM has been a good example of microfascism in action. If you want to see your center fulfil its original intention, if you want to see an end to microfascism in the National Institutes of Health, if you want to prevent the elimination of alternative ways of knowing and the reduction of health sciences to the totalitarian ideology of evidence-based medicine, that ‘regimented and institutionalised version of ‘truth”, take back the NCCAM. Alternative medicine can never be integrated with the singular, totalising ideology of evidence-based medicine and its microfascististic worldview.
It is in deconstructivism that the radical singularity of knowledge that is complementary and alternative medicine will find a welcome space of freedom to territorialise and colonise. It is time for CAM to resist the totalitarian program of randomized controlled trials, to decolonise the masculine narratives of large sample sizes and competing hypotheses.
It is time for CAM to embrace postmodernism. And then you can get the results you want.

Atletico Madrid In time for Saturday's match
Atletico Madrid supporters travelling to the Estadio Wanda Metropolitano by car should find it far easier to reach the club's new stadium this weekend, given that the access roads are now completed and ready for use.
The first stage of the road openings will be in place in time for this Saturday's match between Los Rojiblancos and Alaves, with a new one-kilometre-long lane added to the M-40 motorway and with a new exit put in on that same stretch of road.
Vehicles turning off at this exit will be brought straight to the Avenida Luis Aragones, which leads to the stadium.
It should be noted that this motorway exit is not yet permanently opened, and that it will only be opened this Saturday as a trial.
There are further developments to the area's roads still to come, but the completion of the first stage of the project should ease congestion in the area, which will please Atleti fans and locals alike.
Tell the Senate: Fire FCC Chairman Ajit Pai
We are so done with Trump's FCC chairman, Ajit Pai.
To be fair, we were done with him years ago. Since he joined the Commission, he's worked to undo policies designed to protect internet users, communities of color and poor people. While he's supposed to protect the public interest, he's continuously voted against it and sided with the deep-pocketed corporations — like Verizon — that once employed him.
He's failing at his job. And that means we need the Senate to fire him.
And we have an opportunity. The Senate has to vote to reconfirm Pai by the end of the year or he's out.
Here's what that means for us: We can get every single member of the Senate on the record about Net Neutrality and a whole lot more.
Let's be clear: A vote for Pai is a vote to:
End the internet as we know it.
Let Trump's favorite media empire Sinclair (known for its record of racist coverage and anti-Muslim "must-run" broadcasts 1 ) get even more reach and power.
Shut off phone and internet service for people who are struggling.
Not a single senator should support that agenda.
The Senate needs to stand up for what's right and fire FCC Chairman Ajit Pai.

Most teenagers his age would be preparing for college or worrying about getting a date for prom. But 17-year-old Juan "Contractz" Garcia has his mind on League of Legends -- specifically, a League Championship Series title and the Rookie of the Split award. While his friends are picking out caps and gowns, Contractz has already graduated and set his sights on his profession of choice: professional video game player.
"I'm not even sure what I did was the right thing. I would be in my senior year of high school right now if I was still in school. Honestly, I'm not sure if missing my senior year and graduating from high school early is the right thing to do," Contractz said to ESPN.com. "Overall, I think graduating from high school is one of the first priorities before you want to do anything else. And if you're already good enough to go pro, then I'd probably still do it because this is an opportunity you don't get a lot in life."
Back in high school, he lived a fairly normal teenage life: friends, schoolwork, playing video games after school. The only difference is that while others went home and played for fun, Contractz was rising up the League of Legends leaderboards, wowing his friends with how quickly he made it to the Challenger tier, where the top 200 players of each region's server reside. He would play until midnight almost every day, sleep and then go to the school the next day, working toward his future career without noticing it until he started playing in competitive tournaments.
If the age requirement for going pro for the NA LCS were below the current barrier of 17, Contractz probably would have been in the league sooner, playing semi-professionally last year on C9's minor league team. Contractz has been a rare talent in the online North American servers, and teams waited for him to become of age so they could sign him. After helping C9's secondary team, Cloud9 Academy, qualify for the NA LCS this season under the new management and branding FlyQuest, Contractz decided to stay with the C9 organization. He was promoted to starting jungler as his 17th birthday arrived.
Often when players come into the league with buzz surrounding them, their personalities match the hype, with outspoken, challenging players at their position left and right and talking a big game. Contractz, curly-haired with a quiet, friendly demeanor, has been anything but that in his first season. He praises his rivals and appears to take everything in stride. When talking about his ups and downs so far as a rookie, he's introspective, discussing how his performance slipped after a strong start to the season and that he's only now picking his game back up.
Contractz knows that the road to greatness is paved with dips and valleys.
"My mom is really supportive of me," the starting Cloud9 jungler said to ESPN.com. "She watches every single one of my games and congratulates me when I win and picks me back up when I'm down after a loss. Overall, I'm just really glad she's supporting me."
That's who Contractz is. He loves playing the game and is thankful to have the opportunity and family support to make a living out of it. He graduated from high school early to make sure he could go for his dream, and being a realist about the future, he says that if his playing days ever come to a close, college applications could soon come after. Until then, though, becoming the best jungler in the world -- regardless of how long that takes -- is his goal, along with helping C9 regain its spot as North America's best team for the first time in two years.
"I just like practicing every single week," Contractz said. "Scrims every single day. Coming into LCS Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays and playing professional League of Legends. It's just super surreal. I would have never thought ever in high school that I would be playing pro League of Legends for a living. It's just incredible to me."

of gumpaste tools (unfortunately I can't find it sold separately). It works especially well with the large ruffle cutter, just be sure to place the tool's point as close to the center as possible (see picture). To create the frills you gently rock the tool back and forth against the fondant, working your way all the way around the circle. I recommend using a pointed fondant modeling stick for frilling (creating the ridges) and it comes in this nice set of gumpaste tools (unfortunately I can't find it sold separately).

Strawberry Shindig Ruffle Cake
Yield: One 7-inch layer cake
Cake/Icing prep and bake time: 1 hour 30 minutes
Total time with ruffles: All day. Don't plan to do anything else.
Source: cake recipe from Food .com
[click for printable recipe]
It doesn't take an expert fondant artist to make this cake, just a ruffle cutter and some patience. The entire cake is covered in fondant before the ruffles are attached, but since it's completely covered by the ruffles, the undercoating doesn't have to be perfect. Wilton ready-made fondant is the easiest for novice hands to work with, but I suggest Satin Ice brand fondant because it tastes good.
There were many interpretations for Kaylee's dress colors by fans online, ranging from hot pink to tangerine. Since the show was seemingly filmed through a warm filter, I chose colors more in the salmon/watermelon family. Feel free to disregard my color palette and create your own.
Special equipment
Large fondant ruffle/frill cutter
Fondant/gum paste modeling stick
Artists' brush
Cake
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups sugar
3/4 cup strawberry preserves
4 large eggs
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup buttermilk
Pink gel food coloring
1/3 dram bottle LorAnn strawberry flavoring oil
Preheat oven to 350°. Line the bottoms and sides of of two 7-inch cake pans (can also use two 9-inch pans) with parchment paper. Set aside. Sift flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a large bowl; set aside. In a separate large mixing bowl, beat butter and sugar together until light and fluffy (this may take up to 4 minutes to fully incorporate). Add the strawberry preserves and then beat in eggs one at a time. Scrape downsides of bowl and add vanilla extract and enough food coloring to achieve desired color. You may also omit the coloring, but the interior is a much prettier color with the addition of food coloring. Mix in flour alternating with the buttermilk. Begin and end with the flour mixture. Add the flavoring oil, if using. Divide batter equally between the pans Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center of each cake layer comes out clean. Turn cakes out onto a wire rack and peel of the parchment paper. Let cool completely. Torte cakes so there are four layers.
Icing
1 1/2 cups unsalted butter, softened
5 cups confectioners' sugar
4 oz. cream cheese softened and cubed
1/2 dram bottle LorAnn strawberry flavoring oil
Combine butter and confectioners' sugar in a large bowl and mix on low speed until just combined. Switch to high speed and add cream cheese a little at a time. Finally, add the strawberry flavoring oil. Scrape down bowl and mix again on high speed until light and fluffy. Fill cake layers and apply an even crumb coat to the outside of the cake with frosting. Refrigerate until frosting develops a crust, or until ready to cover in fondant.
Fondant cover and ruffles
1 lb. vanilla pale pink ready-made rolled fondant such as Satin Ice brand
1 lb. vanilla white ready-made fondant such as Satin Ice brand
Pink gel food coloring
Golden yellow gel food coloring
Clear vegetable shortening
Meringue powder or dried egg whites reconstituted in water
On a work surface lightly coated with shortening (or powdered sugar) knead well 1/2 lb. white ready-made fondant; reserve the remaining 1/2 lb. for later use (keep air-tight). If there are dry crusty areas on the fondant, knead in a little clear vegetable shortening to soften it, or remove and discard the pieces. Roll piece out with a large fondant roller or rolling pin until the pieces is 1/4” thickness. Roll fondant onto the rolling pin and drape over cake. Smooth down edges and trim with a paring knife or pastry wheel. Place fondant-covered cake on a cake stand or serving plate. Divide the pink fondant in half, tint both portions with pink and yellow gel food colorings, but make sure one color is darker and more pink in color that the other. Roll out the darker pink color fondant and cut a ruffle using the large frill cutter. Remove excess pieces and keep air tight. Frill/ indent fondant piece using the fondant modeling stick. Be sure to place the tool's point as close to the center as possible, then rock the tool back and forth. When you're done frilling, cut the circle between a scallop and gently lay the piece flat. You may find it easiest to cut the large fondant ruffle into 3 smaller pieces, making it easier to place without tearing. Mix the meringue powder or egg whites in a little water and have the artists' brush ready. Hold the fondant ruffle up to the cake to approximate the placement. Apply meringue mixture to the cake with the brush, then press ruffle onto the cake. You can also overlap a little of the ruffle onto itself to create ruffles that stand out. Re-roll fondant scraps and cut out another ruffle piece. Repeat the entire process, continuing with the lighter color fondant and then with the remaining 1/2 lb. white fondant. At the very top, I cut out a 3-inch circle and gently ruffled the edges by pressing with my fingers. An edible gold chocolate button was pressed in the center, but you could omit this or use a scrap piece of colored fondant rolled into a button-shape.
Step #4: "You can also overlap [...] the ruffle onto itself to create ruffles that stand out."

My friend Darla of Bakingdom is having a birthday today!Because I love birthdays - and Darla more so - I want to help celebrate! She's an inspiration to me and I feel that we are, in many ways, kindred spirits. For example...Now, I could list about a dozen more reasons why I love her, but I'll name just one more. She's a fellow browncoat. A Firefly fanatic. And if you don't know what that is, then Darla will tell you all about it here The inspiration for this cake is taken from Kaylee's dress in the "Shindig" episode, and Cap'n Tightpants even calls it a "layer cake" when they are at said fancy shindig. I'd have to agree! It's a confection made of satin, and just as sweet as the person who wears it.This cake is appropriatelythrough-and-through, and there's a gold button on top because, well,This was my first time ever making fondant ruffles. I bought a large ruffle cutter over a year ago, and have never used it until now. I was surprised at how easy it is to make ruffles! The cutter does a good bit of the work for you.When you're done frilling, cut the circle between a scallop and gently lay the piece flat. You may find it easiest to cut the large fondant ruffle into 3 smaller pieces, making it easier to place without tearing. Reconstituted dry egg whites or meringue powder makes a good adhesive with which to adhere the ruffles onto the cake. Apply it to the cake with an artists' brush just before you add a ruffle.The cake gets its strawberry flavor from a generous helping of strawberry preserves. I also kicked it up a notch with some LorAnn strawberry flavoring oil. It's dense texture is ideal for torting, and can stand up to the many layers of fondant ruffles. The frosting is simple American buttercream with a little cream cheese added.In addition to birthdays, I think this cake would be great for any girly-girl party, like bridal showers, sweet-sixteens and spring tea parties - anywhere ruffles are already welcome.Thanks to Tina who arranged this virtual "shindig"!

The Legend of Tarzan: Movie Review
"The Legend of Tarzan" on paper feels off. It is easy to assume that its the prototypical film that people should shun in a heart beat. The movie grabbing onto a well-known fictional character's name recall and the seemingly CGI-driven aesthetic instantly beckons some negativity in any shape or form. But hugely surprising, "The Legend of Tarzan" is actually a compelling watch. It seriously delivered a deep look into the life, the psyche, the legend and the man that is Tarzan.
In the late 1800s, the Congo was partitioned to the Belgians. King Leopold II of Belgium is about to go bankrupt and desperately needs to look for riches fast. He entrusts Captain Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) to find him mythical diamonds right in the heart of the Congo which he does but with a huge catch - he must bring Tarzan to an African chief who protects said diamonds. It has been years since the man once known as Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgård) left the jungles of Africa behind for a gentrified life as John Clayton III, Lord Greystoke, with his beloved wife, Jane (Margot Robbie) at his side. He has been invited back to the Congo to serve as a trade emissary of Parliament, unaware that he is a pawn in a deadly convergence of greed and revenge, masterminded by Captain Rom. But Rom doesn't know that he is about to unleash the man and the force behind the stories and the legends.
Let's get straight to the point - "The Legend of Tarzan" is not perfect but it is also not as bad as you might expect it to be. The outcome was actually way better than expected. The plot was simple but had a healthy dose of intrigue and injections of backstory to how Tarzan was "adopted" by Great Apes and how he and Jane eventually met made sure that it had our attention from start to finish. We also loved how the movie explored the inner workings of Tarzan's mind especially now that he has had a taste of civilized life. It's a good contrast to when he was still in the jungle and until the turning point where he was taken back to humans. The visuals itself were mostly great and realistic. At times, we found ourselves terrified especially with the Great Apes - that's how effective it was - while the greyish tone of the film was a little bit too dull and dark for our taste. Finally, the cast was okay. Christoph Waltz delivers as a villain while Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgård delivers well as the leads. The only major gripe we had was with the obvious miscast of Samuel L. Jackson as George Williams. We just couldn't gel with his character and the comic relief vibe of his character just felt off for a very serious film. Overall, "The Legend of Tarzan" has its quirks and it has that formulaic instances that holds it back. But when it explores and dares to be creative, the scenes and the characters shine and luckily, the film is mostly that.
Rating: 3 and a half reelsWhy you should watch it:- the film is a deeper look into a character most of us have never taken too seriously- visuals were stunning and terrifyingly goodWhy you shouldn't watch it:- Samual L. Jackson was miscast for sure
WASHINGTON: The United States is exploring an option that could pave the way for a civil nuclear deal with Pakistan like the one concluded with India in 2005, says a report published in The Washington Post on Wednesday.
“The issue is being discussed quietly in the run-up to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's visit to Washington on Oct 22,” said leading columnist David Ignatius in an article he wrote for the Post.
“We are in regular contact with the government of Pakistan on a range of issues as we prepare for the prime minister's visit,” a US government spokesperson told Dawn when asked for comments on the report. “We'll decline comment on the specifics of these discussions,” she added.

The spokesperson also said that the United States “urges all nuclear-capable states, including Pakistan, to exercise restraint” regarding nuclear weapons and missile capabilities.
“We encourage efforts to strengthen safety and security measures and continue to hold regular discussions with Pakistan on a range of global issues, including nuclear security, counter-terrorism, and international norms,” she said.
Pakistan's Ambassador in Washington, Jalil Abbas Jilani, emphasised the “defensive” nature of his country's nuclear programme when asked for comments on the Post report.
“Pakistan's nuclear programme is determined by our legitimate security concerns and Pakistan would never compromise on its national security,” he told Dawn.
“Pakistan's nuclear programme is for defensive purposes only.”
The Post report claimed that the proposed deal could place new limits and controls on Pakistan's nuclear arsenal in return for “a version of the civil nuclear deal”.
The move is part of fresh efforts by the White House to reduce tensions and violence in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Mr Ignatius said the proposed nuclear accord with Pakistan was a “diplomatic blockbuster” that would place “possible new limits and controls on Pakistan's nuclear weapons and delivery systems.”
It “might eventually open a path towards a Pakistani version of the civil nuclear deal that was launched with India in 2005”, he wrote.
A source familiar with the talks told Mr Ignatius that Pakistan “had been asked to consider what are described as ‘brackets'. Pakistan would agree to restrict its nuclear programme to weapons and delivery systems that are appropriate to its actual defence needs against India's nuclear threat”, the article said.
“Pakistan might agree not to deploy missiles capable of reaching beyond a certain range, for example,” it said.
In return, the US “might support an eventual waiver for Pakistan by the 48-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group”.
It was the United States that persuaded the NSG to exempt India from the rules that banned nuclear trade with countries that had not signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
The civil nuclear deal allowed India to join an exclusive club of nuclear powers in exchange for applying International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards to its civilian programme.
Mr Ignatius wrote: “Pakistan prizes its nuclear programme, so negotiations would be slow and difficult, and it's not clear that Islamabad would be willing to accept the limitations that would be required.”
Any progress would break a stalemate that has existed since the US detected Pakistan's nuclear programme in the mid-1980s, and especially after Pakistan exploded its first weapon in 1998.
Pakistan has repeatedly sought a civil nuclear deal on the lines of the one given to India, describing the current US policy as discriminatory.
The United States argued that it could not make a similar deal with Pakistan because the former head of its atomic programme, Dr. A. Q, Khan sold nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea.
Mr Ignatius also wrote that the pace of negotiations aimed at tackling the violence in Afghanistan has quickened “thanks to an unlikely US diplomatic partnership with China”.
“A senior administration official said on Monday that ‘we're hopeful that there will be a willingness on the part of the Taliban to resume negotiations,' despite the intense fighting in Kunduz and elsewhere. Beijing's involvement is a ‘new dynamic' and shows an instance where ‘US interests overlap with those of China',” Mr Ignatius wrote.
The article claimed that since 2011, US State Department officials had been conducting secret peace talks with the Taliban. This is because they recognised that the best way out of the Afghanistan conflict would be a diplomatic settlement with “the Taliban and its sometime sponsors in Pakistan,” the article said.

Mr. Bratton described the shift in internal discipline as part of a broader push to change police culture. By breaking with his predecessor's harder line on low-level misbehavior, he said, he hopes to change officers' attitudes about their jobs and, in the process, their attitudes about the people and neighborhoods they serve.
“I'm practicing community policing on the cops,” he said in an interview about his effort to reshape how the department polices itself.
For Mr. Bratton, the new approach is a key test of his second stint as New York's police commissioner, which began in the shadow of the stop-and-frisk practices employed during the Bloomberg administration. It comes at a time when police departments across the country are under pressure to address the anger and frustration that have fueled antipolice protests for over a year, feelings that were stirred again by the arrest of Mr. Blake, who is biracial, by a white plainclothes officer, James Frascatore.
But treating officers differently does not guarantee they will treat civilians differently, and shifting to a more discretionary system of discipline presents risks. Many past police corruption scandals grew out of a culture that was more tolerant of officers' misdeeds, and some students of that history say strict supervision and consistent enforcement are essential to deterring serious graft.
“If the rule makes sense, then the rule should be there and be applied to everyone,” said Milton Mollen, a former state appellate judge who led a commission that investigated police corruption in New York in the 1990s.
A ‘White Socks' Problem
Like police commissioners before him, Mr. Bratton is facing high-profile, high-stakes disciplinary matters. Before Mr. Blake's arrest, by an officer with a history of civilian complaints, the commissioner was already weighing the actions of officers and supervisors involved in the fatal encounter with Eric Garner on Staten Island in July 2014. And this summer, 19 officers in the Bronx were accused of downgrading criminal complaints, to make crime levels in their precinct appear lower than they actually were.
History has shown Mr. Bratton to be a tough disciplinarian in serious cases. Many officers still recall his retiring of the badge numbers of officers swept up in the “Dirty 30” scandal of the early 1990s.
Our goal is to ensure that each Xplornet customer receives fair and consistent access to the Internet. Bandwidth (the amount of data that can be transmitted and received) is shared among everyone who is connected to the network. Peer-to-peer applications, video streaming and large file downloads can disproportionately use up that bandwidth. If this happens, it can crowd out web browsing, email and other types of web traffic. Traffic management helps to ensure that all of our customers receive a good online experience.
Xplornet's Internet Traffic Management Policies are described below. While these policies may affect the transfer speed of certain traffic in certain circumstances, these policies will not cause your transfer speed to fall below 100 kbps.
Traffic management policies in effect may change in the event of maintenance, testing, outages or unforeseen network-impacting events.
Application Balancing
On your service there is an application balancing policy which operates any time network congestion is detected. This dynamic policy responds to congestion in a part of the network when bandwidth of all customers using the network resource at that time has reached the service capacity of that resource. For example, the policy works to leave resources open for data applications such as voice calling or web browsing that could be crowded out entirely by a large data-intensive download during a congested period. This approach allows more customers to continue their online activities and reduces the impact of data intensive applications on light data applications during congested periods.
To minimize the effects of congestion on certain types of applications, our systems assign applications to one of four categories:
Category Application Type One Voice calling (Voice over IP) Domain Name System (DNS) and network management The Least impacted by congestion Two Web browsing Social networking Online Gaming Three All traffic types not assigned to categorize one, two or four which includes among other types: web video, video streaming and most encrypted traffic Four App downloads and software updates Cloud storage and backup services File transfer applications Peer-to-peer file sharing applications Newsgroup/Usenet Most impacted by congestion
What this means: At busy times, we work to ensure that a good experience is maintained for Internet phone calls, web browsing and social networking.

13-Year-Old In Pakistan Asks For Hard-Earned Salary, Gets His Hand Chopped Off Instead
13-Year-Old In Pakistan Asks For Hard-Earned Salary, Gets His Hand Chopped Off Instead
In a utopian world, there's won't be any child labour, only kids learning how to play, learn and enjoy life.
pclpf
But this isn't utopia, and mankind isn't left with any angels. In what will shock the bejesus out of you, a 13-year-old boy in Pakistan had to pay a frightful price for asking for his salary.
The incident happened in Pakistan's Punjab, in Sheikhupura village, some 50 kilometres from Lahore, where the right hand of this 13-year-old was mercilessly chopped with a fodder cutting machine for demanding the salary.

Jannat Bibi, the boy's mother claimed that Irfan used to work for Shafqat Bibi, for a salary of Rs 3,000.
But Shafqat did not find him laborious enough for the period he was working for her, and when he demanded that he be paid, she cut his hand in anger.
The boy has now been shifted to a local hospital and the police have registered a case against the people involved.
Reuters
The incident is wrong on many levels. To begin with, a child of that age should not be working at all and the government in the area must ensure that.
Secondly, let's accept for a minute that he was, in order to make ends meet, but what he faced was an absolute disregard of humans rights.

Night skiing is for chumps. Unless, of course, you're wrapped head to toe in a custom suit embedded with LEDs, while jumping off cliffs in a remote part of Canada. Then it's art.
That's the surreal basis for the Lightsuit Segment in Sweetgrass Productions' latest ski movie, "Afterglow." Filmed in collaboration with Swedish ad agency Ahlstrand & Wållgren and Philips TV, the three-minute flick, which producers say took "a national government's worth of logistics, planning, and civil engineering" to pull off, is absolutely mesmerizing.
We caught up with one of the film's directors, Nick Waggoner, for some insight into the Lightsuit Segment and its unique tribute to the inner light we find in the deep woods on a dark night.
So, how'd you come up with the idea for the light suit segment?
Nick Waggoner: The LED suit was a product of our collaboration with Swedish agency Ahlstrand and Wållgren and Philips TV. It was this visceral way to represent their new Ambilight TV and its style of glowing color and light. The world of skiing and snow happened to be the perfect way to show that off, so it perfectly paired with what we wanted to do with a night skiing segment -- to bring a totally new aesthetic to skiing.
How'd you pull off the segment technically? (Did the skiers have massive battery packs in their jackets? How'd you affix the rope lights to the skiers? And are those massive tinted spotlights I see in the distance?)
NW: The technical production of the segment involved a MASSIVE amount of energy, 5 weeks of filming, 9,000 lbs of equipment, operating 70 miles from a road at times, in temperatures as cold as -15 in the deepest snow on earth.
It was definitely a logistical nightmare, but one tamed by our 14-person crew to produce what you see here. From Zac Ramras and Max Santeusanio working on the details of production to controlling the camera on the aerial cinematography, all the way to our lighting team, it was a disgustingly big effort. We [pored] over crazy lens diagrams for lights, read over their photometric charts and electrical currents for months, and finally came up with a system that involved 8 main lights, 8 generators, 16-20 light stands, miles of extension chords, colored filters, and a heap more of support equipment.
We topped that off with an optacopter carrying the weight of a Red Epic Camera slung on a Movi Stabilization system. If it sounds high-tech, that's because it is. Yet despite the complexity, like I said, our team worked so hard to make it feel as smooth as it could. Each night would kind of flip-flop, and after awhile, you kind of came to expect that if you were having a great night, that everything imaginable would go wrong the next night. I think filmmaking is often like that— as soon as you celebrate your victories the medium is there to put you back in your place as a small little pea in a frozen bag of vegetables at the back corner of a fallen-on-hard-times small town grocery store. During the graveyard shift. In winter.
The LED suits themselves were custom manufactured. Zac and Max, our two main producers, worked closely with a LED guru to build the suits out. It involved getting the clothes direct from Patagonia and Arc'Teryx, then sewing thousands of tiny LEDS into each article of gore-tex, and then wiring it with a battery the size of a candy bar. We had no idea if they'd even work, and it was an electric feeling when Pep Fujas dropped into a line and came over the first roll radiating blue. We all screamed over the radios, in awe, and Pep was chained to the suit pretty much the rest of the trip. It wasn't all roses and rainbows though. Max and Zac were constantly running into the lodge to solder loose wires and fix broken elements of the suit at 4 a.m. to get it back out into the field.
So given all that massive energy input, did you do anything to mitigate your environmental impact?
NW: In spite of what seems like a massive fossil fuel burn, our daily routine was entirely human-powered, carrying 100-pound rigs and heavy weight lights up and down through the deep snow across long distances. While at Golden Alpine Holidays, all our power and batteries were charged off their micro hydro system, which generates electricity off a high alpine stream that flows deep underneath the snow. In addition, when we're at a location like a backcountry lodge, we take out all cars and are literally skiing out the back door.
Any incidents with skiers having trouble seeing where they were going? I imagine dropping off a cliff at night is an entirely different creature than during the day.
NW: The biggest issue with the LED suits is that they'd act like headlights in fog anytime the skiers kicked up snow, essentially on every turn. We had perfect conditions up at Golden Alpine Holidays, so it was tricky to balance all the snow moving in the air, which produces the best images, with visibility for the athletes. Guys like Pep Fujas, Eric Hjorleifson, Chris Benchetler, and Daron Rahlves are so skilled, I sense that they could ski a lot of these lines blindfolded. Their ability to react and turn and readjust in an instant is incredible and the reason they're some of the most iconic skiers in the sport.
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
This is a shocking stat, but is absolutely true, and to prove it I want to show you the maths…
It all started when I received this tweet from @benwatford86
@MartinSLewis America has reached a total national debt of 14.3 trillion. They only asked Wonga for £200.”
It was meant as a joke, but it then occurred to me to try to do the maths and see how long it would actually take to reach that amount .
The maths behind it
The payday loan company has a 4,214% representative APR. That means if you were able to borrow money from it, without repaying for a year, you'd owe just over 42 times the original amount.
Now at this point, I need point out this shocking stat which bears little resemblence to reality. You CANNOT borrow for a year with Wonga, its a short term lender. In fact the APR is a pretty irrelevant stat when it comes to payday loans in general (see below for why) and Wonga specifically (as it doesn't compound its daily rate) so do take this with a lump of salt.
Yet the numbers are too salacious to avoid doing. If you could get a loan term loan at this rate, and it compounded over a longer period, here's what'd happen…
Borrow £100 and make no repayments After 1 year Owe £4,200 After 2 years Owe £180,000 After 3 years Owe £7,500,000 (£7 million) After 4 years Owe £315,000,000 (£315 million) After 5 years Owe £13,000,000,000 (£13 billion) After 6 years Owe £557,000,000,000 (£557 billion) After 7 years Owe £23,500,000,000,000 (£23.5 trillion)
In other words, in less than six years you'd owe more than the entire US national debt (which is just £10 trillion so less than half).
Why APRs are bonkers for payday loans
These loans are short term loans usually lent for weeks or a couple of months (with Wonga its 31 days capped – hence why I title this ‘at Wongas APR' not ‘borrowing from Wonga'), not years, and for small amounts.
Over a short term APRs are often irrelevant, after all if you borrowed £20 and paid someone back and bought them a pint (£3) the next week, that sounds pretty reasonable. Yet if you were to take it as a loan, and compound it, it'd signify a 143,000% APR – far more than Wonga's APR.
This is a problem as it means the cost of lending simply isn't transparent from the APR (see Should we worry more about 10% interest than 2,000%) and why I don't favour capping interest rates, but think its the total cost of borrowing we need to regulate.
The real reason payday loans can be so dangerous
Yet just because the calculations above isn't realistic, it is important.
The reason for doing this shocking illustration is that what really frightens me about the payday lending as a whole is it's so easy, it can be done without thought and on impulse – just by the click of a mouse. So any form of shock tactic is a good one.
In a controlled environment over a short period, payday lending can meet an unfortunate need, and are certainly better than illegal loan sharks – and sometimes far cheaper than bank charges.
Yet the real worry is some companies let these debts roll over (ie, a lender says "don't pay us back now, keep the cash, we'll just add it on",) and its then that compound interest really does start to hit – even if just extending over just a few weeks. Even if companies don't allow roll over, people still end up using one payday lender to pay off another – effectively rolling over.
Hopefully letting people see a little bit of hyperbole about the sexiest brand in the industry – may make them think twice before getting payday borrowing.
It's another reason I hope people sign the get financial education on the curriculum petition to the PM.
PS. One of the first responses on my facebook page to this blog was the following – which is exactly why I wrote it, “My 18 year old daughter borrowed £76 from a payday lender she now owes £900…they make it too easy 4 kids 2 get in2 debt!! Should raise the age 2 at least 21!!”

So, you have been watching the Olympics?
LANDON DONOVAN: Yeah, I'm a big fan. Any event that has Americans in it, I'll watch. I mean, I found myself watching archery and badminton and shooting the other day. I would never watch that stuff otherwise.
ESQ: Is Phelps the greatest Olympian of all time, for your money?
LD: Obviously the medals record stands for itself. I'm not that old to remember some of the all-time Olympians, but it's hard to imagine a better Olympic athlete. And it's crazy to think the guy's only 27 years old.
ESQ: With the men's Olympic soccer, it's mainly under-23 guys. Are there a couple of players we should really watch in the second half of the Games here?
LD: Well, we played against the Brazilian team a couple months ago. And they're building toward the World Cup in 2014, so they're basically keeping this young group of players together through this whole process. There's a kid, Danilo, who plays; there's a forward named Damião who's very good. The Mexican team, I think, is very good — there's a kid who's been around for a while, Giovanni dos Santos, and as they get later into the tournament he can do some really special things.
ESQ: What do you think about Neymar for Brazil? Pelé has said he's better than Lionel Messi.
LD: I played against him a couple months ago, and I think about two minutes into the game I found myself sort of defending him. And I'm not a defender, but he made me look pretty stupid and just dribbled by me pretty quickly, so that kind of sold me on him.
ESQ: He's done that to a lot of guys, it looks like.
LD: Yeah, that's why I don't feel bad.
ESQ: Do you like that system for the men for the Olympics – under-23 players plus three over-23 guys?
LD: I think I do. Otherwise it just simulates the World Cup. It's kind of nice to have some players that people don't know.
ESQ: There's been some talk that men's Olympic basketball will move to that format as well. Think that's a good idea?
LD: Well, that surprises me a little bit because they don't have a – well, I guess they have a world championship – but they don't have a World Cup that's as significant as our World Cup is. So it would be sort of disappointing for these NBA guys – not only American NBA guys, but foreign NBA guys – who want a chance to play in the Olympics. That would be pretty disappointing because they don't get a chance really to play with their national team in the way that we do.
ESQ: Well, there's also been some talk about a straight-up basketball World Cup.
LD: That would be a great idea. I would be for all sports doing it. It globalizes the game. And I think if you ask the NBA or Major League Baseball or the NHL or the NFL, having their brand more well-known around the world is a big positive. I mean, I've never met anybody who says they don't like the World Cup. If you're a soccer fan or not, everybody loves watching it, and I think it could be the same for other sports.
ESQ: You don't think it might water down the name "World Cup" for you guys?
LD: Well, maybe they could use a different name then. I just think it's cool.
ESQ: What's your take on the Hope Solo thing? She had some pretty harsh tweets for color commentator Brandi Chastain.
LD: Well, I've known Hope pretty well over the last few years, and you have to remember that, in this environment, these are your family members. So if you can imagine someone on TV talking poorly about one of your family members, you'd probably react similarly. Now, it doesn't mean that we all agree with what she did or the way she did it, but she's sticking up for her family. I also know Brandi very well, and she does a good job of not being too harsh, but I can also understand why Hope would take it that way. Sometimes things get a little blown out of proportion when you do things publicly.
ESQ: So tell me about this Gatorade "Beat the Heat" campaign you're a spokesperson for. Is this the kind of thing that would help all those 300-pound NFL guys going through training camp right now?
LD: Yeah. Unfortunately, I think there's not enough education about hydration. When I was young, we knew nothing about it. We all know that there are cases of athletes having serious issues because of dehydration and even dying. And I think Gatorade's done a good job of bringing together some of us who are very passionate about this and allowing us to speak about it and hopefully educate people on the importance of staying hydrated, especially during the summer months where it gets pretty nasty, whether you're young or a professional.
ESQ: You and your LA Galaxy teammates have got a big friendly against Real Madrid tonight. You guys gonna take 'em?
LD: [Laughs] Well, there's a little discrepancy in the values of the players. They're worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and we're not quite there. I think there are realities, but our guys are really excited about it.
ESQ: You mentioned the discrepancy, financially. How big or small is that gap, talent-wise?
LD: Well, it's hard to quantify, right? These are guys that have played at the absolute highest level most of their life. I mean, I watched the USA basketball team play Tunisia the other day, and there are massive differences. They're not as athletic, they don't run as well, they don't shoot as well, they don't handle the basketball as well, they don't pass as well. Now, I wouldn't compare us to Tunisia. I think we have a little better chance than that, but there's a reason that the Real Madrid players are playing for Real Madrid.
ESQ: That Tunisian player who asked Kobe Bryant to sign his shoe after the game – have you ever experienced anything like that, one way or the other?
LD: Well, I've never asked a player if they would sign my shoe. I've certainly had players come up, even before the game has started, and say, "Hey, after the game, can we trade jerseys?" It's kind of like, "Well, let's get through the game first and we'll deal with that later."
ESQ: I imagine there's already a little talk among Galaxy players about who's going to trade jerseys with Cristiano Ronaldo.
LD: My guess is that if David Beckham wants Ronaldo's jersey, he's going to get it.

refreshing cod game
Really like the exosuit movement adds something to a franchise that apparently most thought was getting stale. And yet still most didnt like it, this cod just like cod ghosts before are very cheap in price and online community is a bit scarce compared to black ops 2 and 3. single player is very good campaign with great cinematic rush and action the story and characters were well voiced and motion captured. The plot is interesting but i felt the antagonist was predictable. This cod game is the first to start the future movement idea. besides that its also the first to add supply drops. You can buy with real money advanced drops that give you better weapons variants or camo's or equipment's to wear. You can play normally and get supply drops anyway but it should be noted that there is a lottery type system to the game. The gun variety isn't as good as cod ghosts so expect to see 2-3 type of guns every player uses. Its the most fun cod game just on the basis that the action is chaotic always its the twitchiest I'd say of all the cod's because the movement style is very rushy not very camp. Its the complete opposite of cod ghosts map and action flow. Very little camping unless the game is defense heavy that of course is obvious.Read full review

In 1914, a Canadian veterinarian on his way to treat World War I battlefield horses got off his train on a platform in White River, Ontario, and saw a bear cub. Actually, it was a bear cub tied to a string, held by a trapper. Against his better judgement, the vet bought the bear for $20 and re-boarded the train.
(Courtesy Mattick Family)
He named the bear Winnie, after his native Winnipeg, and continued to the east coast of Canada, where he boarded a ship — with Winnie and his new regiment — to England.
The bear stayed with him, becoming a regiment mascot, through months of battlefield training in miserable weather. But when the time came to deploy to France, he realized that Winnie would not be safe. He brought her to the London Zoo, which agreed to care for Winnie for the duration of the war.
That real-life bear, represented in statues in London and Winnipeg, as well as in historical photos and documents, is the one now known as Winnie the Pooh. And as readers find out in Canadian author Lindsay Mattick's new picture book "Finding Winnie: The True Story of the World's Most Famous Bear," there really was a Christopher Robin too! Mattick, it turns out, is the great grand-daughter of that Canadian veterinarian and knew her family's story needed to be told.
“At some point, I knew I was going to have a child and I thought, there was no better way to explain to them this amazing family story than to do it as a picture book," Mattick tells Here & Now's Robin Young. "And so when I found out I was pregnant a few years ago, I basically had this nine month kind of deadline to take my first crack at writing a picture book.”
Book Excerpt: Finding Winnie
By Lindsay Mattick with illustrations by Sophie Blackall
Winnie was in the army now. Harry taught her to stand up straight and hold her head high and turn this way and that, just so!
Soon, she was assigned her own post. Even the Colonel agreed that Winnie was a Remarkable Bear. She might have been the best navigator in the whole army.
If you hid something, could she find it? She could! What if it was father away? And farther still? “Remarkable!” he cried.

QPR manager Harry Redknapp says he isn't sure whether he will be signing West Ham striker Mauro Zarate.
Earlier this week, it seemed almost certain that West Ham United striker Mauro Zarate would be joining Queens Park Rangers.
The 27-year-old, who joined the Hammers in the summer from Velez Sarsfield, has started just five games, and is set for the exit after a stunning bust-up with manager Sam Allardyce.
Zarate, who reportedly completed a medical with QPR last week, launched a stinging attack on manager Allardyce, saying that 'Big Sam' had been disrespectful for not playing him in the first team more often.
Allardyce responded just a day later, saying that the Argentine-turned-Chilean simply wasn't good enough to get in the Hammers starting XI ahead of the likes of Andy Carroll, Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia.
A deal with QPR seemed like a formality, but speaking after QPR's 1-1 draw with Swansea City on New Year's Day, manager Harry Redknapp wasn't quite so confident.
"I'm not sure," he said. "We'll wait and see what happens. We'll have to look at it and see where we go."
Redknapp was then asked on whether he thought Zarate would eventually join the R's, and he again responded with; "Maybe. I'm not sure."
It's strange for Redknapp to be so unsure on the move just days after reports suggested that Zarate had completed a medical and would sign a six-month loan deal at Loftus Road - and maybe the war of words with Allardyce has put him off.
That could work two-fold; Zarate's petulant attitude to being left out of the side could be a huge concern for Redknapp, whilst Allardyce's claims that Zarate just wasn't good enough will also set alarm bells ringing for Redknapp.
This is a situation to monitor, but make no mistake - Zarate won't be at Upton Park for long given his public spat with his own manager Allardyce, and whether it's QPR or another team, he'll be heading out of East London this month.
Front row at the Victoria's Secret show 2011
After months of preparation, weeks of diet and exercise tips from the Angels and fittings galore, the $12million Victoria's Secret fashion show is finally here.

What the Victoria's Secret show actually is, remains a mystery. Is it costume theatre, burlesque, runway show, soft-porn or music concert - part panto, even?
Last night's show, the 16th annual event for the high street lingerie powerhouse, offered no hard clues. What is certain, though, is that it's the company's marketing juggernaut. There is a reason the executives put on a show that costs $12million to produce, and it's not just for the fun of it.
See the Victoria's Secret fashion show
"It's Showtime" was the theme of this year's pageant, divided into six vignettes. Kanye West performed and he introduced a surprise appearance and performance by Jay-Z. The two hip-hop stars sang as top models Adriana Lima, Karlie Kloss (her first time in the show) and Erin Heatherton strutted up and down the silver glitter catwalk dressed as supermodel superheroes.
Victoria's Secret Angels over the years
Unlike most fashion week runway shows, where dour faced models tend to walk passionlessly up and down so as not to distract from the clothes, here the models are encouraged to wink, wave, blow kisses and whoop up the crowd. At the end of the runway, there is more winking, wiggling - and at one point Joan Smalls pulled the rip-cord on her costume and a silver parachute inflated around her shoulders. Alessandra Ambrosio wore gold-plated wings that weighed 22lbs and were decorated with 105,000 Swarovski crystals.
What does it take to be a Victoria's Secret Angel?
Orlando Bloom, in the front row, stood to cheer and clap his wife Miranda Kerr's appearance in a Victoria's Secret "Very Sexy" bra and knickers accessorised with a custom-made silk wrap and tutu. The designers had commissioned red ballet style shoes with ribbons criss-crossed up the models' legs. Kerr's came undone and she left the runway with ribbons trailing behind her.

Maroon 5 performed their current single "Moves Like Jagger" during the "Angels Aquatic" themed portion of the show. Adam Levine hammed it up on the runway, cooing at his model girlfriend Anne Vyalitsyna and then held her hand as she walked the runway. Carine Roitfeld, Julia Restoin-Roitfeld and Patrick Demarchelier cheered and danced in the front row.
Straight men at fashion shows are a rarity, but last night they were out in full force. Self-respecting fashion people do not greet each other with the words, "What's up, dude" but junior Wall Street bankers in conservative suits do. The crowd was full of aspiring Gordon Gekkos.

The booming voice announcing the start of the show called it "an unforgettable entertainment experience... with the world's most beautiful women and the hottest musical acts." In all the hype, it's easy to forget this is a company that began by simply selling bras and knickers.
A smash and grab robbery prompts chaos and confusion at 12 Oaks Mall in Novi, when investigators say shoppers mistook the sound of breaking glass for gunshots.
Police from Novi and neighboring departments were at the mall, and secured the exits.
Sources are telling 7 Action News that there was a smash and grab robbery at the Tapper's jewelry store.
"The actual sound of the hammer hitting the glass inside the jewelry store sometimes it's a loud bang it might sound like a gun shot," said Sgt. Brian Woloski with the Novi Police Department.
The suspects used a hammer to break the glass at the store and made off with an unknown amount of items. Social media accounts indicate the sound of the breaking glass sounded like gunshots.
Video on Twitter shows the chaos following the incident.
Once again, it is important to note police are saying this was a smash and grab robbery and no gunshots were fired.
Novi investigators say the social media accounts of the incident may have also continued to stir the panic.
"I just think the public is at a heightened level regarding certain incidents that are occurring through our country, maybe people are scared, they believe what they hear or elaborate or maybe a small rumor," said Woloski.
The mall has released the following statement about the situation:
We can confirm there was an attempted smash and grab robbery at Twelve Oaks Mall. Police confirmed that there were no shots fired at any time. The sound of breaking glass was mistaken for gunfire. We take this incident very seriously and are fully cooperating with police. The safety and security of our shoppers and diners is our first priority. Out of an abundance of caution, we are increasing security patrols. For more information on the incident, please contact Novi police as this remains an active investigation.
Sources say police are looking for three African American men who may be driving a gold Chrysler 200.
The suspects are believed to be part of a known crime ring in southeast Michigan.
Novi police say the same suspects may have cased a jewelry store in Grosse Pointe just days ago.
Jack Nicholson nailed it. That condescending smile that just puts the fear of death in you so deep you feel it kicking around in your spleen. The iconic smile, the one shoved through an axe-wound in a door, with an implied “Heeeeeeeeeeeere's Johnny!”. When he hobbles upstairs, grinning that Joker-grin, forcing through clenched teeth,
Wendy? Darling? Light, of my life. I'm not gonna hurt ya. You didn't let me finish my sentence. I said, I'm not gonna hurt ya. I'm just going to bash your brains in.
He's smiling. He's grinning. But he's deadly.
It's how I imagine some of the theists look, when they approach me on Twitter or Facebook with their ridiculous assumptions. I'm ashamed to admit, this is the one thing that gets under my skin. I often have people on Twitter ask me how I can have so much patience with religious trolls. I just do. I just don't take seriously what they're saying to me… until they assume. Especially if they assume something about the people I love. That's when GM gets pissed.
Here are just a small handful of those assumptions:
“You believe there is no God”
No. To be honest, I have no belief about God one way or the other. I think the entire fucking idea of God is silly. I am, on a daily basis, floored that people not only take this idea seriously, but also fully believe it and live their lives in line with this belief. It is, to me, precisely the same as entertaining the idea that elves make Christmas presents at the North Pole. It's neat. It's cute. It's sweet. But mama has bills to pay, so it's time to put the story books away.
“You are a nihilist.”
Nothing could be further from the truth. Things have more meaning to me than is probably considered healthy. When I become passionate about something, it fucking consumes me. I have drive and goals and loves and meaning and value. I am not a nihilist, nor do I think I could ever be capable of being one.
You have to be careful when you assume something like this about someone. When you say it to me, you're insinuating that I think my love for my son cannot truly be known, communicated, and that it has no meaning. You're saying that to a devoted mother…
I'll give you a second to rethink it.
“The reason you don't believe in god is… [insert straw man here]”
There's only one reason I don't believe in god and that's because I have never found a reason to do so. A convincing reason for me, would be demonstrable, repeatable and observable by anyone. I am not angry at god. I do not “want to sin”. I simply have no reason to believe and until I do, I will live my life as though there is no god.
“You think religious people are stupid.”
No, honey. I think you are stupid. I think assuming things about strangers on the internet is a sign of stupidity. Not religious belief. I think if you were truly interested in an honest discussion, you would ask about what I think before assuming it.
“You want to deconvert people”
It's funny because I was just chatting with a friend yesterday afternoon about how I am not out to deconvert people. I just want people to admit they don't know with certainty. If they can admit that, well, then they can admit that their ideas are not any better than anyone else's, and should not be a determining factor in who gets human rights and who doesn't, or which laws get passed and which do not.
“Yes, you do want to deconvert people. Why would you post so many things against religion if you didn't?”
As I stated on my FAQ over a year and a half ago, this site and associated social spaces are geared specifically toward other atheists. These are supposed to be safe spaces for us to talk about how we view religion, without the threat of being fired, disowned by family, physically harmed, locked up or killed. If you, as a religious person, happen to stumble across these spaces, it's something that cannot be helped. I am not trying to deconvert you, as much as your persecution complex wants so badly to believe. I am just trying to talk to my heathen buddies about heathen things on my heathen spaces.
That said, the theists who do stick around and can handle it,
You truly are, because not only can we have great conversations honestly when they come up, but through your patience and thick skin, we can learn more and more about each other and nothing facilitates progress better than understanding.
“You're obsessed with god! It's all you talk about!”
Religion is indeed all I talk about as my online “Godless Mom” persona, but did you know, I have a whole other life? I do! In fact, there are huge chunks of each day that pass during which I am not being “Godless Mom” and am just being Courtney the wife, mom, daughter, sister, doggy owner and friend. Further, if you scroll through my blog, you'll see a metric ton of posts about the American Justice system, and some posts that are creative writing exercises, and you'll even notice one of my most abundant series', called “Atheist Life Hacks” which really have nothing to do with atheism at all, but are, instead, stories from my pretty eventful life. In fact, if I had to whittle it down to a percentage of my life, I'd say being Godless is maybe 1 or 2% of who I am. My interests and passions are varied and plentiful. However, on my “Godless Mom” web site and social spaces, it seems particularly fitting to be talking about my lack of religion and how I feel about the effect of religion on the world. So that's what I do here. If I were to suddenly start posting recipes and DIYs, well then I wouldn't really be running a site that should be called “Godless Mom”, now, would I?
Believe it or not, secular families face struggles that religious families do not. A blog about raising children without religion in a world that is overwhelmingly religious, is not a blog obsessed with God. It's a blog that attempts to help others sort out these struggles; to help them see that being raised without God can and was a wonderful way to grow up (via Atheist Life Hacks); and to help them cope with the onslaught of religious arguments that we find ourselves bombarded with as soon as we make our disbelief known. Hopefully, nonbelievers can find themselves having a chuckle while doing this.
For theists who come at me like Jack Torrence with a limp, smiling condescendingly and dumping assumption after assumption on me: quit it. It's not doing you any favours. You just look like a morally bankrupt loser. You make a better case for atheists to not want to be anything like you.
A better approach is to ask questions. In fact, I invite them. I'll even give you my email address to do so: mommy@godlessmom.com I look forward to having honest and open conversations with believers. All you have to do is ask before you assume.
Sequestration is not having a deterrent effect on federal conferences in Las Vegas.
This week, the Department of Education announced it would be going forward with a three-day conference at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Oklahoma Republican Sen. Tom Coburn calls the decision is inappropriate.
“At a time when the Administration is making the dubious claim that 1,172,000 students ‘will lose access to suport [sic] programs and special education,' the Department should not be diverting resources to lavish conferences,” Coburn wrote in a letter to Education Secretary Arne Duncan Wednesday.
The conference is scheduled to take place in December to train “financial aid professionals.”
“The [Federal Student Aid] Training Conference offers premiere hands-on, face-to-face training for financial aid professionals throughout the financial aid community,” the announcement reads.
“This year's conference program will focus on topics related to changes in Title IV policies and programs that affect your job and, more importantly, the students you serve,” it adds.
Coburn called on the department to cancel the conference and conduct a review on any upcoming conferences for the rest of the year. He further requested additional information on the cost of upcoming conferences and events.
The $2.5 billion budget reduction at the Department of Education under sequestration affects educational improvement, special education, technical education and some federal student aid programs.
“Effective management of sequestration is critical, and the Department should not be choosing Washington bureaucrats over funding for schools that serve low-income children,” Coburn wrote. One way to help “free up thousands in grant dollars for schools,” he said, would be to require some furlough days for 50 employees in the Office of Communications and Outreach with six-figure salaries.
“[T]hroughout the Department, there are numerous positions that are important but not as critical to the mission of the agency as serving the schoolchildren of the nation,” he wrote.
Coburn further questioned the point of a Duncan's annual bus tour. This year, he is scheduled to go through New Mexico, Texas, Arizona and California.
“It is unclear how this messaging event will directly benefit the taxpayers, states, schools, and students that the Department serves,” he wrote. “The Department should consider the cost to taxpayers when planning messaging events like the 2013 bus tour. Education dollars belong in the classroom and should not be wasted on campaign-style bus tours and junkets.”
Cameron French, a spokesman with the Department of Education, explained to TheDC in an email that the department alternates its FSA training conference for financial aid professionals each year between the Eastern region of the U.S. and the Central/Western Region and decided on Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas because it provided the best value for the conference's needs. He further noted that cost control measures in the past five years has led to a drop in the cost per attendee of 60 percent or $437 in 2007 to $175 in 2012.
In response to Coburn's letter, French wrote that the Education Department cannot move funding for its FSA conferences, back to school tours and employee salaries to other programs.
“Each accounts and the programs within the accounts had to be reduced by the same percentage. Because those big programs get so much more in appropriations than our accounts that pay for employee salaries, travel, conferences, etc., they also got cut by more,” he wrote. “We have cut back conferences already. We have also pared back hiring in all offices, including the offices Sen. Coburn singled out. We cut $85 million from our accounts covering salaries and expenses in the 2013 sequester.”
According to French the department has already eliminated, restructured and cut costs on other conferences.

Proposing the Satoshi Oath for developers
Klara Jaya Brekke Blocked Unblock Follow Sep 20, 2016
In a time that is rife with corruption scandals and disillusionment in existing financial and political institutions the blockchain has a set of properties that has made it so attractive for so many people across industries as well as across the political spectrum: decentralisation, immutability and neutrality. But in the messy real world that we inhabit, these properties are only a set of ideal values that people might strive towards or use to their advantage rather than features that are always and fully guaranteed by the architecture.
This much can be learned from the past few years of governance crises across the major blockchain projects (see for example the DAO / Ethereum hack and Bitcoin block size conflict). Somewhere along the line, someone is making decisions and writing code, somewhere there is someone with a different idea or version of decentralisation or neutrality, and not everybody has the same types of capacities to engage with and act in the system. That is not necessarily a bad thing. Disagreement and differences should not be repressed. But what this does mean is that the problem of governance, of power and authority is not simply resolved through technical architecture, it has just radically changed shape and character to include algorithmic processes and cryptographic proof.
The Satoshi Oath for developers is designed to draw out the edges and limitations of the technical architecture in guaranteeing these values and to help each person clarify what exactly they mean for each given project they might work on. It is a tool to think through how a project might relate to the people and environments that it affects and to think beyond code.
To do this, it takes each of these three central properties of the blockchain and adds two helpful concepts to start questioning how values like immutability, neutrality and decentralisation relate to the social contexts where they are being applied: Power, Change, Delegation, Disclosure, Dissensus and Exodus.
- Immutability is a central attribute of the blockchain to ensure trust in the system and integrity of the data. But not every situation can be anticipated: the world changes, systems need to adapt and data might be incorrect and even hurt someone (take the example of medical records, credit ratings or identity systems). There might be situations where the rule of immutability needs to be flexible, where the protocol or the data in fact does need to be changed. Ask yourself, who (or what) has the power to change the protocol in such a situation? What are the processes for this? What is the full range of people and environments that might be affected by this change? How will a non-technical user be made aware of changes that might affect them? In what ways can they influence this?
- Neutrality is an ideal that should be strived for but is never fully realised because all systems operate on a set of assumptions about how the world works, what people want and how they behave. A design is usually open for negotiation in the early days, before one version wins out over another and becomes normalised and possibly made into a standard. When these assumptions are encoded into a system they become automatically reinforced, invisible and harder to change. Ask yourself, what are the assumptions and behaviours that are delegated to the infrastructure to automatically reinforce? What needs to be disclosed in order for people to be able to understand, influence and possibly even change the assumptions of the system down the line? What languages (code or human-based) are needed for such explanations to make it understandable to those affected?
- Decentralisation could be said to be the most fundamental principle of blockchain technology. But in practice, one version of decentralisation might clash with another, and if it becomes compulsory to take part in a decentralised system, the system itself becomes an oppressive authority in its own right. — The only difference being that it is less obvious than centralised authorities of the past because power is executed across multiple actors in the network. Ask yourself, how does the system deal with dissensus? — Is it possible to disagree with the development of/changes to a system? How can it be expressed, by whom and with what consequences? Is exodus possible? — To leave the system entirely? And what are the different consequences for different types of users and contributors for disagreeing or leaving?
The Satoshi Oath for developers is a tool to make visible the informal social processes that are part of the infrastructure, to consider who or what benefits or who or what is left behind by different design decisions. A decentralised computer network does not guarantee decentralised power, transparency does not guarantee legibility and finally, code and cryptography does not guarantee neutrality.

Satoshi Oath for developers
Satoshi — name meaning clear thinking, quick witted, wise
When you are developing your own blockchain based application you are not just making another app or involved in another start-up, you are taking part in creating a new form of society. This oath is designed as a practical guide and a symbolic initiation into a community of developers with an expanded view of blockchain development. By taking this oath, you pledge to consider the full extent and range of the people and environments your work might affect, with special attention to the most marginalised and those not represented, and to consider each point below in the design and development of new applications.
The blockchain has its roots in Bitcoin, which was a response to corrupt centralized and opaque power structures that became explicit in the financial crisis of 2008. The core values that inspired its design are therefore decentralisation, openness and neutrality, but these values cannot be fully guaranteed by the technical architecture alone and must be considered for each project that is undertaken. A decentralized computer network does not guarantee decentralized power; code and cryptography does not guarantee neutrality; openness does not guarantee legibility.
IMMUTABILITY is essential for decentralised trust, but change is inevitable and necessary: not every contingency can be anticipated, data might be incorrect or hurt someone, contexts change and protocols need to adapt over time.
CHANGE — I pledge to consider who or what has the power to determine change (in the protocol or data), and how to make this power visible and accountable.
POWER — I pledge to think of the full range of people and environments that might be affected by changes, and to consider how their voices might be represented.
NEUTRALITY is an ideal that should be strived for but is never fully realized because all systems operate on a set of assumptions about how the world works, what people want and how they behave. When these assumptions are encoded into a system they become automatically reinforced, invisible and harder to change.
DELEGATION — I pledge to consider the assumptions and biases of the app/platform I am developing and how these are delegated to and enforced by the code.
DISCLOSURE — I pledge to make these assumptions and biases visible in all the languages (code and human) necessary to make these understandable to all those who might be affected.
DECENTRALISATION is the most central attribute of the blockchain, but in practice, one version of decentralisation might clash with another. If it becomes compulsory to take part in a decentralized system, the system itself becomes an oppressive authority in its own right.
DISSENSUS — I pledge to consider the possibility of and consequences for disagreeing with decisions and developments of the system for all types of people.
EXODUS — I pledge to consider the possibility and consequences of leaving the system/platform/app for all types of people.
And beyond — I pledge to consider my limitations and seek advice from colleagues in other fields relevant to my work when needed.

The New York Knicks are pursuing Toronto point guard Kyle Lowry with a package of Raymond Felton, Metta World Peace and a 2018 first-round draft pick, league sources told Yahoo Sports.
The Knicks refused a Raptors proposal that would've included Iman Shumpert and Felton, sources told Yahoo Sports. WIthout a first-round pick or Shumpert, there is no traction for a deal. The Knicks have no appetite for including Shumpert or rookie Tim Hardaway Jr. in a package.
Scroll to continue with content Ad
Knicks owner Jim Dolan is sensitive to the public perception that Toronto general manger Masai Ujiri bamboozled New York in the Carmelo Anthony trade, and the chance of getting panned for giving up too much in a deal for Lowry has become a hurdle in these talks, league sources told Yahoo Sports.
Ujiri was the GM of the Denver Nuggets when he negotiated a deal that included Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler, Felton, Timofey Mozgov and a first-round pick for a package that included Anthony and Chauncey Billups.
Toronto is discussing deals for Lowry with an ever-growing list of teams, league sources said.
Several teams are pursuing Lowry, but the Knicks' most direct competition for him could come from the Brooklyn Nets, who are also exploring the possibility of a deal, league sources said. Brooklyn has resisted the inclusion of its 2020 first-round pick in a package, nor one of its top young players, including rookie Mason Plumlee, sources said.
Within the Knicks, there's hesitance on including the draft pick, but there's no chance a deal for Lowry could get done without it, sources said. Nevertheless, there's still doubt on how long New York will keep a pick on the table, sources said.
Story continues
Toronto officials have been scouting and calling European contacts on Bojan Bogdanovic, a 24-year-old shooting guard with whom the Nets own the rights, league sources told Yahoo Sports.
The Knicks have lost Felton for two to three weeks with a hamstring injury. He has been largely ineffective for most of the season.
Lowry has wanted a trade for most of the season and the Raptors became more motivated to move him after acquiring point guard Greiveis Vasquez in a deal with the Sacramento Kings.
World Peace, who signed as free agent this summer, can't be traded until Sunday, per league rules. Freshly signed free agents aren't eligible to be included in trades until Dec. 15.

Editor's note: This story originally ran in July 2014. SportsDay is bringing it back after Lawrence's dominant performance vs. Arizona won him NFC Defensive Player of the Week honors. IRVING -- DeMarcus Lawrence isn't simply tough. "He's really tough," Cowboys defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli cooed almost lovingly, upping the ante when asked to describe the finest qualities of the second-round draft choice the team desperately needs to be its dominant pass rusher this season. But aren't all football players by definition "tough"? Yes, Marinelli, the ex-Marine whose résumé includes Vietnam combat service, conceded on the final day of last month's minicamp. But there are degrees. According to his calculus, "really tough" is the ultimate while "finesse" can almost sound like a dirty word. Across the Cowboys' Valley Ranch locker room, Lawrence, the 6-3, 250-pound rookie penciled in to immediately play right defensive end and, it's hoped, wreak havoc on opposing quarterbacks, sat up taller, puffed his chest wider and smiled broader when apprised of Marinelli's assessment. To be sure, when training camp opens this week in Oxnard, Calif., Lawrence's toughness and pass-rushing ability will be under a microscope, particularly in trench battles with Tyron Smith, who may be the NFL's gold standard at offensive left tackle. "Tough is the only way to grow up where I come from," said Lawrence, who turned 22 in April, a month before the NFL draft. "I had to fight for everything from the time I was born."
DeMarcus Lawrence wins NFC Defensive Player of the Week, still says he was 'not good enough'
Where Lawrence comes from is rural South Carolina. The official biographies say he's from Aiken, population 30,000, about 20 miles east of Augusta, Ga. Truth be told, he's not from such a metropolis. Lawrence is from New Ellenton, S.C., about 10 miles south of Aiken. It's a town of almost 2,000 and, if you believe Lawrence as a tour guide, it should not be mistaken for idyllic, mythical Mayberry, up over the North Carolina border. New Ellenton was born in the 1950s, a Cold War invention of President Harry Truman, in the process of adding to the United States' nuclear arsenal. Ellenton, the town's predecessor, was deemed a perfect place to produce plutonium and tritium for hydrogen bombs. To that end, the government displaced the population 14 miles to the north to New Ellenton and in Ellenton's place established what is still called the relatively benign-sounding Savannah River Plant. Mayor Vernon Dunbar is proud of his New Ellenton but concedes it "has some bad things kids can get into in a place where there are not a lot of outlets for them." "Kids really had to be tough," said Dunbar, who works at the nuclear plant and was a high school classmate of DeMarcus Lawrence's father, Tyrone, as well as future iconic NFL defensive lineman William "The Refrigerator" Perry. That's "tough," like when DeMarcus was 7 and a teenage boy, a friend of his older brother, began "roughing me up on a basketball court." DeMarcus said he fought back because he had no choice. His world was watching for any sign of weakness. The older boy clamped DeMarcus in a front headlock and repeatedly pounded his head. But he wouldn't concede. "He tanked me," is Lawrence's simple explanation. "But I didn't go down." And so for his fighting for his manhood, Lawrence was dubbed "Tank," a nickname he proudly carries to his day. "What I remember most about DeMarcus is that if you didn't bother him, he didn't bother you," said Dunbar, serving his third term as mayor. "But if you did mess with him, he could hold his own." Running start

Tyrone Lawrence was determined that his youngest son, DeMarcus, would grow up capable of holding his own, tough and independent. So father, who has sweated for 34 years making his living in front of a 2,300-degree furnace at a giant fiberglass plant, insisted son get to and from high school football practice on foot. Running the several miles each way was preferable, father said in a telephone conversation last month. DeMarcus made his pilgrimages in heat and cold, in rain and wind. Lightning was the boy's only passport to the luxury of a ride, father said. But not in his own car. DeMarcus didn't have one. Even so, father made sure son learned how to change tires, transmissions and engines. Father had a power lawn mower. Son pushed his own. Father had a blower for leaves. Son had a rake. Meanwhile DeMarcus' mother, Yvonne, taught him how to cook dinner for the family by the time he was 12. When older sister LaShondra's husband died and she moved back home but still worked, DeMarcus cooked for her, her three children, his parents and a grandmother. Among his specialties, DeMarcus said, were chicken Alfredo, macaroni and cheese, and just about any kind of pasta dish. "I can cook," he said definitively, sensing skepticism in the air. End of discussion.
Cowboys' win showed DeMarcus Lawrence needs a big fat extension, concerns about Zeke
"A boy must learn to be a man who stands on his feet, to provide for his family," said Tyrone Lawrence, explaining the parenting philosophy he has shared with Yvonne, who still works as a cook near the Savannah River Plant. "I trained him that no one gives you anything. You have to go out and earn everything. It was tough love, but effective." But Tyrone and Yvonne believed they had a far more pressing responsibility: keeping their family safe. When a police chase led to the arrest of a drug dealer in the backyard of the Lawrence family home in the gritty New Ellenton neighborhood known as Dodge City, Yvonne insisted it was time to move to a more peaceful setting. "We didn't have a lot of material things to give him," Tyrone said. "But we wanted to make sure he had a decent life opportunity." And so the family moved to Windsor, population 121. "DeMarcus walked everywhere from there," his father said. "But he never hung out at clubs or the mall. There were no clubs, and the closest mall is 30 miles away." Football 'passion'

At Silver Bluff High School, a perennial small-school power in South Carolina, coach Al Lown played the relatively small DeMarcus at tight end on offense as well as defensive end. "Football became my passion," DeMarcus said. "It was a place where I could release all my angry energy instead of doing bad things on the street." DeMarcus may not appreciate it, but Lown, whose teams have won 200 games and five state titles in his tenure as the Bulldogs' coach, chuckled when the conversation turned to Lawrence's toughness. "I understand he wants to portray he's kind of bad," Lown said "But he can be a softy." DeMarcus enjoyed a growth spurt in the 10th grade, but still major colleges didn't have much interest in a 6-2, 210-pound defensive end who was struggling in the classroom. Lown said South Carolina State, a Football Championship Subdivision school, was interested in Lawrence, but that was about it for four-year schools. "I didn't care much about school back then," DeMarcus said. "I had a hard time understanding why I needed school. It seemed like everybody was telling me, 'You can't make it.' Nobody but my family believed in me. For a long time, I believed the negative voices."
But he did have the opportunity to attend Kansas' Butler Community College, where he rehabilitated his grades while gaining strength and weight and honing his toughness. In his second year at the school, he was named a national junior college second-team All-American.
DeMarcus said he heard from schools such as Tennessee, Ole Miss, Kansas State and Oklahoma but settled on the one farthest from home, Boise State, 2,300 miles from Windsor because "that's where I fit in best."
The distance didn't scare him.
"I was prepared for the journey," DeMarcus said. "You know, my parents taught me how to survive."

Lessons learned and play on the field at Boise State catapulted Lawrence to the 34th pick early in the second round of the NFL draft. So desperate were the Cowboys for his services as a replacement for the departed DeMarcus Ware that they traded two picks -- No. 47 and No. 78 -- to move up 13 spots.
At Boise, DeMarcus had 20½ tackles for loss and 10½ sacks last season. The scouts were impressed with his speed and his oversized "violent" hands that he used to ward off blockers.
"DeMarcus was not the biggest, but he was the toughest," said Andy Avalos, who coached the defensive line in Lawrence's two seasons in Boise. "On game day, when you go into an alley, you want him in your corner. He can be a big Teddy Bear, but when it's time to roll, he'll roll over you."
On the flip side, Lawrence served three one-game suspensions in two seasons for what remain unspecified violations of team rules.
Lawrence blamed "childish behavior" for the suspensions.
Avalos said he would tell anyone interested in listening that Lawrence has "matured" and "grown" in his time in Boise.
The Cowboys are satisfied that his maturation now matches his toughness and his determination to succeed.
"We felt like those are issues that are in his past," head coach Jason Garrett said after the draft. "He is the kind of guy we want to bring to this football team."
Marinelli, the defensive coordinator, has been effusive about Lawrence's potential to replace Ware, who has taken his pass rush to the Denver Broncos.
"I think we got the right one," Marinelli said, noting Lawrence's tenacity. "If he gets beat, he just comes back harder the next time."
Back in South Carolina, a labor dispute at the fiberglass plant is keeping Tyrone, DeMarcus' father, away from work. On the day his son signed a four-year contract that will pay in the neighborhood of $5.5 million, Tyrone, who is 55 and grew up rooting for the Cowboys' "Doomsday" defense that featured sack king Harvey Martin, lamented his idleness.
"At least DeMarcus is working," the father said. "That's what he has prepared for his whole life." Twitter: @bhorn55
This Topic is Missing Your Voice.
As the 2015 Legislature commenced, Capitol speculators wondered whether rookie House Speaker Kurt Daudt could keep a fracture-prone new Republican majority together. He's got a scary rift to bridge between exurban Tea Partiers and conventional Greater Minnesota Republicans, the chatterers said. It's gonna be tough for the three-termer from Crown.
As the 2015 session lurched last week to a special-session finish, such talk had almost completely flipped to its partisan inverse: How will Senate DFL Majority Leader Tom Bakk cope with a gaping division between metro and rural/Iron Range members of his caucus? Can the eight-termer from Cook quiet the discontent that has been rumbling since the regular session ended?
Rural/urban tension is nothing new in Minnesota politics, as the very name of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party implies. Through the years, that party's most memorable internal battles — abortion, guns, motorboats in the BWCA — were fought along an outstate/metro fault line.
The spat over this year's omnibus agriculture/environment/natural resources bill hasn't risen to the internecine intensity of those historic brawls. But on May 18, when the 39 Senate DFLers split 10 in favor and 29 against a bill DFL Gov. Mark Dayton later vetoed, they put a family quarrel over environmental protection on vivid display.
Those who voted yes sided with all but one of the Senate Republicans voting that day. Those who voted no were bucking Bakk, who had done much of the assembly of the bill during closed-door negotiations with Daudt. The bill's critics objected to a long list of regulation-weakening measures evidently acceptable to Bakk and his nine allied DFLers, all but one of whom represent nonmetro districts.
A particular sore point was hard-to-spot language exempting nonferrous mining from solid waste rules. It was a provision that had never been introduced as a bill or heard in any legislative committee before its appearance on May 18.
John Marty
Another rub: elimination of the 48-year-old Citizens' Board of the Pollution Control Agency, which employed language that had not been passed by either legislative chamber. The board is under fire for seeking an environmental-impact statement from a proposed dairy megafarm last year.
The Senate DFLers who voted no that day would have been unhappy had a Republican majority or Republican governor forced such measures into an omnibus bill. The fact that their own caucus leader and his adjacent-district ally, conference committee co-chair David Tomassoni, DFL-Chisholm, had fingerprints on them made “unhappy” an understatement.
The DFLer who led the May 18 floor attack on the bill is known to Minnesotans of long political memory — state Sen. John Marty, DFL-Roseville. Though he chairs the Senate's environment and energy policy panel, he was largely frozen out of the dealmaking that crafted the omnibus ag/enviro bill.
Twenty-one years ago, Marty was his party's up-and-coming candidate for governor. It was his misfortune to run against incumbent Republican Gov. Arne Carlson, whose popularity swelled in 1994 as he fended off a primary challenge from the GOP hard right.
“I got clobbered,” Marty said last week. For a long time thereafter, “I was punished for that. In politics, you are worthless if you don't win an election.”
Today at age 58 and serving his ninth term, Marty is far from worthless. He has become the Senate's voice of conscience, known for sounding off when special interests aren't in sync with the public interest. One might conclude that spending time in political purgatory early in his career built his courage.
It would be a stretch to cast Marty as Bakk's rival for caucus leadership. Others may make that fight. But Marty has emerged in recent weeks as a potent critic of the environmental policies Bakk accepted and the dealmaking process that produced the year's final bills.
Too often, Marty says, Senate negotiators agreed to GOP-backed policy in exchange for more spending than House Republicans initially sought. Those policy measures went into must-pass budget bills, ones that have to be set in law by July 1 to avert a government shutdown. The budget thus functioned as a hostage, used to compel votes for policies that, in isolation, would not have passed muster in the Senate, Marty believes, despite its metro/outstate divide.
“We can deal with the differences between the metro and the rural areas of the state,” he said. “We always have. Concern for this state's natural resources polls well in every part of the state. You can have honest disagreements about particular policies and still find a way forward. But when people are playing games with the process, that's what tears apart a caucus and a party.”
Marty favors a change in legislative rules to segregate policymaking from budget-setting. Policy matters should be addressed in separate bills, he argues.
The idea isn't original with him. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, seven states go so far as to require their legislatures to work exclusively on budgetary matters in one session and reserve policy bills for a subsequent one. Those restrictions typically aren't absolute; most allow exceptions with a supermajority vote.
Ironically, the other DFL senator who has voiced interest in separating policy and budgeting bills is Tom Bakk. Weeks before the session ended, he sent Senate committee chairs a memo urging them to keep policy matters out of budget bills. Policy differences between the House and Senate only serve to complicate budget negotiations, he advised.
One sign of the tension that has built within the Senate majority caucus is that the sincerity of that memo is now in question.
Those hard feelings made a Bakk-Marty alliance on procedural reform or much of anything else seem far-fetched last week. Then again, Bakk is the son of a Lutheran camp director, and Marty is the son of a leading Lutheran theologian. They likely share a few notions about repentance, forgiveness and redemption, and those concepts can produce surprising fruit.

Eric Trump.
Donald Trump did his own post-debate spin last week, but for the vice-presidential debate he delegated the task to his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, and his son, Eric Trump. They both denied accusations that Trump doesn't pay federal income taxes, apparently unaware that the correct response to such questions is a terse “that makes him smart.”
After the New York Times published pages from Trump's 1995 tax return, revealing that he suffered a loss so huge it could have wiped out his federal income taxes for 18 years, the Trump campaign offered this response: “Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, employee taxes, and federal taxes, along with very substantial charitable contributions.”
The statement does not explicitly say that Trump paid federal income taxes, nor does it specify how much of those “hundreds of millions of dollars” went to the federal government. But on Tuesday Conway clarified to NBC News that Trump has “of course” paid federal income taxes “in the years that he had a profit.”
JUST IN: Campaign manager: Accountants, lawyers say Trump has paid 100s of millions in taxes, incl. federal income. https://t.co/ieO9X6XrkU — NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) October 5, 2016
How much, exactly? We still have no idea because, as NBC News sassily notes, Trump still won't release his tax returns.
Campaign manager's assertion is unverifiable, as Trump refuses to release his taxes, citing audit -- though audit doesn't prevent release. — NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) October 5, 2016
In a tense interview with CNN, Eric Trump backed up the claim that his father has paid federal income taxes in the past 18 years. “Of course, yes, absolutely,” he said.
“Why not release the income tax returns that are no longer under audit?” Wolf Blitzer asked.
“My father said, when the audits are over he will release the taxes,” Eric said, suggesting in the same breath that Trump would produce the tax returns if Clinton released her deleted emails and transcripts of her speeches to Wall Street.
Blitzer pressed him to answer the question, noting that Trump's taxes from 2002 to 2008 are no longer under audit. “I don't know if that's true,” Eric replied. It is, according to a letter released by Trump's tax attorneys in March.
Eric spun out after that, demanding that the three CNN anchors tell him how Hillary Clinton earned a quarter of a billion dollars after leaving the White House. John King reminded him that (despite his father's accusations) they don't work for the Clinton campaign, and asked him to respond to Tim Kaine's accusation during the debate that Trump owes money to people in Russia.
“We have no assets in Russia. We have no debt in Russia. I haven't been to Russia in like six, seven years, off the top of my head, five years, six years, seven years? I mean it's nonsense,” Eric said.
Eric claimed that's a lie concocted by the Clinton campaign, but in a 2008 speech, Eric's brother, Donald Trump Jr., said the company wanted to do business in Russia, and he'd been traveling there frequently. “Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,” Donald Jr. said. “We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.” As the Washington Post notes, “It may be possible that [Trump] has no current investments in Russia, but not for lack of trying.”
A tax return would show whether Trump has any Russian assets, though Eric says there's a better method. “If you want to know if we have assets in Russia, go look to see if our name is on a building, go look to see if we own any property there. We're a real-estate company. We're a bricks and mortar company. The reality is we don't. We just don't.”
When it comes to debate spin, never send a boy to do a (con) man's job.
Lawyers for a terrorism suspect once held at Guantánamo Bay who is now facing prosecution in Manhattan asked a judge on Tuesday to dismiss his case on the ground that his nearly five years in detention denied him his constitutional right to a speedy trial.
The terrorism suspect, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, was captured in Pakistan in 2004, held for two years in secret prisons run by the C.I.A., and then moved in 2006 to the naval base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. During his detention, he says, he was subjected to cruel interrogation techniques and denied a lawyer.
Although Mr. Ghailani faces charges stemming from a terrorist act that predated the Sept. 11 attacks, his speedy trial motion could foreshadow issues that could arise in the prosecution of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the professed organizer of the 9/11 plot, and four other Guantánamo detainees who were recently ordered sent to New York for trial.
“We respectfully submit that this case presents possibly the most unique and egregious example of a speedy trial violation in American jurisprudence to date,” Mr. Ghailani's lawyers said in a motion that was heavily censored because of its reliance on classified information.
The motion was originally filed several weeks ago with Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, but it was kept almost entirely under seal pending a review by the government. The new version, with many pages blacked out, was made public on Tuesday.
“This motion asks one primary question,” the lawyers, Peter E. Quijano, Michael K. Bachrach and Gregory Cooper, wrote. “Can national security trump an indicted defendant's constitutional Right to a Speedy Trial? We respectfully submit that the answer is emphatically and without qualification, ‘No.' ”
Mr. Ghailani, a Tanzanian who is believed to be in his mid-30s, has pleaded not guilty. He has been charged with conspiring to help carry out Al Qaeda's 1998 bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, attacks that killed 224 people. The military has also said that he later served as a cook and a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden.
A spokeswoman for the United States attorney's office in Manhattan had no comment on the filing.
Housing and homelessness bodies who have had their funding cut by the Abbott government say they do not know how they will continue to do their work beyond June.
Homelessness Australia, National Shelter and the Community Housing Federation of Australia found out just before Christmas that they would not have their federal funding renewed - even though the Department of Social Services has confirmed it finds their advice valuable.
Peak housing and homelessness bodies have had their funding cut.
Together, they have received about $825,000 a year from the Commonwealth, which made up about 90 per cent of their overall funding.
The groups say that if the government was serious about being more consultative, it should restore the funding because they provide evidence-based police advice on low-income and vulnerable people.
This Post Shows How a Community of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Writers Was Born On Steemit
The steemSTEM Team: @justtryme90 (a biochemist), @lemouth (a theoretical particle physicist), @coinbitgold (a science and technology writer), @cristi (an independent researcher and writer) and @herpetologyguy (an ecologist) plus contributions from @donkeypong, @wingz, @gavvet and others. Several team members volunteer and dedicate both their time and knowledge to this project for free.
The Steemit Chat Channel: #steemSTEM
Announcing steemSTEM, a Science - Technology - Engineering - Mathematics Project on Steemit
The Origins
Everything began some time ago when @coinbitgold initiated the academiaspotlight series to promote the work of new Steemians who are engineers and/or scientists in their day jobs. She quickly realized that she was only able to help one person at a time with each review post, and that many other good science posts still went unnoticed and silenced. Moreover, she became frustrated seeing some outright-plagiarized science content rewarded more than the good content! At this point she considered leaving Steemit for good.
Yet just as things were looking their worst she met @wingz who suggested starting a science community on Steemit! At the same time, she met real-life scientists and active contributors like @justtryme90 and @lemouth who were also working to grow the Steemit science community day by day.
Together, a community of science writers on Steemit was born.
A New Hope
And do you think they lived happily ever after? Of course not. The group still watched as some partially or totally inaccurate science content got trendy and upvoted a lot! Still they did not give up, they pushed forward and kept supporting each other.
Soon, an Initiative Started...
This group now consisting of scientists, engineers, mathematicians, science and technology writers, @justtryme90 @lemouth @coinbitgold @herpetologyguy @pjheinz @team.leibniz @cristi @valenttina @krishtopa @deviedev @daut44 @logic and others. Everyone shared their views on the future of science on Steemit.
The Initiatives
And we are here today to announce the steemSTEM initiative!

A federal appeals court has upheld key parts of Texas's strict anti-abortion law, far-reaching restrictions that have already closed more than two dozen clinics across the state and now seem destined for the U.S. Supreme Court.
The decision Tuesday by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans affirms Texas officials' enforcement of most of House Bill 2, legislation passed in 2013 that requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and for clinics to meet strict specifications of ambulatory surgical centers.
Abortion rights advocates argued those restrictions were "onerous" and placed an undue burden on women seeking abortions, particularly women who live in poor and rural Texas counties who must travel long distances for the procedure.
The state's Republican leaders, and especially Gov. Greg Abbott, championed the law and say it provides better safety standards to protect women.
Abortion providers will now turn to the U.S. Supreme Court, which temporarily sidelined the Texas law last year.
Tuesday's ruling is the latest win for state leaders in a protracted legal fight, with lower courts siding with abortion rights groups who sued the state, and the higher court sympathizing with Abbott, who as attorney general fought against legal challenges.
"This unanimous decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the Texas Legislature to craft a law to protect the health and safety of Texas women," Abbott said in a statement.
"The State of Texas will continue to fight for higher-quality health care standards for women while protecting our most vulnerable - the unborn."
However, the three-judge panel upheld some of the lower court's ruling in providing special rules for an abortion facility in McAllen, which can continue operating without upgrading to the hospital-like standards required of other facilities.
If that facility closed, women in the Rio Grande Valley seeking abortions would have gone to the nearest clinic in San Antonio, hours away by car or bus. That distance represented an undue burden, the panel ruled, on women's access to abortion as protected by the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade.
The physician at the McAllen facility is not required to have admitting privileges a nearby hospital, the panel ruled.
Heather Busby, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, said that narrow victory is little consolation amid the statewide clamp down on clinics.
"I think this is a travesty," she said. "We're only going to have eight safe, legal clinics."
Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, an advocacy group based in New York, said the ruling has "the potential to devastate access to reproductive health care on such a sweeping scale."
"Once again, women across the state of Texas face the near total elimination of safe and legal options for ending a pregnancy, and the denial of their constitutional rights," she said in a statement.
But Joe Pojman, executive director of Texas Alliance for Life, a group which helped draft the restrictions, said the point of the bill isn't to restrict abortions and that it is "do-able" for facilities that don't meet the new standards to upgrade.
"The purpose of House Bill 2 was to ensure that abortions are not done in an manner that puts the health and safety of women at risk," Pojman said.
"They carved out an exception for one facility and physician in McAllen," he added, "But we find it very encouraging that the law can be applied to the rest of the state of Texas."
15 1 2 ) levels [ 1 18 Shape of oxygen dissociation curve Dyshemoglobins - Carboxyhemoglobin - Methemoglobin Dyes Low perfusion state Skin pigmentation Anemia Nail polish Motion artifact Limited knowledge of the technique Oximeters have limitations which may result in erroneous readings [] (Table). Because of the sigmoid shape of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, oximetry may not detect hypoxemia in patients with high arterial oxygen tension (PaO) levels [].
Conventional pulse oximeters can distinguish only two substances: reduced hemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin; it assumes that dyshemoglobins—such as carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) and methemoglobin (MetHb)—are absent (Fig. 1). Studies showed that the presence of elevated levels of COHb and MetHb could affect the accuracy of SpO 2 readings [1,19]. Accordingly, multiwavelength oximeters that are capable of estimating blood levels of COHb and MetHb have recently been designed [20]. In healthy volunteers, the accuracy of a multiwavelength oximeter (Masimo Rainbow-SET Rad-57 Pulse CO-oximeter; Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) in measuring dyshemoglobins was evaluated by inducing carboxyhemoglobinemia (levels range from 0 % to 15 %) and methemoglobinemia (levels range from 0 % to 12 %) [20]. Bias between COHb levels measured with the pulse CO-oximeter and COHb levels measured with the laboratory CO-oximeter (standard method) was −1.22 %; the corresponding precision was 2.19 %. Bias ± precision of MetHB measured with the pulse CO-oximeter and MetHb measured with the laboratory CO-oximeter was 0.0 % ± 0.45 %. The accuracy of pulse CO-oximeters in measuring COHb levels was also assessed during hypoxia [21]. In 12 healthy volunteers, the pulse CO-oximeter was accurate in measuring COHb at an SaO 2 of less than 95 % (bias of −0.7 % and precision of 4.0 %); however, when the SaO 2 dropped below 85%, the pulse CO-oximeter was unable to measure COHb levels. In patients evaluated in the emergency department with suspected carbon monoxide poisoning, the bias between pulse CO-oximetric measurement of COHb and laboratory CO-oximetric measurement of COHb was less than 3 % [22,23]. The limits of agreement between the measurements, however, were large (−11.6 % to 14.14 %) [23], leading some authors to conclude that these new pulse CO-oximeters may not be used interchangeably with standard laboratory measurements of COHb [22–24].
1 6 25 26 2 can be produced by various ambient light sources, the presence of such sources could produce false SpO 2 readings. To test the accuracy of pulse oximetry in the presence of ambient light, Fluck and colleagues [ 27 2 measurements were obtained in a photographic darkroom under five separate light sources: quartz-halogen, infrared, incandescent, fluorescent, and bilirubin light [ 27 2 between the control condition (that is, complete darkness) and any of the five light sources was less than 5%. Nail polish can interfere with pulse oximetry readings [ 28 29 2 and SaO 2 was greatest for black (+1.6 % ± 3.0 %), purple (+1.2 % ± 2.6 %), and dark blue (+1.1 % ± 3.5 %) nail polish; limits of agreement ranged from 6 % (unpainted fingernail) to 14.4 % (dark blue) (Fig. 5 Inaccurate readings with pulse oximetry have been reported with intravenous dyes used for diagnostic purposes, low perfusion states (that is, low cardiac output, vasoconstriction, and hypothermia), pigmented subjects and in patients with sickle cell anemia []. Because the two wavelengths (660 and 940 nm) that pulse oximeters use to measure SpOcan be produced by various ambient light sources, the presence of such sources could produce false SpOreadings. To test the accuracy of pulse oximetry in the presence of ambient light, Fluck and colleagues [] performed a randomized controlled trial in healthy subjects in which SpOmeasurements were obtained in a photographic darkroom under five separate light sources: quartz-halogen, infrared, incandescent, fluorescent, and bilirubin light []. The largest difference in SpObetween the control condition (that is, complete darkness) and any of the five light sources was less than 5%. Nail polish can interfere with pulse oximetry readings []. In 50 critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation, Hinkelbein and colleagues [] found that the mean difference between SpOand SaOwas greatest for black (+1.6 % ± 3.0 %), purple (+1.2 % ± 2.6 %), and dark blue (+1.1 % ± 3.5 %) nail polish; limits of agreement ranged from 6 % (unpainted fingernail) to 14.4 % (dark blue) (Fig.). Rotating the oximeter finger probe by 90 ° did not eliminate the error induced with nail polish.
Motion artifact is considered an important cause of error and false alarms [30–33]. In the 1990s, several signal processing techniques were incorporated in pulse oximeters in an attempt to reduce motion artifact [34–38]. One such technique is Masimo signal extraction technology (SET™) [39]. During motion and hypoxia, the Masimo SET oximeter performed better than the Agilent Viridia 24C (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), the Datex-Ohmeda 3740 (Datex-Ohmeda, Madison, WI, USA), and the Nellcor N-395 (Covidien Corporation, Dublin, Ireland) oximeters [34].
For eight years, Ben S. Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, was steward of the world's largest economy. Now he has signed on to advise one of Wall Street's biggest hedge funds.
Mr. Bernanke will become a senior adviser to Citadel, the $25 billion hedge fund founded by the billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin. He will offer his analysis of global economic and financial issues to Citadel's investment committees. He will also meet with Citadel's investors around the globe.
It is the latest and most prominent move by a Washington insider through the revolving door into the financial industry. Investors are increasingly looking for guidance on how to navigate an uncertain economic environment in the aftermath of the financial crisis and are willing to pay top dollar to former officials like Mr. Bernanke.
Mr. Bernanke joins a long parade of colleagues and peers to Wall Street and investment firms. After stepping down, Mr. Bernanke's predecessor, Alan Greenspan, was recruited as a consultant for Deutsche Bank, the bond investment firm Pacific Investment Management Company and the hedge fund Paulson & Company.
A payment processing company that handles a significant number of transactions for the two dominant daily fantasy sports companies notified the operators this week that it would no longer handle their payments and in fact was leaving the industry altogether. It is perhaps the biggest blow yet to an industry that has been pummeled by legal challenges in recent months.
Vantiv Entertainment Solutions, the processing company, told its daily fantasy clients, which include FanDuel and DraftKings, that it would “suspend all processing for payment transactions” related to daily fantasy sports in the United States and its territories on Feb. 29.
The company cited the unfavorable opinions that have been issued by state attorneys general in recent months. Seven states, including Mississippi on Friday, have concluded that daily fantasy games were a form of gambling or were illegal under their current laws.
“As you are aware, an increasing number of state attorneys general have determined that daily fantasy sports (‘D.F.S.') constitute illegal gambling,” Jonathan Ellman, chief transaction and marketing counsel at Vantiv, wrote in a letter obtained by The New York Times. “Although in recent weeks D.F.S. operators have raised numerous arguments to the contrary, to date those arguments have been unsuccessful and/or rejected.”
BRUSSELS, Belgium, April 3, 2014 (ENS) – Vehicle noise limits will be tightened across the European Union to protect public health, under a new law informally agreed with EU ministers and endorsed by Parliament on Wednesday. The new law will apply to passenger cars, vans, buses, light trucks and heavy trucks.
Despite increasing traffic across the European Union, noise emissions limits for vehicles have not changed since 1996.
The new law requires the introduction of labels to inform buyers of the noise levels of new cars, as well as the addition of sound to hybrid and electric vehicles to alert pedestrians.
Persistent exposure to high levels of traffic noise can be physically draining, disrupt organ functions and contribute to cardiovascular and other diseases, according to research by the European Environment Agency. Traffic exposes half the urban population in the European Union to noise levels above 55 decibels.
“I consider the final text adopted under the trialogue negotiations as an optimal compromise that will contribute to the protection of health of our European citizens. On the other hand, it should not cause any loss of competitiveness for the European automotive industry,” said the rapporteur, Miroslav Ouzký of the Czech Republic, a member of the European Conservatives and Reformists, a conservative, anti-federalist and Eurosceptic political group in Parliament.
“I am happy that the proposal found broad support across the political groups in the European Parliament,” said Ouzký after Parliament endorsed the agreement he negotiated with EU ministers without a vote.
Once in force, the new rules will phase in new limits in three steps – by July 1, 2016, and by the same date in 2020 and in 2024.
The first phase will apply only to new engine noise limits in new vehicle types.
The second and the third phases will bring in lower decibel values and also include all new vehicles produced, two years after they start – in 2022 and in 2026.
The limit for standard cars will be reduced to 68 dbs in 12 years, from the current level of 74 dbs. More powerful vehicles will be allowed a margin of one to nine extra decibels.
The rules bring down the limit for the most powerful heavy lorries, those over 12 tonnes, to 79 dbs from 81 dbs.
MEPs point out that vehicle noise is also affected by the road surface and tire noise.
Following pressure from MEPs, the legislation also recommends that new cars be labeled to provide consumers with information on their noise levels. Similar labeling systems already exist for fuel efficiency, tire noise and CO2 emissions.
MEPs are concerned about quiet electric and hybrid cars becoming a threat to pedestrians and cyclists, and say that manufacturers must install the Acoustic Vehicle Alerting System in new types of hybrid electric vehicles by July 1, 2019.
Noise limit values will ultimately be decreased by four decibels for passenger cars, vans, buses and coaches and for trucks by three decibels.
Altogether, these measures are expected to reduce the vehicle noise nuisance by roughly 25 percent.
In addition, a new and more representative test method to measure sound emissions will ensure that the sound level of vehicles under street driving conditions does not differ from the type-approval test results. This test method is recognized internationally, making it easier for vehicle manufacturers to export outside the EU.
The World Health Organization concluded that traffic related noise may account for one million healthy years of life lost per year in Western Europe. Hence, reduction of traffic noise is essential to improve the health and quality of life of Europe's citizens.
Today's deal follows the proposal made by the European Commission on December 9, 2011.
Vice-President Antonio Tajani, the commissioner responsible for industry and entrepreneurship said today, “Noise emissions due to road traffic, from which our citizens are suffering, will be significantly reduced. I am happy that the deal reached by the Parliament and the Council keeps the overall level of ambition proposed by the Commission while making it easier for European manufacturers to sell cars outside the EU.”

Game PreviewMay 11, 2016 at 9:15a PSTby DM Sid Meiers Civilization VI announced  first look at the emperor of strategy games The long-awaited new Civilization, the sixth installment in the series, will be released this fall. In order to learn more about the most important innovations in the gameplay, weve interviewed the developers from Firaxis.
SID MEIERS CIVILIZATION VI IN A NUTSHELL: Brand new game code;
Specialized cities;
Players taking an active part in development and research;
Dynamic diplomacy;
Combining military units into superior formations;
More possibilities in the multiplayer;
Modding support.
They say the world was made in six days  the seventh was for rest. In a video game we can actually do a lot better  say, a continent in six minutes? Maybe even six clicks of a mouse? Lets take the sixth installment in the popular franchise, and we may produce a perfect world  rich with culture, maintaining a balanced diplomacy and run by remarkable inventions. Or maybe quite the contrary  total hell on Earth, ravaged by war for centuries. One thing is certain: there wont be any time to rest! We will watch over, manage, make decisions and wait. Then wait some more. One more turn... just one more... thats really the last one... just a minute, let me take that settler there, and Im done for today... oh, is at 5 a.m. already?
Thats right  weve got time for healthy and regular sleep until October 21, and then we have to brace ourselves for many a sleepless night. The sixth part in the 25-year-old series is coming! Sid Meiers Civilization VI has been in development for a long time, but only after wrapping up the release of the spin-off Beyond Earth and the recent XCOM 2 were Firaxis able to put their minds to the production of their flagship game. Weve had the utmost pleasure of talking to the studios members  lead designer Ed Beach and Senior AI Engineer Andrew Garrett - and learning some important details first-hand! The newest installment is being developed by the same team that brought the extensions Gods & Kings and Brave New World. The latter is where Civilization VI took its spirit from, but obviously theres more to the newest part than a couple of tweaks and new additions to an old game.
Virtually the entire code has been rewritten, with particular emphasis on the novelties in the mechanics, yet this time around without the simplifications we saw in Civilization V. We can assure the veterans of the series that the solutions introduced in those two expansions  such as religion, archeology, trade routes, and cultural tourism  will also make their way into the newest part. We loved a lot of those systems that were put into these expansions (...) things like that have been brought forward, because we didnt want a game that was simplified and devoid of that deep richness, says Ed Beach, the games lead designer. The whole project is overseen by Sid Meier himself  he regularly discusses new ideas and encountered issues with the programmers. So lets see what awaits us in Civilization VI  apart from the obvious fact that its going to devour our time and prompt us to conquer space or at least every neighboring nation, that is.
Cities with a purpose
One of the main new features will be the so-called Expansive Empires  meaning specialized cities, which will be significantly more important than in previous parts. They used to occupy only one hex tile, and had their area of influence. In the new game, agglomerations will be able to occupy adjacent tiles, forming specific districts. Just like in real life, where cities are centered on different purposes (industrial areas full of factories, busy ports associated with thriving commerce, educational centers built around a university, and so on), in Civilization VI well be able to define a specialization for a given place. We can transform adjacent tiles into a scientific campus, where all the big guns of science will do their research and experiments, for instance. We will build industrial, commercial, and even military districts based on the same principle.
Because of that, we will need to be more careful than ever with the selection of the location for establishing cities. In every Civilization game, youre always presented with a brand-new map and you have to explore it, says Ed Beach, [but now] youre going to try to figure out where are your different cities going to go, and what theyre going to be good at. Everything is based on logical decisions  commercial cities ought to be raised on river banks or near the sea; having access to areas rich in natural resources is a good opportunity for starting an industry-oriented city. Utilizing those geographical opportunities will provide significant bonuses: establishing a research center near rain forests and mountains  places that are well-suited for the observation of meteorology and the natural environment  will yield a much greater influx of scientists than building the same center in the middle of nowhere.
A peaceful development of the cities will also have an impact on the other side of the coin, namely war. Carpet bombing and frontal attack on the enemy capital? No, thanks. Now, having a clear view of the structure of enemys industry, it will perhaps be more effective to weaken their production capabilities by taking over their industrial capital, or hampering their scientific progress by capturing the campus. The same goes for the defense  sometimes, when having an inferior army, we will have to decide which districts can be sacrificed, and which we will have to defend at all cost. On the other hand, a well deployed unit may not be as powerful as to capture the whole city, but may prove resourceful enough to cause so much damage that the enemy will need to split their forces, thus rendering their assault less efficient. [This system] can change your choice of target, it can also change your approach, says Andrew Garrett, AI specialist.
Active development and research
Its one of the biggest novelties in Civilization VI, since the research mechanics have remained virtually unchanged for 25 years. The technology tree was almost identical in all five parts of the series: the player could only choose the direction of the research, and then wait for the scientists to do their thing. How to improve, and more importantly, how to diversify this segment of the gameplay? What we felt would be a better system, was if the things that you did in the game world  exploring things and pushing your civilization to new directions  would reflect your progress through the technology tree, said Ed.
How does it work in practice? Each technology has a sort of boost assigned to it, in the form of a mini-quest. Completing it will provide a 50% faster influx of science needed for finishing the given research. Instead of just waiting for the invention of Masonry, you can find stone deposits on the map and start a quarry, and it will get you much closer to the discovery. A nation that has cities and units close to a body of water will make discoveries associated with sea voyage much sooner than an inland nation lacking appropriate boosts. This should transform passive, boring waiting into something interesting, but also something that increases the impression of a coherent and natural development.
Dynamic diplomacy
A peculiar thing about diplomacy in the older games was that it always worked on the same principles, regardless of whether weve just established that the Earth is not carried on a turtles back, or managed to split the atom. It didnt seem too realistic, nor in line with history. Now, the diplomacy is going to undergo changes throughout the ages: from first, primitive contacts (War?! Well, lets do war!!!) to sophisticated administration, ambassadors, attachés, etc. In Civilization VI, the diplomacy aims to show the changes that occurred in international relations over time, but thats not everything. The system is going to be complemented by the so-called agendas, meaning predetermined, specific goals of the policy of a given nation. Each AI leader will have one main agenda and two additional ones that the players will have to discover themselves.
Lets assume that one of the rulers is obsessed with the Worlds Wonders, and would very much like to control all of them; if we decide to compete with them, and will control more Wonders than they do, theres no way they are going to let it slide. Its irrelevant how well the diplomacy will be conducted  some tension will always remain. As soon as we leave the competition, however, we can expect their friendship and support. By discovering who serves which agenda, we can easily predict whos going to be a good ally, and who will become our sworn enemy sooner or later. By looking at these agendas, you change the way the puzzles work, says Andrew Garett. It will always be different, because its a different selection of people each time. If youre really clever and you can use the system well, you might be able to arrange it and set two AIs against each other, sit back, and watch them fight.
The power of combined forces
Reducing the number of units per tile to one had some advantages in Civilization V; it introduced more tactical depth to the combat. We always knew where the artillery, the cavalry, etc. was, hence we were able to strike at the right position. However, it sometimes led to an unbelievably great mess on the map, which became thronged with maneuvering units. In the newest installment, certain military units, labeled as support, will be allowed to share a tile with another unit. Battering rams, siege towers, anti-aircraft and anti-tank units are in fact infantry support formations, so instead of occupying a single tile themselves, they can join another unit in order to make things more convenient in terms of transport and map legibility. Another way to pair units is by providing a soldier as an escort for a settler or a worker  the soldier will then protect the defenseless citizens. Further into the game, the ability to combine a given type of unit into corps, or even armies, will become available, enabling us to control units of different military potential while maintaining the tactical importance of single, specialized formations.
Get some sleep while you can
Weve discussed the most important parts of gameplay that we were able to learn about in out interview with the devs. It was also revealed that the multiplayer will get some polishing as well  it will receive a range of different scenarios that can be finished during one session. Devs from Firaxis havent forgotten about the modders either. While developing the new engine, mod support was taken into consideration from the very beginning, which will surely facilitate the implementation of the mods into the game.
When asked about newcomers to the series, the developers assured us that theres nothing to worry about; thanks to brand-new tutorials, Civilization VI will be very approachable for the new players. Its supposed to be fairly simple at the beginning and become increasingly complex, while revealing deeper layers of the mechanics, further into the game. Were very carefully considering the experience for brand-new players, putting a lot of work on keeping the game very simple in the beginning, explained Ed Beach. A lot of the elements weve talked about are only unlocked as you get deeper into the game.
More details will be revealed as the release date gets closer. The image of the upcoming game that has emerged after our chat with the developers looks most interesting, and theres surely more stuff that Firaxis has got brewing for us. Battlefield 1, also slated for the October release, has just become a number two priority for a lot of people, theres no doubt about that.
It has been a year and a half since I wrote an open letter to President Obama, and started a project called Teachers' Letters to Obama. Back in December of 2009, I sent a package of 107 letters to the President and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan (downloadable here).
Sadly, there has been no change in education policies, and the administration seems more determined than ever to enforce policies that attach ever higher stakes to standardized test scores.
On March 28 of this year, as President Obama began looking towards his reelection in 2012, he held a town hall meeting at a high school. A student named Luis Zelaya asked him if he could help reduce the many tests students were forced to take. The President responded with words that reminded us why teachers had supported him so actively back in 2008. But the words did not correspond with his policies, so the organizers of the Save Our Schools March created a petition, which states:
Our public schools need support. President Obama understands what his daughters need -- occasional low stakes tests used to find out their strengths and weaknesses, and a rich learning environment with lots of engaging projects. Unfortunately the policies of the President's Department of Education are moving us in the wrong direction, towards more tests, with even higher stakes.
If we continue down this path, schools will be completely driven by tests. Scarce resources will be spent on huge expenditures for computers, tests and scoring software, and precious school time will be wasted. Our students will become ever more focused on tests, and less on authentic learning.
With this petition we ask President Obama to bring his education policies in line with the vision he shared on March 28, at the town hall meeting. We invite him to endorse the principles of the Save Our Schools March and National Call to Action, and to speak at our rally in Washington, DC, on July 30, 2011.
To date, 1,570 people have signed this statement, and we have received more than 200 statements expressing their views. These letters have been compiled, and sent to President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. They can be downloaded as a PDF here.
Reading them over, there is a clear sense that emerges. Teachers and parents feel abandoned - even betrayed - by this administration. We were there for you in 2008, President Obama. Where are you now when we need you?
Michael Billingsley
I strongly supported the election of President Obama in 2008. I am a college professor and was able to rally legions of students in support as well. However, if the decisions of his nominated representatives continue to favor high-stakes testing for teacher and student accountability, I will find a new candidate to support in 2012. Please Mr. Obama, get it right on this one. Make the tough decisions and back up the platform for which you were elected.
Caryl Crowell
In a few weeks, I'll be introducing teachers to the Common Core Standards at the request of my county's Regional Support Center, under the County Superintendent of Education's office. I do so with very ambivalent feelings. On the one hand, I support the new focus on comprehension of a variety of texts at all grade levels, something missing under NCLB, and the emphasis also on writing across the curriculum. On the other hand, I've visited the Department of Education's site and read the blueprint for the implementation of the Core Curriculum Standards. I know what's coming - even more onerous testing that we currently endure - something our students, teachers, and schools don't need to tell us how our children are learning. If the current blueprint stands without significant changes as specified in this petition, I won't be able to cast my vote for President Obama when he runs for a second term.
Carolyn Spence
Dear President Obama, I am in my 39th year as an elementary level educator. I am presently a literacy specialist at a Title I school. A majority of our students speak another language and many enter school without the benefit of preschool. Our children hail from many cultures and are wonderful in so many ways. With the onslaught of high-stakes testing, many of them spend their early academic years labeled as "lagging behind". Can you imagine being 7 or 8 and already "failing"? Our teaching staff is motivated and works hard in spite of the challenges our children face at school and at home.
We understand the need for accountability and monitor our students' progress closely. But I worry that if we use high stakes testing data to make judgments about a teacher's effectiveness, good teachers will abandon the schools that need them the most. They will not want to be labeled "failures" and will preserve their careers by teaching less needy populations. That would be a tragedy. We don't need more bureaucracy. We need a society that truly values education and understands that meeting the needs of all children is not a recipe to be legislated by distant parties. I know you think in depth about all the challenges that face our nation. This issue of high stakes testing must be re-examined at the federal and state levels. Please help us!
Nancy Healy
I was a teacher for 30 years and worked hard to foster the kind of learning environment you said you want for your daughters. I felt accountable for every child in my class and measured their progress often, not with a state-mandated grade level test but with assessments based on the content I had taught. When NCLB became law and the consequences of inadequate yearly progress (measuring two unequal groups of students) became dire, I was forced to abandon the methods I believed in for fear my students would not do well enough on the tests. When I moved on to two different charter schools to help with aligning curriculum to the state standards I saw the same results--less innovation and more standardization resulting in less inspired teaching. I decided to opt for early retirement in 2009, discouraged by what I saw happening in Washington. I was hopeful, Mr. President, that you could change the direction of NCLB. But the message from the Department of Education has not been encouraging. Please endorse the principles of Save Our Schools.
Sharon LaCroix-Andersen
Please put a stop to this forced school consolidation. Our town is being forced to close our 2 small elementary schools of in support of a large school. Please show me the data, studies and research that supports that a larger school with larger classes, increased busing, decreased teachers is in the best interest of our children. Please put a stop to the consolidation.
Judith Becker
I supported your campaign and I supported my daughter who trained volunteers for Young Democrats in Stockton, Ca. I am retired from teaching in elementary school in one of the "low-performing" schools. We missed our goal by a tiny percentage in this high-stakes testing charade. We are not teaching science or social studies due to your policies. You do not seem to grasp what you are doing to the poorest students. I am very angry and disappointed.
What do you think of the sentiments expressed here? How do you feel about the way that the Obama administration is handling the nation's schools?
Pro-government protesters gathered on Avenida Paulista, central area of the capital, for an act to support President Dilma RousseffJuca Varella/Agência Brasil
Since Friday (Mar. 18) morning, pro-government protesters gathered on Avenida Paulista, central area of the capital, for an act to support President Dilma Rousseff. Holding flags, banners, and posters, they occupy the midsection space of the São Paulo Museum of Art (MASP). There are also three soundcars. The traffic is stopped at part of the route.
Earlier, the military police fired water cannon to disperse the riot of Rousseff's pro-impeachment group, camped outside the building of the Industrial Federation of São Paulo State (FIESP), one block away from the MASP. Officials feared a conflict between the two groups. On Thursday (Mar. 17), a young sympathizer of the Workers' Party (PT) was assaulted while trying to argue with pro-impeachment protesters, who occupied the avenue since Wednesday (Mar. 16) night.
A leader of the Front to Fight for Housing, Antônia Nascimento, 43, said she believes that to defend the government is a way to prevent setbacks in social improvements achieved in recent years. "In the last decade we have managed to establish some rights. Today, we are aware that they are not as improved as they should, but it's already better than before," she pointed out.
For her, there is no balance among the charges made to PT. "The media spends 24 hours showing what happened in PT, but does not report about the other parties. I'm not saying that the PT is perfect, but that justice needs to be equally get," she said.
Student Jéssica Silva, 16, also believes that the country is on the verge of a coup. "Judge Moro is not helping," she said, referring to the release of telephone conversations of former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva tapped by Operation Car Wash, which, in her view, he did "for personal and parties' interests." For her, it is important to protest." We live an important moment, which I will tell my children and grandchildren. I did not want to watch it on television."
Several leaders addressed, on the top of soundcars, beside the São Paulo Museum of Art (MASP). Called by the Frente Brasil Popular movement, protesters shouted "no to the coup," repeated by speakers sharing the microphone during intervals of singer Chico César's concert, that cheers protesters.
"This is an act gathering all Brazilian authorities, men and women supporting democracy, defending the right of expression, civil liberties. Not defending hatred, not inciting hatred in society. It is not an act of a single social class and it is not an act of a single ethnic group. It is an act of all Brazilians," said Unified Workers' Center (CUT) President Wagner Freitas.
"The coup is against the workers. Every time the workers establish some rights, the right wing tries to end democracy,"said Freitas.
CUT president criticized some communication channels and federal judge Sérgio Moro.
"Moro is giving interviews causing this act, the judge should judge, not be an actor, he is not a political entity. We are against the dictatorship of toga."
Chief of Staff Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva arrived at the protest at around 7pm.

Western diplomats are running out of ways to say that they're angry with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and want him to change his threatening behaviour towards Ukraine. Their words seem to have no effect, and, meanwhile, Eastern Europe continues to drift closer to the kind of conflict it thought it had left behind in the 20th century.
As Russia began surprise military drills along the Ukrainian border Thursday – a move Moscow said it was "forced" to undertake in response to a Ukrainian military crackdown on pro-Russian separatists – Foreign Minister John Baird and his Polish counterpart, Radoslaw Sikorski, searched for new descriptions of the situation.
"Getting worse, not better," was how Mr. Baird put it after the two men discussed the Ukrainian crisis at a meeting here in the Polish capital. "Exacerbating," was the word Mr. Sikorski applied to Russia's latest actions.
Story continues below advertisement
The foreign ministers talked of solidarity with Ukraine, and hinted at new economic sanctions against the Kremlin. But in eastern Ukraine, the slide towards some sort of war continued, with Ukrainian forces moving into the outskirts of the rebel-held city of Slavyansk, resulting in a firefight that reportedly left at least five people dead. Then the troops were swiftly withdrawn, as the Russian drills began and Ukraine's leaders came to believe that an invasion of the country was imminent.
The retreat came shortly after Mr. Putin warned at a forum in St. Petersburg that he would see any use of Ukraine's army against the separatists as a "serious crime." Interim Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov later vowed that the "anti-terrorist operation" would continue in eastern Ukraine. He also demanded an explanation of the Russian military drills.
Canada and Poland have been among Ukraine's staunchest allies throughout the months-old crisis. The two countries have been swiftest and loudest in their denunciations of Mr. Putin, and among the keenest supporters of economic sanctions and other measures targeting the Kremlin.
Mr. Baird and Mr. Sikorski took turns Thursday praising each other for their countries' "principled" stances over Ukraine. But events on the ground in Ukraine showed how little the tough talk and sanctions have accomplished thus far.
U.S. President Barack Obama, speaking during a visit to Japan, said he had more sanctions "teed up" if Russia didn't change its behaviour. But few expect they will have any more impact on the Kremlin's short-term actions than the previous rounds of visa bans and asset freezes targeting members of Mr. Putin's inner circle.
In their remarks, Mr. Baird and Mr. Sikorski were left emphasizing there will be "better days," eventually, for Ukraine – while calling for unity among NATO members, a military alliance that does not include Ukraine.
Mr. Baird departs Warsaw on Friday to visit Latvia and Estonia, two ex-Soviet states with large Russian-speaking populations. The visit is meant as a show of unity with two NATO members that feel threatened by Moscow. The implicit message is that no one is willing to go to war with Russia over Ukraine. The goalposts have shifted to stopping Mr. Putin from going any further.

The West thought it had a struck a deal with Russia last week in Geneva, one that saw all sides – including the Russian and Ukrainian governments – agree to help disarm illegal groups and end the occupation of seized buildings. It was supposed to calm the situation in eastern Ukraine, while the cherry for Russia appeared to be that the deal made no mention of returning the Crimean Peninsula, which it had seized and annexed in March.
But the pro-Russian militants continued to dig in for a fight, while the Ukrainian government appeared reluctant to carry out its end of the deal by ousting the Ukrainian nationalists who still occupy parts of central Kiev two months after the pro-Western revolution there. Amid the rising violence in Slavyansk – which followed a series of kidnappings and killings near the city – the Geneva deal now appears to be in tatters, with Russia and the West trading barbs over which side is not fulfilling it.
Russia, for its part, says the problem in Ukraine is that Mr. Turchynov's government, which came to power after a February revolution that ousted the Moscow-backed government of Viktor Yanukovych, is illegitimate. The Kremlin believes Mr. Turchynov gets his orders from Washington, which – in the Russian narrative – is making a Cold War-style play to gain control of Ukraine. "I am convinced that our American colleagues can and should use their influence to make the present Kiev authorities not just realize but fulfill their responsibility for what is happening," Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Thursday.
"I have for some time thought that they would stop at Crimea," Mr. Baird said in Warsaw. But he said he now felt "a great deal of fear" that Mr. Putin was intent on repeating the Crimea scenario in eastern Ukraine, where Mr. Baird accused Russia of having sent "provocative thugs" to stir up a separatist rebellion.
Mr. Sikorski said that Mr. Putin's Russia – and its new doctrine of protecting Russian speakers beyond its borders – was a threat not just to Ukraine, but to all of Europe. He called for NATO to "get back to basics"
"We listen carefully to what President Putin says, and he seems to be very frank in his intentions. What he says he wants to do is something that all of Europe should be concerned about, because every European country has national minorities, and we have learned over the 20th century that changing borders by force to protect them leads to hell," Mr. Sikorski said in an interview ahead of his meeting with Mr. Baird. "Therefore this kind of ideology is a threat to everyone."

NATO, Mr. Sikorski said, needs "to get back to basics, in response to events that have proved that whereas it's still true that conflict inside the European Union is unthinkable, conflict outside the European Union is not only thinkable, but seems to be growing."
"We should firm up the red line that is treaty-based. Namely that NATO territory is sacrosanct. NATO territory is out of bounds for, sort of, post-Soviet or neo-imperial irredentism," he continued. "We need to, belatedly, make NATO security guarantees credible."
Mr. Sikorski said that to change Mr. Putin's behaviour, it was imperative to take away the Kremlin's energy weapon by reducing Europe's reliance on Russian energy. Like much of Eastern Europe, Poland relies on Russia to supply an overwhelming share of its natural gas.
Mr. Sikorski denied that NATO was effectively abandoning non-members, such as Ukraine, to defend themselves against Russia.
He lamented Poland's failed efforts in recent years to patch up its relationship with Russia by tackling the historical grievances between the two countries that date back centuries. Part of that effort was the creation of the state-funded Centre for Polish-Russian Dialogue and Understanding.
Sitting in his quiet office in central Warsaw, the director of the centre, Slawomir Debski, says he can feel his work coming undone as suspicion of Russia rises among a Polish population that – until 25 years ago – lived under a harsh Communist regime that got its orders in Moscow.

"If we are talking about building confidence between our political elites, our job became much more difficult," Mr. Debski said. "There's no proof right now that the Russians are interested in building confidence with anybody."

The Muslim Personal Law is well balanced for both men and women and it regards human values, says executive member of the AIMPLB
Several women activists and female members of the India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on Thursday insisted that Muslim women are safe under the Shariah laws and there is no need for the government to meddle in their affairs.
"We, the Muslim women from various walks of life, schools of thought and organisations, want to make it clear that the Muslim women are safe and secure under the Muslim Personal Law," Asma Zehra, executive member of the AIMPLB told reporters.
She said the Muslim Personal Law is well balanced for both men and women and it regards human values, and the ruling BJP is raking up the issue of "Triple Talaq" just for electoral gains.
"As the facts stand today, incidence of divorce among the Muslims is the least and same is the case with polygamy. But, in spite of this, it is projected as if the Muslim men have no other job but to pronounce divorce," she said.
She said that marriage is a contract in Islam, prescribing various conditions, and the women have all the rights to change the terms, and if the terms are not favourable, even the Nikah can be declined.
Read: 'Women have the highest status in Islam'
"If she does not say 'qabool hai' (I accept it), no Nikah can be validated," she said.
Zeenath Mehtaab of the Social Reform Committee, New Delhi, pointed out that the incidence of female foeticide, female infanticide, dowry and ostentatious marriages is the least among the Muslims.
For "the people talking about gender equality and gender justice", President of Jamaat-e-Islami Hind Atiya Siddiqui had a few posers.
"Why 50 per cent representation for women is not there in the legislative bodies in India? What is the percentage of women in judiciary, defence forces, IITs and other top institutions," she said.
"We hope that good sense will prevail on the present-day government and the Prime Minister would be magnanimous in withdrawing the affidavit filed before the Supreme Court for interference in the Shariah laws," Zehra said.
A number of other women activists from various states were also present at the conference.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo's LaGuardia Airport AirTrain continues trudging along.
The Port Authority's board approved $55 million in spending Thursday to move the project into its second planning phase — a move that left transit experts confounded.
Despite drawing criticism on nearly every aspect of the proposal, including the AirTrain's route and travel speed estimates, the Port Authority's executive director and chairman defended the project as being vital to a region where 86 percent of all LaGuardia travelers access the airport by car.
“There is no rail access whatsoever, subway or otherwise, to LaGuardia. It is the only major airport on the East Coast that does not have rail access,” Rick Cotton, the executive director who was appointed by Cuomo, told reporters after the board meeting. “The actual alignment is still under discussion, but it is going to go to Willets Point and the framework is that it would be under half an hour from midtown Manhattan to LaGuardia, which is the benefit of the AirTrain.”
Some argue that estimate is a stretch. The AirTrain would run from LaGuardia to the Willets Point, Queens, station where it would serve riders on the 7 line and the Port Washington branch. Yonah Freemark, a transportation blogger, believes that taking the AirTrain would actually be slower than relying on a tandem of existing transit options, including the subway, Long Island Rail Road and bus service.
The AirTrain will also be of little use to Long Islanders, since the Port Washington branch is not accessible to the rest of the LIRR network.
“The project is poorly designed — it will carry passengers in the wrong direction, doing little to reduce travel times, and fail to connect them to most subway lines and commuter rail routes,” Freemark said in an email. “Moreover, it serves a small constituency when the vast majority of New Yorkers simply want better bus and subway service.”

Former Port Authority board member Ken Lipper once called the AirTrain one of the “most ill-conceived projects that I've experienced in government.” But Lipper has since been replaced on the Port Authority's board, and on Thursday the spending was approved without any questions, bringing total planning costs to $75 million.
The Port Authority's capital program estimates that the project itself could cost around $1 billion, though Cotton said a real estimate is not yet known. A lot of concerns around the AirTrain, from costs and routes to ridership, will be addressed in the next planning phase, Cotton said, but the need for a rail link as a congestion solver is apparent.
“The discussion is still premature,” he said, when asked about specific route details. “The point of phase-two planning is to finish the analysis and to consider the pros and cons of the alignment and to get into all the issues … we're working on that. All points of view will be considered.”
On the lack of public dialogue at the meeting, Port Authority Chairman Kevin O'Toole said there had been “really in-depth discussions” about the project and others behind closed doors, and that there is “a lot of enthusiasm” for the project among the board.
“There are a lot of discussions internally,” O'Toole said. “To think we would just willy-nilly vote on any expenditures is probably a wildly inaccurate characterization.”

Midseason Mayhem (MSM) is an invitational tournament that puts an entirely new spin on competitive Rocket League. For one weekend, the standard RLCS rules will be thrown out the window as the Top 16 League Play teams must compete in completely unfamiliar territory.
These pro players will face off in matches containing varying non-regulation arenas, Mutators, and more. The best part is… YOU get to decide where and how they play. For the first time ever in the RLCS, the matches will be almost completely influenced by viewers on our Twitch channel! Adaptation will be the key to walking away with a nice slice of the $10,000 prize pool.
Midseason Mayhem Format
League Play teams will be placed into a single-elimination bracket where best-of-five series will determine who moves on. Prior to each match, viewers will have an opportunity to vote on which non-regulation arenas and predefined Mutator combinations will appear and the teams will have to adapt to in order stay in the tournament. For example, Twitch viewers can vote for the following non-regulation stadiums: Wasteland, Neo Tokyo, Octagon, Double Goal, Cosmic, Pillars, and Utopia Retro.
Here's a quick look at the overall format:
Game 1: Top voted non-regulation arena
Game 2: Runner-up non-regulation arena
Game 3: Top voted Mutator combinations
Game 4: Runner-up Mutator combinations
Game 5: Rumble!
It's worth noting that the Midseason Mayhem tournament does not affect the RLCS standings, so join us to let loose, have some fun, and experience competitive Rocket League like never before! We'll have more details to come when we release the official rules, but make sure you mark your calendars now, the mayhem commences October 8-9th!

Australia will host a two-test International Rules Series next year, while a number of proposed changes have been ratified by the GAA following the recent Central Council.
An updated protocol has been agreed with the Gaelic Players Association and it has been confirmed that Ireland will travel to Australia next November for two games, with the GAA and AFL agreeing in principle to play a return two-Test series back in Ireland in 2019.
Joe Kernan will again take charge of the Irish team and GAA president Aogán Ó Fearghail says it is the fitting for the “success” of the last two series encounters between the sides, with the AFL committing to field a team comprised of only All-Australian players.
"We believe the two-game series is a logical development after the success of the last two single games series, given the distances involved and the potential to generate even more momentum around the games,” he said.
Last Saturday's meeting of Central Council confirmed that there will no semi-finals will be played in the Allianz Football League, while the hurling quarter-finals and semi-finals will finish on the day the games are played avoiding the need for replays.
In an interesting development, if the sides are level after two separate periods of extra time have been played, the outcome will be decided by a free-taking competition.
Both hurling and football finals will be played a fortnight earlier, while a special U17 competition will be organised next year to address the cross-over from U18 minor competitions to U17 in 2018.
Meanwhile as a result of Fingal withdrawing from hurling competitions, there will be no relegation from Division 3A or from the Nicky Rackard Cup.
The mark, which was trialled in the Higher Education League, will be introduced for all football games from 1 January.
We now know young Ernest Hemingway was a sensitive soul but, beneath the machismo for which he became known, the iconic author seemed to have maintained his soft core into his final years. One testament to this was his well-documented love of his cats — he had 23 by 1945. (His first cat, named Snowball, was given to him by a ship's captain and was six-toed; his former home in Key West, Florida, currently houses nearly a hundred descendants of Snowball, about half of whom are polydactyl — an inadvertent lab for inbred genetic mutation.) Hemingway's niece, Hilary Hemingway, writes in the foreword to Hemingway's Cats: An Illustrated Biography (public library) that the author and his fourth wife, Mary, called the cats “purr factories” and “love sponges.”
On February 22, 1953, one of Hemingway's cats, Uncle Willie, was hit by a car. Following the accident, Hemingway sent his close friend Gianfranco Ivancich the following distraught letter:
Dear Gianfranco: Just after I finished writing you and was putting the letter in the envelope Mary came down from the Torre and said, ‘Something terrible has happened to Willie.' I went out and found Willie with both his right legs broken: one at the hip, the other below the knee. A car must have run over him or somebody hit him with a club. He had come all the way home on the two feet of one side. It was a multiple compound fracture with much dirt in the wound and fragments protruding. But he purred and seemed sure that I could fix it. I had René get a bowl of milk for him and René held him and caressed him and Willie was drinking the milk while I shot him through the head. I don't think he could have suffered and the nerves had been crushed so his legs had not begun to really hurt. Monstruo wished to shoot him for me, but I could not delegate the responsibility or leave a chance of Will knowing anybody was killing him… Have had to shoot people but never anyone I knew and loved for eleven years. Nor anyone that purred with two broken legs.

You could forgive the Portland Thorns if, in the face of their competition's complications, they saw a silver lining when news came out this week that Orlando Pride and U.S. women's national team star Alex Morgan was kicked out of Epcot Center at Disney World. According to reports, alcohol was involved, voices arose, and a series of Orlando City players joined their more famous company in being asked to leave the park.
Before this story broke, the buildup to Saturday's National Women's Soccer League semifinal between Morgan's Pride and her previous club, the Thorns, was likely to rehash the past: three seasons that both sides would, for the most part, prefer stay behind them. When, Morgan parted ways with her first NWSL team two years ago, she did so with a championship ring, but she also left amid growing questions. Why had the Thorns, recognized as the most talented team in the league, never finished higher than third in the regular season? By the time Portland drifted to sixth and out of the playoffs in her final season with the club, Morgan was seen as part of the problem.
It would leave Morgan returning home for the final, potentially winning a trophy that would cast her Thorns departure in a completely new light. It would also leave Portland without a playoff victory since she left.
The Thorns' issues always went well beyond Morgan, but she was emblematic, be that of the team's inability to get its tactics right or the tense but cool detente that seemed to exist behind the scenes. While she was at the club, it always seemed caught in a polarized world, one where team dynamics vacillated between the quiet, no-nonsense leadership of Christine Sinclair and the gravity of Morgan's stardom. While many players tried to bridge the gaps that existed between the team's poles, the team's results spoke to a three-year decay of the Thorns' ethos.
During that time, Morgan went from nine goals scored to six, then down to only one in her final year. Injuries limited her to only 38 games over that time, though she managed to play a major part in the 2015 World Cup. By the time she left Portland, all sides were ready to move on, with fan skepticism matching the resignation both player and club felt.
Had Portland not received such a ransom for Morgan in its trade with Orlando in October 2015, there may have been a feeling of regret; or, at least, some wish-casting at what might have been.
But in the wake of Morgan's departure, in a series of moves where she was the biggest (but not only) part, the Thorns were able to bring in Lindsey Horan, Meghan Klingenberg, Emily Sonnett and, with the international spots they acquired, pave the way for the arrivals of Amandine Henry and Nadia Nadim. Other assets went out to acquire those players, but in dealing Morgan, Portland created the flexibility to complete its overhaul and leveraged those changes to claim the 2016 Shield.
That success meant the Thorns never had a need to reminisce over Morgan's time in the Rose City; on the contrary, here departure became a line of delineation. Morgan spoke of the opportunity to become a captain in Orlando, lauding all the other virtues that came with a new start, and the Thorns quickly turned their focus to the success they'd expected from day one. When the team hosted its first playoff game in club history later that season, a certain vindication came over the club. Portland, the results said, was right to move on.
Embedded video for Pride on the line: Will Alex Morgan haunt the Portland Thorns?
In that vindication, though, there's also contrast, as well as expectations. Beneath the huge crowd that showed up to see last year's semifinal against the visiting Western New York Flash was reminder of wasted time, that Portland would have been hosting similar celebrations had it not spent three years in confusion. Fair or not, those years, in the minds of those who follow the Thorns, will always be anchored to Alex Morgan.
That's something Morgan is unlikely to change, but come Saturday, it's a narrative she has a chance to offset. If the underlying theory behind Portland's first three seasons is that Morgan was part of the problem, then what better way to defy that logic than to return to her old home, play as well as she has throughout this summer's NWSL return, and hand Portland its second consecutive home playoff loss? It would leave Morgan, walking victoriously away from what's become hostile ground, to return home for next week's final, potentially winning a trophy that would cast her Thorns departure in a completely new light.
It would also leave Portland without a playoff victory since she left. The last time the Thorns would have won a playoff game? Four years ago, in Rochester, New York, where Morgan and her teammates helped claim the inaugural NWSL title.
It would complete the 180-degree turn from the 2016 offseason, when Portland built a Shield-winner with the proceeds from the game's biggest star. As Orlando struggled to a ninth-place finish and Morgan netted only four times in 15 games, the Thorns had every reason to think their decision to move on would never come back to haunt them.
Now, that haunting is near. Alex Morgan is not only back, but she's back and better than she ever was in Portland. If she can lead the Pride to victory at Providence Park, an entirely new context gets built around her time with the Thorns.

NOT READY FOR WINDOWS 10! Still solid though..
Great Nook APP. HOWEVER! Ever since I upgraded to Windows 10 I cant read entire pages. The sentences get cut off or the application doesn't allow you to scroll downward to see the rest of the lines or content. I'm using the application on my PC. I still haven't upgraded my tablet from Windows 8 to 10 so I'll continue using that in the meantime but this is a major bummer! If you have Windows 10 It's probably best you DO NOT download since you wont be able to read all of your paid content. Wait for the next patch or update from nook saying that it has fixed the issue for Windows 10 users. I give this app a 4 star because it really is good and hopefully once its been updated it will stay that way. I didn't give it 5 stars because of that issue plus it occasionally lags when trying to highlight or make adjustments to your notes. Again Solid app, just needs to be updated asap for the millions that probably read or use it.

Herman Cain has taken to telling Christian audiences an anecdote in which he feared being seen by a doctor with the last name Abdallah during his cancer treatments until he learned the doctor was Christian. Yahoo News's Chris Moody quotes Cain telling the story to an audience at The Holy Land Experience, a Christian-themed amusement park in Florida:
I said to his physician assistant, I said, 'That sounds foreign--not that I had anything against foreign doctors--but it sounded too foreign," Cain tells the audience. "She said, 'He's from Lebanon.' Oh, Lebanon! My mind immediately started thinking, wait a minute, maybe his religious persuasion is different than mine! She could see the look on my face and she said, 'Don't worry, Mr. Cain, he's a Christian from Lebanon.'" "Hallelujah!" Cain says. "Thank God!"
Dave Weigel at Slate notes that Cain has told this story before. He reminds readers (and perhaps Cain?) that Lebanon is actually about 35 percent Catholic or Orthodox Christian, and writes, "You're left to wonder what would have happened had the doctor been a Muslim or a Druze or something. You're also left asking: Uh, why does Cain think this story's such a home run with Christian audiences?"
Watch him tell the story back in February here:

The revolution is already tearing itself apart.
Less than a week before its official launch on Wednesday, Bernie Sanders' new political group is working its way through an internal war that led to the departure of digital director Kenneth Pennington and at least four others from a team of 15, and the return of presidential campaign manager Jeff Weaver as the group's new president.
Story Continued Below
“Kenneth chose to leave the organization. He'd worked on the campaign from the very beginning … he decided to do something else I guess,” Weaver said Monday evening, but “we're very happy to be putting the A-team back together.”
People familiar with what occurred say that the board, which is chaired by the Vermont senator's wife Jane, was growing increasingly concerned about campaign finance questions being raised over the last week. Their concern reached a breaking point, one person deeply involved with the Sanders world said, with a story last Friday from ABC News about how the group would handle the particular tax questions raised by having a senator so closely associated with a 501(c)4 nonprofit organization that has strict restrictions on its political work.
Underlying all this, though, are deep, still-raw tensions left over from the presidential campaign which by the end had become a war between the older aides who felt that their experience and planning explained Sanders' ability to translate his message into votes, and younger aides who felt dismissed by older aides whom they felt didn't appreciate how much of what Sanders achieved was because of their digital and organizing prowess, which turned the senator into a sensation.
Weaver shrugged off the suggestion that the group was already falling victim to a caricature of liberal infighting.
“This is an organization that's a couple of weeks old, and every new organization has to find its footing,” he said.
There isn't an aide closer to Bernie and Jane Sanders than Weaver. But he became a lightning rod for the criticism of the younger generation who felt that he was curt, dismissive, and overmatched. So when Jane Sanders asked Weaver, who was already involved as a legal adviser to Our Revolution, to take on a greater role early last week — before the ABC News story — Pennington and others immediately protested. They issued what amounted to an ultimatum: him or them.
“A majority of the staff quit as a result of Jeff joining,” said one person familiar with the situation, who added that they had joined with a promise from Bernie and Jane Sanders, and executive director Shannon Jackson, that Weaver wouldn't be running it and had asked for this promise specifically.
They claim as well that there was a specific argument about fundraising strategy.
Weaver said he had a vision that included more traditional — not just grassroots — fundraising, the person familiar with the situation said.
"It's about both the fundraising and the spending: Jeff would like to take big money from rich people including billionaires and spend it on ads," said Claire Sandberg, who was the digital organizing director of the campaign and the organizing director of Our Revolution (whose entire department of four left) before quitting. "That's the opposite of what this campaign and this movement are supposed to be about and after being very firm and raising alarm the staff felt that we had no choice but to quit."
The argument came to a boil in a conference call last week between Pennington, Weaver and Jane Sanders. After airing his complaints about Weaver without managing to move the senator's wife, Pennington decided to quit — along with key staffers from the organizing, data, outreach and political teams with him.
Though Jackson, who was until recently the senator's body man, will remain the executive director, the staff walkout leaves Our Revolution understaffed and with giant holes to be filled just days before the formal kickoff event, which will consist of a series of house parties that Sanders will address via livestream.
“The board asked me last week to come in and be the head. I'm very proud to do it,” Weaver said. “The board knew that I shared Bernie's vision and I'd be true to it.”
One of the staffers who left described multiple phone calls and emails to board members expressing their dismay.
"Over the last few days, almost the entire staff resigned from the organization because they would not work for Jeff Weaver or help to enact Jeff's vision for the organization in any way,” the former staffer said.
Also coming back aboard is Revolution Messaging, the firm that was the backbone of the Sanders campaign's fundraising and outreach operation. Pennington had often sparred with Revolution Messaging during the campaign, with the person deeply involved in Sanders world describing Pennington as trying to hog credit. That came to a head, according to several sources, when, under Pennington's direction, Revolution Messaging was not retained to be part of Our Revolution. The firm didn't design the website or any of the emails that have gone out for Our Revolution to date.
Reached by email Monday, Pennington declined to discuss what occurred with his departure in detail. He disputed that he had done anything but share credit, arguing that seeing it otherwise was “taking Jeff's word.”
“Rev is great. Tim [Tagaris], Michael [Whitney], and Robin [Curran] certainly are the A-Team when it comes to email fundraising,” Pennington wrote in the email. “Can't think of anyone I'd rather have.”
Our Revolution is aiming to have a long term impact on races all the way down to the most local. They say they're hoping to start this year, getting the voters activated by Sanders involved in Senate, House and other campaigns.
But Sanders himself has yet to campaign for any candidates whatsoever aside from one rally for Eric Kingson — a New York House hopeful who subsequently lost his primary to the Democratic party's favored contender.
Sanders' attempts to get his work for other candidates off the ground has already been sputtering. Around the time he campaigned for Kingson, for example, Zephyr Teachout specifically asked him not to come and campaign for her until he ironed out his eventual endorsement of Hillary Clinton.
Revolution Messaging is already working with the campaigns of Zephyr Teachout in New York and Tim Canova in Florida, which according to the firm's analysis on Open Secrets are the House candidates with the highest small-dollar donor percentages. Sanders has vocally supported Canova, who is challenging former Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
Revolution Messaging argues that this shows it's already proven how to model the presidential campaign's success down-ballot.
"We're honored to begin a new chapter with Our Revolution to support Sen. Sanders' vision to elect progressive candidates up and down the ballot,” said Revolution Messaging founder and CEO Scott Goodstein. “Looking forward to getting the band back together."
Still, even the case of Canova is far from a clean example of Sanders' potential down-ballot influence: his campaign's top media advisors—Tad Devine, Mark Longabaugh, and Julian Mulvey, who were also top players on the Sanders campaign—left the Canova camp less than two weeks after joining it earlier this month. And polls show Canova well behind Wasserman Schultz.
Weaver said he is optimistic.
“Millions of people voted for Bernie Sanders, hundreds of thousands volunteered, millions donated,” he said. “People are very excited about continuing the work that was done on the campaign and making sure we bring Bernie's progressive vision to reality.”
AstraZeneca is to investigate the potential of cancer-killing viruses as part of a deal with a small US biotech.
MedImmune, an arm of the FTSE 100 drugmaker, has announced a deal with Minnesota-based Omnis Pharmaceuticals to develop and, if successful, sell treatments using the smaller company's cancer-killing virus technology.
The collaboration will allow MedImmune to investigate whether it can use Omnis's "oncolytic viruses" - which have been engineered to infect and kill tumour cells while leaving healthy tissue alone - to deliver its own experimental cancer treatments to tumour cells.
MedImmune hopes that a set of its experimental drugs, which enhance the body's immune response to tumour cells, can be made more powerful, and less risky to healthy cells, by being dispatched directly to tumour cells by viruses.
Oncolytic viruses are still a fairly nascent area of cancer research. No such treatments are yet available in the West despite Chinese biotech Shanghai Sunway winning the world's first approval for an oncolytic virus in 2005. America's Amgen hopes to become the first company to win approval for an oncolytic virus in the West after submitting its therapy to EU medicine regulators in September.
Dr Edward Bradley, senior vice president of research and development at MedImmune, added that his company's drugs could in turn enhance the cancer-killing abilities of Omnis's viruses.
Stephen J. Russell, chief executive of Omnis, said combining the two group's technologies would result in an unusual collaboration between viruses and the immune system, which are "usually in conflict with one another, to combat another resourceful adversary, the tumour".
AstraZeneca and Omnis did not disclose the financial details of the agreement.

Transport for London (TfL) will be handing out FREE bottles of water to commuters using the London Underground for the third year in a row.
As a mini heatwave hits the capital , Danone has given TfL 250,000 bottles of water to hand out at selected stations, starting on July 19 at Farringdon Station.
The giveaway is part of TfL's ongoing Travel Better London campaign, which aims to raise awareness of how passengers can help to reduce delays and improve journeys for everyone by making small changes which can prevent people being taken ill on trains.
It also coincides with the hot weather that is forecast for London for the coming week.
The free bottles of water are also part of London Underground's plans to try and cool the network, which have included air conditioned trains on the Metropolitan, Circle, Hammersmith and City and District lines, upgraded station ventilation and portable fans installed in ticket and concourse areas.
Mark Evers, director of customer experience for the London Underground, said: "Through our partnership with Danone we want to encourage customers to carry water when they travel during the summer, which can help prevent people being taken ill on trains and reduce delays.
"This partnership complements our ongoing investment in cooling the Tube, which includes improving ventilation systems at our stations and introducing new air conditioned trains, which will serve 40% of the underground network by the end of this year."
U.S. Emissions, Economic Growth Headed Toward Divorce
Call them a couple: The U.S. economy and energy consumption, along with the greenhouse gas emissions they create, have always grown and plunged together. But as the U.S. embraces energy efficiency and renewables, those things aren't dancing to quite the same beat anymore. In fact, they're “decoupling,” and could be heading toward a permanent divorce.
New data from the U.S. Department of Energy shows that overall U.S. energy consumption is slowing and is not expected to grow much at all over the next 25 years despite both a growing economy and population. Overall, U.S. energy consumption is expected to grow 0.3 percent annually between now and 2040. That's half the expected U.S. population growth rate and dramatically less than the projections for U.S. economic growth through 2040 — 2.4 percent. Greenhouse gas emissions from burning energy are expected to grow 0.1 percent in that time.

U.S. energy consumption declined when the recession hit, but with big advancements in energy efficiency and growth in renewables, Americans just aren't burning quite as much energy as they used to even in a growing economy.
“Within a recession, people ask, won't we resume a growth path? We're saying we don't think so — not a decline path, but basically a plateau,” U.S. Energy Information Administration analyst Jim Turnure said.
The details look like this: Thanks to an embrace of energy efficiency, residential energy consumption won't likely grow at all over the next 25 years. With more Americans driving electric cars and more energy efficient vehicles, energy use in the transportation sector will decline just slightly as gasoline consumption dives more than 20 percent by 2040. Industrial energy use will grow about 0.7 percent.
That's good news for the climate because the energy intensity of the economy is declining, which means greenhouse gas emissions are likely to grow at only a fraction of the rate that the economy is expected to grow in the coming years.
Michael Mann, climate researcher and director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University, said in March that the U.S. still needs to create a larger gap between greenhouse gas emissions and economic growth.

“I'm hopeful this is the beginning of a trend,” he said, referring to emissions in the U.S. “The fact that countries like Germany have so dramatically lowered their carbon emissions with mechanisms like feed-in tariffs that incentivize non-fossil-fuel energy, and the fact that the West Coast and Northeast states here in the U.S. are investing more in renewable energy, means that we ought to be seeing a decrease in emissions. Now it appears that we are seeing this in the numbers.”
Turnure said this lack of growth in energy use in the U.S. leads to a big question about the future of energy and innovation, to which there is no clear answer.
“We wonder if the slowdown in consumption can affect the pace of investment (in new energy technology markets),” he said. “If nobody needs to get any new energy production, might that slow down the market for new technology and technological improvement?”

After a hundred thousand votes and a lot of gamer support, the controversial isometric shooter from Destructive Creations has officially been approved to appear on Steam. The game Hatred kicked up tons of fuss when it first landed on Greenlight and the radical moral police threw a hissy fit and wanted it removed from Steam. Well, after a lot of huffing and puffing and community support, Hatred has officially been greenlit to appear on the Steam store. That's right, if Destructive Creations has a real game to sell, they can sell it on Steam.
Over on the official Greenlight page for Hatred, the game has been flagged as getting the thumbs-up approval by Valve to appear on their store.
The game was originally dismissed from Steam on December 15th after being submitted earlier that morning. The outcry from the anti-gamers – and yes, the anti-gamers are mostly gaming websites and media outlets that cover tech and electronic entertainment news – tried shaming Valve into banning Hatred from Steam following their previous praise of GTA V being removed from Target and Kmart in Australia.
Gamers have recognized that their major media outlets they used to go to for information and news are actually their number one enemy at the moment; gamers had to rally together and petition hard to get Hatred back on Greenlight.
The great and powerful GabeN – Gabe Newell – came to the rescue; swooping in on his Glorious Corsair Cooled steed, sending strong freedom of speech message to the developers that their game, Hatred, would be allowed on Steam.
The based levels blew off the charts and gamers exclaimed that the great GabeN had come to save the day. With that, Hatred was reinstated on Steam Greenlight and became the number one game on the service.
Today – whether you approve of the content in the game or not – we celebrate the right to freedom of speech and creativity by developers with the approval of Hatred having the option to appear on the Steam store. No matter where you stand on the content in the game (even though it's just a higher-fidelity version of the original Postal, which was a very serious murder simulator back in the day) you at least have to appreciate that fanboys and fangirls from all walks of gaming came together to ensure that a developer's creative vision was not hampered by the corrupt moral police.
You can learn more about Hatred by visiting the official Greenlight page. Warning: it's not for everyone.
Michigan State defensive coordinator Pat Narduzzi will be the next head coach at Pitt, according to a source with knowledge of the situation. The deal has yet to be finalized and is not expected not be announced until after Christmas. Barring any eleventh-hour breakdown, Narduzzi will be announced following the Christmas holiday.
Narduzzi is considered the top defensive coordinator in the country, and he received the 2013 Frank Broyles award for the nation's top assistant coach. He has led the Spartans to a top 10 finish in the NCAA's total defense statistics for each of the past four years.
• STAPLES: Big Ten out to revamp reputation in bowl season
Narduzzi topped a field that included Marshall head coach Doc Holliday, Ohio State co-defensive coordinator Luke Fickell and Pittsburgh assistant Joe Rudolph. Narduzzi interviewed for the Colorado State job in Las Vegas on Sunday night but declined interest in order to pursue the position at Pitt. Yahoo Sports first reported that he was emerging as the leader at Pitt.​ He replaces Paul Chryst, who left to become Wisconsin's head coach last week. Chryst's departure led to the removal of athletic director Steve Pederson.
Narduzzi will be Pittsburgh's fifth head coach since 2010, but the Panther's move to the ACC in 2013 and Chryst's three-year tenure have brought relative stability to the program recently. Chryst posted a 19-19 record, reaching a bowl game in all three years. The Panthers went 6-6 this season, including a 4-4 mark in ACC play, and will play Houston in the Armed Forces Bowl on Jan. 2.
Narduzzi will inherit a team rife with young talent, including All-America tailback James Conner, talented receiver Tyler Boyd and quarterback Chad Voytik, all of whom will be juniors next season.

JST 7 (60 Singles Entrants) – 5/23/2015, Rosmalen, the Netherlands
JST 7 was the first 2-day tournament that has taken place in the Netherlands for many years. There were 60 Melee singles entrants from mostly the Netherlands, Germany and the UK, including Ice, Amsah, VwS. Professor Pro and LLL.Jeapie. Most of the Dutch top players were missing at this event, which gave the subtop a chance to put themselves in the picture. The biggest surprise in Melee singles was $tijn, a Dutch fox player who keeps improving, beating fellow Dutchman Jim Morrison before losing to Jeapie in losers quarters. In losers semis, Jeapie came extremely close to knockout Prof. Pro, being 2 stocks ahead with a 2-1 lead in games. Prof managed to come back though and then convincingly take game 5 aswell. Amsah managed to take 1 game from Ice in winners finals, but got 3-0'd in grand finals. In teams though Amsah and Ice teamed together, but lost the grand finals to Professor Pro and Jeapie.

Silicon Valley is currently fueling a future food product blitz, and one of the most intriguing plays yet isn't fake meat or sci-fi-tinged full-meal substitutes—it's iPhone-controlled hydroponics. Today, a European food technology startup Niwa is debuting a "smart food tech device which will turn your house into a smartphone controlled greenhouse," according to one of its founders. The product is essentially a small, slick-looking hydroponic farm you can set up to grow plants of every stripe in your living room.
A couple weeks ago, I noticed I'd received an email with the blunt declaration "The future of food is not Soylent" in the subject line. The message turned out not to be hate mail regarding my Soylent piece—which I got plenty of, from both proponents and opponents of the controversial food replacement—but from a founder of Niwa.
The company was in full pitch mode; its representative exhorted that the food of the future is fresh, home-grown produce, cultivated with the help of cutting-edge gadgets and the connectivity sure to arrive with the age of the smart home.
"We use advanced technology to stimulate the best possible environment for your plants," co-founder Aga Nazaruk wrote, "for the first time you can take care of your plants from your smartphone, understand its progress and interact with them or just put it on autopilot." She said a consumer could grow anything, "from timeless tomatoes and peppers to strawberries, orchids and medical plants." The corresponding app "will load a specific program setting up the right values for your plant."
"No green thumb needed," she added.
Naturally, Niwa is starting a Kickstarter campaign for what it calls the "first smartphone-controlled growing system." The company is asking for $100,000 in funds—notably, the same amount that the Soylent crew aimed for—and is offering a range of Niwa hydroponic systems as rewards. $199 will snag supporters a small in-home greenhouse; $399 gets you a large one.
In an email interview with Niwa's founder, 32-year-old Javier Morrillias, the entrepreneur told me the idea was born out of a frustration with our inneficient globalized food system, and from firsthand experience growing up in a region that's one of the world's top producers of vegetables.
"Everyday, I would watch 2000 trucks filled with different vegetables leaving [my] home town Almeria in Spain to travel 2000 km on average and be delivered to various countries across Europe," he wrote. "Almeria is the largest producer of tomatoes on earth with hydroponic greenhouses visible from space," he said. "I started working with agricultural experts to see how it can take that advance technology and put it in hands or ordinary people so they can grow their own food at ease. After 2 years of research and development, multiple prototypes and trials we finally created niwa."
Though the substance of his replies were often clearly pulled from pre-existing press materials, they nonetheless describe an interesting project, so I'll bite:
Niwa is based in hydroponic technology – a soilless way to grow plants, where the plant is taking nutrients directly form water. The most important part of Niwa is its brain – a powerful microcontroller loaded with custom made software which has all the knowledge of an experienced farmer, so you don't need to worry about when to water your plants or what is the ideal temperature to get more juicy tomatoes, Niwa knows...
It uses an array of sensors and actuators to create the perfect growing environment for your plants controlling humidity, temperature, and light as well as watering... Niwa is constantly gathering feedback from the sensors but also from the user. Each plant needs different conditions at different stages of growth. In order to know which phase your plants are accurately, the app will ask you simple questions like “Can you see flowers?”. If you answer “yes”, a new stage and new settings are triggered. This creates superior performance and ensures that your plants will grow strong and healthy
You make those responses and control the settings from the attendant smartphone app, which also allows you to remotely track and understand your plant's progress. "More seasoned growers can use the system for incubation, experimentation or create and share their own growing settings with the community," Morrillias says. And yes, some of those more seasoned growers will surely be interested in growing more than tomatoes or strawberries.
The system uses a compact fluorescent lamp, and its maximum consumption is 200 watts when the heater and light are on. Morrillias says an LED version that will use even less power is on the way. The system utilizes a reservoir of water that must be refilled every other week.
"With hydroponics and our current range of sizes, you can grow just about anything that will fit inside the tray (no trees though—we've already tried! And no root vegetables). This includes most house plants, flowers, and vegetables, several kinds of fruits and various herbs and medicinal plants."
The company, which is usually based in the UK, is currently operating out of Shenzen, China, as part of the hardware startup incubator Haxlr8tr. The first Niwa units are slated to ship in March 2015.
It's a smart, fun product, and nice to see the startup crowd trying its hand at high-tech gardening: The slick interface and smartphone interactivity may yet spawn a few new local food aficionados. It'd be ideal for urban eaters, like me—I might garden if my apartment came with a yard—as it's also relatively affordable. That said, as tends to be the case with every startup ever, some of its bold claims are a little over the top: it's unlikely a single, little hydroponic farm could meet a significant portion of a family's daily vegetable needs.
If successful, the true benefit of Niwa will be that it offers users a novel, gadget-laden path to a hands-on experience with food production. Strip out the buzzwords, and Niwa is essentially pitching gardening to the hacker crowd. If 'Buy Local' and 'Eat Organic' sound too hippie, they're insinuating, maybe something like 'Use your phone to grow your own' could stand to catch on.

In this unprecedented era of menstrual activism, invention, and public discourse, it was only a matter of time before period talk reached outer space. Last week, in a report published in Npj Microgravity, researchers made one of the first scientifically backed recommendations for astronauts who menstruate.
Hormonal contraception makes it possible for women to halt their periods, but with the prospect of yearslong space missions looming, the authors of the paper advise against taking birth control pills. The bulk of hundreds or thousands of days' worth of oral contraception and their packaging would create unnecessary weight and waste on the ship, and scientists have not studied the long-term effects of deep-space radiation on hormonal pills. Thus, the researchers recommend long-acting reversible contraception like an intrauterine device or arm implant—preferably the former, since the latter might catch on or otherwise interfere with space garments.
The male-dominated astronautics community has touched on the issue of menstruation in spaceflight before, but discussions often relied on sexist assumptions and unchallenged misconceptions. Some officials wondered why women needed to be considered for space missions in the first place. In 1971, as NPR reported last year, a NASA paper about psychological issues for astronauts suggested women be used as stress-relief tools:
The question of direct sexual release on a long-duration space mission must be considered. Practical considerations (such as weight and expense) preclude men taking their wives on the first space flights. It is possible that a woman, qualified from a scientific viewpoint, might be persuaded to donate her time and energies for the sake of improving crew morale; however, such a situation might create interpersonal tensions far more dynamic than the sexual tensions it would release.
In this climate, menstruation was pegged more as an emotional liability than a physical one. According to Cecil Adams at the Straight Dope, “several plane crashes in the 1930s had involved menstruating female pilots, and experts—male experts, of course—suggested that putting a woman with ‘menstrual disturbances' in the cockpit was an invitation to disaster.” Once women did make it to the top of the U.S. astronaut program, scientists worried that menstruating in microgravity might cause menstrual fluid to flow upwards, from the uterus into the Fallopian tubes and out into the abdomen. They predicted that this phenomenon, called retrograde menstruation, could cause endometriosis, a painful syndrome wherein uterine tissue grows outside the uterus.
Astronaut Rhea Seddon, who flew in the '80s and '90s, says no one commissioned a study to prove or disprove this theory, which she and her fellow female astronauts found absurd. “We said, ‘How about we just consider it a non-problem until it becomes a problem?' ” she recounted in an oral history. They continued: “‘If anybody gets sick in space you can bring us home. Then we'll deal with it as a problem, but let's consider it a non-problem.'”
There is no evidence that retrograde menstruation could occur in microgravity, nor that, if it did, it would cause endometriosis. Women who've menstruated in space have all reported that everything went fine, just like menstruating on the ground. That makes sense: No doctor has ever suggested that women should not do cartwheels, lie down with their hips raised, or perform yoga inversions during their periods, which would exert a greater negative force on the contents of the uterus than zero-gravity would.
Still, for purposes of travel weight, waste disposal, and astronaut comfort, suppressing menstruation as recommended by last week's report seems to be the best option. But there is one major downside: It might deprive the men of NASA of a significant learning opportunity. Just before Sally Ride became the first U.S. woman in space, the mission's male engineers, who took it upon themselves to design a makeup kit for her, asked her how many tampons she'd need for a one-week mission. “Is 100 the right number?” they asked. “No,” Ride answered. “That would not be the right number.”
One IUD can last for up to five years, thankfully making candy-jar guesses from clueless scientists a thing of the past.*

THE pitted stretch of road just north of Gramercy Park between Lexington and Fifth Avenues was recently repaved. Roads are a quintessential public good, and though New York City's leave much to be desired, their condition has vastly improved under Michael Bloomberg, the city's soon-to-be-departing mayor. But something was lost in this specific improvement: the painted strip of bike lane. Were Mr Bloomberg continuing in office, there is little doubt that the bike lane would be restored. It could still happen, but the fate of bike lanes and bicycling in New York is now in question with the election of Bill de Blasio as mayor.
Mr Bloomberg did not enter office as an advocate of cycling. Early questions about bikes were referred to Iris Weinshall, Mr Bloomberg's first transportation commissioner (a holdover from the Giuliani administration). The number of bike lanes increased during Ms Weinshall's tenure, but the execution was sloppy. Even obvious problems, like routing cyclists away from the entrance to bridges, were ignored or botched. Cycling was for the brave, if not the insane.

It was not until 2007, when Janette Sadik-Khan took over for Ms Weinshall (who would go on to oppose a bike lane near her home in Brooklyn), that cycling really took off in the city. The introduction of short-term rental bikes has been a spectacular success. Users range from tourists to businesspeople to grocery shoppers. The Citibikes, as they're called, would not be so useful were it not for other improvements made by Ms Sadik-Khan. New bike lanes were established, old lanes improved and rules passed requiring garages and buildings to accept bikes (though some buildings, like The Economist's midtown offices, subvert the rules by charging staggering amounts for the use of their lifts).
Still, New York remains a crazy place to cycle, with taxis stopping abruptly and awkwardly in bike lanes, and the ever-present possibility of being “doored”. But the obstacles need to be seen in context. For decades bikers were targeted practice for sloppy or crazed drivers and consequently scarce. Your correspondent was almost alone cycling to elementary school in the 1960s. In the 1980s and 1990s, a trip over the Brooklyn Bridge included just a few other commuters. Now clever cyclists avoid the Brooklyn Bridge entirely because of the bike traffic. There are cyclists everywhere in the city.
Not everyone is happy about the emerging bike culture. Joe Lhota, who lost to Mr de Blasio, said his polling showed a huge schism in the popularity of bikes: staggering support among voters under 40 and opposition among older voters. It is not hard to find reasons for complaints. Many bikers not only break traffic laws, they do so egregiously. Cars and trucks are miserable at having to give up space to bikers on already-packed streets. Efforts to reduce traffic through congestion pricing have come up against complaints that it discriminates against the poor. When it comes to the streets, there are many competing interests.
The expansion of bike access is often perceived to be a component of activist government. But the public costs of bikes, while not zero, are low compared to the public costs of other forms of transportation. The city's bus and subway systems require enormous subsidies. For structural and political reasons it is difficult to adjust routes in response to demand. The medallion system providing franchises to taxis would be considered corrupt were the legislators determining corruption not also receiving contributions from medallion owners. Cars pollute, take up lots of space and are dangerous.
For the city's bike culture to continue to grow, Mr de Blasio's administration must not only be as supportive as the Bloomberg administration but as competent. There are doubts, not least because Mr de Blasio received strong support from the taxi lobby. But if the bike lanes are allowed to fade, there will be a reaction from the increasing number of city cyclists and their supporters. While attention is now focused on who will head the police department, and then education, a large group also awaits word of Ms Sadik-Khan's replacement. In the meantime, they're watching the writing on the road.

These days, we take it for granted that television can be as good as movies (or live theater) and that great actors can deliver indelible performances on the small screen. Especially when it comes to science fiction and fantasy. But it took a small number of pioneering actors to show what's actually possible in genre television, and to expand our horizons.
Here are the 10 performances that helped to define the possibilities of science fiction and fantasy television, for everyone. In particular, these are performances that became emblematic of the genre as a whole, and showed what it was possible to do with stock roles like "quirky alien" or "mad scientist."
I tried to keep this list balanced between different eras, so it's not just dominated by recent performances. And I pretty much guarantee we're not going to be able to list all of your favorite performances here — so pipe up in the comments with your own selections!
1. Leonard Nimoy (Star Trek)
Sure, William Shatner's performance in the original Star Trek is also emblematic, and often-imitated — but Nimoy took a supporting role and made it a touchstone for generations of viewers. And like a lot of the other actors on this list, Nimoy was playing a common science fiction "type" — the impassive alien — and he took it to a different place. Before Spock, science fiction was full of emotionless aliens who spoke in a monotone or imitated a stereotypical "computer" inflection. Nimoy gave a whole range of nuances to the Vulcan role, conveying a lot of different stuff with every raised eyebrow or furrowed brow. Nimoy's Spock never seemed to have emotions, as we understood them — but he still had a range, and moods. A huge host of sympathetic aliens on television owe their genesis to Spock.

2) Patrick Troughton (Doctor Who)
William Hartnell was the original star of Doctor Who, of course, and to watch Hartnell's patented "crotchety old man" performance is to be thrilled. But Patrick Troughton, who had the impossible task of taking over the role from Hartnell, really defined the Doctor's range, as a character. Every other actor who's played the Doctor since 1969 has been furnishing the house that PatrickTroughton built — from the sly subversive humor, to the capacity for immense brooding darkness when faced with ultimate evil. Watch a Troughton episode and a Matt Smith episode back to back, and you'll see Troughton's influence in every emotional shift that Smith pulls off. Not only that, but Troughton brought so much warmth and weirdness to the Doctor, he opened up a lot more space for similar "quirky" alien/scientist roles to display a lot of extra facets. A million science fiction character actors owe Patrick Troughton a huge debt. Although if you're judging purely in terms of the most "emblematic" performance, Tom Baker definitely deserves a nod as well.

3. Jacqueline Pearce (Blake's 7)
The late 1970s and early 1980s saw a renaissance for science fiction megalomaniacs, both on television and in movies. And a lot of them were female, including Princess Ardala in Buck Rogers in the 25th Century and Diana in V. But the best of the bunch might well have been Servalan, the fascist oppressor in this low-budget British show. Blake's 7 was only on the air for four years, but it's had an enduring influence on both sides of the Atlantic — and Pearce's insane villain is one of the things that's helped to shape a lot of things that came afterward. Like a lot of other villains of the disco era, Servalan is over-the-top and frequently campy, with giant shoulderpads and huge hats. But Pearce also let you glimpse real madness behind the scenery-chewing, and a real vulnerability — especially in "Rumors of Death," when she's chained to a "very old wall." Plus Blake's 7 managed to go a lot further with the sexual tension between Servalan and Avon than most other shows of the era — helping to inspire tons of other villains who have overt sexual chemistry with the "good guy."

4. Patrick Stewart (Star Trek: The Next Generation)
Star Trek: The Next Generation felt like a major step forward for television science fiction, once it got past two clunky seasons. This was a show that was willing to delve deeper than the original Trek into questions about what made us human, and the nature of reality. And Patrick Stewart was the anchor for this more thoughtful take on television space opera. He brought gravitas and thoughtfulness to the role of "starship captain," and showed that television acting could be subtle and intense. The era of "serious" actors taking roles in science fiction and fantasy shows probably started with Stewart.

5. Lucy Lawless (Xena, Warrior Princess)
She started out on Kevin Sorbo's Hercules show, and then got her own spin-off as a reformed villain going around the ancient world helping people and being all heroic. Lawless helped made the television world safe for female action heroes — but she also helped to redefine the "action hero" role as something involving a lot more heart and interior life than just the standard swaggerpants archetype. Here's a pretty great article by an acting coach about all the warmth and subtle technique that Lawless brought to the role of Xena, taking a seriously campy show and infusing it with a modicum of humanity. And vulnerability.

6. Alyson Hannigan (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)
Willow starts out as the nerdy best friend, who's a well-established "type" of character to this day. She later morphs into the helpful witch sidekick, who's also a sort of character that persists on television, and then also becomes one of the first openly gay characters in genre TV. But through all of these transformations, Willow feels like a fully-realized character, with quirks that aren't just about being "quirky." Willow gets to turn evil and fall in love multiple times, and Hannigan finds ways to keep her grounded in her original dorky-sweater incarnation even after she's grown into a larger-than-life character, capable of destroying the whole world if she goes dark. The sweetness and humor Hannigan brings to Willow can be seen in every off-beat fantasy character who comes after, and as television has gotten more fantasy-oriented, Willow's legacy is everywhere.

7. Nathan Fillion (Firefly)
I almost left Fillion off the list, figuring that one Whedon star is enough — but Meredith convinced me that Fillion deserves his spot, for bringing a morally gray and tortured hero, who's never anything less than sympathetic, to television. In just a half season of television, Fillion had more unforgettable moments of wise-cracking and "vulnerable tough guy" greatness than most stars get in seven or eight seasons. If Lucy Lawless added vulnerability to the TV action hero, Fillion took that and added unpredictability and extra snark. Fillion never lets us forget that Captain Tightpants is scarred by being on the losing side of the big war, even without having to say anything out loud. And he never lets us forget that Mal Has A Code. I don't know how many other actors on genre television explicitly borrow from Fillion's turn in Firefly, but for fans of the genre he's one of the most emblematic, up there with Shatner and Tom Baker.

8. Mary McDonnell (Battlestar Galactica)
Honestly, it's hard to pick the most "defining" performance from BSG — strong contenders are also Edward James Olmos as William Adama, Michael Hogan as Saul Tigh, and Katee Sackhoff as Starbuck. But when I think of the most ground-breaking performance, McDonnell jumps out immediately. It would have been a big enough deal if McDonnell had given us a strong female political leader, who radiates authority in the middle of an impossible situation — but she went much deeper than that, giving us a character who gets to do all sorts of stuff beyond being "tough". And still has her authority at the end of it all. President Laura Roslin is capable of some pretty questionable decisions, not to mention actual ethical lapses, and yet we never stop sympathizing with her and rooting for her. She even manages to have a romance with her erstwhile political opponent Adama without becoming just a love interest. And her "I am coming for all of you" speech is one of the few great highlights of the show's final episodes.

9. John Noble (Fringe)
We'd already seen plenty of mad scientists by the time Noble started playing Walter Bishop on Fringe — but Noble gave us the most fascinating version of madness we'd seen up to that point. Walter is capable of insane freak-outs, extreme childishness, massive inappropriateness, and utter charm, all without feeling like an inconsistent character. A lot of actors would have probably gone more over the top with a role like Walter, or given us a more consistently "lovable" version of the character, who only occasionally hints at darkness. But John Noble has been willing to go more over the edge into actual craziness, anger and self-loathing. And that's before the show asked him to create a number of other versions of Walter, including an upright, powerful version from another reality, and two past versions. There's a reason why everybody thinks John Noble has been robbed of his rightful Emmy.

10. Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones)
And finally, an actor who did actually win an Emmy. Tyrion Lannister was already a fan favorite character from the books — but he's a hard character to bring to the screen, with his whoring and his ruthlessness and his close relationship with his incestuous, child-tossing brother. I often think about the scene in one of the early episodes where Tyrion strides into the banquet room and keeps ordering food items, including extra crispy bacon and fish, while he's coping with the fact that the Stark boy has been injured and may die — and it's probably his brother's fault. There's just something so incredible about Peter Dinklage ordering breakfast, it's more interesting than most other actors delivering a huge emotional speech. But then there's also the "turtle stew" scene later in the season, and some marvelous stuff in season two. More than any other character, I'm dying to see how Tyrion copes with what's to come in season three.

War is war and every one is different. The objective is conquest. How the war is waged is a reflection of the time and this is how war is waged in 21st century.

‘Brutality-offenses' are up +83.5% with a +92.4% for severe and dangerous bodily harm, with theft rising with 11.6% and forgeries by 22.3%.
Germany: Afghan migrants assault people and vandalise subway. Police say it happens weekly By Vincent van den Born, The Old Continent, May 7, 2017: “Imagine this,” the article in BZ Berlin challenges you, “someone who is a guest in your house insults your family. He attacks your wife. You'd throw him out, no doubt about it. Because that is your right.” The implied question: why doesn't the same happen with asylum seekers who rampage through the streets of Berlin? One typical example. Tuesday night, almost 23:00 on the Berlin Underground, line 7. While on the train, five men rampage, kicking the benches and doors, accosting the other travellers. “They were very aggressive” one of the witnesses later declared. When the men leave the carriage at their stop, the emergency number is called. Policemen of Division 25 respond immediately. Another witness observes the group, still “loud and aggressive,” leaving the Underground station. One of them then jumps on the road and “with full force” kicks a woman riding her bike. The woman falls to the ground, suffering bruises and grazing wounds. The perpetrators could later be arrested at a refugee home. All of them are from Afghanistan, between 19 and 22 years old, and have requested asylum in Germany. All of them are well known to the police, mostly for so-called ‘brutality-offenses' such as robbery, personal injury cases and abuse. Yet, on this night, as on the other nights, they were all let go. Nobody was arrested. According to the police, this is now a weekly occurrence in Berlin: “We confront them every week, and every week we have to let them go, that's frustrating.“ No wonder then, that there is a dramatic increase in ‘brutality-offenses' (+83.5%), with a +92.4% for severe and dangerous bodily harm, with theft rising with 11.6% and forgeries by 22.3%. Out of a total of 135.886 suspects, 9641 were ‘refugees' or asylum seekers, up 2834 from 2015. Their excuse? As Mozafar Y., one of the five Underground hoodlums, says “we'd been drinking.” Meanwhile, the politicians talk, saying the same things they've said before.

However, in the 5th inning, he misplaced a grounder in left field on a play where two runs scored, increasing the deficit to 6-0. The Tigers finally got some offense going in the bottom of the 9th inning. A Fields double, Ian Kinsler and JD Martinez singles, and a Tyler Collins three-run homer made it a 7-5 game, which was ultimately too little too late.
Rajai Davis was away from the team for the whole series, so Anthony Gose started all three games. Batting at the top of the order, he only had one hit and one run. His batting average has now fallen below .300 after a very hot start to the season.

Brad Ausmus made a couple of changes to the batting order, including moving Jose Iglesias up to second. Like Gose, the young shortstop did not have a great series, going just 2/12. The Tigers offensive issues were not helped by the struggles at the beginning of the lineup.

Why Do Blacks and Leftists Wish the Attack on Smollett Happened?
If you want to know where the Democratic Party is headed, think about this:
I've been writing about Hillary Clinton for almost 20 years—ever since the Monica Lewinsky scandal—and it will hardly come as a surprise to those of you who have read my books that my critical opinion of Hillary has made me a pariah among liberals—especially among the liberal mainstream media.
Before I started writing about Hillary, I wrote several books about the Kennedys, and in those days I was a welcome guest on the Today Show, Good Morning America, Charlie Rose, Larry King—practically everywhere on TV.
However, once I started portraying Hillary for what she is—an angry, self-righteous politician, who blames everybody but herself for her problems—I was no longer invited to sit with my old friends in front of a TV camera and discuss the news.
Well, folks, that may be about to change.
Two card-carrying members of the liberal mainstream media—Amie Parness and Jonathan Allen—who wrote a gushy book about Hillary a couple of years ago, have apparently seen the light.
They are coming out with a book today that tells it like it is. The book is called Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton's Doomed Campaign, and it portrays Hillary as—you guessed it!—an angry, self-righteous politician who blames everybody but herself for her problems.
And why do I think this is important?
For the simple reason that the same Amie Parness—on the day before publication of her new book—wrote a piece for The Hill, a political newspaper, in which she described Bernie Sanders—not Hillary Clinton— as the key to rebuilding the Democratic Party as it struggles to find its identity after the devastating defeat in 2016.
Mark this date: The liberal mainstream media is leaving Hillary and moving further and further to the left—away from Saint Hillary and into the arms of the socialist Bernie Sanders.
The Czech Republic's counterintelligence agency says the number of Russian spies remains high and the Kremlin is building a spy network in Europe similar to the Soviet network before World War II.
"It is assessed that Russia is creating a structure in Europe drawing on the concept of the Comintern founded by the Soviet Union," the Czech Security Information Service said in an annual report released on September 4.
The Comintern, or Communist International -- the association of local communist parties -- was established by Soviet Russia in 1919 to protect the new regime in Moscow from outside attacks.
The report said the Kremlin is also trying to take control over Russian community organizations in the Czech Republic.
The agency said Russian spies remain particularly interested in the Czech energy sector, particularly any possible enlargement of nuclear power plants.
"Russia does not consider a fight over the Czech nuclear energy sector a lost battle," the report said.

RALEIGH, N.C. -- The frosty relationship between North Carolina State athletic director Debbie Yow and Maryland's Gary Williams took a nasty turn during the introduction of the Wolfpack's new men's basketball coach.
Yow -- who spent 16 years as Maryland's athletic director -- called out the Terrapins coach, who won the 2002 NCAA championship working under her, of interfering with the search.
It happened during North Carolina State's news conference introducing Mark Gottfried, who replaced Sidney Lowe. Yow responded to a reporter's question to Gottfried about whether she had a reputation of being difficult to work with.
"I don't have a reputation across all men's basketball of being difficult to work with," she said Tuesday. "I have a reputation of not getting along with Gary Williams, who has tried to sabotage the search. Come on, we all know that. OK, so whatever.
"It's not a reputation. It's Gary Williams out there doing his thing. Whatever."
When asked if she had specific examples of anything Williams had said or done, Yow replied: "There'll be somebody else writing about that nationally. I don't need to be doing that. That's not my job."
Doug Dull, a team spokesman at Maryland, did not immediately return a call or email from The Associated Press for comment. But Williams did release a statement to the Baltimore Sun saying he hasn't talked to anyone, coach or athletic director, connected to the N.C. State search.
"I don't have any interest in the N.C. State search, since I'm coaching at Maryland and working hard to run our program," Williams said. "Anyone who says I've had contact with a prospective coach or athletic director regarding this search isn't being truthful."
It became apparent several years ago that Yow and Williams were butting heads, even though neither acknowledged any animosity toward the other. But in July 2008, a D.C.-area AAU coach said, "This is from what I hear, not what I've seen, but people think they don't like each other."
The distrust and tension stems from Williams' recruiting at Maryland, specifically in 2008, when the Terrapins lost two high-profile recruits -- Gus Gilchrist, who ended up at South Florida, and Tyree Evans, who went to Kent State.
Williams told the media, when asked about the two: "It wasn't my fault that they're not here. That was somebody else's call."
But Maryland senior associate athletic director Kathleen Worthington countered that, telling the Baltimore Sun: "I want to clarify the facts and the timing and the decision process of these situations. It was my recommendation that we not sign a release for Gus. I didn't want to release him. It was the head coach's decision. No one else released Gus."

Google Pixel 2 and the Pixel XL 2 are all set to launch tomorrow but almost everything about these devices including their design and specifications were already leaked online. Evan Leaks, a popular and a reliable source for smartphone leaks, took to his Twitter account a few hours back to leak the final renders of both the Google Pixel 2 and the Pixel XL 2 devices.

According to the leaks, the new home screen layout on both these devices look a little different when compared to their predecessors. The image shows that Google has replaced the traditional position of the Google search widget from the top of the screen to the bottom ultimately replacing the dock area.
This change actually makes sense, considering the fact that both the devices are more than 5 inches long and it would be easier to access the search widget if it is placed at the bottom than at the top. So, here is a quick step-by-step tutorial on how to get the Google Pixel 2 like search widget on any Android device.
How To Get Pixel 2 Search Widget Dock On Any Android
Step 1:
In order for this to work, you have to first install Nova launcher on your device, if you are already using it, well and good. If not, you can download and install it from the Google Play Store.
Step 2:
Now open the Nova Launcher app and then remove all the app icons present on the app drawer by long pressing on them and then selecting remove.
Step 3:
Now drag and drop your favourite apps from the app drawer to your home screen, just above the dock.

Step 4:
Since you have removed the icon that takes you to the app drawer, you have to replace it with the swipe gesture just like the one in the Google Pixel.
To do that, long press on your home screen and then select settings. Now select the app and widget drawers and then enable the ‘Swipe to open' option.
Step 5:
Now if you want a setup exactly like the one in the Google Pixel 2 and the Pixel XL 2, you have to hide your app name labels.
You May Like: How To Use Face ID And Voice To Unlock Android Apps
To do that, again go to Settings and then select the Desktop option and then select icon layout. Now disable the label option here to remove the app name labels from your homescreen.
Note: This will remove the label for every app you place on your desktop. If you want to remove the labels from only the apps on the main screen, then you can manually edit and remove them.
Step 6:
This is the main part, long press on your home screen and then select the Nova Google Search bar widget under the widgets menu and hold it to place it on your home screen just where the dock icons where.
Step 7:
To customize the widget to look exactly like the one in the Google Pixel 2, just long press on the widget and then select Edit. You can also then resize the widget to fit your screen.
Step 8:
You can also remove the page indicator if you want by going to Settings->Desktop->Page Indicator and none.
Step 9:
Now for the final touch, you have to adjust the height and the width of both your home screen icons and the Google search widget so that they align perfectly just like the one in the leak.
You can do this by going to Settings->Desktop->Height Padding and then selecting medium from the menu. Also, adjust the dock padding by going to the dock settings and then selecting medium for width padding and none for height padding.
Lastly, enable the Dock as overlay option to ensure that the swipe gesture works perfectly.
Step 10:
That's it. You have successfully achieved the Pixel 2 look on your device. If you want, you can also download the official Pixel 2 wallpaper from here. It might take some time for you to get used to this new layout. Let us know your thoughts on the comments below.
Image caption Jade Parker stabbed her neighbour with a pink knife
A Midlothian mother who disembowelled a man with a pink knife because he broke her window has been jailed for 45 months.
Jade Parker, 23, from Dalkeith, had earlier admitted attempting to murder Anthony McMahon outside her home in Mayfield on 18 October 2010.
When they rowed over the broken window and she threatened to stab him he said: "Go on then."
She was told her remorse appeared genuine at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Mr McMahon had known Parker for years and she called him "Uncle Tony" the court heard.
Solicitor advocate Krista Johnston, defending, said: "He had known this young lady since she was seven or eight years old and did not think she had it in her, did not think she would do it."
The injury bled profusely and Mr McMahon's intestines spilled out of the wound Laura Thomson, Advocate depute
However, the lawyer said, a combination of drink and a wish to show off in front of two men, one her boyfriend, led Parker to lash out.
Advocate depute Laura Thomson said: "She stabbed Mr McMahon in the stomach using a pink knife.
"The injury bled profusely and Mr McMahon's intestines spilled out of the wound."
Minutes later, Parker was trying to help her 40-year-old victim and was calling 999 the court heard.
Sentencing her on Wednesday, judge Lord Brailsford told the mother-of-two that her remorse appeared genuine and she had no serious previous convictions.
The judge continued: "However I have to have regard to the gravity of the offence and the fact that you used, for whatever reason, no doubt drugs and alcohol played a part, but you chose to use a knife."
The court heard that she and her boyfriend did not want the company of "alcoholic" Mr McMahon and sent him away, claiming that Parker wanted to go to bed.
He was "angry" when he later caught sight of her returning home after buying more alcohol.
Mr McMahon wrapped a cup in a bag and broke a window at Parker's home.
After the stabbing, paramedics had to hold Mr McMahon together as he was taken to hospital, where he spent 48 hours in intensive care.
Doctors said his life was in danger.
Police questioned Parker who said she was "raging" after the window was broken.
They found the pink kitchen knife with a seven inch blade in Parker's fridge and noted "a strong perfumed smell."
The court heard that for years Parker had struggled with drink, drugs and post-natal depression.
(NaturalNews) If you read the ingredients label on a loaf of bread, you will usually find an ingredient listed there as. This is a non-essential amino acid added to many baked goods as a dough conditioner in order to speed industrial processing. It's usually not added directly to flour intended for home use, but you'll find it throughout commercial breads such as pizza dough, bread rolls and pastries.While some L-cysteine is directly synthesized in laboratories, most of it is extracted from a cheap and abundant natural protein source:. The hair is dissolved in acid and L-cysteine is isolated through a chemical process, then packaged and shipped off to commercial bread producers. Besides human hair, other sources of L-cysteine include chicken feathers, duck feathers, cow horns and petroleum byproducts.Most of the hair used to make L-cysteine is gathered from the floors of barbershops and hair salons in China, by the way.While the thought of eating dissolved hair might make some people uneasy, most Western consumers ultimately have no principled objections doing so. For Jews and Muslims, however, hair-derived L-cysteine poses significant problems., and many rabbis forbid hair consumption for similar reasons. Even rabbis who permit the consumption of hair would forbid it if it came from corpses -- and since much L-cysteine comes from China, where sourcing and manufacturing practices are notoriously questionable, this is a real concern. In one case, a rabbi forbade the consumption of L-cysteine because the hair had been harvested during a ritual at a temple in India., authored by Mike Adams and David Guiterrez.

India has begun phasing out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, was an international agreement to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of substances responsible for ozone depletion. These included chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs).
CFCs and HCFCs had been used in a wide range of industrial applications – such as aerospace, agriculture, air conditioning, electronics, fire protection, flexible and rigid foam, laboratory measurements and refrigeration. Produced mostly in developed countries, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) began to replace CFCs and HCFCs. HFCs posed no harm to the ozone layer because, unlike CFCs and HCFCs, they did not contain chlorine. They were, however, greenhouse gases, with a very high global warming potential (GWP), thousands of times greater than carbon dioxide (CO2) when measured on a per-molecule basis. While their atmospheric concentration was initially very low, it began to grow rapidly in the years following the Montreal Protocol.
Credit: UNEP
Known as "super greenhouse gases," it was feared that soaring use of HFCs, combined with their high global warming potential, could undercut the benefits expected from the reduction of other greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. If left unchecked, it was calculated that HFCs could add a potentially disastrous 0.5°C to global average temperatures by the end of the 21st century.*
Unlike other greenhouse gases in the 2015 Paris Agreement, HFCs had other international negotiations. In September 2016, the New York Declaration urged a global reduction in the use of HFCs. In October 2016, negotiators from 170 nations meeting at the summit of the UN Environment Programme in Kigali, Rwanda, reached a legally-binding accord to phase out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in an amendment to the original Montreal Protocol.*
While hailed as a major achievement for international diplomacy, there were significant differences on the timing and schedule of reductions. The final agreement would see the richest countries starting the process in 2019. Over 100 developing nations would follow in 2024. However, a small group of countries argued for and secured a later start, insisting their economies needed time to grow. Among this group was India, the world's third largest emitter of greenhouse gases and a region with surging demand for air conditioning, due to both rising incomes and increasingly extreme hot weather.
The chemicals needed to replace HFCs were more flammable and toxic – requiring better-trained and better-paid people to design, install and maintain equipment such as air conditioners safely and correctly. In addition, new technologies were required to capture and store HFC in some applications. India's Council on Energy, Environment and Water estimated that the total cost of phasing out HFCs in all homes, workplaces and vehicles could reach up to $38 billion.
India, along with Pakistan and a number of Gulf states, agreed to "freeze" their use of HFCs by 2028. This plateau would be followed by steep reductions from 2031 onwards,* leading to the vast majority of HFCs being eliminated by the late 2040s.*
Much of Bangkok is being abandoned due to flooding
Bangkok, with a population of over 12 million, has been sinking underwater for decades. By the early 2030s, it is facing a disaster of epic scale, with much of the city being abandoned.*
This has occurred for various different reasons. First and foremost, the city is built on clay. When originally settled, the region was just swampy coastline, but today it is covered by skyscrapers, highways and urban development. The enormous weight of all this concrete and steel has been pushing down on the soft clay beneath, causing the soils to descend by up to 5.3cm per year. By 2010, part of the megalopolis was already under sea level, a trend that would only become worse in the following decades.
The illegal tapping of groundwater has been another major factor. Many of the city's residents have been continuously pumping up groundwater – both for their own use and to sell as a commodity – removing a natural layer and resulting in further destabilisation of the soil.
Rising sea levels due to global warming have been yet another factor, eroding the coastline at a rate of 4cm a year, while the increasing severity of monsoon rains has led to longer and more devastating floods.
The explosive growth of Bangkok in recent decades (making it one of the fastest growing places in southeast Asia) has dealt a serious blow to the city's infrastructure. Areas of land that had in the early 20th century been used to absorb flood waters had vast suburbs and business districts built over them. Canals were filled in to make way for the rapid urbanisation of the Chao Praya River Delta. The weight of the city grew and grew, to the point where the soft soil it was built upon could simply no longer support it.
By the early 2030s, large portions of the megalopolis are well below sea level. The government's response during this time has proven inadequate, a lack of clear policy doing little to help the overall situation,* while sea walls have been almost useless due to increasing erosion of the shore. The lowering of the city, combined with rising sea levels (over 20cm higher than in 2000), has resulted in whole districts of Bangkok being permanently abandoned. Over a million buildings, the majority residential, are rendered uninhabitable, forcing their occupants to move further inland.
Many areas which have yet to be fully claimed by the sea have also been evacuated, as the regularity of flooding proved too costly for many. Shantytowns and refugee camps are forming outside the city, while the government struggles to adjust as the capital sinks. Thailand as a whole is going through a period of almost unimaginable stress at this time, a result of such huge population displacement. The political, economic and social upheaval in the region is having a significant impact on global GDP.
Efforts are underway to save Bangkok's numerous historical monuments and artifacts, with some temples being moved inland and reconstructed in their entirety. Due to the scale of this disaster, however, much is lost.
In the coming years, the situation for Bangkok will only worsen as more and more of the city is permanently flooded. By the end of this century, the entire city will be abandoned.*
Global reserves of lead are running out
Lead is a carbon group element with high density, malleability, softness and ductility. Metallic lead is relatively rare in the Earth's crust, and so is usually processed from zinc, silver and copper ores. Like silver, lead has been in use by humans for thousands of years. It was widely exploited by the Roman empire and played a large role in the industrial revolution. World production doubled from 1850 to 1900, doubled again from 1900 to 1950, then doubled yet again from 1950 to 2000.*
Due to its high density, it has often been used as a weight or ballast, as well as radiation shielding. It is also used in firearms and other weaponry. The bulk of lead is used in producing car batteries and similar, as well as in electrodes and high voltage wires. The primary producers are China, Australia, the United States, Canada and Kazakhstan.
Lead is also a pollutant and can be hazardous to human health, being infamous for its older uses in paint and fuels. From the 18th to 21st centuries, environmental levels of lead increased more than 1,000-fold.* In terms of numbers of people exposed and the public health impact, it became one of the largest environmental medicine problems. Although regulations from the 1970s began to reduce the lead content in products and greatly cut exposure in the developed world, many developing countries still allowed its use.
By the early 2030s, most reserves of lead are beginning to be exhausted.** Much of the recent increase in demand has come from China's growing automobile sector. Because about half of the supply comes from recycled scrap, improved recycling programs are able to carry demand in the short term. Fortunately, lead has ready alternatives for most of its uses including zinc, copper, iron and tungsten. However, some of these metals will soon be facing their own shortages too, necessitating the production of artificial replacements. Because of this, the 2030s sees an acceleration of global recycling efforts in order to avert a resource crunch.
Perennial wheat and corn are becoming profitable
In traditional agriculture, all major grain crops have been "annuals", or short-lived perennials grown as annuals – surviving for just one growing season. They die off once harvested, and then a brand-new crop must be planted to take their place. This requires vast amounts of fuel, fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides – causing soil erosion, acidification and disrupting both the nitrogen and carbon cycles.
Between 1600 and 2000 AD, the United States lost around one-third of its topsoil. Worldwide, soil erosion was putting the livelihoods of nearly a billion people at risk by the early 21st century.* More than a quarter of Earth's land surface had been converted for agricultural use, with more land converted since 1950 than in the previous 150 years. This situation was being exacerbated by rapid population growth,* demand for meat products in emerging economies, increased production of biofuels,* along with climate change and peak phosphorus* looming on the horizon.
Genetic engineering had emerged as an important tool in crop management. Among the more notable advances occurred in 2017, when BioCassava Plus received regulatory approval, giving a huge boost to farming in Africa.* By the early 2030s,** this has been followed by an even greater breakthrough – perennial wheat and corn – becoming profitable after many years of development.
Perennial grain crops provide a revolution in agriculture. By growing continuously for two or more years, they are far more efficient than traditional annual crops, requiring less fuel, fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides. They can store more carbon, maintain better soil quality and water content, and manage nutrients better, thanks to their deeper root systems.
The deciphering of bread wheat's genetic code in the early 2010s* helped in paving the way towards a new generation of perennial crops. The rate of increase in wheat yields, having been in decline since 1980, is now beginning to increase again. However, agriculture will face a new set of challenges later this decade as the effects of climate change begin to accelerate markedly.*
Web 4.0 is transforming the Internet landscape
Further convergence of the online and physical worlds has led to the emergence of "Web 4.0" – the next generation of internet. Semantic analysing programs, having evolved into stronger AI, now perform a huge range of automated tasks for business, government and consumers. Running on massively parallel networks, these applications hunt for textual and visual data – combining the most subtle capabilities of humans (such as pattern recognition) with ways in which machines are already vastly superior (such as speed and memory).*
In addition to serving as highly advanced search engines, they are playing a major function in the real world – gathering information from the array of sensors, cameras and other tracking devices now present in the environment, on vehicles, and even on people themselves.
Although privacy and civil liberties issues are being raised, this new generation of IT promises to bring enormous benefits to society. Crimes are faster and easier to solve thanks to these intelligent virtual agents; transport and logistics are smoother and more efficient; resources can be managed and distributed more accurately.
In addition, practically every physical document in existence has now been digitally encoded, backed up and archived online. This includes full copies of all books, journals, manuscripts and other literature ever published – forming a complete repository of human knowledge going back thousands of years. These documents can be retrieved and analysed using real-time speech commands, translated from any of the world's 6,000 languages and accessed via 3D holographic imaging.
Web 4.0 is also democratising the Internet more than ever before. News agencies are finding themselves increasingly outmoded by bloggers and other social media when it comes to speed and accuracy of information.
Stem cell pharmacies are commonplace
Stem cell pharmacies are now a fairly common experience in the developed world, offering walk-in diagnosis, stem-cell collection and banking services for use in future medical crises. Affordable, personalised and targeted treatments are becoming available for regenerating various body parts and organs.*

Married couples are a minority in the UK
By now, marriage in the UK has been reduced to a lifestyle choice enjoyed by a minority, rather than an essential institution of society. The married population has shrunk from almost 50% of adults in 2009, to just 41% now.* This trend began in the 1980s. Increasing pressures of work and money, together with the general stresses of the outside world (geopolitical, social and economic), are putting ever-greater strain on couples. The decline of religious institutions has also played a part. Unmarried partnerships no longer carry the stigma they once had.
In addition, increasing numbers of people either working at home alone, or living with their parents, are making it difficult for some to meet potential partners. Another contributory factor is an explosion in the use of virtual reality and other technologies leading to increased isolation of the individual. People of all ages spend increasingly large amounts of their time engaged in highly immersive online experiences, requiring little or no interaction with the outside world.
Of those who are married, the number of children per couple has declined – and not just in the UK, but other Western societies too. Combined with increasing numbers of Muslim immigrants (who have higher numbers of children), this is significantly altering the demographic balance.
Chocolate has become a rare luxury
By now, chocolate has become as rare and expensive as caviar, with even a single bar costing $10-15.
Drought, soil depletion and diminishing harvests in Africa – where two-thirds of the world's cocoa is produced – have led to soaring prices. Cocoa is also competing for agricultural space with other commodities like palm oil, which is increasingly in demand for biofuels.
Poor pay and working conditions have also been a factor. Many young farmers are now abandoning their lands and heading to the cities, in search of better and more highly-paid jobs.*
Mountain View High School: Reverse Frank Navarro's Administrative Leave Now https://t.co/YoepTAyUyG — Indybay (@Indybay) November 13, 2016
A high school teacher and a Holocaust scholar was placed on paid leave after drawing parallels between President-elect Donald Trump and Adolf Hitler in his class.
Frank Navarro, who teaches at Mountain View High School in California's Silicon Valley, said he cited some of Trump's controversial and racially charged statements, such as calling Mexican immigrants “rapists” and criminals and making comments about the Mexican heritage of a judge presiding over a lawsuit against Trump University, to make the case that there are some parallels with Hitler's persecution of Jews and the Nazi leader's rise to power.
Both had promised to make their countries “great again,” Navarro said.
He also cited Trump's previous statements about weakening libels laws to draw comparisons with how the Nazis established control and influence over the independent press.
“It's an effective way of embedding the lessons that I'm teaching regarding the place of government and the lives of people,” Navarro, who teaches special education, civics and world studies, told The Washington Post. “It's important to relate history to your lives because, in the end, that's what it's going to be about.”
Navarro was placed on paid leave on Thursday after a parent sent an email to school officials complaining about his teaching methods.

Principal Dave Grissom wrote in a letter to parents on Friday that he has an obligation to maintain an “emotionally safe environment” for students while protecting teachers and staff against unsubstantiated allegations, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.
“Regardless of their political affiliation, many of our students show signs of emotional stress,” Grissom said in the letter, the Chronicle reported.
District Superintendent Jeff Harding told the San Jose Mercury News that Navarro could return as early as Monday.
“We are interested in getting Frank back in the classroom . . . We're just trying to maintain our due diligence,” Harding told the Mercury News. “We have a heightened emotional environment right now with the election. It's always a challenge to maintain a line in a classroom.”
Navarro, a Mexican American whose father moved to the United States from Guadalajara, has been teaching at Mountain View High School for 40 years. He taught European history and classes focusing on the Holocaust. He became a Mandel fellow for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in 1997 and studied at the International Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism in Jerusalem, according to the Mercury News.
When confronted about his teaching methods, Navarro said he told the principal that everything he said in class was based on facts.

He said that going by how the complaint was described to him, the parent said Navarro told his students that Trump is Hitler.
“I never said that. That would be historical sloppy thinking,” Navarro said. “What I've been teaching is there are remarkable parallels between Hitler and Donald Trump.”
Shortly after he was placed on paid leave, a supporter started an online petition urging school officials to reverse their decision and to “publicly apologize for attempting to intimidate a respected educator.”
The petition had garnered 10,807 signatures as of Sunday afternoon.
Trump's candidacy has energized white supremacy groups and the alt-right movement, which rejects establishment conservatism and spreads its far-right ideology online.
Anti-Semitic posts also surged on social media during the presidential campaign. According to an October report by the Anti-Defamation League, at least 800 Jewish journalists received anti-Semitic tweets, many from Trump supporters.
A rash of pro-Trump vandalism and Nazi graffiti have been reported in the past few days since the real estate mogul won the election in a stunning upset against Hillary Clinton.
In Philadelphia, for instance, a pair of swastikas were spray-painted on storefront windows, according to an NBC affiliate.
Two similar incidents were reported in New York. One involved a swastika sign and the word “Trump” scrawled on a wall inside a dorm at the State University of New York College at Geneseo. In another incident, the words “Make American White Again” and a swastika sign were spray-painted on a softball dugout in Wellsville.

Samantha von Sperling is an image consultant in New York, but lately her bread-and-butter Wall Street clients have asked her to help their daughters get ready for rush at schools like Harvard; the University of Wisconsin, Madison; and New York University, which has added three chapters since 2006 and more than doubled the number of sisters, to 570.
“It's the same kind of coaching I do on Wall Street,” Ms. von Sperling says.
Sororities are emerging in surprising force at campuses not usually associated with the Greek tradition. Students raised on Facebook and fears about post-college careers view sororities as the ultimate social network and an extension of the community service begun in high school. Nationwide, membership is up, growing a bit more than 15 percent from 2008 to 2011, to 285,543 undergraduates, according to the National Panhellenic Conference, which represents 26 old-line sororities.
Twenty-eight percent of female undergraduates at George Washington University last semester were Greek, about double that in 2006; at Lehigh University, in Bethlehem, Pa., the number reached a high of 50 percent; at the University of Rochester, 22 percent; at the University of Pennsylvania, 29 percent.
Though new chapters are being added and membership expanded, competition is palpable for hot sororities. “The most sought-after organizations aren't able to keep up with the demand,” says Matt Supple, director of Greek life at the University of Maryland, which recently added a new chapter.
Which sororities get the most first-choice rankings is a closely guarded secret.
“Sorority recruitment is like no other experience that you will ever have for the rest of your life,” says Sunday Tollefson, author of “Rush Right: Reveal Your Best You During Sorority Recruitment.” “It's like speed dating meets interviewing meets beauty pageant meets upscale academic summer camp, complete with a counselor.”

Rush often begins in August or early fall — for January rush, substitute Uggs for fashionable flats. At the University of Mississippi, which has nine sororities, all candidates attend a first-round “philanthropy” event at each chapter that includes learning about its charitable work. Candidates can visit up to six chapters on the second round, depending on how many invites them to return, and three on the final.
In the early rounds, they have only minutes to make a positive impression. The trick, says Ms. Tollefson, whose Web site, SureSister.com, aims to demystify rush, is to be memorable for 10 minutes after each event. That's when sororities typically decide who will be cut.

Appealing facial expressions, confident body language and good conversational skills are critical. “Practice, practice, practice in the mirror, saying your name, and see what you look like when you listen,” advises Denise Pietzsch, an etiquette consultant in Ohio who works discreetly with clients heading to Miami University. “If you're a great active listener, they will remember you because you let them talk.” Her typical fee: $125 an hour.
Ms. von Sperling offers a Friday-to-Sunday intensive, for $8,000. One day is devoted to carrying yourself properly and the art of conversation. Treat rush, she says, as you would a job interview. Avoid politics and religion. “I teach them how to make interesting small talk: what you saw at the cinema, a trip to Europe. I don't know too many 20-year-olds who are having a debate about economics.” Another day is for getting physically ready — hair, makeup and wardrobe. Ms. von Sperling organizes “outfits down to accessories, completely strategized.” Just in case a client forgets, outfits are photographed and placed in a style file.
When Rachel Lewis was president of Alpha Chi Omega at the University of Kansas, parents asked: “Should I buy all J. Crew clothing? Do they need designer purses?” Ms. Lewis, a 2010 graduate, recently wrote “Recruitment 101: an Insider's Guide to Sorority Recruitment” and started up Sorority Corner, a membership-based Web site. Her advice: “Dress like you are meeting your boyfriend's parents. If it's too short or too tight or too out there, it won't impress.”
Sundresses by Lilly Pulitzer, the designer of happily hued clothing, are particulary popular for August rush. Two years ago, the company introduced the “Sorority Line” — totes, scarves, makeup bags and the like — using chapters' colors and symbols. Sales are strongest in the South: “OBSESSED! E-mailing this to the entire Gamma Psi chapter at Wofford College!” gushed one fan on the company Facebook page.
The Rushbiddies host a fashion workshop at Saks Fifth Avenue in Birmingham; they also give individual consultations. In late May, they visited a client's home in an affluent Birmingham cul-de-sac for a final session. They reviewed paperwork, dispensed advice and vetted dresses for August rush at Auburn. “This I love,” exclaimed Ms. Grant of a one-shoulder black cocktail dress destined for the last rush event. “It's not too over the top.” And shoes? “Black strappy sandals,” said Ms. Foster.
During the session, the rushee, Mallie, who did not want her full name published because it might affect her chances, was mostly quiet, worn out by her recent finals. Her mother took notes and asked questions. Later, Mallie talked about rush: “It's going to be stressful — not only making a decision for the next four years but for friends you will have for the rest of your life.” Because the experience can be so emotional, consultants provide “on-call services.”
Many aspiring sisters spend their summer working out and dieting. “Rushing shakes your confidence level,” says Maggie, who also spoke on condition she not is fully identified. She will soon be heading to Washington & Lee, and is trying to lose weight. “You are being judged on how you look,” she says. Case in point: A study of Northwestern undergraduates in a normal weight range, published in 2010, showed the thinner women more likely to join a sorority.
As rush grinds on, students often text their moms with frequent, sometimes tearful updates. “Drama Trauma Drama,” wrote one weary mother on a Greek chat forum. For some mothers, empathizing with the pain of peer rejection is excruciating.

“I lost six pounds that week,” recalls Julie Baselice, whose daughter Christina is now a Chi Omega at the University of Texas. “It was the most stressful experience of my life.” As for Christina, she is grateful for the counsel of Marjorie Burciaga, an Austin, Tex., consultant, on how to handle herself during recruitment events. “It's so easy to go in there and start talking, talking, talking,” she says. “You need to learn how to have a filter.”

Many students who don't get asked back by their dream sorority during the early rounds walk away from recruitment altogether. Last year at the University of Virginia, 27 percent left during January rush. Students often have their hearts set on a particular house, says Michael J. Citro, the assistant dean of students.
Or a rushee might limit herself to the house her mother belonged to (legacy status is a plus but no guarantee of a bid). Ms. Burciaga encourages her clients to keep an open mind about chapters they visit. “I talk to them about what seems like a good fit for them,” she says.
One obvious reason for rejection is inadequate grades. At the national level, sororities set a grade-point average, and individual sororities often raise the bar. Beyond that, candidates can rarely discern why a sorority rejects them.
Madeline D'Arcambal Braun, a Manhattan native entering her junior year at Indiana University Bloomington, says she had “absolutely no idea” why she wasn't asked back. She dropped out of rush freshman year after the houses she wanted didn't invite her back. “It's exactly like a breakup. That's how this feels.”
Indiana is reputed to have one of the toughest rushes. Parents have complained on the Sorority Parents blog, operated by the National Panhellenic Conference, that space is too limited. Last year, a little more than half of the 1,718 women at Indiana who registered for recruitment joined a sorority; about 800 either didn't continue or did not receive a bid. Possible reasons, say university officials: inadequate grades, student dissatisfaction with the chapters that chose them and vice versa, or not enough spaces.
This past year, the nonresidential sorority Theta Phi Alpha was added to expand slots, becoming the 20th chapter at Indiana. Ms. Braun decided to give this one a whirl, and joined sophomore year. “It's awesome,” she says. “I'm always raving about it.” Another nonresidential chapter, Alpha Sigma Alpha, is coming this fall.
Rush at George Washington University is a different ballgame. No résumés are needed. Nor are alumnae letters of recommendation or references. Requiring them “is ludicrous,” says Sara Fischer, who as president of the G.W. Panhellenic Association last year helped bring an 11th sorority to campus. “G.W. is not this kind of place.”

There aren't a lot of legacies at G.W.; students are not drawn there for its Greek life. “Most come to school with a bad idea of sororities, like hazing,” said Marta Cofone, current Panhellenic president, struggling to be heard over the throb of Katy Perry at a meet-the-Greeks event during new-student orientation last month. Last year, a G.W. sorority lost its housing after an alcohol-fueled hazing incident.
“I wasn't even going to join,” Ms. Cofone said, but the group leader she met at orientation was a “smart, intelligent and interesting person,” and Greek.
Several sorority members from New York and New Jersey, clustered at the Sigma Delta Tau table that night, recalled their mothers' collective shock at their decision to go Greek. But, says Ms. Fischer, “being in a sorority is the best way to network.” She credits her Greek contacts with helping her secure an apartment, jobs and internships. She and others also attribute the recent growth of their sorority to recruiting a broad swath of women. “You'll see that same set of Greek letters on someone with a nose piercing,” Ms. Cofone said, referring to the chapters' names emblazoned on members' T-shirts and caps. “That's why it's so successful.”
Valerie Berg, vice president of recruitment at G.W., notes that if students are open to any sorority who wants them, nearly all will get a bid. No prepping required.
Still, the elements of competition persist. Anticipating questions about October's rush, Ms. Berg recently updated the sororities' Facebook page. The topic: what to expect and what to wear on each day.
The vast majority of Americans gaining health coverage under Obamacare actually qualified for Medicaid because of loosened eligibility —and that's what boosted enrollment among those previously uninsured, according to a new report from The Heritage Foundation.
The Obama administration has boasted that the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, would allow those previously uninsured to purchase quality, affordable health care.
“The inescapable conclusion is that, when it comes to covering the uninsured, Obamacare so far is an expansion of Medicaid,” Heritage Foundation health policy experts Edmund F. Haislmaier and Drew Gonshorowski write in a research paper scheduled for release today.
Officials announced in May that more than 8 million Americans had picked a health plan on the Obamacare website, HealthCare.gov.
Haislmaier and Gonshorowski conclude that 8.5 million Americans gained coverage through Obamacare from January to July.
Commentary: The Real Story on How Much Obamacare Increased Coverage
However, their paper says, more than 70 percent of those signups can be traced to the expansion of Medicaid eligibility in 24 states:
Of the 8.5 million total individuals who gained health insurance coverage, 71 percent of that net coverage gain was attributable to Obamacare's expansion of Medicaid to able-bodied, working-age adults.
[Article continues after infographic.]
In the states that adopted and implemented Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, enrollment skyrocketed as an additional 5.7 million Americans signed up for coverage.
In 21 states opting out of Medicaid expansion, however, enrollment was strikingly lower. The Heritage report finds that 355,674 Americans signed up for Medicaid in those states.
In all, Medicaid enrollment increased by 6 million individuals for the first half of 2014.
The Daily Signal is the multimedia news organization of The Heritage Foundation.
The Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, loosened eligibility requirements for Medicaid, traditionally the government's health program for the poor. The changes made it easier for individuals with an income of up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line (roughly $16,000) to qualify for the taxpayer-funded health coverage.
>>> Report: Obamacare Will Add $131 Billion to Federal Deficits in Next Decade
As the Heritage experts note, many Medicaid-eligible Americans under the new requirements also don't have dependent children.
States got an incentive–federal dollars–to adopt the requirements.
Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia opted to expand Medicaid. By July, however, 24 states had implemented the program.
The Affordable Care Act went into effect in October. Its implementation included the rollout of HealthCare.gov, the online marketplace where consumers can peruse and purchase insurance plans.
HealthCare.gov's advent was accompanied by well-publicized malfunctions, glitches and failures. White House officials scrambled to fix the website as consumers experienced long delays. As a result, the Obama administration extended the close of open enrollment from March 30 until April 15.
>>> California Politician Claims Obamacare Contracts Went to Agency Director's Cronies
Despite the rocky rollout of HealthCare.gov, President Obama and then-Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius touted that enrollment in Obamacare insurance plans topped the original goal of 7 million.
According to reports from the Department of Health and Human Services, enrollment likely hovered around 7.3 million, as original estimates took into account those who selected a plan, but did not pay their first month's premiums.
Sylvia Mathews Burwell, who in June replaced Sebelius as HHS secretary, said in a speech last month at the Brookings Institute:
Four years after President Obama signed the law, middle class families have more security, and many who already had insurance have better coverage. Fewer Americans are uninsured, and at the same time, we're spending our health care dollars more wisely, and we're starting to receive higher quality care.

Rep. Matt Krause, R-Fort Worth, filed a proposal Wednesday that would require hospitals to keep brain-dead pregnant women on life support and appoint a legal representative for the woman's fetus in court proceedings.The bill was drafted following the case of Marlise Muñoz, a North Texas woman who collapsed when she was 14 weeks pregnant and showed no signs of brain activity. Her family asked that she be removed from life support, but John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth refused, citing state law.Her family watched her body deteriorate for two months before a state district judge ruled that the Texas Advance Directives Act, which states that “a person may not withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment” from a pregnant patient, did not apply because Muñoz was legally dead.Muñoz's mother, Lynne Machado, told The News earlier this month that the family does not support Krause's proposal and would testify against it.

The much expected south-west monsoon has arrived ahead of its scheduled arrival date and has begun its four-month stay over the Indian landmass.
The India Meteorological Department (IMD) under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) is tasked with keeping a track of the annual phenomenon and issue regular bulletins for the benefit of people. Since its inception in 1875, IMD has been striving to understand the phenomenon of monsoon and provide timely information on how the system would unravel.
In 1886, just 11 years after it was established, IMD came out with a monsoon forecast, thus making India the first country in the world to introduce such a system of season-wise forecast. The model adopted for the forecast has been revised time and again as scientists keep acquiring new knowledge on the science of monsoon.
Scientists have predicted that the monsoon this year would be normal, with a rainfall of 96 per cent of the long period of average.
However, monsoon forecast is not the only forte of IMD. It has also been providing other short and medium range forecasts.
Farmers particularly require weather forecast at the level of administrative block, which is one level higher than panchayat and one below the district. Presently, district level advisories are being issued. About 100 blocks would be covered by the end of this year and the rest will be covered by 2019.
In addition, the Department has been focusing on improving its capabilities for predicting severe weather events such as heavy rainfalls, severe convective storms and heat waves.
Rajeevan Madhavan Nair, secretary of MoES and an internationally acclaimed meteorologist says, “There is growing evidence that extreme weather events are increasing. The world has already witnessed more hot days and heat waves since the 1950s and the fifth IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report of 2014 warns that we will see more changes to weather extremes by the end of 21st century.”
Apart from seeking to impart a quantum jump in weather forecast, the ministry has embarked on a mega project to explore and exploit deep oceans for living and non-living resources. Noting that the oceans are full of mysteries and only five percent has been explored by humans so far, Rajeevan points out that oceans can be a good source for valuable minerals as well as for alternate energy sources. “Many geophysical activities, such as under the sea earthquakes that trigger tsunamis take place at the bottom of the sea. We are planning a lab at the bottom of the sea,” he added.
Research efforts would also be stepped up in polar research. India has permanent stations in Antarctica, the Arctic and one in the Himalayas. “Among the large number of questions identified, temporal changes in the extent of sea ice and their influence on atmospheric and ocean circulation is a prime area of knowledge gap,” Rajeevan said. “We need to understand and document these changes and examine their possible effects on Indian climate using observations and models. The ongoing scientific activities at Antarctic, Arctic and the Himalaya are, therefore, being further strengthened.”
Rajeevan has over 30 years of operational experience in different aspects of tropical meteorology. Before joining the Ministry, he was Director of Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune.
His main research contribution includes understanding monsoon variability, development of monsoon prediction models, understanding extreme weather events like heavy rainfall. Heat waves also cloud radiation interactions. He has received various awards for his outstanding work, noted among them is Young Scientist Award in 2007 for his research contributions in Atmospheric Sciences. (India Science Wire)

The insider trading fix and class justice in America
By Barry Grey
8 April 2015
Every day in America, workers and young people are set upon by the police. On most days, at least one is killed.
Over the seven days between March 27 and April 3, 28 people were killed by police officers across the US. Christopher Prevatt, 38, of Winchester, Virginia became the 28th fatality of the week, and the 298th of 2015, when he was shot and killed in his home at about 5 PM on April 3 by a Frederick County Sheriff's deputy.
The same week, 11 educators in Atlanta, Georgia, including four former teachers, were convicted on state racketeering charges for inflating the results on standardized tests. An investigation by the governor's office had concluded that the educators were threatened with the loss of their jobs or demotion if they failed to meet student achievement targets. Nevertheless, they were led away to prison in handcuffs to face sentences of 20 years or more. The judge denied their requests for bail, vindictively declaring that they had made their beds and now had to lie in them.
Also that week, a judge in Indiana sentenced a 33-year-old woman to a 20-year prison term for feticide. The woman, who had a miscarriage in 2013, was arrested after her doctor informed police that she might have used medication to terminate her pregnancy.
In America, “justice” for the working class and poor is remorseless, brutal and final. Millions are caught up in the vast gulag known as the prison system—the largest in the world. They are overwhelmingly poor and disproportionately black and Latino. According to the American Bar Association, 360 people are serving life sentences for shoplifting in California alone.
Occasionally, workers who have been imprisoned for years or decades on the basis of false evidence are released. Last November, Rickey Jackson, then 57, was exonerated of murder charges after spending more than 39 years in prison, several of them on death row. Such rare exceptions to the rule of permanent entombment for victims of police frame-ups provide a glimpse into the cesspool of injustice and cruelty for millions that is the American justice system.
It is entirely different for the rich and well connected, especially the denizens of Wall Street. On April 3, the last day of Christopher Prevatt's life, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit turned down a motion by the US Attorney for the district covering Wall Street to reconsider the court's December ruling overturning the conviction on insider trading charges of two hedge fund executives.
Legal experts were surprised that the appeals court refused to accept the prosecutor's motion, which included a request that the entire court review the ruling handed down in December by a three-judge panel. They were surprised because the December ruling sharply broke with judicial precedent to impose a novel and highly restrictive standard for prosecuting and convicting financial criminals who use insider information not available to the public to rig the markets for their personal gain.
The court brushed aside the prosecutor's argument that its ruling “will dramatically limit the government's ability to prosecute some of the most common culpable and market-threatening forms of insider trading.” The judges knew that, which is precisely why they ruled in the way they did.
The December ruling overturned the convictions of Anthony Chiasson, founder of Level Global Investors, and Todd Newman, a former trader at Diamondback Capital Management. Newman and Chiasson had received prison sentences of four-and-a-half and six-and-a-half years, respectively, after allegedly taking in $72 million by soliciting insider information about technology firms Nvidia and Dell.
In the wake of the December ruling, the Obama Justice Department has already dropped charges against several defendants it had accused of trading on insider information, including some who had pleaded guilty. The department said prosecutors could not prove allegations under the new legal framework.
It is believed that the ruling has set the stage for a reversal of the 2013 jury trial conviction of former SAC Capital Advisors portfolio manager Michael Steinberg. A longtime confidant of the multibillionaire manager of the SAC hedge fund, Steven A. Cohen, Steinberg was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison last May.
In 2013, the Justice Department arranged a settlement with SAC and Cohen under which the firm pleaded guilty and paid $1.2 billion in penalties for operating what prosecutors called insider trading “on a scale without known precedent.” No charges were brought against Cohen himself, who was allowed to keep the vast bulk of his $9 billion-plus fortune, obtained, according to the government, by criminal means.
These cases typify American class justice as applied to the financial aristocracy. The parasites who make their fortunes by speculating with other people's money, playing fast and loose with securities and fraud laws, are shielded from any criminal accountability by the Obama administration, Congress and the courts. The media does its part by covering up or downplaying their crimes.
The new aristocrats, like the lords of old, are not bound by the laws that apply to the lower orders. Voluminous reports have been issued by Congress and government panels documenting systematic fraud and lawbreaking carried out by the biggest banks both before and after the Wall Street crash of 2008.
Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and every other major US bank have been implicated in a web of scandals, including the sale of toxic mortgage securities on false pretenses, the rigging of international interest rates and global foreign exchange markets, the laundering of Mexican drug money, accounting fraud and lying to bank regulators, illegally foreclosing on the homes of delinquent borrowers, credit card fraud, illegal debt-collection practices, rigging of energy markets, and complicity in the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme.
One government-organized settlement has followed another, utilizing “deferred prosecution” deals and other gimmicks to allow Wall Street CEOs to get off scot-free. All the banks have had to do is pay largely fictitious fines, much of the nominal amount written off as tax credits.
Not a single top bank executive has been criminally prosecuted, let alone convicted or jailed, for illegal practices that led to the collapse of the financial system and a global depression. On the contrary, they have been rewarded by their bribed flunkies in government. They have seen their profits and personal fortunes soar on the basis of government bailouts and an endless stream of cash from the Federal Reserve.
Their plundering of the economy has continued unabated, while the working class has been made to pay the cost through layoffs, wage cuts and a ruthless assault on social programs and services.
The same week as the appeals court's refusal to reconsider its December ruling on insider trading, Barron's magazine emblazoned its March 30 edition with a photo of JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon (known as “Obama's favorite banker”) and the headline “Back on Top.” The caption read: “After five years of regulatory tumult, JPMorgan has emerged as the No. 1 US bank in assets, credit cards, and investment banking. But CEO Jamie Dimon is not finished yet. Why shares could rise 30 percent in a year.”
Describing the bank's annual investor day event, held in February, the article quoted a banking analyst as saying, “If there was a theme to investor day, it was Taylor Swift's song, ‘Shake it off.'”

The simulation of Michael Phelps racing a great white shark on Discovery Channel was another bizarre episode of humans racing animals. Here are 4 times humans actually competed against animals. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)
The prospect of seeing Michael Phelps race against a great white during “Shark Week” drew millions of viewers to Discovery Channel on Sunday night. It's safe to say that a large portion of that throng came away mightily disappointed that the Olympic superstar did not win swim alongside an actual shark but rather a digitally inserted predatory fish.
[Shark weak: Michael Phelps loses race to computer-generated great white]
On Tuesday, Phelps went on Facebook to defend the show and to take issue with the “haters” criticizing him for participating in what they saw as a deceptively advertised stunt. “Some people just decide not to listen to some of the things that we do, and that's not my fault that you don't do that,” Phelps said in a nearly hour-long Q&A with his Facebook audience.
“It's pretty easy to open up your ears and listen to either what the TV is saying, what the announcers are saying, or what I'm saying in interviews,” he added.
“You can believe whatever you want,” Phelps told another Facebook user. “Everything was either presented on air during multiple interviews that I did throughout Shark Week or the beginning of the show. Sorry you feel that way.
“For me, this was something I always wanted to do, and I was honored to be able to do it. So, I'm sorry that you feel that way. I feel very different.”
Phelps's point was that he had made it clear beforehand that he would not be in the water at the same time as the shark. A Vanity Fair article published two days before his special aired contained this passage:
To be clear, Phelps will not be swimming in a pool, with a shark in an adjacent lane. (As the swimmer put it, “I don't think that would probably end very well.”) Instead, the two will each swim 100 meters in the same open water, and their times will be compared.
Of course, not everyone read that story, or heard Phelps tell Jimmy Fallon much the same thing, before the much-hyped show. Some might have seen this Discovery promo, which does not make clear that Phelps would not, in fact, be competing head-to-head with a great white:
“All the promotion, interviews and the program itself made clear that the challenge wasn't a side-by-side race,” Discovery said in a statement.
“Everybody wants to pick on something or say something or complain about something, so … I had fun racing a shark, and seeing those animals up close and personal,” Phelps said, once back on dry land and in front of his computer Tuesday.
“If somebody actually wants to get in the water and race side-by-side with a great white, go ahead. You're not going to get the shark to swim in a straight line.
“And, yeah, it would be interesting to see,” he added with a chuckle. “We'll leave it at that.”
Phelps did offer an apology of sorts, saying, “For those of you who are disappointed, I'm sorry for that.” At other times in his Facebook session, though, he turned the criticism back on those who were calling him out.
“It's truly incredible watching some of the questions that these haters have out there,” Phelps said. “I mean, it's shocking. … There's always somebody out there that's going to take a jab, or say something negative about you.”

European judges have rejected a claim from a prominent republican that his detention under UK terror laws breached his human rights.
Colin Duffy was held for 12 days after he was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the murder of two soldiers in 2009.
He was one of three people to complain to the European Court of Human Rights that their detention under the UK's Terrorism Act was incompatible with rules governing lawful arrest and detention under the European Convention on Human Rights.
Their claims relied on an article covering the right to liberty and security, specifically the entitlement to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.
In a ruling today, judges at the Strasbourg court ruled that Duffy's application was inadmissible.
Mr Duffy, who was later acquitted of all charges, was joined in the legal action by Gabriel Magee and Teresa Magee, who were arrested in 2009 in connection with the killing of a police officer.
Mr Magee and Ms Magee were also held for 12 days before being released. No charges were brought against them.
Their complaint was brought under the same section of the Convention as Mr Duffy, as well as another part of the same article which covers the right to be informed of the reasons for arrest.
Both claims were rejected, with judges saying there had been no violation in their case.
Duffy, of Lurgan, Co Armagh, was acquitted in 2012 of all charges connected to the deaths of two soldiers at Massereene Army barracks in Antrim in 2009.
TRENTON — PSE&G isn't the only collector that's come calling for Mayor Tony Mack.
One day after the utility shut off power and gas at Mack's Berkeley Avenue house due to nonpayment, a review of public records reveals Mack owes more than $50,000 to the IRS and has two properties currently in foreclosure.
Told about the Mack's latest financial woes, friend and ally Councilman Alex Bethea winced.
“My friend ... I am speechless,” he said. “I don't have a comment on that. I am taken aback.”
Lenders filed a foreclosure notice on one property, the 302 West State Street building owned by Mack's company, Foremost Development and Construction LLC, on July 16, just two days before FBI agents searched Mack's home in an early morning raid.
Over the past two weeks, FBI agents have seized evidence from several properties and City Hall in a search for evidence of bribery, extortion, fraud, money laundering and drug dealing linked to the Mack administration and associates like Joseph “JoJo” Giorgianni, a campaign contributor.
Mack maintains he is cooperating with the investigation and has not “violated the public trust.”
The first-term mayor has long struggled under a heavy debt load, owing hundreds of thousands of dollars on mortgages and overdue city tax and sewer payments over the past several years. He's defaulted on mortgages several times, with a former property on Sweets Avenue foreclosed upon twice.
His Berkeley Avenue home, where he lives with his wife and four children, has faced foreclosure three times, most recently in August 2010. At the time, the $319,457 owed on the property far exceeded its estimated value.
In interviews, Mack has acknowledged his shaky finances, explaining the cycles of foreclosure and late taxes stemmed from years of sporadic employment.
“This is my third or fourth foreclosure over the last seven years, since I lost my job in 2004,” he said in 2010 after news of the latest foreclosure surfaced. “I've been struggling to keep the things that we own, things I worked hard for.”
The Times called Mack for comment several times yesterday, with no answer. The voicemail for his cell phone was full.
Most of Mack's past foreclosures and debts — including $34,800 in back taxes and fees for a fire-damaged property at 29 Hampton Avenue — piled up after Mack lost his $80,000 job as the city's recycling coordinator in 2004. A short stint as a business administrator for the Barrington school district in South Jersey ended in late 2008 with a contract buyout.

Elected in 2010, Mack now makes $126,400 annually as mayor.
But even with the regular paycheck, his financial troubles have continued to mount over the past several months.
The IRS filed a federal tax lien against Mack and wife Kara on May 31, alleging they owe $50,576 in federal income taxes dating back to 2009. Kara Mack cares for the couple's young children and does not work outside the home.
IRS spokeswoman Dianne Besunder said the agency cannot legally disclose personal tax information and could not comment on whether any of the back taxes have been repaid.
The IRS will publish a tax lien release if debts are paid or released by bond, but a search of county records showed no federal release certificate for Mack.
Mack is not the only local elected official to get into hot water with the IRS.
Court documents reveal Hamilton Mayor John Bencivengo, who's currently awaiting trial on charges of extortion and money laundering related to a $12,400 bribe he's alleged to have taken from an insurance broker, told the broker in a recorded conversation that the IRS sent him a letter stating he owed $5,200 in income taxes.
County records show no tax liens filed against Bencivengo.
On March 6, five months before the IRS filed its warning, Wells Fargo sent a foreclosure notice for the 245 Tioga Street property owned by Mack and his wife.

The Tioga Street property is currently assessed at $40,200, but records show the Macks took several mortgages out on the property with an original total value of $181,500, though Mack has denied the home carries so much debt. A $48,000 mortgage taken out on the house in 2003 originally carried an initial interest rate of 9.9 percent, nearly double the average rates at the time.
Mack entered into another $20,600 mortgage in April 2010 with Lena Brolo, a Burlington County woman named a defendant in the Tioga foreclosure filing. Days after entering into the mortgage agreement, Mack raised eyebrows by loaning his mayoral campaign $20,000. State campaign finance rules require loans from outside parties be reported and loans are not allowed to exceed the $2,600 campaign contribution limit for individuals.
Brolo could not be reached for comment yesterday, but Brolo's ex-husband Randy said he has no idea if Mack ever paid back the $20,000 loan.
“If he's not paying his PSE&G bill, why is he going to pay that?” he said.
In 2010, a judge in their alimony case asked Lena Brolo to account for all her income, but she never answered, he said.
“The judge had ordered her, but she disobeyed,” Randy Brolo said.
Just two weeks ago, Mack was hit with yet another foreclosure notice from TD Bank, this one for the West State Street property owned under the Foremost name. A spokeswoman for TD Bank said she too could not reveal any details about the status of the foreclosure or the mortgage, a seven-year, $85,500 agreement entered into in 2003 with Commerce Bank.
In 2012, city taxes on the three properties in Mack's name will top $12,500. Several recent payments for the Hampton Street property have been late, according to city tax records.
At a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Monday, Mack appeared confident and well-rested. But Bethea said the last few weeks have weighed heavily on the mayor.
On Wednesday, the councilman met with Mack at the Marriott downtown. He said he wanted to discuss the mayor's state of mind and give him support.
“I don't turn my back on my friends,” Bethea said. “My heart goes out to him.”
Mack said he was fine, but admitted the FBI raid and public scrutiny had been “devastating” for his family.
“He said, ‘I'm innocent,'” Bethea said.
At the end of the meeting, Bethea suggested he and the mayor pray. The two knelt their heads, closed their eyes, and Bethea spoke.
“Father God, give Mack the strength that he needs during these trying times,” he said.

These “charges” are associated with a Higgs field. As particles pass through this field they interact with the “charges,” and this interaction makes them act as if they had mass. Heavier particles do so more, and lighter particles do so less. The Higgs mechanism is essential to the masses of elementary particles.
The Higgs particle, or Higgs boson, is the vestige of the simplest proposed model of what created the Higgs field in the first place. Contrary to popular understanding, the Higgs field gives mass — not the Higgs boson. But a discovery of the Higgs boson would tell us that the Higgs mechanism is right and help us pin down the theory that underlies both the Higgs mechanism and the Standard Model.
In the simplest implementation of the Higgs mechanism, the experimental consequence is the Higgs boson. It is the particle that the experimentalists are now searching for.
Photo
Of course, Higgs is also the name of the person, Peter Higgs, who first developed the underlying theory (along with five others who will be in contention for the Nobel Prize if and when the Higgs particle is discovered.)
Q. How will we know it when we find it?
A. In the simplest implementation of the Higgs mechanism, we know precisely what the properties of the Higgs boson should be. That's because of its connection to the Higgs mechanism, which tells us that its interactions with any particular particle are determined by that particular particle's mass.
Knowing the interactions, we can calculate how often the Higgs boson should be produced and the ways in which it should decay. It can decay only into those particles that are light enough for energy to be conserved. Roughly speaking, the Higgs boson decays into the heaviest such particles the most often, since it interacts with them the most strongly.
What we don't know, however, is the Higgs boson's mass. The Higgs boson decays differently, depending on its mass, since a heavier Higgs boson can decay in ways that a light Higgs boson can't. So when experimenters look for the Higgs boson, they look over a range of masses and employ a variety of search strategies.

Q. What do we know about it so far?
A. Experimenters have already ruled out a large range of masses. The Higgs boson, if it exists, has to be heavier than 114.4 giga-electron volts (GeV), which are the units of mass that particle physicists use. By comparison, protons, the bedrock of ordinary matter, are about 1 giga-electron volt, and an electron is only half a million electron volts.

Based on recent searches by the L.H.C., the Higgs boson is also excluded between about 140 GeV and 500 GeV. This makes the most likely region for the Higgs mass to be between about 115 and 140 GeV, which is the range Tuesday's results should focus on, although in principle heavier Higgs boson masses are in contention too.
I don't want to shatter hopes, but don't count on Tuesday's results being definitive. This is the toughest range of masses for the L.H.C., and detection is tricky for this range. I suspect they will have enough evidence not to exclude the Higgs, but too little to fully pin it down without next year's data.
Q. What difference does its mass make?
A. Actually, as far as matter's properties go, it doesn't really make a great deal of difference. As long as the Higgs mechanism is in place, elementary particles that we know about will have the masses that they do.
Photo
But no one thinks the Higgs is the final word about what underlies the Standard Model of particle physics, the theory that describes the most basic elements of matter and the forces through which they interact. Even if the Higgs boson is discovered, the question will still remain of why masses are what they are.
According to quantum field theory — the theory that combines quantum mechanics and special relativity — masses would be expected to be ten thousand trillion times bigger. Without some deeper ingredient, a fudge of that size would be required to make it all hang together. No particle physicist believes that.
We all expect a richer theory underlying the Standard Model. That's one reason the mass matters to us. Some theories only accommodate a particular range of masses. Knowing the mass will give us insight into what that deeper underlying theory is.
Q. Is the L.H.C. a flop if we don't find the Higgs boson?
A. The great irony is that not finding a Higgs boson would be spectacular from the point of view of particle physics, pointing to something more interesting than the simple Higgs model. Future investigations could reveal that the particle playing the role of the Higgs has interactions aside from the ones we know have to be there for particles to acquire mass.
The other possibility is that the answer is not the simple, fundamental particle that the Large Hadron Collider currently is looking for. It could be a more complicated object or part of a more complex sector that would take longer to find.

Q. Does this have anything to do with neutrinos — specifically, the ones that were recently reported as having traveled faster than light on a journey that originated at CERN?
A. Neutrinos have tiny masses. The Higgs mechanism is probably partially responsible for those, too. Just nothing that encourages them to go faster than light (which they most likely don't).
Q. In 1993, the U.S. Congress canceled a larger American collider, the superconducting super collider, which would have been bigger than the CERN machine. Would it have found the Higgs particle years ago?
A. Yes, if it had gone according to schedule. And it would have been able to find things that weren't a simple Higgs boson, too. The L.H.C. can do such searches as well, but with its lower energy the work is more challenging and will require more time.
Move over, Mars rover, it's time for an upgrade.
NASA has unveiled a new concept for a vehicle that could one day transport people on the Red Planet.
The latest model is 8.5 metres long, 4.3 metres wide and 3.3 metres high, sitting on six massive wheels and weighing 2.7 tonnes. It can carry up to four astronauts and has a detachable mobile lab.
Despite its bulk, the vehicle can reach a speed of 110 km/h, thanks to an electric motor powered by solar panels and a 700-volt battery, though it's not likely to travel more than 24 km/h in the atmosphere and terrain of Mars.
NASA commissioned the futuristic design from Florida-based Parker Brothers Concepts, and unveiled the vehicle at the Kennedy Space Center this week as part of a Summer of Mars exhibit.
The design is "based on NASA science," with input from the agency's subject-matter experts, the agency said in a news release.
"It features life-support systems, navigation and communication systems, and design and materials that relate to conditions and resources on Mars," NASA said.
Two previous rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, landed on Mars in 2004. Spirit went out of commission in 2010, but Opportunity is still going. The two have produced hundreds of thousands of images and reams of data.
Then there's Curiosity, which arrived on Mars in 2012 with the most advanced scientific equipment to date. It can send back raw images and video, and capture rock, soil and air samples, which it analyzes on board.
NASA expects to send a robotic rover back to Mars in 2020, when it will "search for signs of past microbial life and collect core samples for a potentially future return to Earth," the agency said.
Some of the elements of the concept rover could be incorporated into the design.
The rogue state says it wants an end to "hostile policies," but is still developing its nuclear program.
The DPRK has signaled several times over the course of the summer that it is reviewing its nuclear policy and that a central feature of the review is connected with the "hostile policy" of the United States. Against this backdrop, North Korea's foreign ministry released a lengthy statement last Friday. The statement did not contain any surprises.
Instead, it provided a straightforward explanation of how North Korea sees the world, arguing that despite a stream of U.S. assurances over the course of the past two decades, a U.S. attitude of hostility toward the DPRK has prevented confrontation from being resolved. (Of course, what stands behind the argument is the unwavering decades long opposition that U.S. policymakers have held toward North Korea's nuclear development.)
One point the memorandum makes well is that the nuclear issue was not the origin of U.S.-DPRK confrontation and that "from the very beginning, the U.S. defined the DPRK as an enemy and refused to recognize its sovereignty." The North Korean foreign ministry argues that the United States opposed the DPRK from the very beginning and refused to establish diplomatic relations with Pyongyang while establishing relations with the Soviet Union and other Communist countries in Eastern Europe. The United States and the DPRK are still technically at war. In other words, the North Korean nuclear problem is really just one symptom of a deeper predicament that characterizes U.S.-DPRK relations. This characterization signals the possibility of yet another North Korean effort to engage with the United States on peace talks rather than on nuclear talks.

Lightweight, flexible electronics printed over large areas could take the weight out of e-readers and cell phones and could potentially be less expensive. However, it's a challenge to adapt the processes and materials used to make today's rigid glass displays to new substrates, such as plastic. Glass manufacturer Corning now suggests an alternative: It's testing a flexible glass substrate for printed electronics that the company says will offer the performance of glass with the flexibility of plastic.
Twists and turns: At the Society for Information Display conference in Seattle, Corning exhibited glass that bends like plastic. The piece shown here is encased in protective plastic and is 75 micrometers thick.
Most screens currently on the market–in televisions, computers, portable electronics, and other devices–are liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) controlled by thin-film silicon transistor arrays built on rigid glass backplanes. Corning, along with Samsung Corning Precision Materials, a company jointly owned with Samsung, currently supplies more than half the display glass used to make LCDs. But as consumers increasingly adopt portable electronics where weight, durability, and energy efficiency are more critical, new display technologies are emerging that may better meet these needs, and challenge the dominance of LCDs. Corning's work on flexible glass is a direct response to the emergence of new display technologies, says Jill VanDewoestine, program manager for flexible substrates at Corning. VanDewoestine is demonstrating the glass in an exhibit booth this week at the Society for Information Display's annual conference in Seattle.
Flexible substrates can also be used to print large-area electronics, including displays and solar cells on roll-to-roll systems like those used to print newspapers, potentially enabling cost-cutting volume production, says VanDewoestine. Companies including Hewlett-Packard, Phicot, Plastic Logic, and Prime View International are working on lightweight, flexible plastic and metal-based display backplanes. These technologies aren't on the market yet, and it's not clear that they will match the performance of silicon-on-glass when brought to high-volume production.
“Glass is a great surface for building thin-film devices on,” says Carl Taussig, director of the Information Surfaces Lab at Hewlett-Packard Labs in Palo Alto, CA. Glass is impermeable, meaning water can't seep into it and damage organic electronics (which tends to be a problem with plastic), and its surface is also very smooth, which means it's much easier to build perfectly structured, high-performance electronics on top of it. Glass can furthermore be used to make transparent displays, which isn't possible with metal. And it has the advantage of compatibility with high-temperature processing. Electronics made at high temperatures tend to have better performance; their structure is better, so they switch faster, which in a display means a crisper, more beautiful picture.
Glass roll: Thin, flexible display glass can be spooled and used for roll-to-roll printing.
Corning's flexible display glass is just 75 micrometers thick. VanDewoestine acknowledges that the concept of manufacturing durable electronics on flexible glass is counterintuitive. “People think manufacturing on flexible glass is impossible because they think about TVs getting broken by Wii remotes,” she says. The company is not saying how tough and strong the material is, but representatives say these properties should match those of thicker glass because the strength of glass is independent of its thickness.
Corning has sent out samples of the flexible glass to manufacturing partners to test on roll-to-roll manufacturing lines. VanDewoestine says the company's partners are building electronic devices on the substrate; the company expects to reveal some of this work in scientific publications later this year, but is not currently disclosing any details.
Jennifer Lewis, professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, says she is excited about the potential for flexible glass. “This will enable a broader array of materials to be integrated into flexible electronics, and likely ones with better performance than could be achieved on plastic substrates,” she says.
But there is some skepticism about the compatibility of glass with roll-to-roll manufacturing. HP's Taussig, who is developing roll-to-roll processes for plastic display backplanes, says: “Unfortunately, glass is brittle, so it is still susceptible to scratches, which can lead to cracks and catastrophic failure, which is the last thing you want in a roll-to-roll line.”
VanDewoestine says Corning is aware of such concerns and is addressing the problem by developing packaging that will protect the glass during transport and manufacturing. “The reason flexible glass works is that we make very pure glass with a damage-free surface, and then package it so that it remains defect-free,” she says. The packaging is similar in concept to the packaging the company uses to make glass optical fibers, which are about 125 micrometers wide and flexible.
The Yowamushi Pedal New Generation television anime is partnering with Japanese automaker Subaru, a division of Fuji Heavy Industries for a promotional campaign. Protagonist Sakamichi Onoda appearsin a Subaru television commercial.
Yowamushi Pedal New Generation's anime studio TMS Entertainment animated the commercial. In the ad, Sakamichi takes his bike out of a Subaru Levorg. Then he speeds down a mountain road alongside the car.
Subaru has provided an official support car for the Japan Cup Cycle Road Race for more than 20 years. Subaru's partnership with the anime is based on its feeling that the company "wants to further boost the road race scene."
The commercial debuted on television in Japan on Monday, and Subaru began streaming the commercial after it aired. The anime's fourth episode, "Minegayama de Ichiban Hayai Otoko" (The Fastest Man at Minegayama), will also premiere on Monday.
Subaru partnered with the anime studio Gainax for the Hōkago no Pleiades (Afterschool Pleiades) original net anime in 2011. The series inspired an anime film in 2013, four-panel manga in 2014, and television anime in 2015. The car manufacturer unveiled a one-of-a-kind itasha car with the anime's characters in 2015. Subaru also collaborated with the live-action Attack on Titan films in 2015, and mecha designer Shoji Kawamori recreated the company's “EyeSight” Driving Support System as a fictional robot in 2013.
The Shadow Chancellor has called for politicians to formulate policies for a world where borders will no longer be relevant.
John McDonnell said the migration crisis triggered by the civil war in Syria had already shown many people prepared to simply ignore borders in their desperation to flee conflict.
He also suggested the Government should be taking in more refugees from the Middle East, although he said precise numbers were a matter for "negotiation with our European partners".

Outrage at Cameron 'bunch of migrants' jibe
Cabinet Minister repeats 'bunch of migrants' comments
_________________________________________________________________________
He identified war, poverty and climate change as the key drivers behind mass movements of people, which he argued would mean a world without meaningful borders "by the end of this century".
"Inevitably in this century we will have open borders, we're seeing it in Europe already. The movement of peoples across the globe will mean that borders are almost going to become irrelevant by the end of this century, so we should be preparing for that and explaining why people move," Mr McDonnell told the BBC's Sunday Politics programme.
Pressed on whether this might mean a world where people no longer respect national boundaries, he said:
"I think at the end of this century that's what will occur. We're seeing people ignoring borders already as they fly from Syria, so therefore what we should be doing is making sure there's no forced movement, we look at the push and pull factors and we ensure we have conflict prevention, tackling of inequality and also policies that tackle climate change. In that way we can cope with the global pressures that come from population movement."
'BUNCH OF MIGRANTS'
Although his comments referred to some years down the line, they are bound to be seized upon by the Conservatives, who have made great play over Jeremy Corbyn's supposedly "open-door" policy on immigration.
The issue was the subject of a fierce argument earlier this week when David Cameron said the Labour leader had met a "bunch of migrants" in Calais and offered to let them into the UK.
This morning's comments from Mr McDonnell will do little to dampen that row, as the Shadow Chancellor suggested the UK should be offering to take more people fleeing the conflict than the 20,000 the Government has so far pledged.
"I think we should, I think we should cooperate with others and carry the burden because we're seeing, as with the refugee crisis, the majority of Britons want us to rise to that and ensure that we assist others and that others aren't suffering, that we don't stand on one side as people suffer," he said.
Federal security officials are resisting pressure to reveal how many people are on Canada's no-fly list, arguing the information could help terrorists plot a catastrophic attack on an airliner.
In newly filed court documents, the government also contends that divulging the figure might damage relations with key allies, especially the United States.
Information Commissioner Suzanne Legault is challenging the government's refusal to disclose the data to a Montreal journalist who requested it under the Access to Information Act.
La Presse reporter Daphne Cameron filed two requests for figures from 2006 through 2010 — one for the total number of people on the list, the second for the number of Canadian citizens.
Legault's office investigated Cameron's complaint against Transport Canada and recommended last year that the agency release the figures.
Transport Canada refused to comply, prompting Legault to take the case to the Federal Court of Canada.
Minister has final say over list
Under the no-fly program in place since June 2007, airlines rely on a list of individuals considered "an immediate threat to civil aviation" should they board an aircraft.
Candidates for the no-fly roster — formally known as the Specified Persons List — are put forward by the RCMP and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.
Members of these agencies, along with representatives of Transport, the Canada Border Services Agency and the Justice Department, sit on an advisory panel that formally recommends names for inclusion.
The public safety minister has the final say.
In withholding the numbers, Transport Canada invoked a section of the access law shielding information whose release could interfere with the conduct of international affairs as well as the detection, prevention or suppression of "hostile activities."
Refusal challenged
In her May 2013 letter to then-transport minister Denis Lebel, filed with the court, Legault said she was not satisfied the exemption had been properly applied.
Disclosing an aggregate number of people on the no-fly list "would not allow an individual to determine whether he or she is on the list," she wrote.
The roster is only one of a number of lists used by airlines to ensure aviation security, Legault added.
Therefore, even if someone could conclude they were on the list, "this fact would not transform Canadian or Canadian-bound aircraft into 'soft targets,' as claimed by (Transport Canada)."
Christopher Free, a senior Transport Canada intelligence official, was consulted by Transport's Access to Information division in March 2010 on whether the figures could be disclosed.
Free concluded the number of names "was valuable information for terrorist operational planning" and that its release would harm national security, he says in an affidavit filed recently with the court.
"This determination is based on my understanding of how terrorist groups operate," says Free, chief of operational and intelligence support within the aviation security operations branch of Transport.
"In order to plan and execute a successful attack and minimize risk, terrorist organizations must first solve the 'intelligence problem' of knowing and understanding the strengths, weaknesses and opportunities available with respect to their target."
CSIS, Public Safety back bid to protect info
Portions of Free's filing have been blacked out, with the court's permission, in keeping with federal concerns about maintaining secrecy.
The United States has revealed there are about 16,000 people — including fewer than 500 Americans — on its no-fly list.
Still, Free says disclosure of the Canadian numbers could "adversely affect our relations with key allies, and especially the U.S."
CSIS and Public Safety Canada back Transport's bid to keep the figures under wraps.
"Although the information may at first appear innocuous, the Service maintains that it would be ill advised to expose the scope of Canada's intelligence knowledge in this specific area of enforcement," CSIS says in an October 2011 memo that has become part of the court file.
In a 2012 report, the watchdog that keeps an eye on CSIS said confusion over how the no-fly list should work had "significantly undermined" its potential to help keep the skies safe.
The Security Intelligence Review Committee said the notion of "an immediate threat to civil aviation" was open to interpretation, and federal agencies had "struggled" with nominating people for the list.
According to the most recent report on the status of the world's fisheries by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, fisheries supply at least 15% of the animal protein consumed by humans, provide direct and indirect employment for nearly 200 million people worldwide and generate $US85 billion annually. This same report indicates that 28% of the world's fisheries stocks are currently being overexploited or have collapsed and 52% are fully exploited.
A new study published in this week's issue of PLoS Biology provides the first global evaluation of how management practices influence fisheries' sustainability. The study assessed the effectiveness of the world's fisheries management regimes using evaluations from nearly 1,200 fisheries experts, analyzing these in combination with data on the sustainability of fisheries catches. The results indicate that most fisheries management regimes are lagging far behind standards set by international organizations, and that the conversion of scientific advice into policy, through a participatory and transparent process, plays the most critical role in determining the sustainability of fisheries.
"The world's fisheries are one of the most important natural assets to humankind," says lead author Camilo Mora, a Colombian researcher at Dalhousie University and the University of California San Diego. "Unfortunately, our use of the world's fisheries has been excessive and has led to the decline or collapse of many stocks."
"The consequences of overexploiting the world's fisheries are a concern not only for food security and socio-economic development but for ocean ecosystems," says Boris Worm, a professor at Dalhousie University and co-author of the paper. "We now recognize that overfishing can also lead to the erosion of biodiversity and ecosystem productivity."
"The different socioeconomic and ecological consequences associated with declining fish stocks are an international concern and several initiatives have been put forward to ensure that countries improve the way they use their marine resources," explains Mora. "Some of these initiatives include the United Nations Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Although these initiatives have been endorsed by most governments, a global assessment on the extent to which these ideals are actually implemented and effective remains lacking."
Mora and his colleagues analyzed a set of attributes upon which country-level fisheries could be evaluated. They pinpointed six parameters, including the scientific quality of management recommendations, the transparency of converting recommendations into policy, the enforcement of policies, the influence of subsidies, fishing effort, and the extent of fishing by foreign entities.
To quantify those attributes the researchers developed a questionnaire designed to elicit worst- to best-case answers. The survey was translated into five languages and distributed to over 13,000 fisheries experts around the world. Nearly 1,200 evaluations were used in the study. The responses of the surveyed experts were compared to, and found to be in accordance with, empirical data, supporting the validity of the data obtained in the study.
The results of this global survey showed that 7% of all coastal states carry out rigorous scientific assessment for the generation of management policies, 1.4% also have a participatory and transparent process to convert scientific recommendations into policy, and less than 1% also implement mechanisms to ensure the compliance with regulations. No one country was additionally free of the effects of excess fishing capacity, subsidies or access to foreign fishing.
"Perhaps the most striking result of our survey was that not a single country in the world was consistently good with respect to all these management attributes. So which countries are doing well and which are not is a question whose answer depends on the specific attribute you are looking at," says Mora.
The results of the study show that wealthier countries, though they have predominantly better science and enforcement capabilities, face the negative repercussions of excessive subsidies and larger fishing capacity, which have resulted largely from increased modernization of national fleets. In contrast, poorer countries largely lacked robust science and enforcement capabilities and although these nations have less fishing capacity nationally, they disproportionally sold fishing rights to nations that did. The study showed that in 33% of the coastal states classified as low-income (commonly countries in Africa and Oceania) most fishing is carried out by foreign fleets from either the European Union, South Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan or the United States. The only attribute in which poorer and wealthier countries overlapped significantly was their limited ability to convert scientific recommendations into policy. The mechanism for this pattern, however, was different. Poor countries reportedly struggle with the effects of corruption while wealthier countries often encounter more political or economical pressures.
For the second part of the study, Mora and his colleagues combined the database on management effectiveness with a recently developed index to assess the probability that the catch of a particular country is sustainable or not. This part of the study showed that out of several attributes analysed, the transparency with which scientific recommendations are turned into policy plays the strongest role in the fate of fisheries sustainability.
"Transparent policy-making is at the centre of the entire process," explains co-author Marta Coll, at the Institut de Ciènces del Mar in Spain. "If this is heavily influenced by political pressures or corruption, it is unlikely that good scientific advice will ever be translated into proper regulations. Similarly, authoritarianism in this process is likely to reduce compliance with the resulting policies."
"This study provided us with a look at both sides of the coin," says Andrew Rosenberg at the University of New Hampshire, who was not involved in the study. "On one hand, it reminds us of the difficult challenges facing fisheries management globally in protecting critical natural resources from overexploitation. On the other hand it delivers a message of hope that when policy-making is transparent, participatory, and based on science, things can improve."

There are a number of trite proverbs related to asking and getting what you want in life, for example "the squeaky wheel gets the grease," "ask and you shall receive," and "the crying baby gets the milk." Well, it wasn't that long ago that a new post popped up in the Lichess Feedback Forum (the developers and staff do browse the forums!) squeaking about a new type of tournament - shield tournaments. A shield tournament is one in which a unique profile trophy is up for grabs, and the winner keeps that trophy until they fail to defend it next month in the next tournament of that same time control or variant.
As an example, let's say I get incredibly lucky and win the SuperBlitz Shield Tournament in December. I get a freshly polished SuperBlitz shield trophy in my profile until it's abruptly stolen by Thibault in January's SuperBlitz Shield Tournament. I lose said trophy and he keeps it until it's stolen by in February, and so on.
Shield tournaments for the standard lichess tournament time controls will be held during the first week of the month, and shield tournaments for variants will be held during the third week of the month according to the following schedule:
First Week of the Month:
Third Week of the Month:
So sign up and wrestle for your favorite shield, at the very least to stop a certain user from getting them all and breaking the profile page! Have fun, and keep the excellent suggestions coming - community interaction is what makes lichess so special.
Pakistan ranks as the world's second-worst country in terms of gender equality and equitable division of resources and opportunities among men and women, says a report published Friday.
The Global Gender Gap Report 2013, published by the World Economic Forum in collaboration with faculty at Harvard University and the University of California, Berkeley, assesses 136 countries, representing more than 93 per cent of the world's population, on how well resources and opportunities are divided among male and female populations.
According to the index, Iceland tops the list with the most equitable sharing of resources among the sexes, followed closely by north European countries such as Finland, Norway and Sweden.
Pakistan comes down at 135, followed only by Yemen, and its score has fallen three spots since the study was conducted last year.
The comprehensive annual report measures the size of the gender inequality gap in four areas, including economic participation and opportunity (salaries, participation and highly skilled employment), educational attainment (access to basic and higher levels of education), political empowerment (representation in decision-making structures), health and survival (life expectancy and sex ratio).
According to the index, Pakistan ranks second-worst in economic participation and opportunity, eighth-worst in terms of equal access to education, 13th from the bottom in terms of health and survival.
Surprisingly, the magnitude of disparities is much smaller in Pakistan when it comes to political empowerment and representation in decision-making structures among the two sexes, with a rank of 64 among 136 countries.
Among neighbouring countries, China ranked at 69, Bangladesh at 75, India at 101 and Iran at 130. Afghanistan was not included in the study.
Global gender gap narrows slightly in 2013
According to the report, gender disparity narrowed slightly in the current year on the back of definite if not universal improvements in economic equality and political participation between the sexes.
Overall, the report found Iceland the most advanced country in the world in terms of gender equality for the fifth year running. It, along with Finland (2nd), Norway (3rd) and Sweden (4th), has now closed over 80 per cent of its gender gap. These countries were joined in the top 10 by the Philippines, which enters the top five for the first time, Ireland (6th), New Zealand (7th), Denmark (8th), Switzerland (9th) and Nicaragua (10th).
At the global level, the report found that in 2013, 96 per cent of the health and survival gender gap has now been closed. “It is the only one of the four pillars that has widened since the report was first compiled in 2006.”
The global gender gap stands at 93 per cent in terms of education, with 25 countries having closed their gaps completely.
The report says gender gaps for economic equality and political participation are only 60 per cent and 21 per cent closed respectively, although progress is being made in these areas, with political participation narrowing by almost 2 per cent over the last year.
In both developing and developed countries alike, relative to the numbers of women in tertiary education and in the workforce overall, women's presence in economic leadership positions is limited, it adds.

Matt Barnes, formerly #22 of the Los Angeles Clippers, stands on the court during a game against the San Antonio Spurs during Game Four of the Western Conference Quarterfinals at the AT&T Center on April 26, 2015 in San Antonio, Texas.
The days of the NBA “bad boy” are coming to an end. If you think otherwise, your take on the concept is all wrong. We're talking about the trash-talking, brawl-beginning, fine-and-suspension-inducing, me-against-the-world mold of player that has flourished in the league for decades. With Matt Barnes' Instagram-announced retirement (as a player) Monday, only a few are left in the league.
There's DeMarcus “Boogie” Cousins, Draymond Green and perhaps even LeBron James. But even within this diminishing cohort, physical altercations have been replaced with petty wars of attrition. Instead of meeting toe-to-toe on the hardwood, players throw shade at each other via pregame outfits and custom T-shirts and hats. Players defending themselves via photos or in 280 characters or fewer — sometimes even under the alias of a dummy account (sorry, Kevin Durant). But don't get it twisted: This new version of warfare is still entertaining. It's just different.
On Nov. 28, James did earn his first career ejection since joining the league in 2003, but the outburst only cost him a $4,000 fine — chump change compared with what the league has levied on a player like Matt Barnes. In 14 seasons with nine different teams, Barnes accrued a whopping $414,276 in fines and six games of suspension, according to spotrac.com, which compares with James' career total of $51,000 in fines and zero games of suspensions over 15 seasons and counting.
With Barnes saying farewell to the game, the NBA has lost a bad boy from a long lineage of audacious NBA players, often traced back to the “Bad Boys” era of the late 1980s/early 1990s, Detroit Pistons teams, featuring Isiah Thomas, Bill Laimbeer, Dennis Rodman, John Salley and Rick Mahorn. The fraternity of infamous hoopers also includes Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, Charles Oakley, Reggie Miller, Vernon Maxwell, Latrell Sprewell, Isaiah Rider, Kevin Garnett, Rasheed Wallace, Kobe Bryant and Metta World Peace, aka the man formerly known as Ron Artest.
Like many of these players, maybe Barnes crossed the line one too many times throughout his career. Or, maybe, he's just fearless. Here are the top five moments from the now-retired forward's playing days that embody his bad boy nature while blurring that fine line between craziness and passion for the game.
March 7, 2010 — MATT BARNES vs. KOBE BRYANT
Fine: None
It takes a certain type of man to go at Bryant — and that man has to have a backbone like Barnes. In a March 2010 game between the Orlando Magic and Los Angeles Lakers, less than a year removed from the teams' matchup in the 2009 NBA Finals, Bryant and Barnes went back and forth all afternoon until their chippy confrontations climaxed in the third quarter, when they came chest-to-chest and the resulting jawing led both players to be whistled for technical fouls. “He's the man, but s—,” Barnes said of Bryant after the game. “You gotta clean it up or something is gonna happen.” On an inbounds play after the verbal altercation, Barnes faked as if he would throw the ball in Bryant's face, but the reigning Finals MVP didn't budge. “I knew he wasn't going to do s—,” Bryant told reporters after the Lakers' 96-94 loss. “What would I flinch for?” Barnes came at the Black Mamba, and, technically, he missed. But he came correct, which you gotta respect. (In July 2010, Barnes became a teammate with Bryant after signing as a free agent with the Lakers.)
Dec. 12, 2014 — Matt Barnes vs. the water bottle
Clippers' Matt Barnes was fined $25K for kicking a water bottle into the stands and directing profane language at fans at Wizards yesterday. — Marc J. Spears (@MarcJSpearsESPN) December 13, 2014
Fine: $25,000
In three seasons playing with the Los Angeles Clippers from 2012 to 2015, Barnes received a total of 32 fines, including one for $25,000 after a road matchup with the Washington Wizards in December 2014. After Clippers head coach Doc Rivers pulled his starters with about two minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, essentially conceding the game, Barnes returned the sideline, where he kicked a water bottle into the stands before cursing at the home team's fans. This is one of four $25,000 fines that the NBA issued to Barnes during his tenure as a Clipper, but spoiler alert: It's far from the highest fine of his career.
May 6, 2015 — Matt Barnes vs. Monja Willis, aka James Harden's mom
Fine: $52,000 ($50,000 for remark to Monja Willis, $2,000 for technical foul)
OK, sometimes Matt Barnes' went wayyyyy too far with the trash talk. In the first quarter of Game 2 of the 2015 Western Conference semifinals between the Houston Rockets and Los Angeles Clippers, James Harden received a hard foul from Barnes, his primary defender. As Harden walked to the free throw line, Barnes intentionally bumped into him, which led a referee to whistle him for a technical foul. The play resulted in a rain of negative chants from Houston fans directed toward Barnes, who responded by reportedly yelling, “Suck my d—, b—-!” to the crowd. On the receiving end of the profane remark was Monja Willis, Harden's mother, who would later tell TMZ that the Clippers player immediately apologized for the comment. “My older son walked over to him and told him to apologize … and he did,” Willis said. “What he told me was that he would never want to disrespect anyone's mother because his mother passed from cancer … and that he was sorry. I accept his apology.” Barnes denied making the reported remark, calling it “untrue” and “crazy.” Regardless of what exactly was said, c'mon, Matt. You gotta leave mothers out of it.
March 17, 2016 — Matt barnes vs. John Henson … and the Bucks Locker room
Fine: $32,205 (one-game suspension without pay)
What happens when a referee ejects a player before Barnes has a chance to speak his mind to him? Well, Barnes runs off the court, through the arena's tunnel and to the opposing team's locker room, of course. That's exactly what happened during a March 2016 game between the Memphis Grizzlies and Milwaukee Bucks, when John Henson received his second technical foul of the night and an immediate ejection after the big man's vicious block on Barnes, who also received a technical foul for his part in the ensuing verbal altercation. Technically, Barnes wasn't ejected from the game. However, he checked himself out of the contest, left the court to find Henson and reportedly made it all the way to Milwaukee's locker room before two security guards had to escort him from the arena. The dedication is oddly commendable, but … For his antics, the league slapped Barnes with a huge fine and made him sit out for a game.
Jan. 17, 2016 — Matt Barnes vs. Derek Fisher
Fine: $35,000 (two-game suspension without pay)
“Knicks coach Derek Fisher was attacked in Los Angeles by NBA bad boy Matt Barnes, who drove 95 miles to ‘beat the s–t out of him' when he found out Fisher was romancing his estranged wife,” reads the opening line of an October 2015 story from the New York Post. The NBA didn't take action on the matter involving Barnes, Fisher and Gloria Govan until December, when the league suspended the then-Memphis Grizzlies forward for two games without pay. Yet, leading up to a January matchup between Memphis and New York — the first encounter between the player and coach, who were former teammates with the Lakers — Barnes spoke negatively about Fisher, including calling him a “snitch” and saying he doesn't “talk to snakes.” The negative comments resulted in a $35,000 fine from the league for “condoning violence.” A month later, Barnes' reputation made it all the way to hip-hop: I just am like, it was my idea to have an open relationship / Now a n—a mad / Now I'm 'bout to drive 90 miles like Matt Barnes to kill … / 30 hours, Kanye West raps on his track “30 hours” from The Life of Pablo. A shout-out like that certainly meant his legacy as an NBA bad boy had been cemented.
BANGOR, Maine — Occupy Bangor is planning a series of events Saturday in Bangor starting with a rally at noon at Peirce Park on Harlow Street, but the city said it won't allow the group's members to camp out in the park after hours.
“The City has an interest in maintaining our parks for the use and enjoyment of all our citizens and visitors,” City Manager Catherine Conlow said in a statement Thursday afternoon. “All those who wish to visit our parks must abide by the rules for their use, just as they must observe other laws designed to protect public property and preserve the peace.”
Like the national Occupy movement, Occupy Bangor is organized around the theme of “finding common ground” within the 99 percent of citizens it says are disenfranchised by the political process.
After the rally at Peirce Park, a march through downtown Bangor is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. Working groups will gather at 3 p.m. before a general assembly forms at 4, Occupy Bangor said in a press release.
“Occupy Bangor, in the spirit of Occupy Wall Street, is outraged over the ever-widening gap between rich and poor in America, as well as corporate control of the political process,” the press release said. “The number of occupations is growing rapidly throughout the country and around the world. There are currently over 900 occupied cities in the United States, and more than 2,200 worldwide.”
In its own press release issued Thursday, the city said it was approached Oct. 21 “by representatives of Occupy Bangor about staging an occupation at Peirce Park, located adjacent to the Library on Harlow Street. As part of this protest, Occupy Bangor has indicated that some participants may choose to camp at Peirce Park.”
The release added, “a careful review of the current ordinances related to the use of City Parks clearly indicates that park hours are 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., Monday through Sunday, and that camping is prohibited in city parks. For that reason, we have asked that the protesters respect the ordinances of the City of Bangor and only occupy Peirce Park only between the hours of 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.”
The release said “it is the responsibility of the City to represent the interests of our residents and visitors fairly, and without bias. That is best accomplished when everyone is required to adhere to the same laws and codes.”
The city urged those involved in the Occupy Bangor protest “to work within and respect Bangor's local laws and ordinances, as other organizations have done and continue to do when exercising their right to assemble in protest.”
Occupy Maine has been encamped in Lincoln Park in Portland since Sept. 30, and Occupy Augusta has been encamped in Capitol Park there since Oct. 15, the Occupy Bangor press release said.
Demonstrators in Portland say Thursday they are undeterred by colder weather and a forecast of light snow.
The number of tents in Lincoln Park has grown to 40, and media team coordinator Denny Junkins says the group is getting prepared for colder weather. The first snow was expected Thursday night, but it was only expected to amount to a dusting.
He said Thursday that the group was cold but not “freezing to death.”
Junkins says the group has no plans to leave. He says they have received donations of warm clothes, and hope to get some heaters in the coming days.
Sunny Hughes, a spokeswoman for Occupy Bangor, said she doesn't have an estimate of how many people might attend Saturday's rally.
“If I had to guess, I would say more than 100,” she said.
A previous Occupy Bangor event outside Bank of America on Exchange Street drew about 60 people on Oct. 12.
The Associated Press contributed to this report.
The Legacy
There was an interesting moment in (or, perhaps more accurately, just outside of) Melee the other day; interesting enough, in my opinion, to stand out from the daily deluge of top player interviews/clips/social media statements that the Platinum Age and its money engenders. Cloud 9's own Mango, who as you're all tired of hearing was the champion of Evolution 2013 and 2014 in Super Smash Brothers Melee, was on a mic alongside the brilliant and charismatic and possibly (in this writer's admittedly biased opinion) sociopathic recent-winner-of-all-the-things Leffen. The clip can be found here:
At one point, as two unfortunate (or possibly fortunate, since their uncommentated match has at the time of this writing been viewed 25,686 times) scrubs duke it out, Mango tells Leffen and the stream why he is going to three-peat. The moment occurs at around 11:00; Mango is half-joking, and the statement is colored by his ever-present and inextricable narcissism and patriotism, but there's a little sincerity in it. PPMD “can't” win, because a PPMD victory would mean that the metagame could proceed piecemeal, by means of one superhuman display of scholarship every six months. Leffen and Hungrybox “can't” win because Mango, in some half-sincere sense, dislikes them personally. And Adam Lindgren–Armada–the earnest young viking whom you all know from third-place finishes at WTFox and the most recent MELEE-FC and a second at CEO–can't win because if he did, his legacy would (even in Mango's own epically biased estimation) rival the legacy of the GOAT himself.
And it would. I won't assault you with statistics, but everyone who follows melee knows it in his heart: if Armada wins this, it means something, insofar as pixels from a Cathode Ray Tube can ever mean something.
The Fire
Mango, these days, talks like a father. He says he has “gas left in the tank” almost wistfully; in more candid moments, he'll admit that he'll never again have the fire of “little kid Mango,” the Neo who saved Melee from Mew2king and Armada's Agents Smith. That selfsame flame–the divine fire that dwells in at least six breasts–once died in Armada; after he established himself as the champion of the world, circa 2012, he retired; he, too, said that he no longer felt “the fire” that he used to. He returned, and lost, and won, and began to lose again. From here, we know what happens: the old guard, still in it for the paychecks, are gradually muscled into irrelevance by young, thirsty wunderkinds (the Leffens and the Westballzes, the scions of a still purer 20XX school). Armada gets third and fourth and occasionally second for a few years, and then one morning we all wake up in a world where he can get fifth–seventh–ninth. He goes back to substitute teaching; he raises a family. It's all faintly sad.
But sometimes–once in a very great while–the fire doesn't die. Some ember from the mighty blaze persists, and glows, until one day, for reasons that have nothing at all to do with money and everything to do with the desire to strive and conquer that every young man feels, it bursts into flame again.
If you follow @ArmadaUGS on Twitter, as I do, you might have noticed a diamond in the rough: between spells of homesickness and grumpy anti-airline rants came a tweet which I'll reproduce in its entirety.
“I'm ready to fight to the very end.
I WANT TO WIN EVO!
I will create a way to actually win in the end”
In The End
In the end. Not at WTFox, not at CEO, not at any of the other wonderful and important tournaments that no one will remember; at Evo, Armada will create a way. The burnt-out veteran–the guy with one foot in the retirement grave–used to make tweets about why he hadn't won, used to accept what fate gave him or grumble about it with a forgivably bad temper. But now–now, on the eve of the largest and most important Melee tournament of all time–He insists that he is unstoppable, that if the world or his opponents try to hold him back he will burn them down.
Some have already insisted that in the face of Leffen's up-and-coming brilliance there is “no way” for Armada to triumph.
It's very possible that there is no way. But that doesn't mean that, with the title of Best of All Time on the line, Adam Lindgren can't make one.
Washington Capitals lose Green, Ward and Fehr. They sign Justin Williams and trade for Oshie. Now they might need to let Johansson walk as they face a likely big arbitration number for their goalie. This is because the Capitals face salary cap issues. They might trade for Bozak, who is a lot less of a player than Johannson.
Yet in the eyes of many unhappy NY Islanders fans, they had a good summer.
I'm not so sure.
Conversely, the NY Islanders lose no one except an aging defenseman in Lubomir Visnovsky, who was frequently hurt, to make room for kids. Kids coming up on a regular basis will become increasingly important as the Islanders close in at the cap ceiling. They also sign a player in Kirill Petrov. Then they trade a guy struggling to make line-up in Griffin Reinhart (especially thanks to the longterm deals for Leddy & Boychuk). That trade essentially yields two first round picks (equal compensation to what Bruins got for NHLer Doug Hamilton), and they ended up killing the draft.
I guess a lot of people tend to forget they KILLED that draft less than a month ago.
Yet there seems to be some who felt the Islanders had a bad summer because didn't sign people to…..play where? A player like Justin Williams, who will be 34 years old, is a right wing who must play the right side. Who in the top 6 of the Islanders should he have replaced? Okposo? Strome?
Or do the Isles sign Williams to be a 3rd line RW at $3.5 million per year? Oh, and then who sits?
Fact is… it makes no sense… Especially ignoring the GLARING fact that the Isles have been unable to move Michael Grabner to give them some cap breathing room. If nothing takes come camp or after, we might see Grabner become displaced and in the AHL. Then it will free the Isles to be able to address items they felt they needed to at camp.
Now I'm all for a higher quality top 4 dman, especially a top puck mover. But seems to me that things are going to have to wait to see what changes or shifts in the market at camp and after. After all, despite some frustration… fact is… it's only JULY!
Sometimes you need to see what you have and are at stake to the market… or right now… the lack thereof. But if the Isles are right on Pulock's development and ready for next steps… a lot of fans are going to look terribly silly with the reams of melodrama on Twitter and forums.
After the emergence of Ryan Strome, Brock Nelson, and Anders Lee… you have to consider that the Islanders are a much better team when the talent churns up. Plus, if Pulock and Mayfield aren't ready, this team still has ample time to correct or address it. The team who came from nowhere just this past draft always seems to have a plan. Why don't we let a bit more of this offseason pass before shaking a fist at the sky, shall we?
Scrolling shooters. You are probably tired of me bringing up that the heyday of this genre being long gone. That is fine. It seems to be working. We are seeing more scrolling shooting games pop up from the independent developer world. That makes me happy. I mean, I still for the most part suck at them but it is fun blasting stuff. Swabby is a new side scrolling shooter for the Sega Master System and it is pulling on the nostalgia strings. Hard.
Swabby was apparently a maze running character that was built into early Sega Master System. I did not know this. Anyhow, Zeus makes a slight mistake in his effort to resurrect the man/beast from Altered Beast. See, that lightning bolt goes just a wee bit deeper into the ground, missing the man/beast and hitting Swabby instead.
There are three levels in Swabby. Each based on a different Sega classic. The first level, the graveyard, is based on Altered Beast. The second level is based on Sonic the Hedgehog while the third and final level is based on Shinobi. Quite an eclectic mix of levels there. This game certainly has variety.
Okay, onto the information on how Swabby plays. Since this is a sidescrolling shooter featuring a snail, reality is thrown out the window. I mean, a god threw a lightning bolt down and gave this snail these powers. You are only able to have one shot in the air at a time. That makes the proceedings quite hard. Second, Swabby can only take one hit at a time before dying and having to start over.
It is rather jarring to be flying along, roasting bad guys and all of a sudden the screen goes dark. This is how you transition from one level to the next in Swabby. I would love for there to be some kind of boss added to each level, something that lets you know that you are at the end of the level.
Other than that, great work. I hope we see more work on Swabby or a follow up or more from this developer. Keep working dude.

The City of Victoria is preparing to throw one of the biggest parties of the year.
A New Year's Eve bash will take place at the Inner Harbour on Dec. 31.
The city will receive $224,000 in federal funding to host the event, which will also mark the kick-off to Canada's 150th anniversary year in 2017.
The event planning is well underway for the family friendly and multicultural celebration.
Among the attractions will be a live show, food vendors and a fireworks display.
However the fireworks show won't take place at midnight, but rather at 9 p.m. to match up with other cities across the country.
“On December 31, a thousand lights will fill the Canadian sky from coast to coast, setting the tone for the celebrations marking the 150th anniversary of Confederation,” said Mélanie Joly, Minister of Canadian Heritage.
Victoria is among 19 Canadian municipalities to be granted funding.
The full event line-up will be revealed in November.

Game of Thrones season 6: Everything we know so far from plot spoilers to premiere date
On Tuesday (Sept. 24), the Wall Street Journal reported that JP Morgan was offering the government $3 billion to settle (paywall) an unspecified number of criminal probes after the Department of Justice threatened to file suit in an investigation of its pre-crisis mortgage dealings. Yesterday, it reported that regulators are looking for something like $11 billion in compensation (paywall), including $7 billion in penalties and $4 billion in consumer relief.
These numbers are still in flux, but depending on how many cases the payment resolves, it would likely be the largest single-bank payout in the history of financial regulation, supplanting HSBC's $1.92 billion money-laundering penalty.
We realized that we're having trouble keeping track of all the trouble the largest bank by asset size in the United States has found itself in. Here's our cheat sheet (pun intended):
Outstanding investigations (2013)
…the [Department of Justice], [Commodity Futures Trading Commission], [Securities and Exchange Commission], and various state attorneys general, as well as the European Commission, UK Financial Services Authority (now known as the Financial Conduct Authority), Canadian Competition Bureau, Swiss Competition Commission and other regulatory authorities and banking associations around the world
Residential mortgage-backed securities. The big kahuna at the heart of the recently reported settlement talks: The Department of Justice, the New York State Attorney General, and the Federal Housing Finance Administration are investigating JPM for allegedly misrepresenting the quality of the underlying home loans in mortgage bonds it sold. US taxpayers took losses on $33 billion of those loans when the government bailed out housing lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008. Obstructing regulatory probes. The Manhattan US Attorney is looking into whether JPM employees criminally obstructed an investigation (see below) into alleged electricity market manipulation by the bank. Hiring the children of powerful Chinese politicians. Is this bribery, or just a good old-fashioned nepotism? A spreadsheet connecting recently-hired princelings to specific deals may be the difference. Maybe they knew about the Madoff Ponzi scheme and didn't tell anyone. According to an internal e-mail from a JPM employee more than a year before financier Bernie Madoff was arrested for defrauding investors, an executive “just told me that there is a well-known cloud over the head of Madoff and that his returns are speculated to be part of a Ponzi scheme.” Libor manipulation. The bank is being investigated for its alleged part in efforts to manipulate Libor, a self-reported benchmark interest rate used as a reference for financial instruments around the world. In its most recent quarterly report, it noted inquiries, including subpoenas, from:
Today, the National Credit Union Administration filed suit against JP Morgan and twelve other financial institutions for manipulating Libor. London Whale criminal investigation. While the bank itself has settled institutional allegations (see below), two former JP Morgan executives have been indicted for fraud charges related to the bank's $6.2 billion loss on credit derivatives last year. Manipulating a corporate bond index. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is preparing an enforcement action against the bank for manipulating markets in connection with the London Whale trade.
Settled investigations (2013)
Settlements paid so far this year: $3.68 billion.
Spending on litigation in 2010, 2011 and 2012: A total of $17.3 billion, according to the bank's annual report (pdf, p.325).
How much the firm expects to spend in litigation in 2013: At least $3.7 billion and perhaps as much as $9.8 billion, according to the report.
The firm's net income in 2012: $21.2 billion
Are we missing any major JPM investigations? Let us know in the annotations.

POLITICO reports:
Adding fuel to its growing feud with President Donald Trump, CNN told POLITICO it will be boycotting the White House Christmas party for the media this year. “CNN will not be attending this year's White House Christmas party,” a CNN spokesperson said. “In light of the President's continued attacks on freedom of the press and CNN, we do not feel it is appropriate to celebrate with him as his invited guests. We will send a White House reporting team to the event and report on it if news warrants.” The annual event, scheduled for Friday at 2 p.m., is typically seen as a time when reporters and their bosses can mingle freely with administration members, but Trump's posture toward the press has been uniquely aggressive.
“Christmas comes early! Finally, good news from @ CNN,” tweeted Sanders.
Tensions are running high between the White House and CNN after President Trump tweeted the news network represents America poorly around the world.
“. @ FoxNews is MUCH more important in the United States than CNN, but outside of the U.S., CNN International is still a major source of (Fake) news, and they represent our Nation to the WORLD very poorly. The outside world does not see the truth from them!,” tweeted Trump on Saturday.

In a famous scene from the classic movie Pretty Woman, wealthy businessman Edward Lewis gives Vivian Ward, a Hollywood hooker, a stunning ruby and diamond necklace worth $250,000 to wear out for the evening. At the sight of the necklace, Vivian's eyes widen and a broad smile lights up her face. Even though it is clear the necklace is only out on loan, Vivian cannot contain her thrill and excitement. Edward, by contrast, displays only the slightest smirk of satisfaction in Vivian's delight with the jewels.
Movies and television shows are replete with this gender dichotomy in emotional expressiveness, with strong men who say little and reveal even less with their facial expressions (think Dirty Harry, the Duke, Agent Gibbs, Walt Longmire), and equally strong but very expressive women who wear their hearts on their sleeves (think Scarlet O'Hara, Ellen Ripley, Erin Brockovich, Bridget Jones). But is this simply a Hollywood stereotype, or are women in fact more emotionally expressive than men?
New research by McDuff, Kodra, Kaliouby, & LaFrance suggests they are. And they aren't. Women do smile more than men, and there is evidence that women exaggerate facial expressions for positive emotion. However, McDuff and colleagues believe that smiling and other displays of positive emotion are only part of the picture. Emotions can be negative as well as positive, and within each valence there are a range of distinct emotional states, including fear, disgust, anger, joy, satisfaction, and gratitude.
To explore sex differences in facial expressions across different affective states, McDuff and colleagues developed a unique paradigm for evaluating facial behaviors in response to emotional stimuli. They recruited more than 2000 participants from five different countries to watch advertisements for different, commonly-used products. Participants watched the ads from their own computers, with the understanding that they would be videotaped through their webcams as they viewed. Only participants who felt reasonably comfortable having their reactions recorded were included in the study.
McDuff and colleagues used an automated facial coding system to evaluate the facial expressions of the men and women as they watched the ads. This coding system tied facial behaviors (e.g., smiling) to the movements of specific facial muscles (e.g., contractions of the zygomatic major muscle). Investigators coded smiles, inner and outer brow raises, brow furrows, and lip corner depressors (to see these facial behaviors in isolation, click here). McDuff and colleagues measured not only the frequency of different expressions, but their durations as well.
In some ways, the results from this study confirm previous findings of greater emotional expressiveness for women. Women did smile more often than men in response to the ads, and their smiles were longer in duration. They also engaged in more inner brow raises, though the duration of these brow raises did not differ from that of men. These data not only align with the belief that women are more likely than men to display emotion, but also suggest that this tendency extends to negative as well as positive emotions, as inner brow raises are thought to be reflective of states of fear and sadness.
In other ways, however, the data from McDuff and colleagues suggest a more nuanced account of sex differences in expressiveness. Women were not universally more expressive than men, as men were more likely to demonstrate anger-based facial behaviors than women. Men showed more brow furrowing than women, and their brow furrows were longer than those of women as well. In addition, lip corner depressors were significantly longer in men than in women.
This pattern of findings, with women expressing more happiness and sadness, and men expressing more anger, could reflect social conventions about gender-appropriate behavior. If so, these conventions seem to hold across several different cultures, as the general pattern of findings was consistent across the five countries (US, Germany, UK, China, France) included in the study. Although the magnitude of the sex differences varied somewhat across cultures (e.g., women smiled reliably more than men in Germany, the UK and the US but not France or China), the directionality of the data were the same regardless of the country.
McDuff's paradigm offers a number of advantages over some of the previous lab-based paradigms used to evaluate facial expressions. First, the researchers included a very large sample. McDuff and colleagues tested ten times the number of participants than are tested in a typical laboratory study, lending confidence that the sex differences observed here are reflective of those in the general population. Second, this study assessed facial expressions made in response to naturalistic stimuli in everyday settings, further increasing the generalizability of the findings. Third, researchers collected data from five countries, enabling a cross-cultural comparison of emotional expressiveness.
Despite these advantages, there are still more questions to be answered. Are women and men relatively more expressive for happiness and anger, respectively, because they experience these emotions more intensely? Unfortunately, participants did not report their internal emotional reactions to the ads, and so there is no way to make a direct connection between facial expression and emotional experience. In addition, because the researchers focused on facial behaviors rather than distinct internal emotional states, little is known about sex differences in reactions to specific states like disgust, hope, or gratitude. As scientists further pursue these questions, we can be fairly confident in one thing: Despite Hollywood portrayals, women are not universally expressive and men are not consistently stoic. Instead, the intensity of the reaction is likely to depend not only on the sex of the individual but also on the specific emotional state.
Oh boy.
What he's referring to is his own crazy ranting about how we should let Hillary Clinton be president because of Russia; he also called for another election. Maybe he missed it but the Constitution already has a process for this so even if Trump was impeached (unlikely), Pence would be president. Then Paul Ryan.
And then to challenge prominent Conservatives on Twitter like Jonah Goldberg, Ben Howe, Stephen Miller and others to debate this? Peter clearly missed that whole, “Don't start none won't be none” thing … this was brutal.
Their memories are short and selective.
RUSSIA! RUSSIA! RUSSIA!
Jonah didn't even really bother with him, lol.

Virgin Island Sen. Alicia "Chucky" Hansen says that she is "not a 'no' person." And that, she explained this week, is why she has a hard time understanding how a person could possibly be raped by a spouse.
As the St. Thomas Source reported Tuesday, the comments came during a debate over the wording of a bill that would "add protections for spouses, men and women, who are the victims of actions that constitute rape or unlawful sexual contact in aggravated domestic violence instances." The proposal would strike the phrase "not the perpetrator's spouse" to the current definition of aggravated rape, rape in the second and third degree and unlawful sexual contact, a loophole that the bill's sponsor Sen. Sammuel Sanes calls "an embarrassment in this day and age." The Source reported that before voting against it, Hansen declared she didn't get it how a wife could be raped by a husband, explaining, "If it is forcefully against the will of a spouse then that is a problem. But if a woman says no and he still wants something, I don't know how you can call it rape. Maybe because I am not a 'no' person, I don't know." It says she added, "Some of them just like it. They are the ones that need to be educated. I don't want to describe who they are, nationality. If the man don't hit them, they say the man don't love them."

Hansen is sadly not alone in her inability to grasp that forcing yourself sexually upon another person – even a person to whom you are married – is a crime. Just earlier this year, Washington state moved to remove the spousal exemption for third-degree rape and "indecent liberties." And this week, the Associated Press reported the results of a survey of 10,000 men in Bangladesh, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Papua New Guinea – by declaring that "About one in four men in some parts of Asia admitted raping a woman, according to the first large studies of rape and sexual violence. About one in 10 admitted raping a woman who was not their partner." The survey asked the men if they had "ever forced a woman to have sex when she wasn't willing or if they had ever forced sex on someone who was too drunk or drugged to consent," and, as the AP explained, "Scientists concluded between 6 to 8 percent of men raped a woman who wasn't their partner. When they included wives and girlfriends, the figures were mostly between 30 to 57 percent." (The original AP headline, "Study: 1 in 10 Men in Parts of Asia Have Raped" has now been changed to "Study: 1 in 4 Men in Parts of Asia Have Raped.")
It's clear from the findings that there are plenty of men out there who take for granted that forcing sex upon a partner is something that comes with the territory, that it's a different class of behavior. What's depressing is the way the AP's reporting on the survey results serves only to reinforce that very idea. As L.V. Anderson writes in Slate, "Many people still think that 'rape' means 'stranger rape.'" But the American Bar Association estimates that "nearly 25% of women and 7.6% of men were raped and/or physically assaulted by a current or former spouse, cohabiting partner, or dating partner/acquaintance at some time in their lifetime." So here's a tip to remember, whether you're a journalist or a senator or a person in a relationship: Raping a person who is your partner is called rape.
When I was thinking about an iconography for DRM, I began to think back to the old days of recording vinyl onto my portable tape deck using a 5-pin DIN plug to connect the two machines, the advent of tape-to-tape decks, and being poised over the pause button to record tracks from John Peel sessions. It was all so simple and blissfully analogue in those days, without a hint of copy protection in place.
Well, that isn't strictly true.
I dimly recalled that there was a form of copy-restriction placed on some vinyl albums. A high-pitched frequency was pressed into the album, which was inaudible to the human ear during playback, but which would destabilise the process of recording the album to cassette tape.
The reason I remember it more than anything was that a family friend had built some sort of decoder to eliminate the frequency, and was hoping, should it become widely adopted, to become rich on the back of selling little gizmos that would strip this primitive analogue rights management from recordings.
Unfortunately, copy-protection for vinyl appears to be one of those technological developments that seems to have slipped down the internet's collective memory hole. I couldn't find very much about it on the web at all, and of the stuff I did find, some of it seemed wrong or difficult to verify.
It may be that this was more common in the USA than the UK, but take this claim in Ram Samudrala's 1998 paper 'Creativity and ownership: where is the balance?' that:
'When recording artists started objecting to this (Elvis Costello released his album Almost Blue with a sticker indicating that it didn't contain a spoiler signal), the industry gave up this effort.'
As far as I'm aware the album did come with a sticker on the front in the UK, but it was one that was defensive of Costello's move into 'genre' music, rather than a protest against anti-piracy measures:
'Warning: This album contains country & western music, and may be harmful to narrow minds.'
Then there is this 1999 article by Barry Fox from the New Scientist - "The pirate's tale". This puts the origination of this tactic down to The Beatles:
'It didn't take the recording industry long to see the danger [of the compact cassette]. When the Beatles founded the company Apple, they hired a colourful Greek character called "Magic Alex" Mardas. Together they hatched a plan to put a "spoiler" signal on the Beatles's next album, Sergeant Pepper. The record would play normally, but anyone who tried to copy it onto a blank cassette would find their recording ruined.
Magic Alex added a 20-kilohertz tone to the music, a frequency just above human hearing. But when the signal was copied onto tape, it interfered with the similarly high "bias frequency" which analogue tape recorders use to mobilise the magnetic particles in recording tape. The two signals produced a lower "beat frequency" that sounded like a whistle.
Although the spoiler worked in the lab, with engineers who wanted it to work using high-quality equipment, the real world is nothing like this ideal. Needles on domestic record players ignored the signal, often physically destroying the delicate groove in the vinyl that produced the spoiler. Even if the stylus did read the signal, it was usually filtered out by unwanted capacitance and inductance in the connecting leads. So people who bought Sergeant Pepper found that it copied perfectly. Apple and Magic Alex abandoned their idea.'
This is almost certainly wrong in attributing the development to The Beatles. "Magic Alex" Mardas was not the revolutionary engineer he portrayed himself to be. In 1995, in an article about what became of The Beatle's hangers-on, The Independent described him as:
'The Greek TV repairman, set up in Apple Electronics by the Beatles, who promised to build an artificial sun, a telephone you told who to call, wallpaper loudspeakers, a house which hovered supported by an invisible beam, and even a flying saucer. Not one invention was made, and the recording studio he built proved unusable and was demolished. Allen Klein fired him, and he has since disappeared.'
Additionally, Sergeant Pepper was released by Parlophone in 1967, not Apple. The Beatle's first album release for Apple was the double-vinyl set that became commonly known as "The White Album".
It may be that this story is due to confusion with the fact that Sergeant Pepper does in fact contain a very high frequency signal on it - but only for a very short duration. At the end of side 2 on the original vinyl release, the long drawn out chord that closes "A Day In The Life" leads into a short snippet of nonsense noise that repeats infinitely in a locked-groove.
Just prior to this, a very high pitch frequency is included, designed to attract the attention of any dogs who were around when the album was being played. However, it was included as a joke for a couple of seconds, and not as a serious attempt to prevent home recording of the album.
Where Barry Fox wasn't wrong was in his assessment that the system didn't work very well. Repeated plays of vinyl dampen the ability to reproduce high frequencies, and it seems that often the spoiler signal was either audible during regular playback, or didn't have sufficient impact upon recordings. Either way, after a few plays it was destined to disappear due to regular wear and tear on the record's groove.
In the end, the best information I found about this 1970s development with vinyl copy-protection was included as incidental information on this Google Answers thread - 'Did Recording Industry Intend Compact Discs (CDs) to Have Copy Protection?'
It seems a shame that the history is not more widely available on the internet.
You see it looks like in the 1970s the music industry tried to stop people copying their content, didn't do it very well, made themselves unpopular with both the consumer and the artists they are meant to represent, and eventually had to recant. What is it they say about those who fail to learn from history?
In Cold Blood ★★★★☆
Truman Capote
Genre(s) | Nonfiction, Crime, Classic
Goodreads Rating | 4.05
Humpo Show Rating | 4.10
Published | 1966
Publisher | Penguin Random House
A fully deserving literary classic
On November 15, 1959, in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, four members of the Clutter family were savagely murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces. There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues. As Truman Capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, he generates both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy. In Cold Blood is a work that transcends its moment, yielding poignant insights into the nature of American violence.
Capote's true crime novel is billed as a literary classic – and having raced through the final two parts, I can confirm that In Cold Blood is fully deserving of the status that has been bestowed upon it. The combination of facts with a writing style more commonly associated with fiction help to create an intelligible book that comprehensively covers all aspects of the case, from beginning to end.
Capote goes over every possible detail, which rather hindered my reading of the story in the early stages given that the main event had not occurred yet. We were introduced to every member of the Clutter family in exquisite detail, particularly head of the household, Herb, and multi-talented and much loved 16-year-old Nancy. This helps to lay the groundwork for when the inevitable happens. He also gives plenty of coverage of the murderers Dick and Perry in the open passages which helps to build their characters, that is expanded upon during their escapades across the U.S. and everywhere else. Without the initial introductions and extensive coverage of their lives and personalities, which I laboured throughout somewhat, we as readers would not react as strongly towards the offenders and the Clutters in such a manner than we would have without the prior knowledge about them all.
The writing style is the abiding memory I will take from my reading of Capote's masterpiece. The murders and the story behind them are fascinating in themselves, but told through Capote's style makes it memorable. In modern times we have become perhaps a little numbed by horrific deaths, murders etc, as we hear the worst of the worst on the news on a daily basis and through TV and film, but the apparently motiveless and brutal murder of the Clutters still has the shock value sixty years on, and for fans of detective and forensic shows, you'll be treated to the police work, investigations and interviews that were compelling and gave fantastic insight into the mindset of a investigating officer's home life.
In Cold Blood is the one nonfiction crime story that you must read should any of you delve into that particular genre. Capote's writing style, the fascinating story concerning all parties, and the way it all comes together helps to make it such an important and brilliantly written story. It truly deserves the classic status attributed to it.

One of only three Osama Bin Laden dolls designed for a CIA 'influence operation' is on sale on a memorabilia auction site. Authored by creator of iconic GI Joe toys they were to be distributed to Middle Eastern children to put them off joining Al-Qaeda.
The prototype dolls were codenamed “Devil Eyes” and were created in 2005 by late Donald Levine - a business executive at Hasbro toy giant and the creator of the GI Joe action figures.
The scary image of then Al-Qaeda chief was meant to discourage kids from joining terror groups.
The CIA however decided not to go ahead with the “influence operation,” and according to the Washington Post, which broke the story in June, two of the evil dolls still belong to the CIA and the Pentagon.
The doll features two heads – the permanent one that Bin Laden's look-alike representations and the removable one that looks like demon with red and black facial features.
The action man is kitted out in traditional Muslim dress with white headband, white tunic and white pants.
One of the dolls has been given to the online catalogue of LA-based memorabilia auctioneers Nate D Sanders and has the starting price of $2,500. Although only one bid is currently listed for the whacky doll, Sanders told the news website Mashable that 90 percent of bids normally come in on the last day of bidding and the Bin Laden miniature's final price is likely to be a lot higher.
Sanders operates a policy of not disclosing how it gets hold of the diverse items it puts up for sale but did say the doll came with a “letter of authenticity”, which had been signed by Levine's son.
Atheists, be ashamed.

No, I'm not annoyed with Sarkeesian: I'm annoyed that the atheist movement has gotten this bad.
Here's a lovely representative response:
@noelplum @pzmyers I'm annoyed that anyone is still asserting the atheist labels implies anything other than a lack of belief in gods. — Miles Grimes (@TheDecentTech) October 17, 2014 I'm annoyed that anyone is still asserting the atheist labels implies anything other than a lack of belief in gods.
Right. ‘The dictionary doesn't say atheists have to be decent human beings, therefore I'm going to be more annoyed that you have this expectation than at the fact that some atheists are hateful numpties.'
Whatever happened to the rational idea that we should look at our failings honestly and strive to correct them? You know, when Francis Bacon set out to tell the world about how science should be done, he didn't just pull a sentence out of a dictionary and be done with it. “Inductive reasoning is best, rah rah rah!” No — he wrote at length about the pitfalls, and spelled out the preconceptions to which we are prone.
The idols and false notions which have already preoccupied the human understanding, and are deeply rooted in it, not only to beset man's minds, that they become difficult of access, but, even when access is obtained, will again meet and trouble us in the instauration of the sciences, unless mankind, when forewarned, guard themselves with all possible care against them.
The idols of the tribe are inherent in human nature, and the very tribe or race of man. For man's sense is falsely asserted to be the standard of things. On the contrary, all the perceptions, both of the senses and the mind, bear reference to man, and not to the universe, and the human mind resembles those uneven mirrors, which impart their own properties to different objects, from which rays are emitted, and distort and disfigure them.
But I guess atheists have moved so far beyond mere scientists that self-awareness and recognition of their own errors of perception no longer matter — “There is no god!” is the great All of their philosophy, and no other consideration need be made.
Well, at least we're better than the theists in one thing: our dogma is shorter and easier to memorize.
Behind the Republican governor's unassuming image is a track record that puts him a big step to the right of what many Americans would consider in the middle
John Kasich has been billed as moderate candidate, but his record is anything but
Moments after he placed second in the New Hampshire primary, John Kasich was transformed from a low-profile, under-the-radar candidate to the new face of compassionate conservatism in America.
Trump and Sanders look south and west as 2016 race heats up – campaign live Read more
Here, apparently, was the moderate Republican antidote to the domineering Donald Trump, a governor with a record of achievement, willing to rise above the fearful invective on immigration to campaign in an optimistic way about the future of the United States.
“If you don't have a seatbelt, go get one,” the 63-year-old almost yelled as he told an enthusiastic meeting of independents and Republican centrists. “Tonight the light overcame the darkness.”
But behind the unassuming image is a track record in his home state of Ohio, where he is a second-term governor, that puts him a big step to the right of what many Americans would consider moderate.
Within hours of his success in New Hampshire, fresh legislation was passed in Ohio that will further restrict access to abortion in a state where Kasich has signed every one of a series of anti-choice measures that has ever reached his desk.
Across the state he has made an enemy of public sector unions, teachers and environmentalists with attacks on collective bargaining, cuts to funding of public schools alongside scandals in the charter school education sector, and enthusiastic support for oil and gas production via fracking – even though that has not brought as much prosperity to the state as some think.
“The people in Ohio who know him are stunned that he has been allowed to get away with calling himself a moderate,” said Sandy Theis, executive director of the liberal thinktank Progress Ohio.
“He is a climate change denier, he has had a scandal in his heavily championed support of charter schools, unemployment has gone down but poverty has risen in the state, we have a terrible infant mortality rate for African American babies – I could go on. Maybe the middle has moved so far to the right that there is no genuine moderate in the Republican race anymore,” she said.
Maybe the middle has moved so far to the right that there is no genuine moderate in the Republican race any more Sandy Theis
Sandwiched in New Hampshire between runaway winner Donald Trump and third-place Tea Party champion Ted Cruz, it is hardly a surprise that Kasich now seeks to capitalize on the mainstream appeal that charmed voters at more than 100 town hall meetings across the state.
In a Republican field where candidates are competing in tough-guy rhetoric on bombing Islamic State, building impregnable borders and barring Muslims from entering the country, Kasich's record on many key issues is more moderate and nuanced than many of his competitors – which actually puts him at risk of being unable to attract the conservative voters as the race goes on.
Kasich does not believe in deporting illegal immigrants, providing they have been law-abiding since arriving in the US, and said Trump's idea to ban Muslims from America would weaken the US and “is not what we are”.
And he accepted extra Medicaid dollars from the federal government distributed under the Affordable Care Act, even though he has since boasted he would “repeal Obamacare” if he reaches the White House.
Kasich fell out with the Koch brothers, rightwing mega-donors, over pointed comments he made at a fundraising event about how people needed to be accountable for what they had done for the poor when they “get to the pearly gates”.
And he consistently talks about getting things done, fixing problems and working together being more important than party politics.
He has strongly opposed same-sex marriage but said he accepted the supreme court's decision last summer that made it legal across all states and said it was time for the country to accept that reality and “move on”.
And Kasich has acknowledged climate change – although he maintains he does not know if the actions of humankind are driving it, and he does not support action to curb emissions by regulating traditional energy producers.
“I've known him for many years and in that time American politics has evolved to the point where labels like moderate no longer apply in the way they did some years ago,” said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's center for politics.
“If you had asked me in the 90s about Kasich I would have said he was a Gingrich conservative,” Sabato said. “But even then, when Newt Gingrich was House speaker during Bill Clinton's presidency, there were fights but they also got some things done,” he added.
Kasich was a congressman in Washington, representing Ohio, from 1983 to 2001, and worked his way up to become head of the budget committee, where he was known for reaching across the aisle to help deliver a rare, balanced budget.
After leaving Congress he became a powerful executive at Lehman Brothers, the investment bank that spectacularly collapsed under the weight of the debt it had risked as it helped to precipitate the financial collapse in 2008.
“That's not a great thing to have on your resume, and he hasn't really been challenged on that yet,” Sabato said.
He was voted in as governor of Ohio in 2010. As a state that is regarded as one of the most “purple” and strategically important swing states, Ohio twice chose Barack Obama and remains a state where “you won't get elected if you are not a pragmatist”, according to Sabato.
Sabato predicted Kasich will not do well in the next contests in South Carolina or Nevada. If he can hang on through Super Tuesday on 1 March and win the primaries in Michigan and his own crucial state of Ohio later that month, however, he has his best shot of becoming a power broker in, he would hope, a contested Republican National Convention.
That could put him in a strong position to land the vice-presidential spot, which could be seen as the best possible outcome for his campaign.
The alternative scenario is that he fizzles out after his big push in New Hampshire and goes out with the label of flash in the pan. “That's the alpha and the omega of the Kasich campaign,” Sabato said.
Between his own campaign and his Super Pac he has access to a documented $4.5m and his war chest has received a further $4m in donations since January, yet to be declared in the monthly public filings, via the political action committee.
“He clearly has a message that is resonating, and it's resonated in Ohio for the last however many years he has been in office as governor. His message of positivity and as someone who gets things accomplished is powerful, and his is not interested in political parties, he's interested in solving problems,” said a spokesperson, Emmalee Kalmbach.
But Kasich's record on reproductive rights in Ohio is anything but moderate – he had signed 16 pieces of legislation into law that have severely restricted the availability of abortion services in the state.
The state government's latest piece of legislation that passed on Wednesday takes vital funding away from Planned Parenthood.
“Under Governor Kasich, Ohio has passed 17 restrictions on women's health, closing nearly half the abortion providers in the state,” Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, said on Wednesday after the Ohio legislature sent the latest bill to Kasich, who has 10 days to sign it.
Kasich appears to be strongly influenced by his religion and often talks about God and his personal beliefs while on the campaign trail.
He was brought up as a devout Catholic but has talked of drifting away from his faith in late youth, only to move strongly back after suffering an appalling personal tragedy.
His parents were killed by a drunken driver when Kasich was in his mid-30s, and he has talked of it profoundly changing his attitude to life, after he struggled through the initial bereavement.
It made him more empathetic, he has said, but also generated fresh religious faith in him and he joined a conservative, breakaway branch of the Anglican church in Ohio.
Ironically, this weakens his appeal both to evangelicals and progressive, moderate Christians. On the economic front, voters in Ohio overturned his attempt to restrict collective bargaining for public sector workers in 2011. Moderates may have welcomed his boost to Medicaid, but Theis, the executive director of Progress Ohio, accused him of undermining that move by vigorously cutting taxes.
“John Kasich is nowhere near as likable or as moderate as he makes out, and I think it won't take long for that to become apparent in this campaign. He's a flash in the pan,” Theis said.
Despite all the hacks and other issues encountered with his popular Linux Mint project in the last few months, Clement Lefebvre has had the time to update the awesome Cinnamon desktop environment.
Cinnamon 2.8.7 has been introduced for the Linux Mint 17.3 "Rosa" operating system, which is the latest stable release of the Ubuntu-based GNU/Linux distribution, and it brings quite some changes when compared with the previous maintenance build.
Looking at the changelog, which we've attached at the end of the article for reference, we can notice mostly bugfixes, such as patches for issues with event handlers for teaching keybindings and with Menu Applet's vfade in the program list.
"It was only showing when desktop zoom was turned entirely off. We've reworked zoom since then so that the .applications key only determines whether we listen to key and mouse bindings or not," said Michael Webster, one of the Cinnamon devs.
Moreover, the built-in magnifier now features the ability to limit the maximum zoom to a decent value, the screensaver's proxy now correctly listens to the right service, and several issues of the layout have been resolved.
Cinnamon 2.8.7 now available for Linux Mint users
In addition to the changes mentioned above, Cinnamon 2.8.7 also addresses various problems with the Windows List applet, the layout.js, util.js, and signalManager.js files, as well as with cs_backgrounds:.
The D-Bus methods for screen capture have been fixed as well. Please consult the changelog below for all the tech-savvy details, and don't forget to update your Linux Mint 17.3 "Rosa" operating system to Cinnamon 2.8.7 as soon as possible.

The young Florida man who was arrested after posing as an Australian jihadist was a key player in a large number of online controversies, including the smear campaign against an American black activist who was publicly accused of lying about his race.
Joshua Goldberg, 20, who had been calling for terror attacks in western countries under the guise of jihadist "Australi Witness", was also at the centre of the woman-hating campaigns known as "Gamergate" and a behind a blog called "Philosophy of Rape" on which he wrote that "whores and feminazis need to be put in their place through rape".
"Fake jihadi" Joshua Goldberg had numerous online alter egos, allegedly including the Twitter handle AustraliWitness.
On online forums Reddit and 4chan, under the name European88, he uploaded thousands of anti-semitic and racist posts as a neo-Nazi, and on the specialty neo-Nazi site Daily Stormer, he his alter-ego Michael Slay did the same.
After his arrest on terrorism offences on Friday, followed by an investigation and tip-off to police by Fairfax Media, Daily Stormer disavowed him, with site administrator Andrew Anglin writing: "Wacko Jew Terrorist Joshua Goldberg Attempted to Infiltrate the Daily Stormer".
Victor Dzantemirovich Zangiev (Russian: Виктор Дзантемирович Зангиев, Ossetian: Зæнджиаты Дзантемиры фырт Виктор; born May 26, 1962) is a retired Soviet and Russian amateur and professional wrestler of Ossetian origin, who wrestled professionally in Japan.
Amateur wrestling career [ edit ]
Victor Zangiev was an amateur wrestler from the Soviet Union. In 1981, he reversed the first seat in the 100 kg class for the Junior World Championships in freestyle wrestling. In 1985, he won two major amateur wrestling titles, the U.S.-Soviet Cup Championships and the World Cup Championships. In 1988, Zangiev won the Soviet Championships.
Professional wrestling career [ edit ]
New Japan Pro Wrestling (1989–1990) [ edit ]
In 1989, Zangiev, along with several other amateurs, were invited by Antonio Inoki to train in his dojo and wrestle professionally in his promotion, New Japan Pro Wrestling. Debuting on February 22 at Sumo Hall, Zangiev wrestled two exhibition matches, first against Salman Hashimikov (which ended in a time-limit draw), then against Osamu Matsuda, whom he defeated. In April 1989, he participated in a tournament to determine the new IWGP Heavyweight Champion at New Japan's first show at the Tokyo Dome; he defeated Buzz Sawyer in the quarterfinals, but lost to Shinya Hashimoto in the semifinals. Zangiev would continue wrestling in the mid-card, before leaving at the tail end of 1990.
Before their departure, he and Hashimikov were chosen to represent the Soviet Union for the Pat O'Connor International Tag Team Tournament at Starrcade '90: Collision Course for World Championship Wrestling; they defeated the Canadian team of Danny Johnson and Troy Montour in the quarterfinals, but lost to Masa Saito and The Great Muta in the semifinals.
UWF International (1994) [ edit ]
In April 1994, Zangiev returned to Japan, this time with the shoot-style UWF International. Like in NJPW, he didn't compete for championships, he mainly wrestled in mid-card single and tag team matches. In October 1994, he left UWFi and retired from professional wrestling.

HOUSTON — A small meeting of a group seeking tougher gun laws was interrupted Saturday at a suburban Dallas restaurant when the woman who helped organize it saw something outside that startled her: at least two dozen men and women in the parking lot with shotguns, hunting rifles, AR-15s and AK-47s.
The scene unfolded near AT&T Stadium in the suburb of Arlington about 30 minutes after three women associated with the local chapter of Moms Demands Action for Gun Sense in America met inside the Blue Mesa Grill.
“I was terrified,” said the woman who helped coordinate the meeting and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she said she feared for her safety. “They didn't want to talk. They wanted to display force.”
Image Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America provided a picture of Open Carry Texas members photographed Saturday from inside a Dallas-area restaurant. The gun-rights group was protesting the other group's campaign.
The armed group of men, women and children was made up of members of a gun rights organization called Open Carry Texas, and they stayed in the parking lot about 10 or 15 minutes to protest the Moms Demand Action meeting and then left.
"Raw Politics" on "Anderson Cooper 360" delivers the latest political news with a wry sense of a humor and without spin.
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- For decades, evangelicals have been seen as solid supporters of the Republican Party. That could be changing.
The religious right, a cornerstone of the so-called Reagan revolution -- the battle over abortion law, and gay marriage -- wants a change.
At least some evangelicals do.
A group of influential Christian leaders are declaring they are tired of divisive politics, tired of watching fights over some issues trump all the good they could be doing.
"Our proposal in [our] manifesto is to join forces with all those who support a civil public square. ... a vision of public life in which people of all faiths -- which, of course, means no faith -- are free to enter and engage public life on the basis of their faith," said evangelical leader Os Guinness.
For Democrats, the timing is good. The party has been pushing to overcome the "faith gap," that many feels has hurt them with church-going voters.
Candidates are appearing in more religious settings, and conversations.
"What I try to do is as best I can be an instrument of His will," Sen. Barack Obama has said.
"I obviously was fortunate to be able to rely on and be grounded in my faith which has been anchor for me throughout my entire life," Sen. Hillary Clinton has said.
Mara Vanderslice of Common Good Strategies is part of that effort.
"I think the biggest thing that we've done wrong is sort of say that we just want a separation of church and state and only speak about religion in terms of separation," Vanderslice said.
Evangelicals are now leading public support for many issues dear to Democrats: global campaigns against AIDS, hunger and poverty. Watch how evangelicals are reaching out »
Even Congressional Democrats can see the power of a partnership, according to the Ethics and Public Policy Center's Michael Cromartie.
"I think there are genuinely religious people, obviously in the Democratic Party, who've said, you know, 'we need to stop toning down how our faith relates to public policy issues,' whether it's the environment or whether it's questions of the economy or war and peace," he said.
"And we need to start framing our concerns in religious language so that it might appeal to religious believers in America."
Some staunchly conservative evangelicals are critical of the new approach. They are proud of the gains they have made through ties to conservative Republicans.
And if Democrats want a share of their support, some political analysts say the Democrats will have to give something in return -- a hotly-debated issue like abortion.

Huma Abedin
Michele Bachmann has every right to ask questions.
Despite mounting evidence of close ties between the Muslim Brotherhood and Huma Abedin, Secretary of State Clinton's close aide, Republican congressional leaders — particularly Senator John McCain and House Speaker John Boehner — continue to target their ire not at the State Department but at Representative Michele Bachmann.
Representative Bachmann is one of five House conservatives who have raised concerns about Muslim Brotherhood infiltration of our government. Glenn Beck reported Tuesday that GOP leadership is trying to extort an apology out of Bachmann by threatening to boot her from the House Intelligence Committee if she fails to submit.

That got me to wondering: Any chance Speaker Boehner might take just a couple of minutes out of his busy jihad against Bachmann to focus on how the State Department — during Ms. Abedin's tenure — has cozied up to Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, the Muslim Brotherhood's chief sharia jurist?
Sheikh Qaradawi is a promoter of jihadist terror. His fatwas endorse terrorist attacks against American personnel in Iraq as well as suicide bombing — by both men and women — against Israel. He is a leading supporter of Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood's Palestinian branch. He also runs an umbrella organization called the Union for Good (sometimes referred to as the “Union of Good”), which is formally designated a terrorist organization under American law. The Union for Good was behind the “Peace Flotilla” that attempted to break our ally Israel's blockade of the terrorist organization Hamas (the Muslim Brotherhood's Palestinian branch) in 2010.
That's rather interesting — at least to me, though apparently not to Speaker Boehner — because Huma Abedin's mother, Saleha, who is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood's female division (the “Muslim Sisterhood”), is a major figure in not one but two Union for Good components. The first is the International Islamic Council for Dawa and Relief (IICDR). It is banned in Israel for supporting Hamas under the auspices of the Union for Good. Then there's the International Islamic Committee for Woman and Child (IICWC) — an organization that Dr. Saleha Abedin has long headed. Dr. Abedin's IICWC describes itself as part of the IICDR. And wouldn't you know it, the IICWC charter was written by none other than . . . Sheikh Qaradawi, in conjunction with several self-proclaimed members of the Muslim Brotherhood.

#page#In McCainWorld, these are what are known as “a few unspecified and unsubstantiated associations.” But I digress. Clearly, these significant Muslim Brotherhood connections are of scant interest to Speaker Boehner, who has decided the problem is not the Brotherhood connections but the people who are shedding light on the Brotherhood connections. Nevertheless, since Boehner purports to be all about cracking down on wasteful government spending, at least when he's not signing off on deals to extend President Obama's credit card by another trillion or three, I thought I might ask whether the State Department's Fulbright Scholar Program aroused his curiosity ever so slightly.
Fulbright, by its own account, is “the government's flagship program in international educational exchange,” promoting “mutual understanding” between the U.S. and other countries. In the 2010–2011 academic year — the year of the Union for Good's “Freedom Flotilla,” if you need a time marker — one Fulbright scholarship was awarded to a lucky chemistry student from Qatar. Her name is Siham al-Qaradawi, and she just happens to be the daughter of Sheikh Qaradawi.

Now, besides despising America and having lots of global academic connections (at least in countries where he's not banned), the sheikh happens to be a very wealthy man — the sharia-advisory business can be very profitable. And while the sheikh's daughter is said to be an exceptional chemist, the world is full of exceptional chemists. How is it that Qaradawi's daughter gets the State Department prize? I'm just wondering, and wondering if Speaker Boehner is wondering.

Oh, one last thing. Obviously, Huma Abedin does not make Obama-administration or State Department policy. Policy is made by President Obama and Secretary Clinton, and they hardly needed Ms. Abedin in order to have pro-Islamist leanings.
Nevertheless, since Secretary Clinton's tenure began, with Huma Abedin serving as a top adviser, the United States has aligned itself with the Muslim Brotherhood in myriad ways. To name just a few (the list is by no means exhaustive): Our government reversed the policy against formal contacts with the Brotherhood; funded Hamas; continued funding Egypt even after the Brotherhood won the elections; dropped an investigation of Brotherhood organizations in the U.S. that were previously identified as co-conspirators in the case of the Holy Land Foundation financing Hamas; hosted Brotherhood delegations in the United States; issued a visa to a member of the Islamic Group (a designated terrorist organization) and hosted him in Washington because he is part of the Brotherhood's parliamentary coalition in Egypt; announced that Israel should go back to its indefensible 1967 borders; excluded Israel, the world's leading target of terrorism, from a counterterrorism forum in which the State Department sought to “partner” with Islamist governments that do not regard attacks on Israel as terrorism; and pressured Egypt's pro-American military government to surrender power to the anti-American Muslim Brotherhood parliament and president just elected by Egypt's predominantly anti-American population.

So I was hoping maybe the speaker could explain to us: Hypothetically, if Huma Abedin did have a bias in favor of the Muslim Brotherhood, and if she were actually acting on that bias to try to tilt American policy in favor of the Muslim Brotherhood, what exactly would the State Department be doing differently?

Donald Trump and his campaign are signaling a shift toward an election strategy laid out by conspiracy theorist, dirty trickster, and informal Trump adviser Roger Stone.
For months, Stone has pushed for Trump to invoke the Clintons' supposed “war on women,” and both the candidate and campaign staffers have been making the rounds this week indicating that they plan to do so.
Stone heads a pro-Trump super PAC and previously served as a paid consultant to Trump's campaign. He has been a key promoter of Trump's candidacy in the media, particularly on the radio and internet program of 9/11 conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
Stone himself is an ardent conspiracy theorist. He recently floated the theory that the Clintons had four people murdered over the summer, which dovetails with his previously stated claim that the couple is “plausibly responsible” for the deaths of roughly 40 people. Stone has also alleged that the Bush family “tried to kill” President Ronald Reagan, that President Lyndon Johnson was behind the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and that the father of Senator Ted Cruz was involved in the killing as well – a theory that was pushed by Donald Trump.
Stone said he had doubts that Clinton would have the stamina to do an entire 90-minute debate and claimed she was wearing an earpiece during NBC's candidate forum because she “clearly has no memory.” He also claimed Clinton was placed on an oxygen tank immediately after the recent presidential debate and “has some advanced form of epilepsy.”
Former Trump adviser Michael Caputo, guest hosting on the September 25 edition of WBEN's Hardline, said he “heard more than one time Donald Trump say” that Stone's book The Clintons' War on Women “is his opposition research on the Clintons.” He added that Trump “has it on his desk.”
The book, co-authored by fellow conspiracy theorist Robert Morrow, describes itself as a guide to “how Bill and Hillary Clinton systematically abused women and others -- sexually, physically, and psychologically -- in their scramble for power and wealth.”
Morrow is also a discredited researcher. He has a history of bizarre sexual writings about Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family. Morrow also relishes tweeting the slur “nigger” and was ousted as the chair of the Travis County, TX, Republican Party by “party officials who found him a perpetual embarrassment.”
Previously, Trump has promoted Morrow and Stone's book on his Twitter account. In January, after claiming that Bill Clinton was “one of the great woman abusers of all time," Trump cited Stone's book for his claim that Hillary Clinton "went after the women very, very strongly and very viciously, according to the women and according to other sources."
Following his poorly received performance in Monday night's debate, Trump appears ready to again follow Stone's advice. Politico reported that “threats emanated from Trump Tower on Tuesday that the Republican nominee was preparing to name-check Bill Clinton's mistresses — alleged or otherwise.”
Immediately after the debate, Trump told the media, “I'm really happy I was able to hold back on the indiscretions in respect to Bill Clinton. Because I have a lot of respect for Chelsea Clinton.” He added, “Maybe I'll tell you at the next debate. We'll see. But I'm very happy.”
Top Trump campaign surrogate and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said, “The president of the United States, her husband, disgraced this country with what he did in the Oval Office and she didn't just stand by him, she attacked Monica Lewinsky. And after being married to Bill Clinton for 20 years, if you didn't know the moment Monica Lewinsky said that Bill Clinton violated her that she was telling the truth, then you're too stupid to be president.”
Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie appeared on Fox & Friends and said, “I think that if you look at Hillary Clinton's background and if you look at her being an enabler, really, in the '90s and really attacking these women, it goes against everything that she now tries to spout as a candidate for president.”
Eric Trump, the nominee's son, lauded his father's “courage” for not bringing up Lewinsky during the debate during a radio appearance.
The Stone-influenced strategy comes at the same time the Trump campaign is also reportedly receiving advice from Fox News founder and former chairman Roger Ailes, who was ousted from the network after former anchor Gretchen Carlson accused him of sexual harassment and sued him. Soon after, at least 25 women came forward, making very similar allegations about Ailes' behavior over multiple decades. Recent reports indicate that after the debate debacle, Ailes' role with the Trump campaign may be expanded.
VR is hot!
But is it permanent?
Those of us who are old enough to have seen the rise of virtual reality in the ‘90s and then the fall and then another rise in mid 2000 and then another fall, know that the present hype about virtual reality may not be sustainable.
That said, we have also seen in the past that for some technologies, after several cycles of hype, the innovation finally does become mainstream. One example is personal organizers (mobile calendar and contacts apps) on a portable device. Palm OS and PDAs rose in 1996 and fell a few years later, and then Pocket PC and Windows CE rose in early 2000 and fell. It wasn't until the emergence of iPhones and Android smartphones that those applications became sustainable.
So the big question is: Is VR here to stay this time, or is it hype?
To find the answer, my firm has been researching the VR market for the past few months. We evaluated and estimated product sales for over 30 companies and 40 products globally through revenues and units sold/used for each of the vendors. Here are some of our findings:
1. In 2016, hardware makers dominate the VR market. Sony (PSVR) is clearly leading and is taking one third of the whole market. This is thanks to a) the large installed base of about 40-50 million Playstations sold to users who are the perfect target for a VR upgrade and b) the best balance of price/performance for the VR headset around the $300-$400 price point.
2. Sony is followed by Facebook (the Oculus platform) and Google (Daydream, Card Board, Tilt Brush, etc.); neither company has a VR user base anywhere close to Sony's, and their products are either at the low end or a bit too expensive. Still, both companies are generating hundreds of millions of dollars already in 2016, thanks to their brand and the quality of their technology.
3. Samsung follows with another mobile headset (Gear VR). And HTC is close behind with its high-end headset, Vive, thanks to its partnership with Valve and the very popular Steam platform.
4. Content providers, mostly game makers, as well as technology providers come next. This has to change in the coming years (and hopefully will change) since that's where the bigger value resides. But it is normal to see hardware makers emerge first: Hardware vendors had to ship their kits to developers. Now that there are enough headsets out there in users' hands (or rather on their heads), it's time to accelerate generation of content (games, mobile apps, desktop applications, etc). The result of this effort will be more VR games and applications in the coming months and years.
5. Towards the bottom of the top 20 list, we also see vendors positioned in the “VR for work” segment, with VR applications in collaboration, education, industry, military and defense, science and medical, and other research fields.
So what are your thoughts? VR or VRn't?

Pacers president Larry Bird tells reporters his relationship with former Celtics teammate Kevin McHale is too important to him to consider McHale to be the next Pacers' coach. (0:23)
Give Larry Bird this: He's transparent and consistent. He has long argued that coaches grow stale, and he fired himself after three seasons as the Pacers' coach -- ending in a loss to the Lakers in the 2000 Finals.
A year ago, he announced to the world that he didn't really want Roy Hibbert on his team anymore. The league was trending small, and Bird was going to drag Indiana into the cool kids clique -- even if he didn't end up giving coach Frank Vogel the right players to make that happen.
Last week he told The Indianapolis Star he wasn't sure about Vogel's future but didn't want to leave him hanging -- even after a fit of coaching musical chairs left only New York, Houston and Sacramento with openings. Two of those aren't exactly atop anyone's "Most Appealing Jobs" list.
And so today, Vogel is somehow out of the job he held for five-plus seasons. The Pacers won 58 percent of their games under Vogel, made the playoffs every year but the season after Paul George's horrific leg injury and pushed Miami to the brink in back-to-back conference finals.
There is a weird dissonance swirling around coaching tenures. Bird and others talk about how players naturally start tuning out coaches if they stay too long -- the Scott Skiles effect. That's probably true in some cases, though only three players -- George, Ian Mahinmi, and George Hill -- remain from the 2012-13 team that took Miami the distance before burping away the series with a heap of embarrassing turnovers. Those are important players, but they are only three. Vogel also doesn't seem like a coach who would lose the room. Players like him and he's relentlessly positive.
But some of the same people who wring their hands about the Skiles effect talk from the other side of their mouths about the importance of continuity, especially as player contracts get shorter. Oh, what we would give for what Gregg Popovich, Rick Carlisle, and Erik Spoelstra have been empowered to build! Backing coaches through the ups and downs sends a message of organizational coherence: We don't overreact to short-term blips, and the players don't run the show.
Everyone pays lip service to striving for that sort of stability -- everyone but Bird, apparently. The Pacers had a chance to evolve and grow with a young, dynamic coach, and they've punted it to hire a new voice.
Vogel was never the most adaptable coach, but that lack of adaptability birthed an identity: smashmouth basketball. The Pacers played big, with David West and Hibbert, and smothered teams with long-armed defense at every position. When teams like the Heat and Knicks went small against Indiana, the Pacers stuck to their guns. It mostly worked. It got them further than their talent level suggested they should have gotten.
Hibbert for a brief time unnerved LeBron James at the rim. It was fashionable to dismiss those Pacers as the overhyped product of a watered-down Eastern Conference, but they generally played well against the West and gave the Heat all they could handle. Hibbert has lost his way since leaving the Pacers. So has Lance Stephenson. Does Vogel get any credit for bringing out the best in them and for using Stephenson as a holdover starter running point on second units? What about the complete transformation of Mahinmi from rock-handed bozo to viable pick-and-roll dive man?
Vogel didn't reach everyone -- Evan Turner and Gerald Green bombed in Indy -- but the big names who left haven't looked the same. Among those big names: West, who lit $11 million on fire to ditch Indiana and let everyone know on the way out that he didn't appreciate Bird throwing Hibbert under the bus.
Bird wants to play smaller and faster, with more pass-pass-pass continuity. The path there, in his view, is clear: Dan Burke, longtime Pacers defensive coordinator, can maintain an elite defense, while some scoring guru can replace Vogel and reinvent the Pacers on the other end. That could well happen, but Vogel has done enough that Bird should at least have looked at another solution: Keep Vogel and pluck an offensive-minded assistant to help the Pacers evolve. Vogel is only 42. He's going to get better at this.
And it's not as if Vogel was some dunderhead about offense. He made real adjustments. The Heat credited Indiana for being the first team to figure out Miami's blitzing defense by having West slip picks, snag easy passes and survey the floor in a four-on-three:
"They used our aggressiveness against us," Shane Battier told me during the 2014 conference finals. "They were the first team to really do that."
Vogel used Hibbert in the pick-and-roll much more against Miami, knowing that if the big fella could just catch the ball in space, he would have only a little guy to finish over. They found creative ways around Miami's fronting post defense, though they could never sustain them over full series. On the other end, he gradually changed the way West guarded the pick-and-roll and saved the Pacers' teetering 2014 season in the first round by switching more against Atlanta's shooters.
But in the big picture, Bird's right: The Pacers, and Vogel, have long needed a boost on offense. They were the worst offensive team in the league, non-Sixers division, over the last few months of 2014, as their dream season imploded. At times it seemed as if they had no understanding of spacing; Stephenson and George would chill 2 feet inside the 3-point arc, instead of sliding behind it, allowing their defenders to clog driving lanes.
Too many possessions died after one action -- or even none:
The Pacers were habitually slow making the extra pass, allowing scrambled defenses to recover and blanket them. There were times against Atlanta and Miami in the playoffs when they appeared to forget how to pass and catch basketballs. They had trouble in close games, especially this season.
Some of this was on the players. Having two post-up brutes will clog any lane. And it's not as if Vogel and his staff weren't on Stephenson, George and Hill to space the floor properly and cut more. Players can be hard to change. Ask Scott Brooks and Billy Donovan.
But some of it has to fall on the coach, too. Vogel never ran the most inventive stuff, and his rotations were inflexible. He might have lost his job in Game 5 of Indiana's first-round loss to the Raptors, when the Pacers entered the fourth quarter up by 13, trotted out the same helpless bench-heavy unit that hemorrhaged points in the second quarter and watched that unit vomit up half their lead in two minutes.
That was an astonishing misstep from a really good coach. That lineup actually expanded Indy's lead in the prior game, and when that minor miracle happens, the Pacers generally win. But it's a long shot, something I've harped on all season (see point No. 10), and Vogel should have mothballed it after watching it poop the bed in the second quarter of Game 5.
When a front office is on the fence about a coach, one bad decision can tip it toward a firing. Monty Williams might still be the head guy in New Orleans today had the Pelicans not choked away a giant lead in Game 3 of their first-round series against the Warriors last season amid a haze of confusion and awful choices. Vogel will always wonder about that night in Toronto.
But if Bird wanted to transform the Pacers into some small-ball machine, he needed to give Vogel better players. If he really expected this Indy roster to win more than 45 games, maybe he should have tried coaching it next season.
To play smaller, the Pacers added Monta Ellis, C.J. Miles and Chase Budinger, who was a player Bird had long coveted, per several league sources. Turns out Budinger can't really play anymore after a bunch of knee surgeries everyone knew about. Ellis was coming off knee surgery and never found his comfort zone on offense in his first year as a Pacer. He remains laughably bad on defense; Burke and Vogel deserve a ton of credit for the Pacers finishing third in points allowed per possession while giving heavy minutes to Ellis, Miles and a rookie big man, Myles Turner, learning NBA defense as a teenager.
Indiana started the year with Miles as the nominal power forward. On those nights when Miles made a million crazy 3s, it looked great; the Pacers could spread the floor, and Miles battled post-up brutes so that George could envelope top wing scorers.
Only, it didn't work. Opponents outscored that lineup by almost seven points per 100 possessions, a disastrous margin. Indiana won early-season games mostly because of George's brilliance, Hill's shooting and the work Mahinmi, Turner, Lavoy Allen and Jordan Hill did when any two of them shared the floor in traditional lineups.
If given more time, those Miles-centric small-ball groups might have worked. They looked promising, but Miles battled through several injuries, lost his shooting touch and became a liability on defense at any position.
Indiana had no backup point guard. The rest of their small-ball options -- Rodney Stuckey and Solomon Hill -- were nonshooters who couldn't spread the floor. Even Turner, the player for whom Bird pined as he rode the pine, never developed into a real floor-spacer. He made three 3s all season and spent most of his time either in the dunker spot along the baseline or popping midrange jumpers.
The Pacers were one shooter short of being a dynamic small-ball team. Going small with poor shooting brings all the deficits of downsizing and none of the advantages. It just makes teams smaller. Maybe they'll find that shooter this offseason. Maybe it's a healthy Miles. Maybe it's Solomon Hill after his postseason hot streak, though even then, he spent a lot of time hanging around the elbows.
A lot of Bird's fretting, and the major questions about Indiana's future, revolve around Turner. The Pacers could be a deadly small-ish team with Turner at center; Jonas Valanciunas struggled to chase him around the perimeter on the pick-and-roll, and having a legit shooter at center would open the paint for a wing like Solomon Hill or Ellis.
Turner is exploding with talent, but he's plainly not ready to anchor a defense. The Raptors exposed his shaky footwork in the first round, juking him off-balance as ball handlers blew by him. That's why a partnership between Turner and Mahinmi makes more sense in the short term; Mahinmi is a shot-blocking menace -- Smothered chicken! -- who can slice to the basket on offense while Turner spaces the floor.
But Turner just turned 20, and he's not quite a floor-spacer yet. That combo is a year or two away from really jelling. Unfortunately for the Pacers, Mahinmi is a free agent in July, putting them in the awkward position of having to decide now whether Turner is ready for starting center duty.
Indiana acquired Mahinmi for Darren Collison in a 2012 trade a lot of folks pilloried. It worked out fine. A lot of Bird's moves have worked out nicely. He killed the draft, snagging George, Hibbert, and Stephenson at slots that turned out to be low for their talent. If Turner has solved his running gait issues, he's another great pick.
The Pacers also could have Kawhi Leonard right now instead of George Hill. It's a little unfair to hammer them for that deal. George Hill has been really good for Indiana on a value contract, and if the league knew in 2011 Leonard would be even 70 percent as good as he is, he would never have slipped to No. 15. The Spurs and Pacers had also entered into an informal agreement that if the player San Antonio was targeting -- Leonard -- fell to Indiana at No. 15, the teams would swap. But Indiana team officials have told me they had Leonard around No. 5 on their own draft board and that when he fell all the way to No. 15, they thought about scrapping the Spurs deal and just keeping him. Oh well.
Bird flipped Gerald Green, Miles Plumlee and a first-round pick for Luis Scola, knowing Scola would only play backup minutes on the downslope of his career. Scola is a beloved teammate, but that trade is a net loss -- and was likely to be one from day one.
Bird's record is mixed, just as it is for any front-office chief. But if Bird wanted Vogel to play some hyper-passing small-ball system this season, he didn't give him the right ingredients to do it.
Bird is well within his rights to ditch a successful coach in hopes of finding one who better fits his vision and perhaps the team's changing identity. It worked in Golden State, and perhaps in Memphis, and it might be working now in Cleveland. Let's see who Bird hires.
One thing's for sure: He fired a good young coach with room to grow for reasons that aren't precisely clear. Vogel will resurface, and the Rockets, who interviewed him in 2011, need to contact him immediately.
The coaching business is cruel. We all know that. Vogel will get a chance to prove himself in a new spot. It's time for Bird to prove his chops again now.

I'll be very interested to hear whether Burnett's deal includes a no-trade clause. I will assume that it does because of how important it is for him to play near his Maryland home. How that no-trade clause is structured is important because if the Phillies live down to our expectations for them this year, Burnett could become an extremely valuable trade chip come July, or even earlier. I've written before that it makes long-term sense to eat money if it means landing a blue-chip prospect, and the Phillies may have positioned themselves to do so. Of course, if Burnett turns back into the pitcher he was in his final years with the Yankees, the situation becomes lose-lose. But I think the odds say that as long as he stays in the National League and stays healthy, he should be, at the very least, a capable No. 3 starter.
Although the absolute differences in size of the frontal cortex between humans and other primates were large, the frontal cortex in humans and great apes occupied a similar proportion of the cortex of the cerebral hemispheres. The range of relative values did overlap in the different hominoid species. The smaller primates (gibbons and monkeys) had a smaller percentage of their total cortex occupied by frontal cortices, and the range of their values did not overlap with that of the larger hominoids. In relation to overall brain size, the human frontal cortex was as large as expected for a primate brain of human size.
As noted, with respect to the subsectors of the frontal lobe, any definitive statements can only come from comparative cytoarchitectonic studies of the brains of extant ape species and humans, which would be so costly as to preclude their being carried out anytime soon. Therefore, our finding that the two subsectors of the frontal cortex (cortex of the precentral gyrus and cortex rostral to the precentral sulcus) are not disproportionately larger in humans, though provisional, should prove useful until more definitive data become available.
How can we account for the discrepancy between earlier findings (Table 1) and ours? Sample size is the most likely factor. Previous studies have had sample sizes of only one or two hemispheres per species and only one or two of the ape species have been included7,8. Brodmann7 reports a 6% increase in the 'total frontal lobe surface' of the human brain compared to the chimpanzee brain. In our sample, we could find a comparable difference, but only when selected humans and chimpanzees were compared (for example, human 2 versus chimpanzee 4 in Fig. 3). Removal of some of the 'high-end' great ape subjects or of the 'lower-end' human subjects in our study would have yielded results similar to those reported earlier. The inclusion of only selected primate species and an underrepresentation of the great apes are other possible reasons for the discrepant results. Even using our larger sample, if the comparison had been restricted to humans and smaller primates (Fig. 3) and had excluded most of the great apes, the results would have been more consonant with the older results, because gibbons and monkeys do, in fact, have a relatively smaller frontal cortex than humans. In addition, we calculated volumes of the cortical regions of interest, while earlier studies7,8 rely on surface estimates. We doubt that this could account for most of the variance, however, given that the cortical volume is highly correlated with the surface of the cortical sheet. Finally, earlier studies use postmortem specimens as opposed to the living subjects included here, which leaves open the possibility that differential shrinkage could have affected the results.

An issue that needs further investigation is the size of the prefrontal cortex proper (after exclusion of motor, premotor and limbic cortices). We do not think that this can be addressed by gross anatomical studies. No sulcal landmarks can be used reliably to establish the transition of prefrontal cortex to premotor cortex or the borders of individual cortical areas, and thus this issue can only be resolved on the basis of quantitative cytoarchitectonic studies. Recent reports of such studies suggest that the size and organization of individual cortical areas in the hominoid prefrontal cortex may set humans apart from the great apes. Specifically, in terms of size, Brodmann's area 10 is reported to be relatively larger in the human brain14 when compared to the ape brain, while Brodmann's area 13 is smaller15. In the present study, we excluded the cortex of the precentral gyrus from the total frontal cortex in order to examine a subsector of the frontal cortex that includes all of the prefrontal cortices. Brodmann's area 6 and some limbic frontal cortices on the mesial surface were also included, however. We found that this region is as large as expected for an ape brain of human size, and that the relative values among individual humans and individual great apes (but not lesser apes or monkeys) overlapped. This result goes against the large relative differences in the prefrontal cortex between humans and great apes reported in previous publications (Brodmann7, who reports as much as a 12% enlargement in relation to the chimpanzee, and Deacon6, who sets it at 202% more than expected for a brain of the human size), even presuming the possibility of a much smaller premotor and limbic sector.
The fact that the relative size of the frontal cortex is similar in humans and great apes does not mean that the frontal cortices are less significant to hominid cognitive specialization than has been suggested1,3,16. The frontal cortices could support the outstanding cognitive capabilities of humans without undergoing a disproportionate overall increase in size. This region may have undergone a reorganization that includes enlargement of selected, but not all, cortical areas to the detriment of others. The same neural circuits might be more richly interconnected within the frontal sectors themselves and between those sectors and other brain regions. Also, subsectors of the frontal lobe might have undergone a modification of local circuitry, expressed, for instance, in the form of distinct cytoarchitectonic patterns. In addition, microscopic or macroscopic subsectors might have been added to the mix or dropped.
There is already some evidence bearing on these possibilities. Findings from the comparative histological studies of the frontal cortex discussed above14,15 and from other brain regions17,18 suggest that the internal organization and size of individual cortical areas are specialized among the hominoids. In a previous study, we found that the relative volume of white matter underlying prefrontal association cortices is larger in humans than in great apes (Semendeferi, K., Damasio, H. & Van Hoesen, G.W., Soc. Neurosci. Abstr., 20, 587.7, 1994). This is compatible with the idea that neural connectivity has increased in the human brain19. More recently we have shown that orangutans have a smaller orbitofrontal sector than other apes or humans (Semendeferi, K., Lu, A., Desgouttes, A.M. & Damasio, H., Am. J. Phys. Anthr., Suppl. 30, 278, 2000), which suggests that some differences can be found in small subsectors of the frontal lobe at a gross level. Thus, it seems possible, and even likely, that either subsectors of the frontal lobes or individual frontal cortical areas have become specialized during hominoid and hominid evolution. Cognitive specialization in each hominoid species would be related to mosaic evolution20 and reorganization of specific areas in this and other parts of the brain.
In conclusion, it appears that the traditional notion that disproportionately large frontal lobes and frontal cortices are the hallmark of hominid brain evolution is not supported. Homogeneity in the scaling relations of some of the major sectors in the primate brain has been suggested before21,22, and our results showed that such homogeneity also exists with respect to the size of the frontal cortex. Our data also point to the possibility that the inclusion of closely related species and larger numbers of individuals per species may reveal that certain areas of the brain present slight modifications expressed even at the gross level20. The findings on gibbons, macaques and cebus monkeys reported here, and results from another study involving humans and baboons11, point to a possible great ape/human specialization in regard to an enlarged frontal cortex that may set larger hominoids apart from other anthropoid primates. The enlargement of the frontal cortex in great apes and humans parallels the emergence in this same group of a unique morphological type of neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex, which has extensive connections with the prefrontal cortex23. Relatively large frontal lobes and frontal cortices would be shared hominoid features that would have appeared prior to the Plio-Pleistocene along with certain reorganizational features reported to be present in the precursors of hominoids24.

Everyone is always discussing exactly how disruptive Bitcoin is as a technology, so I figured, hey, why not discuss exactly what it's doing? I wanted to focus specifically on an area where the technology is:
– Already deployed
– Highly disruptive to existing businesses
– Creates more than incremental improvements (if not today, then theoretically)
– Isn't being discussed as commonly within the media as some of the options (i.e. OpenBazaar vs. eBay, Coinbase vs. PayPal)
I quickly settled on one area in particular: payroll services. The payroll industry is not some gargantuan behemoth, but it is also not exactly tiny – yearly revenues for the industry are estimated around $40BN. Payroll processing services play a large and yet unseen part in the lives of many people, ensuring direct deposits are processed on time, simplifying tax withholding for employers, and simplifying end-of-year tax returns for them as well.
What's most interesting about Bitcoin-based payroll services, though, is my fourth criteria: lack of coverage. No one is talking about this, and yet it could create a fairly large shift within this sector within a very short-term period.
As a result of this disruptive possibility, we're taking a look today at a particular company within the space: Bitwage.co.
I've had personal experience with Bitwage.co – through CoinReport, as it happens; my articles are paid for by CoinReport directly in Bitcoin. How does Bitwage.co work? It's quite simple: the employer sends a request for payroll to Bitwage.co along with either a wire transfer, a debit/credit payment, or a Bitcoin payment. Bitwage.co fulfills the payroll request after the funds have cleared – a few days for wires or debit/credit, a few confirmations for Bitcoin.
Check mark for #1: already deployed and functional. Bitwage is still in alpha mode, and the website is perhaps not as beautiful and perfect as it could be, but it certainly works. I'm pretty sure my bitchecks showed up, and honestly, that's enough for me.
#2, highly disruptive to existing businesses. Check mark. Bitwage.co can do everything MUCH more efficiently than a traditional company could, thanks to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is finance that can be automated effectively, and that has far less in fees. You can even imagine the following:
Employee A wants to be paid in BTC. Employee B wants to be paid in USD. Their employer sends Bitwage a payroll request to pay both employees out in BTC. The employer sends BTC over directly to Bitwage. Thanks to the cost savings Bitwage offers on the employers payroll service, the employer is even able to give their employees a tiny bonus on their pay – around 1%, say. It may come as a surprise to you that payroll services are actually relatively expensive, generally speaking – a lot of checks being mailed, direct deposits being processed, records being created, and so on. Wouldn't it be nice if there were a decentralized autonomous ledger to do all that for us? I kid, I kid; what kind of crazy invention would that be, after all?
Employee A's Bitcoin address in Bitwage's system (which they can change at any time!) is their personal, well-secured wallet.
Employee B's Bitcoin address is their Coinbase account wallet, set up to automatically sell any Bitcoin received.
Employee B gets their USD at the market rate, minus 1%. Luckily, their employer has picked this 1% up for them, so they end up getting as much as they would get with a traditional payroll service. Employers have to pass costs on – whether it's to employees or customers – so saving them money is good for everyone in the long run.
Employee A gets a much better deal (beyond the obvious benefit of receiving Bitcoin instead of dollars), as they end up with a free 1% thanks to their employer's grace and good decision-making.
Best of all: the employer is saving time, money, and future-time. Despite all the discussion of how endlessly complex Bitcoin taxes are… they're not actually that complex, and Bitwage makes it simple to figure out your inflow -> outflow.
#3: more than incremental improvements, at least theoretically.
Check mark. As is, yes, it's an incremental improvement. But it can be taken much farther – and I hope Bitwage will take it much farther.
Why do we get paid every two weeks? Payroll services are expensive. But it costs Bitwage fractionally more to fulfill more often than that. In theory, an employer could pre-load two weeks' worth of pay for their employees, and then Bitwage could pay out daily. This might seem insignificant, but for the poorest people out there who work 60 hours a week to make ends meet, and are constantly living paycheck to paycheck just to feed themselves, this could be a DRAMATIC increase in quality of living. Payday loans could cease to exist – a blessing for us all, as predatory lenders like them hurt the overall economy.
There's plenty more that could be done with this system as well – automation is the future of everything, and Bitwage is helping people step into better payroll automation.
Lastly, a quick note on company responsiveness. I sent Bitwage a ticket to inquire about a particular feature of the website that I found disconcerting. The site displayed the BTC/USD price at the time the employer requested payroll, and then updated it to the “new” BTC/USD price when the payroll request was fulfilled by Bitwage. I sent in a query about this, and asked why it was done that way. 20 minutes after my ticket, the CEO John Lindsay sent me an email discussing it and agreeing with my criticism. I replied to give my thoughts on how best to improve it; I suggested changing the original BTC/USD price at time of request to say something like “Unfulfilled” or “N/A.” An hour later, John emailed me back – I opened it expecting a dismissal or an “I'll think about it”-type reply. What I got instead shocked me – he had updated the site to do exactly what I'd suggested, PLUS more, perfectly resolving my criticism and both improving his service and greatly increasing my confidence in it. It's little moments like that that build great businesses. Best of luck to John Lindsay and the team at Bitwage – I hope to see your disruption continue.

The nighttime of the earth is visualized on Google Maps for East Asia. The detail of this data can be found at Earth in the Night: Nighttime Lights of the World Data by DMSP Satellites.
This page uses Version 4 DMSP-OLS Nighttime Lights Time Series. The resolution is 30 second (about 1km), covering from 65S to 75N degree latitude. Data is divided by year from 1992 to 2013, and also by 6 DMSP satellites from F10 to F18, resulting in the time series of 33 datasets. The target is "stable lights" showing lights from cities, towns, and other sites with persistent lighting, including gas flares. The data quantize the intensity of light into 63 levels, but the value is not proportional to the actual intensity of lights (saturated at bright areas). We also need to calibrate the difference of satellites for precise comparison between different times and places.

Rosa Maria Ortega (Tarrant County, Texas via AP)
A permanent U.S. resident living in Texas has been sentenced to eight years in prison for illegally voting, a punishment that will probably result in the woman's deportation after she completes her sentence.
On Wednesday, a Tarrant County, Tex., jury convicted 37-year-old Rosa Maria Ortega on two felony charges of illegal voting, for casting a ballot as a noncitizen in 2012 and 2014. Ortega is a green-card holder who was brought to the United States from Mexico when she was an infant, her attorney said.
The decision was hailed by some — including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R), who prosecuted the case — as a sign the state intends to crack down on voter fraud.
“This case shows how serious Texas is about keeping its elections secure, and the outcome sends a message that violators of the state's election law will be prosecuted to the fullest,” Paxton said in a statement. “Safeguarding the integrity of our elections is essential to preserving our democracy.”
However, Ortega's lawyer and others said the punishment was unusually harsh and meant to appease those who are “swept up in the Trump hysteria where he is trying to find an explanation for why he lost the popular vote.”
President Trump has alleged, without evidence, that he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton because 3 million to 5 million illegal ballots were cast against him.
Though his claims about widespread voter fraud have been debunked, that has not stopped Trump from resurrecting them, most recently this past week while speaking with senators in New Hampshire.
In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016
Ortega did not vote in the 2016 presidential election, her attorney, Clark Birdsall, told The Washington Post by phone on Saturday.
Ortega was a registered Republican who had been voting for more than a decade, he said. On her voter application, Ortega was faced with only two options — to mark herself as a ‘citizen' or a ‘noncitizen' — and didn't know better, he added.
“She doesn't know. She's got this [green] card that says ‘resident' on it, so she doesn't mark that she's not a citizen,” Birdsall said. “She had no ulterior motive beyond what she thought, mistakenly, was her civic duty.”
In 2015, Ortega applied to vote in Tarrant County, indicating on the form that she was not a citizen; her application was rejected, NBC DFW reported at the time. However, five months later, she filled out another form and claimed the second time that she was a citizen, the station reported. A subsequent investigation found she had voted when she wasn't supposed to in Dallas County, the NBC affiliate reported.
Birdsall said Ortega has voted in five elections since 2004, each time casting only a single ballot. Ortega voted for Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election and then — somewhat ironically — for Ken Paxton for Texas attorney general in a 2014 Republican primary runoff. Paxton would go on to win and, less than three years later, deal the eight-year sentence to Ortega.
“It's a single vote that she's casting” each time, Birdsall said. “The fact that she got eight years is off the rails.”
[Trump supporter charged with voting twice in Iowa]
Birdsall also claimed he and Paxton had an agreement worked out, in which he would dismiss the felonies as long as Ortega accompanied him to the state legislature and spoke in favor of changing voting procedures.
However, Tarrant County District Attorney Sharen Wilson “killed that resolution,” Birdsall said.
What resulted, he said, was an unnecessarily harsh prison sentence that dwarfed punishments most people receive. Birdsall, a former public integrity prosecutor in Dallas County, said he never filed a voter fraud charge in five years.
“These charges are exceedingly rare,” he said, citing one past case in which a Houston-area group was sentenced to three years in prison after they listed a hotel as their residence in an effort to sway a local election.
“They were doing some shenanigans that needed to be punished,” Birdsall said, of the other case. He said Ortega, who only obtained a sixth-grade education, did not intend to commit a crime.
“Although [Ortega] was arrested in 2015, [the case] didn't reach fruition until right in the middle of all this Trump hysteria,” he said. “The timing of this was the perfect storm.”
Wilson's office did not immediately respond to an interview request Saturday. A spokeswoman for the district attorney told the New York Times on Friday that there were only “discussions,” not negotiations, before Ortega's trial.
[There have been just four documented cases of voter fraud in the 2016 election]
The sentencing has thrust questions about voter fraud — as well as a controversial voter ID law in Texas — back into the spotlight. In July, a federal appeals court ruled that the state's strict voter-ID law discriminated against minority voters. In January, the Supreme Court declined to review the lower court's ruling.
The Tarrant County district attorney used the case as an example of why stricter laws were needed.
“At a minimum, statements made in applications to vote should be verified before handing out voter registration cards,” Wilson said in a statement to the Dallas Morning News. “In all aspects of society, people verify their identity. Why not for voting? This case shows a clear need to enforce the laws we already have.”
A 2015 fact-check by PolitiFact found that there had been 85 election fraud prosecutions since 2002, among about 72 million ballots cast in Texas between 2000 and 2014.
“You're more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas than to find any kind of voter fraud,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said at the time, according to PolitiFact.
Birdsall said Ortega will probably be deported after serving her sentence because she will be a convicted felon. He plans to start an online crowdfunding page for Ortega, a single mother of four children ages 13 to 16.
They also plan to file an appeal, though the conviction is unlikely to be overturned, he said.
“An appeal is a very uphill battle,” Birdsall said. “I don't see any joy at the end of that road, but it will be appealed. We will do our best.”

Donald Trump's indefensible claims of rampant voter fraud are now White House policy
A London, Ont., teenager is challenging their school's dress code, arguing that banning them from wearing their lycra bodysuit to class is more a human rights issue connected to their gender identity than a matter of appropriate fashion.
Maxwell Stewart, 17, said the school's decision to ban their made-to-measure bodysuit was about their identity. Stewart recently came out as androgynous – which means Stewart doesn't identify as strictly male or female but rather gender-neutral.
Stewart was told the bodysuit didn't adhere to the dress code of London Central Secondary School.
“It came up that it was the crotch bulge, like the imprint, which I don't think is especially noticeable,” Stewart said.
Stewart feels most comfortable in the multi-coloured onesie, and the presence of other very popular form-fitting or revealing — clothes like yoga pants and midriff showing shirts — makes them feel singled out, Stewart said.
But Karen Edgar, superintendent with the Thames Valley District School Board, said that Stewart's gender identity has nothing to do with the ban that reflects a dress code applicable to all students.
“Any student wearing clothing that is too revealing is asked to cover up … in fact we celebrate the individual differences of our students,” Edgar said.
The Thames Valley board already has a set of guidelines put in place that mandate the inclusion of LGBT students — a policy that is unique in Ontario.
Trans-youth activist and councillor Michelle Boyce helped advise on the rule book.
“A lot of transphobia is buried beneath other excuses, like dress codes,” Boyce said.
“Let's face it, if you put 40 people in a room, you're going to get 50 different opinions on what's appropriate clothing-wise.”
Boyce doesn't see a problem with Stewart's chosen outfit if it's not getting in the way of their, or other students', academic success.
For now the school said that Stewart can either wear the bodysuit with shorts or a T-shirt on top or get a less form-fitting one.
“As terrible as an experience as this has been, it has sort of helped me really accept who I am,” Stewart said.
So today I finally got to touch an Android phone. T-Mobile, Google, and HTC put on a big media circus in New York City (see our live notes), complete with Google co-founders Sergey and Larry coming out on rollerblades to tell us how cool the phone is because you can hack it just like a computer. (Sergey wrote an app that uses the built-in accelerometer to measure how long it takes for the phone to hit the floor when you throw it in the air because, well, he's a geek). And you really have to keep that in mind. There will be many Android phones, and they will all get better over time. It's a platform, yada, yada, yada.
The T-Mobile G1 is $20 cheaper than the iPhone, at $180 for existing customers, and comes with two data plans: $25 a month (with unlimited Web access and limited text messaging) and $35 a month (with unlimited everything). It goes on sale October 22 at T-Mobile stores, but existing customers can begin pre-ordering on the Web already. Expect a huge marketing push. This will be the biggest marketing campaign in T-Mobile's history. (Although they didn't say it at the press conference, I suspect Google is footing the tab). The commercials are already out on YouTube.
But how does this one stack up against the one and only iPhone? It doesn't have quite the finish of the iPhone (both in terms of hardware or user interface), but it comes pretty damn close. (John Biggs at CrunchGear calls it “almost perfect”). And more importantly, it matches the iPhone on many fronts. It's got GPS, WiFi, a touchscreen, an accelerometer, a camera, Gmail, Google Maps, a Webkit-based browser (just like Safari on the iPhone), and an App market.
The first Android phone even has some things that the iPhone doesn't, like a full keyboard that flips out from under the screen like on a Danger Sidekick (Andy Rubin's old company). And it also sports a nubby little scroll ball like on a Blackberry (I thought RIM had a patent on that). And did I mention the compass? It's got one built in (in addition to the accelerometer and the GPS), so that when you look at StreetView on Google Maps and swing the phone around it shows you a picture of what you are facing. Some developer is going to write a cool hiking app that taps into the compass, I'm sure. Oh, and there's one more thing. You can run more than one app at the same time. That's huge.
But is that it? Is that Google's answer to the iPhone—a keyboard and a compass? I'm afraid so. There are a few other minor things the Android G1 can do that the iPhone can't. The e-mail is push instead of pull, so you are always up to date. (Although, oddly enough, you can already push and sync emails, contacts, and calendars with Microsoft Exchange on the iPhone, but not with any other mail server). And anything you do in a Google app, whether in email or Calendar, is automatically synced to your Google account. (Hear that, you Meshers at Microsoft?). The phone comes with a music player that can play any DRM-free songs, and a link to Amazon's MP3 store. Take that, iTunes.
The touchscreen interface lets you swipe pages or drag and drop things around. When you scroll through your contact list, a tab appears on the touchscreen that you can pull down for faster scrolling, which is nice feature. And search is built into every part of the phone. You can do “deep” presses a dedicated search button to initiate a search in practically any app.
But remember, in the end this is not really about Android versus the iPhone. It's about Web phones versus the brick in your pocket. Simply matching the iPhone on many of these features—especially Web browsing and email—is going to be enough to help redefine the mobile market. The table stakes have just been raised. From now on, phones need to be nearly as capable as computers. All others need not apply.
It seems as though many on the Left have a complicated relationship with the concept of tolerance. On one hand, it's a sacrosanct liberal value, giving rise to the impulse to plaster 'Coexist' bumper stickers on Toyota Priuses from coast to coast (message to fellow motorists: I'm a good person). On the other hand, the tolerance brigades often grant themselves sweeping dispensation when it comes to the toleration of any thoughts, words, or deeds deemed to be intolerable. Such intolerable Crimes Against Tolerance can include everything from genuinely abhorrent bigotry to prosaic disagreements over mainstream political issues. For too many closed-minded, coercion-minded liberals, the stream of tolerance and coexistence only flows in one direction. Everyone is entitled to my opinion. When Mary Katharine Ham and I wrote End of Discussion -- which was published just days before Donald Trump announced his presidential campaign last summer -- we opened our very first chapter by painting a vignette of someone debating whether or not to post his opinion about a political controversy on Facebook. This person had a firm opinion on the firestorm du jour, but worried that airing it in public could inflame friends, family or colleagues who'd inevitably disagree -- the fallout from which could spill over into interpersonal relationships, or even the workplace. In our hypothetical example, the conflicted party decides to keep his thoughts to himself, determining that weighing in just isn't worth it.
One of the underlying premises of our book is that while both sides indulge in corrosive, motive-impugning shaming and debate-stifling political correctness, the problem is more pronounced and ingrained on the Left, for a number of reasons. One of the ironies we highlight is that so many of the people who fancy themselves the most open-minded and tolerant members of our society actually possess unusually low 'disagreement thresholds.' They're unable to empathize with, or even countenance, people who adhere to opposing worldviews. Left-leaning academic Jonathan Haidt has written and spoken extensively about these ideological blind spots that disproportionately affect liberals. We also cited a phenomenon in End of Discussion identified by the Pew Research Center as the "spiral of silence," which revealed how people are reticent to openly share views that may subject them to "ostracism, ridicule and bullying" online. Again, people on both ends of the ideological spectrum engage in this sort of thing (Donald Trump's social media army of hardcore supporters is infamous for its relentless, and sometimes abusive, attacks on dissenters, for instance), but now we have yet another data point illustrating how intolerance for alternative viewpoints is quantifiably more prevalent on the Left:
Nearly one-quarter (24%) of Democrats say they blocked, unfriended, or stopped following someone on social media after the election because of their political posts on social media. Fewer than one in ten Republicans (9%) and independents (9%) report eliminating people from their social media circle. Political liberals are also far more likely than conservatives to say they removed someone from their social media circle due to what they shared online (28% vs. 8%, respectively). Eleven percent of moderates say they blocked, unfollowed, or unfriended someone due to what they posted online...Only five percent of Americans say they are planning on spending less time with certain family members because of their political views. Democrats, however, are five times more likely than Republicans to say they are trying to avoid certain family members due to their political views (10% vs. 2%, respectively). The pattern among political independents mirrors the general population.
The least tolerant sub-demographic measured in the poll was Democratic-leaning women:

Democratic men are nearly twice as likely as Republican men to block or 'unfriend' people in their social media circles because of their political views, and Democratic women are three times more likely to take this step than their Republican counterparts. Nearly one in three left-leaning female survey respondents report that they've done so this year. Closing oneself off from large groups of people who may see the world differently is not a hallmark of an intellectually-curious or ideologically-confident individual, and it virtually guarantees that the 'blocker' will retreat further into an insular echo chamber -- which may help explain why so many people seemingly cannot understand or accept that Donald Trump won the election. The smug, judgmental, ignorant self-righteousness this mentality breeds manifests itself in various unhealthy ways, such as physical violence, system-undermining delusions, and the publication of "think" pieces with titles like, "there's no such thing as a good Trump voter." And they wonder why they've lost.

Uber today issued a dramatic apology for mistakes that led to it being stripped of its licence to operate - but pledged to fight the decision “on behalf of millions of Londoners”.
The ride-hailing firm's new global chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said he accepted the company had to make changes to survive.
He confirmed that Uber would challenge Transport for London's controversial decision in court but said he wanted to “make things right” at the same time.
London mayor Sadiq Khan, who heads up TfL, stressed that companies had to “play by the rules,” saying Uber chiefs should meet with his transport body to thrash out all the issues.
TfL's shock ruling on Friday that Uber was “not fit and proper” to hold a private hire licence dismayed many of the 3.5 million Londoners who have come to rely on cheaper rides and raised questions about the future of 40,000 drivers.
However, it was welcomed by critics, including the black cab trade, who have criticised the firm's safety record and raised concerns over the US tech giant's business methods.
In an open letter in the Standard, Mr Khosrowshahi, who took over at the firm last month, said: “While Uber has revolutionised the way people move in cities around the world, it's equally true that we've got things wrong along the way.
“On behalf of everyone at Uber globally, I apologise for the mistakes we've made.
"We will appeal this decision on behalf of millions of Londoners, but we do so with the knowledge that we must also change.
“As Uber's new CEO, it is my job to help Uber write its next chapter.
"We won't be perfect, but we will listen to you; we will look to be long-term partners with the cities we serve; and we will run our business with humility, integrity and passion”.
He added: “You have my commitment that we will work with London to make things right and keep this great global city moving safely”.
The apology came as:
Businesses warned that Uber losing its licence could cost the capital's night-time economy millions of pounds a year.
It emerged that Uber was repeatedly given a clean bill of health by transport bosses with inspections carried out between 2013 and the middle of this year failing to find any major fault with the company, leading to claims the cancellation of its licence smacked of “political opportunism”.
The firm hired top barrister Thomas de la Mare QC, who has successfully fought TfL before, to lead its appeal against the London ban, which is expected to be lodged within days.
Almost 750,000 people signed a petition calling on the Mayor to reverse the decision, and more than half of Uber's 40,000 London drivers have also written to Mr Khan's office.
Black cab drivers called for a change in legislation to block Uber exploiting “a loophole” - simply registering with neighbouring local authorities - to keep running its service in London.
Mr Khosrowshahi's promise to run Uber “with humility, integrity and passion” from now on marks a dramatic shift in tone from the embattled tech giant.
The loss of its London licence follows months of controversy for the firm globally, including allegations of sexism and harassment, its use of secret ‘Greyball' software to track rival firms and deceive regulators, regulatory battles around the world, and an exodus of top executives, which eventually led to founder and CEO Travis Kalanick stepping down.
Fred Jones, Uber's Head of UK Cities, said he wanted to sit down with TfL chiefs as he was still “not clear” what the transport body's concerns were.
Insiders at the firm said they would be contacting TfL today to request a meeting.
Mr Khan told BBC radio: “I'm happy to talk to anybody. what you can't do is have a situation where unfair pressure is brought on a quasi-judicial body... I appreciate that Uber has an army of PR experts, an army of lawyers, they've also made aggressive threats about taking us to court.”
He added: “I'm quite clear in my mind that London should be a place for new technology, a place were new companies set up but they've got to play by the rules.
"If you play by the rules, you're welcome in London, if you don't, don't be surprised if TfL take action against you.”
Fox News' public-relations staff anonymously leaked a false story to a reporter, after which the news channel's PR department publicly denounced the reporter after he ran with it, a new book about Rupert Murdoch's media empire asserts.
In “Murdoch's World,” author David Folkenflik recounts an apparent “dirty tricks” operation by Fox News' public relations staff, which is famous among media reporters for its tough tactics with reporters it perceives as favoring other cable news outlets or insufficiently promoting Fox News.
When Matthew Flamm, a reporter for Crain's New York Business, began reporting a story about CNN's surge in the ratings in 2008, he called Fox's communications staff for comment, writes Folkenflik, a media reporter for NPR. Flamm got no response to his inquiry.
Shortly thereafter, Flamm received a tip via e-mail from an individual who said she was a Fox News producer and was familiar with his ratings story. The alleged producer told Flamm that Fox intended to install host Bill O'Reilly as its anchor on its upcoming primary night coverage to boost its sagging ratings. The tip would have been a significant break with Fox's usual policy of anchoring its coverage with one of its news anchors, not an opinionated host like O'Reilly.
Flamm never spoke with the producer before he put the story online. This was soon followed by an official response from Fox, which appeared on TVNewser, a site that covers television news: “The notion that O'Reilly would anchor election coverage of any kind is beyond absurd and wildly inaccurate. If Flamm is so off base with this ‘fact,' you'd have to question of all his other ‘reporting' when it comes to Fox News.”

Flamm, according to Folkenflik, now phoned the producer. He was stunned to learn that she had never heard of him. Flamm tried contacting his e-mail tipster, but he found that the account from which the original tip had been sent was closed.
Folkenflik said in an interview that the story was based on a former Fox News staffer with direct knowledge of the episode “who confirmed to me that [Flamm] had been set up.” He said he had three other sources with indirect knowledge of it.
In his book, Folkenflik also recounts how members of Fox News' PR operation posed as anonymous readers and posted comments favorable to the network on blogs and news sites. One had 100 aliases. The PR office also leaked personal information to a gossip Web site about a New York Times reporter, Tim Arango, who had written a story favorable to CNN, according to the book.
But Folkenflik calls the Flamm incident “perhaps the most telling episode I uncovered in exploring how Fox News' PR shop operates. They've functioned as a weaponized political operation . . . I've never encountered in the 13 years I've covered the media anything like how Fox's public relations operation approached its [job]. Their behavior would seem to violate the values that Fox News presents to the public of being fair-minded arbiters of fact and truth.”
In a statement, Flamm said, “Given the sequence of events — and the fact that I was trying all week to get confirmation from [Fox News' PR employees] — it's hard to see how the setup could not have been their work. But could monkey typing for a hundred years write Hamlet? Supposedly yes, and I suppose they could be innocent too.”
Fox News did not return requests for comment.
If you thought the main airborne threat in Game of Thrones came from Daenerys Targaryen's troublesome dragons, think again.
Drones are the No. 1 aerial menace—on set, at least­. The production company behind the swashbuckling HBO fantasy epic has issued a strict ban on spy craft flying above the principal filming location in Northern Ireland.
Michael Macmillan, 58, the former Middle East bureau chief for the BBC who now runs a licensed drone-based aerial photography studio in Belfast, told The Daily Beast there was a proliferation of cheap drones equipped with Go-Pro cameras. He said freelance photographers might be trying to sneak plot-spoiling snaps.
“They are obviously not concerned about drones used by professional videographers like us, but unlicensed operators flying in lower-grade aircraft which can be used as a spycam,” Macmillan said. “They don't want random shots being taken as the filming continues. There are also issues around invasion of privacy as far as the actors concerned.”
Macmillan said there were also risks of injury to cast and crew in the event of a crash on the set.
“In the wrong hands, a drone is an extremely dangerous object,” he said.
Signs erected by a security company on the fence of the filming studios in Titanic Quarter, East Belfast, specify that the area is a “no-fly zone” for the crafts and warn of prosecution for invading the airspace above the studios without permission from the Civil Aviation Authority.
A source told Belfast Live there were fears top-secret plot details could leak out if drones were able to hover above the site.
“I know there have been concerns about drones given the proximity to the airport,” they said. “There's also a lot of concern around the risk of Game of Thrones and other shows being caught on the cameras of these things.
“This ensures everybody is safe and it retains the privacy of anybody filming here too.”
Macmillan said: “You are not breaking the law if you are not being paid to do a job, if you are just flying a drone for fun, but if your activities are presenting a danger you are likely to be infringing the law.”
However, as to what the producers can actually do about it if someone decides to flout their ban, the answer seems to be: not much.
Macmillan concluded: “If you were to take out a gun and shoot the drone out of the sky you could well be committing an offence yourself.”
A Chinese man stands alone to block a line of tanks heading east on Beijing's Changan Avenue in Tiananmen Square on June 5, 1989. The man, calling for an end to the recent violence and bloodshed against pro-democracy demonstrators, was pulled away by bystanders, and the tanks continued on their way.
Almost 25 years ago, Jeff Widener ran out of film during the most important assignment of his life.
The brutal crackdown at Tiananmen Square was underway and Widener, a photographer for the Associated Press, was sent to the square to capture the scene. "I rode a bicycle to the Beijing Hotel," Widener says. "Upon my arrival, I had to get past several Chinese security police in the lobby. If they stopped and searched me, they would have found all my gear and film hidden in my clothes." But there, in the shadows of the hotel entrance, he saw a long-haired college kid wearing a dirty Rambo t-shirt, shorts and sandals. "I yelled out, 'Hi Joe! Where you have been?' and then whispered that I was from AP." Widener remembers. He asked to go to the young man's room. "He picked up on it," says Widener, "and out of the corner of my eye I could see the approaching security men turn away, thinking I was a hotel guest."
The young man was an American. His name was Kirk Martsen.
Martsen told Widener that he was lucky to arrive when he did. Just a few minutes earlier, some hotel guests had been shot by a passing military truck full of Chinese soldiers. Martsen said hotel staff members had dragged the bodies back in the hotel and that he had barely escaped with his life. From a hotel balcony, Widener was able to take pictures with a long lens—but then he ran out of film. So he sent Martsen on a desperate hunt for more, and Martsen returned with one single roll of Fuji color negative. It was on this film that Widener captured one of the most iconic images in history, the lone protester facing down a row of Chinese tanks.
"After I made the image, I asked Kirk if he could smuggle my film out of the hotel on his bicycle to the AP office at the Diplomatic Compound," Widener says. "He agreed to do this for me as I had to stay in the hotel and wait for more supplies and could not risk being found out. I watched Kirk from my balcony, which was right over the area where the security was. In what seemed to be an eternity, Kirk unlocked his bike and started to pedal off, although a bit awkwardly because all my film was stashed in his underwear. Five hours later, a call to Mark Avery at the AP office in Beijing confirmed that the film had arrived and been transmitted world-wide. What I did not know until 20 years later was what actually transpired after Kirk pedaled the bicycle away."
On the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen Square, I wrote an article detailing each story behind the four different versions of the iconic scene on the Lens blog of the New York Times . At the time of publication, Widener wasn't sure if the young man's name was Kirk or Kurt. Soon after, Widener says, that changed: "I was on the computer and that familiar 'You've Got Mail' rang out on AOL. I could not believe who it was from. After 20 years, Kirk had found me because of the article in the New York Times ."
Widener discovered that Martsen encountered gunfire and more soldiers after he left with the precious film and that he became lost trying to navigate backstreets to find the Associated Press office. Martsen went to the U.S. embassy and handed over the film to a U.S. Marine at the entrance, and told the embassy to forward the film to the AP office.
"Kirk risked his life," Widener says. "If not for all of his efforts, my pictures may never have been seen."
The next day, the image appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world.

Years later, the BBC flew Widener back to China to revisit the Square where he made the iconic photo. While walking down Changan Avenue toward the square, Widener met a German teacher sitting on the sidewalk smoking. Widener introduced himself and they had lunch. They were married in July 2010. "If anyone had told me that I would return from that bullet-riddled street 20 years later to meet my future wife, I would have thought them nuts," Widener says. "Fate has a strange sense of humor."

A man who died from cancer still managed to surprise his seven best mates after his death - by secretly leaving them £3,500 for a group holiday.
Roger Brown, who had been friends with the group for 40 years, left them money with orders to go on a holiday together following his death.
Retired engineer and outdoor enthusiast Mr Brown had been a regular at the Vivian Arms in Swansea where he formed close bonds with John Harries, Bob Beynon, Gerallt Davies, Roger Rees, Ernie Macey, Roy Thomas and Peter Pelosi.

Mr Rees told the Swansea Evening Post: “We all met at different times but all of us knew Roger for well over 40 years. We all come from Sketty, so it was natural, that as we are all of approximately the same age, we teamed up for various activities as growing adults.
“It was a complete surprise when Roger's son, Sam, rang a few days after Roger's funeral, to inform me that Roger had left £3,500 between the seven of us. The proviso being we all go to a European city for a weekend to spend his bequest.”
The seven friends decided on a trip to Berlin and have just returned from the visit.
Mr Rees added: “We would like to formally apologise to Roger's two sons, Sam and Jack, for taking away some of their inheritance. We spent most of it on beer, the rest we wasted.”
He said Mr Brown loved the outdoors and all aspects of sport. As a talented cyclist he took part in many road races and he also played rugby for Dunvant.
His job saw him work in countries around the world including Canada and South Africa but he came to back to Swansea at the end of his career.

In later life he enjoyed golf and bowls. Mr Rees said: “Perhaps his favourite pastime was sea fishing which provided the rest of us with plenty of opportunities for leg-pulling if not actual free fish.”
After being diagnosed with prostate cancer he remained active, completing his last 22-mile Macmillan Walk along the coast of his beloved Gower in 2011. He passed away in 2013, aged 67.
Mr Rees said: “As guys of a certain age with bus passes, Roger really enjoyed our days out visiting various local areas and hostelries, which must have given him the idea of his generous legacy to us.
“Roger was a humorous and inspiring friend greatly missed by all of us, and he was never far from our thoughts in Berlin.

“He would have really enjoyed our sightseeing, punctuated by comfort stops at the various bars where we toasted his memory.
“Being a supremely fit man, in his prime, he would have enjoyed climbing the 285 steps of the Siegesaulle which was more than could be said for some of us.
“It was a thoroughly enjoyable weekend, graced by beautiful weather, lots of laughs and many memories. Thank you Roger.”

Most Turks believe necessary security measures not taken before Ankara blasts: Survey
ISTANBUL

More than half of Turkish voters think the Turkish government did not take necessary and pre-emptive security measures at the site of a peace rally, where deadly Ankara blasts killed at least 102 civilians and wounded hundreds of others on Oct. 10, a recent survey of public opinion on politics shows.Some 58.6 percent of voters think the government fell short on taking pre-emptive security measures ahead of the Ankara blasts, according to the survey, which was conducted on Oct. 17 and Oct. 18 with a sample of 4,864 voters living in 36 provinces across Turkey by Gezici Research, a research company with accurate predictions for Turkey's past three elections.Some 13.9 percent have no idea if the Turkish administration should have taken pre-emptive security measures ahead of the peace rally, which was expected to be held by tens of thousands of civilians at the heart of the Turkish capital.The survey, consisting of questions for more than 4,500 respondents above the age 18 who are Turkish voters in the upcoming Nov. 1 election, tries also to illustrate Turkish public opinion on trending topics in Turkey, such as the deadly Ankara bombing.Some 24.9 of Turkish voters think the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) was behind the deadly Oct. 10 Ankara blasts, while 10.5 percent say the Justice and Development Party (AKP) was responsible for the blasts and 10.6 percent of them saying Erdoğan was behind it.Less than 28 percent of Turkish voters think the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) is behind the blasts, while 10.1 percent of them think the attack was carried out by the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP).The survey shows nearly 70 percent of Turkish voters fear President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan because of his rough and harsh statements.Some 68.4 percent of voters in Turkey are scared of Erdoğan, expressing their reservations over Erdoğan's stern reactions, speeches and statements.The survey shows that Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu arouses pessimism and uneasiness among 64.8 percent of the voters.At least 7 percent of respondents were indecisive when asked if Davutoğlu aroused pessimism and uncomfortableness in them.The survey shows 56.9 percent see PKK terrorism as the most problematic issue in the country, while around 50 percent of them think the most important problem in Turkey is unemployment.On the list of Turkey's most critical problems, the survey shows 22.1 percent of survey respondents say corruption is the most problematic issue in the country, which has recently seen mass corruption investigations that implicated the sons of four former ministers during Erdoğan's prime ministry.

Former ambassador John Bolton claimed Sunday that hacks during the election season could have been “a false flag” operation — possibly committed by the Obama administration itself.
In an interview with Fox News' Eric Shawn, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations questioned why FBI Director James Comey said during the investigation of Hillary Clinton's private server that there was no direct evidence of foreign intelligence service penetration, but Russian cyber fingerprints were found in the alleged presidential election hacks.
Story Continued Below
“It is not at all clear to me, just viewing this from the outside, that this hacking into the [Democratic National Committee] and the Republican National Committee] computers was not a false flag,” Bolton said. “So the question has to be asked, why did the Russians run their smart intelligence service against Hillary's server, but their dumb intelligence service against the election?” Bolton did not mention that Comey's statement might have meant there was no foreign intrusion into Clinton's server.
Shawn then asked Bolton — who has been mentioned as a possible appointee in Donald Trump's State Department — whether he was accusing someone in “the administration or in the intelligence community” of the alleged false flag.
“We just don't know,” Bolton said. “But I believe that the intelligence community has been politicized in the Obama administration to a very significant degree.”
A “false flag” is a term for a cover-up or distraction orchestrated by the government or other powerful figures.
Shawn continued to push Bolton, asking why intelligence officials would politicize the hack and would “go so far to something that could damage the very issue of our republic and what we for 200-plus years have stood for.”
“The whole thing has been called into question, which is why the notion of some kind of independent investigation becomes extremely important,” Bolton said. “I do think it's critical to answer the question that I posed: If you think the Russians did this, then why did they leave fingerprints?”
Last week, The Washington Post published a report saying the intelligence community believes that Russia was favoring Trump in the presidential race.
President Barack Obama has requested a review of the situation. A bipartisan group of senators — John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed — has also called for an independent investigation of alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. election.
During the interview, Bolton said he had concerns about Obama trying to get the review wrapped up by Jan. 20. He said he thinks the burden of the review will fall on Mike Pompeo, Trump's nominee for director of the CIA.
“He doesn't bring any baggage to this; I would look to him to head up an investigation across the entire intelligence community,” Bolton said.
Bolton said that if the claims about Russia were true, the U.S. “should retaliate.”
“It is unacceptable for the American Constitution to be assaulted by foreigners in that way. So it is absolutely critical as well that we get the facts right on this, and I don't think we have anywhere enough in the public domain to know what the facts are,” he said.
Asked by Shawn about people who might be bothered by the false flag claim, Bolton said there needs to be more information about how the intelligence community came to its conclusion.
“We would want to know who else might want to influence the election and why they would leave fingerprints that point to the Russians,” Bolton said. “That's why I say until we know more about how the intelligence community came to this conclusion, we don't whether it's Russian-inspired or a false flag.”

Veteran Brett Deledio says Greater Western Sydney's young stars are tailor-made for success at the MCG as the club aims to bury its hoodoo at the ground and reach its maiden grand final.
Not only will the Giants have to overcome a poor record at the finals Mecca, they must contend with a pro-Richmond crowd of about 90,000 on Saturday afternoon.
They have won just once from 11 starts at the venue, their only victory coming against Melbourne in late 2014 when the Demons were in the early stages of their rebuild. At their only start this year at the MCG, they were outplayed by the Tigers after a strong first term, losing in the wet by 19 points.
The Giants' poor record is puzzling given their side is commonly thought to be better suited on larger grounds where they can capitalise on their lightning speed. Star midfielders Dylan Shiel, Lachie Whitfield, Josh Kelly and Tom Scully and rebounding pair Nathan Wilson and Zac Williams can all prove dangerous to the Tigers if given space to roam.

As Liverpool FC begin their quest for a ninth League Cup triumph against Nott County, it's time to look back at the Reds' history in the competition.
No team has won the three-handled trophy more but it took LFC a while to make their mark on it after their first appearance, a 1-1 draw against Luton Town in Anfield in October 1960.
After going close against familiar foes Nottingham Forest in the late 1970s, Bob Paisley's men finally broke the club's duck with a replay win over West Ham in 1981 and, once they started winning it they couldn't stop for a while, winning four in succession before Tottenham ended that still unprecedented level of success in what had by then become the Milk Cup in October 1984.
Roy Evans in 1995 , Gerard Houllier in 2001 and 2003 and Kenny Dalglish in 2012 have also managed to bring the trophy back to Anfield but what is your favourite League Cup moment?

Washington's decision to obstruct Russia's call for diplomatic engagement on Syria is unconstructive and apparently shows a lack of will to negotiate, Russian President Vladimir Putin said.Putin was commenting on the refusal by the Obama administration to receive a Russian delegation headed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev to discuss the differences the two nations have on the Syrian crisis. The US said it would not talk unless Russia followed Washington's lead and stopped helping the Syrian government of President Bashar Assad."I believe this position to be unconstructive.It seems they have nothing to discuss," Putin said at a meeting with the Kazakhstan president in Astana.He added that by obstructing Russia's invitation to negotiate the US undermines itself, as it voices criticism of Russia's actions in Syria, but doesn't seek ways to resolve its concerns.Russia this month launched a bombing campaign targeting terrorist forces in Syria at the invitation of the Syrian government.Washington wants the Syrian government to fall, hoping that so-called 'moderate rebels' will fill in the vacuum. It accuses Russia of bombing those supposed moderate forces instead of hardcore jihadists, an allegation that Moscow denies.

FUN FACTS on ANDREW JACKSON'S LIFE
Andrew Jackson had "The Orangery" built at the White House (or the Executive Mansion - as it was known at the time)
What was the Orangery? The Orangery was an early type of enclosed greenhouse where tropical fruit trees and flowers can be grown in the harsher and colder winters of Northern climates where delicate flowers, trees and plants cannot grow
What was the Orangery? The Orangery was an early type of enclosed greenhouse where tropical fruit trees and flowers can be grown in the harsher and colder winters of Northern climates where delicate flowers, trees and plants cannot grow
As many Presidents do, Jackson added more trees to the grounds of the mansion, including the famous "Jackson Magnolia" which was planted in 1835
Andrew Jackson's inaugural reception became a bacchanal on the lawn of the Executive Mansion
Jackson apparently began his day with an early-morning swim "au-natural" in the nearby Potomac River (NOTE: there was no plumbing in the Executive Mansion at this time)
Skinny-dipping may have been just what Jackson needed to kick off his day. It also gave him a daily bathe in the river
Jackson then usually followed with another morning activity of weeding and digging around in the White House gardens
In 1850, the noted landscape gardener and designer, Andrew Jackson Downing, whose namesake was that of the President, developed a landscape plan for the President's House and the Mall
Sculptor Clark Mills's famous equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson was unveiled in the center of Lafayette Park, in front of the White House, in 1853. There are four copies of the statue in the United States. It was the first equestrian statue made in America
One of the most famous copies of the General Andrew Jackson statue stands at the center of Jackson Square in New Orleans, LA. The square was named in honor of Jackson in 1815, the statue was erected in 1856. Other copies of the statue are on display in Nashville, TN and Jacksonville, FL
Jacksonville, FL and Jackson, MS are both named in honor of Andrew Jackson
Anyone could come to President Andrew Jackson's public parties at the White House, and just about everyone did! At his last one, a wheel of cheese weighing 1,400 lbs. was eaten in two hours. The White House smelled of cheese for weeks.

NEW DELHI/BERNE: As a debate continues on alleged black money of Indians in Swiss banks, the authorities in Switzerland have come across a significant quantum of fake Indian rupee notes in their country — the third highest for any foreign currency after Euro and the US dollar According to the latest counterfeit currency statistics released by Switzerland's Federal Office of Police (Fedpol), the number of fake Euro notes seized in the year 2013 stood at 2,394, while there were 1,101 fake US dollar bills.The number of fake Indian rupee notes found in Switzerland during 2013 stood at 403 — the third highest for any foreign currency. This included 380 fake Rs 500 notes and another 23 counterfeit Rs 1,000 notes.However, the numbers have declined considerably since 2012 when Fedpol found as many as 2,624 fake rupee notes — the second highest among foreign currencies after 5,284 counterfeit US dollar notes at that time. The number of fake Euro notes was third highest during that year at 2,084.The number of fake Swiss franc notes stood at 4,309 during 2012, but was higher than any foreign currency in 2013 at 3,729, as per details compiled by the Fedpol's Counterfeit Currency Unit Among other counterfeit foreign currencies found during 2013, there were 99 fake British pound notes, 71 South African rand notes, 34 Deutsche Mark notes (German currency officially in circulation from 1948 till 2002 when Euro was introduced), 23 Chinese yuan notes and ten Canadian dollar.The number of any other fake foreign currency notes was in single-digits.

Frontier at The Glen – August 15, 1999
The premier circuit made the trek to the Finger Lakes region of New York for the annual 90 lap, 220.5 mile event around the famed Watkins Glen International. The race was the 21st of 34 scheduled in the 1999 season, and final race drivers took to a road course. This presented a great opportunity for a “road course ringer” to snatch a coveted Winston Cup victory.
Dale Jarrett's No.88 team entered the weekend fresh off a second Brickyard 400 win and fourth victory of the season. The second generation driver from Conover, NC, was also in possession of the points lead, holding a comfortable 274 point margin over Mark Martin. Three time and defending Winston Cup Champion Jeff Gordon was not up to championship form. It was hit or miss for the Rainbow Warriors, winning four times and racking up 13 top 10 finishes. However, in the other seven races, Gordon finished no higher than 21st. Whispers from the garage indicated not all was well with the No.24 team, with crew chief Ray Evernham possibly resigning his position. Dale Earnhardt created some pre-race buzz, as The Intimidator was poised to reach yet another career milestone. The Frontier at the Glen marked his 600th consecutive start, a milestone started at Richmond in the autumn of 1979. At the time, Terry Labonte was the only other driver to have achieved the feat.
Rusty Wallace won the pole with a new track record, navigating the 2.45 mile, 11 turn circuits with a speed of 121.234 MPH. Road course ringer Boris Said qualified second in his Cup series debut. Jeff Gordon qualified third, rookie phenom Tony Stewart earned the fourth starting position, with Mark Martin rounding out the top 5. Also of note, the No.87 NEMCO entry of Canadian Ron Fellows qualified seventh. Said and Fellows were looking to become the first road racing specialist since Dan Gurney in 1968 to win a Cup event.
When it came to traversing a road course, the pilot of the blue deuce was an ace. Wallace had notched six victories on tracks that required right hand turns, and he led the 43 car field to the green flag pursing his seventh. The lead was short lived though as Jeff Gordon, seeking his fifth consecutive road course win supplanted him from the top spot after the first lap. Caution waved for the first time on lap 14 when the No. 11 Paychex Ford of Brett Bodine stalled in the inner loop. The inner loop was the scene for the next caution just six laps later, as veteran Ernie Irvan lost control of his No.36 M&M's Pontiac and burrowed into the gravel trap. Irvan's car wound up with some pebbles wedged all throughout the drive train, at one point “leaking” gravel from the bell housing. Engine failure ensued, relegating the team to a 41st place finish. The DNF proved to be the final race of Ernie's career, as significant injuries sustained in a Busch Grand National Series practice session the next weekend at Michigan forced the 40 year old into retirement.
As is custom at Watkins Glen, crew chiefs were busy calculating fuel strategies. Cars could typically run 30-32 laps on a tank of Unocal 76 fuel, so it was not unreasonable for a team to complete the race only pitting twice. The first of these strategies was played during the caution for Irvan, which saw the front runners' pit. Boris Said took the No.14 Chevrolet to the point for nine laps before giving way to Wally Dallenbach Jr. in the No. 25 Chevrolet. Over the course of the next 20 laps, Wallace and Gordon swapped the top spot between varying pit strategies and several caution flags. Gordon surrendered the lead on lap 56, allowing the likes of Ron Fellows, Jerry Nadeau, Bobby Hamilton and Michael Waltrip to gain bonus points for leading the race.
Once green flag stops were completed, the lead cycled back to Jeff Gordon on lap 70. Gordon held a consistent three quarters to one second lead interval over Ron Fellows. Fellows and his Bully Hill Vineyards team were in prime position to chafe the Cup community and leave The Glen victorious, all the team needed a bit of luck to befall them. Although Jimmy Spencer and Bobby Labonte spun on track in separate incidents the caution did not wave again until 4 laps remained, when Johnny Benson Jr. crushed his No. 26 Cheerios Ford into the back straightaway Armco barrier. Quick cleanup by track crews allowed the race to resume with just 2 laps to go. Gordon pulled the field single file to the restart zone, mashed the accelerator, and opened a three car length advantage over Fellows. Not getting the best restart allowed Jarrett, Wallace and Nadeau to attack Fellows, forcing him to take a defensive line into the 90 degree right hand turn 1. Gordon extended his lead further through the esses and back straight, taking the checkered flag one lap later to score his fifth consecutive road course victory, fifth of the season, and 47th of his young career. Ron Fellows finished a career best second, 0.76 seconds behind Gordon, followed by Rusty Wallace, Dale Jarrett and Jerry Nadeau in what would be the final top 5 finish for the famed Melling Racing Team. A 10th place finish by Mark Martin opened up Dale Jarrett's championship lead to a seemingly insurmountable 300 point. The Frontier at The Glen would be the last victory for the Gordon/Evernham tandem, as Evernham would depart Hendrick Motorsports six weeks later to spearhead the return of Dodge to NASCAR.
:: Pumpkin Nutella Muffins ::
Oh my goodness, you guys! This is the BEST muffin combination… pumpkin + Nutella! During this time of year, I typically make plain pumpkin muffins and occasionally add in chocolate chips… but let me tell you, swirling in a dollop of creamy Nutella made an incredibly decadent difference! The pumpkin is flavorful and moist, while the Nutella creates a rich, chewy, chocolatey muffin top!
I doubled the recipe below and it made 18 muffins and one loaf to give away to a neighbor. This is the perfect baked treat to give to friends and family! If preparing this recipe as a loaf for others… you may want to buy a few of these darling paper loaf pans from Sur la Table. Wrapped in cellophane and tied with a simple bow… it makes for the perfect hostess gift or sweet treat for neighbors for the holidays! Enjoy!
LG Electronics' next Smartphone, also known as Super Premium Phone, is going to be released in fourth quarter. It is also putting out medium and low-priced inexpensive models in markets to look for a turnaround in its performance in second half.
After having LG Electronics' third quarter assembly with executives and staff members at LG Twin Tower in Seoul on the 24th, Director (President) Cho Joon Ho of LG Electronics' Mobile Communications (MC) Business Headquarter told reporters that LG will release next Smartphone in fourth quarter. This product was first mentioned by President Cho at Mobile World Congress 2015 in last March and it was presented as a leading product that will overcome G4's slump.
However when presented with a word ‘Super Premium Phone', President Cho showed a cautious reaction and said that no one ever said that word about next model. He also avoided a question about whether this next Smartphone is President Cho's debut Smartphone as it is also mentioned as ‘Cho Joon Ho Phone'.
LG Electronics' next Smartphone is expected to compete against Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 Edge Plus and Apple's iPhone 6S in global Smartphone market in second half.
He showed an optimistic view about MC Business Headquarter's poor performance in second half by saying that it will be improved after end of September. “Medium and low-priced Smartphone markets in China, India, and others got bad impacts due to problems in currency. I predict that LG Electronics will improve this situation by releasing new models after end of September that can correspond to these markets.” said President Cho.

First Look at Apocalypse in the Next X-Men Movie
First Look at Apocalypse in the Next X-Men Movie
Share. First look at The First One. First look at The First One.
A poster being given out at SDCC 2015 has given us our first-look at the appearance on En Sabah Nur (aka Apocalypse) in the upcoming movie X-Men: Apocalypse.
While it's not a photograph, it does give us a good idea of how Oscar Isaac will look in the titular role.
The print also incorporates hieroglyphics and Apocalypse's birth name – En Sabah Nur, which was fictionally translated in the comics as 'The First One' – to reflect his Egyptian heritage. The imagery also implies that the Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters will come under attack in the film.
Apocalypse first appeared in Marvel universe back in the mid-80s as a formidable opponent of the X-Men. He possesses immense power, including the ability to manipulate molecules.
When speaking about taking on the role late last year, Isaac said, "With this character I am incredibly interested in the challenge of finding someone that's psychologically interesting and compelling, and actually the spiritual aspects of the character... For me, that's what I'm interested in, in any character that I do. It's a meditation on 'What's their engine? What's their spirit?' Whether that's about Llewyn Davis or Apocalypse, there's an aspect of 'What is it that makes them run? What's their spirit like?' That's what I'm interested in finding out about that character."
He also said Apocalypse would likely be brought to life through a mixture of practical and digital technologies.

X-Men: Apocalypse, directed by Bryan Singer, is scheduled for release in the UK on May 19, 2016, and in the US on May 27, 2016.

“Stick To The Story.” Richard Cowan Interview On Writing ‘Barney Thomson'
Brock Swinson Blocked Unblock Follow Feb 23, 2017
[This Interview originally published in Creative Screenwriting Magazine.]
Barney Thomson, a self-conscious and somewhat insecure Glasgow barber, lives a seemingly mediocre life until he accidentally stumbles into the amusingly absurd world of a Scottish serial killer. Based on the book by Douglas Lindsay, the film, also known as The Legend of Barney Thomson, was written by Richard Cowan and Colin McLaren.
Best known for his work as an Assistant Director on films like The Cabin in the Woods (2012), Meet the Parents (2000), and the recent Fifty Shades of Grey (2015), Cowan now moves from the high-intensity world of blockbusters to the more subtle, independent market with a film unlike anything else in theaters.
Directed and starring Robert Carlyle (Trainspotting, The Full Monty), the film also features Emma Thomson (Love, Actually; Sense and Sensibility), and Ray Winstone (The Departed, Sexy Beast).
Robert Carlyle as Barney in Barney Thomson
What's your background and what led you into screenwriting?
I've been a First Assistant Director for 25 years — always in the movie business. Over the years, I've always dabbled in writing while I was waiting for the right thing to come along.
When I finally got ahold of the Barney Thomson book, I realized that adaptation would be my first screenwriting goal.
What specifically in the book made you want to adapt the story?
It's funny, but what I loved about the book was how the story jumped out at me like a movie. From all of my experience of reading screenplays and breaking them down, it was one of the first books I had ever read that really spoke to me. As if saying, “I am actually a movie.” So when I went to adapt it, it felt like a story with a lot of movie-style flow to it.
Without giving away too many details, I can't tell if Barney Thomson is lucky or unlucky. How do you see this protagonist?
That was always the dilemma when dealing with the book. He's mad at the world because life hasn't gone his way, so you really feel bad for him. There are some great beats in the movie where you realize he's just a guy and the ship has missed him. He does have an angry side at the world but you can tell he's a guy who thinks about “What could have been?”
So as the movie progresses along, viewers start to sympathize with him. That's really the beauty of the story. You can empathize with him and at the end of the movie; maybe he really is a lucky guy. Maybe things will turn out better for him in the long run.
I noticed some flies in certain parts of the movie, specifically those scenes with bodies involved. Can you elaborate on whether or not that was symbolic and if it was something from the book or just something you added to the film?
That was actually something that Robert Carlyle wanted to put in. I do think there is some symbolism to that. That fly is much like this guy who is buzzing around. Then there's the scene with the flytrap catching a fly and that's some nice symbolism that Robert wanted to add.
What makes a good story?
There are all types of different films, but if you lose yourself in a film or in written work, then that's a great story. There are lots of films where you are following along, trying to figure out what's going on, but what I loved about Barney and those types of stories is that you can just sit back and escape into someone else's life for a while. I love that.
It's a moment where you get to spend a little bit of time in someone else's world. For me, that's always been what I love about cinema. When you read or watch a story and you lose yourself — that's what I love about it.

When it was just you alone in the room, what were some of your writing rituals in turning this story into a movie?
Luckily, I had the experience of taking advice from countless screenwriters over the years. So when I adapted the book, my first instinct was to include everything. I structured the characters and laid it out so I could parallel the two stories, but then you'll quickly end up with a 162-page screenplay. When you're married to a story, it can be hard to give up certain things. I found myself having to step away and then going back to re-read and decide what is vital for the story and what I lose.
If you consider the film Catch-22, the book adapted directly into a movie would be about six hours long. I always consider that example because it's one of my favorite movies. Sometimes you just have to tell important stories in much shorter periods of time. Writers need the discipline to remove certain aspects but keep the story's structure, or pace, or parallel stories alive. For me, that was the hardest thing to do. Previously, as my work as an Assistant Director, I knew that if you put a 135-page screenplay on someone's desk, then they probably aren't even going to read it.

Did you have any other experiences or influences outside of the book that found their way into the movie?
I don't think so. Because I've read so many screenplays over the years, I knew that I wanted to keep the story linear. I didn't want to jump around all over the place. What I loved about the story was trying to work between the two plot lines. I think my past influences — where you read page 15 and then have to flip back to page 3 to pick up on something — were not particularly constructive. I wanted people to read it and visualize the film.
Did you change any characters from the book to fit an actor's portrayal?
After doing multiple drafts over a long period of time, Robert Carlyle was always meant to be my Barney in my mind. When Robert brought on Emma Thompson, we brought on another writer named Colin McLaren who really did some nice work. I think I had been so close to the story that I needed someone to bring Emma's character to life. I think that collaboration from when we heard Emma was coming onto the film helped us utilize her character and make her story line much bigger. That was quite a big change from the book.

What did you find to be the most difficult step in the writing process?
The most difficult step for me is when you feel like you're done and proud of what you've got and then you take it out to get people to read it. I mean you're so close to it and you've been working on it so long that the criticism takes you back a moment. People are not always going to see your vision and they're not always going to like what you've done.
Some people just didn't dig it. Not only did they not like it, but also they wanted to change it in such a complex way. You've got someone reading it who has the potential to make the movie so you have to take a step back and make that decision. You've got to stick to your plan. Stick to the story. You can't change the structure of the film. You have to be able to accept notes and hold true to the story that you've written.
Is there anything you wish you had known before writing the film or perhaps before starting your journey to becoming a screenwriter?
I learned a few things simply by watching them happen in front of me as an Assistant Director. You do have to sometimes give it up a little bit. All that work that you've done. Movies are a collaborative.
If you want to get it made, you have to let outside things into the movie. You have to accept this change. It's much different when it happens to you rather than in front of you. You've got your story but you have to learn to embrace the ideas of others. The world is full of screenwriters who are holding on their screenplays because they are not willing to accept criticism or new ideas.
Can you elaborate a little more about the logistics of your writing experiences with Colin McLaren?
When we finally got going, I did a draft and took on some notes from producers and from Robert and then those guys brought on a lot of first-hand Glaswegian stuff to the film that I couldn't have brought. My parents are from there but those guys gave it the extra that it needed. We passed drafts and notes back and forth between all of us. Robert and Colin definitely helped things wrap up and brought the real Scotland into the movie, which was very important for the film.

It is a unique film. It took me a few minutes to understand the dialect.
It's funny you say that. When you're watching something like this, it's interesting how your ear does come accustomed to it. But no, I've spent so much time on this film that it's really just strange that it's over now that the film has been made. I am starting to look for new projects, but Barney has been such an important part of my life for the past seven years. Now it's behind me. That might be the hardest part. I feel like I've sent my kids off to college and I'll never see them again.
When you watch the film now, is there anything you wish you had done differently or any personal notes to consider for your next film?
I wouldn't have done anything differently from a creative standpoint. At some point, you think you know a lot about film production, but I learn something new every day. When I watch the film now — and I've seen it many, many times — I just feel almost happier every time I see it. There was such a long process to get where we got that there's nothing I would really want to change. Getting an independent film made is much harder than I ever would have thought. Before, I only came onto films when we had the money and everything was ready to go. The process of getting to that moment was incredibly difficult.
Had you always wanted to write or did that passion come later?
I think I had always wanted to write. I did take several attempts at it over the years while I was working as an Assistant Director. The hardest part is finding the time between working on films to do your own thing. I did take a little break and really concentrated on it. It took several years to attain the book rights to the film and it took some time for me to be ready to write. If I had done it years earlier, I don't know that I would have brought the maturity to the film, so maybe, in a way, I'm getting better with age.

Zimbabwe army hunts for G40 'criminals' around Mugabe

However, the soldiers denied that they had overthrown President Robert Mugabe, instead saying they were targeting "criminals" around the only ruler the country has known in its 37 years of independence.Wednesday, soldiers seized the state broadcaster - Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC). Armoured vehicles blocked roads to the main government offices, parliament and the courts in central Harare, while taxis ferried commuters to work nearby. The atmosphere in the capital remained calm. The military said Mugabe and his family were safe. According to a statement from the South African presidency, Mugabe spoke by telephone to President Jacob Zuma and told him he was confined to his home but was fine. It was not clear whether the apparent military coup would bring a formal end to Mugabe's rule. The main goal of the generals appear to be preventing Mugabe's 52-year-old wife Grace from succeeding him. But whether or not he remains in office, it is likely to mark the end of the total dominance of the country by Mugabe, the last of Africa's generation of state founders still in power. Mugabe, still seen by many Africans as an anti-colonial hero, is reviled in the West as a despot whose disastrous handling of the economy and willingness to resort to violence to maintain power destroyed one of Africa's most promising states. He plunged Zimbabwe into a fresh political crisis last week by firing his vice president and presumed successor. The generals believed that move was aimed at clearing a path for his wife, Grace, to take over and announced on Monday that they were prepared to "step in"."We are only targeting criminals around him (Mugabe) who are committing crimes that are causing social and economic suffering in the country in order to bring them to justice," said Major General SB Moyo, Chief of Staff Logistics. "As soon as we have accomplished our mission, we expect that the situation will return to normalcy," he said. Whatever the final outcome, the events could signal a once-in-a-generation change for the southern African nation, once one of the continent's most prosperous, reduced to poverty by an economic crisis blamed on Mugabe. Even many of Mugabe's most loyal supporters over the decades had come to oppose the rise of his wife, who courted the powerful youth wing of the ruling party but alienated the military, led by Mugabe's former guerrilla comrades from the 1970s independence struggle. "This is a correction of a state that was careening off the cliff," said Chris Mutsvangwa, leader of the liberation war veterans. "It's the end of a very painful and sad chapter in the history of a young nation, in which a dictator, as he became old, surrendered his court to a gang of thieves around his wife." he said. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change called for a peaceful return to constitutional democracy, adding it hoped military intervention would lead to the "establishment of a stable, democratic and progressive nation state". President Zuma - speaking on behalf of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) - expressed hope there would be no unconstitutional changes of government in Zimbabwe as that would be contrary to both SADC and African Union positions. Zuma urged Zimbabwe's government and the military "to resolve the political impasse amicably". Zimbabwe's economic decline over the past two decades has been a drag on the Southern African region. Millions of economic refugees have streamed out of the country, mostly to neighbouring South Africa. Finance Minister Ignatius Chombo, a leading member of the ruling ZANU-PF party's 'G40' faction, led by Grace Mugabe, is said to have been detained by the military, a government source said.Just 24 hours after Zimbabwe's military chief, General Constantino Chiwenga, threatened to intervene to end a purge of his allies in ZANU-PF, a Reuters reporter saw armoured personnel carriers on main roads around the capital. Two hours later, the soldiers overran the headquarters of the ZBC, the state broadcaster and Mugabe's mouthpiece, and ordered staff to leave. Shortly afterwards, three explosions rocked the centre of the capital. The United States and Britain advised their citizens in Harare to stay indoors because of "political uncertainty". The southern African nation had been on edge since Monday, when General Chiwenga said he was prepared to step in to end a purge of supporters of Emmerson Mnangagwa, the vice president sacked last week. According to a trove of intelligence documents reviewed by Reuters this year, Mnangagwa had been planning to revitalise the economy by bringing back thousands of white farmers kicked off their land nearly two decades ago and patch up relations with the World Bank and IMF. In the last year, a chronic shortage of dollars led to long queues outside banks and an economic and financial collapse that many feared would rival the meltdown of 2007-2008, when inflation hit 500 billion per cent.
Pope Sylvester II and Holy Roman Emperor Otto III were two powerful men and two ambitious friends. Just how ambitious? There is a (very controversial) theory that between them, they forcibly ushered in a new millennium... 300 years early.
Holy Roman Emperor Otto III was a man with a lot of power and a flair for self-aggrandizement. He had quite a bit to work with; the Holy Roman Empire was a huge amalgamation of what is now Germany, much of eastern Europe, northern Italy, and eastern France, and he was put in charge of it when he was three years old. He was crowned, famously, on Christmas day — the same day the original Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne was crowned. (More on that later.)

Like another famous person whose reign was ushered in on Christmas day, Otto was threatened by a mad king, his uncle, who coveted his power. The young boy emerged unscathed after some military maneuvers, and was returned to his mother, a Byzantine princess. She brought him up with the idea that he would civilize the barbarous kingdom she had married into.
Otto III's main goal has been shared by many leaders throughout history: to usher in a new Rome. He funded scholars and artists and he sought to expand his kingdom. He also sought to cast himself, if not as a god or as the messiah, then as some kind of predestined savior. He wanted his reign to be portentous.

He was helped in this by his mentor, Gerbert of Aurillac. While Otto was born to the most powerful couple in the western world, Gerbert came from nowhere. His parents and the circumstances of his childhood are unknown, which means they were humble enough that no one cared to record them and Gerbert probably did not advertise them. The "of Aurillac" part of his name is known because, while quite young, he travelled to and entered the monastery of Aurillac. For much of the first and second millennia, the church was the only way for the relatively poor to ascend to wealth and power, and Gerbert took full advantage of it. He traveled and studied, using Arabic numerals to make calculations in his head that, up until then, people had thought impossible. He put his knowledge to work, designing an organ that harmonized more perfectly than any other yet made. There is a legend that has Gerbert doing calculations that had never been done before by converting an entire church floor into an abacus. He had giant disks made, and recruited students to move them. He stood high up in the church, taking in the view and ordering his assistants to move the disks around as he made calculations.
Because the church was a way to worldly as well as spiritual power, the politics in the upper levels of the clerical hierarchy were savage. Gerbert was, over the years, threatened, imprisoned, stripped of his duties and his land, and had to flee to several powerful courts for protection. The last court he fled to was that of Otto III. Gerbert had tutored Otto's father, and when he arrived, he continued his work with the 17-year-old emperor. When Pope Gregory V died, Otto appointed Gerbert Pope. For his papal name, Gerbert took the name Sylvester, making him Sylvester II. Pope Sylvester I had been the adviser to Emperor Constantine of Rome. The year was 999, and the two were poised for a new millennium and a new empire.

The point is, both of these men knew how to self-mythologize, which is why Heribert Illig, a German systems analyst, believes that the two changed the date in order to make their ascent to power even more symbolic. It's possible that the two came to power at the middle, or end, of the seventh century AD, and simply rewrote the dates to make it look like they were on the brink of a new millennium.
Illig has a few interesting pieces of evidence to support him. There are allegations of widespread document fraud in several manuscripts written at the time, which seem to date from the seventh century. Byzantine documents from this era were transcribed from one kind of script to a new, more efficient script, and the originals were thrown away. Perhaps they were thrown away to conceal gaps and inconsistencies in the historical record.

The change-over from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar in 1582 was precipitated because all celebrations were about 10 days off from when they "should" be, seasonally-speaking. The gap of 10 days was far too short for a calendar system that had been accruing errors for 1500 years. Ten days only accounts for about 1200 years — leaving 300 years unaccounted for.
And then there's Charlemagne. Tall, strong, handsome, powerful, good, and the first Holy Roman Emperor. He was almost a King Arthur figure, a figure that was just secular enough to tie people together without displacing the religious authority of the pope. Of course he had some flaws. He was unable to learn to read, although he always wanted to. If only some learned Holy Roman Emperor could take up his mantle and improve on his reign, particularly if that man was crowned, like Charlemagne, on Christmas day.
It's worth noting that most historians vehemently disagree with this interpretation of events. Although the medieval period was turbulent, and most of the population did not have a good sense of the date, quietly adding 300 years to the timeline would have been too much of a stretch, even for the two most powerful and motivated men in Europe. That being said, it's an incredible idea, that two people invented three centuries, bending time to their will. And it makes our civilization quite advanced, considering we're living in the 1700s.

How big is too big? That's the question the team behind the Toronto International Film Festival really ought to be asking themselves as the festival, now in its 41st year, draws to a close: The event — the largest of its kind in North America, and arguably the world — hosted more than 1,200 screenings of 296 features this year.
With that many movies in the mix (more than double the Sundance lineup, and fully six times the official selection at Cannes), no outlet — not even Variety — can see and review everything, potential buyers don't know what to check out, and publicists find it virtually impossible to bring attention to small, deserving films that get steamrolled by the sheer volume on offer.
Naturally, in an event of TIFF's scale, there are bound to be masterpieces:
Kenneth Lonergan's “Manchester by the Sea”: about a man called upon to be a father and the shattering reasons he refuses to accept that responsibility.
Jim Jarmusch's “Paterson”: as simple and profound as a poem in its appreciation of the blue-collar routine of a married New Jersey bus driver.
Paul Verhoeven's “Elle”: the “RoboCop” director's first film in a decade, a provocative exploration of sexual brutality and the unexpected way one woman refuses to accept the label of victim.
Damien Chazelle's “La La Land”: a splendid old-school musical in which Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling play young lovers whose professional ambitions threaten to undermine their romantic chemistry.
Barry Jenkins' exceptional “Moonlight”: an intimate look into the life of a lost and lonely young black man aching for connection.
But none of these are world premieres. Rather, TIFF offered locals (and quite a few presses) the first chance they had to see the most talked-about films from Sundance, Cannes, Cannes again, Venice, and Telluride, respectively, while the films it does premiere tend to be of considerably shakier quality (the noteworthy exceptions being “Snowden” and “Their Finest”).

The TIFF team prides itself on its track record of having programmed the last decade's worth of Oscar best picture winners, a couple of which (“The Hurt Locker” and “Crash”) were indies that found their first audiences in Toronto. But is it really so impressive to claim having screened the film that will go on to win the Oscar when it is just one of 296 features?
To put that figure in context, last year, the number of movies eligible for best picture — that is, features that qualified by playing a seven-day theatrical run in Los Angeles — was only 305. TIFF is dealing with practically the same size sample pool (whereas Telluride, which spans just four days over Labor Day weekend, boasts a tiny, carefully chosen lineup of a few dozen films, but can make the same claim of shepherding films to best picture every year but one since “Slumdog Millionaire” debuted there in 2008). What's more, TIFF keeps growing, adding more films, as well as entirely new sections, such as 2005's episodic TV-focused Primetime.
To put it bluntly, TIFF has become a dumping ground, serving up hundreds of new movies with hardly any discernible sense of curation. Aristic director Cameron Bailey seems to accept virtually any film with a couple starry names in the cast — provided that they agree to walk the red carpet, of course. And so, two weeks before “The Magnificent Seven” opens, Chris Pratt and Denzel Washington show up to support this thoroughly unnecessary big-budget remake (and downright odd choice of opening-night film), while its distributor, Sony, schedules the press junket in a downtown hotel. Working with limited resources, the Weinstein Company uses TIFF to launch “Lion,” which stars Dev Patel as an Indian orphan who located his family using Google Earth — pretty much the best movie that could be made of a story that's spoiled by its own premise. And Illumination Entertainment, the animation studio making millions off the Minions, chooses TIFF to unveil its December crowd-pleaser, “Sing,” hosting a concert with Jennifer Hudson and Tori Kelly immediately following its premiere.
Not that there's anything wrong with bringing such events to the city of Toronto. (The Tribeca Film Festival hosted the premiere of “Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones” in its first year and still hasn't figured out its identity all these years later.) Queuing up an hour before each show after forking over exorbitant sums to see an upcoming blockbuster in the company of its director and cast — like Mark Wahlberg oil-rig actioner “Deepwater Horizon,” which could hardly be considered a “festival film” in any conventional sense — the local audiences are perhaps the most polite moviegoers to be found anywhere in the world, offering standing ovations to even the flattest artistic misfires. To wit, it took the Toronto crowd nearly a week to rebel against a corny ad, recycled from the previous year, for banking sponsor Royal Bank of Canada, shouting “No!” at its scripted gay-marriage proposal (one of seven such bumpers, amounting to 3 minutes and 45 seconds of partner content that patient audiences must sit through before every screening).
The trouble is that TIFF schedules such premieres back-to-back-to-back and three-at-a-time over the course of its first five days, burying interesting events — such as a truly special presentation of early Lumière brothers films, featuring live commentary by Thierry Fremaux, which played to a three-quarters-empty room — in favor of big marketing stunts, while bullying other festivals to back off their turf. It's no coincidence that late-August's Montreal World Film Festival finally gave up the ghost this year on the eve of its 40th anniversary: No other festival can compete with the sheer scale of TIFF, which has become a giant black hole, gobbling up movies and sponsors and countless hours from more than 3,000 volunteers … and for what?
Traditionally speaking, there are two kinds of film festivals: Markets and community fests. With the former (which include Sundance, Berlin, and Cannes), buyers sift through all the world premieres in search of gems worth distributing. Community-focused events tend to be less obsessed with premiere status, preferring — as next month's New York Film Festival does — to bring the cream of the crop from the annual festival calendar to local audiences. TIFF aims to be both. But when no one — not the critics, not the buyers, not the retirees and college kids with nothing but time on their hands — can possibly see more than a few dozen movies, it bets the question: What point does TIFF ultimately serve? Do Canadian distributors and sales agents really benefit when their films get buried amid such a sprawling lineup, and when being selected is no indicator of quality? (Non-Toronto audiences have long since learned to steer clear of Canuck fare at TIFF, which is why the festival abolished its Canadian section a few years back, allowing them to stash duds such as “Brain on Fire” and “Unless” amid the overall lineup.)
Perhaps only festival director Piers Handling could say for sure, but the explanation seems to be the addition of the TIFF Bell Lightbox Theater, a fancy (read: expensive) flagship cinema launched in 2010 that now operates year-round. The film festival becomes the venue's primary revenue driver, and as a result, programmers are motivated to add as many “Gala” and “Special Presentation” screenings as possible (this year, TIFF hosted twice as many world-premiere Special Presentations as in 2015). Tickets to these events are priced higher (a whopping $49) and are designed to fill the festival's larger venues: the Princess of Wales, Visa Elgin Theater, Winter Garden, and Roy Thomson Hall — the latter being a massive concert hall whose nosebleed upper-balcony views are so far from the screen, it feels like watching a movie from space.
And so thousands of people fork over $58 (including fees) to watch Oliver Stone and Joseph Gordon-Levitt present “Snowden” one week before it opens in theaters, making it possible for TIFF to bring the smaller movies that tend to get lost in the program — gems such as Katell Quillévéré's ultra-humanist heart-transplant drama “Heal the Living” or world-premiere debut “Lady Macbeth” — back to the Lightbox after the press and industry have left town. But speaking as someone who would appreciate having a chance to discover more of these treasures during the course of the week, the solution seems clear: Only by programming fewer movies overall, and by spotlighting the genuinely strong work, will the genuinely deserving movies stand a chance of breaking out. Until then, TIFF is caught somewhere between being an embarrassment of riches and just a plain old embarrassment.
Google's ambitions for Android in the car go far beyond Android Auto, and it just laid those plans out at its I/O conference this afternoon.
The company is demonstrating a Maserati Ghibli that has been completely retrofitted in partnership with Qualcomm to have a 15-inch, 4K center touchscreen (mounted vertically, a lot like a Tesla) and a 720p digital instrument cluster. The car isn't a production vehicle — it doesn't even really involve Maserati or its parent company, Fiat Chrysler — but it's intended to show what's possible when Android is running everything in the car from navigation to heating and cooling to the speedometer.
(Google)
"Android wasn't historically built to be an embedded infotainment platform. It was really built for phones," says Patrick Brady, lead engineer on Android Auto. With Android N, he says, that's changed — Google is able to provide a "turn-key platform" for turning a car into a connected car. These pits Google head-to-head against products like BlackBerry's QNX, which is used by a number of major automakers deploying next-gen infotainment systems (like Audi with its virtual cockpit). All the key components of a modern car are supported: AM/FM radio, HVAC, Bluetooth, instrument clusters, and so on.
Brady says that the Android-based car platform will be open-source and that automakers can customize it however they like. If that sounds familiar, it should: it's not much different than the way Android works on phones, where UI elements and built-in apps differ from OEM to OEM, but all phones can generally run the same ecosystem of downloaded apps. Cars running Android will behave the same way — expect implementations from different automakers to look and feel unique, with different design elements and display types. (Brady also says that these cars can offer Apple's CarPlay if they so choose, because CarPlay and Android Auto are effectively just apps sitting on top of the underlying platform.)
Offering automakers full customization is important for adoption, because many automakers have made it clear that they want to own and control the core experience, which they consider an extension of the car brand itself.
(Google)
In speaking late last year with Phil Abram, GM's head of infotainment, he spells out how some of the world's biggest automakers approach it — for him, Android branding isn't important to the driver, but he wouldn't rule out adopting Android under the hood if it gets the job done. "We're not an operating system company. We aren't going to write our own operating system, so we will always be getting an operating system from somebody, whether it's Linux-based, or it's QNX-based, or it's WinCE-based, or it's Android-based," he said at the time.
It's not yet clear which automakers will be using Android N to run their cars, though, and no announcements are being made today. "We're working with a bunch of car partners," Brady teases, only saying that that they hope to bring it to market "as soon as possible."

Scientists have glimpsed songbirds stamping their feet in a rapid-fire "tap-dance" that is invisible to the naked eye.
Both male and female cordon-bleu birds bob up and down while singing to their mates.
Now, using high-speed video cameras, a team from Japan and Germany has spotted a remarkable quick-step that the birds perform mid-hop during this display.
The research appears in the open access journal Scientific Reports.
Because each bird's dance became more vigorous if its mate was on the same perch, the team thinks the vibrations might be adding a tactile element to the courtship ritual.
Alternatively, the rat-a-tat flourish might be a musical accompaniment to the bird's song, or a visual display - or it might be a wooing strategy that targets multiple senses.
"It's a really rare phenomenon that songbirds produce non-vocal sounds," said senior author Masayo Soma, from Hokkaido University in Japan. "Some species produce non-vocal sounds with their wings, but they usually don't use their feet."

Non-singing birds are also known to perform elaborate dances that can include noises from wing or tail feathers - tricks that have, similarly, been unveiled by high-speed video footage.
But the cordon-bleu's striking quick-step is something of a first.
"It is very astonishing," said Manfred Gahr, co-author of the study, from the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany. "Maybe more birds are doing it, but it just has not been seen."
Choosy partners
It was Dr Soma and her colleagues in Japan, he said, who first suggested turning a high-speed camera on the birds.
"We work mainly on the songs. They thought it would be interesting to also study dancing, and they were right. It's a really fascinating feature."
The team studied 16 blue-capped cordon-bleus - a species of waxbill native to sub-Saharan Africa. Eight males and eight females were paired up randomly for multiple two-hour sessions, totalling more than 200 hours of footage.
"It wasn't very easy to record the behaviours because these birds are very choosy, and they only perform courtship displays to the individuals they like," Dr Soma told the BBC.
So she and her student Nao Ota had to try a few different combinations - but eventually they got the footage they were after: nearly all the males and half the females were filmed, at 300 frames per second, performing their bobbing and singing displays.
Watching the slow-motion footage for the first time was a big moment, Dr Soma said. "We were so excited! It was really interesting. I just kept thinking, this could be a good paper..."
Image copyright Nao Ota Image caption The quick-step was seen in both blue-capped (pictured) and red-cheeked cordon-bleus
When they picked the images apart, the team established that the birds performed bursts of, on average, three or four very rapid steps. A single step lasted as little as six frames of high-speed video - or 20 milliseconds (0.02 seconds).
The dance is all the more remarkable, Prof Gahr explained, because of everything else the birds are doing during the display: they clutch a piece of nesting material in their beaks, tilt their heads upward, bob up and down and sing - all while keeping an eye on their partner.
"It's quite complicated, to do all that without falling from the perch - it's very acrobatic," he said, adding that the team wants to do further experiments to tease apart the cordon-bleus' show-stopping performance.
"It could be that they do the step-dancing at a particular moment during the singing. That's what we hope to see in the future - whether there is some co-ordinated integration of these different motor activities."
The researchers are also keen to observe the animals in the wild.

Will Allen, a behavioural ecologist who studies sexual selection at the University of Hull in the UK, said the team had discovered a "very cool behaviour" but was keen to see it explored in more detail.
"We already know that several non-passerine birds perform similar elaborate, multimodal duets, and that many passerines duet in song. What's new here is that there's a passerine species - a songbird - that is duetting in both song and dance.
"This study is an important first step, but we don't know whether the receiver prefers mates that display these dancing movements, or even that the receiver is sensitive to them. There are some suggestions here that they might, but without an experimental-type design, we can't work that out."

At a time when the government is hoping to make India a regional manufacturing hub through the Make in India campaign, India's chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian on Saturday said that India cannot have a unique model which is export-led and not just uniquely focused on manufacturing if it were to grow at 8 per cent to 10 per cent.“India can't deviate from the historical experience and grow at eight per cent without rapid exports and just depending on domestic demand,” he said at a panel discussion on Asian Growth Models at the Advancing Asia conference of the International Monetary Fund.He further said that it is possible to harness the Make in India campaign but instead of growth being led just by manufacturing, it has to be through a combination of manufacturing and services. “We can have a uniquely India model, which is export-led but not just uniquely focused on manufacturing,” he said at the second day of the three day event.According to Subramanian, China should move from a surplus to a current account deficit to help the current growth model. “China needs to become a current account deficit country to partly facilitate trade led model of growth for other countries and not just India,” he added.Earlier in the day, Prime Minsiter Narendra Modi had said that India is adding to world and Asian demand by running current account deficits.Subramanian raised concerns over recent comments by Donald Trump, the Republican Party's frontrunner for the US presidential elections on scrapping the H1 B Visa and its impact on the Indian growth model. “His comments are very worrying about our model of growth,” Subramanian said.India's merchandise exports in January shrank for the 14th straight month on continued weak demand from Europe , the south Asian nation's biggest market.January exports fell 13.6% from a year earlier, while imports dipped 11.01%, data released by the ministry of commerce and industry showed last monthEchoing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's comments that India is a haven of macroeconomic stability, Subramanian said the government is taking a number of steps to accelerate growth and States are competing with each other, which has added to the dynamism of the Indian economy.

The central puzzle of Boyajian's Star is that although the dips look a lot like those of dippers, it has no close-in disk. That is, most stars that show this sort of behavior are young and have close-in disks, and those disks cause their dips. Not only does Boyajian's Star have no close-in disk, it isn't near a star forming region, so there is no reason to think it is young, anyway.
So, if it can't have close-in material, what could be causing the dimmings? Well, if the material is circumstellar, it must be very cold, and/or there can't be very much of it. Boyajian et al. also showed that the timings and slopes of the dips also put constraints on the material's proximity to Boyajian's Star, meaning it needs to be pretty far-out (10 AU or so). This brings us to:
Hypothesis 7) Comets or other circumstellar debris
Boyajian's original hypothesis was that the dips were caused by giant swarms of giant comets. This remains a plausible hypothesis for the dips: the comets would certainly have been warm when near periastron, but their eccentric orbits could bring them very far from the star quite quickly. Thus, the infrared excess would only be noticeable during a dip. If the swarm is on a long-period orbit, then we may never see them again!
On the other hand, there doesn't seem to be any way the comets can explain the long-term dimming, especially without an infrared excess.
So, my subjective verdict on this is: plausible for the dips, very unlikely for the long-term dimming. Occum's razor argues that if they aren't causing the long-term dimming, then they probably aren't causing the dips, either, but your mileage may vary on that one.
OK, what about:
Hypothesis 8) A cool annulus of material
This is basically the hypothesis that there is a disk of material, but there is a very large (10 AU, at least) gap between the star and the inner edge of the disk (annulus). The disk is almost, but not quite, edge-on: then, we could invoke corrugation or other irregularities that occasionally block part of the star for the dips. This needs to be a real protoplanetary disk, not just a debris disk, because it needs to be optically thick.
There are lots of problems with this:
The Thompson millimeter results rule out very much mass for the disk—there is not a lot of wiggle room between what you need for the dips and the secular dimming and what would have been detected I'm not aware of any theoretical justification for such ring, except maybe for young stars. If the inner edge is at 10 AU, the probability of edge-on alignment is roughly 0.1%, so in order to expect to have seen one, we need to have about 1% of all Kepler stars to host such a disk (despite #2, and the fact that the field has no young stars) The secular dimming is not naturally explained—if the disk is always occulting part of the star the sodium lines would probably not be symmetric, but they are.
So, while an annulus is not ruled out by the data, it doesn't have a ton of explanatory power, and it has no theoretical justification, and it requires a very unlikely geometry and high frequency of such disks in the field.
Although I know some others still like this one a lot, these are just a bridge to far for me. Subjective verdict: not likely.
We've already discussed the long-wavelength constraints that show it can't be embedded in a cloud of material, so I won't even mention that one.
OK, now that we're done with all of the circumstellar possibilities, in the next installment we'll continue our conceptual journey from Earth to the star itself and discuss intrinsic variations of the star…
Huh? What's that? Megastructures? You want a rundown on where that hypothesis is?
Well, I hadn't planned to talk about it, but since you asked, I suppose we could do a brief detour into some serious speculation before finishing our list. As luck would have it I happen to have some remarks prepared right here…
All right then. Next time: alien megastructures.
