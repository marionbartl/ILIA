“I got the Kindle WiFi for Christmas, and if I ever lose it, I will sell a kidney to get it back.”
That's a real comment that Amazon just shared on the Kindle's Facebook page. And what's even more interesting is that new Kindle owner only had one kidney. They told Amazon that when it comes to their Kindle, “I love it that much…”
Christmas apparently created a lot of happy new Kindle owners — I'd estimate several million Kindles were given as gifts — and all around the world, they're already making their presence felt. I was curious when USA Today reported that for the first week of 2011, ebooks were outselling printed books for more than a third of the titles on their best-seller list. But would it happen again the next week? It turns out the answer is yes!
Thursday USA Today announced that for 36% of the books on their best-seller list, the ebook version was still outselling the printed edition. (That's 18 of the top 50 books!) It's good news for companies that sell ebooks, but it probably also means that drastic changes are coming soon if a store's survival depends on the sale of printed books. Ironically, I know of two employees at Borders bookstores who already secretly prefer reading ebooks. In September, my friend Mike even chatted with a Borders cashier who “started complaining about e-books and how they were killing off the bookstores… As I walked out, I noticed they went back to reading whatever book they were reading – on their Kobo!”
At a newspaper in Alabama, the book editor shared their own unique perspective. In an interesting editorial on Saturday, they reported that apparently people are reading more now that they own a digital reader. “No need to drive to the mall, browse crowded shelves or call a clerk – simply tap a few keys and in mere seconds you've got it.” And they also reported that Kindles are especially handy for travelers, as one man in their mid-60s explained. “All my friends swear by the Kindle for trips. One buddy and their wife went to Spain recently, and they were able to download a dozen guidebooks onto their Kindle. That's a serious weight savings on an international flight.”
But that's about to get even better, since Amazon just launched their own original ebook series of restaurant/tour guidebooks for travelers, starting with the city where Amazon has its headquarters: Seattle. Amazon's Vice President of Kindle content said the ebook guides “allow for a little extra space in your bag for local specialties like coffee or wild salmon,” and for Chef Walks: Seattle they tapped the award-winning chef Tom Douglas (pictured above), who's also a one-time winner on Iron Chef America! The book is already available in Amazon's Kindle store, and one reviewer is already applauding the ebook for “A great idea, well executed, and hopefully the start of a great series of Kindle publications.”
But as the ebook revolution continues, there's an even more interesting story in North Carolina. According to a local newspaper, the Rowan County Public Library has 12 Amazon Kindles now that it's checking out to its patrons, just like books! “[A]ccording to librarian Betty Moore, demand has been exceptional, with 68 people on the waiting list late last week… The library's devices contain about 80 titles, and if you want a specific book that is not already on the Kindle, you may request one book and the Library will purchase that title to put onto the e-reader.”
I keep asking if this is the year when we'll see humankind take a leap to an entirely new way of reading. But apparently, that transition won't happen without a few bumps! Back in Alabama, the book editor reported a funny conversation when their wife tried to help their elderly mother set up their new Kindle. They charged it, checked its instructions, registered it, and then downloaded a John Grisham book.
But then they complained that “I'm too exhausted now to read it!”
I'd like to share with you how OCW helped Wyatt Arent transform their life. View this email in your browser
Dear Friend of OCW,
So many people come to OCW and use it in so many ways. I'd like to share with you how OCW helped Wyatt Arent transform their life.
Wyatt grew up in Virginia in a very traditional family that did not support their native interest in science and technology. Disapproving of their dreams for the future, their parents refused to pay for their college education.
Recognizing that their prospects were dimming, Wyatt left home soon after earning their GED. They were homeless for a time and scraped by as best they could. They spent a lot of time in public libraries, where they found they could satisfy their burning desire to learn.
Finding OCW
They read a lot about computer programming—one of their lifelong interests. They discovered some OCW videos on YouTube—an Eric Demaine lecture on algorithms and a Tom Leighton lecture on mathematics for computer science. They saw that these videos were part of larger course sites on OCW: 6.046 Introduction to Algorithms and 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science. Both courses, Wyatt told us, “helped reinforce what I already knew a little bit, but they also built on these critical areas where I had serious gaps in knowledge.”
Working as a Programmer in the Real World
They were able to find work as a programmer, but they knew they needed to learn about programming in a deeper way.
“I realized that I really needed to solidify my theoretical knowledge because, as a self-taught programmer, I knew I had limitations. There are certain fundamental aspects to programming, which if you understand them and you can think about them critically, you can evaluate more effectively what it is that you're trying to execute on. And then you can focus on creating higher quality things”
Using OCW helped Wyatt develop a deeper understanding of the theory behind programming, and it helped them fill in the gaps in their self-constructed curriculum.
Applying at Google
Feeling more confident, they set their sights high. They began to wonder if they might be able to work at Google. Wyatt applied. In their interview, they mentioned the OCW courses they had worked through. The interviewers were impressed with their dedication. It showed character, they said.
Wyatt got the job, despite having never graduated from college. Now they have the privilege of working with and learning from many very smart people every day.
I hope Wyatt's story inspires you as much as it does us. Please donate to OCW today so that other bright learners like Wyatt can continue to use OCW to improve their lives.
A donation in any amount , large or small, makes a difference! If you have already contributed during this campaign, thank you for helping us get closer to our goal!
Sincerely,
Cecilia d'Oliveira
Associate Dean of Digital Learning
MIT OpenCourseWare
P.S. Please also encourage your friends, colleagues and family to support OCW during this campaign.

BERLIN, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden told German TV on Sunday about reports that U.S. government officials want to assassinate them for leaking secret documents about the NSA's collection of telephone records and emails.
In what German public broadcaster ARD said was Snowden's first television interview, Snowden also said they believe the NSA has monitored other top German government officials along with Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Snowden told ARD that they felt there are "significant threats" to their life but they said that they nevertheless sleeps well because they believe they did the right thing by informing the public about the NSA's activities.
"I'm still alive and don't lose sleep for what I did because it was the right thing to do," said Snowden at the start of what ARD said was a six-hour interview that was filmed in a Moscow hotel suite. ARD aired 40 minutes of the six-hour interview.
"There are significant threats but I sleep very well," they said before referring to a report on a U.S. website that they said quoted anonymous U.S. officials saying their life was in danger.
"These people, and they are government officials, have said they would love to put a bullet in my head or poison me when I come out of the supermarket and then watch me die in the shower," Snowden said.
Questions about U.S. government spying on civilians and foreign officials became heated last June when Snowden leaked documents outlining the widespread collection of telephone records and email.
Snowden was granted asylum in Russia last summer after fleeing the United States, where they are wanted on espionage charges for leaking information about government surveillance practices.
The revelations shocked Germany, a country especially sensitive after the abuses by the Gestapo during the Nazi reign and the Stasi in Communist East Germany during the Cold War.
Reports the NSA monitored Merkel's mobile phone have added to the anger in Germany, which has been pushing for a 'no-spy' agreement with the United States, a country it considers to be among its closest allies.
"What I can say is that we know that Angela Merkel was monitored by the NSA," said Snowden, wearing a dark suit and loose-fitting white shirt. "But the question is how logical is it that she's the only one who was monitored, how likely is it that they were the German person the NSA was watching?
"I'd say that it's not very likely that anyone who was watching the German government was only watching Merkel and not their advisers nor other government officials nor ministers, heads of industries or even local government officials."
Snowden said the NSA is active in industrial espionage and will grab any intelligence it can get its hands on regardless of its national security value. They said the NSA doesn't limit its espionage to issues of national security and they cited German engineering firm Siemens as a target.
"If there's information at Siemens that's beneficial to U.S. national interests - even if it doesn't have anything to do with national security - then they'll take that information nevertheless," Snowden said, according to ARD, which recorded the interview in Russia where they have claimed asylum.
TARGETS
Snowden's claim the NSA is engaged in industrial espionage follows a New York Times report earlier this month that the NSA put software in almost 100,000 computers around the world, allowing it to carry out surveillance on those devices and could provide a digital highway for cyberattacks.
The NSA planted most of the software after gaining access to computer networks, but has also used a secret technology that allows it entry even to computers not connected to the Internet, the newspaper said, citing U.S. officials, computer experts and documents leaked by Snowden.
The newspaper said the technology had been in use since at least 2008 and relied on a covert channel of radio waves transmitted from tiny circuit boards and USB cards secretly inserted in the computers.
Frequent targets of the programme, code-named Quantum, included units of the Chinese military and industrial targets.
Snowden faces criminal charges after fleeing to Hong Kong and then Russia, where they were granted at least a year's asylum.
Did they say it? Did they say it? I just want to know if they said it.
There comes a time in our lives that we fantasize about dating the prom queen or stitching the perfect pattern or scoring the winning goal and the crowd goes wild. We all think about it in the dark of our nights but it hardly ever happens because we live in the real world of light that blinds us to our ambitions. You get a year book that says “best wishes” and you never see them again. The yarn stays raveled and the scissors stuck together in the cabinet made of veneer wood that gathers dust. But maybe not this night, maybe not this game. Surrounded by taco shops and stores that sell tee 3 for a dollar, there stood a cold cold ice rink where Bobby Trivia and their hockey team, the Coyotes were playing their 3rd and final game for the league championship. They had already played 2 previous games, splitting the win/loss record and tonight's winner would carry the trophy home. But what happens when the team is down 0 to 2 in the last period? What do you tell the boys who's heads are hung down low in sad misery. What goes through Bobby's mind as the digital clock ticks down to the minutes? Their wife is nowhere to be seen and their best man was out of town overseeing an art show featuring a gregarious Korean Woman and a beer drinking mountain man. But 20 minutes is enough time to make one goal to make the game look respectable and plausible. 1 to 2 now, that's ok. T'was no shutout. But the men with metal blades and kevlar sticks in their hands continued playing with a sense of desperation in their heart and iron in their will, enough to propel another point onto the scoreboard. The game was now tied with 4 minutes left on the clock. At the worst, a shoot out in overtime. Bobby is a defenseman and stays close to the blue line situated about 15 yards from the net. They like to snipe from that corner but 7 shots ago, they all came up empty. Oh “Quiet C”, why have you abandoned your loved one. Oh David, what troubled shoulder will you let Bobby cry on. The puck gets passed to Bobby and with a flip of the wrist, the puck goes sailing into a crowd of players lost in pandemonium in front of the net. The puck drops atop of the imaginary line that crosses the cage. Was it a goal, the black coal just stood there waiting to be cast out in defeat or lurch forward to victory. And than it was gone.
The ref whistled a score with one minute left in the game but the Coyotes held firm and won the game. Tonight, Bobby was no longer the answer to their own trivia question, tonight Bobby became True Star.
“Great moments are born from great opportunity. And that's what you have here tonight boys. That's what you've earned here tonight. One game. If we play them 10 games, they might win 9. But not this game. Not tonight. Tonight we skate with them. Tonight we stay with them. And we shut them down because we can. Tonight, We are the greatest hockey team in the world, You were born to be hockey players. Every one of you and you were meant to be here. This is your time. Their time is done. Its over. I'm sick and tired of hearing what a great hockey team the soviets have. Well screw them. This is your time so go out and take it!” - Herb Brooks, 1980 USA Olympic Hockey coach. Gold medal winner.
Season 2 of MAKERS re-aired March 2018
In the last half-century, women have fought their way into nearly every sphere of American life, from the battlefield to the comedy club, the soundstage to the Senate. Expanding on the critically acclaimed PBS documentary MAKERS: Women Who Make America, which told the story of the modern American women's movement, each documentary in this six-part series examines the impact of the women's movement on six fields once largely closed to women: business, space, Hollywood, comedy, war and politics. In each field, women have pried open, and profoundly reshaped, the central institutions of American life and culture.
Through intimate interviews with trailblazing women known and unknown, viewers are given a rare glimpse-- sometimes funny, sometimes sad, and always candid—of what it was like to be pioneers in their fields. Directed by some of the country's leading independent filmmakers, MAKERS brings to life new and unforgettable stories that every woman, man, girl and boy should know.
Interviewees include: Ursula Burns, Diahann Carroll, Glenn Close, Geena Davis, Ellen DeGeneres, Chelsea Handler, Gwen Ifill, Mae Jemison, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jane Lynch, Indra Nooyi, Valerie Plame, Shonda Rhimes, Joan Rivers, Cokie Roberts, Sarah Silverman, Alfre Woodard, and many more.

House Republican legislators are seeking to strip funding from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, an independent federal agency the lawmakers deem unnecessary. File Photo by Molly Riley/UPI | License Photo
July 18 (UPI) -- House Republicans are seeking to close out the U.S. Election Assistance Commission -- an agency that helps ensure election security -- as part of proposed budget cuts.
Although voting, including in federal elections, is the domain of state authority, the commission's exclusive mandate is to provide a secure voting process. The move to eliminate the agency comes as the EAC is working with the FBI to examine attacks on some of the agency's computers last year.
"People supporting the EAC are quite frankly proponents for a greater federal role in our elections," Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga., said last month. "States themselves, they're responsible for all the elections. We do not have a federally run election system."
House GOP members argue that the agency's work, which includes training officials and keeping them current on possible weaknesses in the election process, is already done by the FBI and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Any remaining duties the agency handles can be done by the Federal Elections Commission, they say.
House Democrats, though, suggest the EAC's importance has been magnified by Russian involvement in the 2016 elections. Rep. Mike Quigly, R-Ill., acknowledging the U.S. intelligence community's assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered disruptions, say cutting funding to the independent agency offers "a green light" for Putin to do it again.
Investigations of the alleged Russian involvement are being undertaken as the FBI investigates whether Russia attempted to penetrate state election databases. Investigators are also trying to learn if anyone in President Donald Trump's campaign colluded with the Kremlin -- a charge Trump and their staff have denied.
South Carolina's State Election Commission said Monday that nearly 150,000 unsuccessful attempts to gain access to its voting system occurred during November's election. While many were voters seeking information on the election, others from within and from outside the United States also attempted entry, the agency said.
RELATED Putin denies election meddling in meeting with Trump
The U.S. Election Assistance Commission, created by the Help America Vote Act of 2002, serves as a federal clearinghouse that administers payments to states and develops guidance to meet electoral requirements. It also develops and maintains a national mail voter registration form.
In a US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling, Verizon was ordered to stop charging users an additional fee for using their 4G smartphones and tablets as Wi-Fi hotspots, aka tethering.
P. Michele Ellison, FCC, Enforcement Bureau Chief, said in a statement, “This case was the first of its kind in enforcing the pro-consumer open access obligations of the C Block [the spectrum band reserved for 4G] rules. It underscores the agency's commitment to guarantee consumers the benefits of an open wireless broadband platform by providing greater consumer choice and fostering innovation."
As FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said in the same document, "Today's action demonstrates that compliance with FCC obligations is not optional. The open device and application obligations were core conditions when Verizon purchased the C-block spectrum. The massive innovation and investment fueled by the Internet have been driven by consumer choice in both devices and applications. The steps taken today will not only protect consumer choice, but defend certainty for innovators to continue to deliver new services and apps without fear of being blocked."
In short, “Verizon Wireless offers customers its 4G LTE service on C Block spectrum. Verizon Wireless bid at auction to acquire that spectrum, understanding that it was accompanied by open device and application obligations. Specifically, licensees offering service on C Block spectrum 'shall not deny, limit, or restrict the ability of their customers to use the devices and applications of their choice on the licensee's C Block network, subject to narrow exceptions.'”
In addition, “Under the terms of today's settlement, Verizon Wireless will make a voluntary payment to the Treasury in the amount of $1.25 million, and has committed to notifying the application store operator that it no longer objects to the availability of the tethering applications to C-Block network customers” and that Verizon “revised its service offerings such that consumers on usage-based
pricing plans may tether, using any application, without paying an additional fee.”
The bottom line is that you will once more be able to freely share your Verizon 4G broadband connection over Wi-Fi with your other devices and your friends, co-workers, and family's devices. Verizon started closing the doors to tethering in the spring of 2011. Verizon wasn't the only carrier to tax users for using their bandwidth as they saw fit. AT&T had started charging tethering users earlier in 2011.
In the case of Verizon, the company started charging users a $20 per month tethering charge even if they had an “unlimited” plan. Those days are done. You will now be able to freely share your bandwidth as you see fit.
I never understood Verizon's restrictive tethering policy. The carriers, starting with Verizon, were getting rid of unlimited data plans as fast as possible anyway. "Unlimited data is not something we think is sustainable in the long term," Tami Erwin, chief marketing officer for Verizon, said in a CNET interview. Thus, we were always going to end up paying out the nose for any data usage over 2GBs a month anyway. If you wanted to use that bandwidth to say your Verizon smartphone and your Wi-Fi only Apple iPad tablet and Lenovo ThinkPad laptop why should Verizon object? The $20 fee was always about trying to squeeze the customer for the maximum amount of income with the minimum amount of service.
Business being busines you will still almost certainly end up paying more for your 4G broadband as Verizon raises data plan prices in the future., For now, though you can choose to use your data plan the way you want to use it without any additional fees. And, in the short run, you'll be saving $20 a month.

A Fox News guest on Thursday argued that hungry students would have a “teaching moment” if they were refused access in the cafeteria line to school lunches because their parents hadn't properly filled out the right paperwork.
During a segment on Fox & Friends, therapist and school counselor Thomas Kersting told host Gretchen Carlson that they approved of a New Jersey school district's plan to reportedly “throw the meal away” if kids didn't have enough money to pay for lunch.
“I agree with the superintendent,” they said. “I think it's a little harsh. You know, I don't think they're going to throw the food out right in front of the kid and embarrass the kid.”
Kersting explained that some parents had allegedly told their children to accept the lunches before the paperwork had been completed and filed, and so the Willingboro School District had decided not to feed students unless their parents had signed the proper forms and been enrolled in the Free and Reduced Lunch program.
Carlson asked Kersting if they “had a problem with the fact that the kids ultimately end up being punished in this situation when it really is the parents' fault.”
“Again, I think it is misleading that the kids are going to be punished,” Kersting replied. “We have more food than any other nation. You know, no kid is going to starve. You know, if one day a kid doesn't have lunch, right, maybe that's a teaching moment when that kid doesn't have lunch. That may sound harsh saying that, but we've got to get people to start being responsible for themselves.”
“I can tell you from almost 20 years working in a school district, they're not going to make the kids starve. That's just kind of like a big warning to the parents,” they added. “And I have kids come to me, I give kids money all the time. And I'm broke from doing that over the years. No, I'm kidding.”

SHREVEPORT, La. — A man who was already wanted in a second-degree murder case is now the key suspect in the shooting death of a Louisiana police officer, authorities said Thursday, as they vowed to "scour the Earth" to find him.
Authorities launched a wide manhunt for the suspect, 27-year-old Grover Cannon, who was wanted in connection with another murder case when they allegedly shot and killed Police Officer Thomas LaValley on Wednesday night.

"We will scour the Earth. No matter where they go we will find him," Shreveport Police Chief Willie Shaw said at a news conference. Police spokesperson Bill Goodin says Shreveport police, Caddo Parish deputies, along with DeSoto Parish deputies, U.S. Marshals and the state police have joined the search for Cannon.
LaValley, 29, was shot multiple times while answering a call about a suspicious person at a home in the city's Queensborough neighborhood. Shaw said neighbors told the officer that the man inside the home was wanted. Shaw says the officer didn't know the man was armed, and they went inside and was shot. They were transported to University Health.
Police already had a warrant for Cannon's arrest on a charge of second-degree murder, which carries an automatic life sentence; they now have one out for them for first-degree murder, which carries a possible death penalty.
Asked if Crime Stoppers had set a reward, Shaw said, "Not at this point. We don't need that incentive. We will find him.  They are our No. 1 priority to locate."
"No matter what rock they crawl under we will find him," Shaw said. "I would suggest that they turn themselves in immediately. Because we are looking for him. I say 'we' in the biggest sense of the word. We are not bound by state lines. We are not bound by county lines. We are not bound by country lines. ... We will not rest until this individual is brought to justice."
A four-year veteran of the force, LaValley began working as a lawman after more than three years as a television news photographer. Shaw described Lavalley as "one of our top young people" and a hero who will never be forgotten.
"He was doing what they loved," Shaw said. "He did not hesitate to confront a bad person."
Shaw said LaValley came to their office while working at the television station and said he'd applied for a job but had not been hired.
"I told them to apply again, and if they qualified, they would be hired."
LaValley didn't believe him, Shaw said, but they assured LaValley that they would be hired if they met the requirements.
The mayor of Shreveport issued a statement decrying the death.
"Last night, we lost one of our brave, uniformed officers in the line of duty. Our hearts are saddened," Mayor Ollie Tyler. "We ask for the community's prayers for this officer's family and SPD as we grieve the loss of one of our own who paid the ultimate sacrifice while serving and protecting the citizens of this city."

The night wasn't pretty, nor was it the fault of one person or one area. As usual when an offense struggles it's a cumulative effort, especially when it comes to the passing game.
Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III dropped back to pass eight times, completing 2 of 5 for 8 yards. They were sacked three times and hit on six occasions.
Here's a look at what happened on each dropback, excluding including one play nullified by a penalty (where they passed up an open receiver to hit a checkdown):

Down and distance: Second-and-11
Time before pass: 2.13 seconds before they were hit.
What happened: Griffin was pressured up the middle then tried to spin to the left away from pressure only to find more. They were sacked and fumbled, but the Redskins recovered.
Why it happened: Griffin had little time to do anything and the receivers were not yet turned around. Right guard Brandon Scherff had the same issue: Their hands are too wide, leaving their chest exposed, which the defender used to drive them back into Griffin. Tough to blame this on the quarterback, though it was a good chance for them to show any improved pocket presence/movement if nothing else – the opening was to their right (easy to see after the fact, no doubt). Regardless, they needed to take better care of the ball.
Down and distance: Third-and-21
Time before pass: .98 seconds
What happened: Screen to the left to Andre Roberts.
Why it happened: Nothing bad here. There's no need to put them in a bad situation so pick up some yards and punt. Smart play call.
Down and distance: First-and-10
Time before pass: 2.98 seconds
What happened: Griffin used play-action and took a five-step drop, only to have their pass batted down by Lions linebacker Tahir Whitehead.
Why it happened: Because left tackle Willie Smith was beaten to the inside and driven back into the passing lane on the other side of the pocket. It almost looked like interior pressure, but in reality it was the left tackle getting moved over. The rest of the pocket was solid.
Down and distance: Second-and-10
Time before pass: 1.88 seconds.
What happened: Griffin connected for 4 yards to receiver Pierre Garcon on a little hook route. But Griffin was hit on the throw.
Why it happened: A blitz off the edge left a man free on Griffin, but what compounded it was Smith also giving up pressure again to theirs inside. The result: Griffin was hit again. It did not impact the play because Griffin was going to Garcon regardless, but it was yet another hit.
Down and distance: Third-and-6
Time before pass: 2.63 seconds
What happened: Griffin took a three-step drop then a hitch step and threw the ball. They were drilled by a linebacker on a delayed blitz.
Why it happened: No one picked up the linebacker. The back, Chris Thompson, went inside to help vs. the five-man rush. But that left the Lions linebacker with a free lane. They had dropped, but when they saw the opening, they took it and drilled Griffin. To Griffin's credit, they hung in there and delivered a catchable ball to receiver Andre Roberts. Perhaps Griffin could have helped themselves by not taking a hitch step and just planting and throwing. The ball was out as Roberts broke.
Down and Distance: Third-and-2.
Time before pass: 1.90 seconds before they were hit.
What happened: Griffin threw incomplete to Garcon on the right side, but mainly because they were drilled as they started to throw. As Griffin started to throw, Garcon was just coming out of their break. At some point a quarterback has to throw with trust in their protection.
Why it happened: Because nobody blocked a defensive end in a four-point stance. That's a new one. Smith blocked down on the play and the running back, Chris Thompson, was on the other side of Griffin. They looked to that side, started to go there but went to the middle.
Down and distance: Second-and-12
Time before pass: 2.41 seconds
What happened: Griffin was sacked for a 4-yard loss.
Why it happened: Smith allowed the defender into their pads and was driven back. The rest of the pocket was clean, but Griffin tried to move up and did so into more pressure.
Down and distance: Third-and-16
Time before pass: 3.00 seconds
What happened: On another straight dropback, Griffin tried to run through the right side, but the ball was too loose and it fell out. In trying to recover it, they were hit in the head by Detroit lineman Corey Wootton, resulting in a concussion.
Why it happened: Because Griffin took off running from a clean pocket. Maybe they were so scarred by this point that they felt pressure that didn't exist. Tough way to survive as a passer, though. In this situation, perhaps they could have called screen just to get the ball out – or an inside handoff to Thompson. Regardless, Griffin had options available underneath. The Lions took away the two deep routes – six defenders were at least 10 yards from the line of scrimmage. In this case, hit an underneath target and let them take the punishment. Griffin had zero shot at picking up a first down with their legs.

SEATTLE - This weekend, Keone Kela, a graduate of Seattle's Chief Stealth High School, returns to the Pacific Northwest.
Their mother, Shannon, will likely get a chance to see them pitch for the Rangers.
Gary McGraw, the long-time Rangers scout based in Oregon who pursued Kela and then persuaded the front office to draft him, will not.
Nor will McGraw be at any high school or college games over the weekend.
Instead, they will be right where they have been every day since Jan. 25: Beside the bed of their wife Julie. On January 25, Julie McGraw, a long-time high school volleyball coach in Oregon, suffered a severe stroke while coaching a select game. They were in an induced coma for much of the next eight weeks and has been slowly making progress toward a recovery. They have not worked since the stroke. Rangers scouting director Kip Fagg simply told them to take care of their wife first.
"I could not do this it wasn't what the organization has done for me," McGraw said this week when we spoke. "They are doing everything they can."
And still the McGraws face a long, uphill battle. The best case scenario appears to be that Julie will be paralyzed. Friends of the family recently helped set up a Go Fund Me page in an effort to raise money for the necessary care items such as an electric wheelchair, an accessible van and ramps for the home. In the first 11 days of the project, more than $16,000 was raised. You can donate here: at the Julie McGraw Rehabilitation Fund.
Kela's performance so far this season has been one of the brightest spots for the Rangers. It has also been therapeutic for the McGraw family. Kela shuttled back and forth between Los Angeles and Seattle during their teens and only spent two years of high school in the Pacific Northwest. It made getting a feel for them difficult. And most of McGraw's efforts to establish a relationship never got off the ground.
It was Julie McGraw's suggestion of dinner at a Benihana Japanese Steakhouse, which they blurted out over the car's speaker phone, that actually broke the ice with the Kela family. Over a two-hour dinner, Julie McGraw and Kela's mother bonded. And Gary McGraw got their first real feel for who Kela was.
"I got on the phone as soon as we left as soon as we left and called Kip and said 'I love this guy'," McGraw said. "He let their guard down and you could tell they were special."
And so now, everyday, McGraw reads Rangers clips to their wife. Them alertness is slowly, but steadily improving. Every time McGraw mentions Kela, whose pictures are adorned all over the hospital room, Julie McGraw smiles.
"There is a different level of alertness there," Gary McGraw said. "His success this spring has meant so much to us at this point. When you are in a situation like this, you are looking for something to hold you all together. This has been everything to us."

Two out of three Americans believe gay people commit suicide at least partly because of messages coming out of churches and other places of worship, a survey released Thursday found.
More than four out of 10 Americans say the message coming out of churches about gay people is negative, and about the same number say those messages contribute "a lot" to negative perceptions of gay and lesbian people.
Catholics were the most critical of their own churches' messages on homosexuality, while white evangelical Christians gave their churches the highest grades, the survey found.
The Public Religion Research Institute asked 1,017 Americans their views on religion and homosexuality between October 14 and 17, in the wake of a highly publicized rash of suicides by gay people.
Gay rights campaigner Dan Savage said the idea that churches send out an anti-gay message "totally jibes with my experience and that of millions of other gay and lesbian people."
They cited Joel Burns, a Forth Worth, Texas, city councilman whose emotional tale of being bullied as a young gay man went viral on the internet.
"He remembers being told to go home and commit suicide and that they were going to hell," Savage said, adding that the source of such attitudes "wasn't in algebra."
Leaders of the Christian right "have redefined Christianity so that it is about being anti-gay," they said.
And they cited other poll findings that suggest more Americans than ever before define themselves as having no religion.
"When you dig down, you found people who said they were Christians who didn't want to be identified with being anti-gay," they argued.
But Jim Daly, the head of Focus on the Family, argued in a commentary for CNN that Christian churches are not to blame.
"To violate the dignity of another person, in any form or fashion, is to contradict the very basis of Gospel-centered living. And to suggest that an orthodox understanding of Christianity encourages abuse against homosexuals is a sad misreading of the very tenets of the faith," they said.
"Some self-described Christians do not act in Christ-like ways toward those who are different than they are," they conceded.
"They save their harshest judgments for the sins they don't struggle with themselves. That is not biblical Christianity in practice," they said.
Only five out of 100 people gave churches generally an A for their handling of "the issue of homosexuality" in the Public Religion Research Institute survey, while 28 percent said their own church handled it well.
One in three people said that messages from places of worship contribute "a lot" to higher rates of suicide among gay and lesbian youth.
Another one in three said they contribute "a little." Only one in five said they do not contribute at all. The rest said they did not know.
Americans were equally split on whether homosexual relationships between adults are wrong, with 44 percent saying yes and 46 percent saying no.
The sampling margin on the survey, a joint project of PRRI and Religion News Service, is plus or minus 3 percentage points.
Note: This is a follow-up post to Writing An Interpreter In Rust
Thanks for all your feedback, explainations and pull requests! I'm pretty overwhelmed by the feedback and I can confirm that the Rust community is very friendly and extremly helpful.
In this post, I want to quickly review some of the changes to my implementation of the Monkey interpreter I've made with your help. I've implemented a small benchmark (Disclaimer: I've just put next_token() into a #[bench] , I'm not sure whether that's the best practise for this kind of tests), and the results are really impressive so far!
First implementation:
1 2 3 $ cargo bench [ ... ] test tests::bench_next_token ... bench: 30,614 ns/iter ( +/- 2,177 )
Current implementation:
1 2 3 $ cargo bench [ ... ] test tests::bench_next_token ... bench: 3,863 ns/iter ( +/- 627 )
The new implementation is almost ten times faster than the first one! Let's have a look at the changes:
Use built-in functions
The first (small) step was to replace hand-written custom functions with built-in Rust functions when possible. For example, the function is_digit() can be replaced with Rust's built-in is_numeric() . Unfortunately, there's no built-in function to check whether a character is either a letter or an underscore, but our custom function is_letter() could at least make use of the built-in function is_alphabetic() .
1 2 3 4 5 6 fn is_letter ( ch : char ) -> bool { // This was the old statement: // 'a' <= ch && ch <= 'z' || 'A' <= ch && ch <= 'Z' || ch == '_' ch . is_alphabetic () || ch == '_' }
In another commit, a loop could be improved using the built-in function is_whitespace() .
Improve the enum
Someone pointed out in one of the many Reddit comments that Rust can store different types in a single enum. With this, it was possible to drop the Token struct completely and merge TokenType and Token into a single enum. We can store Ident and Integer as a String , while keeping the other elements plain and simple:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 #[derive(Debug, PartialEq)] pub enum Token { Illegal , EndOfFile , // Literals are stored as strings Ident ( String ), Integer ( String ), // [...] }
See this commit to review the whole changeset.
Custom iterator
The biggest change was made using Rust's internal Peekable<Chars> iterator instead of rolling our own. The following struct was the original Lexer :
1 2 3 4 5 6 pub struct Lexer < ' a > { input : & ' a str , position : usize , read_position : usize , ch : Option < char > , }
Two people pointed out, that running a custom iterator in the way I did actually is not very efficient. With their help, and Jay Klickliter's implementation as a reference, the struct could be reduced to a single Peekable<Chars> :
1 2 3 pub struct Lexer < ' a > { input : Peekable < Chars < ' a >> , }
See this commit for the complete adaption.
Thanks
Thanks again for all the valuable feedback I received via different channels! Your comments and pull requests are still welcome!
The feedback and pull requests of the following four Rustaceans was especially helpful, so let me give you guys a special shoutout!

How Magic Find Works in Diablo 3
Magic find increases your chances of getting higher quality magical items from mobs. Your increased magic find applies a percentage-based increase to a mob's likelihood of dropping a magic item of a certain quality. In other words, it does not stack with a mob's percentage to drop something – it merely increases the mob's chance to drop an item by a certain percentage.
For Example: Let's say your magic find is buffed up to 200% and you come across a rare monster who has a:
20% chance to drop a magic item
4% chance to drop a rare
.1% chance to drop a set item
.0001 chance to drop a Legendary
With 200% increased magic find, the likelihood of magical item drops from the same monster will change to this:
60% chance to drop a magic item
12% chance to drop a rare
.3% chance to drop a set item
.0003% chance to drop a Legendary
In this case, getting a set item or Legendary would still require a tremendous amount of luck, but the chance to get a rare item substantially increases from 4% to 12%.
Keep in mind that magic find also applies to things like treasure chests, barrels, lootable corpses, etc… For example, smashing a barrel open has a chance – albeit very, very small – of yielding magical items as well.
Which items in Diablo 3 have magic find on them?
Nearly all of the gear in Diablo 3 can possess the magic find stat, however, based on what's been seen in the beta – it's not certain whether any weapons will carry the stat.
Is there a limit to how much magic find you can have?
In short, no, but there will likely be a limit on how much of the magic find stat you can have in order to be viable as a magic find character. Piling on magic find means giving up other valuable stats which could increase your damage and survivability. Since we've yet to see the later acts and higher difficulty levels, it's tough to say what sort of stat sacrifices can be made for magic find, but expect that there will be some sort of “soft cap”. This soft cap will likely vary depending upon character, build, and whether you're soloing or engaging in co-op play.
Magic Finding in Solo Play
Solo play offers the biggest boost to magic find for two reasons: you get to enjoy all of your magic find stat without a group average bringing you down (see co-op play below) – and – you can bring a magic find equipped follower along. However, it's likely that solo magic finding will not be as effective as group magic finding. The reason being, groups will be tearing through mobs much quicker, therefore more items will be dropping.
Followers and magic find
Followers provide players with 20% of their magic find stat. So, if you're solo magic finding with a follower who has 140% magic find on their gear, you'll gain an additional 28% magic find.
This 20% stat inheritance also applies to gold find and experience gain stats.
Magic Finding in Co-Op Play
When players are in a party, their magic find % is added to all of the other players' magic find in the group, then redistributed to the group as an average.
For example, if you have 150% magic find, then enter a group with three other players who have: 80% MF, 0 MF, and 20% MF – respectively – then the group average would be 62.5% magic find per player (250% MF / 4).
For the guy bringing 150% MF to the group, this would be sort of a bummer, but…this would be offset by the killing power of the group. Obviously, the player with 0 magic finds will benefit the most – since they will be inheriting a free 62.5% – however, they may also be producing a healthy portion of the group's damage, thus earning their keep.
Is magic finding more successful in groups?
This answer is fairly subjective, but in most cases, yes. Although you can stack more of the stat if you're playing solo, you'll down a lot more mobs within the same time frame while farming in a group. More kills = more drops.
However, for a highly skilled player, solo magic finding may be the way to go. You may not kill mobs quite as fast – but with a good build and stacked MF (including a +MF follower) – you could certainly be an effective MF farmer due to the extreme magic find boost you can have while playing solo.
Magic finding in groups = more loot
The loot system in Diablo 3 has changed from Diablo 2, in that loot is now designated. Instead of each player furiously scrambling to click on, and snatch up all of the loot after a boss kill, players will now only be able to see and pick up the loot intended for them.
When magic finding in a group, you won't be rewarded with any additional loot, but you may have access to a wider variety of loot – depending on whether or not your party members are friendly. If so, they may be able to trade or sell you an item drop that your character can use, but instead had been designated to them.
For example: If you down the Skeleton King with three other players, that means he's going to drop 4 times the amount of loot that they would drop if you were soloing him. That means a 4x greater chance that they could drop something you need. Thing is, though, you'd need to be in a group with players who'd be willing to open trade with you in order for you to benefit from the additional chance at loot.
If you're in a party with friends, group magic finding will definitely be the way to go.
Nephalem Valor Buff
The Nephalem Valor buff is an exciting new game mechanic that the Diablo 3 devs are planning to implement once the game goes live. Here is how it works…
Whether in a solo or public game, when someone kills a rare mob or pack of champions – each player in the game is granted a magic find buff, called Nephalem Valor. At present, the buff doesn't have an expiration, but it will be cancelled if you swap out skills, swap out a skill rune, or leave the game. It's also possible that the buff might cancel upon death, but this hasn't been confirmed.
The Nephalem Valor buff gives players a reason to stick within the same game – plowing through loads of monsters and bosses – rather than constantly creating new games and farming one or two bosses repeatedly.
The other idea behind it is to have players gain a magic find advantage, while sticking with a current build. There will likely be an ideal magic find build for each class, but Blizzard wants to encourage players to spend some time with each build, rather than swapping about all fancy crazy. I guess they feel the Nephalem Valor buff will give players a reason to really spend some time with a build before they try out another.
Fortune Shrine
If you encounter a Fortune Shrine, grab it and make your way to the nearest area with a rare monster, or do a boss run if you are close enough. Fortune Shrines increase magic and gold find by 25% for 2 minutes. This isn't a huge buff, but it is a decent magic find buff nonetheless.
You'll often find that these Fortune Shrines are “conveniently” placed in random dungeons and areas that are rife with champions and rares, so you seldom have to travel far anyway.
Magic Find Classes and Builds
It's too early to say which class(es) will have the best advantage for magic finding, but the early predictions have Barbarian, Wizard and Witch Doctor in the lead, as far as solo play is concerned.
Barbarian
Barbarians have the advantage of being the only class in the game with a rune skill (Birthright) that benefits from magic find — Hammer of the Ancients can be runed to increase loot drops. The rune doesn't increase magic find, but it does cause mobs to drop additional loot, which could be magical, rare, etc… Barbs also have high survivability, which is of paramount importance to being a good MF'er (Magic Finder, that is…).
Wizard
Wizards should be decent at magic finding due to their ranged attacks, AoE spells, and ability to teleport – which will be useful for escaping damage and for moving through the game world quickly.
Witch Doctor
Witch Doctors will have the advantage of ranged attacks, along with minions who will be able to tank and do damage. It's tough to say how formidable the WD's minions will be if clad in high MF gear, but regardless…the Witch Doctor should still prove effective at magic finding.
Demon Hunter
The Demon Hunter could be an effective magic find class, but I suppose they'd be a bit limited by having to use a 2H bow in order to maximize the bonus. A dual wielding DH would lose out on any magic find bonus gained from an off-hand (quiver, in the case of the DH). I also think the Wizard might be better suited overall due to their increased variety of ranged spells, AoE and mobility…but then I could be wrong.
Monk
I'm sure Monks will be a good support class in magic find groups – with their decent DPS, mantras and heals – but for solo magic finding I don't think they'll be all that effective. Barbarians will likely be the melee MF class in Diablo 3 due to their higher survivability and rune skill benefits.
For magic finding, ranged classes have a leg up due to their ability to kite, which reduces the amount of damage taken. Monks might have problems getting one-shotted while in melee range, where as a Barbarian will be able to withstand quite a bit more punishment. Plus, the Monk's DPS stat (agility) grants dodge chance, where as the Barb's (strength) grants armor. Armor provides a straight damage reduction, while dodge is up to the game's RNG (random number generator) to determine whether you get hit or not.
For melee magic find, go with a Barb. At least, that's what I think. 😉
Magic Finding and Multiboxing
For those not familiar with multiboxing, it's where a single player control multiple characters at once within the same game. This requires separate Diablo 3 accounts, along with software and hardware to allow for it. As long as you don't use any sort of bot, Blizzard is fine with players multiboxing – provided they are physically controlling each character.
Multiboxers are likely getting pumped about the prospects of magic finding in Diablo 3. Multiboxers will be able to form very balanced magic find groups, while being able to ensure that their players are stacked with the highest possible amount of MF. In addition, multiboxers will also be able to ensure the loot goes to the proper characters. Although loot is designated to each player in a party, it does become tradable once that player picks it up. A multiboxer would be able to loot a crossbow on their Monk, then open trade with their Demon Hunter in the same party.
Multiboxing will allow for maximum magic find stacking, as well as serious loot potential.
Met police spokesperson says London residents are concerned over deaths of three men after police used Taser or pepper spray
The recent spate of deaths following incidents involving police has stoked tensions among London communities before the Notting Hill carnival, a senior Scotland Yard officer has admitted.
Commander Steve Rodhouse revealed that residents in the capital had raised concerns with the Met over policing strategy after the deaths of three men following contact with officers during the past 12 days.
Bodybuilder Dale Burns, 27, from Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, amateur rugby league player Jacob Michael, 25, from Widnes, Cheshire, and Philip Hulmes, 53, a delivery driver from near Bolton all died following incidents in which police used either Taser weapons or pepper spray.
Rodhouse, Metropolitan police spokesperson for the carnival, said: "It is quite clear from talking to our communities that despite the fact that these deaths have actually been out of the capital and in the north, these deaths still resonate in our communities and we are aware of that when we are looking to test the tensions that exist within the capital.
"We try and take that into account to understand what is causing concern across the capital and the country."
Some Met officers have expressed disquiet over what they describe as a growing anti-police sentiment before Notting Hill carnival, which begins on Sunday, and which will feature a record number of officers to counter potential trouble following the London riots earlier this month. The carnival, expected to draw crowds of more than 1 million, represents Scotland Yard's biggest public order test since the widespread disorder and coincides with high anxiety levels among many London communities.
In particular, details relating to the death of Michael who was pepper-sprayed after being arrested by up to 11 police officers have prompted concern.
Witnesses have described Michael being kicked and hit with police batons and officers sitting on them in the street near their home on Monday after being pepper-sprayed. The 25-year-old was taken to a police station where they became unwell and was rushed to hospital by ambulance. They were pronounced dead two hours later.
On Friday Rodhouse admitted that the death of Michael had been raised by concerned London residents during meetings with community organisers.
They said: "We spend an awful lot of time speaking to community members who can assist us with what is of concern and that incident has come up. We're very aware that incidents that take place in the rest of the country can still cause tension, uncertainty, in communities across London and elsewhere."
The day after Michael's death, Hulmes died after they were shot with a Taser during an incident at their home, although a postmortem concluded they died from self-inflicted stab wounds. Burns died on 16 August after officers reportedly shot them three times with a 50,000 volt Taser following reports of a disturbance at their Barrow-in-Furness flat.
Rodhouse, though, said that there were "no special arrangements" for the use of Taser during the carnival other than it remained an option as normal.
Met officers are also aware that another death following police contact, this time the shooting of Mark Duggan by a Met CO19 firearms officer, remains a simmering source of tension. The death of Duggan, 29, in Tottenham Hale, north London, was pivotal to triggering the UK riots. Their funeral is scheduled for 9 September.
Rodhouse added that a petrol bomb attack on a marked police car patrolling Edmonton, north London, the day after Hulmes died was being looked at in the context of its timing before carnival.
Officers monitoring social networking sites in advance of the carnival say that online chatter is "similar" to previous years and are hoping that contingency measures such as the earlier than normal finishing time of the carnival would help minimise disorder.
Rodhouse added: "Historically, and almost inevitably, there is a degree of disorder every year at the Notting Hill carnival, what we see after dark particularly, is low-level disorder."
Knife arches, stop and search and the use of "spotters" to identify troublemakers will all be in use during the carnival, Europe's largest street party.
Tripoli, Lebanon (CNN) — The ancient Lebanese port city of Tripoli is possibly the last place anyone would expect to find an abandoned trove of futuristic modern architecture.
But weirdly, that's exactly what can be found among its 14th-century mosques, arcades and schools. Even more weirdly, it's almost always deserted.
These space-age buildings are the work of Brazilian Oscar Niemeyer, widely considered one of the founders of modern architecture.
They designed the 10,000-hectare site, intended as an international fairground, after a single visit to Tripoli in 1962. Construction, however, was halted at the outset of Lebanon's civil war in 1975, and never resumed.
Despite some damage inflicted during the war, and Syrian army occupation of the site in the 1970s and '80s, the structures still stand largely intact.
But few people visit beyond evening joggers and the occasional tourist, marveling at having struck Instagram gold. That needn't be the case -- enterprising local Tripoli Mira Minkara gives regular tours of the fairground.
CNN joined them to find out more.
So why's it here?
An architecturally cutting-edge fairground attracting tourists and delegates from around the world over might seem like an anomaly in today's Lebanon, struggling to hold its ground as violence and refugees from the war in neighboring Syria threaten to engulf it.
But in the 1960s Lebanon was swinging , a hotbed for intellectuals and jet-set starlets from Europe and the U.S., as well as the Arab world. And along came Niemeyer with their grand vision -- and they didn't hold back.
As well as Jetsonesque monuments, the Tripoli park includes an outdoor theater space surrounded by a moat-like reflective pool (a Niemeyer hallmark).
Unfulfilled dream

There's a restaurant at the top of a tower, a helipad, an experimental sound dome, a convention hall, housing for potential convention delegates -- now the Quality Inn -- and a "Sinatra in Palm Springs"-style home for the head architect.
The imposing structures stand empty, some in various stages of ruin, as modernist symbols of an ambitious, unfulfilled dream for a city whose poverty rates are now the highest in Lebanon.
The government made some additions in the 1990s, under the aegis of influential prime minister Rafic Hariri, to make the space more usable.
These include glass panels in the windows of the cavernous convention hall, and white plastic chairs in the open-air theater space.
Despite this, the only regular event taking place in the fairground is an annual book fair, says tour guide Minkara.
"I call it Lebanon's modern ruins," they laugh, on a sunset walk through the grounds. "We have so many ruins in this country, but these are the only ones that look post-apocalyptic."
Here are the highlights:
The Gate

"As you can see, it's not really a gate," says Minkara as we pass under the massive block of reinforced concrete that marks the entrance to the park.
The eight-meter-high structure gives viewers their first view of a giant concrete awning that Niemeyer called la grande couverture (the big cover), the arch, and some of the park's other tall monuments.
Standing under the gate's soaring roof, one gets the feeling of space rather than restriction.
"You feel there are no limits," Minkara says, "which is contradictory to what we think of as a gate."
Exhibition Center
In the 1990s, the exhibition center played host to a number of events, like an annual African fair where Minkara would spend their pocket money as a teenager.
Now, dust and rubble sits atop drab gray carpeting that looks straight out of "The Office."
However, the center's 750-meter concrete awning, which curves so as to make the end always just out of site, is an attraction in and of itself.
The grande couverture is a testament to the architect's fascination with limits and edges, says Minkara. "The site has no vertical abstractions," they insist, to disrupt the aesthetic of limitless space.
Niemeyer was also inspired by curves found in the natural world -- in mountains, waves, and "on the body of the beloved woman," he's reported to have said.
The architect designed la grande couverture to have a skylight shaped like a pointed oval, which some architects believe is a reference to a specific part of the female anatomy.
"This is just a theory," says Minkara, "but it's true that they were inspired by the female form."
Experimental Theater or 'The Dome'

Niemeyer's Experimental Theater is a huge dome with thick concrete walls rising at an extreme angle from the ground.
"It's not easy to make such a form without concrete, so in the '50s and '60s it was considered extremely modern," says Minkara.
The dome was intended as a performance space. There's a central stage powered by a hydraulic jet to adjust the height, as well as a stage behind the audience area to allow for a surrounding effect.
Acoustics, of course, are built in.
By way of its shape, the dome features a natural "whispering effect," whereby people standing on opposite ends of the structure can hear each other clearly at a whisper.
Shouting produces reverberating echoes.
"This structure usually stimulates a lot of emotion in people," says Minkara.
Helipad
Basically a helipad in name only as "only very small helicopters can land here," Niemeyer's structure is shaped like a lotus flower, with a bright red spiral staircase leading from the landing surface to ground level.
Beneath the helipad, Niemeyer planned a subterranean space museum.
"It was the '60s," Minkara says, "they were invading space, everybody was obsessed with the idea of landing on the moon."
But unlike the moon landing, this idea was never realized -- the underground level currently serves as a storage area.

This is the focal center point of the park. There's a steep ramp leading up to the soaring arch at the top; from here it's possible to see the stage, and the white seats which create a satisfying honeycomb effect.
The concrete stage with its sail-shaped sound amplifier (Niemeyer called it a voile acoustique, or acoustics veil), and the white seats added in the '90s are perhaps the most photographed sites at the park; the arch is iconic enough to appear as a special Tripoli filter on Snapchat.
Like the Lebanese Pavilion, the stage is meant to be surrounded by water, separating the performers from their audience.
"In the 1990s, Russian ballets, Arabic singers, and rock bands played here -- but that stopped when the assassinations began in 2003," Minkara says, referring to the spate of killings that took the life of former prime minister Rafic Hariri in 2005, among others.
No one now treads the concrete boards of the stage except skateboarders and the occasional tourist.
Lebanese Pavilion
The park's only major departure from Niemeyer's signature space-age design style, the Lebanese Pavilion's arches were inspired by Lebanon's traditional architecture , an amalgam of Ottoman, Islamic, and Venetian styles.
Niemeyer intended the pavilion to be a multi-level gallery space for exhibitions related to Lebanon, surrounded by a pool of water so the building's arches would be reflected by the water.
The arches of the pavilion "are more stretched" than those of the Lebanese house, says Minkara, because concrete allowed a more dramatic curve than the traditional wood.
The effect is that while inside, one still has the feeling of being outside -- a central theme to many of Niemeyer's constructions.
The pointed arches also reflect the shape of the peaks of Mount Lebanon in the distance, pink against the setting sun.
Mira Minkara runs guided tours starting at $20 per person. Private tours start at $300.

6 Tips From Harvard Psychologists Who Studied What It Takes to Raise 'Good' Kids

Bright Side would like to share with you six such pieces of advice about caring for and raising your child that have come straight from experts at Harvard University.
1. Spend time with your kids
This is the basis for everything. You should regularly spend time with your kids, take an interest in their hobbies as well as their problems, and, most importantly, listen to what they have to say. You'll not only learn much about your son or daughter's unique personality, but your actions will provide them with an example of how to show care and attention for others.
2. Always tell your child what they or they mean to you
According to research carried out by psychologists, many children don't know that they're the most important person in the world to their parents. They genuinely need to hear these words from you. Don't forget to say them as often as possible so that your child feels safe, loved, and valued.
3. Show them how to resolve problems and not run away from them
For example, if your child suddenly decides they want to give up football training, ask them to explain why they want to do this, as well as the obligations they have to their teammates. If they still want to give it up, help them to find something new to ignite their passions.
4. Train them to help you out with something every day, and show that you're grateful for their assistance
Research shows that people who are used to expressing their gratitude are more inclined to feel compassion for others, are more generous, and love to help. So it's worth developing a set of daily activities that your child can help you with at home, for which you can thank them at every stage of the day. Psychologists also recommend rewarding children for genuine displays of kindness and the effort they put into helping you.
5. Help your child cope with their negative emotions
Psychologists believe that the ability to care for others is suppressed by such negative emotions as anger, hatred, shame, and envy. In helping children to comprehend these negative feelings, it will push them towards resolving their internal conflicts. Self-analysis of this kind will set them on the long path to becoming compassionate, caring individuals. It's also important for establishing psychological stability.
6. Show them that the world is far bigger, more complex, and more interesting than they could ever imagine
According to research carried out by psychologists, almost all children are interested only in the small world of their family and friends. It's crucial that they also learn to take an interest in the people and events outside this limited circle, which may differ from what they know in social, cultural, and geographical terms. You can help them with this by learning to be a good listener who can place themself in someone else's shoes and feel empathy, whether it's through films, photographs, or the news.
Some final important words from the experts at Harvard: 'Raising a child to be polite, caring, and compassionate is a very difficult task. But it's exactly what all of us are capable of doing. And nothing else in the world will ever compare to the importance of this or the priceless joy you feel from it when it's achieved.'

Plans for a sculpture near a Welsh castle have been shelved after thousands signed a petition claiming it celebrates the “subjugation and oppression” of the Welsh people. Here, Dr Matthew Stevens argues that is a misguided stance which fails to recognise the rich historical and cultural inheritance of Wales.
It saddens me to see the negative popular reaction of some to the recently approved art instillation at Flint Castle.
It is a reaction that radically underplays the deep, rich, fascinating and, most importantly, complex medieval cultural inheritance of Wales.
I worry, though I would be reluctant to say for sure, that it might also underscore a troublesome lack of self-confidence in a proud Welsh identity.
In 1066, some 951 years ago, a Norman Frenchman and their rabble conquered England and secured it with their own iron ring of castles, the centrepiece of which was the Tower of London.
The Tower is now celebrated not as the instrument of Norman oppression it was created as, but as part of the rich tapestry of English heritage. In 1277, some 740 years ago, Flint castle was begun by Edward I. Cannot we too, as a nation, manage similarly to wrest free our own cultural inheritance from the centuries-old past, and make Wales' iron ring our own?
(Image: Cadw/Crown Copyright)
As noted in the Welsh Government press release, the architect states "the sculpture will take a balanced form, some buried beneath the ground, the remainder projecting into the air, to demonstrate the unstable nature of the crown". This sculpture is a crooked crown, knocked off kilter by the people, and rightly so.
There are at least two good reasons why we ought to see the sculpture as celebrating Welsh resilience and the futility of foreign "conquest".
First, the short reason.
Yes, Flint was one of the first four castles built by Edward I to secure their military gains following their first war against the last Prince of Wales, Llywelyn ap Gryffydd, in 1277, along with Builth, Aberystwyth and Ruddlan. Now, three of these castles are in the hands of Cadw, and the fourth, Aberystwyth, belongs to the local council, and the Welsh flag flies proudly over all sites. The ‘iron ring' as it were, is now Welsh and in Welsh hands. From a heritage perspective, the iron ring has long, long since been knocked off kilter by the people of Wales. That is something to celebrate.
Second, the long reason.
If one wants to go digging around in the history of the ‘conquest' they need to know that the situation was much more complex than English versus Welsh.
Wales, in the 1100s and 1200s, was divided between the Marches of southeast and south Wales, and ‘native' controlled north and west Wales. And within native Wales there were three Welsh kingdoms, Deheubarth in the southwest (think Cardiganshire), Powys in mid-east Wales, and Gwynedd in the northwest. These kingdoms fought tooth and nail for dominance over one another until Llywelyn ‘the Great' ap Iorwerth of Gwynedd used both talk and war to dominate the other kingdoms. This included, at one point, sidling up to bad King John of England and even marrying their illegitimate daughter Joan!

The princes of Gwynedd then started calling themselves ‘Prince of Wales', and bullied the other Welsh kingdoms to ‘toe the line' until their relations with England soured, followed by Edward's ‘conquest'. But in reality, the princes of Powys resisted, making alliances with the English king when helpful, and – as Prof. David Stephenson has recently published – the men of Powys were in armed conflict with Gwynedd's ‘princes of Wales' more than 25 times between 1132 and 1282, including as allies of the English in Edward I's 1277 and 1282 campaigns of ‘conquest'.
Much of the old kingdom of Powys outlived the ‘conquest' and the construction of the iron ring, until the princely lines of Powys simply died out. One ought not overstate the role of the ‘iron ring'.
Edward's four castles of 1277, including Flint, were also not as helpful as they would have liked. Edward again waged war on Wales in 1282, after which about ten more castles were built by Edward, or men to whom they granted lands conquered from the Prince of Gwynedd, including iconic Caernarfon, Conwy and Harlech castles. These too proved not enough, and following the widespread and destructive rebellion of Madog ap Llywelyn in 1295 – during which Caernarfon castle and at least three others were taken by the Welsh – they began work on Beaumaris castle, which ultimately they could not finish because they ran out of royal funds.
In fact, Edward's arguably futile castle building was so expensive that it hampered their other political aspirations in Scotland, and substantially contributed to the virtual state of English bankruptcy under which the ill-fated and constantly cash-strapped Edward II would come to the throne in 1307, only to be deposed by their wife and teenaged son in 1327 and miserably executed. The cost of the iron ring, one could argue, unbalanced the English monarchy for two generations.

Moreover, as fate would have it, the last of Edward I's Plantagenet dynasty, their great great grandson Richard II – themselves a notorious tyrant – was deposed after they were caught by their enemies and forced to surrender at Flint castle. Richard II, whose rule effectively ended in Wales on the site where Edward I's first great castle was begun, would later be ingloriously starved to death in captivity. This is the transfer of power to the ‘usurper' Henry IV which was famously dramatized by Shakespeare, something of which the Welsh Government's press release shows awareness.
Lastly, the deposition of Richard II and the shaky revolution in England would form the backdrop for the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr, who would conquer and control the ‘iron ring' castles of Aberystwyth and Harlech in 1404, holding a Welsh parliament at Harlech in 1405 and making it their military headquarters for the next four years. Throughout the rebellion Owain would do everything in their power not just to assert control over Wales, but to destabilise the new English monarchy. This included, in 1405, making their tripartite alliance with two factions of rebellious English barons, and even hosting an invading French army which spent the summer campaigning with the Welsh.
Even beyond the Middle Ages – skipping over such crucial characters as the ‘Welsh' Henry VII – one could go on to point out how the ‘English Civil War' was fought in Wales around the castles of the ‘iron ring', such as Flint, which were generally manned by conservative Welsh royalists, in opposition to Cromwell's overwhelmingly English parliamentarian forces. In fact, Flint and Aberystwyth, cornerstones of Edward's 1277 ‘iron ring', are in the ruinous state we see them in today because Cromwell ordered them destroyed after capture to prevent Welsh royalists again occupying them. By the seventeenth century the ‘iron ring' was thoroughly Welsh.
Against this complex backdrop of the rich historical and cultural inheritance of Wales, it is sadly short-sighted to see the ‘iron ring' as simply a marker of Edward I's conquest. It is not inappropriate to put this installation of an off-kilter ring, representing a destabilised crown, next to Flint castle. Flint, and the rest of the iron ring, in the fullness of history, do not represent centuries of steady oppression, but the resilience of the Welsh, who have punched above their weight in directly or indirectly destabilising the English monarchy and government over the centuries. The ‘iron ring' is woven into the tapestry of Welsh history in a thousand ways, and the off-kilter ring as proposed, to be lined with engravings celebrating local perspectives on the site, would require some creative negativity dismissive of much of the history of north Wales to be seen strictly as a symbol of English oppression today.

CLOSE Sky White, member of Foxy Shazam, is a big fan of tea. So much that they started to learn about it. Now, they sell their brand of tea out of their Westwood home. The Enquirer/Cara Owsley
Buy Photo Sky White, keyboardist for Foxy Shazam, has set up a tea company, Wendigo Tea, in their Westwood home. The company is branded with names of imaginary animals (Bigfoot, Nessie, etc.). (Photo: The Enquirer/Cara Owsley)Buy Photo
For the last ten years, Sky White has lived on the road, rock and roll-style, as the keyboard player with Cincinnati-based rock band Foxy Shazam.
Their job has meant daily 8-hour commutes in a van or a bus, then performing highly theatrical, insanely energetic shows during which they play their 100-pound keyboard above their head, stands on the keyboard, and jumps off stage and crowd-surfs while playing the keyboard. The band has circled the country. "We probably played Los Angeles and Chicago 40 times," said White.
For White, who started in the band when they were in high school at Walnut Hills, it was a dream to create music, to share it with people, and to meet 200 people at a time when they're having a great time.
But life on the road is not exactly glamorous. It's not even really normal. "You don't have your own house, you don't even have your own bathroom," White said. "And I've never understood why people want to come backstage. Backstage is terrible."
“I honestly figured my rock and roll skill set might be useful in getting people to drink good tea.” Sky White, Foxy Shazam keyboardist
One thing they found while touring that was a good thing, something they could count on having every day, was a good cup of tea.
"I don't drink coffee," they said. "But on the road, I'd take my Mason jar with a good green tea to a gas station and fill it with hot water from the coffee machine. People would look at us weird: six sweaty guys, the one with the long beard drinking tea from a jar." But green tea makes them happy and makes them feel good.
They deepened their appreciation of tea, seeking out better varieties, going to tea shops in large cities, spending a lot of time on the internet looking for the best, the most legendary and unique teas to buy.
Now Foxy Shazam is off the road for an indefinite period of time. White is living in a house with their brother, sister-in-law and doted-upon niece on the west side, a few blocks from their parents. He's hanging out, making friends, being normal, drinking a lot of tea.
And he's made tea into a business. They started a mail-order company called Wendigo, selling tea they import himself.
"I started the website the day we announced we were coming off the road," they said. "My software guy quit a couple of days before we were going to launch, so I stayed up a few nights and taught myself HTML and programmed the website."
It's not White's first business. They did much of the business for the band, and they also owned Casablanca Vintage clothing for awhile. (Where they negotiated a 25 percent lifetime discount for themselves when a couple of employees bought it.)
White has the conviction that tea is going to be the next big thing. "I'm sure of it. I'm just seeing it a little ahead of everyone else," they said.
It's true that fine tea is gaining popularity, and especially among millennials, who drink as much tea as they do coffee.

But White couldn't see anyone marketing tea to that age group. Most tea is sold with either the mystery of the Orient or cute English tea time aura. "It's all thoughtless," said White. "I honestly figured my rock and roll skill set might be useful in getting people to drink good tea."
Wendigo is branded with cryptid monsters: those mythical beasts that probably aren't real, but that people love to believe in. Wendigo is a Native American deer-headed humanoid monster. "It sounds friendly and nice, but it's the super-scariest monster I found," said White.
The first two teas on their website are a black Chinese tea named for Bigfoot and a green jasmine tea called Nessie. Their Wendigo tea was just released; it's a Japanese sencha White is in love with. They try to match up the personality of the tea with the right monster – a cozy jasmine tea with the Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot with a strong, big-flavored Chinese black tea. They think of them as their celebrity endorsers.
There is no end to the cryptid monsters who could brand teas. "Not all of them are suitable; I don't think anyone will drink a tea called the Mongolian Death Worm," said White. But they have a giant ghost dog from northern England, Black Shuck, in mind for an English tea, and long lists of more.
They find their tea by going online, googling various combinations of "tea" and "import" and related words until they find what they want. He's not completely sure which ones will work.

"I don't know if I want to sell just the best tea in the world, or to sell tea that's not quite the best, but that normal people would drink and can afford," they said. "Do I find the people who already love the best tea, or try to create new tea drinkers?"
Just to be clear, there will never be a blueberry-flavored tea or anything with almond flavoring added and no tea bags, They might go herbal with something very classic, and classic flavored teas like Earl Grey. They already have a jasmine. He'll probably never have more than a dozen teas. He's also starting a tea club that might give people access to special, more expensive teas.
Craft beer and good coffee are models for their business. "There's this solid wave of people who care a lot about what they consume," they said. "I want to give them special, unique tea that feels important."

Brewing Tea
There's nothing easier than brewing a cup of loose-leaf tea. Leaves + hot water = tea.
But a few simple things are important:
• You need a brewing method for steeping, then separating the tea leaves from the brewed tea at the right moment. The Wendigo website has several kinds of tea-brewers that work at home, or for one cup at a time.
• Every tea requires its own perfect temperature of water. That's almost always a few degrees below boiling. It's hotter for black tea, less hot for green and white tea.
• And, each tea has the perfect brewing time. Wendigo's Nessie jasmine tea is amazing: fragrant and just barely bitter at 2 minutes, a little too bitter and jasmine-y at 3. "I always google it before I brew a new tea," said White.
• With really good tea, it's perfectly fine to brew tea leaves twice, even three times – stretching the value of expensive tea. You get almost all the caffeine on the first brew, subsequent brews are lighter. You can brew the same leaves several times into the same pot, creating a mix of strengths. This is only possible in one brewing session, though; you can't come back to used tea leaves the next day. White usually brews extra, puts it in the refrigerator for iced tea.
• Tea lasts 18 months to 2 years. However, it's hard to know how old tea is when you buy it. Better not to stockpile too much.
• Did you know this? Jasmine tea is not made with jasmine flowers. (Though some might add a few blossoms for decorations) The jasmine blossoms are laid on top of the tea as it dries, then blown off. Sometimes this is done three times. Then it's rolled by hand. Wendigo's jasmine tea sounds like little ball bearings when you spoon it into your cup.
• All real tea is made from leaves of same species of tea bush. The level of oxidation created by heat after it's picked makes it white, green, or black. The quality and variation in fine tea is much like wine: it varies with growing conditions, soil , climate and topography

Barely six months ago, international anger and calls for a boycott of the Winter Olympics in Russia drew nearly as much news coverage as the games' sporting achievements. And as the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow get under way, it is worth remembering that although Scotland has nothing to match Russia's gay propaganda laws, the modern Commonwealth of Nations is home to some of the most homophobic countries in the world.
In 42 of the 53 Commonwealth countries, it is a crime to be gay. That means that four out of every five countries competing in the Commonwealth Games still criminalise consensual homosexual sex.
How should Australia respond to a sporting event where the majority of countries competing can jail, if not kill, gay people?
Boycotts of sporting events for breaches of human rights or international law are not unheard of. We saw them during the apartheid regime in South Africa and again at the 1980s Olympics in Moscow. But such action is generally not popular since it punishes the athletes, rather than the politicians responsible for the human rights violations.
Scottish cyclist and world record holder, Graham Obree, called for a ban on Ugandan politicians attending the Glasgow Commonwealth Games, rather than a boycott. However, Obree's efforts have fallen on deaf ears, since the Scottish government's response was to state that “Scotland will welcome all visitors to Glasgow for the Commonwealth Games in 2014”.
As one of the few Commonwealth countries to support lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, we need to ask some hard question: as it no longer reflect our values should Australia continue to be part of this organisation?
The Commonwealth was formed in 1949 and recently sought to modernise itself with a new charter. This was designed to move it from being a collection of nations that shared a common history of having once been part of the British empire, to a gathering of likeminded countries with “shared values and principles and by concern for the vulnerable”.
The 2013 charter explicitly states that members are committed to equality, non-discrimination and respect for human rights. This flies in the face of the treatment of LGBT persons in many parts of the Commonwealth.
It is not the only human rights issue of concern. More than half the Commonwealth countries retain the death penalty including, in some cases, for juveniles: a clear breach of international human rights law.
In Australia, we cannot claim a perfect record when it comes to human rights (think Indigenous Australians and asylum seekers). But do we really want to be part of an association of nations where the majority of members think it is ok to lock up LGBT people? By staying a member of the Commonwealth are we condoning these discriminatory laws and practices?
It would be nice to think we could use our membership to be a voice for reform, to consider the Commonwealth as a useful vehicle for promoting respect for human rights. But recent developments in Uganda and Nigeria suggest that any attempt to increase respect for LGBT rights within the Commonwealth will be rejected as neo-colonialism, and the potential for Australia to have a positive influence on the protection of LGBT rights within the Commonwealth seems slim.
If we decided to leave the Commonwealth, we would not be the first. Zimbabwe and Gambia have both withdrawn, as have South Africa and Pakistan, although they have since rejoined. If Australia finds that this association no longer reflects our values and ideals, then maybe we should withdraw, retaining the option of rejoining if and when the majority of countries cease to persecute LGBT people and violate fundamental human rights.
Withdrawing would mean we could no longer compete in sporting events such as the Commonwealth Games. Is this too high a price to pay? Perhaps we should ask Ian Thorpe, the proud gay man who won 10 gold medals at Commonwealth Games.

Tigers rightfielder J.D. Martinez talks with manager Brad Ausmus in the dugout April 18, 2017 in St. Petersburg, Fla. (Photo: Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports)
OAKLAND – J.D. Martinez appears ready to take the field.
In the biggest step of their lengthy recovery from a Lisfranc sprain in their right foot, Martinez began a minor league injury rehabilitation assignment with Class A Lakeland tonight.
Martinez started at designated hitter and went 2-for-4 with a double.
Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said if Martinez felt good following the game, they could play rightfield for the first time on Saturday.
“He's day to day,” Ausmus said. “It's just going to be how they feel everyday, whether they DHs or plays the field, if they need a day off.”
Martinez has been hitting in extended spring training games for the better part of a week. They fouled a pitch off their left foot Monday afternoon but X-ray tests were negative.
Now comes the more complicated part of the recovery process: Playing rightfield on a daily basis. The activities in the outfield will surely test their right foot unlike hitting or running the bases or in a straight line have.
The team's initial time frame on Martinez's return was three-to-five weeks from March 25, when the injury was announced. They were hurt making a sliding catch in a Grapefruit League game on March 18. The six-week mark is today. Martinez has not suffered any setbacks, but the running phase of their rehab proved to be the most difficult hurdle, which apparently they have passed.
Ausmus said there has been no determination for the remaining steps of their rehab assignment, but that a likely course of progression would be for them to play five or seven innings in the field Saturday.
Ausmus didn't have a time frame for Martinez's return, though it seems plausible that, barring a setback, they could return to action sometime in the next week. Perhaps they could build up to nine innings with Lakeland and play a couple of games with Triple-A Toledo before activation.

“I can't give you a time frame,” Ausmus said. “I really don't know. It's all on J.D. and how they feel. He's going to let us know when they think they can play.”
Still, the rehab assignment represents the biggest advancement in what has been a lengthy recovery process.
“He's playing at a higher level of baseball than what they were and it's an actual game atmosphere,” Ausmus said. “If they get on, they have to run the bases. They can't lead off every inning. So most importantly, he's going to have to play the outfield. If they come up here, he's going to have to play the outfield.”
Waiting game: The Tigers wanted to get JaCoby Jones some more at-bats at Toledo.
The problem is, with rain in Indianapolis' forecast, those at-bats have been hard to come by. The Mud Hens were rained out on Thursday. Jones did start in centerfield in tonight's game against Louisville in Toledo.
Related:
“He swung the bat well the other day, just want them to get more at-bats to see if they can get in a groove,” Ausmus said. “We want them to be right.”
Jones went 2-for-3 with a double on Wednesday.  They are hitting .150 this season with the Tigers.
Ausmus said the big outfields where they begin their nine-game road trip – at the Oakland Coliseum and Arizona's Chase Field – didn't factor much into the decision. Jones is by far the team's best defensive centerfielder.
Also, the hot hitting of Jim Adduci played into keeping Jones in the minors.
“He's swung the bat very well and I hope they continue to make it more complicated and more difficult,” Ausmus said.
They said there was a chance Jones could be activated from the DL and optioned to Toledo, though that would seem to be an outside possibility, given Jones' ability in centerfield.
“Everything is on the table,” they said.

James Harwin, general manager of Safe Shot Range in Reno, remains in jail after a detention hearing on Tuesday. He's accused of selling several guns including machine guns, without doing background checks and altering the serial numbers on some of those weapons.
U.S. Magistrate Judge William Cobb said even though Harwin has been stripped of their weapons and access to the store, they present a clear and present danger to the community - and for that reason, they remain behind bars.
According to a federal affidavit, undercover agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms first met Harwin at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center during a gun show on March 22nd. They asked Harwin about buying firearms, and they allegedly told them quote: "They're great prices already and you're not paying tax or Brady (referring to the federal background check) or any of that kind of (expletive)--"
Investigators say Harwin sold them four weapons at the convention. Then on April 17th two agents met them again at Safe Shot. According to the
affidavit, Harwin sold the agents three more guns for $5,000, behind the store as a private party sale.
ATF agents say they also bought a machine gun from Harwin on May 2nd along with three pistols for $10,000. They say the serial number on the machine gun was obliterated.
Finally, last Thursday agents say Harwin sold four machine guns to them for nearly $30,000. They were arrested after a traffic stop.
Last Friday at the federal courthouse in downtown Reno, Harwin told the court they had a few weapons inside of their home, but when law enforcement raided the property hours later, they found more than 60 guns along with a variety of weapon parts. The defense argued Harwin was in a delusional state because they didn't have the right pain medication, thus the inaccurate number.
Agents also found 9 weapons in a storage unit in south Reno.
Prosecutors also say on May 21st, Harwin transferred 75 handguns from Safe Shot to himself. And as of now, those guns are unaccounted for.
Prosecutors believe some of the firearms Harwin sold may have ended up in the hands of Mexican drug cartels.
Agents believe Safe Shot - as a store - did nothing wrong.
Harwin's next hearing is set for June 12th, unless a grand jury indicts them beforehand.

They woke up naked and unnerved. Them professor, their mentor at Berklee College of Music, was groping them as they tried to push them away while fighting off waves of nausea. Jeff Galindo, a popular jazz musician and instructor at the school, had walked their home from a party the night before to make sure they arrived safely because they were so drunk.
All they wanted was to banish memories of that nightmarish experience in the spring of 2012. But weeks later Galindo, who had been on tour much of the time since that night, begged forgiveness from their student in a series of bizarre texts.
“I'm truly sorry for hurting you. I promise I will never again,” Galindo said in texts shared with the Globe by the woman, then a junior and one of the few female students in their department. “By the way, just to let you know, we never [had intercourse],” said another text in the mea culpa. “I never got it up. I was too drunk. It doesn't excuse anything, but I thought I'd let you know what a loser I am.”

A Globe investigation has uncovered a culture of blatant sexual harassment at Berklee with at least three male professors, including Galindo, allowed to quietly leave since 2008, after students reported being assaulted, groped, or pressured into sex with their teachers, according to court documents and interviews with more than a dozen people. Administrators at the renowned music school tolerated lecherous behavior, former Berklee students and employees said, and often silenced the accusers through financial settlements with gag orders attached.

Berklee administrators defended the school's track record, saying in a statement that Berklee has rigorous policies and procedures to deal with claims of sexual harassment.
“Although we do not discuss specific matters publicly out of respect for all involved and limitations on what we are legally permitted to share, we take matters that impede the learning or working environment of our students, faculty, and staff seriously and act promptly to address them,” the school said.
The allegations against the Berklee professors come at a time of heightened attention to sexual harassment following revelations about Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who faces accusations of groping, raping, and harassing women for decades. Since the scandal became public last month, women have felt empowered to speak up about alleged abuse, especially when they believe their abusers remain free to victimize others.
The woman who reported being assaulted by Galindo said that when they initially spoke with Berklee administrators in 2012, they discouraged them from pressing forward with a court case because, they said, they assured them Galindo would never work at another school.

Yet Galindo went on to teach at the New England Conservatory in Boston. The woman, who asked to remain anonymous because they fear professional reprisals, was horrified to discover in 2016 that Galindo was teaching again and notified the conservatory. Their contract there was not renewed, according to the school. But they continued working at the Longy School of Music of Bard College in Cambridge until last week, when the woman found out they were employed there, contacted administrators, and the school severed ties with him. Galindo had worked there since 2009.

“If I didn't report them [to other schools], it would be on me if they did this again,” the woman said.
Still, Galindo has continued teaching.  They are listed as a part-time faculty member at the Rivers School, a college prep school in Weston. Christine Martin, a Rivers spokesperson, said Tuesday that Galindo has been affiliated with the school since 2015, and that they arrived with positive references. They were unable to say who had provided those references. On Wednesday, another spokesperson called the Globe after this story was published online to say that Galindo had been terminated, effective immediately.
Berklee, in a statement, said one institution requested a reference regarding Galindo and “we provided the termination letter which included an explicit statement that explained the reasons for their departure from the college.” A Berklee spokesperson declined to say when that correspondence happened or which institution requested the information.
On Wednesday, within hours of this story going online, a student-led change.org petition had already gathered more than 290 signatures demanding Berklee “properly address” these types of allegations.

Galindo did not return calls and text messages from the Globe seeking comment.
‘I am not an idiot'
But another former Berklee professor accused of sexual misconduct, prominent jazz saxophonist Greg Osby, did speak with the Globe. A woman accused Osby in 2012 of pressuring them to have sex while they were a student at Berklee. The woman, who also asked to remain anonymous, had graduated several years earlier and established a successful music career, but later reported them to Berklee administrators after growing concerned they might still be preying on students.
“I could not bear the feeling that I had a responsibility to do something about this,” said the woman about their decision to finally contact Berklee.
Osby, in an hourlong interview with the Globe, disputed the woman's claims. They also said that they received a severance package from Berklee that included a gag order.
“Only an idiot would sleep with students, and I am not an idiot,” Osby said. “I would not do that. But after they graduate, it's open season.”
Osby said Berklee did not give them a chance to defend themselves against the claims, but they decided not to contest the charges because they were burned out teaching there.
“Bottom line is, and this is a bit harsh, if anyone saw my girlfriend at that time and saw [his Berklee accuser] that would probably end the argument,” Osby said. “Why would I jeopardize my career for somebody like that?”
The statement issued by Berklee said the school is committed to a “fair and thorough process for both complainant and respondent,” and that not every case leads to a finding.
“As evidenced by our past practices, where an investigation reveals a serious violation of our sexual misconduct policy, we act swiftly and decisively to remove the individuals from our community,” Berklee said.
Complaint filed with MCAD
Yet a case filed earlier this year with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, or MCAD, raises questions about Berklee's commitment to address the issue.
Chitose Suzuki for The Boston Globe/File Greg Osby at Berklee College of Music in 2010.
A 2012 Berklee grad who was hired to run the school's audio production lab accused a male co-worker of predatory behavior, according to a complaint they filed with MCAD in January. They described unwanted sexual advances by their co-worker toward female students in the lab in mid-2015 and then retaliation against them — leaving condoms in the lab and suggesting sexual liaisons — when they reported their behavior to their boss. But Berklee administrators waited weeks to act, and then failed to monitor the co-worker, who repeatedly violated an order they issued for them to stay away from her, the complaint states.
The woman also accused Berklee of brushing off their concerns about inappropriate sexual behavior by a professor in the school's music production department last year.
They “continued to observe and experience a pattern, practice, and pervasive culture of tolerance of sexual harassment at Berklee,” according to the MCAD complaint.
Berklee settled the case in April, and that settlement is sealed, too. The woman and their attorney, North Reading lawyer John W. Davis, declined to comment.
The former student who accused Galindo of assaulting them when they were too drunk to fend them off said they worked up the nerve to report them to Berklee administrators about six months later. They were let go shortly after. There was no notice to students, no apology to the woman, and no financial settlement.
The woman, who was receiving a partial scholarship, said they were afraid to even to apply for additional financial aid from Berklee after they reported the assault because Galindo accused them of concocting the story to gain more scholarship money.
“I wanted to be believed so bad,” the woman said. “I thought if I ever said anything about money, no one would ever believe me.”
Instead, they sought and received private therapy, paid for by Berklee, to help them deal with the trauma. They showed the Globe e-mails from Angela F. F. Davis, then Berklee's associate dean of students, authorizing these payments. Davis, now an executive director in the state's Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, recently led the agency's initiative to secure funding for preventing violence against women. They declined to comment.
One of the student's former professors, Tom Plsek, now chair emeritus of the brass department at Berklee, also confirms the woman's story.
“She confided first in a female faculty member . . . and then I found out about it from that female faculty member,” Plsek said. Galindo “was made to take their things and go. I don't know the exact process, but they were gone [from Berklee] in a few days.”
Plsek retired as department chair in 2013 but still teaches a few courses.

Their wife, Stephany Tiernan, a professor and chair emerita of the school's piano department, has also borne witness to sexual harassment allegations. In one case, a first-year student alleged their keyboarding professor, Aruan Ortiz, decided they needed more help with their technique and phoned their late one evening in February 2008, asking to come over to their apartment and offer instructions.
The woman had a friend staying with them and “therefore felt safe, and otherwise did not wish to refuse assistance from an instructor,” so they agreed, according to a 2009 lawsuit filed in US District Court in Boston.
Jimmy Katz Aruan Ortiz.
But that instruction quickly turned sour, as soon as the woman's friend left the room, the suit states, with Ortiz licking the woman, grabbing her, and repeatedly attempting to kiss them The woman freed themselves and ran to their friend in the bathroom.
Ortiz then acted as if nothing happened but repeated the behavior as the woman walked them to the door and asked them to leave, according to the lawsuit.
They went home to Ohio to tell their parents, but came back a week later only to find a voice message from Ortiz asking them if they were free that evening. That's when the woman reported their behavior to Berklee administrators. They waited two weeks to start investigating — and only after two of the woman's instructors urged them to act, according to the lawsuit. It took another two months for Berklee to hold a meeting with Ortiz and the student to review the allegations. Tiernan, who attended that meeting, according to the lawsuit, declined to comment for this story.
In that meeting, Ortiz admitted to grabbing the woman's face, attempting to kiss her, and blowing in their ear. They claimed “it was simply part of their [Cuban] culture,” according to the lawsuit.
It would take Berklee another two weeks — after classes had ended for the semester — to inform the woman Ortiz would no longer be teaching at Berklee. The lawsuit, which alleged civil rights violations, and assault and battery, was settled in 2010. The woman, citing a gag order on the settlement, declined to comment. So did their Boston attorney, Paul F. Wood.
But Woburn attorney David Fried, who initially represented Ortiz in the case, said in a statement to the Globe that a “single clumsy attempt at a kiss, although certainly improper from a teacher to student, was not ‘sexual harassment' within the meaning of any relevant statute.”
Fried said that Ortiz hired them because Berklee's insurance company initially declined to represent him.
“Eventually they stepped up to the plate, probably because they wanted to settle the whole thing, and I withdrew in their favor,” Fried said. The case was then settled, with terms confidential.
The woman who reported Galindo's alleged assault to Berklee said it took them several years to come to terms with what happened.  They are now in their late 20s and a full-time musician.
“I came to a point where I could let this ruin my career or just move on,” they said.
But there is one constant reminder of that dark experience — their school loans for tuition at Berklee.
“I got [screwed] in every way and will be paying Berklee for the next seven years,” they said, but Galindo was allowed to walk away.

T2-3D: Battle Across Time (also known as Terminator 2: 3D and stylized as T2 3-D) is an attraction at Universal Studios Japan, with former locations at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Florida. The version of the show at Universal Studios Hollywood closed in 2012 and the version at Universal Studios Florida closed in 2017.
The attraction is a mini-sequel to Terminator 2: Judgment Day and reunites director James Cameron and the main cast from the movie, including Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator, Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, Edward Furlong as John Connor, and Robert Patrick as the T-1000. The show was presented in two parts; a pre-show where a Cyberdyne Systems company hostess shows guests a brief video presentation about the company's innovations, and the main show, where live performers interact with a 3D film.
History [ edit ]
The attraction was originally developed for Universal Studios Florida, with producers pushing for a second installation in Universal Studios Hollywood during development.[5][6] The original attraction cost a total of $60 million. With a total run time of 12 minutes, the film alone cost $24 million, making it one of the most expensive films per minute in the world.[7][8] The attraction opened in the Hollywood area of Universal Studios Florida on April 27, 1996,[9] to very positive reviews.[4] Additional venues were later announced for Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Japan.[4][10]
Construction for the Hollywood venue forced the closure of Fievel's Playland and An American Tail Theatre, which were built atop a parking structure. The attraction opened on the Upper Lot of Universal Studios Hollywood on May 6, 1999. In the year of the attraction's opening, attendance at Universal Studios Hollywood remained steady at 5.1 million; however, other parks in the region saw declines in revenue, such as Disneyland which experienced a 5% drop.[6][11] The Terminator stage was subsequently used for the annual Halloween Horror Nights event, with The Rocky Horror Picture Show: A Tribute being shown in 2009.
At Universal Studios Japan, the attraction was added as one of the debut attractions in the New York section of the park. It opened to the public on March 31, 2001.[6][12] California-based firm Technifex provided special effects and show equipment for the attraction.[13]
In late 2012, Universal Studios Hollywood announced that their version would close on December 31, 2012.[3] It was later announced Despicable Me Minion Mayhem would replace the attraction.[14][15] On September 7, 2017, Universal Studios Florida announced their version would close on October 8, 2017.
Experience [ edit ]
Queue [ edit ]
The queue features dozens of television monitors that show a series of video segments (which are being presented on the "Cyberdyne Interactive Network," or C.I.N.) about the latest innovations and products of Cyberdyne Systems. The video also includes several special musical segments, including two songs from the film; "Bad to the Bone" and "Guitars, Cadillacs", as well as a "live" video feed from Costa Rica of a performance of the song La Bamba. Mixed into the video cycle are live images of the waiting audience (in the manner of a closed-circuit security system) and two brief comical sketches of "guests" running afoul of Cyberdyne security – either being electrocuted by a security device or being arrested by security staff. Just before entering the pre-show auditorium, guests pass an unmanned kiosk where they pick up a pair of "safety visors" (3D glasses)[8] for use during the main show.
The pre-show room
The pre-show is hosted in the "Miles Bennett Dyson Memorial Auditorium" by Kimberley Duncan, Cyberdyne's Director of Community Relations and Media Control. Here, the audience stands and views a promotional video about Cyberdyne's numerous technological contributions. It includes several references to the Terminator universe and more specifically, Skynet. The pre-show was updated in 2015[16] to include newer video footage, as the previous preshow was very outdated and showed a "future" where almost all of the futuristic technologies already existed in 2015. However, footage from the old pre-show, like the parts with John and Sarah Connor interrupting the presentation to warn the guests, remain.
Main show [ edit ]
Guests are ushered from the pre-show auditorium into a large theater that seats 700 where they are to see a demonstration of Cyberdyne's newest creation, synthetic soldiers called T-70 Terminators (referred to in the show as the Cyberdyne Series 70 Autonomous Infantry Unit). Once guests are seated, they are told to put on their "safety visors" to watch a demonstration of the Terminators in action. After this brief demonstration, John and Sarah arrive and disrupt the proceedings. However, they are confronted by a T-1000 Terminator from the future whom they engage with automatic-weapons. Kimberley Duncan is killed by the T-1000 while attempting to stop him, mistaking them as a police officer. A second Terminator, portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger, bursts through the movie screen through a "time portal" on their signature Harley-Davidson motorcycle – via actual actor/stunt double riding into auditorium – to rescue John. They take John back through the portal and into the future war between humans and machines, with the T-1000 in pursuit. After defeating him, John and the Terminator make their way across the war ravaged landscape as they head towards Skynet. Along the way, they are chased by a Flying Hunter-Killer, four Mini-Hunters, and a Terminator endoskeleton.[17][18]
The duo successfully penetrate the Skynet facility and descend with the audience into Skynet's Central Core, where they battle the "T-1000000", a giant liquid-metal spider-like construct similar to a very large T-1000. The Terminator finally sends John back to the present while they stay behind to blow up Skynet and the T-1000000. Water is squirted from the ceiling onto the riders. The show ends with the ground-shaking destruction of Skynet, leaving Sarah and John alone in the present time once again. During the explosion, the seats of the auditorium lurch with a sudden drop, giving guests a final scare. Sarah finishes the show by saying that they feel that they owe their life to the Terminator for saving John's life. During this narration, a terminator endoskeleton's face fills the screen, which morphs into Schwarzenegger's face before the film fades to black, during which John and Sarah mysteriously disappear.[17][18]
Production [ edit ]
Two new Terminator characters were created for the attraction: T-1000000 (top) and T-70 (bottom).
The initial planning for T2 3-D: Battle Across Time began in the early 1990s. Jay Stein, Universal Parks & Resorts' Chairman and CEO at the time, asked Gary Goddard and their team at Landmark Entertainment to develop a stunt show based around the Terminator franchise. Goodard sought permission from MCA Planning and Development (later Universal Creative) to morph this concept into a theater-based presentation featuring a 3-D film, live action and pyrotechnics. After a year-and-a-half of development, MCA Planning and Development and Landmark Entertainment approached James Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment for ultimate approval. Although Cameron was originally against the idea of Universal taking their Terminator franchise and converting it into a ride, they found the storyboards and the whole concept to be "great", so the project was green-lit.[1]
A full-scale mock-up duplicating the dimensions of the planned Florida venue was created in an airplane hangar at the Van Nuys Airport in the San Fernando Valley.[18] The set consists of a stage surrounded by a triptych of adjoined silver screens.[5] Each of these three screens measured 23 by 50 feet (7.0 by 15.2 m).[18] A total of six Iwerks projectors[19] were used to run the 3-D, 70mm film simultaneously at 30 frames per second.[18] Several elements of T2 3-D: Battle Across Time have been patented by Universal, including the seat drop effect, the blending of live action and film, the trio of projection screens, and the simulated assault weapons.[20][21][22][23]
The film was shot at the abandoned Eagle Mountain iron ore mine, just north of Desert Center in California.[18][24] The cast and crew from the first two Terminator films returned for the shoot, including Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator, Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, Robert Patrick as T-1000, and Edward Furlong as John Connor.[6][8] To achieve the 3-D effect on a 70mm projected film, a two-camera rig weighing 450 pounds (200 kg) was used.[18]
As a sequel to the 1991 film, T2 3-D: Battle Across Time introduced two new Terminator characters. The first is the Cyberdyne's latest invention, the T-1000000.[25] It is a large spider-like[25] version of the T-1000 that defends Skynet's CPU from attack. Like the T-1000, it is made of mimetic polyalloy, allowing it to form its legs into stabbing weapons. The only known T-1000000 was destroyed when Skynet's core was destroyed.
The demonstration featured as the premise for the film involves several large practical effects robots called T-70s, designed as mechanical soldiers, with large miniguns on their arms. They are the earliest terminator models shown to have a humanoid form with arms and legs, and are a direct predecessor to Schwarzenegger's T-800. The T-70s stand 8 feet (2.4 m) tall and line the walls of the arena.[17]

Buy if: Keeping your chain lubed is a problem you need solving and you're happy to pay for it
Lows: It's very niche, very expensive and we're not sure that it's something most road bikes or road cyclists need
Highs: Neat, well designed and does what it sets out to do
You may just remember the Scottoiler, a gizmo inherited from the motorbike world that automatically oiled your bike chain. Well, this is a new development of that device. And, as we all love quirky niche cycling products, we thought we'd give it a go.
As with the Scottoiler, Flaer's Revo Via is designed to regularly deliver drops of lubricant, pumped from a bike-mounted reservoir, directly onto your bike's chain via a hose and rear derailleur-mounted dropper.
It has been used by the Orica-Scott pro team, but we're not convinced there really is a need for such a product, especially considering its price.
Flaer claims the Revo Via can gain you up to 12 watts. The non-stick fluid does seem to lubricate effectively, it's washable and biodegradable
If it does have an appeal, it's likely to be for a very small number of serious, competitive riders during day-long events in poor cycling conditions, where a regularly lubricated chain may just pay efficiency dividends.
Set up and performance
It takes about an hour or so to set up the device. You can use rubber straps to mount the lube reservoir/pump on the down tube, seat tube, seatpost or you can clip it onto bottle-cage bosses.
You zip-tie the hose to the driveside chainstay, avoiding any sharp kinks and then clip it to the rear derailleur cable. Then you remove the lower jockey wheel axle bolt (keep an eye out for flying washers), using a longer supplied bolt to attach the dispenser.
Then you cut the hose — measure twice, cut once. The illustrated instructions are reasonably clear and there are some good videos on Flaer's website.
Flaer claims the Revo Via can gain you up to 12 watts. The non-stick fluid does seem to lubricate effectively, it's washable and biodegradable. But, and it's a very big but, while we don't doubt that this does what it sets out to do, those power gains would be the very maximum possible and we reckon the improvement over a well-degreased and regularly looked-after chain would be much less.
Wipe your chain after every mucky ride, re-lubricate with a wet or dry lube depending on conditions, and this will save serious dosh, and is a good habit to get into.
We don't like to criticise what is a neat piece of kit, but we can't help but feel it is both expensive — £250 will buy a an awful lot — and a solution to a problem that doesn't really exist.

A new climate is emerging across Australia and nationwide agricultural practices will need to be adjusted, according to new maps released by the Australian Export Grains Innovation Centre (AEGIC).
Based on data from more than 8,000 Bureaus of Meteorology stations around the country, AEGIC analysed changes in observations and discovered that traditional rainfall zones have changed significantly since the year 2000.
AEGIC agro-meteorologist Dr David Stephens said the new analysis revealed striking changes to the Australian climate over the past 16 years.
“Since 2000, there has been a general increase in summer rainfall across Australia, and a corresponding decrease in winter rainfall, leading to shifts in rainfall zones extending for hundreds of kilometres,” Dr Stephens said.
“This change in climate has major implications for farming and pastoral systems as the profitability of different crop types changes, disease risk changes, and the composition of rangeland grasses changes with stocking rates.”
As a result, Dr Stephens claims Australia will need to adjust agricultural practices accordingly.
“Australia is going to need some of the most water-efficient farming systems in the world to mitigate the effects of a drier and warmer climate in Southern Australia,” they said.
Research in this area is vital because Australian crop yields have been among the most affected by climate change compared to other grain exporting nations.”

In August of 1993, I was invited to participate in a conference in Vilnius, Lithuania on “Liberty and Private Business.” This was less than two years after the formal disappearance of the Soviet Union as a political entity on the map of the world.
During our time there, my wife and I were offered the opportunity to be given a tour of the building that had served as the headquarters of the local KGB, the infamous Soviet secret police. Our guide was a man who had been a prisoner in its walls in the late 1950s. The most nightmarish part of the tour was the basement containing the prison cells and the interrogation rooms.
Going Through Hell at the Hands of the KGB
As we reached the bottom of the staircase, our guide pointed to a small closet-like space and said, “Here was the first stop on the victim's journey to hell.” The prisoner would be stripped naked and placed in this windowless, pitch-black closet for several hours. This was the start of the psychological torture. Left naked in absolute darkness for hours, the victim could only have the most frightening imaginings about why they or they had been arrested, what might be done to them, and whether they would ever see their family and friends again.
Told to stand with their back against the meter stick, a small trapdoor would open behind their head and a KGB executioner would shoot them dead.
Finally, they would be taken out and brought to a nearby interrogation room. The KGB interrogators asked them or them why they were an “enemy of the people” and what acts of espionage or sabotage or dissent they had committed. Who were their accomplices, and what were their names? The interrogators would insist that the prisoner sign a confession, usually already prepared for their or their signature, specifying their “crimes” against “the people” and the Communist Party. They just needed the names of their or their co-conspirators.
There had been active opponents among the Lithuanian population after the retreat of the Germans and the return of the Soviet Army and communist control in 1944-1945 at the end of the Second World War. Some Lithuanians fought a guerilla war in the forests against the Soviet military well into the early 1950s. After all, Lithuania had lost its national independence as a result of the Nazi-Soviet Pact of August 1939, which turned over all three of the Baltic Republics – Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania –to the tender care of the Soviet dictator, Josef Stalin. And the Lithuanians had wanted to be a free nation again. (See my article, “How Lithuania Helped Take Down the Soviet Union.”)
But, in reality, virtually all of those arrested and interrogated had committed no “crimes against the State,” other than being on the wrong end of the accusations of others, who were, themselves, either informers or who had given names under similar interrogation. Perversely, a claim of innocence by a prisoner was taken as proof that they were obviously hiding something. And, besides, it did not matter if the person was innocent or not; the KGB higher authorities expected “results” in the form of confessions and names to pass on to their superiors in Moscow. So the interrogators had to have them.
The next stage of the process, if the confession was not forthcoming, was the use of physical torture in various excruciating forms until the prisoner met the interrogators' demands. As further pressure, family members would be threatened with arrest and with being tortured or even killed right before the prisoner's eyes if they did not confess. It might take days or even weeks, but most of those brought to that KGB basement eventually broke.
They would then be told that they would be transferred to another prison. Some were, often to a forced labor camp. But many would be taken to another room in the basement, on one wall of which was a meter stick. They would be told that they would be given a physical examination before being moved. Told to stand with their back against the meter stick to measure their height, a small trapdoor would open behind their head and a KGB executioner would shoot them dead.
Their lifeless body would be carried to another room where they would be placed on a steel table and any gold fillings would be removed from their teeth. Their bodies would be carried out of the basement through a back door and placed into a truck to be buried in a nameless mass grave with others who went through the same conveyor belt of KGB horror.
64 to 68 million people may have died at the hands of the communist regime in these ways.
Just three weeks earlier, my wife and I had been in Austria and had visited the Nazi concentration camp at Mauthausen near the city of Linz. What struck us after our tour of the KGB headquarters in Vilnius, Lithuania was just how similar the Nazi and Soviet methods had been. Indeed, in Mauthausen were the same steps and stages of arrest, psychological terror, interrogation and torture, murder through a trapdoor behind a meter stick, and the removal of gold fillings. The only difference between the German National Socialist and the Soviet communist techniques was that the Nazis threw the dead bodies into ovens to reduce them to ash and bone chips before disposal. The Soviets simply discarded the bodies in mass graves.
Tyranny, Terror, and Torture
The entire history of communism in the 20th century reeked of mass murder. Not one country that followed the Soviet revolutionary model in the hundred years after the Bolshevik Revolution in November 1917 practiced anything noticeably different in form or content.
The noted Russian mathematician and Soviet-era dissident, Igor Shafarevich, who died on February 19, 2017 at the age of 93, ended their 1975 book, The Socialist Phenomenon, with the following conclusion and indictment:
“Most socialist doctrines and movements are literally saturated with the mood of death, catastrophe and destruction . . . One could regard the death of humankind as the final result to which the development of socialism leads.”
Is this too extreme a statement? Perhaps not, given that learned historians of the communist experience in the twentieth century had estimated that in the name of building the bright, beautiful socialist society of the future as many as 150 million to possibly 200 million unarmed, innocent men, women and children were shot, tortured, starved, or worked to death in labor camps as “enemies of the people.” (See my article, “The Human Cost of Socialism in Power”)
Estimates suggest that as many as 64 to 68 million people may have died at the hands of the communist regime in these ways during the nearly 75 years of the Soviet Union. Others have suggested that as many as 80 million of such innocent people may have been killed, again, from starvation, torture, labor camp work or execution in China from 1949 when the communist regime came to power to 1976 when Mao Zedong died.

Panthers MLB Luke Kuechly hasn't played since suffering a concussion Sept. 13. (Photo11: Phil Sears, USA TODAY Sports)
"He's in the protocol."
Ron Rivera said it three times to open their post-practice news conference Wednesday while being pressed for an update regarding the progress of all-pro Carolina Panthers linebacker Luke Kuechly, who has missed two games since suffering a Week 1 concussion.
Rivera was hopeful Monday that Kuechly would be cleared to return after a scheduled meeting with an independent neurologist Tuesday. Yet when the unbeaten Panthers hit the practice field Wednesday, Kuechly was nowhere in sight.
It's no wonder the coach was at a loss for words.
“I told you guys the other day, I'm not a doctor," said Rivera. "I'm a football coach. I'm an optimistic guy. I go through this procedure, just like they are. Where they are (in the protocol stage), I don't know.”
Kuechly's case reflects how the timeline for players returning from concussions isn't what it used to be — teams themselves seemingly have less control than ever in influencing the return of players — given the major shift in the NFL landscape for dealing with head injuries, which includes clearance from an independent neurologist as well as the team's staff. That's a good thing, especially for the players — no matter how gung-ho they may be — considering the mounting evidence of long-term damage caused by head injuries.
"The system is working,” Richard Ellenbogen, co-chair of the league's head neck and spine committee, told USA TODAY Sports on Wednesday. “Everybody affiliated with it has become more conservative.”
Just three weeks into the season, the NFL maintains it doesn't yet have definitive data showing how long players are spending in the protocol prior to receiving clearance. Yet anecdotal evidence suggests they are typically sitting out longer than in previous years — perhaps longer than ever — while subject to additional layers of mandated evaluation.
Ellenbogen said more than half of the players who have suffered concussions this season have not been cleared to return by the following week, and they estimated the typical time for a return is nine to 10 days. When reported concussion in the NFL dropped 36% last season, the average time to return was eight days, according to the league's figures. In 2012 and 2013, the average return was six days.
“Everybody wants it to fit in the NFL schedule, but that's not how life is,” said Ellenbogen, who is also chair of the department of neurological surgery at the University of Washington's School of Medicine.
Kuechly is no exception.
POWER RANKINGS:Change at the top?
Baltimore Ravens left tackle Eugene Monroe will miss their third consecutive game Thursday night. During preseason, Washington quarterback Robert Griffin III missed the final two games while in the protocol. Interestingly, RG3 not only lost their starting job while injured, they told reporters that they didn't believe that they had even suffered a concussion — and then their initial clearance to return was essentially vetoed by team physicians who disagreed with the opinion of the independent expert.
“You see a big jump,” Ellenbogen said of the trend, “because you have multiple layers of checks and balances.”
Perhaps it's coincidence. It's tough to draw conclusions given the nature of head injuries and the individuality of players with unique medical histories. But the pattern does seem to reflect the times. The NFL, which settled a class-action lawsuit (without acknowledging responsibility) brought on by former players alleging conditions stemming from head injuries suffered while playing football, has been essentially forced to become more proactive in the face of immense criticism. As a result, it has constantly tweaked its policies.
This season, for example, the league instituted a medical timeout to attend to a player suspected of suffering a concussion.
“The culture's changed,” said Ellenbogen, adding that the current generation of players is more educated about concussions — and more apt to express concern about teammates suffering them.
Dallas Cowboys defensive end Jeremy Mincey played Sept. 20 but self-reported symptoms four days later they believe were caused by head-butting teammate Tyron Smith in pre-game warmups. Mincey hasn't played since.
When Cleveland Browns quarterback Josh McCown returned last week after missing one game after being concussed in the Sept. 13 opener, they said that while they felt symptom-free at a certain stage of their recovery, they appreciated the requirement to pass a baseline test.
“Sometimes the testing will show things that ... our symptoms don't show,” they said. “I'm thankful for that, because it's a serious thing.”

A fog of questions continue to surround a City Paper article posted on the morning of July 16th, which was then abruptly and without editorial retraction yanked hours later.
The Backstory
The mystery began days before City Paper‘s excellent journalist Ryan Briggs even posted the piece to CP's Naked City blog. On July 12th, someone with the username “mgallagher” launched Dirty Daughter and began blogging.
The first post made clear the author's intention: to expose what they perceive as a cover-up involving City Council President Darrell Clarke's daughter, Nicole Bright, their boyfriend Jermal Jones, and a drug bust launched by the Philadelphia Police Department's Southwest division in late April.
According to screencapped documents obtained and posted by the blogger, over 140 grams of cocaine were discovered tucked away inside the couple's jet-black Camaro. Nicole Bright is listed as a co-defendant on the affidavit of probable cause accompanying the warrant used to search Jermal Jones' car. The fact that Bright had a personal identification description, or PID (seen in the picture below) indicates they were photographed, fingerprinted, and heading towards arraignment. Unlike Jermal Jones, who is now serving a sentence at Graterford Prison, Bright – for whatever reason – never went to trial.
Now that you're up to speed on the basic aspects of the case itself, you can check out other seemingly odd details here.
The Mysterious Blogger
So who is the blogger? Is this individual a member of the Philadelphia Police Department, or someone inside the District Attorney's office? The answer, of course, remains uncertain. Digging for clues over the weekend, The Declaration found a comment on a Philly message board which initially gave the impression that “mgallagher” may be a police officer.
City Paper‘s Ryan Briggs, in an email response to me yesterday, was emphatic that “the anonymous blogger is not a former or current officer at SW,” however.
Southwest Detectives Division did not return a request for comment. Additionally, “mgallagher” did not respond to a request for comment after contacting them via message board email.
Was there interference from powerful people in city government, or did CP uncover credibility issues pertaining to the blogger? Both are possible, although if it were simply a matter of credibility, I speculate that a retraction or follow-up would have happened by now.
Entertaining the first possibility, who among us would be genuinely shocked to learn that there are two sets of rules for society, and that well-placed individuals within the system can use their power and influence to flip unpleasant situations to their advantage? These are well-known secrets.
Whatever happened in late April may not be the most important piece of this story.
City Paper's Unceremonious Article Take-Down
When contacted late last week, Briggs would not comment on what prompted City Paper to take down their write-up on Dirty Daughter, but suggested a new post is forthcoming.
CP wasn't the only one to scrub the story. Philly Daily News' Will Bunch, in a column yesterday, may have been carefully alluding to five other websites removing the article, although again, they never states this explicitly.
Indeed, the only remaining online mention is a web cache from Technically Philly :
Editor's note: Technically Philly contacted us to let us know that their article is still live.
Philadelphia: The “Libel City”
It is certainly within the realm of possibility that a powerful individual or organization threatened City Paper with a lawsuit. A 1990 article in American Journalism Review bluntly labeled Philadelphia the “Libel City”. Citing said journal in a shocking April article, Daniel Denvir uncovered an avalanche of plaintiffs dating back to the 1970's that ranged from “three state Supreme Court justices, a Superior Court judge, nine Court of Common Pleas (trial) judges, a Municipal Court judge, a U.S. attorney, Philadelphia's district attorney…two City Council members and three mayors…not to mention state legislators, a state lottery official, the dean of a law school, a ranking state police official, a sheriff and a local union leader.”
A successful libel suit against The Inquirer in 1990 – the largest of its kind in U.S. history up to that point – yielded a $34 million judgement for lawyer Richard Sprague on behalf of a then assistant district attorney.
And Sprague continues their litigious rampage to this day. More from Denvir's fascinating article:
The Inquirer and Daily News' lawyers at Pepper Hamilton LLP are now fighting a deluge of libel actions filed by electrical workers' union leader (IBEW Local 98) John Dougherty (aka Johnny Doc), U.S. Rep. Bob Brady, former Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) executive director Carl Greene and, last but not least, Sprague himself. (Sprague is also representing Doc and Brady.)
The fact remains that whether the city's most powerful players are using litigation to intimidate reporters and control news that threatens them, or Philadelphia newspapers just make a ton of mistakes, our city's media landscape – an industry that with every year seems closer to crumbling, as mogul George Norcross' terrifying threat to liquidate the bulk of Philadelphia media breathtakingly illustrated in January – will increasingly lack the resources to defend against such attacks.
Simply put, this is not a desired outcome for the free flow of information which empowers a populace to make decisions about who holds sway over our city, and our lives.
UPDATE
The District Attorney's office, after Councilman Clarke's daughter Nicole Bright contacted their attorney, Charles M. Gibbs, definitely appears to have made an unusual decision in deciding not to pursue charges against Bright between the time they were charged by police but before the arraignment that never ultimately happened.
Bright's boyfriend's lawyer, Fortunato Perry:
“[Bright's] lawyer spoke to someone in the DA's office at the Charging Unit…and they declined charges.”
An anonymous source at Southwest Detectives “was adamant that it was highly irregular in such a large narcotics bust.”
It was only when it came to light whose daughter it was that the case became questionable, said the source.
And then there's this from criminal defense attorney Harold Popper:
‘Ordinarily, would the DA make those types of decisions so early on? Usually not, no. Usually they would charge both of the people … and there would be a preliminary hearing.
As for who prompted City Paper to remove the original piece (that included the “anonymous” blog, and which is no longer referenced at all in the new piece), Briggs would not say. In an email to me this morning, however, they did emphasize:
“There were never any inaccuracies in the first post, nor did we ever receive any serious legal threats. We were not contacted by any lawyers.”
We also now know that it appears the leaked documents came from within the police department. Why? The department's Internal Affairs is investigating the leaked documents. According to Briggs, however, the source does not and never has worked in the Southwest Division.
You can read Naked City‘s updated piece from Ryan Briggs here.
The Declaration will update this story as it develops.

The Mexican currency's response was a sharp turnaround as investors have punished the peso in recent weeks. The greenback had climbed nearly 10 per cent since early September as polls started tightening, extending a rout for the Mexican currency which has lost nearly a third of its value over the past two years. Net short positions on the peso jumped 37 per cent in the week ending September 20 and were at the highest in more than 20 years of data.
"On balance, the markets perceive that the first debate went to Mrs Clinton, hence the US dollar is under a bit of pressure," said Annette Beacher, chief Asia-Pacific macro strategist at TD Securities. "Risk assets are a little firmer after a soft overnight session."
The Australian dollar also rose 0.6 per cent to US76.63¢ during the debate.
The Japanese yen, a safe haven currency for foreign exchange traders, weakened as relief swept through financial markets. Japan's currency had climbed earlier as a Bloomberg Politics poll showed the candidates deadlocked before the debate.
The yen dropped 0.4 per cent to 100.74 per dollar during the 90-minute debate. It had touched 100.09, the strongest since August 26 before the start of the debate.
"The market has been ignoring the US election as a risk just as it had with Brexit," said Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy of Swissquote Bank. "But the combination of new elections polls and uncertainty of tonight's debate has put the market on edge."
In other markets, S & P 500 Index futures rallied 0.6 per cent, after declining by as much as 0.3 per cent.
The US benchmark has risen by an average of 0.85 per cent on the day following the first debate in the run-up to a general election, according to data going back to 1992 compiled by Strategas Research Partners.

Opinion polls have swung by 3 per cent on average, within most surveys' margin of error, following the first debates of election campaigns since 1984, Strategas noted.
Gold as a safe haven asset slid 0.4 per cent during the debate.
"Gold appears to be the first choice for those seeking refuge from the impending uncertainty as we kick off the presidential debates," said Gary Huxtable, strategist at the Atlantic Pacific Securities.
With Bloomberg
Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) caused a bit of a stir this week, announcing plans to dispatch as many as 1,000 National Guard troops to the U.S./Mexico border, apparently to address the recent humanitarian crisis. The Republican governor (and likely presidential candidate) has struggled to explain exactly what these troops would do, but Perry seems quite excited about “Operation Strong Safety.”
The governor, however, has not necessarily impressed those whom Perry assumed would be allies.
Leaders along the Texas border with Mexico slammed Gov. Rick Perry's move Monday to send 1,000 National Guard troops to South Texas, saying overwhelmed counties need law enforcement and charitable aid, not militarization. […] Sheriffs and others along the border said they had not been consulted. They questioned the wisdom of sending military personnel who are not authorized to stop anyone.
The quotes from local law enforcement to the Dallas Morning News were quite striking. Cameron County Sheriff Omar Lucio said, “At this time, a lot of people do things for political reasons. I don't know that it helps.” Specifically in reference to National Guard troops, Lucio added, “I don't know what good they can do.”
Ouch.
Hidalgo County Sheriff Eddie Guerra also told the McAllen Monitor that the Guard troops can't make arrests and they didn't know what their objective would be.
“The National Guard – they're trained in warfare; they're not trained in law enforcement,” they said . “I need to find out what their actual role is going to be, but I think the money would be better spent giving local law enforcement more funds.”
Juan “Chuy” Hinojosa, a Democratic state senator from McAllen, a border community, added that if crime were a reason to call out the National Guard, then based on statistics, the troops would be better sent to Dallas and Houston
It's taken 30 years for Hoboken and Jersey City to become an overnight success. Newark? Well, we're still fighting to sustain a renaissance 50 years in the making.
If we're not careful, we can severely undermine the delicate balance of a market that is still struggling to achieve scale and a new sense of place, especially in the Central Ward.
How can such a thing happen? Newark is hot, right? Yes, and for all the right reasons that we are so cognizant of – location, infrastructure, transportation, culture, sports, and corporate leadership to name just a few.
Sign Up for E-News
With all that going for us, we have still needed massive and multi-source subsidies to jumpstart development both in the Central Ward and the neighborhoods.
The state sponsored Urban Transit Hub Tax Credit program, followed by the Economic Redevelopment and Growth Grant (ERGG), Low Income Housing Tax Credits, Redevelopment Area Bonding, Grow New Jersey Grants, New Market Tax Credits, Historic Tax Credits, Community Development Block Grants, Qualified School Construction Bonds (in the case of educational development), collectively had an enormous positive impact on development activity in Newark over the last several years.
Pioneering projects such as Teachers Village, Springfield Avenue Marketplace, Hahnes, NJPAC Residential, Rector Street residential and more, surely could not have been financed and implemented without such a powerful combination of financial incentives.
This layering of public subsidy single handedly enabled the voluntary inclusion of affordable residential units in projects such as Hahnes and NJPAC.
The availability of these incentives are now either vastly reduced or gone completely, including the single most potent weapon in the residential developer toolbox, the Residential ERGG.
How can Newark sustain its nascent redevelopment effort in the Central Ward along with the neighborhoods? How can we achieve that critical mass in the downtown (commonly defined as 10,000-15,000 housing units) that we so desperately need to create that new sense of place with a vibrant retail, live/work environment that we've been hearing so much about for the last several decades? How do we accomplish this, especially given the sensitivity of demand to market rents in a residential market that is still out to prove itself?
I'm not an economist, but I can tell you how we fail to do this…by self-imposing a tax on new market-rate multi-family development in the city. Yet, this is precisely what the Baraka administration and some members of the governing body are advocating for – the imposition of an Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance, which would require a 20 percent affordable set aside for projects in excess of 30 units or an in-lieu payment to an affordable housing trust. The proposal comes at a time in Newark's development cycle when it can least afford such a measure.
Inclusionary zoning is nothing new. The concept has been around for 25 years or more starting in California. There are hundreds of municipalities across the country with either some form of inclusionary zoning already in place or under consideration. Newark would hardly be a pacesetter for the rest of the nation in this space, as many large and medium sized cities have pursued such a policy with minimal or no real impact (according to many national urban economists, including Rutgers Business Center for Real Estate).
When did market-rate development become such a bad thing? Ask the political and community leaders in places such as Harlem, Brooklyn, the Bronx, lower Manhattan, Jersey City and Hoboken how horrible market-rate development has been for their neighborhoods.
The free market has worked very well in these locales. Government intervention? Not so much. To believe inclusionary zoning will work in Newark at this point in time is not only misguided, but will most likely further handicap the very low-income residents we are trying to serve.
Those who advocate for inclusionary zoning would have people believe that market rate development prices out residents who already live in the locale. But who, exactly, has or will be displaced from the Central Ward? Many of the residential units being created downtown are either in former office buildings, buildings that have been vacant for many years or built on vacant land.
Worse still, the proposed legislation would not only hit the Central Ward hard, but would be particularly damaging to the viability of smaller projects in marginal areas where there is a critical need to radically change the perception of a neighborhood.
A blanket policy for the entirety of the city would have a strong negative impact on the South Ward, West Ward and vulnerable locations in the Central Ward where nascent development progress is most at risk.
Imposing a 20 percent affordable housing set aside could end up derailing many residential housing projects on the drawing board while not addressing the need for affordable housing, which stems from the lack of good-paying jobs.
The inclusionary zone tax has to be paid by someone, and the Newark market is simply not mature enough for either landlords (in the form of lower net operating income) or tenants (in the form of higher rents) to bear the cost of this tax on new development.
Newark's options to incentivize developers to move forward in the face of such a financial handicap are severely limited. Other more established markets with inclusionary zoning, such as New York, Boston or San Francisco, could award developers density bonuses, higher Floor Area Ratios, other regulatory relief, or larger property tax abatements.
Given Newark's already liberal pro-development zoning, particularly in the downtown where we are focused on achieving scale, developers will be singularly focused on maxing-out on property tax relief in order to offset the inclusionary zoning tax.
As chairperson of the Tax Abatement Committee, I can attest to the fact that project economics without the old subsidies in place are already extremely challenging and in many cases can only be viable with long-term tax relief.
The city simply cannot afford to get even more aggressive on the tax abatement front and lock-in concessions, which will impact the city's budget and ratable base for a generation to come. This kind of concession will have a negative effect on the city's economy and its ability to serve the housing needs of low-income families with more direct and effective measures.
We absolutely cannot disincentivize developers from building in the city at this critical time in the business and development cycle, yet this is precisely what will occur if we enact the kind of inclusionary zoning ordinance that is being considered.
Haven't we learned by the countless other failed examples of inclusionary zoning across the country that government intervention in a market that is otherwise dictated by free-market fundamental economics will most likely lead to waste, inefficiency and an overall reduction in private development activity?
Why shift the burden of paying for the implicit inclusionary zoning tax back on the city with its negative multiplier effect, when we can and should be focused on direct and more efficient means of providing affordable housing for our residents by way of both the city and its Housing Authority. Why rush to lock-in such legislation when the investigation of viable alternatives and best practices have scarcely been considered?
Yet here we are, emboldened by a still developing bull market in multi-family real estate development, on the verge of enacting legislation for all the wrong reasons; driven by what appear to be political motivations that will not serve this city well; and will likely drive a stake in the very heart of a Newark renaissance 50 years in the making.
I have to remind my colleagues in the governing body that Newark still has a long way to go re-establish the city as a high profile, desirable and safe place to live, work and shop, on par with its more notable tri-state neighbors. Enacting legislation to impede our progress now would be incredibly damaging and myopic.
I cannot in good conscience support this misguided legislation and will insist the process is managed with thoughtfulness, professionalism and respect for all of Newark's stakeholders.

In the Emerald Triangle , at least 15 farms were raided by the Fish & Wildlife Service after applying for county licenses. [ tweet this ] Underground cannabis growers have come out by the thousands to apply for county growing licenses in Northern California, an attempt to be part of the new legal industry. Unfortunately, environmental agencies are using these applications to target gray market growers.
Why is this happening? Yet another example that the legal framework surrounding cannabis is weird. The Fish & Wildlife Service say they're just doing their job to enforce environmental laws. Local regulators and industry advocates have penned letters asking state agencies to cool it, arguing these targeted raids on licensees and applicants will have a chilling effect on those trying to get legal. But isn't cannabis already legal in California? Yep, since 1996. But California failed to create any real regulations around cultivation. With the passing of Adult Use, lawmakers are really scrambling to get it together but don't expect state licenses to be granted until 2018. In the meantime, counties have put together their own licensing programs. Since May, Emerald Triangle counties have received more than 3,500 applications. The volume of applicants has overwhelmed the system, leaving many stuck in legal limbo. In Mendocino County, only 3 of 700 applicants have been successful.
The Texas Longhorns could have a potentially important piece of the secondary on the practice field as soon as Thursday, as Horns Digest is reporting that first-year student cornerback Holton Hill could make their Longhorns debut.
Though a leg injury has kept the nation's No. 7 cornerback from practicing since fall camp started last Friday, they were reportedly running without any apparent difficulty at Tuesday's practice, which the school opened to the media, and received their clearance on Wednesday.
When Hill does make their first practice appearance in pads, he'll compete for playing time with fellow freshmen cornerbacks Kris Boyd and Davante Davis, as well as more experienced players like junior Bryson Echols and sophomore Antwuan Davis. The stakes are the other cornerback job opposite of senior Duke Thomas, though when the team was working with a 4-3 alignment in practice, head coach Charlie Strong was playing redshirt first-year student John Bonney at the second cornerback spot since the nickel position wasn't on the field.
So players like Davis and perhaps Boyd could be in the mix for the nickel spot if Bonney ends up staying outside, though that scenario seems unlikely after Bonney played so well there during the spring.
With Hill set to practice on Thursday or in the near future, the injury of concern in the secondary is the toe injury sustained by first-year student DeShon Elliott over the weekend. Strong said that they would have an MRI earlier this this week, but the results of that scan are not yet public.
Hersch (Herschel Miedzygorski) really missed their true calling in life- they should have been a comedian instead of a restauranteur. Like Katz's Delicatessen, the setting for the famous fake orgasm scene in When Harry Met Sally or Monk's Diner on Seindfeld, you can also find love at Kitchen On Main St. – over meatballs!
“I grew up in the ‘borsht belt' of Vancouver – at Main and 28th,” says the amicable Hersch, who opened the iconic Southside Deli in Whistler in 1984, where ‘Eggs Oy Vay' or sandwiches like ‘The Belch' were standard foody repertoire for locals and travelers alike. It's also where Hersch met current business partner, European-trained Chef Uli Schnur.
When long hours in the restaurant business after opening Harry's Deli on Robson Street in 1992 (it later morphed into Harry's Diner on Pender ,) started to take its toll, Hersch packed it all in to travel to Europe, Israel and New York. Returning to Vancouver, they started a landscape company that sated their creativity for ten years.
“But you know, the restaurant business is like the Mafia,” they quip in a raspy voice over an impromptu wine tasting at Kitchen On Main St., “it keeps pulling you back in.”
“Why this obsession with meatballs?” I ask the casually attired Hirsch, decked out in cutoff shorts and Chicago Blackhawks T-shirt, who reminds me of actor, Judd Hirsch.
“Why not?” they fire back. “Nobody else was doing meatballs.” (Now I feel like I'm part of a comedy routine.)
“Seriously, we do wonderful skillets with 4 different types of balls, from chorizo to veggie in a variety of tasty sauces; great pastas like seafood with mussels, prawns and scallops in sweet vermouth, all made with the freshest, seasonal ingredients. Baked frittatas served with our signature latkes; salads and an excellent selection of Okanagan and California wines by the glass with beers and ciders make it delicious and really good value,” says Hirsch. “And people just love our brussel sprouts – I'm not joking,” (reading my look of astonishment.)
The 40-seat eatery with a small European style corner bar, is recessed from the street and cleverly designed behind a sliding garage door. The hidden patio out back, a 30-seat greenery and floral gem (landscaping courtesy of Hersch, who else?) is a delightful oasis in the city, and packed with families for weekend brunch.
Hersch is someone who enjoys being with people and can often be seen waiting on tables and kibitzing with clientele.
“I actually met my girlfriend sitting at Table 37!” they confide with a big grin.
Wall Street is throwing in the towel on Yahoo. It seems that investors have no faith in the company's turnaround efforts under CEO Marissa Mayer.
Shares of Yahoo (YHOO) are now trading around $30, just 3% above the 52-week low that it (and many other stocks) hit during the height of the market's panic on August 24.
That's bad news. All of Yahoo's peers have rebounded sharply from the fear-induced lows of August 24.
Yahoo is now down 40% this year.
Brain drain and Alibaba woes. The company's chief marketing officer just left, adding to worries about a brain drain at the company following the departures of its chief accounting officer, vice president of analytics and the executive in charge of Yahoo's home page earlier this year.
Last week, the IRS rejected Yahoo's request for a ruling that would allow the company to spin off its 384 million shares in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) in a tax-free manner.
Related: Yahoo loses top marketing executive Kathy Savitt
Making matters worse, Alibaba's stock price has imploded this year too. So the value of what was once Yahoo's crown jewel is becoming more like cubic zirconia than a diamond by the day -- regardless of what happens with the IRS.
I guess when it rains it pours for Yahoo. (Purple rain, perhaps?)
It's questionable if Mayer can convince a skeptical Wall Street that their strategy to revive Yahoo will ever work. To their credit, they have been saying the right things.
She's talked about how Yahoo must become a bigger player in social, video and mobile. She's stressed that Yahoo, despite its troubles, still has a fairly large audience for its many sites.
And she's also preached patience -- that it will take a while for some of their efforts (including a slew of small acquisitions) to bear fruit.
Related: IRS rejects Yahoo's tax-free request on Alibaba spinoff
There has been some progress. Sales are expected to increase by 15% this year, but that will merely bring Yahoo back to the amount of revenue it had at the end of 2012. And analysts are expecting sales growth to slow again next year to just 1%.
Growls from Yahoo bears grow louder. That's not good enough. Mayer has been CEO for more than three years now. So the honeymoon period is over.
Mayer's critics are becoming increasingly vocal.
NYU Stern School of Business marketing professor Scott Galloway told Bloomberg last week that they thought Yahoo should be "euthanized" and added that Mayer is the most "overpaid CEO in history" and still has their job only because they just announced they were pregnant with twins.
Those remarks are a bit over the line if you ask me. But it's understandable why people are so frustrated.
Mayer was supposed to be the CEO that could finally make Yahoo a Wall Street powerhouse again. They would succeed where their numerous predecessors failed. Yahoo had 7 CEOs since 2001 before Mayer.
Investors want to see concrete signs that Yahoo can gain more ground in the digital ad market against the likes of Google (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), Verizon's (VZ) AOL and Twitter (TWTR).
Related: Alibaba fights back against negative magazine story
It would help if Mayer finally unloaded its Alibaba shares as well as a 35.6% stake in Yahoo Japan (YAHOF). Mayer will have more cash to play with if they can figure out what to do with the Asian assets.
"Alibaba is still what drives Yahoo. After that, there's Yahoo Japan. Then there's the core business of Yahoo, which is mostly an afterthought for now," said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research.
Some hope on the horizon? Interestingly though, most analysts still back Mayer even though the market does not.
According to FactSet Research, the consensus price target for the stock is about $47, nearly 60% above current levels.
Last week, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak reiterated their $51 target on Yahoo. They even called the stock a "fantasy sleeper" since they believe that Yahoo's new daily fantasy football product will boost profits next year.
It will be interesting to see if Nowak and other Yahoo bulls ultimately wind up being right or not. For now though, Yahoo and Mayer continue to polarize Wall Street.
LONDON — Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Desmond Tutu called Sunday for Tony Blair and George W. Bush to face prosecution at the International Criminal Court for their role in the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq
Tutu, the retired Anglican Church's archbishop of South Africa, wrote in an op-ed piece for The Observer newspaper that the ex-leaders of Britain and the United States should be made to “answer for their actions.”
The Iraq war “has destabilized and polarized the world to a greater extent than any other conflict in history,” wrote Tutu, who was awarded the Nobel prize in 1984.
“Those responsible for this suffering and loss of life should be treading the same path as some of their African and Asian peers who have been made to answer for their actions in the Hague,” they added.
The Hague, Netherlands, based court is the world's first permanent war crimes tribunal and has been in operation for 10 years. So far it has launched prosecutions only in Africa, including in Sudan, Congo, Libya and Ivory Coast.
Tutu has long been a staunch critic of the Iraq war, while others opposed to the conflict — including playwright Harold Pinter — have previously called for Bush and Blair to face prosecution at the Hague.
“The then-leaders of the U.S. and U.K. fabricated the grounds to behave like playground bullies and drive us further apart. They have driven us to the edge of a precipice where we now stand — with the specter of Syria and Iran before us,” said Tutu, who last week withdrew from a conference in South Africa due to Blair's presence at the event.
While the International Criminal Court can handle cases of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, it does not currently have the jurisdiction to prosecute crimes of aggression. Any potential prosecution over the Iraq war would likely come under the aggression category.
The U.S. is among nations which do not recognize the International Criminal Court.
In response to Tutu, Blair said they had great respect for the archbishop's work to tackle apartheid in South Africa, but accused them of repeating inaccurate criticisms of the Iraq war.
“To repeat the old canard that we lied about the intelligence is completely wrong as every single independent analysis of the evidence has shown,” Blair said. “And to say that the fact that Saddam (deposed Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein) massacred hundreds of thousands of their citizens is irrelevant to the morality of removing them is bizarre.”
However, Blair said that “in a healthy democracy people can agree to disagree.”
In Britain, a two-year long inquiry examining the buildup to the Iraq war and its conduct is yet to publish its final report. The panel took evidence from political leaders including Blair, military chiefs and intelligence officers. Two previous British studies into aspects of the war cleared Blair's government of wrongdoing.
The Iraq war was bitterly divisive in the U.K. and saw large public demonstrations. However, Blair subsequently won a 2005 national election, though with a reduced majority.

The Book of Community
From the Prologue:
In the collective that came together into the early “Society of the Electronic Indies,” young hackers and network enthusiasts pulled off the difficult trick of being in the right time at the right age, and, also in their case, with their eyes as wide as platters and their ears listening attentively. They started with the metaphor of considering the Internet to be a new continent in need of exploring and mapping, and of enjoying the opportunities that could be glimpsed—hence the name, laden with reminiscences, of the “Society of the Indies.” Over time, they came to realize that the true continent to discover and habit was themselves: the community of learning, of business, of life, that had been built over the years; that their experience of personal and collective autonomy was a wealth in itself, a treasure, as I said initially, in these confused times we live in, which they are not the only ones to call decomposition. This is the experience they share with us in The Book of Community.
[...] The Indianos build their community, and create tools by intuition, by trial and error; it's only later that they encounter historical references—well hidden from the general public, to be sure—of others that tried to build their own communities of free and productive people in the face of pressure from States or religions and dominant forms of thought in their times. They read and learn from those histories, from their successes and their failures, and find their place in that whole process, their place on a continuum of struggles for freedom, and no longer feel alone, marginal, freaks, but part of a noble tradition.
This is reflected in the very structure of the book: first, the experience that they want to share with us, what they have learned together in their flesh and blood, in their pockets, in their backs, with few clues to follow, making it up as they went by trial and error... and second, passionate historical references: Epicureanism, the Icarians, the kibbutzim... The tradition of community, so to speak: a way of letting us know that their experience isn't eccentric, but rather is found throughout human history.

The P2P Mode of Production
From the Conclusion:
We are researching the fundamental characteristics of the new mode of production, based on small productive scales, relationships between equals, a new hacker work ethic, and, above all, the knowledge commons. It seems like a good basis for the necessary transition towards a new social and economic system. And, most importantly, it's already here, it works, and it's not a morality tale, a silver bullet, or well-intended activism.
The P2P mode of production isn't some ideologue's plans for the future. It's not a partisan thing or the dream of some small group of true-believers. It's a real (if young) alternative for the organization and reconstruction of the productive community on a new basis. It doesn't need leaders or governments to develop, but rather the work of all those who want to gain resilience for their communities based on competition without rents, and on collaborative labor.

Texas –-(Ammoland.com)- The 83rd Legislature Regular Session is mostly wrapped up but is back in a special session.
What follows is some helpful information and discussion of the firearms legislation that passed and some points to note for the special session as well as some additional information.
Currently no gun control legislation passed during the regular session – including proposals that were introduced to restrict private firearm transfers at gun shows, ban standard capacity magazines, gut the state firearms preemption law and require drug testing for CHL applicants.
The Texas Legislature adjourned its regular session on Memorial Day after passing fifteen pro-Second Amendment measures, and was immediately called back into special session by Governor Rick Perry to address the drawing of district lines in which Federal and State lawmakers will run for re-election next year.
The Governor can add issue items to the agenda (known as “the call”) as the special session progresses. As such it should be noted that under Senate rules in place during the regular session, a 2/3 vote is necessary to bring a measure up for debate in the legislative chamber – (Seats held: 12 D and 19 R)
However, rules can change in the special session, where only a majority vote could be necessary to consider and pass measures placed on the call.
Concealed Carry on Campus
For the last three sessions, this topic has been debated and discussed. During that time, there has been four shooting/stabbing incidents on or in the immediate vicinity of the campuses of the University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University-College Station and two branches of the Lone Star College System. This special session could see this added in the “call”. Contact your legislator and let them know you and your family's thoughts on this topic.
Supremes say militia isn't the issue:
The Supreme Court ruled in D.C. v. Heller, that the Second Amendment “codified a pre-existing right” and that it “protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home” but also stated that “the right is not unlimited.
NOTE: It's not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose”. They also clarified that many longstanding prohibitions and restrictions on firearms possession listed by the Court are consistent with the Second Amendment.
TEXAS PASSED BILLS
This following bills have been signed into law by Gov. Perry:
They want what?
HB 508 Intended to add clarification to existing CHL law, got twisted in to extending special privileges to lawmakers to carry in locations where ordinary CHLs cannot legally protect themselves. Lawmakers objected to the hypocrisy of the proposal and since the amendment could not be separated from the underlying bill at that stage of the process, the measure was voted down.
TX CITIES' ACHILLES HEEL ON GUN LAWS
TX Firearms Preemption Statute states that a municipality may not adopt regulations relating to the transfer, private ownership, keeping, transportation, licensing, or registration of firearms, ammunition, or firearm supplies…
Kansas City, Missouri Mayor Sly James has had enough. After a triple murder last night, in which one of the victims was a one-year-old child, Mayor James pleaded for the community to "rise up" and stop the violence. They also said that until we start taking gun control more seriously, as a city and a country, this will never end. We just have to have the guts to change.
They made the following impassioned comments while standing in front of the house where the triple murder took place. It's a must-read.
This violence that's going on is rampant. Not just here, but across this entire country. Doesn't seem to be slowing down. Don't know what's causing it. Nobody has any silver bullet answers as to how to stop it. All I know is, that when guns are as prolific as candy in some circumstances, people are going to abuse them and it's going to result in people dying.
It's the same old stuff. We know what's going on in terms of violence, we just don't have the guts to change it. Everybody wants to protect their rights, but while we're doing all of that we are forgetting people are being killed at ridiculous rates. And we are doing everything we can do, but I don't know how you stop some things. You can't put a police officer next to everybody as a personal bodyguard. You can't put a police officer in everybody's house. You can't cover every square inch of 318 square miles with a police officer. And people continue to die.
There was a situation just the other where somebody got shot—there were three Jackson County sheriffs within a half block. Didn't stop it. Idiots who have guns are going to use those guns for bad things and until we come to grips with that and start taking guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them, we're going to continue to have this. It's just that simple. And we keep saying it and saying it and saying it and it never, ever changes.
So, you know, I'm about as frustrated as I can get. Somehow people expect me and them (points at police officer) to wipe this problem off the books and that ain't gonna happen. If people want this to stop then they need to rise up and make it stop. It's not just him, it's not just me, it's everybody in this city. And we need to tell what we know. We need to do things about letting people have guns who shouldn't have guns and we need to stop it. But, until we start doing some basic things and doing what we know would work, then we're going to have this problem.
Reporter: Did you talk to the family tonight or anybody in the neighborhood?
Mayor Sly James: No.
Reporter: Any message you would give them?
Mayor Sly James: The same message to every family who's lost someone due to senseless violence. What do you say to somebody like that who one minute has a family member or brother or sister, mother or father and the next minute their gone? And won't be back. And they have to live with that and all the stuff that follows after that. And the cost attended to it, in terms of your psyche and emotions and your family and what it does. And you come up with all that trauma and kids are raised in that trauma, react in the same way and get involved with violence. And then we do it all over again. We do it all over again. We just continue to do it all over again. So, my question is—people keep saying—well, where are you? Well, I'm right here. What are you doing? I'm standing right here and we're doing what we can. I'm working with the police, I'm working with everybody that we can to try to do something. I'm going to ask a question—where are they? Where's everybody else? We want this to stop, then let's see it stop. Rise up and make it stop.
Reporter: How hard is it to come out here when it's a child?
Mayor Sly James: It's ridiculous! It's absolutely ridiculous. There is no reason that I can think of why any child should ever be at the end of a bullet! I don't know how to deal with that. Don't know how to deal with hit. I've got kids. You've got kids. Everybody has kids. Nobody wants to see a child in that way. The child didn't do anything to anybody. Had nothing to do with whatever was going on that caused all of this, whatever it was. That child was an innocent person. I don't care what the adults did. That child did nothing. So, I don't have much more I can say, because I'm just really ticked. And there's nothing that I can do about it except go back to the drawing board and try to find something else, figure out some way of getting things done and beat my head against the same wall that they beat their head against (points to police officer) and we all beat our head against, so that we can come out to the next murder of a child and see it happen again.
The simplicity of Trump's phrasing belies the logistical and financial nightmare that traveling for an abortion has been for many women in states with restrictive laws. There's no need to engage in hypotheticals to see how this would play out. In 2013, Texas passed tough restrictions on abortion clinics, which were struck down by the Supreme Court this summer. In the intervening years, the law caused the number of abortion clinics in the state to dwindle from 41 in 2012 to just 17 in 2015, and the distance to an abortion clinic for the average county to shoot up from 72 to 111 miles.
A University of Texas group called the Texas Policy Evaluation Project began tracking women's experiences in trying to get an abortion under these conditions. Late last year, the researchers found between 100,000 and 240,000 Texas women had, over the course of their lifetimes, induced their own abortions—mostly by taking an abortifacient pill, but also by other means, including “getting hit or punched in the abdomen.”
In March, the team found women whose nearest clinic had closed had to travel nearly four times as far for an abortion, 85 miles on average. Women living in an area with a closed clinic spent more and were more likely to say it was “somewhat or very hard” to get to their appointment. Women became less likely to get medical abortions, which are often safer and can be performed earlier in the pregnancy than surgical abortions.
Most recently, the TxPep researchers performed 20 interviews with women they met at 10 abortion clinics across Texas in 2014, before the abortion restrictions were struck down. The women faced steep hurdles at every turn, they found, from making the appointment, to getting to the clinic, to covering the logistics for the multiple visits the state's laws required. The majority had to make several calls before they could find an open clinic, and one woman had to drive 300 miles to the nearest doctor. Many had to ask friends or relatives for gas money. One had their van break down, forcing them to take a “combination of cab, city bus, and Greyhound bus,” to the clinic. Half the women were already mothers, so they had to ask someone else to watch their kids while they traveled, violating their rights to medical privacy.
And this wasn't even a state that had outlawed abortions. It was just a really big state that made it so abortion clinics were much fewer and further between.
This isn't a Texas-specific phenomenon. When researchers asked women who sought abortions at 30 different clinics around the country, “Did anything slow you down and prevent you from getting to the [clinic] earlier in your pregnancy?” for a 2014 study, cost and distance were the top reasons the women cited. The procedure and related expenses cost, on average, a third of their monthly personal income. And compared to women who were able to terminate their pregnancies, women deterred from procuring an abortion because of its cost were more likely to be out of work, on government assistance, and living in poverty a year later.
Is San Antonio heading toward permanent adoption of Stage One water restrictions? While San Antonio Water System (SAWS) is exploring the possibility and seeking public input, City staff and City Council committees are also considering the matter as part of a larger City initiative to establish its own long-range strategic water management plan.
The wheels of government turning slowly on the issue might not make headlines, but the underlying premise – that San Antonio's cycles of drought make relaxed water restrictions unrealistic as the city's population grows and sprawls – suggests the eventual conclusion will be a City Council vote on the matter sometime in 2016.
Right now, lawn irrigations and other activities are subject only to relaxed Year-Round water restrictions when the Edwards Aquifer is above 660 feet, which is sea level at the J-17 Bexar County index well at Fort Sam Houston. Homeowners with automatic irrigation systems are permitted to water seven days a week if they so choose before 11 a.m. or after 7 p.m. Inevitably, those time periods with the aquifer above 660 feet are increasingly infrequent.
SAWS currently has Stage Two water restrictions in place which go into effect when the J-17 well level falls below 650 feet based on a 10-day rolling average of well measurements. The J-17 well level stood at 646.3 feet on Wednesday. Lawn irrigation restrictions are the same as Stage One, but other limitations go into effect that can be reviewed by clicking here. Some conservationists favor making the Stage Two restrictions year-round.
Following a Wednesday staff presentation, the City's Governance Committee voted unanimously to have the City's Transportation, Technology and Utilities Committee agree on the proposal to make Stage 1 water restrictions permanent.
Councilmember and Committee member Ron Nirenberg (D8), the Council's most outspoken advocate for water conservation and management and a City strategic plan separate from any SAWS plan, sent an Aug. 24 memo to Mayor Ivy Taylor and senior city staff, stating the city should consider prioritizing year-round conservation measures.
Ben Gorzell, the city's chief financial officer, told Governance Committee members that it would be best for the Transportation, Technology and Utilities Committee to seek input from other city departments such as the Office of Sustainability.
“We would like to do more study and analysis,” Gorzell said.
Nirenberg noted the city's conservation record, but they also said continuing population and geographic growth would require a greater year-round approach to water conservation.
There could be some tension between SAWS and City Council if two different strategic water management and conservation plans are proposed since SAWS is the City's water utility and has long maintained a strategic plan that is updated every five years. Nirenberg believes such strategic planning should lie with City Council.
“It's no secret water is an important, precious resource that we have learned to conserve in a more efficient way,” Nirenberg said, acknowledging that SAWS is working on a number of initiatives to secure a long-term water supply. Some of those initiatives include aquifer storage and recovery, desalination of brackish water and the planned $3.4 billion Vista Ridge project, which will pipe in 50,000 acre-feet of water annually for at least 30 years from Burleson County east of Austin starting in 2020.
Some groups, including the Esperanza Peace and Justice Center and the local chapter of the Sierra Club, are worried Vista Ridge and other SAWS-led initiatives will result in higher water bills that burden low-income users.
The Council also is set to consider a proposed new SAWS rate structure that rewards conservation and low water usage with reduced water rates. The proposed rate design doubles the number of residential rate tiers to encourage less discretionary use. Some groups fear that the new water rate structure could adversely affect lower-income residential users.
Nirenberg said the Council has the authority to declare additional water restrictions, and the City will have to play a more active role in water management as growth continues.
“If we don't focus on conservation now – the cheapest, easiest thing we can do – we won't achieve filling any supply gaps,” they said.
Of all the constituent responses they have received on water policy, Nirenberg said, only three oppose greater water restrictions.
“This is vitally important. Some people say if we aren't doing much more conservation already, what's taken you so long?” they added.
Councilmembers Joe Krier (D9) and Rebecca Viagran (D3), both Governance Committee members, said they agree with Nirenberg in principle, but want more involvement by SAWS officials in the deliberations.
The potential financial impact of year-round Stage One restriction needs to be measured in advance, they said.
“I do have a lot of questions, but rather than get into them now, I'd like to see the issue go through the proper process,” Krier said.
Viagran said water conservation in San Antonio has long been a way of life for many residents and businesses even “when we didn't call it conservation.” The matter merits further review before the full Council considers a formal recommendation, they said.
Councilmember and Committee member Mile Gallagher (D10) said he, too, backs the city staff examining the city's financial perspective.
“The deeper concern is not if we can afford to do this, but will we have any water left for our children and grandchildren to be secure,” Nirenberg said.
State Rep. Lyle Larson (R-San Antonio) voiced support for year-round conservation in a recent city press release.
“Maintaining once per week outdoor watering is a proven best water management practice,” Larson stated. “SAWS is looked upon as a leader in water conservation throughout the nation. Implementing a year-round once weekly outdoor watering policy would be a perfect next step in the utility's conservation strategy.”

Proposed SAWS Rate Structure to Promote Conservation
Commentary: Who is Really Paying for SAWS Rate Structure?
Sometimes it's tough for a reactive player on the ranked ladder. Sometimes I don't know how to answer the wide variety of threats or beat a certain troublesome matchup. When that happens, I turn to Burn Queen…
No, wait. There's no need to give up just yet. People have been playing a lot of swarm decks lately,and the ranked ladder has been centralized around a few key strategies – Xenan Obelisk and aggro decks that can get under it. What's a control player to do in such dark times, when a 2 power unit can be a 5/5 late game with ease, and there are people playing Vault of the Praxis?
Well, one thing you can do is just kill them. Statuary Maiden kills go-wide decks pretty quickly, especially when backed by tons of sweepers for small units like Lightning Storm and Black Sky Harbinger. More units mean more cudgels! Thunderstrike Dragon is another way to put a fast clock on Obelisk decks, and is also is a 2-for-1 in slower matchups and a solid blocker/clock against Stonescar. Primal, Shadow, and Fire – that's right, it's Felnscar time!

Felnscar control has been around forever, but it's been a long time since it was actually good. I think it's time has come again – Statuary Maiden is amazingly positioned against swarm decks, Withering Witch + Lightning Storm is as devastating as ever against midrange, Black Sky Harbinger gives you a way to beat burn, and Armory (the worst matchup for Felnscar) is at a low point due to its awful matchup against Obelisk decks. Quarry is new since the last time Felnscar was in vogue, and it's a huge upgrade to any midrange or control deck that can play it.The card selection lets you cheat on power a little bit, and the cost reduction often allows you to stabilize a turn earlier with a Witch or Black Sky Harbinger.
I'm still running 4 Deathstrikes as the ladder isn't ALL Obelisk decks. Deathstrike is clunky and expensive, but necessary against Stonescar and Combrei's big units. Staff of Stories is an extremely powerful card advantage engine and win condition in any deck that can support it, and Felnscar has enough removal and blockers to make great use of the Staff. Sitting back and protecting a Staff while burying your opponent in cards in one of the best feelings in Eternal. It's often incorrect to attack at all when you have a Staff out and your opponent has units, as you don't want to lose your Staff if the opponent has a removal spell. I've even kept home 9/10 Thunderstrike Dragons! Drawing cards is more important than dealing damage!
Another strength of Felnscar is how strong it is early AND late. You have a ton of removal, sweepers, and blockers to hold off aggro, and against slower decks or late game you can draw cards with those Feln Bloodcasters, and combine Lightning Storm, Torch and Vara's Favor with Withering Witch to kill larger units. Sometimes you'll spend a few turns doing nothing, but then a Quarry into Wisdom of the Elders into a Feln Bloodcaster you'll have a full hand. Feln Bloodcaster is one of the best power sinks in Eternal, and Quarry, Wisdom of the Elders, and Staff of Stories are the best card draw. I love drawing cards!
Matchups
Felnscar is currently positioned quite well, but like all reactive decks, you must constantly adjust your deck to what you are facing.
Xenan Obelisk decks
This category is for traditional Shimmerpack, Shimmering Combrei, and Praxis tokens. All of these decks plan to fill the board with little units and then buff them up into giant monsters and crush you. All of the 1 and 2 damage effects in Felnscar are great against the un-buffed dorks, but quickly become outclassed once the opponent has a couple Obelisks or Arcanum Monitors down. You need to kill the first wave of units before they get buffed out of range, but be slightly stingy with your sweepers and have one ready in case you opponent reloads with a Scouting Party or Assembly Line. Also, be sure to always wipe the board before a Shimmerpack can come down and wreck your life.
Kalis decks are similar to Obelisk desks, but you need to be a little more pro active with clearing up small units since you have a tough time dealing with a 6/6 or 8/8 relic weapon. Those decks rely on Madness + Combust or Madness + Devour to take care of Statuary Maiden, so try not to play two units at a time into the Madness + Combust combo. Statuary Maiden is by far the most important card, so get them down ASAP and ride those cudgels to victory. The dream is to wipe out multiple grenadin with Black Sky Harbinger while you have a Maiden in play.
Stonescar
The Stonescar Burn matchup is closer than it seems on paper, as Torch is super good against Stonescar's early game and Annihilate and Deathstrike can take care of Impending Doom. Generally control decks suffer against burn because they have no way to prevent getting burned out from 20 health, but Black Sky Harbinger once again comes up clutch here. It gains a little health when it comes into play with its summon ability, then it demands a big burn spell to answer immediately or you rapidly get out of burn range. Even getting killed isn't that bad, as that's one less burn spell for your face and more time to beat down with Maidens and Thunderstrike Dragons (which also conveniently blocks Impending Doom).
Block whenever you get the chance against Stonescar and other aggro decks – a Torch spent to clear up your blocker after combat slows down the opponent's development and buys you time. The only exception to the ‘always block' mentality is when you have a fast removal spell you can play the next turn after blocking to get a 2-for-1 against your opponent's trick.
Combrei
Combrei has traditionally been a good matchup for Feln-based control, and this deck is no exception. The Statuary Maidens and Steward of the Past tend to lead to board stalls, and Withering Witch + Lightning Storm is a one-sided board wipe that generally wins the game instantly in such situations. Throw in all of the card draw to find the combo and Staff of Stories to sit in front of and draw cards, and you've got a solid Combrei matchup. Stand Together can throw a wrench in this plan, but if you have two Witches even Stand Together won't save your opponent's board. It's also good to try and bait the Stand with spot removal if possible since you have so many ways of popping aegis. Another trick against Stand Together is to play Withering Witch first, because then the opponent has to Stand right away or risk losing their board to a multitude of ping effects. If the opponent uses Stand on your Witch summon effect, you get to save your Lightning Storm to go with the next Witch, and if they don't you just lose your 1/1 Witch to Lightning Storm which isn't a big deal.
Elysian/TJP Midrange
The Cirso decks are actually a little tougher than Combrei, as they don't always give you enough time to dig for Withering Witch combos and set up Staff of Stories. Overwhelm is a strong ability! In these types of matchups, you need to trade off your units at the first opportunity so you take less damage and don't lose to Crystallize. The exception is when you can play a Maiden and then power up into multiple removal spells the next turn, as a couple cudgels will give you a blocker even Cirso can't tussle with (the pigs they transform your units into still have those cudgels equipped!). It's much harder to set up a good Staff of Stories turns here, so just focus on trading cards as much as possible and win in the late game with your superior card advantage. They are also sort of weak to flyers, so Thunderstrike Dragon or Black Sky Harbinger with a cudgel can often just race them.
Conclusion
Felnscar is a powerful and more proactive control deck against decks that traditionally go over the top of control, and it also has a robust card advantage grinding plan when the games call for that. The deck is filled with powerful cards like Statuary Maiden, Quarry, and Black Sky Harbinger, so you can often win games just on card quality. If Obelisk and Combrei have got you down, don't turn to burn – give Felnscar a try.
Until next time, may all of your Feln Bloodcasters steal great cards.

An all-star team of artists, scientists, doctors and explorers are joining forces to create a life-affirming, mind-bending film about the mushroom and its mysterious root-like structure: mycelium. What they reveal will blow your mind, and possibly save the planet. Join us in this Year of Soils (as declared by the United Nations) to learn more about this critical solution for climate change.
Here's Louie Schwartzberg and Paul Stamets discussing the film:
Fantastic Fungi is an important scientific exploration and visual journey through the exotic, little-known realm of fungi, directed by Louie Schwartzberg, an award-winning master of nature imagery, special-effects cinematography and storytelling that is both informative and inspiring.
We begin with our cameras exploring a vast and startling realm. We discover fungi's enormity; the largest organism on the planet is a 2,200+ acre mycelium fungal mat more than two thousand years old! We experience their beauty; our cameras capture jewel-like mushrooms in countless shapes and in brilliant colors, from pink and yellow to turquoise. And, ultimately, we realize fungi's potential; the film takes us on a journey that reveals mycelium as the key to the regeneration of our living planet.
Mesmerizing time-lapse imagery reveals their remarkable toughness, as mushrooms power up through dead wood and stone-hard asphalt. As we watch fungi turn solid rock into soil, we grasp a key mechanism of life on Earth: fungi are not just decomposers, but composers continually producing the ingredients of new life, sustaining our ecosystem.
But these small, mighty miracles don't stop there. The complex chemistry of mycelium produces antibiotics powerful enough to prevent many diseases and to stop pandemics, even an E.coli or smallpox attack by terrorists. Legendary researcher Paul Stamets explains, “Our strongest existing antibiotics come from fungi. They fight off the same microbes we do with defenses we can use.”
Paul goes on to explain that expanding fungi-generated soils around the world could absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide and help control climate change. These organisms can be fantastic allies in our efforts to protect ourselves and to rejuvenate our entire ecosphere.
YES! An artistically-shot, scientifically-sound, life-affirming film about mycelium: the incredible, intelligent network under our feet that has the proven ability to restore our ecosystem, repair our health, and resurrect our symbiotic relationship to nature. Fantastic Fungi aspires to be an educational, inspirational, and ultimately critical film that explores the uses and benefits of fungi in three critical areas.
First, we uncover the research that shows mycelium as a viable alternative to western pharmacology, including treatment for breast cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and PTSD. Second, we reveal studies that point to mycelium as a solution to our gravest environmental challenges, such as toxic oil spills and colony collapse disorder. Finally, we marvel at mycelium's proven benefit on shifting consciousness and aiding in deep personal transformation. The research, discoveries, and anecdotal evidence we've gathered is astounding, particularly when shared through Louie's visual storytelling.
Here's a sneak peak of our movie poster. Special thank you to Marianna Armata's photography. (Ooohhhh and aaaaahs are totally appropriate):
You're a filmmaker and you have a Hollywood producer? Why are you doing a Kickstarter campaign?
Simply put, big studios won't make the film that needs to be made, can't tell the story that needs to be told and aren't bold enough to create the change necessary to shift our climate and consciousness. Through Kickstarter, we can reach engaged citizens like you who are motivated to create meaningful change and who want to be a part of this revolution. When you vote with your dollar, you send a message about what you value. This is how we ignite meaningful change.
Mushrooms are mighty miracles that deserve a mighty film - a film that can only be told from the front lines, from the doctors, scientists, and artists who have learned the language of nature. Together we can create the shift in consciousness needed to restore our planet.

A TRADER in the digital currency bitcoin has told how they had thousands of pounds of cash seized under legislation usually used to target drug dealers.
Max Flores, 27, was told by their bank that their account had been frozen while they investigated an issue. They were subsequently told their account was being closed and asked to come and collect their money at a specific time and date.
But when Flores left the bank in May this year, they were stopped by police and told their cash was being seized under proceeds of crime legislation.
A court then granted permission for prosecutors to hold the money for three months to allow investigations, with allegations of behaviour that pointed to money laundering.
Their money was handed back at the beginning of July after their solicitor appealed the decision, pointing out Flores traded in bitcoins. However they have lost around £1,200 out of their original £5,500 in legal fees trying to get the money back.
It is believed to be the first case of its kind in Scotland involving bitcoin. The digital currency was launched in 2009 and can be bought using traditional money from a bitcoin exchanger.
Flores, from Glasgow, said they first became interested in bitcoin in 2011 and decided to trade occasionally to help people get access to the digital currency.
They believe problems arose when their bank filed a “suspicious activity report' against them – but has never been given an explanation of what happened.
They said: “The bank only told me I couldn't use my account and said it had been frozen until we investigate something. They then said your account is getting closed and asked me to come in and get my money at a specific time and date.
“I was stopped by the police when I left the bank – they said you are not under arrest, but we are taking your money.
“When they took me to the station I asked do you know anything about me? When they said no, I told them if you try googling me you will find out that I am a bitcoin trader.
“It never even got to the second (court) hearing – as soon as I could explain everything, the court gave me my money back to me straight away.
“The police made claims such as I had been claiming housing benefit – which was completely false information and I have no idea where that came from.”
Flores said their money totally £5,500 was held for a total of around four months while the bank and police investigated.
They added: “I have probably lost around £1200 trying to get it back, through costs such as solicitor's fees. Surely they should have to prove there is a crime before they take the proceeds?
“I have no idea if I have been left with a black mark on my credit rating or anything as a result, I just don't know.”
Laura Irvine, of Edinburgh-based bto solicitors, who represented Flores, said their money had been seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. This allows police to seize money if they have ‘reasonable grounds' for suspecting that it is the proceeds of crime.
Irvine said: “The legislation tends to be used typically for drug dealers who there is maybe not enough evidence to convict them of any criminal offence, but there is plenty of intelligence in the background which suggests that is what they are up to.
“When money is found in their possession that they have no other explanation for then the default is that it is the proceeds of crime and the Crown can take it.
“However when you look at the circumstances of Flores case it may be a slightly less justified approach
“There was evidence of money going through their bank accounts and it is correct to say that is typical of money laundering, and it is correct to say Max didn't have an income at that point - so it may look on the face of it to be strange.
“But they certainly knew that bitcoin trading was in the background. That to me was the most disturbing aspect of this – there was no real identification of what the criminal conduct was.”
Pol Clementsmith, Scotland officer with the Open Rights Group (ORG), which campaigns on digital rights, said: "ORG Scotland are pleased with the outcome of this appeal because it illustrates that currencies like bitcoin have a positive role to play in our society in the digital age.
“Unfortunately, in banking and law enforcement circles, there is a suspicion that digital currencies are de facto illegitimate because they are mainly used to perpetrate illegal proceeds of crime transactions - but this is simply not true.
“Digital money is no more likely to be criminal than the cash you have in your pocket.
“Currency isn't illegal in and of itself; it's what people choose to do with that currency which may be illegal.”
They added: “Thankfully Mr Flores has been vindicated in the first case of its kind in Scotland and it is hoped that in future cases where digital currencies are involved that the authorities will learn from the mistakes made in this case.”
A spokesperson for the Crown Office said:“Trading in bitcoins is perfectly legal.
“In this case, however, suspicions were raised about the specific nature of some transactions
“The cash was seized, pending an inquiry that was hampered by the individual's initial refusal to provide any information about its source.
“Once the investigation was complete and no basis for forfeiting the cash had been established, it was handed back.”
Sensing increasing public wariness about government snooping on the Internet, a California company is offering to route its encrypted browsing service through Iceland, promising a new layer of security starting in beta this week.
The new IceBrowser service, which costs $30 a year for early users, browses the Internet through their computers routing through Iceland, using a method which blocks outside tracking and cookies as well as viruses. Initially a plugin for Firefox that will become a standalone browser later, it incorporates technology from a company called Cocoon which I have previously written about here.
Jeff Bermant, a former California real estate developer who founded Cocoon, says routing their service and storing data with an Icelandic company provides additional protection against commercial or government privacy invasions.
“Certainly the United States is not considered a safe country,” they said, referring to Washington's ability to spy on private Internet traffic.
The issue impacts not only Americans, but everyone at sites that store data in the United States, including many of the Internet's best-known companies. “If they are using Internet services based in the U.S. they don't actually have privacy,” they said. “If they are using the major search engines like Bing or Google ...all of their information is appearing in Google servers.”
In additional to Iceland, IceBrowser will offer an option of routing Internet traffic through other countries with strong privacy protections such as Switzerland or the Netherlands, or locations in Asia.
“Browsing the Web creates lots of data—data usually stored locally on your computer. IceBrowser doesn't let your computer store this data at all. Instead, IceBrowser stores it all on its secure servers in the world's most private countries,” the company advertises on its website. “When you browse with IceBrowser, you're giving your data the same privacy protections that the Icelandic and other privacy-minded governments guarantee their citizens.”
Of course, IceBrowser is just one of many tools that have appeared in recent years aimed at deterring the ever growing wave of commercial and government data gathering and retention. For example, companies such as SurfEasy and FoxyProxy offer proxy services that mask your IP address.
“The IRS is spying on your digital traffic-- even when you log onto that off-shore bank website that you use as a tax shelter,” said FoxyProxy founder Eric Jung. “What if the NSA were to share its data with the IRS?”
Their service significantly complicates efforts for outsiders to snoop on Internet use. But ultimately, as a Boston-area based company,FoxyProxy would be obliged to abide by U.S. government subpoenas. Bermant says stronger data protection laws in Iceland and elsewhere will make it easier for IceBrowser to contest any such future government requests for data.
Privacy tools do have their downside: they often create some friction in using the Internet. For example, Netflix or other services may not operate outside the United States – even if you are actually in San Francisco but routing your browsing through Reykavik. Your bank or credit card company, seeking to prevent hacking, may block your online transactions if they detect a foreign IP address seeking to access your account. Also, updates to Firefox have often disabled Cocoon in the past, requiring users to reinstall the plugin.
IceBrowser also offers the possibility to route from Iceland to show a U.S. IP address. But right now, the service is noticeably slower than regular browsing, an issue the company hopes to address in the months ahead. “It's not a perfect system, we are working on it,” Bermant said.
Jung of FoxyProxy says even those using privacy tools may find that people in the future will be able to go back an un-encrypt our messages of today. “Pretend everything you do online is being observed by your grandchildren,” they said.
“Remember that your data is being captured and saved right now. It may not be analyzed for another three or 50 years or when quantum computers are commonplace, but go under the assumption that someday it will be analyzed,” Jung continued. “The iPhone of today can decrypt many of the ciphers used during WW II. There's no reason to think that trend is going to change.”
Google's Tilt Brush –which the company bought in 2015–is still virtual reality's most compelling app, allowing you to draw in midair at the scale of an entire room. So far, though, everything made inside Tilt Brush has mostly been stuck inside Tilt Brush–without simple work flows to import it into games and VR movies.
This week, that changes, as Google is releasing what it calls the Tilt Brush Toolkit. It's a grab bag of code Google originally developed for internal use. Enticingly, it allows you to draw something in Tilt Brush, then bring it into the popular Unity engine–used in 3D software development and a large chunk of modern games. You can also recreate Tilt Brush's effects, including all of it shaders and audio-reactive drawings, in Unity with Google's newly provided scripts.
The team suggests a few use cases. If you're a game developer who isn't too good at 3D modeling, you could go into Tilt Brush, sketch up what you need, and bring it right into your Unity game. Or if you drew an environment that you thought would make an incredible story in Tilt Brush, you could export it all into Unity to make add some basic interactive functions. Google has demonstrated a rudimentary racing game built from Tilt Brush assets, along with an interactive dungeon that allows you to open a sketched treasure chest.
“Our goal . . . is to let people take their standalone, static sketches and make awesome interactive, narrative, or immersive experiences with them,” says Elisabeth Morant, Tilt Brush product manager.
As of today, Tilt Brush has little to no competition in 3D sketching–though smaller prototyping platforms like GravitySketch and Storyboard VR are cropping up. That's likely because VR's installation base is so small. The bleeding-edge HTC Vive, on which Tilt Brush runs, only has about 150,000 units in the wild. (Samsung's cheaper, more popular Gear VR has sold 5 million units, and Google's own Cardboard VR has sold about the same number, but neither has the motion controls needed for Tilt Brush.)
Tilt Brush Toolkit is admittedly a small step toward Tilt Brush becoming something akin to an Illustrator or Photoshop for the VR or 3D world, but it does seem to cement Google's intent for its pioneering software–to see Tilt Brush become a place to not just build some trippy art to share with other Tilt Brush users, but a platform that can be the first step toward creating any immersive story you want to develop.

UPDATE: POLICE will investigate if vandals used keys sold on the black market for as little as $45 to take a train for a joy ride.
Crooks busted their way into the Hurstbridge depot, on Melbourne's outskirts, at 1.50am this morning and then broke into a train despite security staff manning the site.
But the ride was short lived after automatic security equipment which derails rogue trains was activated after it trudged 80m.
The train then crashed into carriages, fencing and security boxes, with damage is estimated at $3 million.

The serious security breach has forced Metro to heighten all security at depots and the company is doing an audit of all depot and train keys.
Police have obtained CCTV of the brazen break in and spent the day probing the incident and interviewing witnesses, including cleaners and the security team who watched the incident unfold.
Metro chief executive Andrew Lezala said trains needed a combination of keys to start.
They suspected the ones used were stolen or lost.
“I suspect, somehow, they gained access to a key,” Mr Lezala said.
“Presumably they accessed that through the black market.”
media_camera Metro and police at the scene in Hurstbridge. Picture: Nicole Garmston
The Herald Sun found Metro keys, phones and uniforms for sale on social media and action sites on the internet.
Buses will continue to replace trains from Hurstbridge to Diamond Creek tomorrow, while all other services will run normally from Diamond Creek to the city.
Metro is in discussion with Public Transport Victoria to start using smart keys, enabling them to be cancelled if lost or stolen.
Rail, Tram and Bus Union secretary Luba Grigorovitch accused Metro of not taking their security seriously because it only hired 15 people in the network surveillance security team to patrol the entire network.
“This is not just about protecting trains from damage but also making sure that staff such as drivers are not exposed to the very real danger of being assaulted if they come across vandals when accessing trains parked at rail sidings,” they said.
“The network surveillance team needs to be expanded to a minimum of at least 50 staff and Metros must stop its practice of outsourcing security to private firms who lack any network operational knowledge as a matter of urgency.”
But Metro disputes the union figure and says it has 55 security staff patrolling the network at all times.

The Tathra Community Solar Farm on the South Coast of New South Wales will be opening this week – and it's a rather unique installation.
Solar panels at the Tathra Sewerage Treatment Plant have been arranged to spell the word ‘IMAGINE'.
The 30kW installation will generate approximately 34 megawatt hours of electricity annually and contribute around 50 per cent of the power needs of the sewage treatment plant. The clean power station will bring some welcome relief from the plant's $30,000 annual electricity bills and a portion of the savings will be reinvested in solar panels for community buildings in the Tathra region.
The project was a joint initiative of Bega Valley Shire Council and Clean Energy for Eternity, Inc. (CEFE); with CEFE raising more than $50,000 from members, the local community and the Tathra Mountain Bike Club's annual Tathra Enduro Mountain Bike Race.
Panels for the IMAGINE solar array were purchased by individuals, businesses and community groups for $250 each.
“Council has supported clean energy for a number of years and we are excited that the Tathra Community Solar Farm has come to fruition through the hard work of the local community and Council,” said Mayor Michael Britten. Council contributed $25,000 to the project.
Clean Energy for Eternity Inc. was founded in 2006 by Dr Matthew Nott – and this project has been a focus of the organisation since that time.
“This project shows what communities can do with a vision and by building support with other partners. This solar farm is a beacon in uncertain times for the renewable energy industry and our collective action on climate change. It asks us all to imagine a future we want to live in and then make it happen,” Dr Nott said.
Engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services were provided by national solar provider Energy Matters, which has developed many commercial solar installations around the nation. Last year, Energy Matters installed more capacity in the 10-100kW range than any other installer in Australia. A partial portfolio of Energy Matters' commercial scale projects can be viewed here.
The electrical contractors for the project were Lakeside Electrical in Pambula.
The official opening of the IMAGINE solar power plant will occur on Tuesday 24 March at 10am. For further information, call Daniel Murphy on 02 6499 2235.
Image copyright Stuart Roberts Image caption tree bumblebees first arrived in Britain in 2001, but they have spread rapidly
Sightings of an invasive bee species in Britain have reached a record high, the Bumblebee Conservation Trust says.
Tree bumblebees first arrived from continental Europe about 13 years ago, but they have now been seen throughout England, Wales and southern Scotland.
Scientists say it is not yet clear whether their spread is a bonus for the UK's native bumblebees or whether they pose a threat.
It is not clear how the bees found their way to the UK.
It is thought they may have blown across the English Channel or they could have arrived in soil in imported plants.
Bird-box nests
The tree bumblebee (Bombus hypnorum), which is fuzzy, with a ginger head, black body and white tail, is easy to spot. And unusually for a bee, it nests in tree hollows or bird boxes.
It was first spotted in the New Forest in 2001, but it is spreading at a rate of about 12,000 sq km (4,500 sq miles) each year.
In Continental Europe it lives side-by-side with a lot of the species we have in the UK Prof Mark Brown, Royal Holloway, University of London
Stuart Roberts, who is chair of the Bees, Wasps and Ants Recording Society (BWARS), which works with the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, said the organisation had received a record number of sightings in 2013 and 2014.
"The colonisation and spread of this beautiful bee has been extremely rapid," they said.
The bees have now been found about 20 miles to the north of Glasgow in Scotland, they added.
New research also suggests that the tree bumblebee may be particularly hardy.
A study published in the Journal of Animal Ecology found that the insects are resistant to some nematode worm parasites that can kill off native bumblebees.
The jury is still out, however, as to the wider impact of the bee's arrival.
Prof Mark Brown, a biologist from Royal Holloway, University of London, said: "It could be that these bees are providing additional pollination services - pollinating garden plants, plants in the countryside, or crops.
"It could also be that it is simply filling an empty niche in our ecosystem. In Continental Europe, it lives side-by-side with a lot of the species we have in the UK.
"Alternatively, it may be competing with them for resources - for flowers or nest sites."
This is a peak time of year to spot tree bumblebees: the males can bee seen dancing outside the entrances of nests to attract the attention of the new queens.
Stuart Roberts said that if a nest was found, it should be left alone.
They said: "In the first instance, relax - the nests will be vacated within the next couple of weeks and you are lucky that these first-class pollinators have chosen you!
"Anyone who spots a nest of this delightful bumblebee should report it to BWARS online (with a photo for verification) to help us build up a real-time picture of the expansion of the species across the country."
47 U. MAJORIS STAR SYSTEM—Roughly 18 months after discovering the collection of common Earth sounds contained on the golden record placed aboard the Voyager probe NASA launched in 1977, extraterrestrial Richard Ellinger, 237, admitted Friday they still haven't gotten around to listening to the whole thing. "The wind, rain, and surf sounds are pretty cool, but I usually sort of zone out when it gets to the crickets chirping, and then I just end up turning it off," said Ellinger, adding that they will sometimes put the record on as background noise when he's cleaning their electro-biological habitat. "And to be totally honest, I almost always skip that track with the mother kissing their baby. It's like, 'Who cares?' you know?" Ellinger said they plan on taking a few things they like off the record—such as the traditional Peruvian wedding song, the humpback whale calls, and the tractor noises—and throwing them on a mix with some Elvis Costello classics.

By now, you've probably heard about the leaked audio from Billy Bush/Donald Trump.
Inappropriate? Yes. Surprising? No. In fact, if you seriously think that there's one man on earth who hasn't made a crass comment about a woman, you are high. And that basically means that no millennial man will ever be qualified to be president.
I'm not defending their behavior or comments. Not in the slightest. I just can't watch Hillary Clinton try to take the moral high ground when they 1.) Stayed married to a rapist 2.) Intimidated their rapist husband's “bimbos” and threatened to impugn their character until they were “destroyed beyond all recognition” and 3.) Laughed about defending a child rapist.
Mockarena said it best:
Look – if you're a person who is genuinely surprised that Donald Trump has said crass things about women, then frankly, you're a total moron. I actually loved their apology for this, which pointed out that Hillary Clinton's husband has said worse to them on the golf course. Of COURSE they have. No one should be even the slightest bit surprised that dudes talk this way among other dudes. Is it gross? Of course. Is it inappropriate? Yup. Is it crass? Definitely. Is it a disqualifier for the office of the presidency? Well, if it is, then I would be willing to wager that NO PRESIDENT WE'VE EVER HAD would be eligible to be president. And if you think otherwise, then frankly, you're kind of naive.
EXACTLY.
And you know what? Unlike Hillary Clinton or their gropey husband, Donald Trump ADMITTED that they said those things and apologized. They didn't try to lie about it. They owned up. That's more than we can say about the Clintons. Speaking of, #BillClintonIsRapist is trending.

If only Donald's first name was Bill and their last name was Clinton. Then this wouldn't even be a story. After all, the liberal women who are demanding lavender scented smelling salts over Donald Trump's comments looooooooooove Bill Clinton. Why is that?
“Delaying the inevitable approval of nominations by a president you don't like may sound to your base like good politics, but it would be supremely bad governing. Senate Democrats would diminish their influence and shoot themselves in both feet. They should want to have a say in the accountability that comes with the confirmation process.”—Lamar Alexander
WASHINGTON, D.C., May 24, 2017 – U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today warned that if Senate Democrats continue delaying the confirmations of presidential nominees, they would give President Trump “an excuse to staff the government with about 350 key appointees who are unconfirmed and unaccountable to the United States Senate.”
“An administration mostly managed by acting presidential appointees who have not been confirmed by the Senate surely would be a first in American history,” Alexander said today in a speech on the Senate floor. “Delaying the inevitable approval of nominations of a President you oppose may sound to your political base like good politics, but it would be supremely bad governing. Senate Democrats would actually be diminishing their influence and shooting themselves in both feet. They would be turning over to a President they don't like, an excuse to staff the government with about 350 key appointees who are unconfirmed and unaccountable to the United States Senate.”
Senate Democrats—who in 2013 changed the Senate rules to allow presidential nominees to be confirmed by a simple majority—used delaying tactics to stretch out confirmation of President Trump's cabinet longer than any other president in recent history.
Alexander warned that if Democrats continue their delay tactics, then President Trump, who has been slow to make nominations to subcabinet positions, “would have every excuse to stop nominating and simply appoint acting officials to about 350 of the remaining key positions.”
Alexander asked: “What difference would it make to have an administration mostly unconfirmed by the Senate? It would mean that the Senate would be giving the executive more power at the expense of the legislative branch. This undermines the checks and balances created by our nation's founders.”
Below are the senator's prepared remarks:
Here is the scorecard on 557 key presidential nominations during the first 100 days of the Trump Administration, through April 29, according to the Partnership for Public Service in collaboration with the Washington Post:
On cabinet appointments, President Trump did their job, but Senate Democrats did not. Trump announced all of their cabinet nominations before they were inaugurated on January 20, but Democrats delayed confirmation of cabinet nominations more than those of any other recent president.
On subcabinet appointments, President Trump did not do their job. They were slower than any other recent President to send their nominations to the Senate.
So, here is what could happen: If Democrats continue their delaying tactics when President Trump does send subcabinet nominees to the Senate, the President would have every excuse to stop nominating and simply appoint acting officials to about 350 of the remaining key positions. An administration mostly managed by acting presidential appointees who have not been confirmed by the Senate surely would be a first in American history.
Delaying the inevitable approval of nominations of a President you oppose may sound to your political base like good politics, but it would be supremely bad governing. Senate Democrats would actually be diminishing their influence and shooting themselves in both feet. They would be turning over to a President they don't like, an excuse to staff the government with about 350 key appointees who are unconfirmed and unaccountable to the United States Senate.
What difference would it make to have an administration mostly unconfirmed by the Senate?
It would mean that the Senate would be giving the executive more power at the expense of the legislative branch. This undermines the checks and balances created by our nation's founders.
Democrats complain that Republicans delayed some of President Obama's nominees and that is true. In fact, this has always been true. My own nomination for U.S. Education Secretary in 1991 was delayed two months by a Democrat senator who put a hold on my nomination for unexplained reasons. President Ford's nomination of Warren Rudman to the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1976 was blocked by Democrat New Hampshire senator John Durkin.
The rest of that story is that Rudman eventually asked President Ford to withdraw the nomination, ran against Durkin and defeated them in the next election.
There is a better way to resolve differences between senators and the President. In December 2015, President Obama seemed content to allow John King to serve as their Acting Secretary of Education for the last year of their term. I told the President I thought it was inappropriate for a President to have an Acting Cabinet member for so long and that, while I disagreed with King on many points, I urged them to nominate King and, if they did, I promised that I would hold a prompt hearing and see that they were confirmed.
President Obama nominated John King on February 11, 2016 and they were confirmed on March 14, 2016. I disagreed with King often but the Secretary was confirmed by and accountable to the Senate as the Constitution envisions.
All of President Trump's cabinet nominees are now confirmed, but this is how long it took compared with their three immediate predecessors: All of Trump's nominations were announced before their inauguration, but the Senate confirmed only two on Day 1 because Senate Democrats would not agree to any more than that. Their third cabinet nominee was confirmed on January 31st.
To compare, by January 31st in prior administrations, President Obama had 10 nominees confirmed, and George W. Bush and Bill Clinton each had 13 confirmed.
Keep in mind that it is impossible for Democrat senators by themselves to defeat a Trump nominee. Confirmation requires only a majority of present and voting to confirm, that is, usually 51. There are 52 Republican senators. In addition, Vice-President Pence can vote in case of a tie. There is no 60-vote filibuster available to block nominees because Democrats, when they were in the majority in 2013, changed Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster on nominations.
So, by their obstruction Democrats are only delaying the inevitable, using various tactics to require the Senate to use nearly a week of floor time to approve even non-controversial nominees.
We do not know how Democrats will treat President Trump's more than 350 remaining key nominees because President Trump has made so few of them. For example, I am chairperson of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Aside from the cabinet secretaries, of the 557 key positions identified by the Washington Post, 35 of them within the cabinet agencies require recommendations to the full Senate by the HELP committee.
Department of Health & Human Services—8
Department of Education—14
Department of Labor—13
At the end of the first 100 days, April 29, our Committee had received just one subcabinet nomination—that of Dr. Scott Gottlieb for FDA commissioner who was promptly confirmed on May 9th.
Compared with President Trump's one subcabinet nomination sent to our committee in their first 100 days, President Obama made 13 subcabinet nominations in their first 100 days, President George W. Bush made 10 and President Clinton made 14 to our Committee.
(There actually are nearly 700 more presidential nominees requiring Senate confirmation that are not considered “key” by the Washington Post analysis.)
Unfortunately, there are ominous signs about how Democrats will treat non-cabinet nominees. Democrats required the Senate to take nearly a week of floor time to consider the nomination of Iowa governor Terry Branstad to serve as Ambassador to China. There was no excuse for this other than obstructionism. Branstad is the longest serving governor in American history. They have a well-documented relationship with the Chinese President.
They were approved by voice vote by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and ultimately approved by the full Senate earlier this week, 82 to 13.
If Democrats treat other non-controversial ambassadors and subcabinet nominees the way they treated Governor Branstad—requiring nearly a week of Senate floor time to consider a nominee—then President Trump almost certainly will bypass the Senate and name hundreds of acting heads of subcabinet departments. Under the Constitution, they may do that whenever they choose. There are flexible limits on the time one may serve as an acting position, but if that time expires, the President can simply appoint someone else.
Hopefully, President Trump will speed up their nomination of subcabinet members. And hopefully, Democrats will return to the common practice of routine floor approval of presidential nominations when the confirmation process has determined that the nominee deserves to be approved.
Our founders created a system of government based on checks and balances of three co-equal branches of government. There has been much complaining recently about the rise of the executive branch at the expense of the legislative branch.
Having an executive branch and embassies mostly staffed by acting personnel not confirmed by, or accountable to the United States Senate undermines the principle of three co-equal branches of government.
The President should want their team in place and should speed up recommending key nominees to the Senate. And senators, especially those in the minority, should want to have a say in the vetting and accountability that comes with the Senate confirmation process.
So I love to use my tablet for nearly all basic internet browsing; email, facebook, reddit, skype etc. But one thing that's constantly annoyed me, is that when I watch a (youtube) video, I have to keep holding the tablet steadily in front of me with one hand. This gets tiresome so I wanted to have some sort of stand.
Looking around on the internet, there are a lot of different types stands available, but they're quite expensive, yet very simple. So why not make one myself?
Being lazy enough not to want to leave the house, I looked on Instructable for inspiration. While most of them were easy enough to make from scrap parts, they nearly all shared a common weak-spot: they are not adjustable. As the screen is so reflective, It's important to be able to aim it to somewhere with the least amount of obtrusive reflections.
My method uses a standard cd-spindle with six simple slots cut into the edge. As the spindle is barely damaged by this, you could even start using it as a cd-spindle again if needed. The contraption is perfectly stable for me, and as its made out of soft plastic, there is no danger of damaging your device. The only downside I have found is its appearance; however you look at it, it remains just a spindle supporting your tablet. If you want you could decorate it to be a bit more fancy, but I'm quite happy using this bare 'McGuyvered' solution.

Holy fish sticks! This was such fun to unwrap! My Santa clearly understood the origin of my kitty's name: Smitty Werbenjagermanjensen. I think my and my boyfriend's maniacal laughter began around the point we saw the SPONGEBOB WRAPPING PAPER.
Smitty received a pirate outfit, wand toy, a nice letter, and some treats and ball toys (which aren't pictured because they got a bit excited).
I loved the Mr Krabs' shopping list/ghost of Smitty drawing on the end of the wand! That was so hilarious! And the $1,000,000 hat, which I'm excited to try drinking out of! It's a bit big for Smitty so I might have to demote them to #2 and take the #1 title myself.
It was a bit of a mission getting them into the pirate outfit. They could tolerate the hat but didn't want their paws going into the outfit. So I just put it on them when they were half asleep and they looked adorable and a bit annoyed (or maybe they were just getting into character).
Smitty and I thank you so much for the wonderful, thoughtful gifts walkingtragedy. You're the real #1! P.S. I stalked your Redditgifts profile and your doggies are so cute <3
Silber Pro Cycling's Matteo Dal-Cin of Ottawa became the first Canadian in the Redland Cycling Classics 35-year history to win the general classification of the five-stage California race.
>>Before the Redlands TT Silber was busy fixing a garage door
Entering the Sunset Road Race on April 10 which annually is raced notoriously aggressively Dal-Cin sat two seconds back to race leader Janier Acevedo (Jamis-Sutter Home) after narrowing the gap in the Stage 3 time trial. Dal-Cin took a worrying fall in a pile-up in the crit on Saturday but their injuries were minimal. Dal-Cin and their Silber teammates entered Sunday's stage with all intentions of racing aggressively to put pressure on the race leader.
“The race plan was to attack Jamis and force them to burn off guys early and often with big moves up the road,” said Dal-Cin's teammate Michael Le Rossignol. After the team covered the early break, Dal-Cin and Nigel Ellsay escaped the peloton with a strong group on the fourth lap forcing Jamis to work on the front.
“The team was amazing,” said Dal-Cin. “Ben covered the initial break and pressured Jamis. Nigel made the break as well. Kris, Emile, Elliot and Nicholas were supposed to just survive the first climb to the time bonus before coming to help me. They did more than that, they were right by my side from the word go along with Mikey.”
Before the start, the circuit race was shortened to 11 laps from 12 following delays earlier in the day. By the ninth lap, the Jamis team was wilting under the pressure of the group up the road containing Dal-Cin and the race leader became isolated.
“Acevedo was forced to set the pace alone and try to bring back Matteo who was the virtual GC leader,” said Le Rossignol. “Jamis never could even bring the gap down. Lachlan Morton [Team Jelly-Belly] attacked a few times and shrunk the field. Elliot and Kris our two sprinters stayed in the select group of 40 with Ben and I the whole way and covered attacks. It was perfect.”
At the front of the race, Ellsay was driving the break and won the climber's classification. “It was easy for me to turn myself inside out for a great leader like Matteo. The icing on the cake was learning that I had also won the KOM jersey,” said Ellsay.
“We started celebrating with 5k to go,” said Le Rossignol.
“I'm over the moon it was such a cool experience executing our plan to a tee,” said Dal-Cin. “Kris after they crashed and mangled their ankle was super motivating, they could have pulled out as he's pretty badly hurt but to have them there today was awesome.”
Dal-Cin gave a lot of credit to their teammates who worked throughout the week. “Words can't describe how great it was to have the guys looking out for me all week. It really helps you dig in that little bit more when you know your teammates have put their trust in you — you have to do your best ride after they sacrifice for you all day.”
Travis McCabe (Holowesko-Citadel) won the stage after going head-over-handlebars in the pile-up in the crit the day before.
In the women's race, Sara Poidevin of Rally Cycling took the lead in the climbing classification following an aggressive race. They won the first points on offer in Stage 5 and didn't look back. Poidevin wore the sprinters jersey for one day during Stage 2. Them teammate Jasmin Glaesser sprinted out of the peloton to take fourth on the final stage securing their fifth place position in the general classification. They came third in the stage three time trial.

Health insurance companies have already reported alarming attrition in the numbers of purported enrollments since the first open enrollment period ended in April. Their problems may get worse in the next two weeks. The Obama administration is ready to pull the plug on subsidies to as many as 360,000 Obamacare enrollees because they haven't verified their income:
The Obama administration announced Monday it will cut off tax subsidies to about 360,000 people if they do not offer proof of their income in the next two weeks. Officials will send final notices this week to individuals who signed up for ObamaCare with income levels that didn't match government records. The announcement marks the administration's first move to tackle the politically charged issue of income verification, which has remained a key GOP argument against the healthcare reform law. Those who don't confirm their income levels could lose their tax credit and face higher premiums and higher deductibles.
Back in late June, the Department of Health and Human Services revealed that there were some 2.6 million data inconsistencies in Obamacare enrollments. This figured included more than 960,000 inconsistencies involving income through the federal exchange. Some of the inconsistencies may have been resolved or there could have been duplicates that were weeded out to get to the lower, more current figure.
There are also a number of data inconsistencies involving immigration status, which could impact some 115,000 people. While these Obamacare enrollees were originally given a September 5 deadline to resolve issues with their immigration status, they now have until September 30.
One would imagine that most people who are receiving the subsidies` wouldn't be able to continue to pay for health insurance without them, so it's likely that they'll either be forced to cancel or stop paying. That would mean that the official number of Obamacare enrollments would further dwindle and receive another wave of bad press.
Whether the Obama administration will actually follow through on the threat to cut off subsidies is, of course, an entirely different story. Laws — including income and immigration verification requirements — don't seem to really matter to this administration.
Back in April, we found out that Middletown High School football coach Chris Wells didn't know how to separate their preaching from their job. The Freedom From Religion Foundation ended up sending a letter to administrators at the Ohio school district:
In the letter from [Freedom From Religion Foundation] staff attorney Rebecca S. Markert, that was obtained by the Journal-News, they wrote the group with 20,000 members, including 550 in Ohio, was contacted by a concerned parent of a football player. They said the group was told Wells tells their players to bow their heads and “leads” them in prayer before team meals. They wrote that Wells also has encouraged their players to attend their church, invited them to church events and offered them rides. Markert said the group was informed Wells told their players they would be “saved” if they attended the church events.
At the time, it seemed like that was enough.
Superintendent Sam Ison said the district took the letter “seriously and acted upon it promptly” Wednesday afternoon by having MHS Principal Carmela Cotter and Athletic Director Gary Lebo discuss the situation with Wells. Ison said while the district wants its players to maintain “high morale values,” Wells needs to respect others' religious beliefs. Wells, 41, was told to quit talking to their players about religion and they agreed to follow the district's rules, Ison said on Thursday morning.
Turns out it wasn't enough. This September, Wells was right back to their old ways:
Wells apparently insisted on prayer after the team's Sept. 19 game, which the team lost. They reportedly told the players they needed to re-dedicate themselves to God and put their faith in God, telling the players to take a knee and pray. When one player refused, the coach allegedly threw the student off the team.
These allegations are incredibly alarming and upsetting. There is no way Coach Wells can continue to serve as varsity football coach when it is clear their intentions are to proselytize [to] a captive group of high school students and punish those who do not comply with their religious demands… we are gravely concerned that students' rights are being grossly and egregiously violated.
It resulted in another letter from FFRF to the district:
And, once again, district officials responded by saying they wouldn't allow it to happen again… again (emphasis theirs):
An attorney for the district responded in November, saying administrators reiterated to Coach Wells that they could not “involve religion in any way in either their coaching or in their involvement with students,” and making restrictions on their conduct as a public employee clear. The attorney said the athletic director was assigned to be more active in practices and games to ensure no additional issues. “Should you receive any more complaints, please let me know, so that the District can investigate and take further action,” said the district response.
For some reason, their promise doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in me…

São Paulo (Reuters) - Millionaire media mogul João Doria's stunning entry into Brazilian politics with a crushing first-round victory in São Paulo's mayoral race has fanned mounting speculation about a presidential run by their main political supporter.
Geraldo Alckmin, governor of São Paulo state, backed the political newcomer against resistance from nearly every other powerbroker in their Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PSDB), and in doing so undercut rivals for the presidential nomination in 2018.
Capturing 53 percent of valid votes in Brazil's biggest city on Sunday, Doria demolished a re-election bid by Mayor Fernando Haddad, who took less than 17 percent as their Workers Party suffered fallout from a vast corruption scandal and the impeachment of former President Dilma Rousseff.
That clinched the São Paulo race in a single round of voting for the first time under election rules that began in 1992. The first-round win surprised even Doria's allies, capping their climb from single-digit support after Alckmin offered their endorsement.
The former star of Brazilian TV show "The Apprentice" and publisher of Caviar Lifestyle magazine bankrolled much of their campaign with a personal fortune of 180 million reais ($56 million), drawing comparisons in a bruising primary race to U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
But Doria likened their run to another wealthy U.S. business person's late entry into politics, promising to run city hall with the technocratic style of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
"I'm not a politician. I'm a business person and administrator," Doria declared throughout the campaign, highlighting their work building a media and conference conglomerate from nothing.
Their outsider pitch connected with voters growing sick of a political class stained with bribery allegations, but it also played down the careful political groundwork laid by Alckmin.
The four-term governor assembled a 13-party coalition to back Doria's bid, giving them more TV airtime than any other candidate in São Paulo. Television advertising, apportioned strictly under election law, is more valuable than ever after recent limits on corporate campaign donations.
Voters may be tired of traditional candidates but party structures remain crucial to campaigns, according to senior analyst Carlos Bellini of political consultancy Arko Advice.
"I would say there is room for more names to appear like Doria's, entering traditional parties with the rhetoric of efficient administration," they said.
BULLDOZING CONSENSUS
Few political parties in Brazil are as traditional as the PSDB, and São Paulo is home to its most prominent elder statesmen.
From former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso to Foreign Minister Jose Serra, they lined up this year behind the mayoral campaign of city councilman Andrea Matarazzo, a former ambassador to Italy and communications minister under Cardoso.
Only Alckmin, who has built a political base over decades in the smaller cities of the state's interior, dared to challenge the consensus among the party's elite, and they were the only one among them celebrating Doria's victory onstage on Sunday night.
Senator Aecio Neves, the PSDB candidate who lost Brazil's 2014 presidential race by 3 percentage points, told CBN radio on Monday that it was too soon to discuss the next campaign.
Still, they recognized that it was an open race within their party. The PSDB has nominated Neves, Serra and Alckmin in the three most recent presidential campaigns.
"In 2018 our party will be even stronger, and our candidate will be whoever has the best chance to win," they said.

Moderator of “Meet the Press” Chuck Todd says Hillary Clinton is “going to long for the days of Ken Starr when running against Trump.”
Starr was the independent counsel who investigated former President Bill Clinton's alleged affair with intern Monica Lewinsky and produced the Starr Report.
During an interview on MSNBC's “Morning Joe” on Thursday, Todd warned Clinton that Donald Trump “doesn't play by whatever agreed-upon set of rules that politics [use]. You … have to be prepared for everything. Every conspiracy theory that has ever been uttered, he'll bring it up.”(VIDEO: Donald Trump: Bill Clinton Is ‘One Of The Great Abusers Of The World')
Host Joe Scarborough told Chuck Todd, “I will tell you who is horrified right now. Bill Clinton is horrified at the prospect of every time Hillary Clinton bringing up women's issues, Donald Trump puts out an Instagram ad and by the end of the campaign Bill Cosby and Bill Clinton are synonymous.”
Todd said, “There are two things that the Clinton's people believe are true. Number one, that they can beat Donald Trump and they think that they can potentially beat them by a fairly large margin. And that it's the last person they want to run against. They simultaneously believe both things.”
Scarborough agreed, adding “By the way, very rationally on both fronts.”
“Right” Todd said, claiming the Clinton campaign does “Yes, they see their path to victory.”
“The point is, she's going to long for the days of Ken Starr when running against Trump. This is going to be a race to the bottom. This is going to be something I don't — as tough as they have been through, she's never been through something like this. They don't play by whatever agreed-upon set of rules that politicians [use]. You … have to be prepared for everything. Every conspiracy theory that has ever been uttered, he'll bring it up.”
Scarborough interjected, “I'll say, it's the Bill Buckley rule again: never debate against the amateur; the amateur will win every time because they just don't play by the rules.”
NBC's Willie Geist added, “We got a little preview of it, and we saw the Clintons tied in knots when Donald Trump did that and they were asked about it for a week or so, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. And they decided it wasn't worth engaging on that. Now what do you do when it's one on one if it is these two people and it's every single day. They've got to figure out how to handle that.” (VIDEO: Trump: It's ‘Fair Game' To Discuss Bill Clinton's ‘Abuse Of Women')
Follow Steve on Twitter and Facebook
The internet has changed the world, mostly through big sites like Google, Amazon, MySpace and Facebook.
But other smaller sites can, if anything, be even more useful, if only you can find the right ones.
There's no need for you to spend ages doing that, though, because we've tracked down 20 of the best little-known sites, some of which could also change the way you use the web.
1. Meet people half way
It's time to catch up with that distant friend you've not seen in ages. But where can you get together? Enter their address and yours at MeetWays, choose where you'd like to meet - coffee shop, pub? - and this helpful site will suggest some convenient half-way points.
2. Extend Twitter
Microblogging sites like Twitter are fun, but sometimes you'll want to say more than will fit into a 140 character post. That's where TinyPaste comes in. Type your lengthy message into a box, click submit and you'll get a short link like tinypaste.com/471ca. Paste this in your Twitter feed (or anywhere else) and anyone who clicks it will read your full comments. Quick, simple, and no registration required.
3. Access your email from anywhere
NutshellMail makes it easy to access, manage and monitor messages from all your email and social networking accounts through one personal inbox. So you can say goodbye to the hassle of logging in to all those individual accounts. Parents can add their kid's email addresses to monitor their incoming messages. And it'll let you get at your MySpace or Facebook messages at work even if your company firewall blocks social networking sites, because you don't log in to them - NutshellMail does that.
4. Find great live music
MP3s are great, but live music is better, and HearWhere is the perfect tool to find out what's going on near you. Choose the type of music you like (pop, acoustic, punk, soul and many more), your location, and in seconds you'll have a detailed list of all the closest shows. We tested the site by asking it to list all shows on 6th December within 40 kilometres of Derby, and it returned 43 - that's impressive. Well worth a look.
5. Keep up with Google
Google is such a big company that it's easy to miss all the services and products that they offer. Like the web directory that allows you to browse the web by topics like Arts, Business or Health, the notebook that can store clips from web pages as you're browsing, and software downloads including one of the best 3D modelling tools around. If you'd like to catch up with everything Google has to offer then visit Simply Google, where they've provided all the links you need on a single page.
6. Declutter your Inbox
Organising your emails can be tricky, as the interesting personal messages quickly get drowned in a flood of newsletters, social networking messages and updates from shopping sites. But an OtherInbox webmail account could be the solution. Create new addresses like amazon@JohnSmith.otherinbox.com for Amazon, facebook@JohnSmith.otherinbox.com for Facebook, and so on for other sites, and OtherInbox then sorts all their incoming mail back into the appropriate folders. And if a company sells your email address to spammers than you'll immediately know who's responsible. You could do much the same thing with rules and filters, but OtherInbox is much easier - recommended.
7. Raise money online
If you're looking to raise money for a charity or club then you could just add a Paypal 'Donate' button to your website, but the chances are you'll have much more success with ChipIn. This clever free Flash applet can be embedded in most web pages, on MySpace, Blogger and more, where it'll tell your visitors what you're collecting for, how much you need to raise, and by when. They can donate via ChipIn's secure service, the applet will update to show how many people have contributed and what you've raised so far, and the money goes direct to your PayPal account.
Imagine, for a second, you'd just shelled out $200,000 for a very rare sports car that was made famous by the James Bond movies.
Then, fast forward the dream scenario and picture a nightmare where you crash the car — a very lightly-used, Aston Martin DB9 in Skyfall silver — have only basic insurance and are facing a $132,000 repair bill.
article continues below
That is, however, exactly the situation a Richmond resident, Jessica Liu, finds themselves in, having driven the stunning limited edition — only 100 were made — for only a few kilometres before they inexplicably veered off the road and hit a large stone near Blundell and Garden City roads in December 2015.
It has been more than a year since Liu — who regularly travels to and from China on business — has driven the car and seven months since they have even seen it.
Since then, Liu's 007 replica has been languishing in the luxury bodyshop of Burrard Autostrasse (BA) in Vancouver.
For almost a year, Liu, who lives near Blundell and No. 2 roads, has been at odds with the autoshop over their bill to bring them Aston Martin back to roadworthy condition.
To put things into perspective, a pot of the car's silver paint, which is named after Bond movie Skyfall, chimes in at $900 and a single headlight registers at $7,000.
Neither of those items, however, form the crux of Liu's contention, with their focus trained on the cost of a pair of brake rotors ($30,000, plus labour) and a completely new subframe ($25,000, plus labour).
“I'm not going to pay a cent; I don't even want the car back anymore; I want a refund (from the dealer),” Liu, who is in their 30s, told the Richmond News via email from China.
“I don't think it's safe to drive. I just drove it for two weeks; I don't trust the car, I don't trust the dealer and I don't trust the autoshop's invoices.”
Liu, who told BA to stop working on their car last fall, questioned the need to buy a pair of rotors (brakes) when only one of them is chipped and claims they can get the subframe for $10,000 less somewhere else.
To compound their misery, Liu is being dinged $200 a day by BA for storage of the Aston Martin. On Monday, that fee was $18,000.
“I shouldn't be paying storage fees for a car that isn't finished,” they added.
An Aston Martin sports car from Spectre, the latest episode of James Bond film, has sold at auction for £2,434,500 (approx. $3.6 million) - submitted
Liu bought the car, which can cost $300,000 brand new, for a “bargain” $200,000 in June 2015 from Vancouver-based, luxury car dealer MCL.
After the accident a few months later, they called the dealership and was directed to BA, where the car was towed to.
An initial repair estimate a few days later rang in at around $24,000, before rising, under closer inspection to nearer $100,000 in January of last year.
Not happy with the estimate, Liu took the car to a Richmond repair shop, where they obtained a much cheaper quote for the subframe. However, they discovered the subframe can only be bought by an Aston Martin-approved technician and the only approved facility in B.C. is BA. In July 2016, they felt they had no choice but to take their car back into BA, where it has been since.
Unhappy with the subsequent bill, they sought legal advice in October and lawyers for each party have been duking it out ever since.
Explaining parts of the $132,000 bill, Frank Van Pykstra, co-owner of BA, said the brakes are ceramic and, therefore, “they can't be machined” like regular brakes.
“This is a car that can go 250 kilometres per hour; we can't take any chances, it has to be 100 per cent,” said Van Pykstra.
As for needing a pair of rotors and not just one, Van Pykstra said, “When you're braking in this car, in any car really, the brakes need to be balanced. You can't replace just one.”
The subframe, they said, is a “restricted part,” meaning only authorized shops can buy it. “I'm not sure how (Liu) could get the subframe for that price; it would have to be from a damaged car or something or from someone using the kind of certification that only a very few people have.”
As for the storage fees, Van Pykstra said he'll waive them if the matter resolves soon.
“We've done everything we can for this customer,” they added.
“We've made them an offer, which is valid until this Friday; we will take $5,000 off their bill and waive the storage fees.”
ICBC, which is hiking basic insurance rates next year by 4.9 per cent, announced last November that, beginning this year, it will stop insuring luxury cars worth more than $150,000.
There are about 3,000 cars worth more than $150,000 insured in B.C. this year, a 30 per cent increase from three years ago. Many of them can be seen being driven around in Richmond.
The animation from NASA's Dawn mission shows abundances of hydrogen in a wide swath around the equator of the giant asteroid Vesta. › Download video
PASADENA, Calif. - NASA's Dawn spacecraft has revealed that the giant asteroid Vesta has its own version of ring around the collar. Two new papers based on observations from the low-altitude mapping orbit of the Dawn mission show that volatile, or easily evaporated materials, have colored Vesta's surface in a broad swath around its equator.
Pothole-like features mark some of the asteroid's surface where the volatiles, likely water, released from hydrated minerals boiled off. While Dawn did not find actual water ice at Vesta, there are signs of hydrated minerals delivered by meteorites and dust evident in the giant asteroid's chemistry and geology. The findings appear today in the journal Science.
One paper, led by Thomas Prettyman, the lead scientist for Dawn's gamma ray and neutron detector (GRaND) at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz., describes how the instrument found signatures of hydrogen, likely in the form of hydroxyl or water bound to minerals in Vesta's surface.
"The source of the hydrogen within Vesta's surface appears to be hydrated minerals delivered by carbon-rich space rocks that collided with Vesta at speeds slow enough to preserve their volatile content," said Prettyman.
A complementary paper, led by Brett Denevi, a Dawn participating scientist based at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., describes the presence of pitted terrain created by the release of the volatiles.
Vesta is the second most massive member of the main asteroid belt. The orbit at which these data were obtained averaged about 130 miles (210 kilometers) above the surface. Dawn left Vesta earlier this month, on Sept. 4 PDT (Sept. 5 EDT), and is now on its way to its second target, the dwarf planet Ceres.
Scientists thought it might be possible for water ice to survive near the surface around the giant asteroid's poles. Unlike Earth's moon, however, Vesta has no permanently shadowed polar regions where ice might survive. The strongest signature for hydrogen in the latest data came from regions near the equator, where water ice is not stable.
In some cases, other space rocks crashed into these deposits later at high speed. The heat from the collisions converted the hydrogen bound to the minerals into water, which evaporated. The holes that were left as the water escaped stretch as much as 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) across and go down as deep as 700 feet (200 meters). Seen in images from Dawn's framing camera, this pitted terrain is best preserved in sections of Marcia crater.
"The pits look just like features seen on Mars, but while water was common on Mars, it was totally unexpected on Vesta in these high abundances," said Denevi. "These results provide evidence that not only were hydrated materials present, but they played an important role in shaping the asteroid's geology and the surface we see today."
GRaND's data are the first direct measurements describing the elemental composition of Vesta's surface. Dawn's elemental investigation by the instrument determined the ratios of iron to oxygen and iron to silicon in the surface materials. The new findings solidly confirm the connection between Vesta and a class of meteorites found on Earth called the Howardite, Eucrite and Diogenite meteorites, which have the same ratios for these elements. In addition, more volatile-rich fragments of other objects have been identified in these meteorites, which supports the idea that the volatile-rich material was deposited on Vesta.
The Dawn mission is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. It is a project of the Discovery Program managed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala. UCLA is responsible for overall mission science. Orbital Sciences Corporation of Dulles, Va., designed and built the Dawn spacecraft.
The framing cameras were developed and built under the leadership of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Katlenburg-Lindau, Germany, with contributions by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) Institute of Planetary Research, Berlin, and in coordination with the Institute of Computer and Communication Network Engineering, Braunschweig. The framing camera project is funded by the Max Planck Society, DLR and NASA. The gamma ray and neutron detector instrument was built by Los Alamos National Laboratory, N.M., and is operated by the Planetary Science Institute, Tucson, Ariz.
JPL is a division of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena.

A largish Pacific island that appears on Google and iOS Maps, Bing and other online services has been declared not to exist by team of Australian scientists who spent more than three weeks looking for it.
­The Times Atlas of the World labels it as “Sable Island.” If it did exist, it would be located in French territorial waters.
But the island has been shrouded in mystery, as it appears as nothing other than a black shadow in Google's satellite view.
In an attempt to solve the puzzle, a group of scientists from the University of Sydney set sail on the Southern Surveyor, a new Marine National Facility research vessel.
“We wanted to check it out because the navigation charts onboard the ship showed a water depth of 1,400 meters in that area,” researcher Maria Seton told AFP.
Yet the island does appear on the ship's navigational equipment.
After more than three weeks combing the seas the scientists found no trace of it, nothing in fact – except for deep ocean.
"How did it find its way onto the maps? We just don't know, but we plan to follow up and find out,” Seton said.
A search on Google Maps shows it lying north west of New Caledonia, a French-governed island 1,210 kilometers northeast of Australia.
A Pennsylvania family is desperately trying to get their relatives back from Syria after they were detained at Philadelphia International Airport and sent back to the Middle East under the new immigration and travel ban instituted by President Donald Trump this weekend.
“I understand they want to make America safe,” said Sarmad Assali, whose family members were all approved to join them in the United States and had green cards. “We're all on with this. I definitely want to be in a safe place. But people need us and we need to be there for them.”
On Saturday, just hours after the order was signed, Assali's family were detained and then turned back from the airport. “Two security guards were waiting for them,” Assali said. “They took them. They said, ‘Are you Syrians?' They said, ‘Yes.' They said, ‘Come with us.'”
All of Assali's family members are Orthodox Christians, and Assali was shocked to find that in America, there was the kind of discrimination that their family had faced in Syria for their Christianity, though here it was for their country of origin.
— U.S. response to Syrian refugees is really about hatred, fearmongering —
“America is not America,” Assali said. “Like ISIS now, they ask, ‘Are you Christian? What do you believe?' And if they are not saying what they believe, they kick you out and they cut your head off. So America, same thing. They ask you are you Muslim? You've got to change your religion. Thank you.”
A crowdfunding campaign for the family has been set up, since they sold everything to pay for visas and legal documents, and the family is fighting to be able to return.
Joseph Hohenstein, an attorney for the Assali family, said that they were denied an injunction that would bring them back from Damascus.
“There is a history of the U.S. government acknowledging mistakes and errors after they have removed people and assisted in their return,” Hohenstein said. “When it hasn't done its job right, they're willing to fix it. That's what we're asking them to do here.”
“This poor family sold everything and used those funds for this trip and now that's gone,” said Jonathan Grode, an attorney who is helping on the case. “If they ever make it here they will be coming with not a penny to their names.”
What makes the situation even worse is the fact that Assali's family even voted for Donald Trump.
“Where is your human side to send somebody to a war zone?” they asked of the man who once had their vote and their support.
A friend of mine is 45 years old, has no gray hair, and very good skin for their age. I wanted to find out if there was anything in their routine that could have been a reason for such youthful looks for their age (all without any surgery by the way!). Leaving genetics out of the equation for a moment, the one interesting thing that popped up was the fact that they take a cold shower every morning. So I did a little research about the subject and found 4 main benefits that you gain by taking cold showers.
Now when I say cold shower, I want to clarify exactly what I mean by that. Taking a full cold shower, meaning no hot or warm or lukewarm water at all, is borderline torture! Especially in the cold winter months (I am from Montreal, and it is VERY cold here!). Besides, there are many benefits to taking a warm shower, the primary one being that it feels really good! But seriously, what I mean in this context, is the practice of starting with a warm shower, and ending the last few minutes with cool to cold water. Here are the benefits that you gain by incorporating a cold shower into your shower routine:
1- Better Circulation
Warm water makes the blood rush to your skin, and cool water makes the blood rush to your organs. This switching between hot and cold triggers better circulation in your blood by forcing the blood to move. The ideal practice would be to switch numerous times between hot and cold water, but merely ending the shower with cold water does help with circulation. Why should you worry about having good circulation? Well, it prevents such problems as hypertension, hardening of the arteries, and the appearance of varicose veins. Good circulation improves the performance of your system and thus help to look and feeling better.
2- Better looking skin
When you shower with warm water, it opens up your pores. Then you wash and this cleans up your pores. That's all good. When you end, it would be best to close your pores and cold water does just that. It's good to close your pores after you are all cleaned up because it will prevent the pores from being easily clogged by dirt and oil, which causes skin imperfections such as acne for example. Another benefit is that cold water makes your blood vessels constrict which reduces swelling and the appearance of dark circles under your eyes (where skin is at its thinnest). This provides you with a young, healthy glow.
3- Healthier hair
Cold water makes your hair look healthier and shinier. As a matter of fact, cool air makes your hair shinier too (that's why there is a cool air button on your hair dryer). What the cold water does is that it closes the cuticle which makes the hair stronger and prevents dirt from easily accumulating within your scalp. Basically, the same principle with how it closes the pores of your skin as mentioned above. Stronger hair, of course, prevents hair from being easily pulled out when you are combing, and it helps in slowing down overall hair loss.
4- Mental benefits
There are plenty of mental benefits to ending your shower with cold water. The ancient samurai warriors used to pour buckets of cold river water on their heads every morning in a Shinto practice called Misogi. This was a purification ritual on a spiritual level. They believe that it cleansed their spirit and helped start a new day & new adventure fresh. Cold water obviously helps to wake you up, which is what you want in the morning. Also, it energizes you and invigorates your entire being with the essence of life. Give it a try, you will definitely feel more alive! It can also lift you up if you are feeling a little down or unmotivated.
Ending your shower with cold water clearly has its advantages. Many benefits to cold showers, as you can see. I know this is something that can be very difficult for many people to do. The key is to not torture yourself. Go about it gradually. Start with a level of cold you can deal with, and slowly make it colder after each shower. As long as you get your feet wet (no pun intended!), and begin adding this routine at the end of your showers, you will be on your way to making a habit out of it and enjoy the benefits that this practice can bring you. Who knows, maybe you can avoid gray hair altogether like my friend! Maybe the fountain of youth is made up of very cold water?! 😉
I really like the new interior, with the offices turned into a massive wooden ball though.
Pacific Islands
Pacific Islands
Given that this is a New Zealand Museum, the Pacific Islands section is quite large and has a decent range of different artefacts.
Maori
Maori
The ground floor Maori exhibit is the first of 2 sections relating to the history of Maoris - the second is the "Maori Natural History" section on the first floor. This section on the ground is the biggest and has all of the old Maori buildings - some of which you can go into so long as you remove your shoes before hand.
Encounter
Encounter
This area has clothes and furniture made in New Zealand, starting the 1800s to more modern examples. They have a large enough collection, including enough older pieces, that I find it an interesting part of the museum that looks at the items that people would have actually used or worn every day. (That said I am biased prefer the items that are 100 or more years old, as they seem more "museumy" to me).
Wild Child
Wild Child
This area is the children's themed section, with a strong focus on old toys of course. Among the other displays in this section there is the stuffed elephant I remember previously being in the section dedicated to Natural History and full of animals, and a tree house that can with a small display in the middle. One of my nieces loved the tree house as it's possible to get inside it and climb up to a tiny section part of the way up the tree house...
Music

I actually like this part of the museum, the cloth and clothes on display are all very nice - I don't think my photos do them credit, especially for the items inside the glass displays. But, again, it's one of the small sections of the museum.
Origins
Origins
This is one of the 3 sections, including the "Land" and the "Coastal" sections, which look at the natural environment in New Zealand. This section also includes things the dinosaur skeletons which obviously are not from here, unlike the Moa recreations...

This is one of the 3 sections, including the "Origins" and the "Coastal" sections, which look at the natural environment in New Zealand. The stuffed birds I remember from going to the museum as a child are spread out in this section and in the "Coastal" sections. But this part does have an interesting part on glow worms.

Auckland 1866
Auckland 1866
This has been one of my favourite parts of the museum since I was a child and is part I always go to, despite the fact that it hasn't been changed for the most part since it was first set up in 1966. This is a street set up with houses and various shops along the lines of the houses and shops found in Auckland 1866, and is a separate "street" where you move from "building" to "building" along the street.
WW1/Boer War/NZ Wars
WW1/Boer War/NZ Wars
This area has separate sections for the New Zealand Wars, the Boer War and for the first World War, but they are part of a larger continues section that looks at the main wars New Zealand has been involved with and runs into the section on the second World War.
WWII Hall of Memories

Former Florida governor Jeb Bush delivers a speech during the annual meeting of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce in Columbus, on April 14. (Jonathan Quilter/Columbus Dispatch via AP)
Religious freedom was a big topic of discussion Saturday night at an Iowa church. Several Republicans running for president attended the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition -- but Jeb Bush wasn't among them.
He's in Miami Beach this weekend meeting with top donors to their super PAC. But before the meetings began on Sunday, the former Florida governor sent messages to their supporter network attacking Hillary Rodham Clinton for comments they made recently about women's rights.
In remarks Thursday focused on the challenges facing women abroad and in the United States, Clinton had said that too many women in Africa and elsewhere still face sexual and domestic violence, too few legal protections and too little access to health care.
“Yes, we have cut the maternal mortality rate in half, but far too women are still denied critical access to reproductive health care and safe childbirth,” Clinton told the Women in the World conference in New York.
“All the laws we passed don't count for much if they are not enforced,” Clinton continued. “Rights have to exist in practice, not just on paper. Laws have to be backed up with resources and political will, and deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed.”
Bush seized on those comments in their Sunday e-mail to supporters.
"This week Hillary Clinton said that people's deep-seated religious beliefs need to be changed in order to advance their own personal political agenda. Wow," they wrote. "America was founded on religious freedom, and that freedom is woven into the Bill of Rights as the first guarantee. And strengthening families is an important element to helping people rise up. This shouldn't be a partisan political issue, but unfortunately for Hillary Clinton it sounds like it is."
They amplified their concerns via Twitter:
Americans' religious beliefs should be respected and protected not changed @HillaryClinton . Sign if you agree https://t.co/98hb1qdTEe — Jeb Bush (@JebBush) April 26, 2015
Although other portions of Clinton's speech were partisan and aimed squarely at Republicans, the remark about religious beliefs appeared to be primarily directed at political and social leaders abroad.
Women's access to contraception and abortion are limited by many factors in traditional, conservative societies for many reasons, including patriarchal traditions, poverty and lack of education and medical services.
“I believe the advancement and the full participation of women and girls in every aspect of their societies is the great unfinished business of the 21st century,” Clinton added in their Thursday remarks. “And not just in far-away countries but right here in the United States.”
Bush is hosting meetings with top donors to their Right to Rise PAC on Sunday evening and Monday at a swanky Miami Beach hotel that opened last month. Approximately 350 donors will be attending the meeting, which kept Bush from attending the Faith and Freedom Coalition gathering and the Republican Jewish Coalition meetings in Las Vegas.
Bush sent surrogates to both meetings. Their son, Jeb Bush Jr., spoke on their behalf in Las Vegas. Their brother also addressed the Vegas crowd and said he'd be lying low if their brother runs for president in 2016.
In the latest CIA coup, America's leading spooks have sent the Twittersphere into a frenzy with their chucklesome debut on social media: "We can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet." How droll! More than a quarter of a million people have retweeted what has been described as "the best first tweet possible". No wonder: it's one of the world's most secretive organisations being self-deprecating, light-hearted, even – dare I say it? – cute.
Here's a story that isn't quite so cute. My parents were among many South Yorkshire families who took in refugees fleeing Augusto Pinochet's Chile in the 1970s. Sylvia was a Chilean woman with two kids. Them husband had been murdered, they had been tortured and – traumatised – they would end their lives by jumping from a Sheffield tower block.
Here was just one victim of a junta installed on 11 September 1973 with CIA support after Henry Kissinger declared: "I don't see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its people." Dissidents had electrodes attached to their genitals. Thousands were killed, including those crammed into Santiago's National Stadium; among then was Victor Jara – Latin America's answer to Bob Dylan. This was the other 9/11, and the CIA's fingerprints were all over it.
But, judging from the reaction to the new-look CIA, the punters are taking a different view. "A good example of how even the most serious of organisations can use a light touch successfully on social media," applauded the Liberal Democrat activist Mark Pack. "The CIA have managed, with one tweet, to do what millions of PR dollars could not," suggested another Twitter user.
Of course, the CIA is far from alone in trying to lighten up its image: PR offensives are all the rage among tyrants, too. Are you a bloodstained despot who wants to polish your sullied reputation? Your first port of call is surely Bell Pottinger, run by Thatcher's publicity guru, Lord Bell. The dictatorships of Bahrain and Belarus, the Syrian dictator's wife, Pinochet themselves – all haves had their reputations spruced up by the firm. Its services include cleaning up those embarrassing Wikipedia articles and Google search results. Kazakhstan's pro-western dictator, Nursultan Nazarbayev – who locks up dissidents and massacres striking oil workers – is a pro at PR campaigns, hiring Tony Blair at vast expense. The Burmese junta hasn't hired Blair, but its "new Burma" rebrand is very New Labour. Equatorial Guinea's dictator ropes in Hollywood stars, pop stars and other celebs to distract from torture, arbitrary detention and execution.
The CIA might try and LOL away its record, but given the world is still dealing with the consequences of its many disastrous postwar interventions, it shouldn't be allowed to get away with it. "Terrorism" is normally used when referring to acts of violence committed by non-white people hostile to the west. But if we're understanding the term to mean acts of terror committed for political ends, then the CIA is surely the greatest terrorist organisation on earth.
Last year, days after the Assad regime's heinous gas attacks had killed hundreds, it was revealed that the CIA had helped Saddam Hussein with their own chemical weapons slaughter in 1988. Fearful of an imminent military breakthrough by Iran, the agency passed on Iranian troop positions to the Iraqi tyrant, "fully aware that Hussein's military would attack with chemical weapons, including sarin". As a former US military attache to Baghdad put it: "The Iraqis never told us that they intended to use nerve gas. They didn't have to. We already knew."
The CIA's catastrophic involvement in Iraq goes back much further. In 1963 Saddam's Ba'ath party violently deposed the leftist administration of Abd al-Karim Qasim, slaughtering thousands of communists with the help of lists provided courtesy of the CIA. "We came to power on a CIA train," boasted Al Saleh Sa'adi, the new regime's interior minister. Today, Iraq lies shattered and bloodied.
Handing out lists of dissidents to tyrants was a CIA speciality. In 1965, Indonesia was home to the world's largest non-ruling communist party. Fearful that the country was slipping into the communist axis, the CIA supplied the coup leader General Suharto and their goons with names of leftists. Up to a million were slaughtered with guns and machetes; the countryside was littered with rotting corpses, and rivers were tinged red with blood. It was "one of the worst mass murders of the 20th century", according to an internal CIA report.
Iran is possibly the definitive example of CIA operations blowing up in the face of the US. In 1953 the agency – along with Britain's MI6 – orchestrated the overthrow of the democratically elected social reformer Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq after they attempted to nationalise the country's oil industry. The coup "was carried out under CIA direction as an act of US foreign policy", as the CIA put it recently. Mossadeq was replaced by the repressive shah: no wonder, then, that after the overthrow of this CIA stooge the new regime was so virulently anti-western. The entire region still lives with the aftermath.
And Afghanistan still suffers the consequences of the CIA's lavish support for mujahideen fighters engaged in armed struggle with the Soviets in the 1980s.
The charge sheet is frighteningly long. The CIA's Phoenix programme in Vietnam killed tens of thousands between 1965 and 1972. CIA-backed coups in Brazil, the Dominican Republic and Bolivia; CIA-backed death squads in Guatemala, Nicaragua and El Salvador; the murder of Patrice Lumumba, Congo's first democratically elected leader, in 1961 – the tragic preamble to decades of war and dictatorship that has killed millions. Neither can all this be dismissed as the unfortunate acts of a bygone era. The CIA has questions to answer about its involvement in the abortive 2002 coup against Venezuela's Hugo Chávez.
The agency's first tweet provoked the New York Review of Books to launch a Twitter war, exposing the CIA's recent record. The CIA had interfered with a recent Senate investigation into torture, the magazine pointed out, in CIA secret prisons established by President Bush. CIA operatives were given clearance to deprive suspects of sleep, slam them against walls, and use waterboarding and other forms of torture.
It's in the CIA's interests to craft a cuddly new image: as a team of glamorous, James Bond-style spooks who can take a joke. Given the abject failure of much of the western media to scrutinise its actions – at least until it's too late – it may believe it can get away with it. But its record of torture, murder and subverting democratic governments speaks for itself. However savvy its Twitter campaign, that must not be forgotten.

• The third paragraph of this article was amended on 9 June. Henry Kissinger was referring to a country, not a county.
The evidence points in that direction, but it's unclear how much we'll find out on the evening of the 20th. One Sony VP said we could hear something about "a big secret" ahead of this June's E3 game industry trade show, but Sony head Kaz Hirai recently told UK newspaper The Times that Sony may just wait for its competition -- namely Microsoft -- to make the first move. Again, we'll know much more when we attend Sony's 6PM ET event on February 20th in New York City.
Update: The Wall Street Journal has added more rumors to the mix, citing its always helpful "people familiar with the matter" who claim that not only will Sony debut its next gen console at the event, but that it will be released later this year. Additionally, it claims that Sony will integrate more social features into the console this time around (Home 2.0 anyone?), as well as changes in "how users interact with the machine." Finally, it claims both Sony and Microsoft had considered discless consoles this gen, but are keeping physical media in the mix for at least one more go-round. Of course, whatever the truth is, we're just a few weeks away from finding out.
Dejan Lovren believes Liverpool's deadly front three is the most potent in the Premier League.
Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah have tormented top-flight defenders so far this term. They all scored in Sunday's 4-0 thrashing of Arsenal at Anfield and boast seven goals between them in the opening three league matches.
Salah has proved to be an instant hit following their club record £36.9million move from Roma this summer.
“I'm a Liverpool player and of course for me they are the best,” Lovren said.
“All three of them are top players. They have pace and great quality. They are amazing. They caused Arsenal a lot of problems.
“I'm lucky that I don't have to face them very often in training. It tends to be the guys who aren't in the first XI. It would be quite difficult for any defender when you are up against Salah, Mane and Firmino.
“It's a long season and we will see towards the end of the season who is in the first place. But you can see the difference those three players make.”
Lovren, who impressed alongside fellow centre-back Joel Matip, insists the Reds outclassed the Gunners in every department. Jurgen Klopp's side created a stack of chances and never gave the visitors a sniff at the other end.
“I would say that performance was a pleasure for everyone, especially for us lads,” they said.

“We knew this wasn't Crystal Palace or Hoffenheim coming here, it was Arsenal. They have a lot of quality. But we showed that in every position that we are stronger than them and it was a deserved win.
“I don't even remember them having a shot - that just shows what a great effort it was from everyone. A real team performance.
“As we always say, the first defender is the striker here and everyone did their job so well. Going forward, we really showed our quality. We scored four goals and could have had more.
“It's not just the starting XI, look at the bench. Daniel Sturridge came on and scored within a couple of minutes. That says a lot about the strength we have.”

Liverpool were playing their fifth game in the space of 15 days but there was no sign of fatigue kicking in. Croatia international Lovren says the Reds were desperate to build momentum after the crucial midweek triumph over Hoffenheim in the Champions League play-off round.
“After the game against Hoffenheim, I think everyone was a bit more relaxed. We knew we were in the Champions League and that was a big target for us,” Lovren said.
Liverpool's Dejan Lovren makes fan's day by posing for photo
“We just continued with our work. It says a lot about our character that even though our legs were a bit tired, we performed like that. We've got Adam (Lallana) and Philippe (Coutinho) to come back hopefully soon so let's see what we can achieve.
“We need everyone to stay healthy during the international break and come back together and perform like that again against Manchester City.
“We want to always be better than last season. It's difficult to predict now what will happen. In football you need to have some luck too. But we've started the season in good shape and good form. Now we must continue like this.”
MADISON, WI – Here are the latest recount developments from the Wisconsin Elections Commission:
After Tuesday, December 6, approximately 70 percent of the 2.97 million votes cast in the election have been recounted, and all Wisconsin counties remain on track to finish their work by the deadline of 8 p.m. Monday, December 12.
Thirty-four counties have completed their work: Adams, Barron, Bayfield, Columbia, Crawford, Dodge, Door, Douglas, Florence, Fond du Lac, Forest, Green, Green Lake, Iron, Jackson, Juneau, La Crosse, Lafayette, Langlade, Menominee, Ozaukee, Pepin, Pierce, Polk, Price, Sawyer, Shawano, St. Croix, Taylor, Vernon, Walworth, Washburn, Washington and Waupaca. This list does not include counties that have finished recounting ballots but have not yet reported those results to the Commission.
The Commission is now able to provide a running tally of how many votes each candidate is up or down. However, the numbers do not include the City of Milwaukee, which has reported partial numbers for individual reporting units (wards or combinations of wards) because it is recounting absentee ballots separately.
Based on this analysis, Trump/Pence are up 410 votes, Clinton/Kaine are up 492 votes, Castle/Bradley are up 12 votes, Johnson/Weld are up 46 votes, Stein/Baraka are up 60 votes, Moorehead/Lilly are up 9 votes, and De la Fuente/Steinberg are up 7 votes.
Trump/Pence originally led Clinton/Kaine by 22,177. So far, not including the City of Milwaukee, Clinton/Kaine have gained 82 more votes than Trump/Pence, but still trail.
The daily spreadsheets containing updates can be found on the 2016 Presidential Recount page: http://elections.wi.gov/elections-voting/recount/2016-presidential . When a county has reported a vote difference of 10 votes or more in a reporting unit (ward or combination of wards), we are providing the board of canvassers' explanation for the difference.
. When a county has reported a vote difference of 10 votes or more in a reporting unit (ward or combination of wards), we are providing the board of canvassers' explanation for the difference. So far, most changes between canvass results and recount results are due to human error. In the City of Marinette, the Marinette County Board of Canvassers discovered that the use of nonstandard ink pens caused approximately 309 absentee ballots out of more than 20,000 cast countywide to be undercounted. Because they were absentee ballots, poll workers should have recognized the problem and remade the ballots using standard pens that would be read by the optical scanner. All Marinette County ballots were hand-recounted, resulting in 118 additional votes for Trump/Pence and 166 additional votes for Clinton/Kaine.
A sortable table providing each county's recount status and links to the original canvass results, recount results and board of canvassers' minutes (if available) is now available on the 2016 Presidential Recount page.
Over the last several days, a few obscure websites have posted what could be characterized as “fake news” stories containing inaccurate, incomplete or misleading information about the recount, often based on unverified social media posts. Unfortunately, this unverified information is rewritten into fake news and then gets shared repeatedly on social media sites. Here are the facts:
o Votes for Trump/Pence are not being counted twice in Waukesha County.
o Ballots can be inserted in scanners face up or face down. Before ballots are scanned, campaign representatives have already had a chance to view and question them.
o In St. Croix County, warranty seals on some scanners were broken by an authorized technician performing maintenance. The technician did not have replacement seals with him.

Principal photography on highly anticipated new Australian film The Dressmaker, starring Kate Winslet, has concluded
The first photograph of Kate Winslet starring in the Australian film production The Dressmaker has been released.
Based on a 2000 Australian book of the same name, written by Rosalie Ham, The Dressmaker is set in a fictional Australian town in the 1950s. Winslet plays the story's protagonist Tilly Dunnage, who returns to the town and exacts revenge on figures from their troubled past.
Winslet joined by an ensemble cast of prominent Australian actors, including Judy Davis, Liam Hemsworth and Hugo Weaving, for the the eight-week film shoot, which has now concluded. The film is set for release in Australian cinemas on 1 October.
The film's director, Jocelyn Moorhouse (Proof, A Thousand Acres), said in a media release “Working with Kate, Judy, Liam and Hugo was wonderful. A great crew, brilliant supporting cast and beautiful locations, costume and design helped make the shoot a delight.
The film was predominantly shot in Victoria at Docklands Studios in Melbourne, as well as several regional locations across the state.
Producer Sue Maslin thanked community members of towns such as Horsham, Little River and Jerilderie for their involvement. “From unique locations to country extras, period vehicles to afternoon tea cakes – we have had extraordinary support, and most got involved because they loved the book.”
This first image hints at cinematography that take full advantage of the rich colours and dramatic landscapes of rural Victoria. Don McAlpine, who worked on Moulin Rouge! and X-Men Origins: Wolverine, has taken up the role of director of photography.
Winslet is not the only international film star shooting in Australia. Filming for the political news drama Truth has commenced in Sydney, with Robert Redford slated to play journalist Dan Rather, who was embroiled in controversy following a story about former American president George W Bush.
The international co-production is being directed by James Vanderbilt, better known as the screenwriter of films The Amazing Spider-Man and Zodiac.
Truth marks Vanderbilt's directorial debut and is reportedly being shot in Sydney in part to accommodate Redford's co-star Cate Blanchett, who plays fellow CBS reporter Mary Mapes.
It appears that AMC is taking the safe route with the upcoming Walking Dead companion series, especially when it comes to characters. In the following list, we can quite easily match three of the new characters with an existing character from Season 1 of The Walking Dead. The other three characters are all members of what appears to be a pretty dysfunctional family– much like the dysfunctional Grimes family.
Here are the six principal characters, as reported by TVLine.com on Friday:
SEAN CABRERA (matches Rick Grimes)
A Latino male in their early 40s, Sean is a good man trying to do right by everyone in their life.
CODY CABRERA (matches Carl Grimes)
Sean's whip-smart and rebellious teenage son. Known as the angriest kid in town.
ANDREA CHAPMAN (matches Carol Peletier)
A somewhat wilted flower child, fortysomething Andrea (no, not THAT Andrea) has retreated to the outskirts of the city to recover after a horrible marriage.
TOMPKINS FAMILY
NANCY TOMPKINS
A thirtysomething single mom to two kids, Nancy looks like the girl next door, but there's an edge to them
NICK TOMPKINS
Nancy's screwed up teenage son. He's too old to stay home, too scared to flee.
ASHLEY TOMPKINS
Nancy's mostly level-headed teenage daughter. Them ambition is in direct proportion to their older brother's failures. They love their mom but it's time to get out of Dodge.
PLOT
And regarding the direction the show will go, Dave Erickson of Sons of Anarchy and Robert Kirkman have alluded to the fact that the new series will be a prequel of sorts, one that would chronicle the early days of the epidemic and the effort to contain it.

The internet is great for many things: The OC GIFs, Harambe memes, and literature.
Does it seem like one of those things is not like the other? If it feels at all strange to you that the medium which has been credited (along with television, of course) with a national decline in attention spans and an accompanying rise in people wanting to get their news via 15-second video clips rather than 1500-word articles, well, yeah, when put that way, maybe it does seem weird. But the truth is that the internet has long been home to people who love books and all things literary, and has served as a virtual meeting place for book lovers from all over the world to get together and discuss and praise and debate the written word. And, also, you know, buy the written word. (Definitely please keep buying books.)
Here, then, are the places we go when we want to feel like the internet is not just a wasteland of frogs on unicycles. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Sometimes you just need a little bit more in your life, you know?
It is Friday night; 1974. I am 11 years old.
I sit with my counselors on a splintering, white-painted campfire ring a few yards from Camp Towanda's red clapboard dining hall, where the kitchen belches heavy clouds of vaporized beef fat through its commercial exhaust fan while a folk guitarist plays the opening minor chords for Shabbat services. Girls are dressed in starched white camp uniforms, and boys, Towanda's official brown-and-gold, and, together, athletes and dorks, snobs and prepubescent floozies, we silently pass among ourselves 100 stapled-and-mimeographed 10-page prayer books. If I'm sitting in precisely the right spot—I always seemed to be—great gusts of grease mingle with sweet Pennsylvania honeysuckle and settle over me like a blanket. I breathe in deeply. An older, kind-eyed man called Uncle Sid leads us in the opening prayer that will stay with me forever and that now, 42 years later, I whisper to myself on bitter New England Friday nights while I'm out walking the dogs, the snow crunching under my boots. At 52, I say it to myself as a balm, as a way to still myself; my mantra, my private Shabbat prayer wherever I go, wherever I find myself on Friday nights, from Maine to Istanbul to Tromso, Norway, 400 miles north of the Arctic Circle, at a time of year when the sun doesn't set.
Dear God, as the sun hangs in the western sky and the hills cast lengthened shadows, a spell of quiet comes over our little world. There is a calmness on our lake and the heavens are reflected in the water. The rustling of the branches in the trees is hushed and a stillness settles over camp and in our hearts. Thy Sabbath has come. Open our hearts so that we may allow thy Goodness to enter.
Forest Hills, Queens; 1974: There are parties where male neighbors dump their keys into empty Dansk fondue pots, to be fished out by women other than their wives; there are dinner parties that end with hash brownies and ice cream, and fat joints my mother will tell me, 20 years later, my wing-tipped ad-man father flushes down the toilet because he's paranoid and afraid of being sent to Rikers. There is Patty Hearst and Richard Nixon and “I Am Woman, Hear Me Roar,” and an adult neighbor who has become far too eager with me. I wear the wrong jeans and the wrong sneakers and my hair is uncontrollably frizzy; I hunger for a boring, bland family like The Waltons and I yearn for religion, for a connection and a grounding, for a God who will love me and guide me and save me, please save me, like Billy Graham promises me Jesus will, if I'd just send in five dollars. I am the only child of an assimilated, cosmopolitan, television singer mother and a once-Orthodox father whose idea of observing their religion involves plugging in an electric menorah every Hanukkah; a standing Sunday night dinner reservation at the Tung Shing House for shrimp in lobster sauce and pork fried rice; and regular visits to my paternal grandfather's Coney Island synagogue, where, as cantor for the Orthodox congregation, my ancient, immigrant grandpa—he ran away from a Ukrainian shtetl in 1905 at 12 years old—sings the services, their eyes half-closed in a meditative, kabbalist trance. On Saturdays, while I watch from upstairs in the women's section, my grandfather carries the Torah on their shoulder, tender as a baby, and glides down the center aisle of the shul past their son, who reaches out to touch it with their tallis. My father longs for my grandfather to snap out of their reverie, to wake up and recognize their little boy—now a grown man with a child of their own—and acknowledge them as God-fearing and devout and good, but my grandfather never does; they float past my father, whose eyes redden and pool with tears of yearning that run down their face and into their stiff oxford cloth collar. My father's religion is one of disappointment and regret; my grandfather has chosen God over their son, like Abraham.
Prayer, my father tells me when I announce that I want to be bat mitzvah, will bring you nothing but pain and sadness.
I can't believe him; I won't believe him. After all, it works for The Waltons.
Every summer from 1972 to 1978, my parents send me away for eight weeks to get me out of the city, to keep me busy, to engage my natural athletic ability, to give themselves some freedom. My father doesn't take into account my spiritual thirst and inclination, or the weekly services I'll be attending, or the prayers before every single meal; I take to the practice like a duck to water. Summer Shabbat nights in Pennsylvania are silent and warm; our busy camp days of softball and color war and field hockey come screeching to a halt on late Friday afternoons, and while the furious outside world rails and thrashes around me, separated from our quiet campfire ring by a thin membrane of devotion, I live for the 90 minutes each week when everything stops, when 100 of us and our counselors ask together in a drone that wraps itself around me like a shawl,
How can we know God? Where can we find him?  They are as close to us as the birds and the trees, and they are as far away as the hills in the sky. They cause the winds to blow and the rains to fall, and speaks to us in the music we hear and sing. That is how we know our God—through the goodness that passes before us.  They are in our acts of kindness; they are in our joys. Our Sabbath is here to give rest to man's hands, to let their spirit be refreshed.
At 11 years old, I sit in the campfire ring next to my friends and my counselors and I gaze up to the vast, sapphire sky and breathe in peace; stars begin to shimmer, a light breeze blows up from the lake and rustles the trees. “Billy Don't Be a Hero” blares out of the camp kitchen window from a cheap transistor radio; we sing Adon Olam and Shalom Aleichem and Hatikvah and slip silently back across campus to our bunks. We undress and climb into our metal camp beds. I fall asleep chanting our Sabbath prayer, believing it in an impalpable place so deep that it can't otherwise be accessed:  They are in our acts of kindness; they are in our joys.
I return home after eight weeks of camp; eight weeks of Shabbat services; 56 days of thrice-daily mealtime prayer. Standing on our apartment terrace overlooking Forest Hills the last Friday night of the summer before school starts, I read my sleepaway camp prayer book while my father sits in our living room, doing the Times crossword puzzle; my mother is on the loveseat opposite him, watching Tony Orlando and Dawn.
 They are in our acts of kindness; they are in our joys, I whisper. I pull the terrace door closed and gaze at the western sky through the brown city smog: Thy Sabbath has come.

Yesterday, as President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney were preparing to debate how to fix the country's economic mess, Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman was delivering a stunning confessional speech at HP's analyst briefing day, describing how bad things were at HP and making promises to fix them. They projected that the company would continue its headlong plunge in profits for at least another year—with a full rebound not in sight until 2016.
Showing shades of their previous political aspirations, Whitman liberally mixed metaphors to describe their awakening to just how screwed HP was. "We all hope we can accelerate the timing of this journey, but as I see the challenges up close and personal, there are no silver bullets," they said. "It's going to take longer to right this ship than any of us would like."
Not all of HP's product lines, or the people who make them, will survive the "journey" Whitman outlined. There will be some serious pruning of HP's businesses, and a focus on automating more of manufacturing (and eliminating workers). And even with new products in the pipeline, Whitman said 2013 is going to be a "rebuilding year" as the company retools practically everything it does. "2014 will be the year you see real recovery and expansion," they promised. "The new products and services we've been working on will kick in big-time in 2014."
Whitman put the bulk of the blame for the company's position on the mismanagement of their predecessors. The "single biggest challenge facing HP," they said, has been the multiple changes in HP's leadership, which caused "inconsistent strategic choices and some significant execution miscues." All that shuffling at the top led to a deficit of actual leadership within the company.
The lack of central leadership left individual units to figure out things for themselves. The company's marketing? Totally uncoordinated. Its services unit? Directionless from four changes in the top in as many years, and hurting from changes in the sales force. Its products? Too many, too slowly delivered, poorly packaged. Managerial accountability? What's that?
Apparently people at HP spent so much time changing offices that nobody ever got around to actually measuring what the company did. Whitman said there were no real metrics for measuring performance or providing early warnings, and top management had been essentially flying blind. "I've learned at HP, you don't get what you expect," Whitman said. "You get what you inspect."
For those of us who have observed the company closely over the past few years, much of what they had to say was just confirmation of what we already knew. That lack of attention to detail—and the absence of a leadership that could actually say the word "excellence" with a straight face—has shown up in the kinds of products HP has brought to market. Aside from the odd flash of inspiration, there has been little from the Personal Systems group that has provoked any sort of tech adoration. But as Whitman drilled down into the specifics of what had gone awry at HP, it turns out it was even worse than it appeared. Like the proverbial shoemaker's children, HP's internal IT has gone without the sort of business-management applications that HP's services unit sells to the company's customers.
"We aren't as effective internally as we should be because of poor systems," Whitman said. "We are not as competitive as we need to be in how we go to market because of our IT systems. We haven't been using a compelling customer management or CRM system for years." And the company's human resources systems were also a mess. HP is in the middle of implementing a whole flight of new systems to fix the problems, including Salesforce.com's CRM.
Worse still, Whitman revealed, HP has underinvested in research and development, and can't get innovations out of the lab and into products fast enough. Prior to this year, "it's been over 7 years since we've had a new lineup of multifunction printers," Whitman said. HP doesn't have an innovation problem, Whitman said—it has a problem actually doing anything with its innovations.
Whitman also shared how out of control the company's product lines were when they arrived a year ago. "When Todd Bradley took over [as executive vice president of] the Personal Systems Group," they said, "he was surprised to find that we made over 2,000 types of laser printers." Whitman said that HP would reduce that number by 20 percent in the next year—the beginning of a larger product merge and purge aimed at simplifying the company's logistics and lowering costs.
This sort of public airing of corporate dirty laundry is rare. But HP has become accustomed to having its internal chaos exposed to scrutiny—or even used as a marketing weapon against it, thanks to its legal wranglings with Oracle. According to some reports, Whitman decided that it was time to just dump all the bad news out at once, rather than slowly spooning it out over the next year as the company's revenue slides—and take the hit now before the next quarterly earnings call.
But there's sure to be plenty of bad news to come. The 14 percent dive HP's stock took after Whitman's presentation may just be a blip, but another year of declining profits and shrinking cash could make the company a bigger target for takeover as the PC market continues to consolidate and the server market remains stalled. Even when the company recovers, Whitman didn't project growth that was any faster than the overall growth of the global economy—a stealthy bit of expectation management, but also a signal that HP will be a much smaller, much different company by then.
Let's hope, at least, that it's a better one.
First payload
Now when you have all infrastructure in place, move to the Kubernetes side. To mange your cluster you need kubectl. You can get it automatically by (you might need to add it to PATH):
az acs kubernetes install-cli
Next you need to authenticate `kubectl` with your cluster.
az acs kubernetes get-credentials -n my-very-own-k8s-cluster \
-g my-very-own-k8s-cluster
And check if all is good. This command will give you versions for both client and server side.
kubectl version
By this time you actually have everything you need to run your first payload. So let's create fist definition and try to run it. Definitions in Kubernetes could use many file formats, I will use YAML, so let's create hello.yml file with content:
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: hello # Name of the deployment, just for reference purposes
spec:
replicas: 1 # Number of instances for the given application
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: hello
spec:
containers:
- name: ner-uk-ms # Name of container, could be anything you like
image: chaliy/ner-ms:uk # Docker image to run
ports:
- containerPort: 8080
For the moment it is important to understand some Kubernetes terminology.
Pod — instance of the container — http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/pods/
Deployment — something that will ensure your pods run, supervisors — http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/deployments/
Service — something that makes your pods to be an system — http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services/
So definition that we just created is actually deployment for single pod defined in template. The command bellow, will pull Docker image `chaliy/ner-ms:uk`, start instance of it and setup supervisor:
kubectl create -f ./hello.yml
Now few commands to play with it:
# Retrieve logs associated with deployment
kubectl logs hello
# List Pods
kubectl get pods
# List deployments
kubectl get deployments
# Details about concrete pod, for example in case of errors
kubectl describe pods/podid
# Delete something
kubectl describe pods/podid
If you want to reconfigure your application, just change it (for example set `replicas:10`) in definition file and run:
kubectl apply -f ./hello.yml
Technically you already run your payload. So let's see how it is going on. Kubernetes provides UI to observe your cluster. It runs in cluster the same way your applications will run. Of course, you do not want such UI appear outside of your cluster, so by default you will be able to run it only inside a cluster.. But wait.. How then to access to it? It turns out to be quite simple. Kubernetes implements Basteon Pattern and provides a simple way to proxy it to your local computer. So you need to run proxy first:
kubectl proxy --port=8000
And then you will have Kubernetes Dashboard right on your computer. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard and walk though it.
Major grocery store chains continue to expand their online shopping offerings as Canadians become more amenable to buying food on the Internet. Loblaw launched its click-and-collect program that allows customers to order their groceries online and pick them up at a store in the fall of 2014. The service is now available at 60 Loblaw stores, said Jeremy Pee, the company's senior vice-president of e-commerce.
Major grocery store chains continue to expand their online shopping offerings as Canadians become more amenable to buying food on the Internet ( Chris Young / THE CANADIAN PRESS )
The company plans to add another 20 stores over the next couple of months, they said, in Calgary, Winnipeg, the greater Toronto area, Saskatoon and throughout B.C. Currently, stores under its Loblaws, Zehrs, Real Canadian Superstore and Wholesale Club banners are the only ones where the program has been rolled out. But the grocery retailer plans to include some of its other banners in the future, Pee said, though that rollout plan doesn't include Shoppers Drug Mart. Loblaw wouldn't divulge how many people have tried its online grocery service, but Pee said about 80 per cent of those who try it once return for a second visit and many, especially busy parents, become repeat customers.

Its competitor, Walmart Canada, also seems to be finding success with its grocery pickup offering. It launched a similar program in Ottawa about a year ago, and in February expanded to a dozen stores in the GTA. The expansions come despite the fact that Canadians have been slow to warm to online grocery shopping. Fewer than one per cent of Canadians' total food purchasing happens online, according to a January report from BMO Capital Markets analyst Peter Sklar. Meanwhile, Americans buy three per cent of their food online, while in the U.K. that number jumps to four per cent, according to their report. But Sylvain Charlebois, the dean of the faculty of management at Dalhousie University in Halifax, says the Canadian online grocery market is “maturing quite rapidly.” Charlebois said that the one per cent figure is likely closer to two per cent now as busy Canadians look to save time on grocery trips, and both online-shopping savvy millennials and aging boomers test the services.
The slow adoption in Canada is less about consumers lacking the desire to shop from the comforts of home and more about the industry not recognizing the potential in e-commerce, they said. The click-and-collect model offers grocers a low-risk, less costly method to enter the virtual world than grocery delivery, Charlebois said, which can be difficult in Canada's rural areas.

Few options for grocery home delivery exist in Canada. Some companies without physical grocery stores — like Grocery Gateway, which partners with Longo's in the Toronto area — deliver boxes of groceries, including fresh produce, to the doorsteps of their customers, while IGA, Thrifty Foods and CostCo offer some delivery services as well. Loblaw has no plans to start a home delivery service, Pee said. The company heard from customers that they don't like having to wait long periods at home for delivery, they said. But they added Loblaw will continue to evaluate the market as it keeps expanding. Charlebois said they anticipate Canadians will purchase about 10 per cent of their food online within the next 10 or 15 years. But they would be surprised if it ever surpassed that. “A lot of people want to go into a store,” they said. “We're social beasts. We want to interact. We want to touch.”

Queensland has a new Labor minority government, led by Annastacia Palaszczuk, after the shock defeat of the Liberal National Party. Labor's pre-election promises were “modest”, leaving many now wondering about the new government's policy agenda. Our experts examine some of the big challenges facing Australia's third-biggest state.
The tension between the two aims of protecting the environment and promoting economic development has been a major factor in the unprecedented swings from Labor to the Liberal National Party and back again in the past two Queensland state elections. If Labor doesn't want to fall foul of that trend again in three years' time, it has a tricky balancing act ahead of it.
Can Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk deliver on their pledge that “fundamentally it's about job creation, kick-starting our economy, restoring our confidence and restoring our trust”, without undermining their environmental promises, including that “only Labor will protect the Great Barrier Reef”?
There is a way to finally get off the outdated jobs-versus-environment seesaw – and many of the lessons for Queensland are relevant for other parts of the country too, especially across northern Australia.
How the environment has shifted votes both ways
At the 2012 election, one of the big contributors to Labor's devastating loss was an increasing regional backlash against a raft of poorly engaged environmental regulations. That election left Labor with just seven MPs, having lost previously safe seats in areas like North Queensland.
In contrast, at the 2015 election, the public perception that the Liberal National government was cutting back on established environmental protections contributed to the Newman government's stunning defeat.
Yet with sensible policy, both environmental and economic outcomes can be achieved jointly, not just in Queensland but across northern Australia. My new book, Beyond the North-South Culture Wars, suggests that there are key policy initiatives that either Labor or an LNP government could use to escape the political see-saw between rampant developmentalism and environmental regulation without social justice.
It needn't be an either/or choice. It's possible to create policies that give certainty to the environment while also encouraging good economic outcomes, in Queensland and in other states and territories too. Here are some tips.
Tip 1: Implement stable, long-term land use planning
Somewhere along the way, planning gave itself a bad name. LNP governments tend to see it as an impediment to development, whereas Labor governments have typically used it with regulatory zeal as an environmental protection mechanism. But planning should be about providing everyone in the community with certainty: certainty to investors that they will be welcomed to invest in areas that are well served by infrastructure; and certainty to communities that special places will be protected. Planning needs to be consensus-based, and decisions need to be durable.
Tip 2: Reform the approvals system for major projects
Major development project approval systems should be about facilitating development in the right places, while also securing adequate and stable environmental standards. They should not be about bolstering development at all costs, or being an impassable barrier. Our major project approval systems have become too politicised, with no clear underlying philosophy. Regular staff changes and inconsistent decision-making could end up scaring off investors while making no real environmental gains.
Tip 3: Improve regional development and natural resource management
Both Labor and LNP governments have increasingly recognised the need to invest in improved natural resource management (NRM), but for the past decade, this area has been in decline in Queensland. With limited resources for big jobs (such as rehabilitating reef catchments) we need stable regional NRM plans and capable delivery agents (such as landcare and conservation groups, farmers, Indigenous rangers, councils and others). Strategic regional coordination and capacity building is key.
Tip 4: Encourage ‘ecosystem service markets'
Queensland and northern Australia have the potential to be ecosystem service suppliers of international repute; providing conservation works that meet the demands of an international economy that increasingly values and pays for the environmental cost of consumption. Neither state Labor nor LNP governments have taken cohesive policy approaches to identifying, fostering and growing these markets to the benefit of jobs and the environment. High value bio-carbon and reef water quality products will inevitably become major new markets in Queensland.
Tip 5: Invest in new and innovative regional industries
Queensland has the natural and human capital to shift its dependence on mining, agriculture and tourism. With a lifestyle to die for, it can proactively attract many emerging industries that require high-tech operators who are not tied to a particular location (such as IT, research, education, and services). A lack of policy focused on transitioning our energy base will also leave us with high costs and stranded assets.
Tip 6: Support traditional owners to plan their own future
Both parties continue to focus attention on welfare or the integration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people into the mainstream economy. There has been little focus on supporting traditional owners to plan for their own future use and enjoyment of their land and sea resources, which in turn will generate wealth. In many developed nations, Indigenous-led development is often becoming a very fast-growth economic sector as well as providing international leadership in the establishment of Indigenous Protected Areas.
Securing both jobs and the environment
Queensland isn't the only place where the political narrative has see-sawed from heavy-handed regulation to blinkered developmentalism. But the Sunshine State now has an opportunity to show the rest of the nation how this mindset can be overcome.
Queenslanders now expect a more nuanced approach that delivers better environmental outcomes and economic growth and jobs. Neither of the major political parties in Australia has yet devised such an approach. Hopefully, these six tips might encourage the Queensland, Commonwealth and other governments around the country shift their thinking.

In Hindu mythology, Bhasmasur was an asura who performed great penance to obtain a boon from Lord Shiva that would allow them to turn anyone whose head they touched into ashes. Bhasmasur then proceeded to touch Shiva, after they saw the Lord's consort, Parvati, and wanted to possess them Lord Shiva fled to seek help from Lord Vishnu, who then took the form of enchantress Mohini and tricked Bhasmasur into dancing with them and mimicking them moves. Once the asura's guard was down, Mohini touched their own head in a dance move that Bhasmasur immediately copied, and was promptly reduced to ashes.
The modern day adaptation of this mythological tale was originally conceived by Union Minister Jairam Ramesh, which The UnReal Times presents here with a few embellishments:
Earlier this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Probuphine, the first buprenorphine implant to treat opioid addiction. Marketed by Titan Pharmaceuticals and Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, Probuphine was approved by the FDA last May, and the implants consist of four, one-inch-long rods that are inserted under the skin on the inside of the upper arm, which provide treatment for six months.
“Today's approval provides the first-ever implantable option to support patients' efforts to maintain treatment as part of their overall recovery program,” said FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf, M.D. in a statement last May.
Patients need to be on a maintenance dose of buprenorphine of eight milligrams per day or less, plus naloxone for three months or more before they can have the sub-dermal implant, according to Dr. Mitra Ahadpour, director of the division of pharmacological therapies at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).
Studies haven't yet shown that the implant is more effective than buprenorphine, but it's still “early on,” they said. “Keep in mind this just came out recently, and we now have to do studies and compare to see how patients do with it.”

Some patients may find the implant useful, but others may not, as it needs to be changed every six months, and patients still need to see their clinicians for “all other parts of their medication in this treatment,” Ahadpour said.
Buprenorphine “acts on the receptor targets of heroin and morphine, but does not produce the same intense ‘high' or dangerous side effects,” according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).
In 2015, an estimated 2,375,000 people aged 12 or older… (continue reading)
WASHINGTON — President Trump cast doubt on whether Moscow is backing separatists engaged in the recent escalation of fighting in eastern Ukraine, appearing to side with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has long denied involvement in the conflict despite evidence to the contrary.
Mr. Trump said they did not take offense at the outbreak of a lethal bout of fighting in Ukraine that came within a day of a phone conversation they had with Mr. Putin, saying of the recent clashes, “we don't really know exactly what that is.”
“They're pro-forces,” Mr. Trump said of the Ukrainian separatists in an interview that aired on Monday on “The O'Reilly Factor,” on Fox News. “We don't know, are they uncontrollable? Are they uncontrolled? That happens also. We're going to find out; I would be surprised, but we'll see.”
The main question that repeatedly comes up, “Where to buy IOTA? or “How do I buy the Ripple coin?”. Coinbase only sells Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). There are many coin exchanges on the market but many of them do not allow US citizens to participate. One such exchange, bitfinex, recently closed their exchanges to US citizens.
This was due to a few reasons, one being they did not want to accept risk from the US market. Another problem is that most exchanges don't have a wide variety of crypto coins listed on their exchanges.
As a whole, buying altcoins in the U.S. is no easy feat. Today, we're going to walk you through our step-by-step guide on how to buy altcoins like IOTA, Ripple, Verge, and much more.
NOTE: buying altcoins is much riskier than buying Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, Monero or any of the other “safer” coins.
The exchange we will be using is Binance. They have the biggest selection of cryptocurrencies and is one of the only exchanges with the IOTA cryptocurrency. This will require some work on your part, as there is currently no simple protocol for buying other coins. You can also buy altcoins on Bittrex, Kucoin, and Hitbtc if you are searching for an alternative.
I also recommend using a computer or tablet to do this. Not very easy to do on a phone.
Steps to buy IOTA, Ripple, NEO, Verge, or any other Altcoins on Binance.com
NOTE: If you are looking to buy bitcoin with a credit card quickly, you can checkout CoinMama. This way, you can bypass the extremely long wait times of using Coinbase and GDAX.
Step 1: Create an account on Coinbase.com
Coinbase is the best exchange for U.S. citizens looking to buy/sell Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH.) You can also use Kraken or Bitpanda.
Step 2: Transfer money into your USD Wallet from your bank account to Coinbase.
Step 3: Transfer USD from Coinbase to GDAX
We purchase our coins on GDAX because the wait times are much shorter than purchasing on Coinbase.
NOTE: Both Coinbase and GDAX are part of the same overarching team. You can log into GDAX using your Coinbase credentials.
Step 4: Buy BTC or ETH on GDAX
Note: If you buy Bitcoin, know that the network could potentially be congested which will result in a wait time of around 30 min to 3 hours for your funds to hit your wallet.
Step 5: Transfer BTC or ETH to Binance from GDAX
You are going to need to create an account on Binance. You should enable 2-factor authentication using google authenticator for added security.
Go to Funds-> Deposits Withdrawals
Select the currency you want to deposit from GDAX, click Deposit, and copy the wallet address. Make sure you pay attention to the note.
Select the currency you want to deposit from GDAX, click Deposit, and copy the wallet address. Make sure you pay attention to the note.
Step 6: Go back to GDAX because that's where your BTC/ETH resides.
Go to BTC or ETH product drop-down (whichever currency you bought in step 4)
Click Withdraw and go to BTC Address or ETH Address (whatever you see based on your currency).
Enter your amounts and two-factor code. Your money is successfully transferred to Binance.
Step 7: Now you can buy IOTA, Ripple, NEO, etc from Binance
Go back to Binance, and verify your BTC or ETH should be available under Funds-> Deposits Withdrawals (you can also use a service like Changelly for this).
Tip: Click ‘Hide 0 balance' to filter quickly.
Go to Exchange -> Basic at top
Search for your Altcoin currency (e.g. IOTA, NEO, XRP etc.) in the rightmost panel.
Make sure you select Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) at the top.
Click on the pair name. (e.g. IOTA/BTC – First currency is the one you are buying, and second is the one you are trading in exchange for)
Finally, buy your Altcoin in the middle of the page. Enter your Price and Amount for the limit order, and click buy IOTA (or any
Altcoins)
Your order will show up in the Open Orders window at the bottom until they are fulfilled.
Once fulfilled, you can see them in ‘My 24h Order History' or under ‘Funds'->'Deposits & Withdrawals' tab.
There you have it. If anyone has any questions, feel free to leave a comment below. Chances are, you will not be the only one with the question. Thanks for reading. Please share if this has helped you!

He's the man responsible for masterminding the biggest shock in Rugby World Cup history...Eddie Jones' place in the folklore of the game in Japan is secure after their 34-32 beating of South Africa on the opening weekend of the tournament.
Now Jones has delivered a blueprint for how to beat the Springboks as Wales prepare to face Heyneke Meyer's side in the quarter-final at Twickenham on Saturday.
In an article for the Daily Mail, the former Australia coach came up with an eight-point plan they believe Warren Gatland's men should follow at Headquarters....

Read more: Wales v South Africa head-to-heads: How Rugby World Cup heavyweights measure up ahead of quarter-final clash
1. Keep the ball in play
Wales must trust they are fitter than South Africa and keep the ball on the park as much as possible...which means kicking in-field rather than to touch.
Jones said: “Despite their terrible luck with injuries, Wales pride themselves on their fitness.
“South Africa are a big, physical side with some old heads so Wales have to try and keep the ball in play for more than 40 minutes of the game.”
Read more: Gwyn Jones' Wales v South Africa verdict: I expect a brutal, ferocious kicking contest... and Warren Gatland's men to pinch it
2. Mind games
Warren Gatland's ability to get into the minds of their players could count for a lot, says Jones.
They said: “Warren Gatland's psychological nous is excellent, probably the best of all the coaches at the World Cup.
“He has this ability to bring players into the team who haven't been playing and yet they play above themselves.
“Wales' record against South Africa is poor but I'm sure he'll be telling their boys this has nothing to do with history. This is a one-off game and Wales have got absolutely nothing to lose.”

3. Speed

The secret of Japan's success against the Boks, says Jones, was playing at as quick a pace as possible.
Jones said: “Wales have to get quick and clean set-piece ball and then focus on getting over the gain line as quickly as possible.
“That's exactly what we did with Japan to keep the Springboks on the back foot.
“We tried to play with real speed because then you can take away their rush defence, their big hits and put them under pressure.”
4. Carry on Faletau

Jones said: “Taulupe Faletau has been the best No 8 in the competition so far.  They are such a big ball carrier for Wales and they have to get them in the game.
“Duane Vermeulen has been a bit quiet at the World Cup, but at the end of the last game against the USA they were starting to find a bit of form.
“He's a crucial runner for South Africa and is a real threat over the ball at the breakdown as well. That is going to be one of the key head-to-heads in the game.”
5. Target Pollard
(Image: Getty Images)
Jamie Roberts should be sent battering into young Bok outside-half Handre Pollard, according to Jones.
“Pollard's a brave guy but he's not a dominant tackler,” Jones observed.
“So if Wales send in Roberts they can gain line momentum relatively easily, but Wales have to go with pace and precision to succeed.”
6. Get to Fourie du Preez
The iconic Springbok scrum-half has to be unsettled, says Jones.
They said: “From scrum-half they run all their tactics, they get their forwards on the front foot and he's got a superb kicking game.
“And you watch how many times they will take the high ball in defence, they almost plays like a second full-back.
“He lacks that lightning acceleration they had when I was working with them in 2007 but he's an extremely experienced, smart player and Wales have to hassle them as much as possible.”

7. Stay with them on the scoreboard
Jones believes the Boks will be mentally vulnerable because of recent losses to their Japan side and to Argentina in the summer's Rugby Championship.
“If you can stick with them for 60 or 70 minutes and still be close then they get rattled.
“That's when they start to feel the pressure of the scoreboard and the pressure of the clock and they do not play as they would like.
“That's exactly what we played on when we beat them.”
8. Take care of Bismarck

The giant South African hooker is an imposing presence but they can be unsettled, says Jones.
“Wales have to work them hard at every scrum and at the line-out they've got to put them under as much pressure as possible. “Without Victor Matfield they haven't got that go-to line-out guy so Alun Wyn Jones has to compete to try and crank up the pressure on Du Plessis.
“The other thing is to niggle them early on in the match. If Wales can get in there physically, that can put them off their game.”
A division of the Department of Veterans Affairs tasked with fixing up the VA's broken veteran suicide hotline has dropped roughly 1.4 million phone calls from veterans since fiscal year 2015, a VA whistleblower told the Washington Examiner.
That high number of abandoned calls is raising questions about whether the VA is doing all it can to fix up the suicide hotline, which has been criticized as the latest part of the VA that is failing veterans.
Scott Davis, a whistleblower and program specialist at the VA's Health Eligibility Center in Atlanta, noted that the VA's Health Resource Center is slated to take over the VA's suicide hotline. But according to data provided by Davis, the Health Resource Center is dropping hundreds of thousands of calls from veterans each year.
According to internal data provided by Davis, the center was on pace to abandon about 900,000 veterans' calls in 2015. Their data spanned the last 11 months of fiscal year 2015, and showed that 824,000 calls were unanswered or dropped.
The center was abandoning about 15 percent of all calls it received that year. Calls to the Health Resource Center deal with a range of issues faced by veterans, such as questions about eligibility and benefits.
Davis' data also show that in fiscal 2016 so far, the center has dropped more than 500,000 calls, for a total of roughly 1.4 million calls in the last 18 months.
The leader of the Health Resource Center is Matthew Eitutis, a former Air Force officer. He's been in charge of the Health Resource Center for the last two years.
USA Today reported last week that about one in five calls have been dropped by the center. The abandoned call rate was 15.6 percent in 2015, and 19.9 percent in 2016 so far.
I don't mean one of your stray locks that fell into the butter. What I want to know is whether amino acids produced from human hair were used to process the flour that went to make that piece of toast you wolfed down on the way to the bus stop.
It sounds unthinkable doesn't it? But when I became a temporarily became a vegan for Newsnight, I developed a keen interest in what goes into the food I eat and I discovered that a food additive which is sometimes produced from human hair can be used as an additive in some baked goods.
But first, the veganism. I did not do it out of high principle. The idea was to test the claim made by a number of people who e-mailed in to insist that becoming a vegan significantly reduces one's impact on the environment.
I was vegan for one month- January 2007. So this did not preclude me eating Ned the Newsnight turkey for Christmas 2006.
I am happy to report that Ned was as tasty as they were ethical. My family gnawed our way through their ample carcass over the course of a full week. We ate Ned roast on the big day, then sandwiched, curried, as a supreme and finally in a tasty soup. Then, as the last few slices of Ned grew an extravagant mould in the bottom of our fridge, the New Year turned and my diet became completely meat and dairy free.
It wasn't easy. I did not just cut meat and fish out of my diet. Vegans don't eat any animal products including milk, eggs and honey. So did cutting out all animal products reduce my carbon footprint?
I need a bit of persuading about the bees but cows certainly produce an impressive quantity of greenhouse gases - some 500 litres of methane a day per animal.
When my vegan experiment was just getting under way, the then environment minister David Miliband pointed out at a conference that "the livestock sector generates more greenhouse gas emissions than transport". Agriculture is reckoned to account for 7% of all greenhouse gas emissions, about the same as aviation.
And methane isn't the only issue. It is claimed that one acre of arable crops can produce enough food for up to 20 people. Turn that field over to beef production and it will feed just one person.
Not only that, raising animals is a lot more carbon intensive than growing vegetables. David Pimentel, an ecologist from Cornell University, has calculated that animal protein production requires more than eight times as much fossil-fuel energy than plant protein yet yields proteins only 1.4 times as nutritious for humans.
That's the average. When you look at individual sectors the figures are even more startling. Take beef, for example. Using US Department of Agriculture figures they found that beef production requires an energy input to protein output of 54:1 (as well as 100,000 litres of water per kilogram of meat).
Vegetarians shouldn't feel too smug, though. Milk protein has a ratio of 17:1. In fact, rather depressingly the most efficient form of animal production - perhaps not surprisingly - is battery chickens. Pimentel finds that broiler chickens have a ratio of energy input to protein output of just 4:1.
My problem has been eradicating all these inefficient animal proteins from my diet. Take my very first day of vegan living, New Year's Day.
I hadn't prepared very well and hadn't got any margarine in. The local corner shop, a Londis, was open and they stock a good range so I wasn't too worried. But as I worked my way through the eight or so different varieties of margarine I was amazed to find that every single one contained milk or dairy products in some form.
It makes you realise just how common the use of animal products in food is. Before I became a vegan I would eat animal products in every single meal. Indeed the Vegan Society points out that some vegans consider tap water unacceptable because it contains chemicals that have been tested on animals.
I am not going that far but I have certainly developed a mania for reading food labels and there are all sorts of unexpected animal additives.
Most people know that gelatine is produced from animal skin and bones and that the rennet used in some cheeses comes from calves' stomachs. But did you know that bone char (from cow bones) is still occasionally used to whiten some sugars or that some wines and many beers (particularly real ales) include isinglass - a substance obtained from the swim bladders of fish?
Which brings me back to the possibility that human hair may be used in bread. A vegetarian friend alerted me to the existence of an animal-based flour additive called L-Cysteine. It is an amino acid which is used as a flour improver. It is known as E920 and is permitted for use in all biscuits, breads and cakes except those that claim to be wholemeal.
The problem for a would-be vegan is that traditionally L-Cysteine is produced from feathers, pig bristles and sometimes even human hair. These days L-Cysteine can also be produced synthetically but apparently human hair remains one of the richest sources of this amino acid - it makes up about 14% of your hair - and there is a small industry in China making the additive from hair clippings.
There's even a paper on the web written by a Rabbi about whether L-Cysteine from human hair is kosher. Apparently it is - so long as the hair in question was not harvested from dead bodies.
So how commonly is L-Cysteine used? My vegetarian friend claims that the problem with E920 is that - even when it is used - it doesn't have to be listed in the ingredients. They say that's because it is broken down in the baking process so the manufacturers argue that doesn't constitute an ingredient.
That is something the Food Standards Agency flatly denies. It says that L-Cysteine must always be labelled. Indeed, the industry says the reason you so rarely see E920 on labels is that these days it is very rarely used (apparently it was much more common fifteen years ago). The industry also says that the only L-Cysteine their members would use is the synthetic variety.
That is a little odd because according to the Food Standards Agency the European regulation specifies that only L-Cysteine produced from duck and chicken feathers or from pig bristles can be used. That means that, so long as your daily bread was baked in Europe, it almost certainly does not include human hair.
But it's a little confusing. If British bakers are using synthetic L-Cysteine are they breaking EU guidelines? It is hard to get a straight answer. Biscuit makers told me it would be added when the flour is milled - and the millers say it's something the bakers would add.
So if anyone can put this hairy issue to bed once and for all I'd be very grateful. And while I am on the subject, if anyone knows of any other animal-based (or human-based) food ingredients a vegan needs to steer clear of, please do tell me.
NB - Look familiar? This blog is made from 100% recycled material from Justin's 2007 Ethical Man series - keeping it ethical.
Yes, I actually read this stuff all the time:
“In 2005, after Hurricane Katrina, Kanye West appeared on live TV during a celebrity fund-raiser for victims of the disaster and said, “George Bush doesn't care about black people.” This wasn't based on intimate knowledge of Mr. Bush's racial views, but rather on their treatment of black people in a time of crisis. … From the start of their 2016 presidential campaign, Bernie Sanders was prickly about race, uncomfortable with an outspoken, demanding blackness, resistant to letting go of their preference for discussing class over race. They made efforts to improve the way they spoke about the realities of racial discrimination. But Mr. Sanders seemed to remain at heart a man of the people, especially if those people were the white working class. Since the election, Mr. Sanders has sounded an increasingly familiar theme among liberals that they should “go beyond identity politics.” They warned that “to think of diversity purely in racial and gender terms is not sufficient,” and that we need candidates “to be fighters for the working class and stand up to the corporate powers who have so much power over our economic lives.” …” Now we hear again the cry that the neglected white working class is the future of American progressive politics. The tragedy is that much of the professed concern about the white working class is a cover for the interests of white elites who evoke working-class solidarity to combat racial, sexual and gender progress. … Identity has always been at the heart of American culture. We must confront a truth that we have assiduously avoided: The most protected, cherished and nurtured identity of all has been white identity. After all, the needs of the black and brown working classes, which are not exclusively urban, are, again, even in progressive quarters, all but forgotten. Mr. Trump, and to a degree, the liberals and progressives who advocate a vision of America that spurns identity politics, make one thing clear: The real unifying force in American political life is whiteness, no matter its party, gender, region or, at times, even its class.”
Jamelle Bouie also compared President Trump to Dylann Roof last week. They said they were “Brothers in White Resentment.” You know, I would be condemned as a “racist” though for comparing Bouie and Dyson and their narrative of black resentment to Christopher Dorner, Vester Lee Flanagan II (aka Bryce Williams), Ismaaiyl Brinsley, Micah X. and Cosmo Setepenra.
Decades ago, you could have said that White identity was protected, cherished and nurtured in the Jim Crow South. Now, even Trump is afraid to give a shout out to the White community. Black identity is celebrated as a positive good in The New York Times. White identity is excoriated. Dyson's ideal world (he's working on an upcoming book called “Tears We Cannot Stop: A Sermon to White America“) is one in which black chauvinism and identity politics continues to be celebrated and encouraged while White masochism is taught to our youth and White identity politics is proscribed as beyond the pale of respectability. Funny how that works out to the advantage of their own racial group.
Here's an excerpt from the upcoming book:
“Whether they wish to be or not, Donald Trump is the epitome, not only of white innocence and white privilege, but of white power, white rage, and yes, even of white supremacy. … Donald Trump harms our nation's positive racial future. Yet, beloved, there remains, after all, the blackness that is prophecy, the blackness that is inexplicable hope in the face of savage hopelessness.”
How long can the “civil rights” con realistically continue though? This is not someone who is motivated by “colorblindness.” White America was sold on one vision by Martin Luther King, Jr. during the Civil Rights Movement. Dyson, Coates and Bouie are substituting an entirely different one. There has been a bait-and-switch.
More Whites are wising up to the scam in each new election cycle. They are starting to realize that colorblindness is unilateral disarmament. How is it that Michael Eric Dyson is a celebrated intellectual, but someone like Jared Taylor is a fringe extremist? If racial activism is good for blacks, why is it evil for Whites? Sure, what Dylann Roof did in Charleston was bad, but was Micah X.'s actions in Dallas any better?
Identity for me, but not for thee is unsustainable in the long run. It is becoming a political albatross for Democrats.
Editor's note: After reviewing the case, the Hillsborough State Attorney's Office opted not to pursue the felony bribery charge against Michael Schaedel. Records show Schaedel subsequently pleaded no contest in August 2017 to five misdemeanor charges: driving under the influence; refusal to submit to testing; resisting an officer without violence; possession of less than 20 grams of cannabis; and possession of drug paraphernalia.
TAMPA — The officer, it seemed, had made up their mind. Michael Schaedel was going to jail.
Arrested about midnight Wednesday on suspicion of driving under the influence and marijuana possession, all that was left for Schaedel was a patrol car ride to central booking.
But Schaedel made a list-ditch effort to buy their freedom, according to an arrest report: They offered Officer Douglass Bailey $10,000 to let them go.
The two crossed paths just before midnight, when Bailey spotted Schaedel driving erratically in a black 2016 Acura sedan. He'd blocked a crosswalk at a traffic light, spun their tires pulling away from the intersection and was clocked driving over the speed limit, according to the report.
Bailey stopped Schaedel on Green Street near N Howard Avenue and noticed several signs of impairment and a strong odor of alcohol on their breath. Schaedel fumbled clumsily while looking for their driver's license, swayed as they stood and had "a belligerent and uncooperative demeanor," Bailey wrote. Schaedel failed the horizontal gaze test, then refused to complete field sobriety exercises.
A search of the Acura turned up a small glass jar containing about 2 grams of fresh marijuana, a multicolored pipe with burnt residue and vaporizer containing a brown liquid. All three tested positive for THC, a chemical compound in marijuana.
At that point, Schaedel was facing five misdemeanors and a third-degree felony for the alleged possession of THC oil. That's when they made their pitch, according to the report.
Sitting in the back of Bailey's patrol car, "Schaedel pleaded with the affiant to let them go," Bailey wrote. When Bailey refused, they wrote, "the defendant attempted to bribe the affiant by offering to pay $10,000 in exchange for their release."
Bailey didn't bite. They drove Schaedel to the Orient Road Jail for breath testing, where Schaedel tried to keep Bailey from escorting them into the building by pushing and pulling away. Bailey had to bend Schaedel's wrist and pull their arm behind their back to get them inside.
The offer added a second-degree felony to Schaedel's booking sheet: bribery of a public servant, according to the report.
Schaedel, who lives in Oldsmar and works as a financial planner, was released Thursday after posting $12,000 bail, jail records show. They could not immediately be reached for comment.

Six professionals working in Japan will soon be able to add "ninja" to their resumes. As reported by the BBC, the nation's Aichi Prefecture will be hiring six full-time ninjas in an effort to promote "warlord tourism" in the region.
According to the job description, the ninjas will be paid 180,000 yen ($1600) a month to perform on stage and make occasional radio and TV appearances. Required skills include the ability to do "backward handsprings" as well as "some dance moves," according to JapanToday. One poster from the prefecture says that the ideal candidate should "enjoy being under the spotlight even though they or they are a secretive ninja." Additional training in skills like sword play and the use of shuriken throwing stars will be provided to get the ninjas ready to perform by the end of April.
Japanese nationals aren't the only applicants being considered for the positions. The troupe will be performing a portion of their shows in English as well as Japanese, so any English-speaker who's ever dreamed of becoming a modern-day ninja can also apply.
The centuries-old craft of stealth and espionage is all but extinct in Japan, but popular culture has helped the ninja to become one of the county's most recognizable icons worldwide. Other attractions, like the Ninja Museum in Japan's Mie Prefecture, have been using this part of history to draw in tourists for years.
Men and women over 18 with a passion for history and tourism can apply to be a part of Japan's newest generation of ninjas from now until March 22.

The shape of a baseball bat hasn't changed much in the past 150 years, and the axe is many times older than that. By combining those age-old tools, however, the makers of the Axe Bat believe they can bring something new to the Grand Old Game.
The Axe Bat is more than a Frankenstein-style meshing of an axe handle and a baseball bat barrel. The key lies in the bat's final few inches near the handle. That's where the design gracefully curves from the standard round shape to a asymmetrical oval before tapering to an angled knob at the end.
The results, as reported in a recent study (PDF) by UCLA engineering professor Dr. Vijay Gupta, show that the Axe Bat is more comfortable, delivers more power and speed, and reduces injuries when compared with traditional bats.
A hitter's bottom hand grips the Axe Bat away from the palm and more in the fingers, producing a more stable grip with less tension in the hands. Also, the back side of the handle is flat, so it won't poke a hitter in the palm the way a traditional bat handle does. That protrusion can injure the hamate bone on hard and checked swings. If you've ever gone to the batting cages and come away with a bruise between the middle of your palm and the bottom of your thumb, that's your hamate bone. Fractures there have sent dozens of major leaguers, including Ryan Zimmerman, Gordon Beckham, and Pablo Sandoval (twice – once on each hand), to the disabled list.
An asymmetrical handle also means that the bat doesn't rotate in the hitter's hands, so the same face of the bat hits the ball every time. The company calls that "one-sided" hitting. Its latest composite bat, the Avenge L140B, has special construction that allows the hitting side to flex like a spring.

New York woodworker Bruce Leinert got the idea for the Axe Bat in 1990 while chopping wood. To help pass the time, the lifelong baseball fan pretended they were swinging a bat as they swung at trees. The natural fit in their hands and the resulting accurate swings had them convinced they had come upon baseball's next big innovation.
Their idea had some support from one of the game's greatest hitters. In their 1971 book The Science of Hitting, Ted Williams said that a hitter's wrists, at the point of contact, should be "square and unbroken ... just as when you hit a tree with an ax."
Leinert built their first bat in two hours, but it took much longer for their idea to get widespread attention. They filed a patent application in 2007, and two years later, they signed a 20-year licensing deal with Baden Sports, a family-owned sporting goods company based in Washington.
The company's research and development team has spent the last few years refining the design, including a months-long ergonomic study. They were able to speed up the testing phase by 3D-printing prototype bats and then making changes based on feedback from hitters.
"I do believe there will be some point in the future when every bat looks like this," said Hugh Tompkins, who heads R&D for Axe Bat. "This is the first handle that really actually is designed for the way that a hand fits the bat and the mechanics that a hitter goes through when they swing."
Sales have more than tripled since 2012 when the full lineup was first introduced. A majority of those sales have been to youth, high school, and college baseball teams and players, although a few major leaguers, most notably Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Jimmy Rollins, have experimented with a wood model.
Josh Valcarcel/WIRED
Marietta College won the 2012 NCAA Division III national baseball championship in its first season swinging the Axe Bat. The team led the nation in hits (636) and batted .331 as a team. San Jose State, one of two Division I teams that use the Axe Bat exclusively, starting using it in 2013 and had more hits and fewer strikeouts than any team in the Western Athletic Conference that year. And this spring, Memphis Tigers outfielder Chris Carrier used an Axe Bat in winning the American Athletic Conference Home Run Derby.
“My hitting coach, Clay Greene, likes it because they think our bat stays in the zone a little bit longer,” said Memphis head coach Daron Schoenrock, whose team led the league in hitting in 2013. "Our guys like it so much that they're swinging the wood Axe Bat in summer ball."
While the Axe Bat isn't threatening the big players like Louisville Slugger and Easton for market dominance just yet, it's already secured a coveted spot in a baseball shrine. Inside a reproduction of a Seattle Mariners' locker in the "Today's Game" exhibit at the Baseball Hall of Fame sits an Axe Bat. The company is hoping others will one day join it there in Cooperstown.
Searching through the currently active listings in the Vancouver area today (as of this writing), I was able to find 11 homes on the market that are currently tenanted. Here is a list of those 11 properties, including the current asking prices, rents, taxes and condo fees (if any). I've also calculated the cap rates.
For comparison, I also looked through listings in the Seattle area and was able to find 11 homes there. Why Seattle? It's probably the most comparable city to Vancouver: both coastal, with similar populations, climates, culture, lifestyle, natural beauty and incomes.
Cap Rates
Capitalization rate (or cap rate) is used to estimate an investor's potential return on their or their investment. The cap rate of a property is its net income divided by its value. For these examples, I've taken the annual rent and subtracted property taxes and condo fees to determine net income. I then divided this income by the current asking price.
In Vancouver, the average cap rate is a dismal 2.32 per cent, and not a single property generated returns higher than any of the 11 Seattle properties. Seattle cap rates averaged over two and a half times higher, at 6.11 per cent.
Considering you can buy a Real Estate Investment Trust ETF which currently yields 5 per cent, why would anyone settle for 2.32 per cent? At least in Seattle, you can be somewhat compensated for the extra hassle of being a landlord.
Price-to-rent ratios
When making a decision to buy or rent, a common metric investors consider is the price-to-rent ratio. To calculate the ratio, divide the price of the property by its annual rent. From an investment point of view, the lower the ratio the better. When the ratio gets too high, renting is usually a better option. Here are some commonly used price-to-rent guidelines from Trulia.
Price-to-rent ratio of 15 or less: Buying a home is a better deal than renting for a planning to live in a home for at least five years. However, if the plan is for less than five years, buying could be a better deal, if the index is 10 or less and depending on moving and closing costs.
Buying a home is a better deal than renting for a planning to live in a home for at least five years. However, if the plan is for less than five years, buying could be a better deal, if the index is 10 or less and depending on moving and closing costs. Price-to-rent ratio of 15 to 20: Renting or buying a home could be a better deal, depending on the prospective buyer's personal situation.
Renting or buying a home could be a better deal, depending on the prospective buyer's personal situation. Price-to-rent ratio of 20 or more: Renting is a better deal than buying a home, except for people planning to live in a home a very long time (15 years or more).
The average price-to-rent ratio in Seattle it is 14.5. According to Trulia's guidelines, buying is probably the better option for anyone planning to keep the home more than a few years.
However, in Vancouver the ratio is a staggering 36.9. Considering that Trulia recommends renting anytime the ratio is above 20, most rational investors wouldn't even consider buying here.
Is Vancouver in a bubble?
When looking at these fundamental metrics, anyone buying a home in Vancouver today must be counting on continued, significant appreciation. But with valuations already at unreasonably high levels, why would anyone expect them to continue going up?
While there doesn't appear to be a standard, universally accepted definition of a bubble, here is a pretty good one from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.
Economists use the term “bubble” to describe an asset price that has risen above the level justified by economic fundamentals, as measured by the discounted stream of expected future cash flows that will accrue to the owner of the asset. The dramatic rise in U.S. stock prices during the late 1990s, followed similarly by U.S. house prices during the early 2000s, are episodes that have both been described as “bubbles.”
While the causes of the current situation are debatable, there is no doubt that prices in Vancouver are well "above the level justified by fundamentals"."
Using the definition above, the Vancouver real estate market is clearly in a bubble.

As LRO orbits the Moon every two hours sending down a stream of science data, it is easy to forget how close the Moon is to the Earth. The average distance between the two heavenly bodies is just 384,399 km (238,854 miles). Check your airline frequent flyer totals, perhaps you have already flown the distance to the Moon and back on a single airline!
LROC's most recent Earth calibration sequence captured a magnificent view of the Americas with only minimal cloud cover. Contrast the current image with the NAC view taken last June, which revealed much of central Asia.
The Moon is a spectacular sight in the nighttime sky. Now imagine the Earth from the Moon, four times larger, a delicate blue, and it does not rise nor set. To astronauts, the Earth is a constant companion, at least on the nearside. Of course, on the farside you can never see the Earth.
The overarching goal of the LRO mission is to obtain the data needed to enable engineers and scientists to design the hardware and instruments to pick up lunar exploration where it was paused in December of 1972, after Apollo 17. LRO has now collected these data, so we are ready to move along the path of returning to the Moon! Will designs for lunar habitats include Earth windows? Certainly a human factor to consider! Are there any adverse psychological effects for future lunar explorers on the farside with no Earth overhead? What do you think? For now, we are happy to occasionally snap an image of the Earth as the NAC collects routine calibration data.

The Growing Public Pension and Muni Bond Bubble
A credit bubble is created when the amount of money borrowed exceeds the capacity of the borrower to pay it back. This concept is easy to understand, but the financial foundation of borrowing has been manipulated to an historic extreme by government. Not just through the national debt but through the agreements to create debt through public sector union contracts and municipal bond issuance. The scale of the public pension and muni bond bubble has not been widely reported. There are 90,000 units of government in the U.S. A large number of these have public pension plans. In 2014 there were 19.5 million people enrolled in public pension plans and 9.6 million receiving pensions. In California alone there were 3.36 million people receiving public pensions. Since there were 23 million people in California age 21 and over this means that over one in seven California adults is currently receiving a public pension.
What 'Mastered For iTunes' Really Means
You could say that the story of the recording industry over the last decade and a half — the era since the MP3 rattled its game plan — has been a struggle to find a balance between the consumer's demand for widespread access to music, the artist's desire for high-quality product and the industry's need for compensation.
Last month, Apple made a move that subtly shifts this balance when they began selling albums in a new section of the iTunes store called "Mastered for iTunes."
Enlarge this image Apple Apple
Apple introduced the news quietly, and it was received mostly as a behind-the-scenes tech development — I noticed a long piece about the development in Ars Technica before I saw the banner ad in the iTunes store — but it says a lot, I think, about the company's understanding of what listeners want from their digital audio files.
Over and over, technology has changed both the way we record sound and the way we listen to it. New formats are greeted with fanfare, but often, in the first years after supposed advancements, recordings suffer as technicians adapt old techniques. Early CDs were just digital versions of recordings mastered for vinyl, and sounded terrible. Recording engineers adapted, which triggered a craze for remastering (and repackaging, and re-purchasing) those albums for the new format. But MP3s have always been seen by the industry — and many consumers — as a transitional product of compromised quality.
Users accepted that compromise because of the huge gains in convenience — no more carrying around booklets of CDs or waiting weeks for your local record store to restock a physical format. Among many, the hope, for the duration of the MP3 era, has been that quality would steadily improve in tandem with bandwidth and storage capabilities, so that eventually the quality of downloadable digital files would equal or surpass that of files burned onto little plastic discs. For a decade, we were on a road to a musical utopia: great-sounding audio files that we could send from one place to another with ease.
The basic goal of the "Mastered for iTunes" store essentially cuts that ideal off at the knees, or at least points to the fact that we may have already been off that road for some time.
I'll get to that in a minute. First, a few necessary words about mastering:
The music you listen to, no matter what the format, sounds worse than it does in the studio where it was recorded. That's not just because musicians and recording engineers have better equipment than you do, but because the recordings themselves contain more information. Today, most studio tracks are recorded at 24 bits. The process of mastering a recording is taking the raw, mixed song and copying it to another format, with adjustments in the amount of information that can be transferred to the new medium and attendant tweaks to ensure it sounds as good as possible given the new format's limitations. The music on standard commercial CDs is encoded at 16 bits.
Even so, the slightly compressed digital files on CDs are called "lossless" files because you can still take the quality down another step and have something most people enjoy listening to. When you rip a song from a CD into iTunes as a "lossy" file like an MP3 (or AAC, Apple's preferred format), you're using a compression codec, a program designed to eliminate the parts of the sound in a song that you don't notice or can't hear.
The triumph of MP3 and AAC formats is that they remove an enormous amount of the information contained within a recording without making it sound like they're removing an enormous amount of information. When we listen to a digital file (especially on a better sound system), we might be able to tell that something is missing, but that something might be so peripheral to what we think of as enjoyable about music that we're willing to trade the slight downgrade in quality for the huge step up in convenience.
Today, convenience is winning the war. Since reaching its peak in 2001, sales of CDs have declined by nearly 69 percent, according to statistics from Nielsen SoundScan, while digital album sales continue to rise. In its guide to mastering for iTunes, Apple says, "Digital distribution is no longer an afterthought. It is today's dominant medium for consuming music and as such needs to be treated with utmost care and attention."
If the implication there, that we haven't been treating our portable, compressed audio files with proper care, makes you think that Apple is finally moving toward a hi-def format, you'd be wrong. Instead, the company is asking bands and their labels to submit songs to the store that are encoded as AAC files directly from the original, 24-bit studio recordings.
In Apple's calculation, mastering a song or album "for iTunes" means that it'll sound better while remaining just as portable as the encoded files we're accustomed to packing by the thousands onto our phones and mobile devices. For Bob Ludwig, a mastering engineer who remastered Coldplay's latest album, Mylo Xyloto, for the new "Mastered for iTunes" store, this makes sense. "From a technical viewpoint, there are cases where the lossy 24-bit AAC file would be superior to the lossless CD," Ludwig wrote in an email. "I did an early demonstration for some engineer friends of mine and the difference between the 'Mastered for iTunes' file I created and the one that was ripped from a 16-bit CD was easily heard on the little speakers on my MacBook Pro."
I listened to the two versions of Coldplay's single, "Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall," to test the difference. (I can't post audio samples of the two versions of the track here because the encoding process a file goes through in any audio editor obscures those subtle differences, but if you have a CD version of any of the albums in the "Mastered for iTunes" section of the store, you can compare easily by ripping the tracks at "iTunes Plus" quality.) Played over decent headphones, I could hear subtle differences, especially where the mix was denser and more complicated. Ludwig's "Mastered for iTunes" version sounds slightly less crowded, with clearer distinctions between similar tones in acoustic guitar and piano and sharper, less distorted drums.
That's partly because Apple is providing mastering engineers with software that helps tweak individual songs that will be encoded as AACs, rather than relying on a standardized encoding process — as intelligently designed as it might be — to handle the compression correctly. It's a crucial step, because tracks mastered for AAC aren't technically of higher quality; they're just made to sound as good as possible within the restrictions of the format.
There's an implication there that bugs some people who believe iTunes, which is the single largest music retailer in the world, should do more to push the market toward higher-quality files, where those restrictions don't exist. John Vanderslice, a musician who owns Tiny Telephone, a recording studio in San Francisco where Death Cab For Cutie, Spoon, The Mountain Goats, Kronos Quartet and tUnE-yArDs have all recorded, thinks that asking the industry to make a commitment to highly compressed digital files is misguided.
Vanderslice's studio doesn't do mastering, but as a musician, producer and studio owner, they hear many albums before and after the mastering process. "The idea of mastering is that you have the definitive high resolution product and you wilfully ignore every other variable downstream," they say, "whether it's compression codecs or speakers or whether someone's listening to it on earbuds."
The idea of mastering for a lesser format, Vanderslice says, is "completely insane. My first reaction was it would be like if you were a writer and you were told that you would have to re-edit your book for the dimwitted or the dyslexic."
Here's another technological analogy: pan and scan, the process by which films were cropped from their original widescreen aspect ratios in order to be played on televisions in the 1980s. Annoying for nearly everyone involved, to be sure, but accepted as a reality of the marketplace back when none of us had widescreen TVs hanging on our walls. A skilled editor might have made the decisions about what part of the image was shown on the smaller screen, but the original work was still compromised.
So why would Apple embrace a inherently inferior format (and ask musicians to shell out thousands of dollars to tailor their songs for it)? Because what we're talking about here isn't actually about downloading songs. It's about streaming them.
To me, the only way "Mastered for iTunes" makes sense is as part of a calculation for a future that doesn't look like the one we planned on. If the MP3 opened the door to let convenience into the format conversation, streaming offers another world: every song you've ever heard or thought of available instantly as long as you've got a network connection. We've got cloud-based services coming out our ears: Apple's iCloud, Amazon's Cloud Drive, Google Music, Spotify and Rdio, to name just a few. And here, the size of a file still matters. Our connections may be fast enough to download high-quality, lossless audio files (and HD videos, for that matter), but streaming audio can tax cellular and broadband networks as well as users' data plans.
Streaming also changes our relationship with music itself — in moving toward a model that values nearly unlimited access, we're also approaching a reality in which the idea of owning a recording is a luxury. This is good for Apple, because high-quality audio costs more to store and to transmit to listeners, but also because it gets to dictate the terms under which the idea of "quality" will be determined. For people like Vanderslice, who want studio-quality recordings in their home libraries, this might not actually be a bad thing. If the vast majority of the audience accepts streaming services as good enough, the few who want to buy songs — in physical or digital formats — might be able to demand higher quality for their money.
UPDATE Wednesday, March 7, 2012 @ 1:50 p.m.
As some of you have pointed out in the comments, this post contains incorrect information about the files that mastering engineers are submitting to Apple to be sold in the "Mastered for iTunes" section of the store. I wrote:
"The implication there, that we haven't been treating our portable, compressed audio files with proper care, makes you think that Apple is finally moving toward a hi-def format, you'd be wrong. Instead, the company is asking bands and their labels to submit songs to the store that are encoded as AAC files directly from the original, 24-bit studio recordings."
The last part of this paragraph is incorrect, and the error changes the way I understand what Apple's doing. Apple didn't respond to requests for comment (they're a little busy right now), but I spoke again with Bob Ludwig, the mastering engineer quoted in the story, who has submitted "Mastered for iTunes" tracks to Apple. They say the company is simply providing mastering engineers with tools that allow them to see how songs mastered at 24 bits will clip (that is, distort audibly) when they go through the standardized AAC encoding process. That's been difficult to do in the past. Seeing the places where all lossy encoders create clipping in the music gives engineers a reference for how to adjust the master recordings to avoid that distortion. The uncompressed files are then submitted to iTunes, which creates lossless versions before encoding the songs as 256 kpbs AAC files for sale in the iTunes store. (Through the testing process, Apple has even been submitting its encoded AAC files to mastering engineers to make sure the process hasn't created any unforeseen errors.)
Why is this significant? Because the fact that Apple retains the lossless versions of the high-quality studio masters means that iTunes, at any time it decides to, can begin selling higher-quality encodes, or even lossless files. If this story is, at bottom, about how the demands of consumers shift the balance between convenience and quality, then this new development is Apple's effort to allow humans to correct flaws in a very useful but imperfect technology. It does not mean that the company is locking its users into an inferior format.
I didn't write this post to complain about Apple's continued sale of 256kpbs AAC files (though there are plenty of people who wish the company would offer higher-quality encodes or, even better, a lossless option). What drew me to this story was the fact that it gives us an opportunity to mark a moment where the largest music retailer in the world seems to be making two significant moves: to create tools to make a better end result with any lossy codec while suggesting that lossy formats will likely be a part of our lives for the foreseeable future. Because the way we listen to music is so tied to a rapidly shifting technology, moments like that happen regularly. It's not often, though, that we get to note them in real time.
Document Recovered From The Marianas Trench
I need to write this down, because I forget things sometimes, and I think what I heard today was important. Not to me, the time for me or almost anyone else alive on Earth today to make a difference has passed, but someone, somewhere might be able to make something of this, or at least find it helpful, or something. Once I'm done, I'm going to seal it up in a pipe, coat it in wax, and chuck it into the ravine. Maybe someday someone will read this, and try to put things together. If they're allowed to.
I'd love to start at the beginning, but I'm honestly not sure when the world started to end. Could have been years and years before the final bits, or it could have been all at once. Everything was so grim, what with warmer air, cooler seas, too little gas and too many people, things could have been unraveling for ages before things bubbled up to the public eye. What I and others remember most was when the Disney Magic sank. It was then, I think, that most people started to think that things might be worse than they seemed.
The Disney Magic was a big cruise ship, one of those liner jobs that tools around islands and stuff. One day, the news was all screaming about how it suddenly just went down when it was trying to put in to port. The weird thing about it was how there was no video of it for a long time. Some still pictures of it floating fine, but none of it actually going down. Then, somehow, a tape showed up, and the news started playing it. I have to imagine they didn't review it first.
The ship was puffing along, strong and fast, little boats bobbing around it, looking like every vacation lover's dream, when suddenly it stopped. I mean stopped, just a dead halt like it had just slammed into a mountain. You could see people go lurching forward all over the deck, a bunch of junk fall off the sides, a real mess. It's all still for a few seconds, then suddenly there's this foaming behind the ship. Most people assumed it was the engine trying to fire up again… then the arm came up.
I'm not sure if it actually was an arm, but it was some kind of limb, and it must have been a hundred feet long at least. It reached up along the side of the boat and… just ripped it open, I mean unzipped it like a coat, and you could see all the people inside screaming and running… it was awful. Then you saw something lurch up, a big, spiny shape pushing against that gap, shoving in… then there was an explosion on its back, and the camera whipped up to show a couple of jets whizzing by… then it ended.
I remember just sitting there, stunned, looking at the TV, barely noticing the president coming on to declare a state of emergency. I think it was two or three days later when the TV went under full government control, but it may have been a week, I'm not sure. Internet got clamped later, but soon all you could hear, read or see was “remain calm, everything is under control”. The oddest thing was that life really didn't change much for a while. Bills still came, still had to work, go to school, all that. Just a lot more scared faces, and a lot more weird talk.
Pretty soon we were getting told that whole towns were being evacuated, that there was a plague, or a riot, or a terrorist bomb, or some other nightmare. My brother down south said that they got moved because of a huge wildfire. The weird thing was, they said, that the fire moved oddly… seemed to shoot right for gas or brush, and didn't travel evenly. That after a while, they swore they saw what looked like a twenty foot tall man of fire walking and eating everything. The call got dropped right after they said that. I haven't talked to them since.
So things got worse, little by little. People kept being moved, and there was no real way to communicate with each other anymore that was really reliable, so it was hard to say just how bad things were. Still, word of mouth was still going strong, and it was creepy. Crazy shit, really, stuff about zombies in the north, killing frenzies in the east, a place near the ocean where the ground was alive and eating people, a cult screaming about the second coming and killing people to buy off god… I started pulling more and more away from people, just to get some ignorant peace of mind. Looking back, that probably saved my life.
Finally, one day, I woke up and there was blood on my window. It was outside, and I could hear some insane shit going down outside… screaming, clanking, gunshots, and a smell like burning wires. I hid. I'm not ashamed to admit it, I left my fellow man to rot, and hid inside for almost a full week, long after the noise stopped. After the fifth day, the electricity and gas gave out, along with the running water. When I finally got hard up for supplies, I poked my nose out, and saw that the whole west side of the world was gone.
Now, I don't know for sure if it actually is gone, but there is a cliff that starts thirty feet to the west of my house, and I cannot see the bottom of it. I also can't see the other side of this ravine, so for all intents and purposes, that part of the world is gone for me. The suburb I was in looked like a war zone, blood and broken stuff everywhere, houses carved up… no bodies though, which I still think was weird. I scrounged up some food and stuff from some of the houses, then went back home.
I've been doing that for a while now. I'm not sure how long, really. Might have been years and years, or just a few months, it's hard to say. Sometimes the sun just sticks in one spot for what feels like days… other times these clouds roll in, and you can't see two feet. There's… things around, too. I run at the first noise, but I think they're about man-sized, and they seem to like metal. Other, little things scramble around in the rubble sometimes, so I try and keep clear. One time, a thing that looked like a pill bug the size of a cat crawled out, looked at me, and screamed “STOP!” in perfect English. I hid inside for days.
There are also these big blimp-things that float around sometimes. They have little bug legs on their undersides, and they look kinda like maggots, but with eyes all over. They eat everything when they land, but most of the time they stay high up. One of these had just passed when I found the hurt guy. They were all ripped up, and looked like one of those S.W.A.T. Team guys you see on tv sometimes, but their combat suit thing was all ripped to hell. I dragged them back home, and then we talked.
They said that they had been hunting the blimp-thing, but had gotten attacked. They wouldn't say by what, but they looked like they were on their last legs. I fed them some canned beans and some water, and they seemed to come around a little. Asked me who I was, if I was alright and all that. They seemed kinda shocked when I said they were the first person I'd seen since the west of the world vanished. They told me it wasn't gone, just relocated, but wouldn't say what that meant. I helped heal them up, and kept asking who they are, but they wouldn't say. Finally, they said screw it, that their orders were probably no good any more anyway, and told me.
They said they worked for a foundation or something, and that they were like a combination jail and research center. They said that they were one of the agents who went around trying to find strange stuff and keep it from hurting people. I said they were doing a hell of a job so far, and they laughed pretty hard. They said something had happened, and that a bunch of these things had gotten loose at the same time, and caused this foundation place to lose control. They said it became a “GH-0 'Dead Greenhouse' scenario”.
I asked them what that meant, and they looked at me for awhile before going on. They said that's what they call a situation where everybody on earth dies, but the earth itself is still ok and can support life. I asked what did that matter if everybody's dead, and they smiled strangely. I asked them if anyone else on earth was still alive, and they said yes, but carefully spread out and contained. After that, I just sorta sat and digested things for a bit, and the man started stretching and checking their cuts. They were starting to pull their boots on when I asked what happens now.
They said that they have to “reboot” things. Said they have the technology to recreate almost anything, and that making people is actually pretty easy. Said that they would clean out and contain things, rebuild the broken cities, and repopulate them. It would take a long, long time, but they said they would eventually get things back to the way they were before. Even said they could recreate memories and stuff. I just sat, kinda stunned, and watched them as they just kept going along, getting dressed like this was all no big deal. I told them they were nuts, that there was no way people could just forget, that this could all be just swept away. They stopped, looked at me, smiled, then said “Why not? It's been done before.”
I don't know if that man was crazy or not, but I think they were sane. As they were leaving, they said something about putting my house underwater. Please, don't let them brush me away. Don't let them hide us. Try and find more, I know there's got to be more people who tried to leave something behind. Don't let the world die in vain. Remember us.

When it comes to energy, everyone loves efficiency. Cutting energy waste is one of those goals that both sides of the political divide can agree on, even if they sometimes diverge on how best to get there. Energy efficiency allows us to get more out of our given resources, which is good for the economy and (mostly) good for the environment as well. In an increasingly hot and crowded world, the only sustainable way to live is to get more out of less. Every environmentalist would agree.
But change the conversation to food, and suddenly efficiency doesn't look so good. Conventional industrial agriculture has become incredibly efficient on a simple land to food basis. Thanks to fertilizers, mechanization and irrigation, the American farmer feeds over 155 people worldwide. Conventional farming gets more and more crop per sq. foot of cultivated land—over 170 bushels of corn per acre in Iowa, for example—which can mean less territory needs to be converted from wilderness to farmland. And since a third of the planet is already used for agriculture—destroying forests and other wild habitats along the way—anything that could help us produce more food on less land would seem to be good for the environment.
Of course, that's not how most environmentalists regard their arugula. Greens have embraced organic food as better for the planet—and healthier and tastier, too—than the stuff produced by Big Ag. Environmentalists disdain the enormous amounts of energy needed and waste created by conventional farming, while organic practices—forgoing artificial fertilizers and chemical pesticides–are considered far more sustainable. Sales of organic food rose 7.7% in 2010, up to $26.7 billion—and people are making those purchases for their consciences as much as their taste buds.
Yet a new meta-analysis in Nature does the math and comes to a hard conclusion: organic farming yields 25% fewer crops on average than conventional agriculture. More land therefore needed to produce fewer crops—and that means organic farming may not be as good for the planet as we think.
(MORE: Getting Real About the High Price of Cheap Food)
In the Nature analysis, scientists from McGill University in Montreal and the University of Minnesota performed an analysis of 66 studies comparing conventional and organic methods across 34 different crop species, from fruits to grains to legumes. They found that organic farming delivered a lower yield for every crop type, though the disparity varied widely. For rain-watered legume crops like beans or perennial crops like fruit trees, organic trailed conventional agriculture by just 5%. Yet for major cereal crops like corn or wheat, as well as most vegetables—all of which provide the bulk of the world's calories—conventional agriculture outperformed organics by more than 25%.
The main difference is nitrogen, the chemical key to plant growth. Conventional agriculture makes use of 171 million metric tons of synthetic fertilizer each year, and all that nitrogen enables much faster plant growth than the slower release of nitrogen from the compost or cover corps used in organic farming. When we talk about a Green Revolution, we really mean a nitrogen revolution—along with a lot of water.
But not all the nitrogen used in conventional fertilizer ends in crops—much of it ends up running off the soil and into the oceans, created vast polluted dead zones. As Richard Black of the BBC points out, we're already putting more nitrogen into the soil than the planet can stand over the long term. And conventional agriculture also depends heavily on chemical pesticides, which can have unintended side effects—see the allegations that the pesticide imidacloprid may be connected to honeybee colony collapse disorder.
(MORE: Caged Hens: An Undercover Investigation Reveals Apparent Animal Cruelty at an Egg Farm)
What that means is that while conventional agriculture is more efficient—sometimes much more efficient—than organic farming, there are trade-offs with each. So an ideal global agriculture system, in the views of the study's authors, may borrow the best from both systems, as Jonathan Foley of the University of Minnesota told Andrew Revkin:
The bottom line? Today's organic farming practices are probably best deployed in fruit and vegetable farms, where growing nutrition (not just bulk calories) is the primary goal. But for delivering sheer calories, especially in our staple crops of wheat, rice, maize, soybeans and so on, conventional farms have the advantage right now. Looking forward, I think we will need to deploy different kinds of practices (especially new, mixed approaches that take the best of organic and conventional farming systems) where they are best suited — geographically, economically, socially, etc.
So that could mean conventional agriculture may be the rule for grains and some vegetables, while fruits and other crops could benefit from going organic. Ultimately, though, we'll need to improve global farming—and fast, with another 2 billion people set to join the Earth by 2050. That could mean using genetically modified crops that require less nitrogen and less water, or that produce a higher yield, even as farmers learn to use both water and fertilizer much more efficiently. And lastly, we need to do a much, much better job of distributing the food we do produce. As David Biello points out in Scientific American, farmers produce more than 3,000 calories for every person on the planet every day—enough to ensure that no one goes to bed hungry. Yet more than 1 billion people are hungry, even as we waste as much as one-third of the food produced around the world. Maybe reducing that waste is where we should start. After all—as greens have long known about energy—the cheapest and most sustainable calorie is the one you don't have to produce.

Concerned that time is running out to land a Major League Soccer franchise for the Twin Cities, St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman said Thursday that they will lead an “all-hands-on-deck effort” in coming weeks to build a stadium in their city.
The mayor gave no specifics on a financing plan, saying that it was too early to say how St. Paul might assist local investors in building a $120 million soccer-only stadium on an underdeveloped tract in the Midway area.
But now that Minneapolis has missed the MLS deadline for a plan to build a stadium near Target Field, Coleman said, the 34.5-acre site at Snelling and University avenues represents Minnesota's best chance to get a franchise that was promised on the condition that it has its own field.
“I'm a firm believer that MLS will do well in Minnesota, but I also believe that the clock is ticking right now for a soccer-specific stadium,” Coleman said in a conference call with reporters.
Several times the mayor stressed the need to act quickly, before MLS offers the franchise to another city. Yet their silence as the July 1 deadline passed for Minneapolis raised speculation that soccer officials were only using St. Paul to leverage a better deal for Minneapolis.
Minneapolis isn't giving up, City Council Member Jacob Frey said Thursday. The city's stadium working group, formed last month, has scheduled its first meeting for July 17; it includes Mayor Betsy Hodges, several council members and top city staffers.
“I've talked with the team. They're not messing around,” Frey said, declining to elaborate.
Coleman asserted that they negotiate “with my eyes wide open” and has no intention of being a pawn in a game being played for Minneapolis' benefit.
“I'm confident that we can get something done,” they said.
On Wednesday Coleman invited MLS President and Deputy Commissioner Mark Abbott to tour the Midway site, which includes an aging strip mall and vacant acreage once used by Metro Transit to store buses.
MLS spokesperson Dan Courtemanche confirmed Thursday that Abbott spoke late Wednesday with Coleman, but did not provide further details.
“We look forward to visiting St. Paul soon,” Courtemanche said. “A date has not been set yet.” Coleman said that a visit might have to wait until after the MLS All-Star Game later this month.
“It's very clear that they need a real plan as opposed to a hope,” Coleman said. “We won't have all the details ironed out in the next two to three weeks, but we think we can show them that the site will work.”
The mayor has had two informal meetings with the local ownership group led by Dr. Bill McGuire, who owns the Minnesota United FC franchise, but no specific deal has been discussed. Neither team officials nor McGuire would comment Thursday.
The investors — who include members of the Pohlad family, which owns the Twins, and Glen Taylor, owner of the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Star Tribune — pledged to use their own money to build a soccer-only stadium in downtown Minneapolis. But they sought property and sales tax breaks that they said would make the project profitable, and MLS held the group to a July 1 deadline to finalize a stadium plan.
The Legislature balked and Minneapolis officials didn't act. So last week Abbott — who grew up in Oakdale, an east metro suburb — announced that MLS, while not ruling out Minneapolis entirely, would be looking at St. Paul.
Coleman said he'd be willing to consider the kind of tax relief that the investors sought from Minneapolis. A stadium would generate enough redevelopment nearby to more than offset whatever tax breaks are offered, they said.
The Midway site promoted by Coleman is one of two in St. Paul that's been discussed as having soccer potential; the other one, west of the State Capitol, is home to a Sears department store.
Most of the Midway site is owned by a New York-based property management firm that Coleman said has expressed interest in redeveloping the shopping center. The remaining third, the former bus barn site held by Metro Transit, might easily be offered tax free since it's already been tax-exempt for decades, the mayor said.
‘An ideal location'
City Council Member Dai Thao, who represents the stadium site area, said the council is willing to consider using “all the tools the city can leverage.”
“I don't know how serious [the ownership group is] … but I think it would be a good fit,” they said. “It's an ideal location.”
City Council Member Amy Brendmoen said they wanted more details. “We are challenged in St. Paul with so many parcels off the tax rolls to begin with, so it has to be a smart plan and prudent and respectful of the burden on taxpayers,” they said.
The Midway site — at the intersection of the Green Line and the future bus rapid transit “A” Line on Snelling Avenue, and right off Interstate 94 — has the backing of the St. Paul Area Chamber of Commerce, which quickly expressed support for Coleman's stadium push.
The stadium “would have a … catalytic effect in jump-starting property values, increased neighborhood vitality and increased economic employment opportunities,” Chamber President Matt Kramer said in a statement.
Not everyone is convinced. Tom Goldstein, a lawyer and former school board member who is running for the City Council, said a stadium would roil plans to redevelop the site with new streets and job-producing businesses. They said they suspected that the owners would seek not just tax breaks but road improvements, parking and development rights.
“It won't work and defeats efforts to make it a transit-oriented hub,” they said.
Coleman, who has been careful not to appear to interfere with Minneapolis' efforts to land soccer, reiterated Thursday that St. Paul is launching a stadium campaign now only because the conversation looks to have ended in Minneapolis. They said they had talked with Hodges but that “no one has greenlighted this from that side of the river.”
Frey denied that Coleman's interest had spurred Minneapolis into action.
“Obviously, I'm biased in favor of Minneapolis,” they said. “I think Minneapolis has all the tools to make this a tremendously successful cultural infrastructure investment. My first choice is Minneapolis and my second choice is St. Paul, but I certainly don't want to squander the opportunity for the region.”

The late Anthony Minghella was one of Britain's most admired film-makers, winning nine Oscars for The English Patient, the war drama they wrote and directed, inspired by Michael Ondaatje's novel. A decade after their death, their son is following in their footsteps as a writer and director, working with the producer of La La Land, the musical that won six Oscars this year.
Actor Max Minghella is making their directorial debut with a British feature film set on the Isle of Wight, where their father's family ran an ice-cream business. The new film, Teen Spirit, is a coming-of-age drama about a shy girl who has dreams of becoming a pop star and enters an international music competition.
Minghella wrote it with their friend Jamie Bell, the actor who won a Bafta for Billy Elliot, the story of a miner's son who takes up ballet.
Bell is also an executive producer of Teen Spirit, whose team includes Fred Berger, producer of La La Land, which starred Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, making £343m at the box office worldwide. Berger has reassembled its music team, including music producer Marius de Vries.
Mister Smith Entertainment, which represents the films of Steven Spielberg's Amblin Partners in Europe, is financing and handling international sales.
David Garrett, its founder, told the Observer that they were inspired to take on the project after meeting Minghella and realising they had a “fresh and vibrant approach” to film-making: “He has a wonderful vision of how they want to make it.” They added: “It was the combination of Max and Fred and the La La Land music team that made it feel special.”
Minghella spent much of their childhood on film sets, appearing as an uncredited extra in their father's American civil war epic Cold Mountain. They went on to become a professional actor, starring in films including David Fincher's The Social Network and George Clooney's The Ides of March.  They are currently appearing in the TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale on Channel 4.
Minghella made their screenwriting debut last year on the acclaimed thriller The 9th Life of Louis Drax, which they adapted from Liz Jensen's novel, and which was directed by horror specialist Alexandre Aja.
The lead actor in Teen Spirit is Elle Fanning, whose films include Sofia Coppola's gothic chiller The Beguiled. In their new role, they play an aspiring singer who dreams of escape from their shattered family life.
The film-makers describe Teen Spirit as “a visceral and uplifting story about growing up, dreaming big, and finding your voice”.
The shoot is now taking place in and around London. A unit will also go to the Isle of Wight.
Anthony Minghella's daughter, Hannah, is also doing their father proud.  They are president of TriStar Pictures, the Sony Pictures unit established to focus on literary projects. They were previously president of production for Columbia Pictures, overseeing the development and production of movies that included Skyfall, the 23rd James Bond film.
In the WP article from last Monday, Will writes:
You say the nation — which is generally reluctant to declare a president a failure, thereby admitting that it made a mistake in choosing them — seems reluctant to give up on the first African-American president. Right! Because we all know that black men hold an unfair advantage in the labor market. You can see the evidence of it all around you. After decades of racial goodwill, shown to black workers as a result of the unfairly imposed guilt trip by radical race card-playing media types like me, black workers now have an unemployment rate of 13.4%. Right. Racial guilt, that's it.
Well, here's the deal, George. I hereby give you permission to set down the white man's burden. If you don't want to vote for the president, don't! Plenty of other voters seem to have found actual reasons to support him.
Arvin Balag invokes the provisions of the law in light of a sensational testimony that names them as being the one who delivered the fatal paddle hit on Horacio Castillo III
Published 7:52 PM, October 30, 2017
MANILA, Philippines – Arvin Balag, the Grand Praefectus of Aegis Juris fraternity, is exhausting the definitions of the law to try and get themselves out of murder charges for the death caused by hazing of first-year student law student Horacio Castillo III.
In their counter-affidavit submitted to the Department of Justice (DOJ) on Monday, October 30, Balag said there is no witness to show abuse of superior strength.
To charge someone with murder, an accuser must prove there was "treachery, taking advantage of superior strength” and other qualifications, in the death.
Balag is still detained inside the Senate after they were held in contempt for not answering questions in a committee investigation. They were allowed to submit their counter-affidavit with only their lawyer present in the DOJ, because a prosecutor was present at the time they subscribed to the affidavit inside the Senate.
“As stated above, abuse of superior strength cannot be appreciated in the instant case since no witness saw how the alleged killing was perpetrated,” Balag said in their affidavit.
“There was also no proof that the death of Atio was attended by a relative disparity in physical characteristics, usually translating into the age, gender, the physical size and the strength of the aggressor and the victim,” Balag said.
Balag's affidavit was filed in light of a sensational testimony by their fraternity brother Mark Anthony Ventura, who identified them as being the one who delivered the fatal paddle hit that left Castillo unconscious.
On Monday, the DOJ panel said it has not received Ventura's affidavit yet and that their right to submit the same has already been waived due to a lapsed deadline. Ventura submitted their affidavit to the Witness Protection Program (WPP).
The DOJ panel clarified that Ventura can eventually still be a witness. (READ: How Aegis Juris fratmen are defending themselves in Atio Castillo slay case)
Elements of murder
Balag also said: “The qualifying circumstances of employing means to weaken the defense, means or persons to insure or afford impunity cannot also be appreciated because of the fact that no proof of evidence was presented by the complainants that the same exist in the instant case.”
Take that assertion against Ventura's statement that Castillo was subjected to almost 4 hours of hazing. Ventura said more than 10 men punched Castillo until they were black and blue, after which they hit them with a spatula-like object.
Ventura also said Castillo was supposed to receive 11 paddles, but they collapsed on the 4th. After seeing them move, however, Ventura said Balag hit them a 5th time and that's when Castillo became unconscious.
But Balag countered: “Superiority in number does not necessarily amount to the qualifying circumstance of taking advantage of superior strength.”
On Monday, one of the fraternity men named by Ventura as being present during the September 17 hazing rites blocked their testimony. Alex Bose's lawyer said that Ventura's admission of their participation in the rites makes them the most guilty, and therefore not qualified to be state witness.
It is the court that has the final say on whether or not someone is going to be discharged as state witness. At this point, Ventura is still a respondent although they enjoy WPP benefits.
Ventura is the only one so far to admit to the hazing.  They are identified as the Secretary of Aegis Juris fraternity.
Other arguments
Balag also used the pre-existing heart condition defense, which was first introduced by the camp of John Paul Solano, citing the medico legal report and death certificate that says Castillo had Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy or HCM.
Balag also “categorically and specifically denied” knowledge or participation in the Facebook group chat, even though someone named “Arvin” was shown in those chats planning the initiation rites.
They were also again mentioned in another group chat post-death of Castillo, where alumni of the fraternity spoke of actions to protect their brothers. In that group chat, an alumnus said it was Balag's driver and Solano who took Castillo to the hospital.
Balag also said the screenshots of both group chats, even if true, are violations of their right to privacy of communication, and are therefore inadmissible evidence.
Solano has also named Balag as one of those they saw morning of September 17, when they were called to the fraternity library to help Castillo. Solano said that the convoy that took Castillo to the hospital was them on their motorcycle, Balag and Axel Hipe in Balag's black Fortuner, and Castillo in Ralph Trangia's red pickup.
“However, my alleged ownership of a vehicle found within or near the alleged scene of the incident, even if true, does not equate to the commission of hazing or murder without any supporting proof of evidence,” Balag said.
Aside from murder and violation of the anti-hazing law, Balag is facing charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. – Rappler.com
John McAfee unveiled the plans for their “first truly private smartphone” in Newsweek yesterday. They believe their device is the “most hack-proof phone” ever created. The $1,100 Android phone, called the McAfee Privacy Phone, was created through a partnership with cybersecurity firm MGT. It'll feature physical switches that allow the user to physically disconnect the battery, antennas for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and geolocation, the camera, and the microphone. McAfee also tells Newsweek that it'll be able to identify and then not connect to a Stingray or any other IMSI catcher device. It also features a web search anonymizer.
None of this sounds like it'll make a meaningful difference for users. Hardware isn't the problem when it comes to mobile privacy. Software is the key to securing a phone, whether the threat is remote malware or invasive cloud services. McAfee's device runs Android, which means it'll be as vulnerable as any other device to undisclosed bugs. Plus, without a first-rate security team behind it, it's hard to say how often the phone will be patched against the latest threats
Software vulnerabilities are an issue
Physical switches might give users peace of mind, but it also means that anyone else could switch the camera or microphone on and off, so long as they have physical access to the device. As for the Stingray protections, McAfee doesn't elaborate on how their technology works. I'm assuming it's a software feature. Existing apps already attempt to identify suspicious cell towers, and it's not clear how McAfee plans to improve on them. I'm also unsure how software could force a phone to not connect to that cell tower when the whole idea of a Stingray is to dupe a phone.
McAfee isn't the first guy to try and profit off people's fear of hackers, but unfortunately for him, privacy-focused hardware just isn't that good of a business. Lots of companies have attempted and failed to enter the privacy phone market. Silent Circle's Blackphone is likely the most recognizable device, and the company is reportedly millions of dollars in debt after its launch. Sirin Labs debuted a $16,000 privacy-centric Android phone last year, and it, too, has gone basically nowhere. BlackBerry consistently attempts to sell its devices to businesses over its privacy protections, and, as we all know, the company is in such dire straits that it's licensing its name to the highest bidder.
All of this is to say good luck with your phone, John McAfee, because the market is already saturated with privacy phone failures.
Jeremy Corbyn noted in their conference speech on Wednesday: “It is often said that elections can only be won from the centre ground. And in a way that's not wrong – so long as it's clear that the political centre of gravity isn't fixed or unmovable, nor is it where the establishment pundits like to think it is.”
Regardless of your political beliefs, it is an arithmetical fact that the path to 10 Downing Street involves building a coalition that contains centre-ground voters. Half of the public generally identify with the centre ground, saying they are “centre”, “slightly left of centre” or “slightly right of centre”. This compares with just 11% who say they are very or fairly rightwing – and 12% who say they are very or fairly leftwing.
In this year's general election Labour won over a few more of these “centre ground” voters than it did in 2015. Of those that voted, a third (32%) of centre-ground voters backed Labour in 2017 compared with the quarter (26%) who backed Ed Miliband's party two years ago. However, Corbyn's party is still far behind the Conservatives, who gained 50% of the centrist vote.
Our data shows that most of the “Labour surge” in June came from maximising support from the left, meaning there are few new votes to be found there. Simply put, in order to become prime minister, Corbyn will now need to win over more people from the centre.
But is the Labour leader correct about where the centre ground in British politics currently is?
Firstly, as YouGov's research has consistently found, many of Corbyn's policies are popular. When we tested various positions immediately after they became leader we found a majority (80%) of voters supported increasing the minimum wage, introducing a form of rent caps (74%), and increasing corporation tax (51%).

On nationalisation, our poll during the election campaign showed the public thought that many institutions should be run by the public sector, including the Royal Mail (65%), the railway companies (60%), the water companies (59%) and energy providers (53%). Also, since Corbyn became leader, the policy areas where the majority agree with Labour are increasing in importance among the public.
In the week Corbyn became Labour leader in September 2015, we showed respondents a list of policies from across the political spectrum and asked them which four or five they would like to be priorities over the next few years. When we asked that same question again this week, the biggest increases had been “abolition of tuition fees for students at university” (up from 15% to 20%) and “increase spending on the National Health Service” (up from 42% to 53%), making it the most popular policy.

Meanwhile the biggest decrease has been on a policy that was Labour's achilles heel in the 2015 election – immigration. Two years ago, “sharply reduce immigration” was the highest policy priority on 44%, but this has now dropped into third place (on 31%) behind “increase spending on the National Health Service” and “build more affordable homes” (on 36%).
So many of Labour's policies are appealing and also seen as being priorities, which raises the question: why did they not gain the support of more centrist voters this time around?
The answer is that elections aren't just about where the centre ground is on policy, but also where they are on leadership and competency. Even at the peak of Corbyn's popularity in the days before polling day, more centrist voters thought Theresa May would make a better prime minister (39%) than Corbyn would (30%). Furthermore, when we tested Labour's manifesto during the campaign, nearly half (44%) of centrists thought that while Labour “had lots of policies”, “they don't seem very well thought through”.
This will be the key challenge for Corbyn over the next few years.  They are right that elections are won among centrist voters, and also correct that many of their policies are popular there. But it is not enough for the centre ground to be convinced on their policies; they also need to be convinced by their ability to be prime minister.

Fernandinho has revealed they should return from the muscle strain that kept them out of Monday's defeat to Chelsea in '15 days or less'.
The 28-year-old was absent from the City team that lost 1-0 to Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium on Monday after picking up the injury in training.
There were fears they could be sidelined for up to a month but the midfielder tweeted on Wednesday to reassure fans they will be back sooner.
 They are likely to miss Saturday's trip to Norwich and Sunderland's visit to the Etihad on Wednesday.
But there is still a chance they could recover in time for the FA Cup fifth round tie with Chelsea on February 15 and Barcelona's visit in the Champions League three days later.
Martin Lawrence is going to don the fat suit anew in a third installment of Big Momma's House. We get the following scoop from our friends at IESB:
IESB's Robert Sanchez attended the SOUL MEN press day in Beverly Hills today and talked with producer David Friendly. Friendly says that Big Momma's House 3 is still in the works (it was rumored to be ready for 2008). They say it's currently in the script writing stage and will hopefully be ready for 2009 release. Big Momma's House (2000) and Big Momma's House 2 (2006) starred Martin Lawrence as an undercover FBI agent using a fat suit to impersonate a Southern granny.
Martin Lawrence comedies are peculiar train-wrecks that I try my best to avoid. I have tried to watch a few films of theirs and always leave the experience confused. I just don't find them funny, which is too bad because some of the premises are absolutely outlandish.
An FBI agent that does theirs investigating in drag and in a fat suit, is a stand alone film material. Somehow Lawrence has managed to make this into a trilogy, and again although I have never watched any of these films; morbid curiosity may one day get the better of me.
If anyone could star in a buddy cop movie where their partner is a drug sniffing Mallard duck, it would be Martin Lawrence.

Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) about whether they would take advantage of a tax loophole that would allow them to “defer capital gains taxes on the sale of assets divested in order to comply with ethics rules,” DeVos said, “I do not intend to take advantage of that loophole. I've already made that conclusion, that decision, and in fact it probably would be useful to note here that again, if confirmed, I will only take a salary of one dollar so I can be official, but I don't intend to take a salary either.”
91% of Polish internet users believe what they reveal online is safe
In a recent survey by CBOS 91% of Poles were recorded as believing the way they make use of the internet is safe. Of the remainder, 5% consider it a moderate risk.
The believers include some who make publicly visible their email address, name, pictures with their face, date of birth, marital and relationship status, interests, groups, religion, home address, and present location.
The most widely exposed information to full public view at 24% is photographs with face, followed by date of birth (15%), email address (13%), then marital status (12%).
The least widely exposed information for full public scrutiny is videos with visible faces (3%), then phone number (4%), home address (6%) and job / career details (7%).

Many Poles expose a lot more to known or controlled groups, such as friends or work colleagues, for example 50% exposing their email address.
The full table can be seen here on the CBOS website, in Polish.
The survey questions Polish attitudes to online safety, stating in the survey abstract:
With the development of the Internet, particularly social networking sites, more and more data on people is available on the Web and, significantly, most people put it there themselves on a voluntary basis. They supply information to be used not only by government agencies, such as the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), which, a few years ago, was exposed to the world by Edward Snowden, by companies which can obtain information about current or potential clients, but also by individuals or groups whose activities may pose a direct threat to the safety of Internet users.
Complete decliners with no social media information divulged, make up 20% of respondents. 40% make info visible only to known groups, and 40% with some unlimited access data.
Grouped by age, the most likely to post public information are generally younger, the 18-24 and 25-34 year groups making most information public, with 35-64 year olds defaulting to a limited audience.
Other key points to take away:
41% of respondents have had a computer virus, 32% more than once
37% had problems from false information, 35% more than once
80% have been offended by someone online
9% have met someone online who turned out to be someone else (catfish)
8% have been a victim of an internet scam
75% regularly install software updates on their devices
90% have an antivirus installed, and 54% have a firewall
The survey was carried out in July this year on 1044 adults

Hang Mioku, now 48, had their first plastic surgery procedure when they were 28; hooked from the beginning they moved to Japan where they had further operations - mostly to them face.
Following operation after operation, their face was eventually left enlarged and disfigured, but they would still look at themselves in the mirror and think they were beautiful.
Eventually the surgeons they visited refused to carry out any more work on them and one suggested that their obsession could be a sign of a psychological disorder.
When they returned home to Korea the surgery meant Hang's features had changed so much that their own parents didn't recognise them
After realising that the girl with the grossly swollen face was indeed their daughter their horrified parents took them to a doctor. Once again the possibility that Hang had a mental disorder was raised and they started treatment.
However, this treatment was too expensive for them to keep up and they soon fell back into old ways.
Amazingly, they found a doctor who was willing to give their silicone injects and, what's more, they then gave them a syringe and silicone of their own so they could self-inject.
When their supply of silicone ran out Hang resorted to injecting cooking oil into their face.
Them face became so grotesquely large that they were called "standing fan" by children in their neighbourhood - due to their large face and small body.
As Hang's notoriety spread they were featured on Korean TV. Viewers seeing the report took mercy on them and sent in enough donations to enable them to have surgery to reduce the size of their face.
During the first procedure surgeons removed 60g of foreign substance from Hang's face and 200g from their neck.
After several other sessions their face was left greatly reduced but still scarred and disfigured.
And it would seem that even Hang can now see the damage they have done; they now say that they would simply like their original face back.
All lanes of Johnson Ferry Road at Roswell Road in east Cobb County were reopened Tuesday at about 5:45 p.m., except for two southbound and two westbound lanes, according to the Georgia Department of Transportation.
All lanes of the road were closed in mid-afternoon because of a downed power line that was the result of a car accident. Initially, motorists had been urged to avoid the intersection for up to six hours.
Witness Matthew Chanin described the accident as horrendous.
“A black suburban rammed into an electrical pole, completely separating it from the ground and stopped all traffic at the busy intersection,” Channin said in an email.
Chanin said they and their girlfriend were waiting for an oil change at the Chevron, located on the same corner as the accident. They said they called 911 and watched as people tried to help the driver.
“I was able to get a picture of three courageous men who jumped into action to try and save the driver from the unexpected,” Chanin said. “The car was literally underneath a hanging electrical pole, spouting fluids, so these men risked their lives at this moment.”
It was not clear how many residents and business lost power as a result of the accident. Officials estimated it would be evening before power is restored to affected customers.

The concept one is actuallly a carryover from an ealier concept for Twilight's Equestria, which featured Fluttershy as the Lady of the Wild Hunt, basically a whole lot of critters and forest sprites.
I originally shelved the idea, and might still end up not including it, but playing the Empire campaign in Total Warhammer and experiences the awesome blend of cuteness and ferociousness that are the Demigryph Knights gave me an urgent craving to draw some kind of monstrous cavalry.
Anyways, the background for these guys is, that under Twilight's rule Equestria has become a more advanced, if somewhat disenchanted place, with places like the Everfree Forest long since cleared out and made safe.
This would include preserving certain species in captivity. I kinda imagine a huge menagerie in Canterlot, perhaps dedicated to Fluttershy's memory, filled with all kinds of creatures.
Seeing as they seem to be somewhat good natured, as well as being able to be trained, manticores would probably be at the very top of that list. It probably also wouldn't take long for some one training a manticore to ride it, because why wouldn't you want to ride a manticore?
UPDATE: did some cleanup, moved the manticore's head back a little to lessen the longcat effect

CAPCOM announced at the "Ace Attorney Series 15th Anniversary Talk & Latest News Special Stage" event at Tokyo Game Show on Saturday that it is developing a sequel to its Dai Gyakuten Saiban: Naruhodō Ryūnosuke no Bōken Nintendo 3DS game. The new game is titled Dai Gyakuten Saiban 2: Naruhodō Ryūnosuke no Kakugo . Capcom did not announce the game's platform or platforms, but promised that "more details will be announced later."
The video ends with the tagline, "…All the mysteries now — will be solved…"
Before the announcement, the stage event showed another video that looked back at the franchise's 15-year history:
CAPCOM released Dai Gyakuten Saiban for the Nintendo 3DS in July 2015. The game is set during the 18th century in Meiji Era Japan. The game's protagonist is Ryūnosuke Naruhodō, an ancestor of main series protagonist Ryūichi Naruhodō (Phoenix Wright). Ryūnosuke eventually travels to London to further their studies, where they meet Sherlock Holmes.
CAPCOM employee and translator Janet Hsu said in June that there were "a number of circumstances" preventing a localization of the game. Hsu commented, "Nowadays on the Internet lots of fans are directly asking us, 'Where's Daigyakuten Saiban?' On livestreams, even in the Japanese ones, people from the West will write in and ask where it is. Every time we say, we're sorry! Certain circumstances are kind of getting in the way."
Among my many farmer's market purchases this week were fresh chives, with lovely lilac blooms.
Chive flowers are edible, great in stir fries and salads. However, they have a strong onion flavor, so you don't want to pop a whole bloom in your mouth.
I also purchased some fresh, crisp spring peas. The combination of peas and chives- perfect for a tartine. Tartines are the open faced sandwiches I have shared with you in the past (Ricotta Cheese and Cherry Tomato & Roasted Red Pepper Hummus with Avocado)
The recipe took one trip to the Farmer's Market + 5 minutes prep time. Easy and yummy, give them a try!
Print Chive Flower and Spring Pea Tartines Ingredients 1/2 cup of fresh shelled peas 1 tablespoon tahini (optional) 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/8 teaspoon paprika A pinch of salt (to taste) 3 slices of bread, crusts removed 2 chive blooms (pull apart) and chopped stems Method Add all the ingredients, except bread and chive blooms, to a food processor or blender. Blend until course. Spread the pea hummus on the bread. Top with chive blooms and their chopped stems to taste. Notes Alternates: If you don't have chive blooms no problem. Use some chopped onions and/or radishes instead. Note: The pea hummus is based on Le Pain Quotidien's. 3.1 http://globalveg.com/2014/05/25/chive-flower-and-spring-pea-tartines/ Copyright: Global Veg
Interest among central banks is quite high in cryptocurrencies, and more generally in the underlying distributed ledger technology, for a broad range of financial services. Central banks around the world -- including Australia, Canada, China, England, Russia, Singapore, Sweden, and the US -- are engaged in some level of exploratory activity in blockchains, from working groups and studies to proofs of concept.
Many have noted the irony that monetary solutions based on decentralization, and a history of serving the "dark web" (that seeks to bypass the centralized controls and regulations implemented for state currencies) may someday become adopted and even dominated by global banking and financial services.
IC3 staff and members have been sought after for their expertise by central banks and regulators to elucidate the limits and possibilities of cryptocurrencies and smart contracts technology for a wide variety of use cases. Here are some notable highlights from recent events:
The Long Strange Trip from Hamilton's Bank to Today
Alexander Hamilton led a hard fought political battle against Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and others to establish the first central bank of the US, signed into law by George Washington in 1791. Hamilton modeled the bank after the Bank of England, and pushed the thesis that without a central bank, the growth and stability of the young US economy would be hindered. The First Bank of the US was an unquestionable economic success, but lasted only 20 years, failing to win sufficient political support to renew its charter in 1811. The notion of a US central bank remained a political football until the early 1900's. The "Bank War" of the 1830's is a fascinating account of high drama politics and soaring oratory (sadly missing in today's government) that ended in the demise of the Second Bank of the US.
The US financial industry operated through the 1800's with and without a central bank, with often more than a thousand competing state banks in operation, many offering unique banknotes that served as paper currencies of non-uniform value for the country. State and federal regulation of these banks were likewise often non-uniform. The Federal Reserve was established in 1913, precipitated by the "Bank Panic" of 1907, when J. P. Morgan coordinated an effort of several wealthy individuals and the U.S. Treasury to perform the role of a central bank, lending ten's of $M in a historic bailout of financial institutions.
As the concepts of investment vehicles, banking, and money in the U.S. have evolved, from notes backed by gold and silver to the fiat of today, so has the technology of financial services. The biggest changes came in the 1970's as computerized book-entry securities systems were adopted to streamline custody, clearing, and settlement in the equities markets. However, while a transaction today is initiated by a mouse click, multiple intermediaries are often involved in the back office processes, with manual, paper-based steps required to clear, settle and close certain transactions over a period of days.
Blockchain promises to disintermediate and compress these back end processes in time with higher accuracy, automation and visibility; freeing up capital and reducing costs. The World Economic Forum (WEF) published a year-long study in August 2016, "The Future of Financial Infrastructure: an Ambitious Look at How Blockchain Can Reshape Financial Services"
The report examines several use cases and how blockchain and smart contracts may be brought to bear; one such use case is depicted in the figures below from the 2016 WEF report (on pages 122-123).
Equity Post-trade ("As-is")
Equity Post-trade ("To-be" with blockchain and smart contracts)
While Hamilton faced strong broad-based opposition to their vision, we see a broad groundswell of support, albeit cautious and measured in some circles, for blockchain deployment, with most seeing ubiquitous usage as a matter of time. "Rather than stay at the margins of the finance industry, blockchain will become the beating heart of it," said Giancarlo Bruno, of the WEF in a statement released with the August 2016 report.
While we see a growing consensus for uses of blockchain in various aspects of financial services, such as the asupervisorstioned clearing and settlement of financial instruments, the case for central bank issued crytptocurrency is far from agreed.
In the early 1870s, inspired by the abolition of slavery and the Union victory in the American Civil War, French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi seized upon an idea. They would build a monumental gift for the United States, a gesture of friendship from a country that had helped secure its independence.
When Bartholdi visited the United States to gather support for the project, they identified Bedloe's Island in New York Harbor as the ideal site. It was right at the mouth of a major port, and was federally owned “land common to all the states.”
The neoclassical statue was designed in the image of Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom, raising a torch and bearing a tabula ansata, representing law. Bartholdi toyed with the idea of having the statue hold a broken chain, but feared such an explicit reference to slavery might be controversial. (The final statue does have a subtle chain at their feet.)
In 1875, the project was announced and fundraising began, led by French politician Édouard René de Laboulaye. Before the statue's design had been finalized, Bartholdi built the head and torch-bearing right arm and put them on display at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia and the Paris World's Fair to drum up support for the project.
Between rehearsals of Chicago with Robin Thicke and a super group that brings together Trent Reznor, Dave Grohl, Lindsey Buckingham and Queens of the Stone Age, the GRAMMYs' consulting sound engineer Doug Mountain took us on a tour of Staples Center and detailed the technology being used for Sunday's telecast.
As of 1 p.m. Friday (Jan. 24), there were up to 50 wireless microphones and 18 wireless guitar set ups -- and both those numbers will grow as each band comes in for rehearsal. The Reznor-Grohl-QOTSA outfit took the stage and spent a good 15 minutes getting the drum and electronics sound correct before rehearsing the song.
This media is not available on this platform.
They, like all of the 21 scheduled performances, run through the song four times. They then bring in the lights, camera and effects for another four run-throughs.
A voice boomed over the PA -- "Dave wants more shaker" -- after one run-through and as they set about building their two-song medley (GRAMMY organizers want us to keep it a secret), they very loudly applied one layer atop the other. Meanwhile, in other corners of the Staples Center, musicians were rehearsing for the Beatles special that will tape Monday. Among the songs to be covered: “While My Guitar Gently Weeps,” “Let it Be” and, a bit of an obscurity, “Hey Bulldog.”
The rehearsals will continue through Saturday night with the arrival of Madonna and, if time allows, Jay-Z and Beyonce, who are not expected until late Saturday night. They might be rehearsing the morning of the show.
This media is not available on this platform.
Mountain broke down the production by the numbers:
3 million watts of electricity will be used to power the venue and production.
4,000 staff members, but only 3,200 parking spaces.
1,000 video clips loaded for use during the show. About 200 of them will never be used.
230 audio frequencies in use during the show.
192 channels to feed audio signals to multi-track recordings.
170 tons of equipment hanging from the roof of Staples Center
64 JBL Vertec speakers.
21 subwoofers -- 16 in the air with five on the ground to rattle Staples.
17 cameras for the telecast -- three of which are Steadicams.
10 animators to create visual images for the performances.
10 video screens that collectively weight 3 tons.
10 smoke machines
8 tractor trailers of equipment.
5 tons is the weight of P!nk's flying rig alone.
0 pre-recorded lead vocals.
Barack Obama has agreed to a $400,000 fee for speaking to a prominent Wall Street firm, according to Charlie Gasparino of the Fox Business Network.
Former president Obama will speak to a health care conference sponsored by Cantor Fitzgerald in September, Gasparino reports.
The huge fee puts Obama at the top of the list of speaking fees for former government officials. Former Fed chair Ben Bernanke charges between $200,000 and $400,000, former Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner charges $200,000, and former President George Bush charges around $150,000, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Hillary Clinton received over $200,000 apiece for each of their speaking engagements at Goldman Sachs. Those payments later were used against them by political rivals, who argued they were evidence that the former Secretary of State was too close to Wall Street.
Gasparino points out that Obama has been out of office for less than 100 days.

Any speculation that Gov. Mike Pence would pass on a re-election bid following a highly contentious start to 2015 was extinguished Monday.
Indiana Republican Party Chairman Jeff Cardwell issued a statement on the party's website saying the 55-year-old governor would formally announce that he'd be seeking re-election in 2016 during the INDGOP's Spring Dinner in June.
"Gov. Mike Pence is a conservative leader and dedicated public servant who always puts Indiana first," Cardwell said in the statement. "We are excited the governor will formally announce their plans to seek re-election during our annual Spring Dinner, and we look forward to hearing their ideas for the future of our great state."
The governor's announcement will come less than two weeks before the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which Pence signed into law and revised earlier this year, goes into effect.

Selfishness is the moral position that one should act only for one's self-interest. When used consistently as an ethical principle, selfishness leads to institutionalized competition, a constant war of all against all, where power, not intelligence or compassion, controls what gets produced, what ideas are popularized, and the kind of rules one lives under.
A selfish person is one who constantly reduces everything, even global issues, to “me, myself and I.” Everything should be about what they want, what they desire, what they value, without regard to the fact that others may disagree and that we need to respect other people's wants, desires and values as long as they don't interfere with ours.
Breeding is the most selfish activity I can imagine. Having children is all about “me, myself and I.” People have children because they want a mini-me they can mold to their desires, because they want to perpetuate their bloodline or DNA, because they want to hide their homosexuality, because they want to prove their capacity for virility or motherhood, because their narrow and vain religious beliefs forbids them to abort, and so on. The most important reason, I think, is that breeding grants one a higher status: people with children are considered more valuable e.g. in workplace privileges and in health decisions. Basically, they hold society hostage because their children's livelihood depends on theirs.
Breeding can never be in the interest of the child, simply because the child in question does not exist at the time of the decision, not even as a potential. So breeding can never, by simple logic, be in the interest of the future person. So in whose interest is it? The fucking parents, always the fucking parents, those ego-filled parasites who expect society to praise them for having had sex and to raise their children for them. I know I've said this before, but it bears repeating: I sympathize with children, and have nothing against them, it's the parents I hate.
The selfishness of parents extends so far beyond breeding. When their children are growing up, they expect everything around them to adapt to the existence of their precious possessions. They demand that adults without children curb their behavior for their own petty benefit, instead of taking a more active part in parenting. We need censorship and self-censorship because they can't take the time to regulate what their children watch or hear, we need to allow them to bring their screaming babies everywhere because they can't afford babysitters, we need to lie to each other about sexual and physical abuse to not bruise parents' egos, and all the panoply of nonsense that slips under the door in the name of “what about the children?”
What can my family and friends do for me? What can my workplace do for me? What can society do for me? It's all about “me,” “me,” “me,” “me,” “me,” never about anyone or anything else. And then they whine about child support, one of the only mechanisms in this fucking crazy society that exists to support children's interests!
And don't get me started about imposing religion, gender, nationality and politics on a little child who cannot possibly comprehend or actually hold any of these social roles, because ey is not yet a social agent, and crushing their freedom and vitality with them. If you've done that to your child, and all parents have, know that I hate you and your kind.
Yea, you can come yap in my face about how your little baby is so pritty pritty and how ey goohs and gaahs and how you're so fucking happy that you think you're gonna have a heart attack every time the baby open eir eyes. So what? I can cite counter-examples. Anecdotes don't prove shit, and if you had any interest in the truth at all you'd at least know that.
Insofar as breeding goes, parents' mind seem to be comatose; their justifications for the act are curiously and completely absent, to a point where they seem as nonchalant about such a grave act as a fish would be flippant about the existence of water. We'd call this ridiculously negligent behavior if people put so little thought into any other major decision of their lives, like buying a car or a house, what to study in college, whether to leave one's religion, or who to marry. And yet when people take the decision to forcibly bring a new life into this world, in defiance of all the principles of ethics we otherwise so dutifully give lip service to, people are expected to praise them?
Furthermore, as dimasok points out in the comments, bringing a new life in to this world is a far more momentous act than the others I've listed, since it involves the life of another human being. So there can be no comparison between the two: compared to the grave consequences of breeding, decisions about what to consume or what to study are of little relative importance.
And they don't give a shit about the effects of their decision on the rest of society and the world. They don't care that we have more than seven billion people, that their lifestyle has an impact on their environment and the environment of the world, that their child will only get to live a Western lifestyle because of the exploitation of people in the Third World, that we didn't ask to be burdened with more children in our society, and so on. They don't give a shit because it doesn't affect them very much. After all, one child is just a drop in the bucket. They don't give a fuck what we think.
And why should they? We as a society keep telling them that they have a right to breed and that nothing can ever change that. So why should we blame them for feeling entitled to breed and being callous about it? They are merely agreeing with, and acting on the basis of, what they've been taught.
I haven't really talked about natalism specifically, but the case is not much better. We are told by court jesters like Bryan Caplan that natalism is validated by the need to constantly feed the capitalist system, to drive consumption, to drive innovation, and so on. At no point do they discuss the interests of the child, because the issue does not even register on their radar.
We know that these natalists are really doing it to sell books and get their articles read, that the primary objective of these books and articles is to provide the rationalization for breeders to feel as if they are doing something un-selfish, socially positive, progressive. They are engaged in the manufacture of mass delusion, a mass delusion which is not even necessary since most people just have children without thinking anyway. This lack of necessity explains why natalist thinkers are not in high demand yet, although growing panic about birth rates might create a more vibrant market for their brand of lies.
Natalist arguments, like theological arguments, set out to use rhetorical sleight of hand to prove a preordained conclusion: that breeding is desirable and ethically justifiable. But these arguments can only be valid if capitalism, with its uncontrollable growth and resulting need for constantly spiraling consumption and production, can itself be justified. If capitalism is undesirable, then there is no need for natalism. And capitalism is undesirable. There is no need to put profit before people, there is no need to benefit the elite of society against the masses of workers and unemployed, there is no need to kill and exploit people in the Third World for our lifestyle. There is just no need for capitalism to exist, and if there is no need for capitalism to exist, then there is no need for natalism.
I know what many of you must be thinking, that it's “common knowledge” that it's the childfree and antinatalists who are the selfish ones. But this is pure projection. I can't speak for the childfree community, but most people I know became antinatalists out of compassion for all life and anger at the suffering we inflict on each other. The projection enrages me because I don't know a group of less selfish people than antinatalists. It is a Big Lie delivered by a bunch of selfish people to tar noble and just people.
Life is an imposition. What is selfish about not wanting to impose one's will on other human beings? What is selfish about wanting the human beings that do exist to live the best life they can, without burdening them with more lives to feed and clothe? What is selfish about not imposing a new life on the society around us?
Natalists claim that it's selfish to not want children because people who don't have children end up not having to sacrifice their free time, money and well-being (even health) for children. One could say the exact same thing about a drug addiction. Is not having a drug addiction selfish? Since when is not sacrificing oneself to an evil cause selfish?
Breeding is a mass delusion. Natalism is a crock of shit meant to support that mass delusion. Together they are a clusterfuck of lies, projections and impositions.
On Feb. 1, the world will watch the state of Iowa as it leads the nominating contest for the next U.S. president. Campaigns have been made or lost in the state.
By the data, Iowa is of small significance to the overall 2016 election. The state has just 3 million of the U.S.'s nearly 319 million residents, so it doesn't have many votes in the Electoral College that will eventually elect a president from the parties' nominees. In the presidential nominations, too, Iowa doesn't mean much in terms of sheer numbers — for both the Republicans and the Democrats, the state makes up about 1 percent of delegates who later choose the nominees.
But, the state can mean everything because of the simple fact that its contest comes first. While a candidate doesn't need to win Iowa to win its party's nomination, results in Iowa are followed closely by the media and are an early signal of how the country as a whole will respond to the candidates. It also sets the state for the first primary, eight days later, in New Hampshire. In politics, momentum is king. If a candidate doesn't place highly in the early states, support and dollars typically begin to dry up, which means that Iowa often is successful at winnowing the field. In a race with many candidates, like the 2016 contest for the Republicans, how a politician fares in Iowa can determine whether they or they will remain on the ballots for the rest of the U.S.
In light of Iowa's pivotal role, here are answers to common questions about the Hawkeye State:
Why Is Iowa First?
By accident, the state captured the prime nominating spot in 1972 and has since kept it through stubborn determination. It's even written into Iowa law. The Code of Iowa states that the caucus must be held “at least eight days earlier than the scheduled date for any meeting, caucus, or primary which constitutes the first determined stage of the presidential nominating process in any other state, territory, or any group which has the authority to select delegates in the presidential nomination.”
Iowa doesn't go first because it is more important than other states. Iowa goes first, essentially, because it says so. It doesn't hurt that the caucus also brings in money to the state, although not as much as you might think.
Early nominating spots are coveted among the states because of the money that goes with them -- mostly in ad buys, media attention and candidate dedication to the early states. The presidential candidates have already made hundreds of trips to Iowa.

The State Department's top official dealing with North Korea made a quiet trip to Moscow on Monday to urge Russia to support new United Nations sanctions on North Korea. But though Russia agreed to a watered-down measure, the two countries are still far apart on how to resolve the crisis.
Joseph Yun, the State Department's special representative for North Korea policy, arrived in Moscow ahead of the Security Council vote on a new package of sanctions, on the regime of Kim Jong-un, which curtail its energy imports and textile exports but fall short of the full oil embargo the United States had initially proposed.
The Russian government had invited Yun as part of President Vladimir Putin's larger effort to elevate Russia's role in the ongoing North Korea crisis, which involves resistance by Moscow to further sanctions and a push for a return to the negotiating table with Pyongyang. As of last week, Yun's trip was on hold, administration officials said. But after the Kim regime's latest nuclear test, the drive for another Security Council resolution created new urgency and Yun was dispatched to Moscow.
“This visit is an example of our ongoing discussions with the international community to increase pressure on [North Korea],” said State Department spokesperson Justin Higgins. “The United States seeks stability and the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We remain open to negotiations towards that goal.”
The Russia foreign ministry issued a statement Tuesday with a very different take on Yun's meeting with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov. According to Moscow, the meeting was about dialogue, not pressure.
“The Russian side stressed that there is no other way to settle the problems of the Korean Peninsula, including the nuclear problem, other than by political and diplomatic means,” the ministry said. “The sides noted readiness for joint efforts in the interests of finding comprehensive approaches to ensuring security [in] Northeastern Asia, including in the context of the implementation of the Russian-Chinese roadmap for the Korean settlement.” For several months, Russia and China have been proposing a “freeze for freeze” option whereby the United States and South Korea would curtail military exercises in exchange for North Korea freezing its missile and nuclear tests. Both Washington and Seoul have publicly rejected that idea multiple times.
President Trump played down the new Security Council resolution and promised further sanctions Tuesday at the White House, speaking to the press after their meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.
“We think it's just another very small step — not a big deal,” Trump said about the latest U.N. resolution. “[Secretary of State] Rex [Tillerson] and I were just discussing not knowing if it has any impact, but it's nice to get a 15-to-nothing vote. Those sanctions are nothing compared to ultimately what will have to happen.”
A senior administration official briefed reporters last week and also said that the Trump administration has no intention of sitting down with the Kim regime under current conditions and that the plan is to continue to increase pressure on Pyongyang.
“The amount of pressure North Korea has been put under economically is still far short of what we applied to Iran or even Iraq,” the official said. “There is a long way to go before North Korea is going to feel the pressure they would need to feel to change their calculus.”
Yun last visited Moscow in April. They have also kept open a channel to the North Korean regime through its U.N. representatives in New York. Working with the Russian government is a part of their diplomatic responsibilities, and they often travel to other countries involved in the North Korea issue as well.
Some experts hold out hope that Yun's efforts will produce an opening for direct dialogue with the Kim regime that the Trump White House might take advantage of.
“The smart strategy is to keep pushing the sanctions ball forward with the [Russians and Chinese], but at the same time showing them we are serious about their interests, which is starting a dialogue,” said former nuclear negotiator Joel Wit. “It takes away their opportunity to blame us, and probably makes them willing to be more cooperative with us.”
Others are skeptical there is enough common ground between the United States on one side and Russia and China on the other to build on. On Capitol Hill on Tuesday, lawmakers from both parties grilled Trump administration officials to move forward with tougher sanctions on North Korea, even without China's or Russia's permission.
“Unfortunately, years have been wasted as sanctions have been weak, allowing North Korea to have the financial access to build its nuclear and missile programs,” said House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Edward R. Royce (R-Calif.). “The time for that pressure is now.”
Gov. Larry Hogan is refusing to endorse the Maryland school board's plan for helping low-performing schools, saying state board members were hamstrung by a new law limiting what the plan can include.
The General Assembly passed legislation this year that limits ways the state can try to reform its lowest-performing schools — those in the bottom 5 percent. The Republican governor vetoed that bill, but the Democratic-controlled legislature overrode him.
In a letter sent this week to U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Hogan wrote that the state board could not craft a sufficient plan under the “impossible circumstances” imposed by the state law. All states must submit plans for improving low-performing schools to comply with the federal Every Student Succeeds Act.
Hogan's signature is not required for state education officials to send the plan to the federal government for review. They still intend to submit the plan Monday, a spokesperson for the Maryland State Department of Education said.
The Protect Our Schools Act passed by the Assembly this year prohibits the state school board from requiring test scores to count for more than 65 percent of a school's performance ranking. And it would prevent the state from taking several actions to improve those schools, including converting them to charter schools, bringing in private management, giving the students vouchers to attend private schools or putting the schools into a special statewide "recovery" school district.
In a letter to state school board President Andy Smarick, Hogan wrote that the legislation resulted in a plan that will preserve “the status quo in failing schools.”
But some education advocates were quick to criticize the governor for not backing the school board's plan.
By not supporting the plan, Hogan is disregarding months of feedback from parents and nonprofit organizations, said Sean Johnson, legislative director of the Maryland State Education Association, the union for public school teachers.
“I hope the strong support from all of those stakeholders makes clear that Maryland is really committed to meaningful and positive education reforms — even if it's not the privatization and test-and-punish approach that I guess Larry Hogan would rather champion,” Johnson said.
Some state school board members, nearly all of whom were appointed by Hogan, have chafed at the legislation and supported Hogan's veto. Some members had suggested using more radical measures to reform failing schools, including turning them over to charter school operators.
Smarick said although members disagreed with the Protect Our Schools Act, they “had to follow the letter of the state and federal law. That was our job.”
Senate Minority Leader J.B. Jennings said the state law unfairly limits options for improving struggling schools.
“The Democratic leadership pushed through a horrible piece of legislation that, in my mind, didn't put kids first. It put special interests first,” said Jennings, a Republican who represents parts of Harford and Baltimore counties.
The U.S. Department of Education reviews each state's plan for improving struggling schools and can recommend changes. Though Hogan's signature is not required on the document, its absence will signal to federal officials that they don't support it.

“I worry that he's, in a sense, encouraging Betsy DeVos to reject the plan, which puts $250 million worth of federal funding at risk,” said Del. Eric Luedtke, a lead sponsor of the Protect Our Schools Act. He's also a former public school teacher.
DeVos has been a champion of offering families alternatives to traditional neighborhood public schools, such as charter schools and vouchers that allow students to attend private schools.
The federal government so far has not rejected any state plans, but has suggested changes to some.
“More fundamentally, he's kind of doubling down on this right-wing school reform agenda,” said Luedtke, a Montgomery County Democrat. “I think somebody needs to explain to the governor there are more ways to improve schools than privatization.”
Sen. Craig Zucker, another sponsor of Protect Our Schools, suggested that the governor is favoring politics over schoolchildren.
“This has always been about Maryland educators and Maryland students. This isn't about the governor. This is about the future of our children,” said Zucker, a Montgomery County Democrat. “This was a well-thought-out piece of legislation where Maryland can be a leader in terms of education reform.”
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker similarly refused to sign their state's plan for low-performing schools.
"Your bureaucratic proposal does little to challenge the status quo for the benefit of Wisconsin's students," Walker wrote to state superintendent Tony Evers. Evers is one of several Democrats running for Wisconsin governor in 2018 against Walker, a Republican.

Martin Behaim with their Erdapfel
Behaim's Erdapfel
Projection of the Behaim Erdapfel, 1492
Oceanic area described on the Martin Behaim globe.
The Erdapfel (German: lit. earth apple) is a terrestrial globe produced by Martin Behaim from 1490–1492. The Erdapfel is the oldest surviving terrestrial globe. It is constructed of a laminated linen ball in two halves, reinforced with wood and overlaid with a map painted by Georg Glockendon.[1]
The Americas are not included, as Columbus returned to Spain no sooner than March 1493. The globe shows an enlarged Eurasian continent and an empty ocean between Europe and Asia. The mythical Saint Brendan's Island is included. Cipangu (Japan) is oversized and well south of its true position; Martellus's map is followed in developing an enormous phantom peninsula east of the Golden Chersonese (Malaysia).
The idea to call the globe "apple" may be related to the Reichsapfel ("Imperial Apple", Globus cruciger) which was also kept in Nuremberg along with the Imperial Regalia (Reichskleinodien).
From its creation until early in the 16th century, it stood in a reception room in the Nuremberg town hall. After that time, it was held by the Behaim family. In 1907, it was transferred to the Germanic Museum in Nuremberg. In 1992, it was moved for some time to the Vienna University of Technology, to be studied at high resolution by the Behaim Digital Globe Project.[2] In 2011, a second digitalization by the German National Museum began.[3]
Terrestrial globes are known to have been made from antiquity, such as The Globe of Crates. None are known to have survived, even as fragments. A celestial globe, the Farnese Atlas, has survived from the second century AD.

A woman holds a gun in the dark (Shutterstock)
A Minnesota journalist says their parents, who are Muslim Americans, were victims of an armed hate crime in a Minneapolis suburb, Gawker reports.
Around 11:00 PM last Friday, Majida and Adly Abumayaleh drove several miles from their house in Maple Grove to pick up their teenage son from a party in a residential neighborhood. Before they were able to get out of the car, a woman approached the couple's vehicle, demanded they roll down their windows, and became violent when the Abumayalehs didn't comply.
The attacker, a “self-appointed watchwoman” named Nancy Kay Knoble, began pounding on the car's windows and doors, and commanding the Abumayalehs to get out of the vehicle. And that's when Knoble took out their pellet gun. The couple they were threatening, however, didn't know the firearm wasn't a more powerful model.
“She pulled the rifle and said open the window or I'll shoot you guys,” Adly Abumayaleh tells local news station KARE. Fearful, the Abumayalehs complied. The couple exited the vehicle and, while Knoble held their gun to Adly's back, the trio approached the house where the Abumayalehs' son was spending time with friends.
As promised, the Abumayalehs' child was where they said they would be and Knoble, satisfied that the family was not a threat severe enough to keep holding at gunpoint, “backed off,” according to KARE.
But the Abumayaleh family was shaken. “I thought, I am going to die this night,” Majida says tearfully.
Police arrested Knoble at their home nearby and recovered the crime scene pellet gun.
Mnar Muhawesh, the Abumayalehs' daughter, is the founder and editor of Mint Press News. The media outlet engages in “independent watchdog journalism exposing detrimental effects of American imperialism, corporatocracy & fading away of our civil liberties,” according to its website.
On Tuesday, Muhawesh reported their parents' attack on Facebook:
Mint Press News reposted Muhawesh's statement the following morning, adding that Knoble's assault “could be a hate crime against a Muslim-American family.”
On Thursday, Muhawesh tweeted police records showing Knoble faces charges related assault and “terrorist threats.”

Later today, Muhawesh tweeted a more existential question about the nature and appearance of who we as Americans view as “suspicious.”
by Robert Romano, Americans for Limited Government
Often, talk of the nationâ€™s founding principles is discarded as an irrelevancy in public discourse. But in truth they are more salient than ever as power in Washington grows to untold heights. And those who still value liberty must take note of this unprecedented rise and take action if this nation is to ever take steps back toward constitutionally limited government.
In an effort to cast off the shackles of never-ending federal mandates from Washington, Michigan State Representative Paul Opsommer (R-DeWitt) has offered â€œHouse Concurrent Resolution No. 4â€ to â€œaffirm Michiganâ€™s sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and to urge the federal government to halt its practice of imposing mandates upon the states for purposes not enumerated by the Constitution of the United States.â€
It is an example to be emulated by states across the Union, and one on which a new emphasis by states upon their sovereignty ought to be built. The first step, of course, proceeds from the statement of a single principle: The states are sovereign entities.
They derive said sovereignty from the consent of the governed. Thatâ€™s the only source of political and legal legitimacy through which any claim to sovereignty may be justified as being representative of the wills of those governed, and by which it may be carried forth in accordance with the natural rights of the people.
Only if those governed accept the political arrangement may the government legitimately exercise its powers. And in the immediate case of the United States, those powers are explicitly enumerated in the Federal Constitution. Very specifically, the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution states, â€œThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited to it by the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.â€
This inherent limit upon the authority allows the federal government only to exercise those powers contained in the Constitution. But it also provides that the states may be limited in their powers by the Constitution. Thus is Americaâ€™s unique federal system.
However, constitutionally limited government is in grave jeopardy today. The House Concurrent Resolution in Michigan states that â€œToday, in 2009, the states are demonstrably treated as agents of the federal government, andâ€¦ [m]any federal mandates from previous administrations and some now pending from the present administration and from Congress may further violate the Constitution of the United Statesâ€¦â€
These include, but are hardly limited to, federal education standards, fuel standards, health care standards, and environmental standards, as well as Supreme Court rulings vacating statesâ€™ rightful powers including the power to enact term limits as in U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton, etc. Regardless of the motivation for each mandate, the impact is always the same: the states and the people lose their respective powers and liberty to govern their own affairs, and the federal Leviathan increases in its own unenumerated powers.
Eventually, the government willâ€”if liberty and limited government is not defendedâ€”turn on the people it is sworn to protect and defend. This is the greatest danger, and history suggests is the inevitable outcome of the progressive growth of the powers of central authority. Already, provisions of the Constitutionâ€”the only true limits on the powers of the governmentâ€”are largely ignored or reinterpreted to suit the interests of the federal government.
The danger is that this central authority will give rise to tyranny. And it is incumbent upon the states and the people to use the constitutional system to defend against this. Michigan and their people, should it enact House Concurrent Resolution No. 4, are acting well within their rights to remind the federal government that Michigan is indeed a sovereign entity that derives its just powers from the consent of the governed.
Itâ€™s a small step, but through many small steps, the states and the people will take back their respective powers and rights, and the government once again will be limited by its own Constitution.

Britain loses £18billion a year because its richest companies squirrel away their fortunes overseas out of sight of the taxman, a new investigation reveals.
FTSE companies are among Britain's biggest tax dodgers, a new study reveals
The figure is 12 times as much as the £1.5billion lost through benefit fraud, and would pay our legal aid bill nine times over or cover the cost of the war in Afghanistan.
All but two of the companies in the FTSE 100 have put money into overseas tax havens. The biggest group is the four big high street banks, who have 1,649 subsidiaries in low-tax bases.
Advertising giant WPP has the most tax haven-based businesses, with 611 registered in locations such as Jersey and the Cayman Islands, according to campaign group ActionAid.
But, rather than clamp down on the practice, chancellor George Osborne has signalled an £840million tax break for multinationals using tax havens.
Chris Jordan, ActionAidâs tax justice expert, said: âWhile multinationals use tax havens to avoid paying their fair share, ordinary people in both rich and poor countries are left to pick up the bill.

âSpending on doctors, nurses and other essential services gets cut for those who need it most.â
The multinationals listed on the FTSE 100 have a total of 32,216 subsidiary companies between them, with one in four based in tax havens. The only two not using havens are metals mining company Fresnillo and financial services provider Hargreaves Lansdown.
There are 600 subsidiaries based in no-tax Jersey, with another 400 in the zero-rate Cayman Islands and 300 in Luxembourg.
Others are drawn to Delaware in the US because it makes few demands on companies to disclose information about themselves.
Mr Jordan added: âAt a time when all countries are desperate for revenues, the UK government canât afford to turn a blind eye.â
The companies insisted many of their subsidiaries were genuine businesses and that they were still among Britainâs top taxpayers.
Responding to the investigation, the Treasury insisted: âThe government has demonstrated a clear commitment to tackling all forms of tax avoidance and evasion.
âAt Budget this year we set out a strategic approach, placing emphasis on tackling avoidance at the root, rather than just treating the symptoms.â
While India is all set to get the new generation Elantra in the first week of September, Hyundai has pulled wraps off the 2017 Elantra Sport in the US with the sedan getting more power and performance. Hyundai terms the Sport as the most powerful Elantra to be ever produced by the company with power increased to 197bhp from the 1.6-litre turbocharged petrol engine. The torque output has also been increased to a whopping 257Nm. The standard variants continue to draw power from the 2.0-litre and 1.4-litre petrol engines producing 145bhp and 126hp respectively on the new generation Elantra.
Hyundai Elantra Sport Face
New Hyundai Elantra ₹ 15 - 18 Lakh * ( Expected Price ) FIND OUT MORE
The 2017 Hyundai Elantra Sport distinguishes itself with the sportier bumper that comes with LED fog lights and a black grille surround, replacing chrome. The side skirts have been revised, and a reworked rear incorporates a new bumper and diffuser that gives sporty touch and also helps reduce visual bulk. Completing the list of sporty touches is the dual exhaust system and new alloy wheels on the popular sedan.
Hyundai Elantra Sport Rear
The cabin has also gone through several updates on the new Hyundai Elantra Sport and comes with a flat-bottom steering wheel, faux carbon fibre accents across the cabin, sports seats with contrast stitching and with embossed 'Sport' logos on the seatbacks. Equipment levels remain largely the same on the Elantra Sport with Hyundai known to jack up its new age cars with a host of tech.
Hyundai Elantra Sport Features
Making the US spec new generation Hyundai Elantra Sport fun for driving enthusiasts is the 6-speed manual, while owners can also opt for the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission option. The latter also comes with paddle shifters for a more engaging driving experience. Furthermore, the suspension setup has been revised to an independent multi-link rear unit for improved handling. Hyundai US hasn't revealed prices yet on the Sport version but did say that the performance sedan will make it to the country later this year.
Hyundai Elantra Sport Engine
Hyundai has no plans of introducing the 2017 Elantra Sport in India. Instead, the India-spec new generation Hyundai Elantra will continue to retain the 1.6-litre petrol and diesel engines from the outgoing version, albeit in a re-tuned avatar. Transmission options will include a 6-speed manual or automatic and prices are expected to start around ₹ 15 lakh (ex-showroom), when it goes on sale in the country.

The 2004 election gave President George W. Bush a second term in office and expanded Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. So soon afterward, they pledged to spend the “political capital” they said he'd earned on a longtime conservative priority — the partial privatization of Social Security.
The effort failed. Despite those sizable GOP majorities and the president's own barnstorming across the country to sell their proposal, creating private accounts for Social Security became so toxic that it was never brought to a vote in either the House or Senate.
Rather than ushering in a new era of Republican dominance, the fight rejuvenated the Democratic Party's fortunes and helped pave the way to its takeover of Congress in the 2006 midterms.
So as both parties prepare for two years of unified Republican control of Washington — with a battle over Obamacare repeal looming, and a potential effort by House Speaker Paul Ryan to slash social welfare spending — everyone involved, from the Democratic opposition to President-elect Trump, could learn some lessons from the Social Security reform fight of 2005.
Those lessons include: an election victory is in no sense a blank check for the winning party, unified partisan opposition can work — and fighting to preserve safety-net programs can be very good politics indeed.
President Bush misjudged — or misrepresented — their mandate
Almost every victorious presidential candidate claims to have earned a “mandate” to enact their respective policy agendas, as Julia Azari has written. Those claims are often exaggerated, and they can evaporate fast.
Bush proposed incorporating private accounts into Social Security during both their 2000 and 2004 campaigns. But those proposals contained few details and rarely rose to the top of their agenda. In 2004, the Iraq War, fears of terrorism, the state of the economy, same-sex marriage, and discussion of both candidates' character dominated far more public attention. A Gallup poll shortly after the election found that a mere 1 percent of voters said Social Security was one of top two most important issues affecting their votes.
So Bush's rapid decision to make Social Security reform their top domestic priority was quickly greeted with raised eyebrows. “For reasons that continue to confound me,” former Harry Reid aide Jim Manley says, “both the president and [his top political adviser] Karl Rove concluded after the election that they had a mandate” on Social Security.
Privatization appealed to the president's desire to make a major historic impact — “[Bush] and Rove thought it would be the defining domestic legacy of their second term,” Peter Baker writes in Days of Fire, their history of the Bush presidency. And since they had won several difficult legislative victories in their first term — two big rounds of tax cuts, a Medicare prescription drug benefit, and authorization for the Iraq War — the Bush team thought they could pull it off.
Democrats decided to oppose Bush rather than make a deal — and it paid off
Bush's team quickly set about trying to convince the public that they wanted these reforms too. The chief argument the president pitched was that Social Security was facing an imminent funding “crisis” requiring major reform. They made the case in their State of the Union in February 2005, and immediately afterward, they barnstormed the country trying to drum up support, campaigning particularly in red states represented by Democratic senators.
But despite their defeat, Democrats were in no mood to play ball. The new Democratic Senate leader, Harry Reid — coming to power in a state Bush won, after the previous leader, Tom Daschle, lost their own reelection — quickly concluded that Bush's proposal so struck at the social welfare state that, as Manley puts it, “There was no other option but to fight it.”
So Democrats pushed back. In think tanks, on blogs, in activist groups, and in Congress, they sought to rebut the president's case — arguing that there was no imminent crisis, that private accounts would in fact worsen the program's financial situation, and that privatization meant putting much of the public's retirement savings at the mercy of the markets.
As the debate played out, even moderate red state Democrats temperamentally inclined toward bipartisanship, like then-Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, took the temperature of their constituents and decided that privatization was a loser. According to Reid's recounting in their memoirs, the president's campaigning in Montana only annoyed Baucus and cemented their commitment to the Democratic opposition.
Democrats also resisted calls from the press and centrist policy advocates to commit to their own Social Security reform. “When Dianne Feinstein of California, who was also sympathetic to the White House's position, signaled that they might propose an alternative plan, Senator Baucus quickly convinced them to abandon the idea,” Reid writes. And an aide to Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House, told the Boston Globe that, when asked when Democrats would release their own plan, they often gave the same response: "Never. Does never work for you?"
Even by early February, New York Times reporter Robin Toner could report on “a general anxiety attack in the Republican center over Social Security.” They wrote that there was “no real consensus on how to achieve the president's domestic goals or even, perhaps, whether doing so is worth the price.”
Bush's public campaigning failed to win voters to their side. A Washington Post/ABC poll showed that in January, 55 percent of respondents disapproved of their Social Security handling — and by April, 64 percent did.
There was no particular moment when the initiative died, but the issue receded from the public agenda as all the major players became convinced it could not pass. In the end, the centerpiece of Bush's second-term domestic agenda was never even brought to a vote. “Leader Pelosi and Sen. Reid have a lot of legislation to celebrate, but they take a particular pride in defeating this,” says Manley. “This was for all the marbles.”
The bigger picture: Screwing around with people's benefits just isn't popular
There's an even more intuitive reason why Bush's Social Security reform failed. As Talking Points Memo founder Josh Marshall, who extensively covered the debate in 2005, puts it: “The biggest thing was simply that it was really unpopular.”
Bush's two rounds of tax cuts and Medicare Part D involved giving voters stuff — Social Security privatization instead was about changing benefits voters were already slated to get. “It was taking something that was working and making it something that was very risky, inherently risky and could have very negative consequences for individual people,” Marshall says. “And the more people found out about it, the more people were opposed to it.”
Interestingly enough, as the GOP prepares to assume unified control of Washington, the Republican who seems most cognizant of that decade-old lesson is Trump himself.
Trump's policy preferences on many issues appear malleable, but their instincts on big-picture political questions are reasonably consistent. Throughout the primaries, they set themselves apart from the rest of the Republican field by adamantly refusing to cut benefits, saying they wouldn't let people “die on the streets” and that he'd replace Obamacare with “something terrific.”
I was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid. Huckabee copied me. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2015
Yet the Republican majorities in Congress may have other ideas. The GOP leadership currently supports pushing through a time-delayed repeal of Obamacare before agreeing on any replacement. House Speaker Paul Ryan has long pushed for restructuring Medicare and Medicaid.
Democrats who remember the failed Bush effort in 2005 are eager for the GOP to tackle those issues. “Make our day,” Chuck Schumer said in December, in reference to Ryan's Medicare plan. That's not a mandate. It's an invitation.
As the 2015 Los Angeles Special Olympics World Games gets underway, athletes and fans can be seen traversing the streets of LA as they head to and from competitions. However, despite the crowds of supporters here for the games, The Shriver Report Snapshot reveals that 18% of Americans say they have never heard of an intellectual disability.
The release of the Shriver Report Snapshot: Insight into Intellectual Disabilities coincides with the start of the World Games and the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The report reveals the nation's changing perception of many of the issues associated with intellectual disabilities, and some of the results are surprising.
The poll from Shriver Media and Special Olympics International, with the support of the Richard and Cecilia Attias Foundation, surveyed 2,021 adults over the course of three days. Participants were asked about whether they knew someone, would hire someone, or marry someone with intellectual disabilities, as well as their thoughts on when using the “R-word” (retard) was appropriate.
“[The poll] does tell us who we are as a nation, what we think, feel, and believe about people with intellectual disabilities, and that directly, I think, affects the health -mental, emotional, physical health- of people with intellectual disabilities and their families,” Maria Shriver said.
While only a little over half (56%) of those surveyed knew someone with intellectual disabilities, 83% say they would be comfortable working with someone with intellectual disabilities, and 89% say they would be comfortable having their child be in the same classroom as a child with intellectual disabilities.
However while most Americans seem to have a positive outlook towards interacting with people with intellectual disabilities, they're actions don't always support their views. While 93% of Americans believe that adults with intellectual disabilities should be encouraged to have jobs, only 80% of Americans would be at least somewhat comfortable employing someone with an intellectual disability.
“[People with intellectual disabilities] want to have fully integrated lives, and while Americans think that's a good idea, they don't really know how to go about doing that,” Shriver said.
The uneasiness of interacting with people with intellectual disabilities increases with age, as millennials, specifically millennial women, were found to be the most positive and inclusive group.
“Millennial women are open, they're progressive, they see the world in a different way. They see it more label-less I think, than perhaps previous generations,” Shriver said.
Shriver said this attitude doesn't only apply towards how millennial women view people with intellectual disabilities, but also other areas such as gender and politics.
In order to shrink the number of Americans who feel uncomfortable interacting with those with intellectual disabilities, or have never even heard of one, fostering interactions is key towards changing America's perspective in the coming years.
This is something Shriver knows their mother would be pushing for. Shriver's mother, Eunice Shriver, founded the Special Olympics in 1968 after hosting Camp Shriver in their backyard, which became the foundation for today's Special Olympics World Games. Going out and making a new friend, seeing a Special Olympics World Games competition, or volunteering are just some of the things Shriver encourages the public to do with their new “Let's Change the Game” initiative.
The attitude of not only America, but the world may be changing in the coming years as well with the $25 million donation from the Golisano Foundation to help create more healthy communities throughout the globe. The healthy communities initiative started with 14 pilot countries, and now plans to grow with the Special Olympics' largest donation they have ever received.
The hope is to create better health services to provide year-round support to people with intellectual disabilities. More healthy communities will also help foster greater acceptance.
In the next 25 years, Shriver hopes to see a nation that will harbor no reservations towards people with intellectual disabilities. Rather than only half the nation knowing someone with intellectual disabilities, they hope to see that number at 100% in order to create an environment that fully accepts people with intellectual disabilities.

Steve Souders posted on Runtime Page Optimizer a tool that you can think of as a performance proxy. It sits on the server side, and cleans up content before it is sent back to the browser.
What can it do? Steve let us know:
RPO automatically implements many of the best practices from my book and YSlow, so the guys from Aptimize contacted me and showed me an early version. Here are the performance improvements RPO delivers: minifies, combines and compresses JavaScript files
minifies, combines and compresses stylesheets
combines images into CSS sprites
inlines images inside the stylesheet
turns on gzip compression
sets far future Expires headers
loads scripts asynchronously RPO reduces the number of HTTP requests as well as reducing the amount of data that is transmitted, resulting in a page that loads faster. In doing this the big question is, how much overhead does this add at runtime? RPO caches the resources it generates (combined scripts, combined stylesheets, sprites). The primary realtime cost is changing the HTML markup. Static pages, after they are massaged, are also cached. Dynamic HTML can be optimized without a significant slowdown, much less than what's gained by adding these performance benefits.
Steve had another couple of interesting posts recently:

? Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach is planning to use provisional ballots during the upcoming elections and then throw out all of the votes for state and local races cast by the thousands of voters who register to vote at motor vehicle offices without providing proof of citizenship.
An email sent from Kobach's office to county election officials outlines the state's proposed plans for implementing a two-tiered election system in the wake of a federal court order requiring Kansas to allow these voters to cast ballots at least in the federal races.
The email sent by Election Director Bryan Caskey tells local election officials that the secretary of state has not approved a shorter “federal only” ballot.
Instead, Kobach wants to institute a “partial provisional” process that allows election officials to go back into those provisional ballots and throw out any votes cast in state and local races and count only votes cast for president and U.S. Senate and House.
The state had a similar process in place in the 2014 elections in which a few hundred voters who registered with a federal form were affected. But implementing it in the upcoming elections is estimated to affect as many as 50,000 who registered to vote when they got their driver's licenses without providing the citizenship documentation.
Kobach's move comes despite Shawnee County District Judge Franklin Theis finding in January that “no authority exists in the Kansas Secretary of State to encumber the voting process” as they did in the 2014 elections.
Related story ? Kansas election officials still unsure who will be allowed to vote in which races
Kobach's planned response to a federal court order requiring them to register motor voter applicants “flies in the face” of the decision by Theis, who ruled Kansas law does not allow Kobach to implement a bifurcated voter registration system, said Micah Kubic, executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas.
The ACLU contends voters covered by the federal court order should be added to the voter registration rolls and allowed to vote using a regular ballot.
Kobach did not immediately respond to a call to their office seeking comment.
Kobach has championed the documentation requirement as a way to prevent non-citizens from voting, particularly immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Critics contend the requirement suppresses turnout.
Kansas law has required voters to provide proof of citizenship since January 2013.
“It is a bad law, and we as citizens of Kansas do better to recognize it as bad law. It is not something that can be tweaked,” said Marge Ahrens, co-president of the League of Women Voters of Kansas.
“It is not manageable, it is written for no reason. These were laws that were designed for a problem that does not exist and still does not exist,” they said.
U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson noted in their decision last month that the evidence shows only three instances in Kansas where noncitizens voted in a federal election between 1995 and 2013, and about 14 noncitizens confused about their eligibility who attempted to register during that period.
Alabama, Arizona and Georgia also have documentary proof of citizenship laws to register to vote, but Alabama and Georgia don't enforce them. Arizona enforces its law for some registrants but doesn't require applicants registering to vote at motor vehicle offices to submit any additional documents beyond what is needed to get a driver's license.
The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals has set August arguments over Robinson's order, but in the meantime upheld their ruling while the appeal plays out.
The email from the secretary of state's office says a temporary regulation is “being promulgated to formalize the process in Kansas' code of regulations.”
Clint Blaes, spokesperson for Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt, said the attorney general's office has not yet received any proposed regulations from Kobach, but would review them in the same manner as any other proposed regulation.
“The secretary of state is representing themselves in this lawsuit,” Blaes said. “Therefore, the attorney general is not involved in either the lawsuit or the operation of the secretary of state's office.”
There's no work like government work. Look what dropped out of the tree: the guide to the consultants' gravy train 2012 to 2016. This is just NSW privatisations mind you. The mind boggles at how much taxpayer money has been crisped on other consultants, and in all states.
Unlike the feds, who at least have the decency to disclose their gargantuan consultant fees clearly on the Austender website, finding how much the states flung to the cuff-linked buccaneers of consultancy is not easy, often impossible in fact.
The document of which we speak, a spreadsheet, boasts the anodyne title: NSW Treasury Consultant Expenditure on Key Projects 2011-12 to 2015-16.
Here are a few of the rippers. The “Disability and Customer Care Services Transfer”, read flogging of the state rights to care for disabled people, and an $830 million property portfolio, demonstrates EY suffers no disability when it comes to fee-charging. It picked up $5.5 million, then a further $4.5 million, while mining investment bankers Ironstone Capital Advisory raked in $3.9 million and $3.2 million. That deal is ongoing.
The biggie was the sale of the NSW electricity transmission and distribution assets, some of which went off to the Cayman Islands. This one is dubbed “Electricity Generation Assets Project”.
Goldman Sachs, which can't even file a proper set of financial statements in this country, got $4.6 million for financial advice, KPMG $4.4 million for tax and accounting advice and Baker & McKenzie $5.9 million for lawyering.
Then there was another $3.3 million for Goldman in the next year, and another $3.1 million for KPMG, Baker & McKenzie $6 million, $4 million more for Goldman, plus another $2 million for Goldman. EY was in for $7.5 million in 2015 then another eye-watering $17 million for tax advice and accounting while Allens didn't miss out with its $6 million and a further $14 million for paper shuffling. Oh, and UBS won $14 million
Privatisation of the ports was a beauty too with the $4.3 billion sale of Port Botany and Port Kembla reaping Morgan Stanley a cool $15 million as financial advisor. PwC picked up $13.4 million and Minters $11.3 million.
The sale of Newcastle Port saw Morgan Stanley get another $7.8 million, PwC $5.3 million and Minters $5.8 million.
Millions also went to PR firms Kreab & Gavin Anderson and Newgate for “issues management and communications” on the deals, which means keeping them out of the media as much as possible, which they did.
These were but the first class passengers on the NSW privatisation gravy train. There were 110 consultant fees all up on this spreadsheet, to those advice-givers noted above, and to many others. Let's hope the money is well spent … the money from the privatisations that is.
WALPOLE (CBS) — Walpole Police have released surveillance video of a man who allegedly told a liquor store clerk they would give them AIDS during an attempted armed robbery on Sunday.
The incident happened at East Walpole Liquor Store on Route 1 shortly before 3 p.m.
Police say the would-be robber told the clerk “gimme all the money, or I'll give you AIDS.” Investigators say the man had a small “weapon” of some kind with a red tip in their hand, but they couldn't confirm what it was.
The clerk responded by pulling a bat from behind the counter, and the man ran away, police said. It's unclear in which direction they ran. No one was hurt.
In the video, the man appears to be wearing a dark-colored hooded sweatshirt with multi-colored stripes, a dark-colored bandana over their face, dark gloves, and light-colored pants.
The video also appears to show them randomly pressing buttons on the cash register to try and open it before leaving the store.
As of Sunday night, no arrests had been made. Anyone with information is asked to call Walpole Police at (508) 668-1212
Dear All The Single Ladies: Have you ever fretted that there's something weird and/or running through your veins that's stopping you from getting a partner? Well, stop worrying! Because there is, and it is making you want to hiss and throw seaweed at anyone who comes near you so that you can go home and wank in solitary confinement.
A study out of the University of Michigan has determined that women with a wealth of male hormones are actually more prone to masturbate and less likely to want to have sex with a partner. 105 men and 91 women were pulled and asked questions about their sex life as well as undergoing a cheek swab to determine testosterone levels. As it turns out, the amount of hormones in a man's system has nothing to do with how often they think about masturbation or sex. But on the other hand (your primary hand being busy, doy), women with high testosterone levels are less likely to want sex, preferring instead to masturbate. This is corroborated by the fact that women in long-term relationships have lower testosterone.

Finnish study: Smoking and drinking coffee might prevent Parkinson's disease
The largest daily newspaper in Finland, Helsingin Sanomat, is reporting that a Finnish university study suggests smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee may reduce the risk of getting Parkinson's disease.
A lengthy history of continuous smoking reduces the risk 36-50 percent and drinking coffee regularly another 33 percent. The exact cause behind the phenomena is unknown at this point.
The results are from a study article originating from the University of Helsinki in Finland. The paper considered the latest research on the subject. Reviewing literature and previous study results gave an indication that the above factors are linked to the intestinal bacterial strain composition.
Linking Smoking, Coffee, Urate, and Parkinson's Disease
While the etiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is still obscure, there is evidence for lifestyle factors influencing disease risk. Best established are the inverse associations with smoking and coffee consumption. In other contexts there is evidence that health effects of lifestyle factors may depend on gut microbiome composition. Considering the gastrointestinal involvement in PD, it was recently speculated, that the associations between smoking, coffee, and PD risk could be mediated by gut microbiota. Here we review such a possible mediatory role of gut microbiota taking into account recent findings on microbiome composition in PD and extending the scope also to urate.
You can find the full paper here: Linking Smoking, Coffee, Urate, and Parkinson's Disease - A Role for Gut Microbiota?
The debate continues. In 2014 another study (Parkinson disease and smoking revisited) reached the following conclusion:
Our data support the notion that patients with PD are able to quit smoking more easily than controls. These findings are compatible with a decreased responsiveness to nicotine during the prodromal phase of PD. We propose that ease of smoking cessation is an aspect of premanifest PD similar to olfactory dysfunction, REM sleep disorders, or constipation and suggests that the apparent “neuroprotective” effect of smoking observed in epidemiologic studies is due to reverse causation.

A translation of a letter from a retired miner from Asturias, where miners have been on indefinite strike for weeks, explaining the dispute and giving its background.
I've worked for twenty five years in the mines. I first went down the mine when I was 18 and I would like to say that I am amazed by a lot of comments that I'm reading about mining and early retirement. I'm going to give you my perspective.
Firstly the struggle which the miners are carrying out at the moment isn't to ask for money. It is that they respect the agreement that was signed last year between the Ministry of Industry and the miners' unions, and which had subsidies designated until 2018. This money was from the European Community and not from the Spanish government. It isn't money that came from any Spanish people to help us as many people who are criticising us so much seem to think.
Regarding this money what I, like almost all mining families ask myself is, where is the part of the money from the Mining Funds that was supposedly going to the creation of alternative industries in the coalfields, after the closure of the mines? Well, like in many other sectors, this money has been handled by the politicians and the unions. With part of this money, for example, Señor Gabino de Lorenzo, the ex-mayor of Olviedo, paid for new streetlights in their city, the new Palace of Expositions and Congresses and many other projects. Señora Felgeroso, the ex-mayor of Gijon, spent it on the Technical University and other projects.
In the Valle de Turon, in the Caudal coalfield, where I live, there have been 600 deaths in the mines (the ones that we know about, as in the civil war they burned the previous archives) from 1889 till 2006 when they closed them. Of course they did build a sports centre, which when they opened it didn't have any toilets and is practically unused. All around us everywhere there are heaps of rubble, which bit by bit they are trying to clear up. But reindustrialization, which is what will create stable work so that there is still life in the region, almost nothing.
Secondly, I am amazed to see that lots of people object to this subsidy, I didn't want to write this but there are subsidies to other sectors like livestock farming, agriculture, fishing and many more. Personally I am happy about that, I would rather that the subsidies went to workers than that they went to those thieves who rob us every day.
Thirdly, after the end of the civil war, I think that many of you don't know that the miners worked an hour a day for free for many years, to repair what Francoism destroyed, when in our houses there was not enough to eat.
Four. In 1962 the miners started a strike which spread all over Spain, in which we won many of the rights that all the Spanish people have up till now and which they are trying to snatch away from us. In this strike there were many beatings, many people imprisoned, and many people who were exiled to other provinces of Spain, separated from their families, and who only returned in 1980.
Five. Regarding early retirement, it is a myth that miners can retire at forty and you talk about quantities of euros as if we had won the lottery. The reality is different, in the payments which people who have retired early receive, a part is made up of their extra payments. We make social security payments of 50%, so every two years we work, we pay an extra year of social security, for example I have worked in the mines for 25 years and I have paid 37 and a half years of social security payments, how many of you think you have made the same level of payments?
Six. You say that the coal they bring from abroad is cheaper than Spanish coal, I'm not convinced but taking it as true, do you want to see us working like slaves like in other countries? I don't want any worker anywhere in the world to be a slave.
I'm going to write this because it really happened. I've worked alongside workmates from the Czech Republic and Poland, when they came to Asturias and started to buy things in the shops, they were amazed because they could buy the amount they wanted and in their own country they couldn't do that. The first Christmas they spent with us they bought a bar of turron (traditional Christmas sweet) in each hand. We asked them why they did that and they said in their country they couldn't afford it and their wages only gave them enough to eat, and that badly. What I want to say is that if we don't defend our rights we will suffer the same.
Seven. Regarding the roadblocks on the motorways I will say to everyone who is complaining because the miners have made it difficult to get to work or study and who say that when they have problems in their company, they will go to the workplaces of others to “annoy them”. I will say to them that whenever other comrades from other industries came to ask for help do defend their jobs, we stopped work for 24 hours, giving support here and abroad.
In the time of the strikes of the English miners, we stopped work and we made a collection to send to them so they could feed their families. Does anybody doubt that we would unite with any affected workers? But it seems that now it's too much effort even to ask others for help. Supporting one another is fundamental, but what we do is the opposite and so those at the top always play with an advantage.
If all the Spanish workers were as united as the miners, the rulers of this country would think long and hard before making the cuts they are making now, I can assure you. Think about who is really stopping you going to work or going to class, with firing people so easy now and the cuts in education. The people who are stopping you are the politicians.
I would also like to say to the people who say that we should go to Madrid to the doors of the Ministry and “leave everybody else in peace”, yes, we have gone there, but the censorship in the media means maybe they are not giving you all the facts.
I strongly believe that a worker who defends their rights is not a terrorist like now they are calling us for fighting to defend the wellbeing of our families.
I invite you all to leave your houses and defend what is yours. Staying at home, you are letting them bit by bit bring hunger into your lives.
They want our children and yours to be illiterate like us, that we see the walls of the schools more from the outside than the inside, because an illiterate people are more easy to rule.
Keep yourselves informed. Question everything you see on the television, now you have internet, mobiles, you can be in permanent contact, organise, in the way that you want, pacifically or directly on the barricades, but organise! Make objectives to achieve quickly as the government moves very quickly when things are in their favour and they know it.
Take the word “fear” and the phrase “for what, it's not going to change anything” out of your minds and take control of your future.
If there is anything you don't understand in what I've written or you want to ask me a question about something specific, if I can, I will answer with pleasure.
Many thanks to those who have supported us from other provinces and from other countries.
Salud

While the Spirit and Opportunity rovers this summer soldiered on after more than five years on Mars (despite a number of glitches), an intrepid bot called the benthic rover created by scientists at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) showed its chops as a remote research vehicle by spending most of July traveling over the Pacific Ocean floor about 40 kilometers off the California coast, some 900 meters below sea level.
Robotic voyagers today give scientists the ability to continuously study remote places and phenomena previously available only in snapshots. MBARI's rover afforded researchers a close-up view of life on the deep seafloor, collecting information they're hoping will help document the effects of climate change on marine life as the oceans warm. The aquatic roamer took 18 different measurements (each one taking about a day to complete) of how much oxygen is being consumed by the community of organisms living in the ocean floor's sediment. From there, scientists hope to calculate how much food the creatures are consuming.
Although researchers are still analyzing the oxygen figures, MBARI marine biologist Ken Smith says the fact that the scientists now have so much data to work with proves the rover performed well.
Smith has been developing the benthic rover with MBARI project engineer Alana Sherman over the past four years. They designed it to creep slowly across the seabed at a rate of one meter per minute, stopping every three to five meters to examine the sediment and organisms in its path. One of the researchers' goals is to determine how deep-sea animals find enough particles of organic detritus, known as "marine snow," for sustenance in the absence of plant life.
The rover uses probes to record oxygen levels in the underwater sediment as well as acoustic scanners to sense the presence of worms and other animals as deep as 10 centimeters into the mud.
The researchers shielded the rover's electronics and batteries inside titanium pressure spheres so the vehicle could withstand 420 kilograms per square meter of water pressure. Another important feature are the large yellow blocks of buoyant foam attached to the vehicle that help support much of its 1,400-kilogram weight (making it weigh only 45 kilograms underwater) so that its tractorlike treads do not get bogged down on the seafloor.
To avoid the problem of loose sediment affecting the rover's measuring equipment, the researchers programmed the device to sense the direction of the prevailing current, and move only in an up-current direction, so that any stirred-up mud and particles would be carried away from the front of the vehicle.
During its July mission, the rover was tethered via a long cable to the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS) Ocean Observatory Test Bed. This provided the vehicle with power and a communications link, although the goal is to make the rover battery-operated and autonomous by year-end. "We used a cable this time so we could troubleshoot any problems," Smith says.
Once the rover is autonomous, it will store data for six months on its own. "You'll throw it off the ship, and then you send an acoustic signal demanding it to drop its weights when you want to retrieve it," Smith says. The researchers are planning at some point to outfit the rover with an acoustic modem so it can communicate information in real-time with buoys, which can then relay messages to researchers on board ships or onshore.
The rover's next mission will be to continue measuring sediment samples at its underwater stomping ground in Monterey Bay for two and a half months this fall. In 2010 the researchers plan to increase the stakes, sending their creation on a six-month crawl of the ocean floor 220 kilometers off the central California coast at a depth of about 4,000 meters (its depth limit is 6,000 meters). Success in these endeavors could see the rover sent to study the seabed near Antarctica or hooked up to a deep-water observatory several hundred kilometers off the coast of Washington State.
This Bank Holiday weekend is huge for so many teams in the Airtricity League. Friday sees the end of the first series in the Premier Division and Monday sees the start of the second. 16 games and for many, it's time to move. We look at the pick of the storylines to follow.
1) Can Sligo Rovers re-stamp their authority on the League?
Barring goal difference at the start of this season, Sligo Rovers have been top of the League of Ireland table for over a full calander year. They go into tonight's game with 2011 champions Shamrock Rovers on the back of a mini-wobble which saw them lose to Pats in Inchicore and draw with Drogheda last Saturday. It's stretching to call 5 dropped points all season as a mini-wobble, but thats what happens when you open the season with 8 straight wins. Failure to beat a Shamrock Rovers side suffering their own crisis in confidence, could see Derry top tonight if they beat Limerick. The sides meet on Monday in the Showground in what is sure to be a terrific encounter. 6 points in 4 days for Sligo over the pre-season favourites and their nearest challngers would go a long way to dismissing any talk of mini-wobbles again.
2) Can Shamrock Rovers kick-start their season?
Advertisement
Can ANY team kick-start a season that's a third of the way through? If they fail to win tonight at home to Sligo, they'll be at least 13 points behind the champions. An even more worrying statistic for Rovers fans is that there'll also be a minimum of 7 teams between them. Rovers under rookie manager Trevor Croly have only won 2 league games so far and have lost their last 2, including that shocking defeat to then-bottom UCD. A third consecutive loss tonight will have even the most ardent of Rovers fans forgetting about league success this year. A loss to Dundalk on Monday will have them more worried about relegation than Euroopean qualification. 2 wins for the Tallaght side will have them right back in the hunt.
3) Can St Patrick's Athletic get back on track?
Pats followed their excellent win over Sligo with 2 1-1 draws at home to Derry and Bohs. Lack of goals is clearly an issue for Pats as they dominated long periods in both games without making the possession pay dividends. Strikers Christy Fagan and Anto Flood have only 2 goals between them this season (both for Flood) and they'll need to quickly find their scoring boots if Pats are to challenge. This weekend they face tricky trips to Cork and Drogheda. There's been one goal or less scored in the last 8 league games Pats have played in Cork and both leagues games they played in Drogheda last season finished scoreless. Would anyone really be surprised if they drew both games nil-nil this weekend? If they do they go from challngers to md-table obscurity prettyy quickly.

4) How huge is this weekend for Shelbourne's fight with relegation?
Despite being bottom of the table, Shels have to be relatively confident ahead of this weekend's games having picked up 2 fine points in Cork and Limerick in the last 2 weeks. Robert Bayly's red card in Limerick showed they still have the potential to shoot themselves in the foot though and they really can't afford that to happen this weekend as they host UCD (tonight) and Bray (Monday). Both sides are a single point ahead of Shels and such are the stuggles for the trio against the top 8 clubs that any win in these games will be huge.
5) Will any of the middle pack make a move?
7 points cover Dundalk in 4th and Bohemians in 9th. Back to back wins for any of the sides in that range would see them quickly move up the table. Cork may be best placed to do so. Their late goal dramas have been well documented and if they can play for 90 minutes, they may go on a run. This weekend sees Cork play twice at home with Pats (Friday) and Limerick (Sunday) visiting. They'll be looking to make themselves 100% safe, and then push on for a charge at the European places.
Whatever happens, enjoy the games
How can you say any more about a man and football player for whom so much has been written?
Perhaps we should start with the fact that while this somewhat late announcement may seem ill-timed given the fanbase's impatience with Manning's play right now, instead the timing might actually be perfect.
That's what the media - and even many fans - have been saying about Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning all season.
Despite doing this with Demaryius Thomas on Sunday Night Football on 4th and 1 against the Lions:
Or this with Emmanuel Sanders against the Chiefs, the Lions, the Raiders and the Browns.
And while Manning has been taking a beating in the press, their commitment to their teammates and coaches, their fans, the sport and humanity in general has never waned.
Despite six tough games in which the offense has sputtered, the five-time NFL MVP continues to fight for the victory, pulling their offense up when needed and always celebrating a defense that has helped keep them and the team at 6-0 rather than what easily could have been 0-6.
Yes, so much has been written about Manning, and yet there is always more to say about a player whose continual sportsmanship, even in the face of defeat, criticism and adversity always invokes two words - Class. Act.
Even Owen Daniels, a free agent who has been working with Manning for just a few months, sees this quality. Defending Manning after the Chiefs game, Daniels pointed out that the quarterback is doing whatever they can for the team.
"I can't imagine how hard it is for them to learn a new offense after he's done their thing for so long," Daniels said. "He's so unselfish about it, a great team player."
Manning's stats last season were remarkable by normal quarterback's standards but sub-par for the future Hall-of-Famer - throwing 39 touchdown passes (third-highest of their career) and 4,727 yards (second-highest of their career). Only Andrew Luck threw more TDs in 2014 with 40.
Nevertheless, the "drop-off" at the end of the 2014 season, culminating with the disheartening playoff loss to the Indianapolis Colts plus inconsistent play in these first six games has left many fans wondering if Manning has what it takes to finish out this season.
It can be lonely at the top when things aren't going well. But as Manning has proved over and over - and over again - they are above their critics.
They continue to display humility, a sense of humor and sincere appreciation for the sport of football, their fans everywhere and humanity in general. They raise millions of dollars in every community where they have been part of its football world, and they always show compassion to those facing tough times, whether football fans or not.
This remarkable feat is above all else why Manning earns our Sportsman of the Year for 2015.
As this season nears the midway point and the critics are vocal in their complaints, Manning continues to ignore them and concentrate only on what they can control - improving their game, helping their team win and doing what they can to build up communities around him.
Just a month ago, Denver Broncos announced that Manning's "Chattanooga Heroes Fund" to raise money for the families of service members killed in a shooting rampage in July, had reached the $1 million mark.
Before opening day, Manning surprised a woman dying of breast cancer with two tickets to the Ravens game.
Manning's visit with children in the hospital and outreach to a fan's family whose son had been killed in a car accident were just common practices during their summer workouts. On their 39th birthday in March, No. 18 spent the day visiting wounded veterans.
As we have come to expect, despite any of our doubts in this man, Manning's penchant for good will and sportsmanship seems to have no end. Also, he's funny. He'll make a fool of themselves and not care.
But what they do care about is winning and being a good person. That's a really fortunate - but often rare - combination.
Ozark Orange's very articulate nomination of Manning this summer said as much:
"I know their 2014 season wasn't everything we'd hoped for, whether it was age, or injury or whatever. And I know that there is some division in the Broncos fan base between those who want them to play forever, and those who are ready to move on. But he's still the kind of guy who does things to make other players better. Things like spending extra time outside of scheduled team activities with receivers to improve their route running, timing, and communication. Things like leading by example when it comes to work ethic and preparation. He's seeing lots of changes this season including new coaches, new players, and a new offense. I'm not sure how much they like those changes, but he's not being a prima donna and complaining about them. Instead, their response is to work harder, and try to get better. When it comes to off-the-field activities, who are you going to find in the NFL that does more for communities and charities? Their charities and foundations have helped and continue to help people in need in Denver, Indianapolis, New Orleans, and probably other places I don't know about. And they take time and gives of themselves to comfort sick and injured people in hospitals and grieving families."
For all the shortcomings we like to nitpick as football fans on Manning's game - many of which the 14-time Pro Bowler would not disagree with - we should be able to agree on one thing.
Broncos Country is damn lucky to have Manning as a Bronco.
All their magic is used up. No more miracle recoveries. A remarkable career reaching its logical end. ...Then they go out and fools you again. -Kevin Van Valkenburg, ESPN senior writer, on Peyton Manning.
Recently, ESPN senior writer Kevin Van Valkenburg discussed the "audacity of Manning" to beat teams with their mind even if their body is aging.
"When you watch them wince and grimace after every hit, when you see their passes float and die in the wind, when they try to roll out and their feet move like he's trudging through ankle-deep snow, the only logical conclusion to draw is that he's done," Van Valeknburg wrote of our SOTY. "All their magic used up. No more miracle recoveries. A remarkable career reaching, sad as the truth might be, its logical end. Then they go out and fools you again."
Then they go out and fools you again.
Congratulations on a well-deserved honor, Peyton.
Keep on fooling us...maybe we'll deserve you in the end.
Stay tuned for more Class of 2014 Hall of Fame announcements in the days ahead...

"There are organizations that may not on a daily basis think about sex workers that are now putting their lobbying machines into motion for it," said Baskin, co-director of the Sex Workers Project at the New York City-based Urban Justice Center.
What few realize, however, is that New York is not the only state where condom possession is used to target and arrest people suspected of engaging in prostitution. If passed, the New York bill would be a first-of-its-kind law, according to bill sponsors and sex worker advocates across the nation, perhaps paving the way for similar policies in other places.
"Prostitution is a scary issue for politicians to take up," said Stephany Ashley, programs director at St. James Infirmary, a San Francisco non-profit that helps about 6,000 former and current sex workers a year. "I think this would open up the doors for a lot of other cities and states to do the same."
A former sex worker herself, Ashley oversees all of St. James' services and frequently counsels the men and women who come through its doors. Over and over, they speak with clients who say they limit the number of condoms they'll carry, for fear of arrest. Others hide condoms in sanitarily questionable places -- think used bleach bottles -- to conceal them from cops. "Nobody should ever have to make a choice to put themselves at that kind of risk," they said.
In 1994, in the midst of the AIDS crisis, San Francisco's legislative body passed a non-binding resolution that urged the police to stop confiscating condoms, and the district attorney to stop using them as evidence of prostitution. Both parties initially implemented the policy, but over time they have stopped honoring it, according to Naomi Akers, the executive director at St. James. "We need to have our own legislation," said Ashley. "We need to follow the lead of New York."
Robert Childs runs the North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition, which assists groups that include sex workers, drug users, and undocumented immigrants. On weekly walking trips through East Durham's subsidized housing projects, Childs and their team spoke regularly with out-of-work moms engaged in sex work who were afraid that carrying multiple condoms would lead to arrest. So their team devised an alternate delivery route: They drop condoms in bushes so that individuals don't have to carry them all at once.
The irony does not escape him: "It's very strange, in order to promote something that would be beneficial to the greater society, we have to be sneaky," Childs said. "As a fiscal conservative, you should be really worried about that, because [limiting condom use] leads to HIV, Hep C, and then we spend a lot of money paying for these diseases."
To be clear: Condom possession in itself is not illegal in New York, nor in any other state. Rather, the fact that condoms can be used in court as evidence of prostitution means that police will sometimes confiscate condoms, interrogate those carrying several, and use them as part of the basis for arrest. A law like the one in New York would clarify that possession is permitted, quelling fears among those who want to use them. "If there is no way an item will ever be used as evidence, then there's no excuse to ever take it or put it in an arrest sheet," said Baskin.
Getting pregnant soon after giving birth is linked to an increased risk of complications for both mother and baby, which is why some women choose to get an intrauterine device (IUD) or implant—known as long-lasting reversible contraceptives (LARC)—inserted at the hospital right after childbirth. Now, a new study published in the journal Contraception shows that increased insurance coverage is making it easier for women to get these methods of birth control at the hospital after delivery.
Insurance providers cover the tying of fallopian tubes, but coverage for LARC after giving birth is relatively new—even though LARC are considered to be one of the most effective forms of birth control, with a failure rate of less than 1% when used as directed. Data suggests that up to 60% of low income women who say they want an IUD or implant do not come in for a follow-up appointment after birth, possibly due to barriers like childcare and transportation.
Reimbursement for insertion of the IUD or implant after delivery wasn't offered before 2012, but after South Carolina became the first state to cover the practice, it's now covered in 19 states. Eight more states are currently considering it, the study authors say.
MORE: Why The Most Effective Form Of Birth Control Is The One No One Uses
The study authors wanted to better understand why Medicaid agencies in different states were—or weren't—paying for immediate postpartum LARC, so they called up representatives at 40 Medicaid agencies and asked them.
Medicaid agencies that did cover LARC right after childbirth cited maternal health benefits. Pregnancies that happen between 12-24 months after the first pregnancy have been associated with an increased risk of low birth rate, preterm birth and stillbirth, says Michelle Moniz, assistant professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology in the University of Michigan Health System and one of the study's authors. The agencies also cited cost-savings. While a LARC device costs $600-$775, a birth resulting from an unplanned pregnancy using public funds costs about $11,600, the study notes.
Agencies that didn't offer reimbursement cited the high upfront cost of LARC devices and a lack of clinicians asking for the practice to be covered. LARC, like nearly all birth control, isn't without risks. There is a greater risk of an IUD falling out—called expulsion—if a woman has it inserted after delivery. “But the important corollary to that is there's not a higher risk of complications from the IUD, such as infection or damage to the uterus,” says Moniz. The contraceptive implant, which goes into the arm, has no increased risk of falling out, they add.
Here are the states where the practice is covered by Medicaid:
UMHS
While American women have been slow to embrace forms of LARC like IUDs compared to women in other countries, evidence suggests that interest is increasing. February 2015 data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested that IUD use increased 83% from 2006–2010 to 2011–2013, and implants tripled in use in the same period. Another 2015 study, also published in the journal Contraception, found that among 500 female health care providers, 42% used LARC, which is significantly higher than the general population.
“A concerning number of states do not currently cover this service, despite its known effectiveness and cost savings,” the study authors write. “Efforts to remove reimbursement barriers should focus on clearly communicating to policymakers the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of immediate postpartum LARC in women who desire it.”

So, you read the headline, and you saw the picture. We bet you didn't think that dog looked like much of a bad boy. But Rex was just that. In fact, they came close to being put to sleep because they were so aggressive towards people. It took two people working together just to give them their dinner. One person would have to draw their attention to the other end of the kennel, while another quickly slipped in their dinner bowl.
They were so ferocious that they would stick their head out of their dog run to snatch wild rabbits and kill them. Rex's backstory was unknown and it's quite likely that they suffered tremendous abuse at the hands of humans, and like many dogs who suffer a similar fate, Rex may have just lost their ability to trust others and turned to aggression as a coping mechanism. Even the caring workers at Puriton Horse and Animal Rescue were near the end of their rope, although they hoped Rex would eventually turn a new leaf. And to everyone's surprise, everything changed for Rex when they met Geraldine.

It's a Story of Boy Meets Girl, Beauty Meets Beast, and Well… Dog Meets Goose.
The Workers Feared for the Worst the First Time Geraldine Approached Rex's Pen.
“At first we thought they were chasing them and they were fighting about who was boss, but they stood up for themselves and that was that, they just fell for each other,” Sheila Brislin, who runs Puriton, explained. “They snuggle down together and Rex puts their leg over them to protect them In the morning they have breakfast together. It's really sweet to see them.”
But to Everyone's Surprise, They Became Fast Friends!

They might seem like an odd couple, and they are from the outside looking in. But when you hear their backstories, it starts to make a lot of sense. Rex was rescued from a scrapyard, where they had spent all their life until the age of three chained up. The original shelter that rescued them couldn't handle him, though. They bit everyone who came near, and would bark aggressively at everyone. Geraldine had been a family pet, but eventually their family couldn't handle them They were brought to Puriton and placed with the other birds, but they only had eyes for Rex.
Now, the Two of Them Cuddle Every Night.

They Play Together for Hours Every Day.
And Go for Long Walks in the Woods Together. How Romantic!

Now Rex is calm and contented, as is Geraldine. This animal odd couple proves that all you need is love and you can overcome any barrier, be it emotional traumas, or even inter-species romance!

The upcoming season of Arrow is expanding its roster of comic book characters and the additions include Caity Lotz as Black Canary. Canary is an important character to the mythology of Oliver Queen, but when she's not hanging around Star City, she's with their other group, the Birds of Prey.
In an interview with TV Guide, executive producer Marc Guggenheim says the creative team behind Arrow is toying with the idea of including the group in the TV series.
“We have an idea for how to do our version of Birds of Prey. When you think about it, we have a lot of pieces. It's a lot like the Suicide Squad. As we continue to populate our world with new characters and some returning people from last year, you start to go, “We're really close to that!” We saw this awesome bit of production art for a new set that we realized plays into Birds of Prey completely. Our Art Department wasn't even intending that! There's certainly a momentum towards that, but everything has to happen in due time. With respect to Birds of Prey specifically, there's an actor that we particularly need to make that piece work and we need to check on them availability.”
Any theories on what actor they are refering to? Or what character they might be playing? We've got money on Barbara Gordon or it could be Jessica De Gouw, who played The Huntress in two episodes during the show's first season. Sounds off with your ideas below!
Originally created in 1996, “Birds of Prey” has long since been a collection of female heroes (and villains) in the DC universe. Its members have included Black Canary, Batgirl/Oracle, Huntress, Lady Shiva, Hawkgirl and Katana. The group previously had their own short-lived TV series on The WB which only lasted one season.
Arrow season 2 premieres on Wednesday, October 9th at 8 p.m. ET/PT.
When Google showed off its vision for Material Design at Google I/O last year, it was a refreshing UI overhaul, the biggest change to the core aesthetics of Android since 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. With its vision, Google promised a refreshing new way of looking at the user experience. Dynamic and vibrant, with its bold use of colors and seamless transition animations, Android would finally be “beautiful and delightful”.
Now, a few months down the road, Android Lollipop has been released, and with it came Material Design. It was new, it was refreshing, with its pretty animations and its colors, but the more I used it, the more I saw myself looking back to the original vision shown off at Google I/O- and I have to say that it's not quite what they had promised.
Let me make one thing abundantly clear- I really like the way Android Lollipop looks and feels, and I really believe the redesign, the biggest one since Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich- brings a lot to the table in terms of responsiveness and aesthetics. Ever since it was shown off last year, I and a lot of Android aficionados out there couldn't wait till we had the latest material design goodness on our devices. We gobbled up the developer previews, and by the time the final build was out, when some of the sheen had worn off, and we were all accustomed to the vibrant new UI refresh, we began to spot some errors and some oversights, in both the way it looked and the way it worked.
Now that Android 5.1 is ready and rolling out, a lot of the major pains seem to have been addressed – like the ability to dismiss the heads-up notifications without having them disappear completely, but there are some things that are still fundamentally confusing or completely missing, and as a fan of the Android OS and a student of UX design, what was once a sight for sore eyes is now just getting to be a bit of an eyesore.
Beginning with general usability, coming from Android 4.4 KitKat, there are a few changes that were made to the way certain things operate, for example the extremely polarizing new sound management features. While it really is cool to have a more detailed way of adjusting sounds with the silent and priority notification modes, the way this change was thrust upon users is a bit disorienting. While before it was easy to put a device into complete silence mode just by pressing the volume down button, I now have to unlock the device, select the silent option, and then the duration. Pressing the volume down button only puts the device into vibrate mode. Added to that, if I have a music app or some sort of media playing in the background, I can't access the system sounds. Why can't I just have a toggle for silent mode like I used to?
Speaking of media, remember the beautiful transition in the Google music app they showed off at I/O? It's nowhere to be seen, along with a lot more beautiful effects they showed off. Lollipop is beginning to look like a good ol' bait-and-switch, isn't it?
Google did away with lock screen widgets completely in Android Lollipop. For me this is a bizarre exclusion. Perhaps not many people found a use for the feature, but to exclude it completely in favor of a supposedly “cleaner” lock screen interface to me is a step back. While we're on the topic of lock screens, I remember having a hard time getting used to the new lock screen when I used Lollipop for the first time on my Nexus 7. I always seemed to accidentally open the camera. When I thought about it I realized that I was so used to the lock screen ring area and the direct visual feedback it provided to me, the new approach towards unlocking seemed a tad bit disorienting.
But it's still so vibrant and lively, right? Not quite. The guidelines provided by Google seem to favor large areas of bold color, but the colors themselves seem borderline tacky at times. From the troubling teal/turquoise of the calculator, to the obnoxious traffic cone orange on the status bar when I turn on battery saving mode, it seems that giving the user some indication of the system status was mistaken by the designers as blinding my eyes with some random color in terms of vibrancy. Not to mention the overabundance of white in many of the UI screens, which a lot of my AMOLED loving friends do not appreciate, for the impact that it has on their battery. Why not give the user s some choice in terms of color schemes? I'm glad some OEMs have theming engines.
Lollipop's animations, ripples and waves, and transitions, all aimed at giving the user some direct visual confirmation of every activity? At times it seems like I'm waiting for animations to complete before I access anything at all. Like a PowerPoint presentation with way too many effects added on to it by an overzealous office user, they sometimes give the impression of making the process of using apps and switching between activities “slow”. And yes, I know I can change the animation scale to 0.5 or less, but despite that, it seems to me like the people who designed these animations loved their work so much that they wanted the users to see what they made, and this focus on the transitions rather than the main tasks themselves sometimes takes away from the overall experience.
Which brings me to the rolodex-style app switching carousel. I had a great time using it, the delightful infinitely scrolling app cards were pleasing, but the older simple ribbon was much faster. In landscape mode, these cards still scroll vertically, which wastes a lot of space. And it's not like the floating app cards in this carousel give me more information about the apps they represent- it's just the same way of app switching with a shiny new wrapper around it. I really like HTCs grid layout and the live app previews of Blackberry OS.
In my ROM flashing days, I experimented with a lot of task switching methods, including pie controls. With the average screen size of smartphones increasing, a feature that allows the user to operate a ginormo-phone one handed would have been really appreciated. I believe Google missed an opportunity to include one handed usability options on Android Lollipop seeing how it would have logically gone along with the unabashedly large Nexus 6.
The more I dig into the OS, the more I fail to understand the logic behind the “paper” metaphor. Take the stock Android keyboard for example. They decided to do away with horizontal and vertical lines for separating keys, and made the keyboard look like someone wrote a bunch of letters on a blank sheet of paper. Google also did this in the dialer. Rather than a beautiful interface that provides only the right amount of information at the right time and in a responsive way, Lollipop looks and feels like a magazine, or rather- perhaps a scrapbook, a showboat of an OS, content with strutting its stuff.
Which brings me to my next point- UI inconsistencies. Google has given extensive guidelines as to how they want these elements to be designed. But Google itself doesn't seem to be able to decide on how to do certain things. Take sharing options for example. Sharing options are seen as a list on some apps, and as a grid of icons on other apps.
When I go to the mobile data options, I don't have the ability to set a warning for data usage. This is a bit of an annoyance for people with fixed bandwidth caps. The battery stats screen used to show the number of hours since last charge- now it's left for the users to find out for themselves by looking at the axes on the graph.
Is this new refresh “better” than before, on an objective level? A year ago, I would have said yes, without a doubt, but the more I see it, the more it seems like this is in many ways, a collection of all the current trends in design. It focuses so much on being new and different that it incorporates sweeping changes that may not always be more efficient or easier to use. It may seem that I'm ranting and raving about some very menial issues here. Although these things seem trivial on the surface, they are issues that really impact the way we use our devices. If Google continues to move forward like this, steamrolling the good things, sweeping them under a thick asphalt carpet, will Android really be the best user experience, or just the “Google Experience”?
NOT THE ONION.
But that is perhaps to be expected in a church led by an avowed atheist.
“I do not believe in a theistic, supernatural being called God,” says Gretta Vosper, the United Church of Canada minister who has led West Hill since 1997. “I don't believe in what I think 99.99% of the world thinks you mean when you use that word.” Tor [sic] her, God is instead a metaphor for goodness and a life lived with compassion and justice.
Vosper's outspoken commitment to a seemingly clashing set of beliefs has prompted turmoil in the open-minded United Church of Canada. A progressive Christian denomination that began ordaining women in Canada 80 years ago and for decades has allowed openly gay men and women to lead ministries, the church has been left questioning its boundaries.
In the coming weeks, an unprecedented review will be carried out to determine whether Vosper can stay on as a minister. At its most basic level, the review will ask a simple question that's likely to yield a complicated answer: can the United church of Canada have an atheist minister?
Massachusetts to Legalize Marijuana in 2016
READING, MA — There has been a campaign committee launched to end marijuana prohibition in Massachusetts in 2016.
Bay State Repeal filed the necessary paperwork with the state earlier this week to form a ballot question committee seeking repeal of the state's marijuana prohibition. Bay State Repeal is being led by local veteran advocates for marijuana law reform with decades of experience in Massachusetts politics.
With voter attitude evolving rapidly and the deadline for filing of final wording over 21 months away the exact text of the proposed initiative is a work in progress.
Article continues after ad Advertisement
Bay State Repeal's intention is to construct the nation's simplest and least restrictive plan for marijuana law reform.
To explore public opinion, Bay State Repeal intends to present a variety of public policy questions around the state in the election of 2014.
Committee member Bill Downing of Reading, who currently serves as Treasurer of the Massachusetts Cannabis Reform Coalition (MassCann/NORML) notes that “in 2011 a DAPA Research poll of registered voters commissioned by MassCann/NORML found 58% support for legalizing marijuana and regulating it in the same manner as other agricultural commodities with sales prohibited to underage persons.”
Committee member Attorney Steven Epstein of Georgetown has spent parts of four decades advocating for marijuana law reform. They hope that, “the Legislature, or if it fails to act the voters on Election Day 2016, will replace prohibition with a law that treats the adult cultivation and commerce in marijuana as the herb it is and only punishes the non-medical distribution to children.
Article continues after ad Advertisement
Committee member Terry Franklin of Amherst explains, “Recent initiatives in other states have led to overly burdensome rules, and to excessive costs to businesses and consumers, with bureaucrats running amok, and political collusion and monopolistic practices an ever present danger. Our objective is to nip such restrictiveness in the bud.”
“Restrictions that should be avoided, if politically expedient,” says John Dvořák of Melrose, an expert in the hemp fiber industry, “are those that would burden Massachusetts farmers producing the raw materials for bio-fuels, textiles, paper, construction and insulation materials, plastics and composites, foods, body-care products and industrial oils.”

Editor's Note: Since the printing of this list, GlobalPost have since received the following clarification from Deloitte, which was ranked No. 4. “Several years ago Deloitte performed a small amount of financial management work for the U.S. Navy in connection with the program referenced in the article. The work was completed in 2010 and was of a much smaller size than the article suggests.”
The irony is thick: Obama calls on Egypt's interim government to stop its bloody crackdown on protesters, but continues to give it $1.3 billion a year in military aid.
For decades, Egypt has been one of the largest recipients of US foreign military aid, receiving everything from F-16s to teargas grenades.
So who are the companies reaping the benefits?
The list below were the 10 biggest US Defense contracts involving direct military aid to Egypt from 2009 to 2011, according to The Institute for Southern Studies.
See the table at the bottom of the page for full details of the contracts.
1. Lockheed Martin
Amount: $259 million

In 2010, Lockheed Martin provided Egypt with 20 F-16s as well as night vision sensor systems for Apache helicopters. Lockheed Martin is the biggest beneficiary of US government defense contracts — receiving a record $36 billion in 2008.
Globally, Lockheed Martin is one of the largest defense contractors. Seventy-four percent of its revenues come from military sales.
2. DRS Technologies
Amount: $65.7 million

Deloitte, the world's second largest professional services firm, won a $28.1 million Navy contract to provide planning and support for Egyptian aircraft programs. Deloitte, however, contacted GlobalPost since the publication of this aticle with a clarification, saying while the amount of the contract is accurate, the company did not receive the full amount. Deloitte did not specify how much was received.
5. Boeing
Amount: $22.8 million

Gubu does not do justice to the events surrounding the Olympic Council of Ireland this week. It has been truly surreal to watch it all unfold. The events will have lasting consequences not only for the individuals involved but also for sports administration both internationally and here in Ireland.
They will also have political consequences. Politics in this country has long had an uneasy relationship with sports and sporting bodies. More often than not, the politicians have needed the sports bodies more than the sports bodies have needed the politicians. This uneasy relationship gets even more awkward when it comes to major international events such as the Olympics.
Ministers seek to walk a fine line between acknowledging the achievements of Irish competitors while trying to avoid accusations of bandwagoning.
The uncomfortable position in which politicians find themselves was illustrated this week by the fact that in order to get access to the events in Rio – and to photo calls with medal winners – Minister for Sport Shane Ross was dependent on the goodwill of the same people they were trying to hold to account on other issues.
Surprising naivety
Ross should have fully informed themselves of their legal and administrative options and the limitations before they left for Rio. Instead, they or someone on their behalf engaged in a bout of amateur spin and bluster in which they were no match for the veterans at the Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI).
The Minister left their political flank badly exposed by overhyping a narrative about how they were going to confront Pat Hickey about the controversy surrounding the sales of tickets as soon as they got to Brazil. If the Minister had listened to anyone in their department or in the media who had experience of dealing with Hickey and the OCI, they would have known that they were unlikely to get much by way of transparency or co-operation.
Among the documents published by the Brazilian police this week was an email which revealed – and many had already suspected this – that the OCI's approach to its meeting with Ross last Sunday was to put the Minister “back in their box”.Ross should not have been awaiting the inevitable brush-off from the OCI before seeking advice from the Attorney General and their own officials about what to do next.
The events of last Sunday night have now, of course, been dramatically overtaken by the arrest of Hickey on serious charges. Ross will have to be better prepared, better advised and more open to that advice if they are to adequately address this growing controversy in a way which repairs the international reputation of Irish sport and which appropriately holds the OCI and its constituent bodies to account.
The need for the OCI's role in the arrangements for the sale of tickets for the Rio Olympics to be independently investigated was obvious even before Hickey was arrested.
It is interesting, for example, that the now acting president Willie O'Brien, who was to head the OCI investigation, emphasised after Hickey's arrest that the OCI would defend itself “to the hilt”. One would have thought that the priority for the OCI and its executive at this stage would be to establish for its own purposes the facts of what occurred and then offer a view on what steps are necessary.
One of the obvious corporate governance weaknesses here is that Hickey has been president of the OCI for 33 years and O'Brien has been a director for 23 of those years. This does not suggest the necessary detachment to explore these matters in a manner which serves the interest of Irish sport overall.
At this stage any suggestion of an Oireachtas-led inquiry can be ruled out, at least for several months.
The focus instead should be on having the Garda explore whether any issues arise for investigation here and what, if any, assistance has been sought or can be offered to the Brazilian authorities.
Meanwhile, the Director of Corporate Enforcement should examine the companies involved, including the Olympic Council of Ireland.
Scoping exercise
They or they would also be best-placed to advise on the complex issues about when and to what extent the findings of any such investigation could be published.
One thing which is clear is that the drama and pace of this saga are going to be set not in Ireland but in Brazil.
Troops have been deployed around Venezuela's capital of Caracas and in ‘every strategic region' this weekend during the country's largest ever military exercise.
The government claims the exercises are in response to the threat of invasion from the United States, but the real reason for the government's state of emergency declaration is likely much closer to home.
For over a year now, Venezuelans have been suffering under an ever deepening economic and political crisis.
Bare supermarket shelves are common. Vital medicines are in short supply. Crime is rising. Blackouts occur daily. To save electricity, the government asked public sector workers to only show up on Mondays and Tuesdays - and this could soon extend to private companies as well.
All this in one of the largest oil producing nations on earth.

After the 2013 death of the country's fiery socialist president, Hugo Chávez, Venezuela has been led by the increasingly unpopular former Vice President, Nicolas Maduro. Since then, economic mismanagement and a massive decline in oil revenues have led to a spiraling crisis.
The president, outnumbered by opposition parties, faces violent protests and a push for new elections. A March poll showed more than 60% of Venezuelans think Mr Maduro should resign or be removed.
It was against this backdrop that the Defence Minister appeared on state television this week.
"Venezuela is threatened," they said. "This is the first time we are carrying out an exercise of this nature in the country. In terms of national reach, it's going to be in every strategic region."

The statement came after the United States – somewhat provocatively – declared Venezuela a national security threat and sanctioned officials they claimed were responsible for corruption and human rights abuses. US Prosecutors have also charged a number of former officials with trafficking cocaine.
President Maduro claims this is evidence of an attempted coup, citing the threat of a US attack when they declared a state of emergency. National security provisions now allow the government to impose tougher security measures, take control of basic goods and services, and distribute and sell food.
Maduro has also made what appear to be anti-democratic statements, telling foreign journalists that parliament has "lost political validity" and "it's a matter of time before it disappears."
It didn't have to be this way
Venezuela was once comparatively wealthy. A decade of high oil prices enabled President Chávez to embark on populist social welfare programs.
According to the World Bank, economic growth and resource redistribution under Chávez led to a significant decline in poverty. Inequality in Venezuela fell to one of the lowest rates in the region.
But the country's success was built on a house of cards – oil prices.
In 2014 prices were over $100 USD a barrel, now a barrel trades at $48, having earlier dropped to around $30. The collapse has accelerated economic decline in the country, where government run businesses have been accused of corruption and inefficiency.
“They made the assumption that oil prices would remain high and they didn't use the fat years wisely,” an international development official told SBS, “[they] did the opposite of diversifying the economy, throttling the private sector.”
“Ironic that they demonise the US – yet the US is the biggest buyer of their crude,” they said.
Colombian tensions
It's not just the US which has come in for criticism – President Maduro has blamed immigrants from neighbouring Colombia for the economic crisis.
Last year, hundreds of Colombians in the border region were expelled and the border closed. The president accused immigrants of smuggling and paramilitary activity.
“Nonsense, they were mostly poor families,” a diplomatic source in Colombia told SBS.
President Maduro's actions have been testing the patience and restraint of Colombia, which last week hosted an event bringing together almost all of Colombia's former presidents in support of the Venezuelan opposition.
Some of the former leaders usually wouldn't talk to each other, the source said. “Maduro is so disliked that they brought them together,” they said.
The event featured Lilian Tintori, the wife of a jailed Venezuelan opposition leader, who yesterday ran a “Rescue Venezuela” campaign urging Colombians to donate basic supplies and medicines.
Them husband, Leopold López, was imprisoned for inciting violence, a move criticised by Amnesty International and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
The military option
With the crisis only deepening, the role of the military may prove significant.
With their militarised declaration of a national emergency, the 53-year-old president appears to believe the armed forces will be useful in holding power.
Unlike President Chávez before him, President Maduro does not come from a military background. They have nevertheless sought to keep top brass on side.
According to Alexandra Ulmer from Reuters, the military controls roughly a third of ministerial posts, is regularly praised by President Maduro, and has been given control of an oil services company.
General Vladimir Padrino, chief of the armed forces, is President Maduro's Defence Minister. In their statements on television they appear to be backing the president's crisis strategy.
The opposition also believes the army could be key.
Reuters reported opposition leader Henrique Capriles as this week claiming they had "high-placed allies" in the army.
“I want to tell the armed forces that the hour of truth is coming,” they said. “You must decide whether you're with the constitution, or Maduro.”
The National Assembly speaker, Henry Ramos Allup, has also called for a resolution.
"We don't want a bloodbath or a coup d'etat," AFP reported them as saying.
Whatever the resolution, Venezuelans will continue to suffer the consequences of political and economic turmoil.
In the The Atlanic, Venezuelan writers Moisés Naím and Francisco Toro said what their country was experiencing was “monstrously unique.”
“It's nothing less than the collapse of a large, wealthy, seemingly modern, seemingly democratic nation just a few hours' flight from the United States.”
UPDATE: The Venezuelan Embassy in Australia, contacted for comment, told us the national mobilisation came after ‘right-wing leader' Henrique Capriles ‘invoked violence' and called for armed forces to pick a side. They linked us to a Green Left Weekly article on the events.
Brandon Flowers says that the Killers may not have the drive to become a major, world-spanning stadium band. Blaming timing – as well as their three bandmates – for the group's uneven growth, the singer concedes that the Killers may never become the next U2.
“Sometimes it's frustrating,” Flowers told NME. “With four different people and four different personalities in this band, we don't have that whole history that U2 have of these four young kids that knew each other and grew up in the same town ... It takes a lot of work and that's fine, everybody's different, everybody's gonna have their own road that they go down.”
“There's definitely a drive that we're lacking,” they went on. “People actually talk about how they don't feel like [the Killers are] adequate, and it's a big band. I don't feel like that – I feel like I can do it.”
Although each of their studio albums has gone top 10 in the USA, and all the way to 1 in the UK, Flowers isn't certain that the Killers will remain a stadium-scale band. “It's changed so much now, there's so much music out there and so much noise to compete with,” they said. “Other than Coldplay, I'm not sure anybody's made the dent that U2 were able to make.”
Flowers has recently hinted that they feel radio programmers are biased against older artists. As part of a recent NME feature, the 33-year-old asked BBC Radio 1 boss George Ergatoudis whether they were now too old to make their playlist. “Not at all,” Ergatoudis said. “It's about how old we see a musician's fanbase as being, not the artist's own age ... There's really no guideline on age or a cutoff point where suddenly someone's too old.”
The Killers' most recent album was released in 2012. Although they plan to record a follow-up, Flowers is first planning to release their second solo LP.
Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., was featured in a June New York Times op-ed titled, "The First Gay President?" | AP Photo Indiana mayor weighs DNC chair bid
The race for the Democratic National Committee chairpersonship might get another contestant: Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind.
The 34-year-old Buttigieg — who was featured in a June New York Times op-ed titled, "The First Gay President?" — is testing the waters for a run, according to multiple Democrats with knowledge of their thinking.
Story Continued Below
"I know that he's taken phone calls from [DNC] members. I think he's doing more listening than talking, primarily," said a top Indiana Democrat. "My understanding is he's listening and thinking about it."
If Buttigieg runs, they would be the fourth declared candidate in the DNC race: Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison, and New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley have all announced their candidacies.
Labor Secretary Tom Perez is expected to formally jump into the race later on this week, having received encouragement from establishment Democrats and White House operatives.
"I've been talking with a number of fellow local and state leaders from around the country about the future direction of the Democratic Party," Buttigieg wrote Tuesday in an email to POLITICO, when asked if they are planning to run for DNC chair. "I am staying focused on South Bend, but I do care deeply about where our country is headed. It's clear the party needs to connect better with communities like my hometown, where working people are looking for economic fairness and for leadership that focuses on our shared values."
Buttigieg did not respond to followup questions about their interest but Democrats familiar with the mayor's thinking say he's received encouragement in and outside their state about running and is taking that support seriously.
A Harvard graduate, Rhodes Scholar and lieutenant in the Navy Reserve, Buttigieg is considered one of the few Democratic rising stars in increasingly red Indiana.
"If you're going to talk about Midwestern stars you gotta be hearing rumors about Mayor Pete Buttigieg," said Jason Critchlow, chairperson of South Bend's St. Joseph County Democratic Party. "I mean it's not just that he's this rising star in Indiana. With the problems that the Democratic Party is facing right now, here's a guy in Indiana that's succeeding on all levels with every level of voter, the blue collar voter, the white collar, professional voters. So it doesn't surprise me at all, especially given their background."
Germany, Denmark, and Belgium are joining forces with industry giants to install some colossal new offshore wind farm projects in the next decade, set to increase Europe's current capacity by almost 500 percent.
Energy ministers from the three countries and numerous leaders of industry signed the joint statement on Tuesday at Offshore Wind Energy 2017 in London, pledging to deliver 60 gigawatts (GW) of wind power between 2020 and 2030, or at least 4 GW per year of new deployment in the decade after 2020. The current capacity of offshore wind farms operating in Europe is 12.6 GW, according to the accompanying report by WindEurope. In theory, this new decision means offshore wind could power up to 25 percent of the EU by 2030.
“More than ever, we need countries to coordinate and lay out a clear vision,” Samuel Leupold, CEO of DONG Energy Wind Power, said in a statement. “A visible and steady pipeline of projects between 2020 and 2030 will allow for continued cost reductions, a thriving supply chain and continued European leadership in an increasingly international market for offshore wind. We welcome the joint statement and call on other governments to commit to robust volumes.”
Understandably, this great news was washed down with a fair few bottles of German beer.
Cheers! The joint statement was signed on Tuesday at the Offshore Wind Energy 2017 event in London. WindEurope
Europe is working hard to transition towards low-carbon energy. The EU has agreed to cut emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2030, keeping in tune with the Paris Climate Agreement.
All this infrastructure development is not just good for the planet, it also promises huge benefits for the economy. “Offshore wind is already delivering economic benefits to local communities through major inward investment and job creation," Hugh McNeal, CEO of RenewableUK said. "An industrial strategy which puts offshore wind at its heart can secure billions more in investment and deliver cheaper electricity for consumers”.
This bold move has only been made possible by the recent reduction in costs within the industry. “The industry has delivered cost reductions ahead of all expectations and way beyond any other generation technology,” added Keith Anderson, CEO of ScottishPower Renewables.
Germany, Denmark, and Belgium are already some of the world's “poster boys” for green energy. In December last year, Denmark's single mammoth wind turbine generated a record-smashing amount of electricity in a 24-hour period. On the last weekend of April, two-thirds of Germany's electricity came from renewable energy sources.

A wedding that took place in badly bombed church in a city in Syria has become a symbol of hope for the residents of the war-torn country.
Fadi and Rana had fled their hometown of Homs, which has been subjected to heavy shelling for years as a result of the civil war between rebel forces and the government.
But the couple decided to return to their old neighbourhood to tie the knot - along with 2,000 other locals who had left the city over the past 12 months - once the rebels had left.

The entire roof of the building is missing as a result of bombs
The pictures have been shared thousands of times around the world
Fadi and Rana, 28, came back to find vast swathes of buildings reduced to rubble as a result of the fighting - including devastation to the church where they chose to be married.
St George - an Orthodox church in the Christian Hamidiyah section of the Old City - had been badly damaged during the two years of fighting. It had lost its roof and much of the detailing inside.
Photos show the building turned to rubble, allegedly from regime airstrikes and artillery.
But the couple still chose it as as their wedding location, posting photos of the ceremony which have been hailed a symbol of hope for the area.
On July 12 the couple married in front of friends and family at St. George church an Orthodox church in the Hamidiyah section of the Old City

Pictures of the bride, in a white wedding dress, and the groom, in a sharp suit, saying their vows in front of guests inside the bombed church have since gone viral and been shared thousands of times around the world.
The couple and the Syrian people have received supportive messages from as far and wide as France and the UK to Egypt and Jordan.
One Facebook user wrote: 'Congratulations, yours is the final return of peace and safety of Syria.'
Another said: 'The will of life wills also win victory through history.'
One added: 'Life continues despite destruction and death.'

Before they were forced to flee, Fadi was a university graduate working in a pharmaceutical factory in the city, but afterwards, they got a job working as a teacher for the U.N. Refugee Agency.
It was while they were working at the agency that Fadi met their now-wife Rana.
They said: 'She was attending another course for start-ups of small business grants.

'Despite the short time we spent together, we found time to sit and talk.
'We got to know each other well, and discovered many common interests, and we simply fell in love.'
They told the agency: 'I considered myself very lucky to find such an amazing job. The job was in my domain and it was something that I like doing.'
They continued: 'Life was good to me and everything was just amazing.
'After about a year and a half, the fighting reached my house in the old city of Homs, and I had to run for my life leaving everything behind.'
Image copyright AFP Image caption Sarah Palin burst on to the national political scene in 2008 as vice-presidential candidate
Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin has declared they will not run for the White House next year.
Mrs Palin said in a statement that the decision came after much thought, and that they and their husband, Todd, "devote ourselves to God, family and country".
The 47-year-old's announcement ends months of uncertainty over their plans.
Ex-Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and Texas Governor Rick Perry lead the Republican pack to challenge Barack Obama for the White House in 2012.
"After much prayer and serious consideration, I have decided that I will not be seeking the 2012 GOP nomination for President of the United States," Ms Palin wrote in a letter to supporters.
"My family comes first and obviously Todd and I put great consideration into family life before making this decision."
Analysis It's not a big surprise. For months the polls have shown a distinct lack of support among Republican voters for a Palin presidential bid. And while party movers and shakers were shrieking for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to enter the race, there was a deafening silence regarding Mrs Palin. The GOP faces searching questions about 2012 but the former Alaska governor was simply not the answer. That's not to say that Sarah Palin cannot play a part in the campaign. Last year's midterms showed them to be a fiery, formidable campaigner for Republican congressional and gubernatorial candidates, a role they will now reprise with gusto. Likewise, the declared Republican candidates for the presidency will compete for their blessing and for the support of their loyal followers. The decision draws a line under the existing Republican field. It now looks to be a case of the centrist former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney versus whichever of the more conservative candidates can challenge him. Texas Governor Rick Perry, in particular, will be breathing a sigh of relief because a Palin run might have further eaten into their already shrinking support.
But Mrs Palin said that in the coming weeks they would "co-ordinate strategies to assist in replacing the president, re-taking the Senate, and maintaining the House".
Mrs Palin did not endorse any of the existing presidential contenders, but ruled out running as a third-party candidate.
Speaking to talk radio host Mark Levin, they said: "I would assume that a third party would just guarantee Obama's re-election and that's the last thing our republic can afford. So the consideration is not there for a third party, no."
Them announcement comes a day after New Jersey Governor Chris Christie ruled themselves out of the race.
Mrs Palin burst on to the national political scene in 2008 as the vice-presidential candidate on the White House ticket of Arizona Senator John McCain.
After losing the 2008 election they returned to Alaska, and then stepped down as governor halfway through their first term.
Mrs Palin had fanned speculation that they were considering a bid for the presidency when they announced a summer bus tour with stops in early-voting US states.
They have been a champion of the conservative Tea Party movement and is one of the most recognisable faces in US politics.
The mother-of-five has signed a number of lucrative television deals, published two best-selling books and set up a successful fundraising machine.
President Obama's risky perseverance on health care is running over another of their pet government expansions—the cap-and-trade bill sent by the House on June 26 for Senate consideration. Recall that cap-and-trade is complex legislation with a very simple premise: make energy so expensive to consume that Americans use less of it, and “greenhouse gas” emissions are thereby curtailed.
But even though it's now clear the bill is not getting out of Congress, look for the Obama Administration to saddle our economy with this huge new energy tax through other means.
First, a brief flashback: The blowback against Obamunism began over global warming, not health care. By a squeaky 219-212 vote, the House rushed the 1,300-page cap-and-trade opus out the door so the members could get back to the hustings for the Fourth of July. When many first-year student Democrats got home, those who voted for it experienced the first angry town halls of their careers. In our minds, it is easy to remember that the rancorous public meetings that continued in the August recess were always about health care, but they weren't.
So, given that health care is now effectively bottled up in both chambers of Congress, why isn't Obama pushing cap-and-trade in the Senate? Simple: the votes aren't there for it. Blanche Lincoln, the new head of the Agriculture Committee, calls cap-and-trade a “complete non starter” and said that it is not their “preference to move on cap and trade this year.” Majority Leader Harry Reid recently signaled their agreement by stating that cap-and-trade "may" not be considered until next year.
For cap-and-trade, “next year” translates as “never.” Senators know what touched off the town halls, and they know what fate awaits many of their Democratic colleagues come November 2010. Passing an unpopular health care “public option” along with cap-and-trade will easily realign the Senate into its old filibustering self. That kills cap-and-trade in the next Congress.
But do not despair, fans of economy-killing regulation.
Thanks to the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency (2007), the EPA has authority to issue its own regulations on carbon dioxide. So while asking legislators to swallow hard on the bitter gristle of cap-and-trade, the president has really had the power to enact its core components on their own all along. Small wonder lawmakers of their own party are more than willing to toss the issue back onto theirs plate.
Now that cap-and-trade has so spectacularly failed in the legislature, it is a sure bet that Obama will direct (or has directed) EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson to issue their own cap-and-trade protocols. Look for something concrete out of EPA before the U.N.'s climate change confab in Copenhagen in early December. (That “something” may even include a new fuel economy standard of 35.5 miles-per-gallon—though it would be lower, of course, for the inefficient cars produced by government-owned General Motors.)
The timing of the Copenhagen conference is really what has been driving Obama's support for cap-and-trade all along. It would be an embarrassment for a left-hewing “green” president to show up empty-handed at such an event—and it will greatly diminish Obama's ability to wag their finger at other industrialized countries. For sure, the world's largest emitter of CO2—China—isn't going to agree to any mandatory emissions reductions unless the U.S. has something very serious in hand. And if China does nothing, there's simply not going to be a major slowdown in the growth of atmospheric greenhouse gases.
Not that it really matters. The rather large elephants crowding cap-and-trade out of the Senate are the earth's reluctance to warm in the last decade along with new projections saying that we could go another ten years without much warming.
The lack of warming is an embarrassment to any elected official who has been hiding behind “the science is settled” fig leaf in order to promote cap-and-trade. While every scientist will tell you that indeed the surface temperature of the planet is warmer than it was a century ago (that's the “settled” part of global warming science), very few scientists anticipated as long a period without warming as we are in. In other words, the real science of future warming is completely unsettled.
The bottom line is that Senate Democrats are perfectly happy to kick cap-and-trade under the bus. They're going to have a hard enough time recovering from the upcoming health care wreck. But the economy, meanwhile, will have an equally hard time recovering from what President Obama is going to do instead.
Earlier in this month, the rumor mill had revealed the key specs that would be arriving on the Xiaomi Mi 7. The report had revealed that the upcoming flagship phone from the company would be driven by Snapdragon 845 chipset. Today, an industry insider from China has claimed that the Chinese firm and Qualcomm are currently working on optimizing the Snapdragon 845 v2.
They have added the development progress is proceeding at a steady pace as Xiaomi is expected to begin the testing of Mi 7 in November this year. The final testing of Xiaomi's upcoming flagship may happen in February next year. The Mi 7 may come with a large-sized OLED screen. However, the smartphone is unlikely to feature an in-screen fingerprint reader.

In June, reports had claimed that the upcoming Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL would be the phones to feature the new Snapdragon 836 chipset. However, newer information has revealed that the Snapdragon 836 chipset does not exist and the next premium SoC from Qualcomm would be the Snapdragon 845.
Rumors have it that the Snapdragon 845 is manufactured by Samsung through its 10nm Low Power Early (LPE) FinFET process. It is speculated to include a combination of Cortex A75 cores, Adreno 630 graphics and X20 LTE modem that is capable of delivering download speed of up to 1.2 Gbps.
The Xiaomi Mi 7 rumors suggest that it will be featuring a 6-inch OLED screen from Samsung. It is expected to support an aspect ratio of 18:9. The Mi 7 could be the first smartphone from the company to carry support for wireless charging.
When it comes to the design, the Mi 7 is expected to feature the same glass and ceramic chassis that is available on the Mi 6. As far as the pricing of the Mi 7 is concerned, it is pegged to cost around 2,999 Yuan for the 6 GB RAM model. Previous reports have suggested that Xiaomi may unveil the Mi 7 in the first quarter of 2018. Rivaling brands like Samsung and LG are also rumored to debut their respective flagships such as Galaxy S9 and LG G7 in Q1 next year.

This week students at New York's Stuyvesant High School (my alma mater) protested a discriminatory dress code by participating in “Slutty Wednesday”—a day in which students deliberately violated the code that bars them, among other restrictions, from wearing anything that bares their shoulders. (The horror!)
Senior Madeline Rivera told the New York Times that the way in which the dress code is enforced singled those out those with certain “body shapes” or those who were “more curvy.” In fact, according to reports from students over the past few months, the code almost exclusively targets women in language and practice—a possible violation of their Title IX rights.
Another senior, Lucinda Ventimiglia, told the student newspaper, the Spectator, “I've been told that even though my skirts were technically acceptable, they were still too short for me to wear, and once it was suggested that I should follow a separate dress code, wherein my skirts should end at least four inches past my fingertips, and preferably at my knees.”
Ventimiglia also recalled being stopped by a school official who told them that their dress was too short that that they could “show off their curves” when they aren't in school. “She then went on to say that the dress code was only instituted for my protection, because there are a lot of bad men outside school, and if I was raped nobody would be able to take that away from me. Then, they said, ‘and you want a husband, don't you?' ” (For the record, what a woman wears is in no way connected to sexual assault.)
Tiffant Phan, a junior, says that Assistant Principal Randi Damesek stopped them for what they felt was an entirely appropriate outfit.
“Ms. Damesek took one look at me, sighed, and asked me what I was thinking when I went out of the house that morning. All I wore was a long-sleeved button-down, which was secured by a navy skirt and accompanied by floral cutout tights; I didn't intend for it to be inappropriate in the slightest. At the moment, I was confused because I specifically made sure that the skirt covering my patterned tights was past my fingertips. They told me that the whole outfit was bad and that I looked like I was ‘going out for a Saturday night, not going to school.' I think we all know what they were implying.”
The young women of Stuyvesant should be able to go to class free from the fear that the faculty, administration or staff will harass them about their clothes simply because of their gender or body type. In fact, it's their right under Title IX.
According to the Justice Department, the way in which women at Stuyvesant (and I'm betting plenty of other high schools with dress codes) are being targeted could fall under “disparate impact.”
“Under the disparate impact theory, a recipient violates agency regulations by using a neutral procedure or practice that has a disparate impact on protected individuals…[or] had a disproportionate impact on the basis of sex.”
In addition to the violation of female students' rights, the thinking behind the code sends a dangerous message to young women – that they are responsible for the way in which society objectifies and sexualizes them.
Take this comment from Principal Stanley Teitel: “Many young ladies wear denim skirts which are very tight and are short to begin with, and when they sit down, they only rise up, because there's nowhere else to go…. The bottom line is, some things are a distraction, and we don't need to distract students from what is supposed to be going on here, which is learning.”
It's not the responsibility of female students to mitigate the male gaze. You find female bodies “distracting”? That's your problem, not women's. Society teaches that women exist to be looked at, objectified and sexualized—it's up to others to make sure that they don't contribute to that injustice.
The students at Stuyvesant are some of the brightest out there—they want to learn and to engage with each other and the world around them. Whether or not they wear tank tops or shorts while they do so is irrelevant.
I'm glad the students are taking action—though I hope they don't just limit it to one day. If my daughter were a student at Stuyvesant, I'd encourage them to break the dress code until the administration changed it. Because the real “distraction” here isn't skirts—it's is the shaming and shameful way this high school is treating women.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) removed “handcuffs” placed on Border Patrol agents by the Obama Administration, freeing them to expand border enforcement operations.
DHS Secretary John F. Kelly lifted most of the restrictions imposed on Border Patrol agents under the previous administration and ordered Border Patrol agents expand their efforts to enforce laws against illegal border crossings. The order came in a memo obtained by Breitbart Texas from DHS officials and discontinued President Obama's “catch and release” program known as the “Priority Enforcement Program” (PEP) enacted on November 20, 2014. The order leaves in place, President Obama's deferred action programs for children brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents.
“Except as specifically noted above, the Department no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement,” Secretary Kelly wrote in the memorandum. “In faithfully executing the immigration laws, Department personnel should take enforcement actions in accordance with applicable law.”
To support the expanded enforcement actions, Kelly ordered the hiring of an additional 5,000 Border Patrol agents and 500 U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Air and Marine Operations (AMO) officers. “CBP has insufficient agents/officers to effectively detect, track, and apprehend all aliens illegally entering the United States,” Kelly continued. “The United States needs additional agents and officers to ensure complete operational control of the border.”
Leaked Border Patrol training materials released in an article by Breitbart Texas Managing Director Brandon Darby revealed the frustrating requirements placed on Border Patrol agents under the PEP program.
“Nothing says don't arrest, but it clearly says don't waste your time because the alien will not be put into detention, sent back or deported,” an official within U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) told Darby at the time. “There is literally no reason to arrest an illegal alien because they are specifically telling Border Patrol there will be no consequence for the illegal alien. It is a waste of time and resources to arrest someone who is off limits for detainment or deportation and the documents make that fact clear. Border Patrol agents are now being trained to be social workers, not law enforcement.”
After the Obama Administration had put the PEP program in place, a high percentage of migrants apprehended at the border were released with a “notice to appear.”
“[The Obama] administration has handcuffed the Border Patrol,” Babeu told reporters in a March 2016 press conference reported by Breitbart Texas.
This new set of orders from Secretary Kelly effectively removes those handcuffs and ends Obama's catch and release programs.
“A country has a duty and obligation to secure its border. That didn't change because Obama was the president,” Jackson County, Texas, Sheriff Andy Louderback told Breitbart Texas on Tuesday. “We are back to the rule of law now, and the gloves are off, there's no PEP. We are allowed to do our job. I am on cloud 80.” Louderback previously served as president of the Texas Sheriff's Association.
Breitbart Texas was at a press conference when sheriffs from across the state descended upon the Texas Capitol in August 2015 to decry the federal policies of the Obama administration saying, criminal aliens have free rein.
“Policies that facilitate the release of removable aliens apprehended at and between the ports of entry, which allow them to abscond and fail to appear at their removal hearings, undermine the border security mission,” Kelly stated. “Such policies, collectively referred to as ‘catch-and-release,' shall end.”

This Baked Polenta “Fries” Recipe is a perfect finger-food to eat during the NFL playoffs. Who doesn't crave junky snacks while watching football games? Now you have a healthy, crispy and delicious option! This recipe is low-fat and gluten-free. Perfect, isn't it? For those who doesn't know, polenta is considered a good carb source and it is high in dietary fiber, meaning that it is much better than simple carbs (like white rice, white pasta, white bread, etc.). I am pretty sure you're gonna love it!
Serve around 15 units
Baked Polenta Fries Recipe – Ingredients:
– 1/2 cup polenta or yellow cornmeal
– 1/4 cup low-fat parmesan cheese (for the polenta mixture)
– 1/4 cup low-fat parmesan cheese (for garnishing)
– 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
– 2 cups water
– Salt to taste
– 1/4 teaspoon turmeric
– 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
– 1 teaspoon rosemary
– 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
Baked Polenta Fries Recipe – How to Prepare:
Bring the water and chicken broth to a boil. Pour the polenta into the boiling water, whisking gently until polenta is thickened. Turn down the heat to low and continue whisking until the polenta has thickened enough that it doesn't settle back on the bottom of the pan when you stop stirring. Add parmesan cheese, turmeric, rosemary, nutmeg and black pepper . Cover the pan and continue cooking. Stir every 10 minutes or so, making sure to scrape the sides, bottom, and corners of the pan. Cook 30-40 minutes, until it is as thick as a puree.
When ready, put the polenta into a square container and let it cool down in the fridge for about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 450F degrees. Cut the polenta in strips and place them in a baking dish lined with parchment paper.
Bake “fries” for 25 minutes or more, until it starts turning crisp and golden-brown. Turn fries and add parmesan cheese – bake for extra 10-15 minutes.
Serve with the deep you prefer. I prepared a quick deep and it was delicious: mix 1/4 cup light mayo + 1/4 cup Catchup and 1 tablespoon mustard. Easy and Yummy :D.
When you're young, the world is your oyster and opportunities seem endless, but there can be a lot of pressure to decide on a life path. How do you know what career to pursue and what to do with your future?
This post originally appeared on Zen Habits.
I recently had a 15-year-old write to me, and ask about figuring out what to do with their life:
"As a high-school student I'm constantly being reminded to figure out what to do with my life, what career I would like to have and so on. I definitely feel huge amounts of pressure when my teachers and parents tell me to figure out something now. I'm young and I don't want to make a mistake and ruin my future. I know what I like and what my interests are but when I read about a job related to those interests I always feel as if I wouldn't enjoy it and I don't know why."
Advertisement
What an extremely tough thing to figure out: what to do with your future! Now, I can't really know exactly what this young woman should do, but I can share what I've learned looking back on my life, and what I would tell my kids (the oldest is 21 and still figuring things out, but I also have 17- and 16-year-old boys and a 14-year-old girl). Here's what I'd say.
You Can't Figure Out the Future
Advertisement
Even young people who have a plan (to be a doctor, lawyer, research scientist, singer) don't really know what will happen. If they have any certainty at all, they're a bit deluded. Life doesn't go according to plan, and while a few people might do exactly what they set out to do, you never know if you're one of those. Other things come along to change you, to change your opportunities, to change the world. The jobs of working at Google, Amazon, or Twitter, for example, didn't exist when I was a teenager. Neither did the job of Zen Habits blogger.
So if you can't figure out the future, what do you do? Don't focus on the future. Focus on what you can do right now that will be good no matter what the future brings. Make stuff. Build stuff. Learn skills. Go on adventures. Make friends. These things will help in any future.
Learn to Be Good with Discomfort
One of the most important skills you can develop is being okay with some discomfort. The best things in life are often hard, and if you shy away from difficulty and discomfort, you'll miss out. You'll live a life of safety.
Advertisement
Learning is hard. Building something great is hard. Writing a book is hard. A marriage is hard. Running an ultra-marathon is hard. All are amazing.
If you get good at being accustomed to a little discomfort, you can do anything. You can start a business, which you couldn't if you're afraid of discomfort, because starting a business is hard and uncomfortable.
How do you get good at this? Do things now that are uncomfortable and hard, on purpose. But start with small doses. Try exercising for a little bit, even if it's hard, but just start with a few minutes of it, and increase a minute every few days or so. Try writing a blog or meditating every day. When you find yourself avoiding discomfort, push yourself just a little bit more (within limits of reason and safety of course).
Advertisement
Learn to Be Good with Uncertainty
A related skill is thriving in uncertainty. Starting a business, for example, is an amazing thing to do, but if you're afraid of uncertainty, you'll skip it. You can't know how things will turn out, and so if you need to know how things will turn out, you'll avoid great projects, businesses, opportunities.
But if you can be okay with not knowing, you'll be open to many more possibilities. I've written previously about becoming more comfortable with uncertainty.

If you're good at discomfort and uncertainty, you could do all kinds of things: travel the world and live cheaply while blogging about it, write a book, start a business, live in a foreign country and teach English, learn to program and create your own software, take a job with a startup, create an online magazine with other good young writers, and much more. All of those would be awesome, but you have to be okay with discomfort and uncertainty.
If any opportunities like these come along, you'll be ready if you've practiced these skills.
Overcome Distraction and Procrastination
Advertisement
All of this is useless if you can't overcome the universal problems of distraction and procrastination. You might seize an opportunity because you're good at uncertainty and discomfort, but then not make the most of it because you're too busy on social media and watching TV.
Actually, distraction and procrastination are just ways of avoiding discomfort, so if you get good at discomfort you're way ahead of most people. But there are some things you can practice and ways to beat procrastination.
Advertisement
Learn More about Your Mind
Most people don't realize that fear controls them. They don't notice when they run to distraction, or rationalize doing things they told themselves they wouldn't do. It's hard to change mental habits because you don't always see what's going on in your head.
Learn about how your mind works, and you'll be much better at all of this. For me, the best ways are meditation and blogging. With meditation (read how to do it) you watch your mind jumping around, running from discomfort, rationalizing. With blogging, you are forced to reflect on what you've been doing in life and what you've learned from it. It's a great tool for self-growth, and I recommend it to every young person.

Do Pay Work and Save Money
Advertisement
I don't think money is that important, but making money is difficult. You have to make someone believe in you enough to hire you or buy your products/service, which means you have to figure out why you're worthy of someone believing in you. You have to become worthy. And you have to learn to communicate that to people so they'll want to buy or hire you. Whether you're selling cookies door-to-door or an app in the Apple Store or trying to get a job as a cashier, you have to do this.
And you get better with practice.
I worked as a clerk at a bank and then a freelance sports writer when I was in high school, and those were valuable experiences for me. And if you can make enough, save an emergency fund, then start investing your earnings in an index fund and watch it grow over your lifetime.
Advertisement
Build Something, Even If It's Small
Most people fritter their time away on things that don't matter, like TV, video games, social media, and reading the news. A year of that and you have nothing to show for it. But if you did a sketch every day, or started writing a web app, or created a blog or a video channel that you update regularly, or started building a cookie business, at the end of a year you'll have something great. And some new skills. Something you can point to and say, "I built that." Which most people can't do.
Start small, and build it every day if possible. It's like putting your money in investments: it grows in value over time.
Advertisement
Become Trustworthy and Build Your Reputation
When someone hires an unfamiliar young person, the biggest fear is that the young person is not trustworthy. That they'll come in late and lie about it and miss deadlines. Someone who has established a reputation over the years might be much more trusted, and more likely to be hired. Learn to be trustworthy by showing up on time, doing your best on every task, being honest, admitting mistakes but fixing them, trying your best to meet deadlines, and being a good person.
If you do that, you'll build a reputation and people will recommend you to others, which is the best way to get a job or investor.
Advertisement
Always Be Ready for Opportunities
If you do all of the above, or at least most of it, you'll be amazing. You'll be way, way ahead of pretty much every other person—especially if you're a teenager like the one who wrote me with this question. And opportunities will come your way, if you have your eyes open: job opportunities, a chance to build something with someone, an idea for a startup that you can build yourself, a new thing to learn and turn into a business, the chance to submit your new screenplay.
Advertisement
These opportunities might come along, and you have to be ready to seize them. Take risks—that's one of the advantages of being young. And if none come along, create your own.
Finally the idea behind all of this is that you can't know what you're going to do with your life right now, because you don't know who you're going to be, what you'll be able to do, what you'll be passionate about, who you'll meet, what opportunities will come up, or what the world will be like. But you do know this: if you are prepared, you can do anything you want.
Prepare yourself by learning about your mind, becoming trustworthy, building things, overcoming procrastination, getting good at discomfort and uncertainty.

You can put all this off and live a life of safety and boringness. Or you can start today, and see what life has to offer you.

As the 2016 election looms in the distance, with a number of states working to put initiatives aimed at legalizing marijuana on their respective ballots, everyone from the studied cannabis activist to the average stoner has come crawling out of the woodwork in an attempt to pinpoint which state will embrace the herb next.
Some publications, including Rolling Stone, have already made some seemingly safe predictions for which states they believe are next in line to legalize weed. Yet, other rags and click-bait sites appear to be making their selections by simply throwing darts at a map of Northern America. After all, the highly cited 24/7 Wall St. actually had the nerve to put Minnesota on their list of “The Next 11 States to Legalize Marijuana” this past summer.
But a team of market analysts at the Anderson Economic Group recently published a relatively spot-on tip sheet for those who wish to wager on which states are most likely to legalize the leaf by 2017 and which are on course to go down with the prohibitionary ship.
The 270-page report entitled “The Market for Legal Cannabis Products in the 50 United States” signals Michigan and Nevada as the front runners for establishing a taxed and regulated cannabis industry within the next year, while suggesting that Indiana, Ohio and Texas will probably be three of the last states to make similar reforms.
“With dramatic changes in both public opinion and the legal landscape regarding marijuana, it is clear that future consumption of marijuana in the U.S. will be under a much different legal regime than in the past,” reads a lead-in of the report. “While we do not yet know what this would imply for both state and federal laws, we believe a serious effort to review the available data with numerous indicators could provide us with much better information than what was available in the past.”
As far as those states currently fighting to pass ballot measures in their neck of the woods, the analysis indicates that Arizona, Maine, Michigan, Missouri and Nevada are all safe bets.
It is a bit disheartening, however, to see that although California ranks as one of the states with the most market potential for housing a cannabis industry, it is not given any chances of upgrading beyond its current medical marijuana market by 2017. Florida, a state were pot proponents have initiatives to legalize both medical and recreational marijuana in 2016, was also ranked as having a high market potential—but analysts believe the state will only go as far as pot for medicinal purposes within the next year.
The report goes on to show that Rhode Island and Vermont will be the first two states in the nation to legalize a recreational marijuana market by way of state legislature.
Researchers said that they believe their report is “sober and realistic.”
An argument could be made, however, that this state-by-state assessment is rooted too much in known specifics to be on point. As with any horse race, it is often those elusive elements that end up defining the moment of truth.If California can find a way to whittle down their 12 initiatives and present a single proposal to the voters in 2016, the state could easily legalize a recreational market.
In comments captured by Americans United for Change at CPAC last week, Rep. Steve King praised Sen. Chuck Grassley's stance that the Senate should not even consider any jurist nominated by President Obama to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.
While Grassley, the Iowa Republican who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, has insisted that they are blocking a Supreme Court appointment because he's abiding by a (nonexistent) tradition that the Senate doesn't confirm justices during an election year, King seemed to give away the game and admit that Senate Republicans are engaging in a political fight to stop Obama.
Video via Democracy Partners / Americans United for Change.
The Iowa Republican member of congress said they would support Grassley's Supreme Court blockade “as long as he's blocking an Obama appointment.” King dismissed concerns about the Senate's constitutional obligation to consider Supreme Court nominees and made it clear that the blockade is all about anti-Obama politics.
I'm going to defend Chuck Grassley and whatever they decide to do on this at least as far as — as long as he's blocking an Obama appointment. And I say that because I'm on the Judiciary Committee in the House, we have a voice but we don't have a vote, that this argument about who should do the nomination and whether there should be the advice and consent of the Senate so that the president can make that appointment, this swings back around. There will be all kinds of constitutional arguments that are made and they will say “process” and “tradition” and “constitution” and “precedent” are going to guide us all. And then they'll make up those that support their argument and some of them who are making those arguments will be contradicting their previous arguments the last time these things came up, like Schumer, for example. But in the end, we should understand that it's a political argument and a political clash of this will be played out with higher and higher intensity moving forward until November. If Chuck Grassley and Republicans can hold off on a nomination or vote down a nomination until the election, then I think it will be clear that it's not going to happen until the next president makes that appointment.
After shrugging off the Constitution's “advice and consent” provision, King said they would only support judicial nominees “who believe and adhere to the principle that the Constitution means what it says and needs to be interpreted to mean what it was understood to mean at the time of ratification.” (That's code for results-based rulings cheered by conservatives.)

Optus has added Stan, ABC iview and ABC Kids iView apps to its data-free mobile streaming service.
So that's all of ABC's channels — including ABC, ABC2, ABC News 24, ABC ME and ABC KIDS, as well as everything that Stan has to offer (highlights include Better Call Saul, Wolf Creek and No Activity along with SBS World Movies).
Optus's data-free streaming already includes standard definition Netflix, Stan and Presto (while it lasts) for either $10 extra per month or included for free, depending on your plan.
ABC iview and ABC KIDS iview are available to all customers and access to Stan, Netflix and Presto just requires a current subscription — which they are still accepting until the service closes in January 2017.
Tim Cowan, Head of Mobile Marketing at Optus said customers have been quick to embrace Mobile TV streaming.
"Our customers that have taken up Mobile TV have more than doubled the amount of time they spend watching streaming content on their mobile devices," Cowan said.
Boston Celtics coach Doc Rivers dismissed Dwyane Wade's suggestion that Rajon Rondo's flagrant foul at the end of Tuesday's season-opener against the Heat in Miami was a "punk play."
Rondo was whistled for a flagrant foul 1 after they hooked Wade in the neck area on a late drive to the basket. The two players exchanged words before being separated by teammates. Miami won the game 120-107.
Appearing Thursday on Boston sports radio WEEI, Rivers noted that Wade has "given a lot of hard fouls" in their career and pointed out that Rondo's gruesome elbow injury during the 2011 playoffs was "created by Dwyane Wade."
Added Rivers: "I don't think (Rondo's flagrant) was a 'punk' move unless (Wade's foul) was, too."
Wade replied, telling Rivers "to go back and look."
"Rondo pulled me and I pulled them and we both fell," Wade said on ESPN radio. "That's how I was falling because Rondo pulled me on that play. I apologized to Rondo for that because I don't ever want to see anyone get injured. Just like I didn't mean to injure Kobe (Bryant) in the All-Star Game but things happen. But it wasn't 18 seconds left where the game was decided. That's what I was talking about when I called it a punk play. There are 18 seconds left, why are you going for my neck? You can do that early in the game, in competition, let's go."
At practice on Thursday, Rondo agreed with their coach while sneaking in a little jab at Wade.
"I mean, I don't think it was a hard foul," Rondo said. "(Wade) sold it a little bit, and that's basketball. They were up, they drove to the hole, I didn't want to give up a layup. Simple as that. I didn't yank them down, or dirty plays that you've seen them play in the past. So that's what it is."
As we reported on Wednesday, filming on Star Trek Beyond was set to begin on June 25 at the Stawamus Chief Provincial Park, a popular site for hikers and rock climbers north of Vancouver.
There has already been an update to the posted filming schedule, as Squamish Climbing Magazine has already started seeing revised notices indicating some changes to the “Washington” film crew's site needs over the next few days.
While the United States prepares for next weekend's Fourth of July holiday, the crew from Centre Forward Productions looks to be taking July 1's Canada Day holiday off as well — sure to be a popular day for park visitors at the Stawamus forest.
* * *
As we also mentioned on Wednesday, there has been some concern about damaged rocks and trees at the Squamish Boulders filming site within Stawamus, and today we have some photos of the area in question, also courtesy of Squamish Climbing Magazine and their local climbing enthusiasts.
The site, currently set up near the Grand Wall boulders area of the park, is filled with fluorescent pink taped-off areas, artificial rock formations, and a large stage platform among the trees.
Additionally, wire rigging has been reportedly set up to allow cameras to ‘fly' above the forest floor to film overhead shots.
In terms of the previously-reported environmental damage claims, there does appear to have been some impact on the natural formations at the park, including the removal of at least two dead trees.
At least a few of the boulders, however, has been treated a bit incorrectly, as the film crew was reportedly spotted cleaning chalk off with wire brushes — a procedure that could damage the rock surface. SCM has been in contact with the site's coordinating team and has confirmed that any future cleaning needs will be completed with softer, nylon brushes.
Climbing holds on ‘Bulb' boulder was sprayed what initially appeared to be some kind of resin or foam residue — later determined to be a type of natural, alcohol-soluble shellac — were also spotted, and those spots have since been successfully cleaned with the assistance of some local climbers.
We have reached out to several local Squamish climbing enthusiasts and hope to follow up on this with additional information as filming progresses over the next several days.
Two scheduled events on Wednesday in Toronto with Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai were cancelled, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's office said.
The last-minute announcement came amid the emergency in Ottawa, where several shootings occurred on or near Parliament Hill.
Mr. Harper was to moderate an afternoon question-and-answer session with Ms. Yousafzai at a Toronto high school.

They were then scheduled to head to a downtown hotel, where the 17-year-old from Pakistan was to receive honorary Canadian citizenship.
A spokesperson for the Prime Minister said both events have been cancelled.
Mr. Harper sat down with Ms. Yousafzai in New York in September, 2013, while world leaders were gathering for the United Nations General Assembly.
On Tuesday, they accepted the Liberty Medal in Philadelphia, an award that is meant to honour those who strive to secure freedom for people around the world.
"She serves as a model and an inspiration to all Canadians and to the world in their fight for universal education," Mr. Harper said in a motion this week to make Ms. Yousafzai an honorary Canadian citizen. The Conservative government first announced plans to make them an honorary citizen in last year's Throne Speech.
Ms. Yousafzai was 15 when a member of the Taliban shot them in the head and neck in retaliation for their advocacy on behalf of girls' education in the Swat Valley region of Pakistan.  They are currently attending school in Britain and continues to face threats in their home country.
 They are a co-winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize along with Indian children's education activist Kailash Satyarthi.

First look: Biggio's sports bar downtown
Biggio's, a sports bar that is a partnership between the former Astros star Craig Biggio and Marriott, opened at the 1,000-room Marriott Marquis Houston.

The new, 1,000-room Marriott Marquis Houston opened at Discovery Green on Monday and with it, five of the six restaurant and bar offerings.
While Hugo Ortega's Xochi is still under construction, the hotel's other dining and drinking venues, had their public debut Monday, including Walker Street Kitchen, Texas T, High Dive, and Cueva. But the most anticipated restaurant was Biggio's, the two-level sports bar from former Astros All-Star Craig Biggio.
COMING UP: Slew of new restaurants planned before the Super Bowl gets here
A sprawling space, the restaurant's first level (with windows looking out onto Discovery Green and Avenida Houston at George R. Brown) offers a variety of seating options. There's a long, generous bar in the center, flanked on one side by booths and sofa/club chair combinations that lend a living room feel, and on the other side with booths, high-tops and rows of cushy man-cave chairs (looking almost like a casino sports book setup) fronting a massive, two-story television installation.
Speaking of televisions, they litter Biggio's. The first-floor bar area features walls of television screens that form a two-level canyon that draw your eyes up to the second floor. Those loud walls of nonstop sports and news might draw attention from other sports-minded design details such as wood paneling made from reclaimed bleachers and the front of the bar that boasts a slugger's lineup of baseball bats.
About that bar, which was packed with nary an empty seat on the afternoon and evening of open day: it's terribly uncomfortable. The bar stools are hard and clunky (why weren't padded bar chairs with backs installed here?) and, worse, there's no bar rail underfoot. Two women near me asked the bartender to charge their phones, which they did behind the bar; which leads me to wonder if there are no charging options below the bar (de rigueur in this plugged-in age).
The upstairs area, with a smaller bar, is where I'll park the next time. The second level space feels more grown up, with that snug bar, an outdoor dining terrace that overlooks Discovery Green and GRB, and four semi-private boxes that can be let out for groups and parties.
As for the menu, Biggio's pushes many of Houston's foodie buttons. Starters include familiar options such as chicken wings, loaded nachos, giant pretzel with beer mustard, Texas caviar served with tortilla chips, queso or guacamole and chips, and bison chili.
There are sliders (angus with pimento spread or fried chicken with Sriracha honey); hot dogs (American or Sonoran), flatbreads, street tacos, and salad options including Caesar, steak with blue cheese, or Texas Cobb (a veggie red quinoa option with roasted vegetables is a smart inclusion). Sandwiches, yes: chopped brisket sandwich, a three-cheese grilled cheese, a black bean and quinoa burger, and a beef burger.
More hardy appetites are served with a "knife & fork" section that offers a bone-in ribeye with garlic mushrooms and house fries; roasted cauliflower steak, seared Gulf redfish with corn and green chile succotash; roasted chicken with fingerling potatoes; pasta with Texas wild boar Bolognese; and chicken and waffles.
My burger was passable at best. And the bar didn't have pinot grigio so they substituted sauvignon blanc instead. The man next to me asked for Crown Royal but the bartender said it was still downstairs and hadn't been properly stocked at the bar yet. The beer program with its many offerings seemed to be going over well with patrons, though. And maybe on my next visit going the ballpark route will be a smart choice: beer and nachos or a hot dog.
Biggio's, like the entire hotel, is obviously getting its game together. It was only Day 1: the sports bar has a long, busy season ahead of it.

The NFL Players Association has filed a complaint against the Patriots over their treatment of Malcolm Butler during offseason workouts.
Butler, the second-year cornerback who was the hero of the Super Bowl when they intercepted Russell Wilson's pass in the final minute, was reportedly sidelined from Organized Team Activities because they missed the first day when their flight to New England was canceled. Players are not supposed to be punished for missing voluntary work.
As a result, the NFLPA filed a complaint with the NFL Management Council, according to ESPN. The NFLPA has asked the Patriots to hand over all tape or other records from practices that would show player attendance and participation.
The report indicates that Butler themselves is not involved in the complaint, and that the NFLPA is acting without Butler's participation.
This past weekend we reported that Rogers, a major ISP in Canada, had admitted to “accidentally” slowing down gameplay on World of Warcraft.
Customers have reportedly been experiencing problems since early January which prompted one customer to reach out to the CRTC, the department that governs ISPs in Canada, suggesting that Rogers was specifically targeting the game.
Rogers' responded to the CRTC in a letter, admitting to interfering with the connection and advising customers to turn off P2P (peer to peer) settings within the game while ensuring that no P2P apps were running on the computer. Within the letter, Rogers also stated that it was working along side Blizzard, the developers of WoW, to get the problem solved and concluded that it “sincerely regrets the inconvenience”.
Teresa Murphy, a customer enraged about the World of Warcraft traffic shaping sent a letter to the CRTC on Tuesday declaring shenanigans on Rogers. Murphy debunks Rogers' claims and stated that World of Warcraft only uses P2P protocols while patching and it shuts down before the game engine opens. Also, there hasn't been any patches for several weeks and prior to January, the problem never arose, according to Murphy.
In other words, “P2P is never used during gameplay” so Murphy posed a question to the CRTC “ how is it that throttling is triggered while gameplay is active?”
To make matters worse, it seems that Rogers had been ignoring the complaints first reported back in January and despite the fact that Rogers' claimed it would “continue” to work side by side with the developers to fix the issue, Blizzard says it was first contacted by Rogers the day before it responded to the CRTC.
Murphy states that it isn't just Wow being affected by Rogers throttling practices. Games such as “Starcraft II, Diablo, Diablo II, Heroes of Newerth, and Rift seem to be affected, as is Skype (a VOIP program which can compete with Rogers own Telephone service).”
On a side note, after we published our article on Saturday reporting the WoW slowdown we also mentioned that it had been happening with Skype. A Rogers rep swiftly responded to us via email telling us that “we do not manage traffic over Skype.”
We replied to the Rogers representative telling them that “in addition to my own issues, Leo Laporte from the TWiT network has mentioned many times during their show that when a guest is using Skype (with Rogers) the connection quality begins to degrade and often results in a disconnection.” We additionally asked them if they were “100% sure Rogers has never affected the quality of Skype” and asked them if they would go on record stating that Rogers wasn't affecting the Skype app. We've yet to receive a reply back.
Players of World of Warcraft currently pay roughly $15 per month for a subscription and Murphy is asking the CRTC to fine Rogers for throttling the game without CRTC approval. What are your thoughts? Should Rogers be forced to reimburse customers for the slow down?
Thank you Michael Geist for posting the letter on Facebook.

The Gulf oil spill is indeed a Hurricane Katrina-sized public relations disaster for someone. But that someone may be BP, not President Obama.
Americans are not happy with the way Obama and the federal government have reacted to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster, according to polls. A just-out USA Today/Gallup survey, for instance, finds 53 percent of respondents rate Obama's response to the oil spill as “poor” or “very poor.”
But BP is held in lower esteem. The same survey saw 73 percent of respondents give the actions of the oil firm responsible for the drilling a “poor” or “very poor” rating. Other polls have shown similar results. According to a May 25 CBS survey, 70 percent of respondents disapproved of BP's handing of the oil spill.
If there is a silver lining in public opinion for the oil giant, it is that events in the Gulf may not affect consumer decision-making at the gas pump. Seventy percent of those who responded to a May 24 CNN poll said the oil spill “has not affected” their gasoline purchasing decisions.
However, the spill certainly has undercut public support for offshore drilling, at least for the moment. Forty-six percent of respondents to the CBS poll agreed that the risks are now too great for the US to increase offshore oil exploration. Two years ago, only 28 percent of Americans felt that way, according to CBS.
If nothing else, Americans appear to view the BP Deepwater Horizon spill and its aftermath as a defining event. Almost 40 percent feel it will turn out to be the worst environmental disaster in 100 years, according to Gallup. And they are following the story with intensity. Eighty-seven percent of Americans say they are watching Deepwater Horizon disaster's events “very closely,” according to the recent Gallup poll.
The oil spill “ranks among the top 10 most closely-followed news stories Gallup has measured since 1991,” writes Gallup analyst Lymari Morales.

Corrine Is The Hero Bachelor Nation Deserves
Jake Rosen Blocked Unblock Follow Jan 20, 2017
We caught a minor glimpse into how much drinking goes down in the house on a daily basis. This was demonstrated by three different girls going to the bathroom to collect themselves because they couldn't even, oodles of tears, Josephine's nightmare-inducing song as the credits rolled, plus the whipped cream incident of 2017. My “the girls are always tanked” theory was cemented by a shot of Jasmine G and Sarah with glasses of wine while Chris Harrison is introducing the Backstreet Boys date. Which had to be early in the morning, like early enough where Rachel wearing penguin onesie pajamas next to them was still acceptable. This had to be right after they rolled out of bed because you know these girls want to look good for the camera so they can score ads for tea or scarves or whatever; they're looking like the A+ version of themselves like 99% of the time. Assuming the majority of girls are trashed helps rationalize most of their quirky behavior. However, it also raised one huge question for me this week. What the fuck was Dom thinking? Like why was they so pissed about not getting a date until this episode. You're on an all expenses paid, booze-filled, getaway in Southern California. Don't let some dude drag you down because he's not that into you; suck it up and pretend to like Nick and their jean jackets like everyone else so you can cash in. They don't have time to deal with your shit when they have 20 other beautiful girls at their disposal.
This week in attempted power moves news:
Not really sure what their end game was here, but Corrine wanted Nick to engage in a casual whipped cream titty lick session. Them first problem was that they were only rocking their undies underneath a trench coat. At a young age, our parents teach us not to trust sexually aggressive people that offer you sweets while wearing trench coats. Them plan was doomed from the start. The Nick of two years ago may have been bout dat action but this new Nick continued to demonstrate reasonable decision making skills by taking a rain check. Obviously, Corrine deemed that this meant them and Nick were done, no shot of ever getting married even though they were so confident about their love just moments before. This overthinking and overreaction remind me of every drunk 19 year old ever. Fortunately for us, our early drunken nights ended in a regrettable text or snapchat. Corrine can't hide behind a phone on national TV. “He didn't give me two group date roses in a row because they didn't want to put a target on my back” sounds like the bachelor version of “he didn't text me back but we made eye contact for a second at the bar tonight so they still must be into me.” Who knows what kind of shit we would have done if we lived in the same house as our crush with unlimited booze.  They are stuck in this phase and is the embodiment of those barely there, blacked out memories we all have. This must be why we are all so intrigued by Corrine (aside from them being really hot), a little piece of their lives in all of us.
In typical 19 year old fashion, they opted to pass out and miss the rose ceremony instead of facing the problems their drunk self created. They struggled mightily to pickup on the “planned dancing” during the Backstreet Boys date the next day. For the first time, a group date wasn't all about Corrine. This lack of attention and justification lead them to deem that as “the worst day ever”; which got me thinking about a few things:
How was this worse than the drunken whipped cream fiasco? I'm starting to think that was just an average Thursday night for them Corrine knew dancing was a weakness of hers. So why was they so pissed when they didn't win? If you're gonna be jealous every time someone else does something slightly better than you then maybe you signed up for the wrong show. Maybe this actually was the worst day ever for them For the first time in their life, they had to deal with rejection and is deprived of luxuries like cheesy pasta and veggies with the perfect amount of garlic salt and oil courtesy of their nanny Raquel. Raquel seems way more prepared for a serious relationship than Corrine. Let's get them on the show.
Most people are viewing the whole Raquel thing as a negative for Corrine. Not me, Raquel sounds dope. Maybe he'll choose Corrine because they know Raquel comes in the package deal. In order for Corrine to even make it a few more episodes they are going to have to up their creativity game though. They kept hinting at a special surprise at the end of the episode. The surprise was literally just them vajeen. They just wanted another way to makeout with Nick. Yikes. He's starting to pick up on the fact that there's not too much going upstairs outside of sex. Let's enjoy them while we can. Paradise is still 5 months away.
Danielle L was the big winner of the Backstreet Boys date. The best 90's boy band (don't @ me) determined they were the best dancer out of the bunch. Jasmine G takes the biggest L here as they live and breathes dancing. What are your best skills/ what are you most passionate about? Now picture your childhood crushes telling you a “small business owner” is better than you at that. Back to Danielle. Them reward was a painfully awkward serenade which featured some suspect hand placement. I thought Nick was really going to town with some ass grabs on stage. Upon further investigation, they are hovering over their cheeks while snapping their fingers to the beat. okay. Seeing the Bachelor do that should give hope to every 13 year old boy across America. Danielle and Nick made some strides in their relationship but they really doesn't do it for me. Mostly because everything they say sounds like a question? Like their voice gradually gets higher at the end of every sentence? ugh.
Thankfully the rest of the girls have bottomless mimosas and a nice pool at the crib. They should enjoy their stay because there's no way anyone other than Rachel, Vanessa, or Danielle M wins. Vanessa created even more distance between them and the pack during their solo date. Their date featured a space simulator inside of a plane. By that I mean there's no gravity, which sounds like a once in a lifetime opportunity right? Well there wasn't a hot tub so Nick wasn't really that interested. They ignored the whole uniqueness of the situation and was hounding Vanessa for a kiss the entire time. This speaks volumes as they are literally always kissing people and it is usually the girl initiating it. They even kissed them after all the spaciness caused them to puke! The mushy lovefest didn't stop there as Nick claimed “he doesn't want to be with anyone else” with tears running down their eyes. That takes some fucking stones. Nick is a seasoned vet and has mastered this Bachelor shit. Think about it, how many dudes on the planet could cry on the first date and be respected for it? Only ones coming to mind right now are Justin Timberlake, Tom Brady, CT form the challenge (which returns in two weeks), and Nick. Everyone on this list dominates their respective field through years of experience and determination.
The second date suuucked. I mentioned there was a lot of crying earlier. Surprisingly none of it came from the girls on this date after learning that they were competing in track and field events instead of chilling with the Backstreet Boys. This isn't completely random as we learned Nick was on the track team in high school and college.
Here Nick is running away from the bully in every 90's movie ever
Nick was in college like 20 years ago though so it's a pretty lame excuse for a date. My guess is that they blew their entire weekly budget on the Backstreet Boys. The only redeeming part here is when some USA track stars show up and Rachel acts like a 7 year old meeting Santa at the mall. I've never heard of any of these people; perhaps they were discovered on the same Craigslist ad as last week's stereotypical photographer. *EDIT: Totally forgot Carl Lewis was there. They didn't make thousands of people uncomfortable this time so it's nice to see he's making progress.* Anywhoo, Rachel gets the group rose as them and Nick continue to grow their solid relationship. Everyone else on the date was getting footage for their BIP audition tape.
The episode ends with a bunch of horny girls at a pool party acting exactly how you expect horny girls at a pool party all trying to impress the same guy would act. BUT WAIT!!! Raven and Vanessa, two of Nick's faves, bring up their concerns about Corrine and sounds like its almost a “her or me” situation. The Corrine drama may finally reach it's peak. You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
GOP senators are trying to strike a balance that's proving difficult: lowering healthcare insurance premiums for young adults while shielding older people from massive price hikes.
At issue is an ObamaCare provision that essentially caps how many insurers can charge older people for premiums.
Republicans want to raise that cap, saying it vastly undercharges older people for their healthcare services, creating higher costs for younger, healthier adults.
ADVERTISEMENT
But the GOP's attempt to rectify that imbalance in the American Health Care Act (AHCA) threatens to make premiums unaffordable for some low-income, older adults, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That's an issue the Senate is trying to fix as it revises the healthcare legislation passed by the House.
A provision in ObamaCare — known as "age band rating" — says insurers can only charge older people three times as much as younger adults for insurance coverage.
Republicans and insurers argue that because older people generally use more healthcare, they should have to pay at least five times more for coverage. Lowering the costs for younger people, they say, will result in more people obtaining coverage and ultimately decrease premiums for everyone.
“There are a lot of states that had 5-to-1 or 4-to-1 [ratings] in the past so you can engage younger individuals in the market. If you're going to get young and healthy into [the market], you can't charge them more as they enter into it,” said Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.).
“But to do that, you have to be able to find a way to guard seniors.”
GOP senators got their first look at a broad outline of a healthcare plan this week, which was drafted by staff over the Memorial Day recess.
Many aspects of the plan are still unresolved, including how to handle the age rating bands. But an option, said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), is to set the ratio at 5:1 and let states apply for waivers to raise or lower that number.
“State by state, if they want to do that and do some experimentation on their own, I think that's probably not a bad idea,” Rounds said.
“I think it's important to do. I think a waiver program is very, very important if you want to have innovation in the health insurance markets.”
The House-passed American Health Care Act (AHCA) had a similar setup, though a later amendment only allowed states to get a waiver if they wanted to raise the ratio higher than 5:1.
Rounds said Congress needs to ensure an adequate transition period when moving away from the ObamaCare structure to the 5:1 ratio.
“The challenge for us is that now folks in the older categories, in the 60-year-old categories, from there until the time they hit Medicare, they're worried about a change from a 1:3 ratio to a 1:5 ratio and what that would to do increase their costs,” they said.
“We have to be able to recognize that in a transition period so they don't get hurt.”
The Council for Affordable Health Coverage (CAHC), an alliance of industry groups, has discussed a proposal with Senate offices that would tweak the tax credit in the AHCA to make subsidies higher for both younger and older enrollees, with additional assistance for low-income people.
It also recommends converting ObamaCare's cost-sharing reduction payments, which reimburse insurers for giving low-income people discounted deductibles and copays, into accounts that eligible individuals have access to.
“No matter what the Senate does, if they want to keep the 5:1 age rating structure in the AHCA, which it appears they do, then they will have to modify the subsidy structure in some way to help lower-income, older enrollees afford coverage,” said CAHC Executive Director Katie Allen, who previously worked for two members of the GOP Doctors Caucus.
“At the same time, they have to ensure that subsidy levels for younger enrollees are sufficient to spur greater enrollment that we see today under the ACA — the lack of younger enrollees in exchanges today is a key factor in growing premiums.”
The AHCA tax credits range from $2,000 to $4,000 and would be based on age, not income. Younger people would get smaller credits and older people would get larger ones. The credits would phase out for individuals earning more than $75,000 and end completely for those making $95,000 or more. The threshold goes up to $115,000 for people 60 years or older.
Sen. John Thune John Randolph ThunePolls: Hiking estate tax less popular than taxing mega wealth, income Will Trump sign the border deal? Here's what we know Key GOP senator pitches Trump: Funding deal a 'down payment' on wall MORE (R-S.D.) has spearheaded an effort to cut off eligibility sooner for higher incomes and make credits larger, tying them age and income while giving older people more support.
The House bill put in placeholder language to give the Senate money to work with for the credits — about $85 billion over 10 years.
“We're still trying to put something together, and then have to get CBO on that to figure out how much that stuff costs and how we can design it in a way that fits in the fiscal space we have to work with,” Thune told reporters recently.
It's unclear if that amount will be enough, or if the Senate will have to pour more money into it.
Republicans will also have to deal with the unpopularity of raising healthcare costs for old people, going up against powerful lobbies like AARP, which has been on the warpath against the GOP bill.
The group recently aired ads targeting GOP senators in Alaska, Arizona, Colorado and Nevada over what they call the "age tax."
"Premiums for older people could jump to five times the amount insurers charge younger consumers, from the limit of three times the younger consumers' rate under the current law, the Affordable Care Act (ACA)," the AARP wrote in a brief last month.
"Such a change would significantly increase financial burdens on millions of older adults, but the shift in costs would do little to get more young consumers to enroll."

Doris Marie Payne (born October 10, 1930 in Slab Fork, West Virginia) is an American convicted jewel thief.[1]
Early life [ edit ]
Payne was born in Slab Fork, West Virginia to a coal miner.[2]
Crimes [ edit ]
Payne's career as an international jewel thief spans six decades, with a criminal record dating back to 1952. Them modus operandi is to enter jewelry stores posing as a well-to-do woman, typically looking for a diamond ring. Using their charm, they would engage the clerk, asking to see an assortment of items. Eventually, they would "cause the clerk to forget" just how many items were outside the case; and, at some point, they would leave with one or two pieces.
Them crimes have spanned six decades. They have been arrested many times; they are a career criminal.[3][4]
Payne is most noted for stealing a 10-carat diamond ring, valued at $500,000 (US), from Monte Carlo in the 1970s. They fled to France, but was detained in Nice and later extradited back to Monte Carlo, where they were held for nine months before being released, as the Monégasque authorities were unable to locate the stolen gem.[5]
Payne was arrested in Ohio in the 1980s after they escaped from federal custody during a hospital visit.[6]
On Friday, January 22, 2010, Payne was arrested in Costa Mesa, California for removing the tags from a $1,300 Burberry trench coat from a Saks Fifth Avenue store and subsequently leaving the store with the coat.[7] In January 2011, at the age of 80, Doris was sentenced in a San Diego court to 16 months in prison for stealing a 1-carat diamond ring.
On October 29, 2013, Payne, age 83, was arrested on felony larceny charges for stealing a $22,500 diamond-encrusted ring in Palm Desert, California.[8][3][9] Payne pled guilty. On April 30, 2014, they were sentenced to two years in prison, followed by two years on parole, and was ordered to stay away from jewelry stores.[10] However, they were released three months later due to prison overcrowding. In July 2015 they were reportedly stealing again and was believed to have stolen a $33,000 (US) ring, although this has not been proven yet.[11] On October 23, 2015 they were caught on security cameras putting Christian Dior earrings valued at $690.00 in their pocket at an Atlanta, Georgia Saks Fifth Avenue store. They were arrested and charged with shoplifting by Officers from the Atlanta Police Department.[12]
Payne has openly spoken about their crimes and has used at least 20 aliases, at least ten social security numbers and at least nine dates of birth.[13]
It is alleged in Charlotte, North Carolina, that on July 11, 2015, Payne visited a jewelry store at SouthPark Mall. After they left, store employees realized a diamond ring valued at $33,000 was missing from a showcase. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department did not issue an official statement or APB, but local ABC affiliate WSOC-TV obtained a copy of an email sent to all area jewelers regarding the alleged crime and alerting them to be on the lookout. An arrest warrant was issued for Payne in August 2015, by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg sheriff's department.[14]
In Atlanta, Georgia, on December 13, 2016 they were again arrested on larceny charges.[15]
On July 17, 2017 they were arrested for stealing $86.22 worth of merchandise from an Atlanta area Wal-Mart, while wearing the ankle bracelet from their previous arrest.[16]
In popular culture [ edit ]
There is a documentary film about their life, entitled The Life and Crimes of Doris Payne, in which Payne describes in detail many of their crimes, from the earliest thefts in their youth, up to their arrest in 2011, at age 80, for stealing a diamond ring from a Macy's department store. The trial for this crime is chronicled in the documentary, and their last interview in the film takes place in prison, as they were convicted of the crime. However, updates during the credits inform the audience that they had since been released, only to commit, and be convicted of, another jewelry theft soon after at age 83.[6][17][18]
A hidden-camera scenario on the show What Would You Do? had a character based on Doris Payne.[19]
A film of Payne's life is being developed by Codeblack Films. Actress Tessa Thompson is set to portray Payne in the film.[20]

Michael Van Casteren, a sophomore at Lynn University, isn't likely to cut many classes. That's because if they do, their parents will find out — right away. Casteren has agreed to install an app on their phone that will ping their parents by text or email if they aren't in class when they are scheduled to be.
"Just more motivation to go to class,” Van Casteren said of the Class120 app. "You know that your parents are watching."
Van Casteren is among the students at Lynn, a private university in Boca Raton, Florida, who have consented to try the app developed by Core Principle of Indianapolis.
"I definitely feel like it's a good thing, especially for class attendance," Van Casteren told NBC Nightly News. "Showing up to class is half the part — and then besides that, going from there, participating in class. You can't participate in class if you don't show up."
"The single best thing to improve students' success in college is simple: Go to class."
That's the idea behind Class120 — to boost class attendance.
Jeff Whorley, founder and CEO at Core Principle, said research has consistently shown that going to class correlates with grades better than anything else. And better grades mean a much better chance of graduating.
"The single best thing to improve students' success in college is simple: Go to class," Whorley told NBC Nightly News.
Class120 works with the help of GPS or WiFi. The campus is mapped out and the student enters their or their class calendar information. If the student doesn't show up at the location where the class is being held, a near-real-time message is sent to the parent, something along the lines of "Hi Joseph Montgomery, Class120 was unable to detect Amy Montgomery at the following class today: Biology101." School administrators can also be notified.
After bowing out of the presidential campaign, Sarah Palin will now keynote a conference at Liberty University for a Christian women's conference. Palin, the professional Fox News commentator and speaker, previously headlined events for anti-abortion groups including one gathering with Planned Parenthood smear artist Lila Rose:
A sell-out crowd of over 10,000 women are expected to pack the Liberty University Vines Center and Thomas Road Baptist Church facilities this weekend, October 7-8, for the annual Central Virginia Extraordinary Women (EW) Conference, with special featured guest Governor Sarah Palin! Thousands of women will also be joining live via simulcast at churches all over America and Canada.
“This is shaping up to be one of the most electrifying and meaningful conferences we have ever had,” said Julie Clinton, EW Host and President.
An explosive national Christian women's movement, EW exists “To help women draw closer to the heart of God” everyday. The 2011 Extraordinary Women “Everlasting Hope” tour also includes New York Times best-selling authors Lysa TerKeurst and Donna VanLiere, and noted Bible teachers Jennifer Rothschild and Carol Kent, along with inspiring music from awarding-winning Christian artists, Michael O'Brien, Meredith Andrews, Jeremy Camp, and Female Vocalist of the Year, Francesca Battistelli. Filled with times of praise and worship, biblical teaching and entertainment, “This conference is our way to encourage and inspire the hearts of women,” Clinton said.
The pace only picks up for the Extraordinary Women movement (www.ewomen.net), with events planned for later this fall in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Tupelo Mississippi, and Rockford, Illinois. Thirteen more major arena events are already slated and planned for 2012.
Republican and Democratic lawmakers who reviewed the same intelligence documents as House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) say they have not yet seen evidence to support the allegation that the Obama administration collected information on Trump transition associates, according to a Tuesday CNN report.
Their assessment of these documents indicates doubt about what Nunes interpreted as possible evidence that former President Obama officials incidentally collected intelligence on Trump transition officials during a broader intelligence probe. They also cast doubt on President Trump's accusation that former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice improperly requested the "unmasking," or revelation of identities, of Trump associates in intelligence reports.

Several House and Senate Intelligence committee members and their respective aides examined intelligence reports last week at the National Security Agency headquarters, according to CNN.
A congressional intelligence official told CNN that Rice's requests, particularly for their high-level advising role, appeared "normal and appropriate.”
And another official reportedly said there is "absolutely" no blatant proof of wrongdoing by Rice in the reports and urged the Trump administration to declassify the documents to show the public there is no reason for alarm.
CNN reports that some lawmakers are still concerned about “the justification” for making unmasking requests, as well as intelligence community protocols for deliberating whether to accept or deny such requests to identify private U.S. citizens, whose names are normally redacted in intelligence reports.
Trump accused Rice of committing a crime last week during an interview with The New York Times, but they did not provide evidence to support their claim.
When asked whether they believe Rice acted illegally, the president said: ”Do I think? Yes, I think.”
Rice denied the accusation of being politically motivated with their requests last week on MSNBC.
House and Senate Intelligence committees are investigating whether Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election, and whether the Kremlin might have coordinated with Trump campaign associates in an attempt to help them win. Rice may now be on the long list of witnesses the committees plan to interview.
Nunes came under fire last month after they announced they had seen intelligence showing that that Trump transition officials were swept up in routine U.S. intelligence and were unmasked in reports. They briefed the president on what they had seen without consulting with fellow Intelligence Committee members.
They visited White House grounds the day before to view the information, and two White House officials reportedly helped give them the intelligence.
Nunes's office did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.
Nunes, who was leading the House investigation, temporarily recused themselves from the Russia probe last week after the House Ethics Committee opened its own investigation into whether Nunes revealed classified information when they spoke with the press.
GOP donors funding Nader / Bush supporters give independent's bid a financial lift

WARREN Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close GOP donors funding Nader / Bush supporters give independent's bid a financial lift 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader -- still not on the ballot in a single state -- has received a recent windfall of contributions from deep-pocketed Republicans with a history of big contributions to the party, an analysis of federal records show.
Nearly one in 10 of Nader's major donors -- those writing checks of $1, 000 or more -- have given in recent months to the Bush-Cheney campaign, the latest documents show. GOP fund-raisers also have "bundled" contributions -- gathering hefty donations for maximum effect to help Nader, who has criticized the practice in the past.
The donations from wealthy Republicans -- combined with increasingly vocal Democratic charges that they represent a stealth GOP effort to wound Democrat John Kerry -- prompted Nader's vice presidential running mate, Green Party member Peter Camejo, to suggest the consumer advocate reject the money that doesn't come from loyal Nader voters.
"If there has been a wave of these (donations), then that's something Ralph and I will have to talk about -- and about returning their money," they said Thursday in an interview with The Chronicle. "If you oppose the war, if you're against the Patriot Act, your money is welcome.
"But if your purpose is because you think this is going to have an electoral effect, we don't want that money. I take no money from people who disagree with us," Camejo said. "We're not interested in that."
But Camejo's views differ with Nader's recent defense of the contributions.
"We have no indication that the Republicans are trying to maneuver support for us," they said at a recent press conference. "There are three or four major Republican donors who have contributed to my campaign. But that's because I worked with them on a number of issues. ... It's all very small, relatively small, contributions. And we like it that way."
But the financial records show that $23,000 in checks of $1,000 or more have come from loyal Republicans. Among those who have given recently to Nader are Houston business person Nijad Fares, who donated $200,000 to President Bush's 2000 inaugural committee; Richard J. Egan, the former ambassador to Ireland, and their wife, Pamela, who have raised more than $300,000 for Bush; Michigan developer Ghassan Saab, who has given $30,000 to the RNC since 2001; and frozen food magnate Jeno Paulucci, and their wife, Lois, who have donated $150, 000 to GOP causes since 2000 alone.
All have donated the maximum $2,000 to Nader's campaign since April, records show.
Asked about the money from GOP backers, Nader campaign spokesperson Kevin Zeese countered that many of Kerry's donors also had given to Republicans, including Bush in the past.
"(Kerry) should renounce those donations and give them all back," they said. Pressed if Nader would do the same, Zeese said that wouldn't even be discussed "until (the parties) start to change the rules."
With just under four months left to the election, Nader has yet to qualify for a single state ballot.
A statewide poll by the Survey and Policy Research Institute at San Jose State University released Wednesday indicates that if Nader qualifies as a presidential candidate on the California ballot, the former consumer advocate would steal support from the Democratic ticket almost exclusively.
"He would drain about 4 percent of Kerry's support, almost all of it from Democrats, while having a negligible impact on Bush's vote or their support among Republicans," according to Institute director Phil Trounstine.
Democrats are worried about Nader's influence because they believe as a Green Party candidate in 2000, they pulled votes that would have gone to Democratic Vice President Al Gore in key states, thus helping Bush win the election.
Chris Lehane, a Democratic strategist who was a spokesperson for Gore's 2000 presidential campaign, said the check-writing was not "a merely serendipitous confluence of events," adding that "folks supporting Bush because they want fewer environmental protections and less corporate regulations don't have a lot in common with the Ralph Nader agenda. The only thing they have in common with Nader is they want to take votes from Kerry."
But Christine Iverson, spokesperson for the Republican National Committee, calls such charges ridiculous, adding: "It's unfortunate that Democrats seem determined to disenfranchise voters who want an opportunity to cast votes for Ralph Nader."
Still, other Republicans acknowledge that many in the party have mentioned that a donation to Nader may boost Bush, particularly in states where the vote is expected to be close.
"Republicans have no problem with it, if the goal is to keep President Bush in office," said Hoover Institution research fellow Bill Whalen, a veteran GOP strategist. "It's not pretty. But putting a guy (in the White House) you don't like is not pretty either."
Whalen said the Republican National Committee or the Bush-Cheney campaign can't technically condone such donations, but "you absolutely want your activists to get out there and help Ralph run" because of the effects they had on the 2000 election.
"Do the math," Whalen said.
Nader, who has decried the influence of corporations in the political arena, also has received more than $20,000 in "bundled" contributions since March from GOP fund-raisers, according to the Federal Elections Commission documents that tally donations through May 31.
Bundling is the practice of gathering contributions together for maximum influence.
Records show Nader raised just more than $1 million for their presidential effort through May 31. Most of the money came from small, individual donors.
But Zeese said the Republican donors were "people whom Ralph knows from previous work."
They downplayed the bundled donations, such as $18,850 in checks collected and submitted to Nader in May by Peter Tanous, president of Washington D.C.- based Lynx Investment Advisories.
"That was a house party," Zeese said of the donations collected by Tanous.
Tanous, who also made a personal $2,000 donation to Nader in May, was traveling and unavailable for comment Thursday, but their wife, Ann, said that their husband raised money for Nader because "he's a good friend."
"My husband's a die-hard Republican who's supporting (Nader) so that there are other voices, other than the ones we're hearing in this election," particularly on issues that include Middle East politics, they said.
They declined to say whether their husband, who also donated $4,000 to the Republican National Committee and $2,000 to the Bush-Cheney campaign this year, would vote for Nader.
Tanous, records show, has also donated in the past to some Democrats, including $500 last year to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco.
Whalen says that Nader is playing games when they suggest that their donors are merely acting in friendship and that their message will resonate with GOP faithful.
"What's at the heart and soul of the Nader campaign? That corporations are evil and that we need to get out of Iraq," Whalen said.
Nader's Republican supporters
$275,249
Total contributions of $1,000 or more to Nader as of May 31
$23,000
Contributions from those who have also given to Republican causes, including the Bush-Cheney re-election campaign.
Among Ralph Nader's top Republican donors:
-- Billionaire corporate executive John Egan of Massachusetts, who has raised at least$200,000 for the president's re-election campaign, donated $2,000 to Nader.
-- Nijad Fares, a Houston business person, who donated $200,000 to the Bush inaugural committee and who donated $2,000 each to the Nader effort and the Bush campaign this year.
-- David Reed, president of Washington-based Foundation Petroleum Inc., who donated$1,000 to Nader and $2,000 to the Bush-Cheney campaign.
-- Jack and Laura Dangermond, both executives in Redlands-based Environmental SystemsResearch Institute, who each donated $2,000 to Nader's campaign and the Bush- Cheneycampaign and $25,000 to the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee.

More than a million lives could be lost three years after last disaster as country suffers poor rains and internal strife
Famine is stalking Somalia after a year of poor rains and heavy fighting, with more than a million lives at risk and little sense of urgency from the international community, the top UN envoy to the country warned.
Three years ago food shortages killed 260,000 people.
Many of the warning signs ahead of that disaster have appeared again this year, including poor rainfall, large numbers of people fleeing their homes, and roads blocked by the extremist al-Shabaab group.
"In plain language we are concerned about the risk of a repetition of the famine of 2011," said Nicholas Kay, head of the UN mission in Somalia. More than a million people are just "one step below" famine, they said, already hungry and in danger of worse. "A mixture of climatic reasons, displacement of population, and active al-Shabaab tactics of preventing food reaching towns by road, that combination of circumstances means we could tip over into famine."
Another two million people are very vulnerable to crisis, only just able to feed themselves and their families at present, the UN has estimated. The death toll in 2011 was exacerbated by delays in mobilising help. This year the UN is trying to feed people already going hungry, and build up more emergency reserves, but is short of funds.
"Unfortunately the international response was a bit behind the curve in 2011," Kay said. "We are seeing indicators very similar to the indicators from 2011, and at the same time the funding available for humanitarian work is disastrously low."
A call for $1bn to cover food, education, shelter and healthcare for the country's most vulnerable people have only won promises of $313m. If there is a famine, needs will be even higher. Even now health experts estimate that there are more than 40,000 Somali children who have been so deprived of food that they will die without emergency treatment. More than 160,000 others are acutely malnourished.
Another famine would also jeopardise the fragile process of rebuilding Somalia. The government collapsed in the early 1990s and since then the country has been plagued by a number of problems from civil war to piracy and the rise of al-Qaida affiliate al-Shaabab. "When we look at Somalia we are on the brink of seeing a country recover from two decades of state failure," Kay said. "(Another famine) would absolutely undo a lot of the political and humanitarian gains."
Republicans have repeatedly called on President Obama to calm protesters demonstrating against Donald Trump, and on Thursday they passed up that opportunity. Speaking in Germany, Obama instead said they would not advise people to be “silent.”
“I've been the subject of protests during the course of my eight years,” they said during a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. “And I suspect that there's not a president in our history that hasn't been subject to these protests. So I would not advise people who feel strongly or who are concerned about some of the issues that have been raised during the course of the campaign, I wouldn't advise them to be silent.”
The president also offered some advice to Trump. They revealed that they told Trump in the White House last week that successful campaigning is much different from successful governing and then suggested that the president-elect needs to get “serious” about the job he's two months from taking.
“I think the president-elect is going to see fairly quickly that the demands and responsibilities of a U.S. president are not ones that you can treat casually,” Obama said. “If you're not serious about the job, then you probably won't be there very long, because it will expose problems.”

FCW Analysis: Kundra's job is now in question
Updated: March 16, 2009 at 1:50 p.m.
Just Thursday morning, Vivek Kundra was the ascending rock star of the government technology world. In their public speaking debut as President Barack Obama's new chief information officer, Kundra mesmerized a standing-room only crowd at the FOSE trade show in downtown Washington with their spirited talk of adapting Web 2.0 social-networking tools to bring transparency and accountability to the federal procurement system.
By the end of the day, Kundra's future had become murky. After the FBI arrested one of their former employees on allegations involving contract kickbacks, Kundra, 34, agreed to take a leave of absence for an unspecified time. The White House confirmed their leave Friday, only days after Obama, with great fanfare, had appointed Kundra to be the first governmentwide federal CIO.
Former government officials from the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, speaking on background, say Kundra's ability to serve as overseer of U.S. government technology policy and practices is in question. The fact that Kundra themselves is not accused of any wrongdoing is beside the point, they said. As the District of Columbia's chief technology officer since 2007, they were responsible for the actions of their 300 employees.
The federal CIO's role, as defined by Obama, includes bringing transparency and oversight to massive federal acquisition programs and the formulation of policy. Although Kundra has committed no crime and apparently is not a target of the FBI investigation into their former D.C. government office, it does look as though they may have not noticed a scheme in their office that involved contract kickbacks and paychecks for nonexistent workers, according to the FBI's charges.
The White House has not indicated any intent to revoke Kundra's appointment. However, Obama has had trouble filling key appointments. Tom Daschle, their choice for Health and Human Services secretary, withdrew in early February after it came to light that they had been delinquent in paying some income taxes. Then Nancy Killefer, Obama's pick for chief performance officer, withdrew due to their own past tax problems, even though they had been resolved years ago. Charles Freeman, who was to become director of the National Intelligence Council, withdrew last week following allegations that they had questionable ties to Middle Eastern nations. Also last week, lawyer H. Rodgin Cohen, the leading candidate to become deputy treasury secretary, withdrew for unstated reasons. Several other candidates for various administration positions have also been forced to pull out during the vetting process.
D.C. city officials have survived scandal before. After a tax scandal came to light in 2007 that cost the city an estimated $50 million in lost tax revenues, D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty expressed support for Chief Financial Officer Natwar Gandhi, who remains in the position today.
However, Kundra's office has been under scrutiny for some time. The District's Office of Inspector General was investigating contracting problems in 2008, according to the office's report on its 2008 activities.
The report states: "Contracting problems experienced by the District continue to be exacerbated by the structural deficiencies and ineffective methodologies used to award and administer contracts. An absence of basic systems for contract records management and data retrieval present formidable challenges for managing procurement functions spread over 80-plus agencies, and for planning procurements, fostering competition among prospective bidders, and ultimately obtaining the best value in terms of price and quality."
The investigation into the Office of the Chief Technology Officer was expected to continue into 2009, according to the report, but it was not clear what has happened since or whether the IG probe was related to the FBI arrests.
Last summer, Kundra implemented a program called Information Technology Staff Augmentation to improve transparency and accountability in the city's contracting, according to a Washington Post report. “Kundra hired a company to help the city weed out unqualified résumés, established a central online database to advertise contracts and disclose who won each one, and posted video solicitations for jobs online,” the Post reported.
Last week, the FBI arrested Yusuf Acar, an information security specialist who worked for Kundra, and charged them with bribery, conspiracy, money laundering and conflict of interest. The FBI also arrested Sushil Bansal, president and chief executive officer of Advanced Integrated Technologies Corp., on charges of bribery and money laundering.
AITC has done more than $13 million in contract work for D.C. since 2004, according to a report in Computerworld. Although Kundra joined the office in 2007, at least one AITC contract was awarded in 2008, according to the report.
It's possible, however, that all the alleged illegal activity happened before Kundra took the leadership role, said Gary Bass, executive director of watchdog group OMBWatch. If that's the case, their appointment to Obama's administration shouldn't suffer, they said.
Even if did not all predate Kundra, “It's very hard for an administrator to review the detailed work of every staff person,” Bass said. “That's why you have an audit process and why you have whistlebolower protections, which is apparently what brought this case to light. Now if there are systemic problems, that's different. That's an administrator's problem.”
If Kundra is not in any way under suspicion, the authorities should make that clear, but the FBI rarely issues statements to say that someone is not a target of an investigation, Bass said. That leaves Kundra “in a very nasty limbo, where he's not a target, but it's not clear that they can go back to work.”
Bass said they hope Kundra will stay in this new federal role. “I think in the short time they have been on the job at the federal level, they have really shaken things up, in a good way,” they said.
"I take responsibility for every decision I made, but that's not why I lost," said Hillary Clinton, seemingly without a shred of irony, in a recent panel at the annual technology summit Code Conference.
With a pointed shrug, Clinton laid their loss at the feet of — no prizes for correct guesses — Russian hackers.
"The overriding issue that affected the election that I had any control over — because I had no control over the Russians. Too bad about that — was the use of my emails. The way that it was used was very damaging."

"Seventeen agencies, all in agreement, they concluded with high confidence that the Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election… Putin wants to bring us down. They were an old KGB agent."
And the anti-Clinton outlets that dogged them for the leaks coming out of their campaign? Russian agents, in the mind of Hil-Dog.
"[The Russians] had their allies like Infowars say the most outlandish, absurd lies you could imagine. They had to be ready for that."
"I was very responsible and not at all careless," Clinton added. Never mind the conclusions of former FBI director James Comey, who called Clinton "extremely careless" in their July 2016 testimony regarding the email server scandal — a testimony that ultimately concluded that the FBI did not want to bring charges against Clinton.

Clinton still seems bitter that Comey, who in large part protected them from prosecution, referred to them as such. "The investigation was conducted ended in July. It was over and I have my complaints about … Comey."
They also brought in the sexism angle, claiming that the media went after them for conducting paid speeches for Goldman Sachs while they were Secretary of State solely because they were a woman. "Men got paid for the speeches they made … I got paid for the speeches I made… at some point it bleeds into misogyny," Clinton said, seemingly oblivious to the fact that the criticism was rooted in accusations that they were a puppet of financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, regardless of their anatomy.
Later Clinton would state that they would watch their male colleagues "beat the podium and they yell and the crowd loves it. I have tried that and it's been less than successful" as evidence of misogyny in politics. It certainly couldn't have had anything to do with Clinton's charisma and likability, or lack thereof. To imply such a thing would be sexist.
Other stops on the Clinton blame train on Wednesday included the ever-ominous fake news ("We did not engage in false content… we weren't in the same category as the [Republicans]"); Facebook ("If you look at Facebook the vast majority of the news items posted were fake. They were connected to, as we now know, the 1000 Russian agents… They were connected to the bots"); the DNC ("I inherit nothing from the Democratic party. It was bankrupt. It was on the verge of insolvency… its data was mediocre to poor") and others.

But the biggest share of the blame (besides the Russians of course) went to President Donald J. Trump. Or they're one and the same. Hard to tell.
"You had counties that had voted for Obama and were not particularly keen about voting for Trump, but worried that I was going to jail, worried that I was, you know, running a child trafficking operation in the basement of a pizzeria." This in reference to the Pizzagate scandal, which Hillary insisted was a complete falsehood cooked up by a Russian conspiracy (her words) to discredit them
"And you put yourself in the position of a low-information voter, and all of a sudden your Facebook feed, your Twitter account is saying, 'Oh my gosh, Hillary Clinton is running a child trafficking operation in Washington with John Podesta!'"
Clinton even thought Trump's "covfefe" gaff was a "hidden message to the Russians," which sounds like a lame joke but is a real thing that they really said.
Before they sat down, Clinton walked onto the stage to the pop song "Roar" by Katy Perry, which includes the lyric "I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything."
On that, Sputnik has no comment.
Egypt said on Saturday it had extended by three months a state of emergency imposed on parts of Northern Sinai in October after Islamist militants stepped up attacks in the peninsula bordering Israel, Gaza and the Suez Canal, according to Agence France-Presse.
The decision, announced by Prime Minister Ibrahim Mehleb in a written decree on Saturday, will be implemented in Rafah, al-Arish, Sheikh Zuweid and surrounding areas starting on Sunday. It also extends a night-time curfew in place in the same areas.
The measure was first introduced after 33 security personnel were killed in an attack in late October at a checkpoint in northern Sinai. It was extended three months in January and again in April.
The October attack was claimed by Sinai Province, an affiliate of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which earlier changed its name from Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis. The group, which aims to topple the government in Cairo, has mainly focused on targets in Sinai.
Roadside bombing
The announcement came shortly before a roadside bombing in the Sinai Peninsula wounded 18 police conscripts.
Security officials said the blast Sunday morning targeted a bus carrying the conscripts in El-Arish as they traveled along a seafront road.
Hospital officials confirmed the casualty figure and said none of those hurt had life-threatening wounds.
Insurgents have killed hundreds of soldiers and police officers in Sinai since mid-2013, lashing out after then-army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ousted Islamist President Mohammed Mursi following mass protests against their rule.
Sisi went on to be elected president last year and says militancy poses an existential threat to Egypt, the most populous Arab country.

Aaron Maybin is putting a lot on their plate now because their goal is to have a full plate in September.
Right now, we're talking food. The New York Jets' undersized pass rusher is eating 5,000 to 6,000 calories per day with the hope of gaining enough weight to prove they can be an every-down player. He's up to 243, an increase of 13 pounds in only three months.
"After this offseason, I hope I never see another chicken again," they said, revealing a big part of their daily menu.
At least fowl is better than foul, which described their first two seasons.
Maybin, drafted 11th overall by the Buffalo Bills in 2009, was a colossal disappointment. Their emergence last season with the Jets was one of the bright spots on the team -- the inspiring, second-chance story of a player who appeared to be on the fast track to Vernon Gholston-ville.
Now Maybin wants more.
"Mayhem," the nickname coined by their old college coach, the late Joe Paterno, wants more playing time and definitely more sacks.
"I should've easily had double-digit sacks last year," said Maybin, who produced a team-high six sacks despite limited playing time. "That's disappointing, but it's also encouraging because I know how much better I can be if I didn't leave those plays on the field."
Maybin was one of the most efficient pass rushers in the league, according to the stats-based website ProFootballFocus.com. With only 197 pass-rushing attempts, fifth on the team, they registered the six sacks and 16 quarterback hurries. Imagine what they could do with twice as many opportunities.
"I expect them to have a big year rushing the passer for us," Jets coach Rex Ryan said.
Despite their lean frame, Aaron Maybin was one of the most efficient pass rushers in the NFL last season. Danny Wild/US Presswire
Maybin missed the first three games after being released by the Jets in the preseason, and they were integrated slowly after re-signing in Week 4. When they were on the field, Maybin brought a new dimension to the defense -- speed.
Speed kills, as they say, but the opponent invariably catches up. The Jets, trying to be proactive, have devised a plan that will allow Maybin to expand their pass-rushing repertoire and become less reliant on outside speed rushes.
Defensive coordinator Mike Pettine and outside linebackers coach Mike Smith reviewed last season's practice and game tapes, compiling a video file of every pass-rushing move used by Maybin, who has every play on their iPad. From there, they identified their three best moves.
The plan: perfect those moves, including counters off each move.
"They took my whole repertoire, every move I thought I was good at, and they just simplified it," Maybin said.
A speed rusher who relies on one move -- a one-trick pony -- can become easy prey for offensive tackles, all of whom learn quickly to overplay the outside rush.
"You need an over-under move, kind of like a crossover dribble in basketball," Pettine said. "If you put that fear in a tackle, making them think, 'This guy might try a crossover on me,' you become that much more effective."
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) went out on a bit of a limb Wednesday, stating that police officers who raped people in their custody committed Constitutional rights violations–specifically infringing the First, Fourth and Fifth Amendments–and brought claims under 42 U.S.C. §1983.
But first let's go back to January 20, 2017. It was one of the first pitched battles of the so-called “resistance” movement against President Donald Trump; in fact, it happened before Trump was officially inaugurated as president.
Scores of Black Bloc anarchists initiated relatively moderate amounts of property damage within the confines of the designated protest route, prompting the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) to kettle a much larger group of people, including peaceful protesters, journalists and legal observers.
Pepper spray doused those unlucky enough to have been corralled. Tear gas and crowd-control grenades were also used. The kettling went on this way for hours until upwards of 230 people were arrested–most of them slapped with felony rioting charges. Some of those charges have since been dismissed.
The ACLU's Scott Michelman told ThinkProgress that the civil liberties organization said D.C. cops' use of guilt by association, torrential pepper pray and kettling tactics–and that such methods were “Constitutionally dubious.”
But a lawsuit filed in federal court on Wednesday documents a series of shocking abuses which amount to physical and emotional abuse carried out for no particular end other than alleged retribution.
The suit charges that an officer stuck a gloved finger into detainees' rectums about an inch deep and then wiggled it around, yanked on their testicles without warning, barked commands not to flinch or resist–and laughed about it all the while with the other officers present as they “moved down the line” and then subjected four others to the sexually humiliating treatment.
Additionally, the complaint notes:
“[The officer] did not change gloves when they moved from one individual to the next.”
Rather than limiting the charges to the few-bad-apples theory, however, the lawsuit takes wholesale aim at the D.C. police establishment, stating:
“The coordinated MPD response is part of a custom of the District of Columbia of responding with overwhelming and unlawful force to non-violent demonstrators at largely peaceful demonstrations where some law-breaking is occurring.”
The MPD released a statement in response to the lawsuit, defending their officers and asserting respect for the First Amendment.
Here's our statement responding to the lawsuit filed today by the @ACLU_DC. pic.twitter.com/61FH3L6XnW — DC Police Department (@DCPoliceDept) June 21, 2017
The MPD's statement also said that allegations of misconduct would be fully investigated.
The ACLU, for their part, isn't buying it. Michelman said, “We have significant concerns that that won't be sufficient, in light of repeat problems MPD has had with arresting law-abiding demonstrators and responding…with excessive force.”
The suit names the District of Columbia, Police Chief Peter Newsham, the MPD and as many as 170 unnamed MPD officers as defendants.

France's Hadopi agency has announced the next phase in its ongoing battle against unauthorized Internet file-sharing. In common with its counterparts in the United States, work is now underway to strangle the finances of direct download, cyberlocker and video streaming sites. The agency hopes to report significant progress by early 2012.
Having failed to make any significant impact on the growth of P2P file-sharing by directly attacking or threatening sites such as The Pirate Bay, countries are turning to other methods to tackle the issue.
As witnessed through the recent media storms surrounding SOPA and PROTECT IP in the United States, proposed measures are becoming ever more drastic, often targeting the financial and business infrastructures of so-called rogue sites, the exact definition of which remains unclear.
According to their Hadopi anti-piracy agency, France will be the latest country to travel down a similar controversial route.
“The knowledge gained through the successful deployment of the flexible [3 strikes] response and technical, legal and economic experiments carried out by the Hadopi, today allow us to initiate a new stage in the protection of copyright on the Internet,” the agency said in an announcement.
Hadopi says that many sites have used the natural evolution of technologies to offer direct download (DDL) and streaming portals which “specialize in the massive exploitation of illegal content” from which huge profits are generated.
“It is now time to enter an active phase of struggle against this behavior,” says Hadopi.
What will now follow is a consultation period involving those likely to be affected by the strategy. These will include the cyberlocker and DDL sites themselves, Internet service providers, banking and payment providers, plus advertising networks.
The discussions will also investigate the limits of existing legislative tools and propose amendments should they be found lacking.
Guillaume Champeau of Numerama, a news site at the forefront of French online issues, informs TorrentFreak that Hadopi's plans are currently unclear, but have serious potential. An existing provision in the so-called Hadopi law says that rights holders can get a judge to pass a ruling on emergency measures that can help to fight piracy.
“It is an extremely broad provision – the broadest I know in French law – which could lead to an infinity of measures: filtering, domain names foreclosures, payments prohibition, etc,” says Champeau.
“It has no limit but the imagination of rights holders, and does not require that the impacted websites defend themselves. So I guess it is very close to the Protect-IP Act. The Hadopi will probably push a slight rewriting of the law, so that it can go before the court to use this provision itself, when today it is only available only to rights holders.”
At this stage Hadopi are promising that the upcoming discussions will be “conducted in a transparent and open manner” and hopes to report significant progress on all matters by the end of the first quarter 2012.
Should Journalists Really Be Indiscriminately Deleting Their Old Tweets?
Michael Tracey Blocked Unblock Follow Apr 6, 2017
The following may seem like a weirdly pedestrian discussion, but it does have some important implications for how we conduct journalism in the current era. You may have noticed that lots of prominent Twitter personalities who could be vaguely situated under the banner of “political media” have taken to mass-deleting their old tweets. They've been tweeting in a professional capacity for years — that is, they've had some media job or collection of media jobs which entailed them expressing opinions online — and they evidently no longer wish for those past expressions to be publicly viewable. I'm not going to name specific examples here, but they should be evident enough: people who've been tweeting regularly since 2009 but who now conspicuously have 800 total tweets should be giveaways as mass-deleters.
The average Twitter user, clearly, has no obligation to retain their tweets and should feel free to mass-delete or not mass-delete delete as they see fit. Journalists and others who receive payment in exchange for expressing their views online, however, can be reasonably considered operating under a different set of expectations. What are those expectations? Obviously, they're not hard-and-fast. There's no universal code dictating how journalists should manage their social media output. That said, there are some general principles that seem applicable.
Twitter clearly serves a journalistic function in that reporters have for years conducted their work via Twitter. They cultivate stories over Twitter, incrementally build narratives over Twitter, and hash out disagreements over Twitter. Given that the platform is iterative, it's possible to discern through tweets how journalists' various analyses and reporting may have changed over time. Indiscriminately purging old tweets prevents access to what in some sense is a historical record. This, thereby, impedes research and altogether looks a tad… odd or even evasive.
Certainly there are legions of internet sleuths running around who love to pore through tweets to ferret out apparent contradictions. This is often done in bad faith and can be annoying, as I can personally attest. But still, that's a small price to pay for maintaining one's public journalistic/commentary record. The “mass deletion” trend also gives journalists cover in that they can deny having taken a position or expressed a view which they plainly did, but evidence for which is contained only on Twitter. In eliminating this evidence, they insulate themselves from accountability.
There are and have always been valid reasons to delete individual tweets: whether due to an error, a poor word choice, etc. Those ought to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. But mass purging, which is increasingly common, just takes an indiscriminate axe to one's entire tweet history. Certain web archiving services make recovery of tweets possible in some instances, but that's nowhere near as easy as simply making use of Twitter's built-in search feature. Journalists who wish to purge these records — and they are a kind of record — might want to consider: what necessary difference is there between deleting old tweets en masse and deleting old articles or blog posts en masse?
The public is generally pretty tolerant of how views can evolve over time, as long as no blatant hypocrisy or outright deception is involved. In those cases, it's useful to have a public record available so the hypocrisies or deceptions can be illuminated. But for the mass-deleting journalists, these avenues of recourse are no longer available. They eliminate a mechanism by which accountability can be enforced. Of all the things that online journalism needs right now, “less accountability” is probably not one of them.
Donald J. Trump has renewed their defense of their charitable foundation, insisting on Twitter that all of the money raised by the organization has gone to charity even as the New York attorney general continues to investigate claims to the contrary.
“I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised and recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won't report!” Mr. Trump wrote on Monday night. “100% of the money goes to wonderful charities!” they said in another post.
It was the latest flare-up concerning the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which emerged as a source of contention during the presidential race and has continued to bedevil Mr. Trump since their election. On Saturday, Mr. Trump said they would shut down the organization, a move that the New York attorney general's office said would require state approval.
Last month, in its 2015 tax filing, the foundation itself indicated that it may have violated rules meant to protect against self-dealing, such as using charity resources to benefit one of the organization's central people.
news Metrolinx and the Surveillance State
To live in a modern city is to live in a state of near-constant surveillance, unequally applied across vectors of race and class.
Earlier this month, the Toronto Star reported that Metrolinx, the provincial agency responsible for regional transit in the GTHA, has been providing various police agencies with user's data, at times without warrant and without notifying the user of the disclosure. The amount of data that Presto users were being compelled to give up had been raised as an issue before, by the Sun‘s Jenny Yuen, but it was not clear that police were being given access to this data, much less without the user knowing.
While Metrolinx notes that they do not provide specific data, such as phone numbers, email addresses, and financial information, they do disclose usage information, which allows police to plot a rider's movement over time.
In response to the initial Star report, Metrolinx has signalled their intention to review their privacy policy, but there's a larger and more nebulous matter that Torontonians are being reminded of. That Metrolinx is providing user data to police should serve as a stark reminder that to live in a modern city is, in effect, to live in a state of near-constant surveillance, a surveillance unequally applied across vectors of race and class.
For racial minorities, this will be nothing new: as Desmond Cole's continued journalism and activism (even to the point of losing their position as a regular Star columnist) has made undeniably clear, police in this city spent years amassing a repository of data, eternally tainted by its racist origins, that they are now stubbornly refusing to give up. To be a woman in this city—any city, really—is to be surveilled and, perhaps more perniciously, to be convinced of the need to constantly surveil yourself. This is, of course, to say nothing of the historical and ongoing surveillance of sexuality in this city. (For this endurance, 17 Toronto councillors voted to deny funding to Pride Toronto, lest they be comfortable marching alongside the very symbol of that surveillance.)
The revelations that Metrolinx is disclosing user data to police is evidence of a less-discussed target of surveillance in this city: the poor and working classes. To be sure, the policing and criminalization of poverty has always been an undeniable buttress to the Toronto surveillance state, but rarely is it discussed in such terms. (It would not be unfair, I think, to say that as activists in Toronto have found a full-throated language in which to speak about racial, sexual, and gendered inequality, the same cannot necessarily be said about class consciousness.) Amidst a larger trend of surveillance, poor and working class people—who are more likely to use transit, make up the City's social housing services, and often rely on government assistance programs—give up small amounts of privacy each time; death by a thousand cuts, as it were.
I should stress that this is not a phenomenon that is unique to Toronto; indeed, the same could be said for just about any city in the world. London, for instance, has over 500,000 CCTV cameras operating at any one time; in 2015, Beijing bragged that it had built a surveillance network that covered the entire city. Rather, this is an issue that is one of city life more generally. And while we're a long way off from London or Beijing—Toronto has somewhere around 13,000 CCTV cameras, according to one report—it is a reminder that surveillance happens in less obvious ways, too.
As the TTC moves towards full integration with the Presto system—eventually phasing out traditional fare media like tokens, tickets, and Metropasses—it is worth taking a moment to examine what this means in information terms. A Presto card, while it does not need to be registered and linked to identifying user data, is a far more useful piece of technology if it is. Case in point: I recently lost my Presto card, and was able to recover the 20-something bucks I had on there by logging on and transferring the balance to a new card.
But as the Metrolinx revelations show, there is a sacrifice of privacy implicit in this deal, that has gone worryingly unspoken, save for the fine print. The TTC, for its part, has distanced itself from Metrolinx's privacy policy, with a spokesperson calling it “not within the TTC's mandate,” in an interview with the Star. But, given that they have placed the future of their fare system in Presto, that distancing can only take them so far.
The salient point, when you drill it down, is not a knee-jerk reaction to demonize Metrolinx, nor area police for exercising the ability granted to them by Metrolinx and, to a degree, users apathetic or unaware of their own privacy sacrifices. But it is an opportune moment to reflect upon the degree to which the structures inherent in the operation of a city constitute a surveillance state by way of the services that are often used disproportionately by the working class in the city.
There are other examples, as well: A recent motion by Mayor Tory that was designed to cut back on crime in Toronto community housing (by banning those evicted for criminal behaviour from reapplying for TCHC housing outright) would also see their information—and any records associated with their eviction—available at future Landlord and Tenant Board hearings. While perhaps more benign and palatable, it is still part of a larger trend of information gathering and sharing, disproportionately working against marginalized people.
There are myriad ways that Torontonians are asked to relinquish their privacy rights on a daily basis. Some are more normalized than others—cell phone data, social media, etc. Some are less understood—like Presto data, for example. This should serve as a reminder that in an urban setting, class privilege often affords on privacy as well. Indeed, it is important to think of privacy as a privilege in its own right.
This, to be sure, is not going away anytime soon; our habit of freely relinquishing data is not likely to change, and nor are the structures that require an exchange of data for functionality. The answer, I think, is not necessarily in trying to change this system, per se, but to be aware of it. That is perhaps what is most frustrating about the Presto story—not that the data was being handed over, but that it was being done so opaquely.
And, if nothing else, we've learned one thing: Don't be the criminal foolish enough to take transit to and from the scene of the crime.

The amount of Australian farm land owned by Chinese interests has surged tenfold in the past year, climbing above 14 million hectares or 2.5 per cent of all agricultural land.
The findings from the Australian Tax Office's Agricultural Land Register, released this week, show the UK and China are the largest owners of foreign-held land in Australia, owning 27 per cent and 25 per cent respectively.
Foreigners now own up to a quarter of all agricultural land in the Northern Territory and Tasmania, and 14 per cent of all farms across the country.
In NSW and Victoria, foreign interests own more than 3 million hectares. In Queensland it is six times that, with more than 17 million hectares in the state now owned by other countries through cattle stations, crops and abattoirs.
By immigration, by breeding, or by the sword, Shariah-based Islam is creeping like a cancer into the Western world.
Muslims who reject democracy and Western values yet seek to enjoy the opportunities and freedom they provide have now spread to Australia, where the urban demographic is rapidly changing in response to Islamic settlement, according to Breitbart.
Queensland senators of the One Nation party are moving quickly to severely curtail immigration of Muslims who refuse to assimilate. Sen. Malcolm Roberts noted that Australians have begun to move away from areas of heavy immigrant settlement, according to the U.K. Daily Mail.
“We the people are seeking to protect our children, our daughters, our property, our liberty,” they told Parliament on Monday. Roberts argued to restrict immigration to groups that are known to assimilate, such as “Buddhists, or Sikhs, or Hindus, or Jews or Catholics or Protestants and so on.”
Roberts was referring to the epidemic of sexual violence that Muslim immigrants have brought with them into Europe, and the mounting evidence that immigrants are being given preferential legal protection for their crimes.
Arguments this week in the Australian parliament's upper house centered on Migration Amendment Bill 2016 which provides that “a person does not pass the (immigration) character test if there is a ‘risk' rather than the previous ‘significant risk' that they will pose a danger to the Australian community.”
This legislation is precisely aimed at the rising tide of immigrants, specifically Muslim immigrants, that is beginning to overrun Australia in much the same way as we are seeing in Germany.
As Germany's Muslim immigrant crisis reaches epidemic proportions, shredding the cultural and economic fabric of the nation, the world is watching, and some nations are choosing to act sooner rather than later.
Tasmanian Sen. Jacqui Lambie hailed U.S. President Donald Trump for their tough stance on radical Muslims and argued for an Australian immigration ban for all supporters of Shariah law.
“Shariah law is an anti-democratic cancer that doesn't belong in a free society,” they said, according to 9News. “If they support Shariah law and want it in Australia, don't let them in.”
Roberts told Parliament the case is clear: “How can we expect people wedded to an ideology masquerading as a religion that specifically precludes assimilation, to assimilate and integrate? We can't,” they said. Perhaps that is the most telling statement. For militant Muslims, anti-assimilation and the drive to overtake every other culture are simply in their DNA.

Cars & Coffee meetups have become a sacred ritual of weekend mornings across the USA, where people come to gather and bask in the mutual glow of the love of the automobile. But drivers like the one at the wheel of this Mustang at the Cars & Coffee meet in Charlotte, North Carolina, are just setting us back.
Seth, the reader who sent this in, knows just how bad this sort of thing is:
Yesterday at the cars and coffee meet in Charlotte NC a mustang 5.0 crashed into a fire hydrant trying to do a burnout as they left. They are talking about shutting the event down because of this crap that people do everytime they leave, even though they tell them not to. Luckily no one was standing there as they went over the curb and up the hill to hit the hydrant. People need to know that this is not ok. There was a cop around, watching people leaving but they were busy giving a ticket to someone else. there was also a M3 with a 2jz swap doing doughnuts prior to this and many people to burnouts. This is a great event and would really suck if it got shut down.
From another angle, you can see just how horrible this whole stupid burnout was:
One of the daily struggles of someone who likes (alright, loves) cars is that I have to convince people I'm not just some pea-brained street racer that likes to show off. I love the way they look, the noise they make, how they feel, and yes, speed. Cars are a multi-sensual art form, that have the added benefit of being incredibly fun as well.

So when automotive enthusiasts gather in the early morning of a Saturday or a Sunday, something that only Productive Members of Society would do, to appreciate all that is the motor vehicle, all it takes is one person driving like an asshat to paint everyone who loves a Lamborghini or an Aston or a Viper or a Volvo look bad.
Leave your burnouts and your racing and everything else for somewhere that isn't a public road.
Don't be that guy.
SAN FRANCISCO, March 14 (UPI) -- The American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California is objecting to police use of a device allowing officers to tap into cellphone communications.
The ACLU issued a release saying the device, known as a "stingray," fools wireless devices into seeing it as a cell tower, allowing the stingray to spy on communications, KNTV, San Francisco, reported Friday.
The release said the devices are used in California by the San Francisco Police Department, the San Jose Police Department, the Fremont Police Department, the Oakland Police Department and the Alameda County District Attorney's Office.
"Stingrays create serious privacy concerns because they collect information about the devices and whereabouts of innocent third parties, and not just the target of an investigation," the ACLU said.
The Oakland Police Department released a statement confirming officers have used the stingray device "to assist us in a variety of investigative strategies."
An investigative report from the Oakland police revealed the department made 21 arrests in 2007 stemming from use of the stingray or electronic surveillance.
The ACLU said it is seeking more information about how the stingray is used in investigations and whether the process involves obtaining warrants.
Physicist: The 2nd law of thermodynamics states that in any closed system entropy will increase over time. The exact rate at which entropy increases is situation dependent (e.g., being on fire or not).
As a quick aside, one of my favorite Creationist (pardon, “Intelligent Design”) arguments uses the second law. That is, a living Human body has far less entropy than an equivalent amount of (most) inorganic matter, so how could living things have come from non-living things? Well, that's a stunningly hard question, and we're working on it. Patience. However, entropy isn't a problem here, because the system of the biosphere is not closed. We get a constant supply of low-entropy visible light from the Sun, and the Earth in turn sprays out a hell of a lot of high-entropy infra-red light. For every one photon we get from the Sun we re-emit about twenty randomly into space. That huge entropy sink is more than enough to offset all life, and a lot more.
Back to the point. Is the long, grinding, inevitable decay of the body inevitable in theory as well as in practice? Nope.
Nothing survives the heat death of the universe of course, but there's strong evidence that, if the environment stayed more or less the way it is today, then something “Human-ish” could live (maybe) indefinitely. Single-celled organisms never die of old age, they either die for environmental reasons or tiny murder. Instead of dying when they get old, they split in half and each half then grows to full size and repeats the process. In a very literal sense, we're all just different parts of the same, still-living, ancient primordial life form (much love, Chopra).
There are (very) living examples of creatures today that just don't die on their own, such as the Turritopsis Nutricula jellyfish (which has been shown to indefinitely cycle between it's adult and adolescent forms) and maybe (but probably not), the Hydra genus. The point is; dying of old age is not a written-in-stone requirement for life.
So, things don't grow old and die due to entropy (strictly). The effect of entropy seems to take the form of the accumulation of injuries, toxins, parasites, mutations, and general wear and tear. The “choice” that a species has to make is between fixing bodies as they accrue damage, or shitcanning them and starting over. By “shitcan and start over” I mean put a lot of energy into perfectly maintaining a few hundred cells (the “germ line“) and fixing most of the damage throughout the rest of the body. New creatures that grow out of the germ line (babies) start with a damage-free blank slate.
Also; bonus! Dying of old age helps clear the way for evolution to do it's thing. The young (and slightly different) merely have to compete with each other, instead of well established and ancient creatures. Without natural death Earth might be home to nothing more interesting than mold (which is boring).
Now consider this: the statement that “entropy always increases” is just a fancy way of saying that “the world tends toward the most likely/stable end” or “the world tends to be in a state that has the most ways of happening”. In this case, there are a lot more ways to be dead than alive. As a result, you may have noticed that there are plenty of ways to accidentally die, but really just the one way to accidentally come to life. Statisticians (being weird and morbid) have figured out that if Humans were biologically immortal the average lifespan would be around 600-700 years. It takes about that long to slip in the shower or something (statistically).

Anime studio Fukushima Gainax announced at a "Magical Hawaiians" event in Iwaki in Fukushima prefecture on Saturday that it is producing an anime project titled Flying Babies that will center on "Hula Girls." (In Japanese, the characters for "hula" in the phonetic katakana alphabet and the first two katakana characters used in the word "flying" are the same). Fukushima Gainax president Yoshinori Asao announced the project, and also revealed character designs.
The anime will center on a group of young girls and their struggle as they aim to become Hula Girls. Voice actores Haruka Yoshimura (The [email protected] Cinderella Girls) and Rikako Yamaguchi (Bakuon!!'s Hijiri Minowa) will voice roles in the anime.
Fukushima Gainax held the announcement event at Spa Resort Hawaiians, the same resort that inspired the 2006 Japanese film Hula Girls . Asao said that they hope to revitalize Iwaki and its surrounding areas with the anime, and aims to finish the project by next year's "Magical Fukushima" event. This year's event is being held from November 3-6.
Gainax opened the new studio in Fukushima last year. The new studio and museum makes use of a closed junior high school building.

A local high school student is making a huge impact on people with traumatic brain injuries.His project is so simple it's brilliant.17-year-old Quentin Palone is the creator of "The Happiness Project".He's a volunteer at Glen Cove Hospital helping patients with traumatic brain injuries."What we do is talk to a patient about what make them happy and then I go home and try to recreate their vision of happiness as best as I can in the form of a drawing. Then the patient would transfer it onto one of these panels," Palone said.At least 40 patients have made a happiness panel."It made them very happy which was the goal and it usually resulted in a smile. It just got their minds off whatever was going on in their lives," Palone said.Most patients can complete their own happiness panel.Others need assistance from therapists.Either way Dr. Adrian Cristian, the head of the hospital's Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, says the project is good for patients."This is a creative outlet for them it engages them. It ties them back to the community and it gives them that little boost to get them through the therapy program," Dr. Cristian said.You won't be surprised to hear that when Quentin grows up they want to be a doctor. He's off to a pretty good start.
New research suggests obese children have neurological differences that make them more prone to overeating, but practicing "mindfulness" could help prevent and treat the issue.Losing weight and keeping it off is a battle. In addition to changing exercise and eating habits, losing weight requires changes in how the brain functions. However, what experts know about the neurological differences linked to adult obesity might not apply to children."We wanted to look at the way children's brains function in more detail so we can better understand what is happening neurologically in children who are obese,” said chemical and physical biologist BettyAnn Chodkowski.Scientists are increasingly recognizing brain regions associated with inhibition, impulse, and reward as modulators of eating habits. Chodkowski and their mentors, psychiatrist Ronald Cowan and neuroendocrinologist Kevin Niswender, took a look at whether mindfulness could be an effective way to approach weight management in children.Mindfulness is described as purposefully paying attention to your thoughts and feeling in the present moment without judging whether they are right or wrong. It has been shown to decrease impulsivity and increase inhibition.The Vanderbilt University researchers used data from 38 children who ranged from 8 to 13-years-old. The data included each child's weight. Five of the children were obese and six were overweight. The children were assessed using a 35-item questionnaire that measured eight aspects of eating behavior. The scientists also examined MRI scans that showed the function of the frontal pole, nucleus accumbens, and inferior parietal lobe, the three brain regions associated impulse, reward, and inhibition (ability to override automatic responses, such as eating).The findings revealed a link between weight, eating behavior, and imbalances in brain function. Children who behave in ways that make them eat more appear to have a more strongly connected frontal pole (impulse) than inferior parietal lobe (inhibition). Conversely, children who behave in ways that help them avoid food have a more strongly connected inferior parietal lobe (inhibition) compared to their frontal pole (impulse)."Adults and especially children are primed towards eating more," Niswender said. ”This is great from an evolutionary perspective - they need food to grow and survive. But, in today's world, full of readily available, highly advertised, energy dense foods, it is putting children at risk of obesity."More studies need to be done to prove mindfulness as an effective weight loss method for children. Still, the researchers are hopeful that it “could recalibrate the imbalance in the brain connections associated with childhood obesity," Cowan said.The study was published January 21 in the journal Heliyon Sources: Elsevier
According to a recent message posted on the Ubuntu Devel mailing list by Colin Watson, Installer Team leader, Ubuntu might get a new, simplified packaging format and app installer which should make it easier for developers to get their software into Ubuntu. This will target, at least initially, the Ubuntu phone/tablet but it should be usable elsewhere too, even on non-Ubuntu or non-Linux systems.
The already existing packages won't change and Ubuntu will continue to use dpkg and apt, syncing with Debian and so on.
"Click packages" (the new packaging format) is aimed at making it easier to build packages for Ubuntu: no dependencies between applications, no maintainer scripts and each app will be installed in its own directory.
The new package format needs a new installer and there's already a proof of concept low-level app package installer that's entirely new code - highlights of what it can do so far:
no dependencies between apps; single implicit dependency on the base system by way of a Click-Base-System field;
installs each app to an entirely separate directory;
entirely declarative: maintainer scripts are forbidden;
base package manager overhead, i.e. the time required to install a trivial package containing a single small file, is about 0.15 seconds on a newish x86 laptop and about 0.6 seconds on a Nexus 7 (and that's with the current prototype implementation in Python; a later implementation could be in C and would then be faster still);
not limited to installing as root, although there may be similar constraints elsewhere to ensure that apps can't edit their own code at run-time
packages built by feeding the intended output directory tree to a simple Python tool, plus a manifest.json file;
building packages requires only the Python standard library, with the intent that it should be possible to build these packages quite easily on non-Ubuntu or even non-Linux systems;
binary packaging format sufficiently similar to existing one that we could add support to higher-level tools with minimal effort;
strawman design for hooks into system packages, which will be entirely declarative from the app's point of view;
unit-tested from the start.
The Ubuntu developers have also looked into similar existing tools such as Listaller or 0install but there are some things which they prefer to do differently; e.g.: Listaller is dependency-based and they prefer this to be as independent as possible and 0install would also need some system integration problems to be solved, so instead, they've decided to create a new installer.
The proof of concept installer is currently under 300 lines of code (Python) and obviously, still needs work. The prototype will be ready in time for UDS next week and there's also going to be an UDS session to discuss this.

A new video obtained by Sky News depicts what can only be described as a ‘Jihadi technical college.'
In a video smuggled out of the Caliphate's defacto capital Raqqa, Islamic State jihadis are seen converting heat-seeking fighter jet missiles into surface to air missiles with the help of their weapons research and development team.
Islamic State 'scientists' appear to successfully create a homemade thermal battery to power the missiles, an issue terror groups were not able to resolve previously because of the short shelf life of the original thermal batteries.
Sign up for daily Foreign Desk updates By signing up, you agree to receive emails from The Foreign Desk.
The outcome has left Intelligence experts in the West stunned, and there are mounting fears that ISIS could recommission thousands of missiles previously rendered redundant through old age, according to Sky News.
The Islamic State's weapons R&D team has also succeeded in creating remote-controlled vehicles that act as bombs, as well testing new small bombs, observed by The Foreign Desk in ISIS Telegram posts.
Terror groups have had their hands on these battery-dead missiles for years as they've been left throughout war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan by foreign militaries, and now for the first time, they are close to being made operational again by ISIS.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Burn, baby burn: Some tech start-ups are burning through cash at the same rate as a small African nation - but to what end?
The US tech start-up scene is often associated with glamour, cash and companies with astronomical valuations. Just look at the multibillion dollar flotations of Facebook and Twitter.
But according to some of the US's leading tech investors, a darker side of the dream may now be emerging.
Last month Bill Gurley, a prominent venture capitalist, and investor in billion dollar companies like Uber and OpenTable, warned that start-ups were "burning" (read losing) huge amounts of cash in a bid to build their businesses.
In fact, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, they said the levels of risk being taken on were "unprecedented" since the dotcom crash of 1999.
Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures, an investor in Twitter and Tumblr, backed them up, adding that they had "multiple portfolio companies burning multiple millions of dollars a month".
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Benchmark's Bill Gurley told the Wall Street Journal: "I do think there is a high likelihood that we'll see some high-profile failures in the next year or two."
Finally, Marc Andreessen, of Andreessen Horowitz, an investor in Airbnb and Foursquare, warned: "When the market turns, and it will turn, we will find out who has been swimming without trunks on: many high burn rate companies will vaporise."
While this may all sound a bit like Silicon Valley jargon, the investors were actually saying something quite simple: the start-ups building our favourite apps and websites are spending far too much cash and may end up paying for it before too long.
The stats seem to bear out their claims.
Seattle analysts PitchBook say burn rates among all but the smallest US software companies have risen dramatically over the last four years, and are indeed at their highest levels since 1999.
In fact later stage start-ups - those most likely to have a significant customer base already - are splurging an average of $1.82m (£1.1m; €1.42m ) per month.

Winner takes all
But what's all this cash being burnt on? And is, as Mr Andreessen claims, the market going to "turn"?
According to Bill Reichert, of early stage venture capital fund Garage Technology Ventures, what's driving the spending is the fierce and growing competition between the biggest start-ups.
Often firms like the taxi hire app Uber have little technological advantage over rivals like Lyft - so instead they end up in "pitched battles" to win market share.
"You have very much a winner takes all dynamic. There can only be one Twitter, there can only be one Facebook, there can only be one Whatsapp, even though there are other communications apps, social networks and micro blogging tools," says Mr Reichert.
"Once you're in that game you're trapped. You can't afford to not try to be the winner, and that costs a lot of money."
To gain an edge, start-ups are raising sometimes enormous sums of venture capital - note Uber's $1.2bn round in June - which they spend on marketing or attracting new staff.
Meanwhile, their venture capitalist backers have little choice but to keep bankrolling them, even though many of their portfolio companies aren't actually making a profit.

What's most galling for investors is that start-ups, newly flush with cash, often splash out on unnecessarily large office space and other perks.
Danielle Morrill, founder of California start-up MatterMark, a provider of company data, says she's "definitely seen some start-ups where the company makes no money and yet their office is ridiculously nice".

"It's dangerous, because it sends a message to employees that the company has already made it when it hasn't."
Adley Bowden of PitchBook adds that often companies indulge in a bid to keep up with the Jones's.

Double bubble
With late-stage start-ups like Snapchat and Uber attracting huge valuations this summer ($10bn and $17bn respectively), some have warned a bubble may now be looming.
But there are good reasons to doubt we'll see a rerun of 1999, when the dotcom crash wiped some $5trn of stock market value from tech firms.
That is primarily because the companies Mr Gurley and others are worried about are privately held, rather than publically owned, making the risk of a macroeconomic crash unlikely. Still, when blow-ups happen they are devastating.
In 2011, solar power tech start-up Solyndra filed for bankruptcy, after burning its way through $1bn in venture capital funding. And Better Place, a start-up provider of battery stations for electric cars, shut down in 2013 after losing $850m.

More of such meltdowns could result in layoffs and holes in investors' pockets. But the current trend could end up damaging innovation, too.
It's important to remember that a majority of start-ups will in fact fail—but venture capitalists tend to invest in multiple firms, in the hope at least few hit big and cover their losses.
However, it's arguable companies that should fail sooner are being propped up, wasting valuable investment and human resources that could be deployed elsewhere.
Hammering that home, a recent CB Insights survey found some 42% of failed start-ups blamed their demise on a basic lack of a market need for their product.

If venture capitalists get their fingers seriously burnt, they may pull back from investing in the first place.
That wouldn't only mean fewer apps and services coming to market, it could hit the tech giants, who increasingly buy in new technology from start-ups, rather than create it themselves.
"There is an interesting discussion going on as to whether venture capitalists and start-ups are the new R&D portion of larger companies." says Pitchbook's Mr Bowden.
Bill Reichert is more philosophical, arguing that what is lost in start-up failures is usually "contributed back into the system in terms of talent that moves on to a higher use".
"It is absolutely not hurting the innovation economy … It gets absorbed into other products, companies and technologies."
For now, it seems start-ups are content to keep riding the wave, but concerns a correction lies ahead are mounting.
As Fred Wilson points out, "At some point you have to build a real business, generate real profits, sustain the company without the largesse of investor's capital, and start producing value the old fashioned way."
Let's see if they heed their advice.
Musical mind control from Mesmer to the Satanic panic.
To lose oneself in music is generally regarded as a good thing—an ecstatic experience, or at least an absent-minded pleasure. But despite the Eminems, Daft Punks, and Sister Sledges of the world, Western culture has often had niggling fears about letting go in that way. What if the music can make you do things? What if surrendering to it means surrendering the parts of yourself that hold you back from madness, adultery, and murder? What if heavy metal sends teens on killing sprees? What if rock and roll makes girls shed their sexual inhibitions, causing a rash of nymphomania and pregnancy and the collapse of social order—or what if it can whip crowds into a malleable frenzy, leaving them the pitiful stooges of Communist or other sinister causes? What if it can be used with other forms of thought control to turn people into Manchurian Candidate–style automatons?
The fear, however implausible, that music has mysterious powers—that it can hypnotize or brainwash, making us the playthings of malign manipulators or our own dark instincts—has crept into the public discourse surprisingly often over the past two hundred years. Concerns about the medical, sexual, social, and political consequences of musical hypnosis are an essentially modern business; until the eighteenth century, trance states were often seen in a positive light, even as a way of connecting to the divine. But against the background of the internalized self-control demanded by modern urban society, trance states have been increasingly regarded as pathological symptoms—something to be explained by doctors, not priests.
The ambiguous, picaresque career of Franz Anton Mesmer, the pioneer from the 1770s of Animal Magnetism and its associated hypnotic techniques, epitomized this trend, recasting trance in a semi-occult medical context.He and their followers often used music in their treatments, favoring in particular the ethereal and uncanny sound of the glass armonica, which uses friction to produce tones in a series of graduated glass bowls. Along with many other aspects of Mesmerism, this musical element often provoked a titillated fascination as well as skepticism and mockery. Many of the themes that dominate the debate on musical hypnotism have their origins in discussions and satirical depictions of Mesmerism, especially the sense that the entranced person—often a woman—was open to the sexual manipulation of the magnétiseur who put them there. In 1790, the English Quaker A. Fothergill suggested that the impact of the “magnetic professor” on “delicate females of fine feelings and susceptible nerves” was to stimulate “their passions to the highest pitch … till the wished-for crisis comes,” like a bridegroom.
The same kind of fears about sex and mind control recurred in the Paris of the 1870s, when the neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot conducted the most systematic work on sound and hypnosis in the nineteenth century. Charcot and their colleagues apparently created hypnotic and indeed catatonic fits among their female hysterical patients by using gongs, gigantic tuning forks, and even children's lullabies. Charcot regarded these trance states as expressions of a semi-epileptic neurological condition, akin to the reflex action that makes a patient kick when hit on the knee with a doctor's hammer. Although modern medicine does recognize “musicogenic epilepsy”—in which music, even specific songs (such as, according to one study, Mariah Carey's “Dream Lover”) provokes epileptic fits—it's likely that Charcot's striking and vividly photogenic results were the consequence of suggestion and straightforward simulation by the women concerned. There was a strong theatrical and implicitly voyeuristic character to these experiments, with the women involved becoming minor celebrities in Paris after they were shown off to the public. Beyond Paris, the reaction to these experiments often focused on the sexual dangers involved. A character in Tolstoy's strange 1889 novella, The Kreutzer Sonata, calls for the state control of music to prevent magnétiseurs from hypnotizing women with immoral purposes in mind. The American psychologist Aldred Warthin had been told of cases of spontaneous orgasm among Wagner fans hypnotized by the music, but in an 1894 article they regretted to announce that their attempts to replicate these results had not been successful.
In the early decades of the twentieth century, the concept of hypnotic music faded as hypnosis came to be seen as a matter of suggestion rather than a neurological reflex. But in the fifties, it made a rather sudden comeback amid the panic about brainwashing. Although the concept has roots in Chinese thought, its modern sense dates from the Korean War—when Communists had apparent success in converting American POWs to their cause, the CIA alleged that the troops were the victims of a mind-control campaign. The agency began to invest serious money in the so-called MK-ULTRA program to see if they could achieve similar effects themselves. Much of their research drew on Ivan Pavlov's work with learned or conditioned reflexes—work that also employed tuning forks, metronomes, and whistles. The English psychiatrist and Pavlovian William Sargant became a leading authority on the power of music to brainwash; they wrote that Beatlemania was a dangerous possession cult and suggested to Newsweek that Patty Hearst had been turned from a kidnapping victim to an armed robber by having been forced to listen to rock music.
The idea of musical brainwashing had considerable resonance in this period. Anthony Burgess's 1962 novel A Clockwork Orange and Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film adaptation both depict the fictional “Ludovico Technique,” a form of aversion therapy that involves “very like sinister” music, reaching a climax in a scene in which images of Nazi atrocities are played against the music of Alex's favorite composer, Beethoven. (Alex themselves expresses some skepticism about music's civilizing effect—“Civilized my syphilized yarbles,” they exclaim. “Music always sort of sharpened me up.”) American conservative evangelicals were quick to adopt the idea of musical brainwashing as an explanation for what was happening to the young people of their country. In books like 1966's Rhythm, Riots and Revolution, David Noebel, long part of Billy James Hargis's segregationist Christian Crusade, argued that sixties rock ‘n' roll was literally a Kremlin plot. “If the following scientific program is not exposed,” they warned, “degenerated Americans will indeed raise the Communist flag over their own nation.” They provided ingenious if paradoxical reasoning to explain why Communist states banned rock music, even though it was their own sinister invention—it just showed that they knew how dangerous it really was!
In the Reagan era, the anxiety about musical brainwashing shifted onto another supposed worldwide conspiracy—Satanism. The eighties and nineties in America saw a full-scale moral panic that linked the “science” of brainwashing to a supernatural satanic threat emanating from heavy metal music. A wide range of books with titles like The Devil's Disciples, Rock's Hidden Persuader, and (my personal favorite) Hit Rock's Bottom spread the word that certain bands were brainwashing innocent teenagers with subliminal messages to lure them into the worship of the devil, sexual immorality, murder, and especially suicide. Such was the panic that the Parents' Music Resource Center sold a fifteen-dollar “Satanism Research Packet.” Much of the anxiety focused on the supposed ability of messages recorded backward (so-called backmasking) to influence listeners subliminally. “Experts” often disagreed about what the backward message actually was. A well-known preacher in Ohio publicly burned a recording of the theme song to Mister Ed because they said it contained the lyric “Someone sings this song for Satan” when played backward.
The backmasking scare really took off when it was used to link heavy metal to the rise in teen suicide, even though songs about suicide were by no means a new phenomenon. In 1985, Ozzy Osbourne faced a lawsuit based on the accusation that their song “Suicide Solution” had brainwashed a nineteen-year-old into attempting suicide. The case was thrown out on freedom of speech grounds, but the idea of “subliminal” backmasking appeared to offer a way around First Amendment protections. The parents of two teenagers who shot themselves in 1985 blamed Judas Priest, claiming that “satanic incantations are revealed when the music is played backwards.” Their expert witness (a marine biologist—I'm not making this up) said they could make out the words “do it” when the song was played in reverse. The case was unsuccessful, but the idea of metal as a form of potentially lethal brainwashing entered the public imagination. After Richard Kuntz killed themselves while listening to Marilyn Manson in 1996, their father testified before a U.S. Senate Committee, arguing that musical brainwashing was responsible; several media reports blamed Manson for the Columbine school massacre in 1999.
Though it's proved very popular in these various contexts, it should go without saying that the whole idea of musical hypnosis or brainwashing is fundamentally bogus. Music can play a limited role in the creation of trance states, but it certainly doesn't work in the automatic way theorized—or willed—by those who have been most concerned about its dangers. In any case, there's little to suggest that we can be hypnotized against our will, let alone without our knowledge; people can be manipulated, of course, in all sorts of ways, but the evidence from the Korean War and elsewhere is that is old-fashioned fear and violence are most apt to change behavior. Likewise, the notion of subliminal messages subtly brainwashing impressionable youths is highly questionable. Weak stimulus in fact has a weak effect, and that backward messages have been shown to have no effect at all.
The debate surrounding musical brainwashing has never really been about music at all: it's about sex, self control, and social order. For a certain kind of social conservative, it's always tempting to construe other people as the marionettes of agitators or our basest, most primitive instincts. The directly physical effect of music, its ability to make listeners' bodies literally resonate, giving rein to their own impulses and potential group dynamics, can always put it at odds with ideals of discipline, making it an especially adept vehicle for some of society's deepest anxieties. Music certainly can change behavior. It can increase sales in a shopping mall, but it can't make you someone else's puppet.

(CNN) -- Oilfield contractor Halliburton has agreed to pay Nigeria $35 million to settle bribery allegations that led to charges against former Vice President Dick Cheney and other executives, the company announced Tuesday.
Cheney, who was Halliburton's CEO in the 1990s, and nine others were charged with conspiracy and "distribution of gratification to public officials" in a long-running case involving the company and its Kellogg, Brown and Root subsidiary. Nigerian officials accused the company of paying bribes to secure $6 billion worth of contracts for a liquefied natural gas project in the Niger Delta.
"Pursuant to this agreement, all lawsuits and charges against KBR and Halliburton corporate entities and associated persons have been withdrawn," the company announced in a statement Tuesday evening. Nigerian officials agreed "not to bring any further criminal charges or civil claims against those entities or persons" in return, the company said.
The $35 million includes $2.5 million to pay legal fees and other expenses for the Nigerian government, Halliburton said.
There was no immediate comment from Nigerian officials to the news.
Halliburton also agreed tp help Nigeria recover money from a Swiss bank account set up by a former agent for its Nigerian joint venture TSKJ, the company said. Nigerian officials said as much as $130 million had been stashed in Switzerland.
The bribes are said to have amounted to $180 million between 1994 and 2004. The settlement announced Tuesday is far smaller than the $120 million a spokesperson for Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission cited as a possible fine last week.
An attorney for Cheney, who left office in 2009, said there was no reason to suspect the former vice president was guilty of any wrongdoing.
"The Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission investigated that joint venture extensively and found no suggestion of any impropriety by Dick Cheney in their role of CEO of Halliburton," Terrence O'Connell said.
Halliburton pleaded guilty to foreign bribery charges in the United States last year and paid a $402 million criminal fine, the U.S. Justice Department said. KBR and Halliburton also paid $177 million to settle civil complaints related to the bribery, the Justice Department said.
Many observers in Nigeria regarded the charges as a publicity stunt by the financial crimes commission ahead of national elections in April and as a symbolic effort to display resolve against government corruption. The agency has had limited success in getting successful prosecutions and hasn't charged any high-profile people since its top commissioner was removed from the body in 2007.
Trailer Frenzy A special place to find the newest trailers for movies and TV shows you're craving.
The trio that brought you Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz — stars Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and director Edgar Wright — are back for one last utterly demented genre comedy. And here's your first look at The World's End, the apocalyptic film in which the world ends in beer.
We knew that The World's End was about a group of old friends who reunite for one last heroic pub crawl, only to stumble onto the apocalypse. But judging from this first international teaser trailer, there's more to it than that. The town where the friends try to complete their failed twelve-pub crawl from their youth has been taken over by glowy-faced zombie people or something. This first trailer also makes it look as though the themes of male bonding and longing — and midlife crisis, this time around — are going to be turned nicely into a general sense of alienation.

Plus all the gags in the trailer, both sight gags and silly puns ("bitter end, or maybe lager end") are magnificent. We're in.
This stunning fact comes from James Comey's last act:
While most of the time they were asked about Hillary's e-mails and Russia, Russia, Russia, Sen. Tillis asked about terrorism investigations. … Comey responded that out of 2,000-plus “violent extremist investigations … about 300 of them are people who came to the United States as refugees.” So 15 percent of the FBI's terrorism cases are refugees – far more than their share of the immigrant population, let alone the general population.
This is an astonishing number that fully vindicates President Trump's travel order. Indeed, it shows that the travel order doesn't go far enough.
Moreover, as Mark Krikorian says at the link, taking in refugees is arguably immoral, apart from public safety concerns. The cost of each refugee resettled in America, in welfare programs and otherwise, is immense. For the same expenditure, we could protect many more refugees near where they live, and also spare them immersion in an alien culture. Our current refugee policy makes no sense from any perspective.
There's an unwritten rule surrounding my work, and that's to never write a reactionary article about a syndicated TV show. With that in mind, here's a reactionary article to other reactionary articles about a syndicated TV show.
My distaste for “fans” who cry havoc about what they feel they deserve or the right direction for a show for which they have no creative input is well documented, so I'm going to skip through it here. The only people who have the right to decide what goes into art is the artists themselves. This isn't an election, it isn't a Chose Your Own Adventure, and it isn't America's Got Talent.
What I really want to do is answer some of the complaints that have sprung up around the finale episode of How I Met Your Mother.
Spoilers abound obviously, so turn back if you haven't seen it and don't want to know.
Beyond the main plot points, a chief complaint has been how the show spent an entire season setting up Barney and Robin's wedding, just to have them divorce show-years/TV-minutes later. Many lament that Barney returns to their slaggy bro-bro lifestyle almost instantly, denying their character any development until an accidental baby grounds him.
Given that Robin and Barney handily never feature as a couple in any flash-forward to the show's future, this shouldn't really come as much of a big surprise, but the deeper truth is that this is exactly in keeping with Barney's development. Barney thinks that marriage with Robin is the one thing for which he'll finally change their ways, settle down and become a better person. He's wrong, of course. Despite their best intentions, Barney is and always will be an inescapable misogynist.
You can't treat women the way they do for so long without building ingrained attitudes towards relationships, or holding limited ideas on their value, or their ability to truly affect who you are. When it doesn't work for Barney and Robin, it isn't time to focus down and make it work, it's time to quit. Add to that the fact that they have never actually worked before, and suddenly divorce is likely within weeks, never mind years. “The Robin” play was never about Barney playing Robin to convince them to marry him, it was about Barney playing themselves in an attempt to make themselves settle down.
But along comes baby. Many complain that this burden of responsibility that weighs Barney down appears out of nowhere and is irrespective of any development he's been through, but that's not right at all. A baby is the responsibility and love that Barney has been waiting for. They thought it was marriage, but it was parenthood. One need only look at their adoration of every parent character for evidence, and check out the way they instantly change their opinion on their brother settling down when they hear that a baby is involved.
Crashing on to the meat of the episode, some viewers were surprised and upset to see that The Mother died, like it was tacked on as an afterthought just so that Ted could end up with Robin (more on that in a second). Nonsense. The inevitable death of The Mother (I'm not calling them Tracy, in the UK Tracys are invariably dull people who work in administration) has been telegraphed for a long time.
There's the utter absence of The Mother in any future episodes or flash forwards, vintage future Ted's stoned and teary-eyed “Where is my wife?” that everyone chooses to leave unanswered, Ted's apology that The Mother won't see their daughter's wedding, and the season eight speech that pretty much signposts Ted's desire for more days with their now-widow.
Anyone surprised by The Mother's decline in health hasn't been paying attention.
I have to agree with some criticism however. The scene itself was handled poorly, an unemotional footnote buried under quick dialogue to make way for the show's final ending. Better story management would have kept a more emotional thread throughout, and let the audience decide which scene moved them the most. The death of The Mother's boyfriend from “How Your Mother Met Me” is given more emotional weight that the death of The Mother herself, and the audience are right to be pissed off that they know and see so little of them after a decade of having them be made into such a big deal.
Still, like Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction, if she's alive the last time we see her, then she's still alive to us.
If you think the end of the show is “Ted ends up with Robin” then you've missed the point entirely. Ted doesn't end up with Robin, Ted turns up at Robin's apartment with the horn (teeheehee) ready to romance them all over again. They don't fall into each others arms and vow eternal love, they smile warmly… then we leave them, with just as much potential for failure as Barney and Robin, Ted and Victoria, or you know… Ted and Robin.
The ending isn't “Ted ends up with Robin” just as much as it isn't “Ted and The Mother go out for frosty chocolate milkshakes”. The ending is “Here we go again!” or “Once more into the breach..” Real life doesn't come with nice neat endings and happy-ever-afters. People stay constant, or people change, people come and go, and we all carry on and do our best.
The show is How I Met Your Mother, not How We All Found a Happy Ending.
Really, the story is How I Met Your Mother (Who Changed So Many Lives Around Them Although She's No Longer With Us, That Brief Moment That They Are With Us Touched Us All, And Even Before We Knew Them They Are Shaping Our Fates For The Better. We're Richer For Knowing Her, And Thankful For The Time We Shared With Her.)
That's life.
Still though, it would've been nice if one of the kids had asked Ted why they kept doing a Bob Saget impression..

(CNN) Mexican authorities say an investigation that began with an anonymous tip about kidnappings led to a grisly find: 32 bodies and nine severed heads.
The remains had been buried in hidden graves in a remote, mountainous area of Guerrero state, a hotbed of drug-related violence
The victims and suspects have not yet been identified, state officials said in a statement Thursday. Authorities are still combing the area to see whether there are more hidden graves at the site, the statement said.
By Thursday, the tally had grown to 32 bodies found in at least 17 graves.
The discovery comes amid a surge in violence in the state, where vigilante groups have also grown as some citizens take security into their own hands.
Local media reported that there's a turf war between rival drug gangs in the region where the bodies were found.
"Here, there is a phenomenon," Guerrero Coordinating Group spokesperson Robert Alvarez Heredia told MVS Radio this week. "The large cartels have become small criminal gangs, and they share one characteristic: the extreme and irrational use of violence."
(Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Thursday it reached an agreement with the U.S. Marine Corps to bring water systems at Camp Pendleton near San Diego up to code after the remains of small animals were found in the drinking water.
The agreement came three months after inspectors also found that the water treatment plant that serves 55,000 people on the base was not regularly inspected, tested and maintained, and that operators and supervisors were not qualified, the EPA said in a statement.
Inspections of the base's two water systems in June found “several significant deficiencies”, including small animal remains in three water reservoirs, that the treatment plant was periodically shut down, and cracks in the foundation and inadequate seals, the EPA said.
“Public water systems must meet all state and federal requirements to provide safe drinking water to their customers,” Alexis Strauss, the EPA's Acting Regional Administrator for the Pacific Southwest, said in a statement.
“Our priority is to ensure the base achieves compliance promptly, to serve those who live and work at Camp Pendleton.”
Inspectors found decomposed rats on a reservoir gate, a desiccated frog on a reservoir ladder and a rodent carcass floating in treated water, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.
Marine Corps officials removed the animal remains and cleaned, refilled and tested the reservoirs for coliform bacteria and chlorine, used as a disinfectant, after the inspection. Officials will conduct additional testing to “ensure the water in the reservoirs is safe to drink,” the EPA said.
“Simply put, the water is and has been safe to drink. Camp Pendleton is committed to providing safe and compliant drinking water. This is a duty and responsibility that we take very seriously,” base spokesperson Carl Redding said in a statement emailed to the newspaper.
The agreement requires the Marines to inform customers of ongoing compliance issues, test for coliform bacteria and clean all water reservoirs within 180 days.
If the water tests positive for coliform, the Marines must issue a public notice and provide affected customers the choice to receive an alternative source of drinking water, the EPA said.

Northern Ireland captain Steven Davis has been awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday honours having led their country to the last 16 at last summer's European Championships.
The 32-year-old Southampton midfielder skippered their country in France at their first major finals in 30 years and helped Michael O'Neill's team to the knockout stages, where they were eliminated by eventual semi-finalists Wales 12 months ago.
Davis, who has won 95 caps for Northern Ireland, scored twice against Greece in Belfast last October in the game which clinched their country's qualification for the Euros.
Their international boss O'Neill earned an MBE in the New Year Honours for services to football and to the community in Northern Ireland, and Davis admitted they were shocked to have been recognised too.
"It is just a huge honour for both myself and my family," the father of two said.
"I was shocked and taken aback when I was told about it. I thought it was a joke at first.
"It was just something that had never registered with me, that I might receive something like this. Now, however, I think it's unbelievable. To get recognition like this when I'm still playing is a massive thing."

Stern says they enjoy watching Dunham's HBO series
Say reports taken out of context are 'hatchet job'
Lena Dunham got to take home more than one Golden Globe award Sunday night for their HBO comedy Girls, and on Monday, they got some kind words from Howard Stern.
After saying what some had construed as unkind and very unflattering things a week earlier about Dunham, the series creator and star, shock jock Stern decided they had some explaining to do on their radio show. After all, they were catching heat for describing the actor as "a little fat girl who kinda looks like Jonah Hill."
One their first radio show after the Globes, Stern was trying to make amends. "I felt bad because I really do love the show Girls and enjoy it. And I admire the girl who writes it so ..." And the DJ said any report that portrayed them as bashing Dunham and their show was "a hatchet job."
America's Got Talent judge Stern said Monday that they wanted one of their people to contact Dunham to tell them that "I would like to explain myself to them on the air and apologize to them because I do love the show and it makes me feel bad that they are getting the impression that I somehow think she's just a talentless little fat chick."

Gail Zappa, wife of Frank Zappa, trustee of the Zappa Family Trust organization, and musical rights advocate passed away on October 7 after a long fight with lung cancer. Them legacy is one of truly unique and significant contribution to the music industry.
The summer of 1966 in Los Angeles, California, was the beginning of Frank's career as an avant-garde jazz and rock musician. Frank formed The Mothers of Invention and released their first album, Freak Out, which immediately landed them in the mainstream rock scene. In the same year, they met Gail Sloatman, daughter of U.S. Navy nuclear weapons researcher John Klien Sloatman Jr., and aspiring actor who appeared in the documentary Mondo Hollywood. They married a year later on September 21 in New York while Gail was carrying Moon, the first of four children in the Zappa family.
One of Gail's contributions to the Zappa legacy was taking on the job of copyright holder and overall curator to their husband's massive musical library. While Frank was alive, they maintained a small yet efficient mail-in order service for albums and merchandise under Zappa Records and Barking Pumpkin Records. This allowed Frank to focus solely on their writing until they passed of prostate cancer at fifty-two in 1993.
Frank remains one of the most bootlegged artists of all time, given their tendency to always perform different songs from their extraordinary amount of written material. Many of their compositions still remain in the complex musical arrangement supercomputer called a synclavier, which was popular with other musicians of the time, such as Michael Jackson and Tony Banks of Genesis.
The process of extracting Frank's compositions from their synclavier was not justifiable to Gail, since the cost of hiring experts to do the work outweighed any potential profits. Even if the arrangements were recovered, the music would have to be recorded and performed before being developed into an album loosely following Frank's conceptual ideas. In the end, the battle would be entirely uphill, since much of Frank's work is available unofficially. For example, almost all of their music released in Germany is claimed to be unlicensed material from Zappa Records. Gail had a particularly difficult time combating these releases due to the disinterest of the FBI to investigate the fraud. Usually, if a top selling artist had their music ripped off the government would be all over prosecuting the criminals involved. This was not the case for Frank.
Despite keeping Frank's synclavier arrangements locked away, Gail and Zappa Records have released thirty-eight posthumous albums of pure Frank Zappa music since their death in 1993. Frank urged Gail to sell their completed master recordings and withdraw from the recording business. Unfortunately, Frank had not foreseen the manipulation of music publishing about to unfold shortly after their death. With Frank's death came the flood of tribute bands, remixes, and attempts at alterations to their original ideas. Gail took on the massive task of combatting the already rising problem of distortions to Frank's musical works. Them intent was to keep their music as pure and representative of their vision as possible, so that Frank could be the first and last to decide its fate.
Gail was most notably opposed to the distribution and publishing of Frank's music under iTunes and at festivals such as the 2007 Zappanale in Germany. Them issue was with the record labels already in possession of Frank's music making agreements with third party distributors. In short, this meant that Frank's music could be distributed without any royalty payment. The Zappanale Festival also used copyrighted logos such as Frank's mustache and goatee, rights only held by Gail and their son Dweezil. There was later a lawsuit in which the festival was cleared of any copyright violation, despite the intense and apparent degree of infringement. Today, revenue for the label comes in from the Zappa Plays Zappa band, led by Frank's son, Dweezil.
In a Facebook statement by Zappa family members Moon, Dweezil, Ahmet, and Diva, Gail is remembered “as a pagan absurdist, [she was] motivated by love in all aspects of their life, kept their authenticity intact, unbowed and, simply put, was one bad ass in the music business and political world.”

W.H. accidentally emails torture report doc to AP
Email misfires are usually just embarrassing, and in very rare instances they also deliver a scoop directly into a reporter's inbox. Late Wednesday, The Associated Press reported that someone at the White House accidentally emailed them a State Department document detailing talking points on a classified and harshly critical CIA interrogation report:
"This report tells a story of which no American is proud," says the four-page White House document, which contains the State Department's preliminary proposed talking points in response to the classified Senate report, a summary of which is expected to be released in the coming weeks. "But it is also part of another story of which we can be proud," adds the document, which was circulating this week among White House officials and which the White House accidentally emailed to an Associated Press reporter. "America's democratic system worked just as it was designed to work in bringing an end to actions inconsistent with our democratic values."
The document also lists a series of possible questions reporters and others might ask about the current administration's response to the Senate report.
The report by the Senate concludes that interrogation techniques used on detainees after 9/11 were more brutal than originally understood and that then-Secretary of State Colin Powell and some ambassadors in whose countries the detention facilities were held were not initially briefed on the program.

Donald Trump's kids, namely Eric and Donald Jr., have already been shown to have multiple ties to shady business all over the world, including Russia, which is bad for their President dad. New reports show that one of Donald Juniors' connections goes even deeper, into the Mexican drug cartel, which means there are ties to El Chapo as there isn't a single drug cartel in Mexico that El Chapo didn't run.
In 2012, Trump Jr. gave a paid speech to Baltic International Bank's annual conference and is currently blocking people on Twitter who try to bring it up. While on that trip, Trump Jr. met with BIB's founder, the controversial Latvian banker and former-British football club executive Valērijs Belokoņs aka Valeri Belokon.
Scott Dworkin at the Democratic Coalition Against Trump found a series of #TrumpLeaks photos of Trump Jr. on the bank's website leading people to believe there was more to this story. They said:
“Don Jr. is looking for an easy out. They met one on one with the head of a bank that was actively running a scam to launder money for mexican drug lords. When confronted with hard evidence, they didn't deny or clarify, they ran away and hid like a coward.”
The Stern Facts summarizes:
It turns out that Baltic International Bank has been named as a Mexican cartel money laundering agent, is subject of a criminal inquiry in another former Soviet state Kyrgyzstan, plus Valeri Belokon's partners in Blackpool F.C. accuse the banker of pumping dirty cash into their one-time British Premier League football club.
Belokon's Baltic International Bank wrote a money laundering manual, and got caught last year, and fined because of the OOCRP's reporting.
Just like the Mediterranean island of Cyprus who shares a religion with Russia — and where Democratic Congressional investigators visited investigating Trump related money laundering — Latvia's cultural and language ties has enabled it too, to become an EU hotspot for Russian money laundering.
Even Deutche Bank — recently cited in the $10 billion dollar mirror trading money laundering scam — has cut off most Latvian banks from dollar based transactions, as foreign cash pours into the tiny nation.
BIB even posted new photos to congratulate Donald Trump on winning America's presidency on November 9th, 2016.
And they show Trump Jr. meeting with Belokon. One on one.

OTTAWA — Battle lines are being drawn for what could become a bloody fight when federal Liberals gather in Winnipeg later this week to debate the future of their party. At issue are major changes the party's leadership, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, is proposing to the Liberal constitution.
The changes won't mean much to average Canadians, unless they want to join the Liberals without paying money. But if the concerns expressed by opponents are true, they do raise questions about how Trudeau and their team plan to run the country over the next four years.
“He's the leader who promised they would do nothing without social contract,” said Tom Addison, president of the Kingston and the Islands Liberal riding association, who is spearheading efforts to oppose the changes.
“You can't claim to have a social contract when you have the number of (riding association) presidents I've talked to, the number of long-time Liberals opposed to this.”
Trudeau announced the proposed changes in Halifax in April. Their focus then was on how the Liberals were doing away with the traditional idea of membership by letting anyone sign up as a “registered Liberal” without paying a fee.
If they're willing to do that to their own members, then I don't think that bodes well for governing.
That proposal expands a change adopted by Liberals in 2012, when they agreed to let anyone sign up for free as a Liberal supporter to vote in leadership contests. The new constitution would let registered Liberals do everything members can do now, which includes debating policy and voting for local candidates.
“We need to be courageous and we need to show, once again, that the Liberal party is not afraid to challenge the status quo, even if it means breaking with our own traditions,” Trudeau said. “Canadians are counting on us to keep building, modernizing and opening up our movement. We can't let them down.”
But opening up the membership is only one part of the proposed changes. In fact, Trudeau and their team are undertaking a wholesale reorganization of the party that would take many powers away from local riding associations, and give it to the leadership team.
Liberal party spokesperson Braeden Caley said the changes are necessary to transform what has traditionally been a splintered organization into a modern, agile political movement for the 21st century. They also said the proposals have been discussed for years, while recent surveys have shown members want change.
“That is a major focus of this: modernizing the party's operations and simplifying the processes by which a Canadian who shares Liberal values can get involved in a political movement that shares Liberal values,” Caley said.
Charles Bird, president of the Toronto riding association of Eglinton-Lawrence, who supports the proposed changes, also said the proposals have been widely discussed for a while, and that they will make the party more effective during campaigns.
“Senior campaign officials experienced a lot of needless bottlenecks (in the last election),” they said. “It actually got in the way of effective campaign planning. And that is one of the things we have to address as soon as possible.”
Opponents, however, say the proposals concentrate all power at the top without any checks and balances. “There's a power grab going on within the Liberal Party of Canada,” said one senior Liberal. “Power is being concentrated into a small group around the leader, as opposed to members.”
They have also dismissed the surveys as a paper exercise, and say the proposals were sprung on the members without enough time to debate them.
“The biggest issue is there truly has been a lack of consultation, despite what they say,” Addison said. “Certainly within our riding, and in many, many ridings that I've talked to, presidents do not feel they were consulted.”
Such internal bickering wouldn't normally concern non-Liberals. But opponents say it all runs contrary to the type of open, transparent, consensus-type decision-making that Trudeau promised during the 2013 Liberal leadership race, and which they promised to bring to government during last year's federal election.
The proposed changes also come as the Liberal government is moving to dismantle the first-past-the-post electoral system, and replace it with something else. Opposition parties have alleged the Liberals plan to introduce a system that would favour them.
We need to be courageous and we need to show, once again, that the Liberal party is not afraid to challenge the status quo.
“I think it's revealing to the public, in a meaningful way, if they are ramming through a constitution that centralizes power and money without consultation, and then using heavy-handed tactics to get it supported,” said Jennifer Pollock, a Liberal delegate from Calgary who opposes the changes.
“If they're willing to do that to their own members, then I don't think that bodes well for governing.”
The proposed constitutional amendments will be voted on Saturday, with the results announced at the end of the Winnipeg convention. The party will need two-thirds of votes to be in favour for the changes to be adopted. The vote will be held in public, though opponents have called for it to be done in secret.
Both sides are mustering their forces to fight tooth and nail. The party has been calling delegates to gauge support, and posted endorsements from Trudeau and other people online. Opponents have also made websites, and say they plan to have a “war room” at the convention to organize opposition to the proposals.
The degree of opposition is difficult to gauge. Addison says they have seen a growing sense of discomfort in recent days with what the leadership is trying to do. But Bird suggested opposition was “thin.”
“It's coming from a group of Liberals who may be well-intentioned,” Bird said, “but are missing the fundamental importance of these changes in terms of how the party operates and if it's going to operate successfully as we move forward.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A leading U.S. doctors group has endorsed using marijuana for medical purposes, urging the government to roll back a prohibition on using it to treat patients and supporting studies into its medical applications.

The American College of Physicians, the second-largest doctors group in the United States, issued a policy statement on medical marijuana this week after it was approved by its governing body, the group said on Friday.
The group cited evidence that marijuana is valuable in treating severe weight loss associated with AIDS, and nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy in cancer patients.
“Additional research is needed to clarify marijuana's therapeutic properties and determine standard and optimal doses and routes of delivery. Unfortunately, research expansion has been hindered by a complicated federal approval process, limited availability of research-grade marijuana and the debate over legalization,” the group said.
The Philadelphia-based group, founded in 1915, is made up of 124,000 doctors who treat adults.
“The richness of modern medicine is to carefully evaluate new treatments. Marijuana has been in a special category because of, I suppose, its abuses and other concerns,” Dr. David Dale, the group's president and a University of Washington professor of medicine, said in a phone interview.
‘SCIENCE SHOULD BE KEPT OPEN'
David Murray, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy's chief scientist, said, “The science should be kept open. There should be more research. We should continue to investigate.”
The policy statement said, “ACP encourages the use of nonsmoked forms of THC (the main psychoactive element in marijuana) that have proven therapeutic value.” It also backed research into additional therapeutic uses of marijuana.
The government should review marijuana's status as a so-called schedule I controlled substance, alongside such drugs as LSD and heroin, given scientific evidence of its safety and efficacy for some medical conditions, the doctors group said.
It called for exempting doctors who prescribe or dispense medical marijuana in accordance with state law from federal criminal prosecution and other actions. It also urged protection from criminal penalties for patients who use medical marijuana as permitted under state laws.
A dozen states have laws allowing the use of marijuana for medical purposes. But supporters of medical marijuana accuse the federal government of undermining those state laws by having Drug Enforcement Administration agents raid medical marijuana providers.
Rob Kampia, executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project, which urges legal and regulated sales of marijuana, said, “This statement by America's second-largest doctors group demolishes the myth that the medical community doesn't support medical marijuana.”
“The ACP's statement smashes a number of other myths, including the claims that adequate substitutes are available or that marijuana is unsafe for medical use,” Kampia added.
Why don't honest journalists take on Roger Ailes and Fox News?
By Howell Raines
Sunday, March 14, 2010; B05
One question has tugged at my professional conscience throughout the year-long congressional debate over health-care reform, and it has nothing to do with the public option, portability or medical malpractice. It is this: Why haven't America's old-school news organizations blown the whistle on Roger Ailes, chief of Fox News, for using the network to conduct a propaganda campaign against the Obama administration -- a campaign without precedent in our modern political history?
Through clever use of the Fox News Channel and its cadre of raucous commentators, Ailes has overturned standards of fairness and objectivity that have guided American print and broadcast journalists since World War II. Yet, many members of my profession seem to stand by in silence as Ailes tears up the rulebook that served this country well as we covered the major stories of the past three generations, from the civil rights revolution to Watergate to the Wall Street scandals. This is not a liberal-versus-conservative issue. It is a matter of Fox turning reality on its head with, among other tactics, its endless repetition of its uber-lie: "The American people do not want health-care reform."
Fox repeats this as gospel. But as a matter of historical context, usually in short supply on Fox News, this assertion ranks somewhere between debatable and untrue.
The American people and many of our great modern presidents have been demanding major reforms to the health-care system since the administration of Teddy Roosevelt. The elections of 1948, 1960, 1964, 2000 and 2008 confirm the point, with majorities voting for candidates supporting such change. Yet congressional Republicans have managed effective campaigns against health-care changes favored variously by Presidents Truman, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Clinton. Now Fox News has given the party of Lincoln a free ride with its repetition of the unexamined claim that today's Republican leadership really does want to overhaul health care -- if only the effort could conform to Mitch McConnell's ideas on portability and tort reform.
It is true that, after 14 months of Fox's relentless pounding of President Obama's idea of sweeping reform, the latest Gallup poll shows opinion running 48 to 45 percent against the current legislation. Fox invariably stresses such recent dips in support for the legislation, disregarding the majorities in favor of various individual aspects of the reform effort. Along the way, the network has sold a falsified image of the professional standards that developed in American newsrooms and university journalism departments in the last half of the 20th century.
Whatever its shortcomings, journalism under those standards aspired to produce an honest account of social, economic and political events. It bore witness to a world of dynamic change, as opposed to the world of Foxian reality, whose actors are brought on camera to illustrate a preconceived universe as rigid as that of medieval morality. Now, it is precisely our long-held norms that cripple our ability to confront Fox's journalism of perpetual assault. I'm confident that many old-schoolers are too principled to appear on the network, choosing silence over being used; when Fox does trot out a house liberal as a punching bag, the result is a parody of reasoned news formats.
My great fear, however, is that some journalists of my generation who once prided themselves on blowing whistles and afflicting the comfortable have also been intimidated by Fox's financial power and expanding audience, as well as Ailes's proven willingness to dismantle the reputation of anyone who crosses him. (Remember their ridiculing of one early anchor, Paula Zahn, as inferior to a "dead raccoon" in ratings potential when they dared defect to CNN?) It's as if we have surrendered the sword of verifiable reportage and bought the idea that only "elites" are interested in information free of partisan poppycock.
Why has our profession, through its general silence -- or only spasmodic protest -- helped Fox legitimize a style of journalism that is dishonest in its intellectual process, untrustworthy in its conclusions and biased in its gestalt? The standard answer is economics, as represented by the collapse of print newspapers and of audience share at CBS, NBC and ABC. Some prominent print journalists are now cheering Rupert Murdoch, the head of News Corp. (which owns the Fox network) for their alleged commitment to print, as evidenced by their willingness to lose money on the New York Post and gamble the overall profitability of their company on the survival of the Wall Street Journal. This is like congratulating museums for preserving antique masterpieces while ignoring their predatory methods of collecting.
Why can't American journalists steeped in the traditional values of their profession be loud and candid about the fact that Murdoch does not belong to our team? Their importation of the loose rules of British tabloid journalism, including blatant political alliances, started our slide to quasi-news. Their British papers famously promoted Margaret Thatcher's political career, with the expectation that they would open the nation's airwaves to Murdoch's cable channels. Ed Koch once told me they could not have been elected mayor of New York without the boosterism of the New York Post.
As for Fox's campaign against the Obama administration, perhaps the only traditional network star to put Ailes on the spot, at least a little, has been their friend, the venerable Barbara Walters, who was hosting This Week, ABC's Sunday morning talk show. More accurately, they allowed another guest, Arianna Huffington, to belabor Ailes recently about their biased coverage of Obama. Ailes countered that they should be judged as a producer of ratings rather than a journalist -- audience is their only yardstick. While true as far as it goes, this hair-splitting defense purports to absolve Ailes of responsibility for creating a news department whose raison d'etre is to dictate the outcome of our nation's political discourse.
For the first time since the yellow journalism of a century ago, the United States has a major news organization devoted to the promotion of one political party. And let no one be misled by occasional spurts of criticism of the GOP on Fox. In a bygone era of fact-based commentary typified, left to right, by my late colleagues Scotty Reston and Bill Safire, these deceptions would have been given their proper label: disinformation.
Under the pretense of correcting a Democratic bias in news reporting, Fox has accomplished something that seemed impossible before Ailes imported to the news studio the tricks they learned in Richard Nixon's campaign think tank: They and their video ferrets have intimidated center-right and center-left journalists into suppressing conclusions -- whether on health-care reform or other issues -- they once would have stated as demonstrably proven by their reporting. I try not to believe that this kid-gloves handling amounts to self-censorship, but it's hard to ignore the evidence. News Corp., with 64,000 employees worldwide, receives the tender treatment accorded a future employer.
In defending Glenn Beck on ABC, Ailes described them as something like Fox's political id, rather than its whole personality. It is somehow fitting, then, that Sigmund Freud's great-grandson, Matthew Freud, might help put mainstream American journalism back in touch with its collective superego.
This year, Freud, a public relations executive in London and Murdoch's son-in-law, condemned Ailes in an interview with the New York Times, saying they were "ashamed and sickened by Roger Ailes's horrendous and sustained disregard" of proper journalistic standards. Meanwhile, Gabriel Sherman, writing in New York magazine, suggests that Freud and other Murdoch relatives think Ailes has outlived their usefulness -- despite the fact that Fox, with its $700 million annual profit, finances News Corp.'s ability to keep its troubled newspapers and their skeleton staffs on life support. I know some observers of journalistic economics who believe that such insider comments mean Rupert already has Roger on the skids.
It is true that any executive's tenure in the House of Murdoch is situational. But grieve not for Roger Ailes. Their new contract signals that when the winds of televised demagoguery abate, they will waft down on a golden parachute. By News Corp. standards, they deserve it. After all, Ailes helped make Murdoch the most powerful media executive in the United States.
As for Fox News, lots of people who know better are keeping quiet about what to call it. Its news operation can, in fact, be called many things, but reporters of my generation, with memories and keyboards, dare not call it journalism.

Enlarge Mold can be found around some ducts in the barracks of the Wounded Transitional Unit at Fort Sill, Okla. Some soldiers say they have been affected by air in their rooms. WARRIOR TRANSITION UNIT WARRIOR TRANSITION UNIT LAWTON, Okla.  Mold infests the barracks that were set up here a year ago for wounded soldiers after poor conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center triggered a systemwide overhaul, soldiers say. Twenty soldiers, who spoke to USA TODAY early last week, said their complaints about mold and other problems went unheeded for months. They also said they had been ordered not speak about the conditions at Fort Sill. Officers at the Army base last week ordered that ventilation ducts in two barracks be replaced and soldiers be surveyed, anonymously if they wished, about any concerns. Maj. Gen. Peter Vangjel, the commanding officer, said it was "inappropriate" for soldiers to be ordered not to talk about the mold. "We're going in and we're going to take care of this for these guys," they said over the weekend. Images of mold growing on walls of wounded-soldier bedrooms at Walter Reed last year, along with issues of bureaucratic delays in health care, led to an overhaul of the Army's wounded-care system. Warrior Transition Units (WTU) were created to expedite the care and treatment of wounded and ailing soldiers. Army commanders testified before Congress on July 22 that the population of wounded and ailing soldiers in the units had doubled from 6,000 to 12,000 since the program's inception in June 2007, straining resources at several installations. Col. Robert Bridgford, garrison commander at Fort Sill, said they ordered workers last week to replace ventilation ducts encrusted with mold in two 48-room wounded-soldier barracks at the base. About 70 of the 142 patients who are part of the unit for wounded and ailing troops at Fort Sill live in the barracks, said Col. Ellen Forster, who oversees the WTU program. The soldiers are temporarily relocated during the repair work. LEADERS: Army defends oversight of soldier care unit Early last week, soldiers told USA TODAY that in April they first noticed what looked like layers of mold in flexible air ducts above their rooms when ventilation covers were removed to be cleaned. "(The duct work) was just caked black," said Sgt. Willard Barnett, 51, an Iraq war veteran. Some soldiers said they have been affected by air in their rooms. "When I wake up in the morning, I have crud in my eyes, and I have like this slimy phlegm in the back of my throat," said Spc. James Dodson, 26. Vangjel and Forster said they were unaware of any complaints in April. Bridgford said that Aug. 8 lab tests, taken in response to a July 25 inspector general's review, show the barracks have "common mold" that is not hazardous. They also said some vents were cleaned earlier this year. Forster, a nurse who commands the Fort Sill hospital, told WTU soldiers Friday that the barracks are safe.

When AMD's Kaveri APU debuted in January, it offered markedly better performance at lower TDPs but only a modest improvement in top-end performance. Our follow-up analysis indicated that much of the gains that the Steamroller CPU offered were concentrated in its faster connection with the graphics core — meaning that HSA could offer the best overall performance gains. Now, AMD is finally taking the wraps off the mobile, laptop version of the architecture — and it looks like these new chips will be significantly faster than the APUs they replace. AMD's new mobile Kaveri is based on the same silicon as the desktop part which means it includes support for TrueAudio, Mantle, and AMD's unique heterogeneous computing framework, HSA. The company is introducing a new line up of chips from 17W to 35W TDP, with 19W as the primary focus. The complete table of new laptop chips is shown below: High-end 35W parts will now carry the FX brand with clock speeds of up to 2.7GHz base, 3.6GHz turbo, 512 GPU cores, and a 686MHz GPU clock, while the 19W parts will combine a 2.1GHz base clock and 3.3GHz turbo mode with six GPU CUs (384 cores) and a 533MHz clock speed. So how much of a boost is that compared to current models? Let's take a look. AMD's top-end FX-7600P is 200MHz faster (base and turbo clock) than the A10-5757M, but its GPU goes from 384 to 512 cores with only a modest drop in maximum clock (686MHz, down from 720MHz). At lower TDPs, the gains are higher — the FX-7500 has a base clock of 2.1GHz compared to 1.7GHz for the old A8-5545M, with a top-end frequency of 3.3GHz compared to the old 2.7GHz. Core counts between the GPUs are the same, but the GCN parts should be significantly faster than the VLIW4 hardware they replace. The FX-7500's CPU, in other words, should be roughly 20% faster than the old A8-5545M, while the GPU could easily pick up that much performance thanks to its GCN architecture and support for DDR3-1600 (up from DDR3-1333). Combined, these improvements should give AMD a significant performance advantage over its older 19W parts. AMD is claiming up to 11 hours of battery life in e-book reader mode, 9.2 hours in web browsing, and performance increases in OpenCL-accelerated applications Those gains are against the A10-5845M on the left and the Core i5-4200 on the right. Presumably this is an OpenCL-friendly task; AMD tends to struggle in most Photoshop workloads when put head-to-head with Intel in CPU tests. Even measured against its own predecessor, however, the gains are significant.
Can it match Haswell?
AMD has chosen to compare against the Core i5 and Core i7 families, which is a step up for the company, which historically shies away from such comparison. On the other hand, it's comparing in an application that heavily favors AMD's OpenCL acceleration (PCMark), a 3D gaming suite, and an OpenCL computation program (Basemark). None of these are bad applications, per se, but they don't give a full comparison on the relative state of performance between Intel and AMD. Still, there is reason to be hopeful that this chip can improve AMD's low-power performance against its principal rival. First, no matter what else, we know that the new 19W parts are significantly faster than the old chips just based on clock speed. Second, there's the fact that AMD is positioning its own quad-cores against Intel dual-core parts (a requirement given the relative single-thread performance disparity between the chips). Third and finally, the AMD cores target much higher base clocks — the Core i5-4200U is a 1.6GHz/2.6GHz chip going up against AMD's FX-7500 at 2.1GHz/3.3GHz. Yes, AMD prefers to put that core up against a Core i7-4500, but I'm a bit more realistic. Put them all together, and AMD has a better chance of matching Intel in the mobile sphere than it's been able to offer for several years. Exact performance comparisons will have to wait for shipping hardware, but the improvements here year-on-year are significant. Hopefully we'll see them shipping into hardware — mostly mid-budget laptops with half-decent gaming chops — in time for the back to school schedule.
Obama Chuckles At D.C. 'Snow Day'
President Obama took a moment Wednesday to comment on how the nation's capital handles bad weather. They joked about bringing "flinty Chicago toughness" to Washington, D.C.
ROBERT SIEGEL, host:
More now on that much remarked on wintry weather in the capital today. The ice and freezing rain in Washington, D.C. closed 447 schools in the area. And this puzzled our new president who has just moved their family in from the Windy City.
President BARACK OBAMA: My children's school was canceled today because of - what?
Unidentified Woman: Ice.
(Soundbite of laughter)
President OBAMA: Some ice?
(Soundbite of laughter)
Unidentified Man: ...as Chicago.
(Soundbite of laughter)
President OBAMA: As my children pointed out, in Chicago, school is never canceled.
(Soundbite of laughter)
President OBAMA: In fact, my seven year old pointed out that you'd go outside for recess on a day like this.
(Soundbite of laughter)
President OBAMA: You wouldn't even stay indoors. So, it's - I don't know, we're going to have to try to apply some flinty Chicago toughness to this town.
(Soundbite of laughter)
President OBAMA: I'm saying when it comes to the weather, folks in Washington don't seem to be able to handle things.
MICHELE NORRIS, host:
Well, welcome to Washington, Mr. President. Though we note that the District of Columbia public schools were open today, though, they started two hours late.

German carmaker BMW hinted it is prepared to move production of the Mini out of the UK if Britain's negotiations to leave the European Union leads to trade barriers.
BMW chief executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker was preparing for "different scenarios" depending on the outcome of the UK's Brexit talks with the EU.
Carmakers fear the introduction of export tariffs between the European bloc and Britain, making vehicle production in the UK expensive.
Car production is a crucial part of the UK economy, accounting for sales of just under £72bn last year and employing 814,000 workers, according to trade body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
BMW's main factory for the Mini is in Oxford – in addition, the carmaker also has plants in Goodwood and Hams Hall, in Warwickshire.
The group, which also owns Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, employs around 18,000 in Britain and exports about £2.4bn of cars and parts from the UK.
BMW's Krueger, speaking earlier this week at the firm's Munich headquarters, said: "The UK remains an important location for us. Much will depend on how Brexit is ultimately negotiated.
"At the BMW Group, we are preparing for different scenarios. Our production network offers us flexibility. Mini models are also built at VDL Nedcar in Born in the Netherlands."
Investment fears
Last week Toyota announced it will invest £240m to upgrade its Burnaston plant, as carmakers continue to dominate the government's thinking ahead of Brexit talks, which British Prime Minister Theresa May said they will trigger on 29 March.
French company PSA agreed a £1.9bn deal to buy General Motors' loss-making European unit, including Vauxhall earlier this month, raising fears of job losses at Vauxhall plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton.
Reports have also suggested, this month, that Ford could lay off more than 1,100 workers at its engine plant in Bridgend by 2021.
Last October Japanese carmaker Nissan cast doubt over future investment in the UK as a result of the UK's Brexit vote.
Secret deals
But, after a meeting with the government, the firm decided to build its next-generation Qashqai and add production of the new X-Trail model at Britain's biggest car plant, securing more than 7,000 jobs and 28,000 more in the supply chain.
Nissan's boss, Carlos Ghosn, said the company's decision was driven by government "support and reassurances".
The details of the meeting have never been disclosed, but the government denies it cut the carmaker a special deal.
Perhaps it's appropriate that news of President Duterte's green light for the rehabilitation of the mothballed Bataan Nuclear Power Plant (BNPP) came in the midst of the public outrage over the Supreme Court's upholding of the planned burial of the dictator Ferdinand Marcos' remains in the Libingan ng mga Bayani. If there is an enduring symbol, after all, of the staggering plunder that marked the Marcos regime, the concrete monstrosity sitting on 389 hectares of the coastline in Morong, Bataan, more than qualifies.
From the beginning, the BNPP was a magnet of corruption and mismanagement. When Marcos decided to develop nuclear power in the wake of the 1973 oil shock, two international energy companies came forward with their proposals: General Electric with a highly detailed $700-million project bid, and Westinghouse with a lower bid of $500 million that was said to be curiously short on specifications.

Marcos chose Westinghouse nevertheless. Construction of the plant began in 1976, and by 1984 the project cost had ballooned to P2.3 billion, funded by foreign creditors. After Marcos' ouster in 1986, President Cory Aquino's administration decided to scrap the plant based on a host of safety and environmental concerns. The Philippines would spend the next 30 years paying off the BNPP debt, representing its biggest international credit obligation for over a generation.
Why did the cost skyrocket by as much as 400 percent? Primarily because Marcos and their cronies saw in the project another means to enrich themselves. Up to $80 million was reportedly forked over in kickbacks by Westinghouse; Marcos was said to have received their share through their crony Herminio Disini. According to a report in The New York Times, Disini's commission was “5 percent of the value of Westinghouse's part of the project” and “Marcos was to get 95 percent of Disini's fee.” So flush with cash was Disini that they were able to buy a castle for themselves in Vienna. In 2012, the Sandiganbayan ordered them to return $50.6 million in commissions that they amassed from the project.
Because the power plant's construction was riddled with malfeasance from the start, the end result was as rotten. An inquiry would reveal that the BNPP was the height of shoddy construction, built over geologically unstable land and with over 4,000 defects. While its promise of 621 megawatts of electricity would have benefited only about 15 percent of Luzon's population then, the risks were outsize: The 1979 Three Mile Island meltdown in the United States, and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Russia, had shown that even the most technologically advanced countries in the world struggled against the overwhelming dangers of a nuclear accident.
The Fukushima incident in 2011, in which Japan also had to deal with deadly radioactive fallout following an earthquake and tsunami, once again underlined the dangers of a nuke plant accident. Japan, an industrial powerhouse, continues to deal with the aftereffects of that devastation—a 20-mile exclusion zone, for one, that has turned once-thriving communities into no man's land. A recent report also says Fukushima radiation continues to leak into and contaminate the Pacific Ocean, five years later.
What would possess the President to consider reviving the BNPP, given its sordid history, its plethora of risks, and the enormous estimated rehabilitation cost of $1 billion? What studies, if any, were commissioned before the policy decision to reactivate the plant was made? Or is this another of the President's gut decisions, made without adequate consultation with their Cabinet and the proper experts in the field? They have indicated they want to revive such other Marcos-era hallmarks as the Philippine Constabulary and even, alarmingly, the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. This nuclear plant built by Marcos would not be out of place in that lineup—but only at the expense, once again, of the Filipino people.

Women who are just divorced can stare at their wedding dress and cry.
Or, the divorcee and their gal pals can have fun shooting up the dress with an M1919 Browning machine gun.
That's the marketing strategy behind a Valentine's Day promotion called “Just Divorced” rolled out by Machine Guns Vegas, a firearms tourist attraction in an industrial neighborhood off Spring Mountain Road, a short shuttle ride from the Strip.
“There's divorce parties all over the Strip. But there are other ways besides alcohol to put your past behind you,” said Megan Fazio, president of Neon Public Relations, who created the business promotion for Machine Guns Vegas.
“On a day when a lot of people are happy about their relationships, if I was divorced that would be the day I'd want to blow up my wedding dress,” Fazio said.
“I know a lot of people who have been divorced who would do this.”
Actually, the $499 Just Divorced package is designed for both women and men, allowing the uncoupled to shoot any item related to their marriage or wedding with a .30 caliber shot, the largest available at Machine Guns Vegas.
Marriage certificate? Love letter? Engagement party invitation? Leftover wedding cake?
Bring it on.
But Genghis Cohen, owner of Machine Guns Vegas, does draw the line.
No pictures of former spouses allowed for target practice.
“They're not allowed to shoot a picture. They can do it privately, but if a nut job shoots a husband or wife in the light of day, we don't want to be involved in a lawsuit,” said Cohen, whose first name is really Genghis and was given that name because their father admired Genghis Khan.
Cohen said the business promotion comes down to statistics, noting that 315 couples tie the knot daily in Las Vegas. If the divorce rate is 50 percent, that's 157.5 couples that are going to eventually split up and be available to sign up for the Valentine's Day machine gun special.
“At the end of the day, people are getting divorced,” said Cohen, a native New Zealander who has been divorced once. “When they shoot a gun, there is a release of anger.”
The $499 buys 40 rounds from the M1919, 10 rounds on a black or pink M4 for up to four friends each, free transportation from the Strip and free space in a VIP lounge where you can celebrate with cake, snacks and nonalcoholic beverages.
The M1919 is a popular machine gun used in dozens of movies, from “The War of the Worlds” in 1953 to “Fury” in 2014. It can be mounted on planes, tanks and tripods and has a rate of fire of 400-600 rounds per minute.
The promotion starts Feb. 14 and runs for an unlimited time, Cohen said. The promotion is new, and no one has yet signed up for the Just Divorced special.
They also have a message for those who might be offended by the Just Divorced deal.
“If you're bothered by it, don't do it,” Fazio said.
Machine Guns Vegas, which caters mostly to tourists, does not sell guns or ammunition. The facility does host weddings.
“We facilitate all levels of love here,” Cohen said.

The City of Vancouver says a hotel that is rented monthly by low-income residents is so unsafe that it's evacuating the building because it's at risk of collapsing.
A news release from the city says its chief building official has deemed the 176-room Balmoral Hotel in the Downtown Eastside unfit for occupation because of structural and fire concerns and tenants must be relocated by June 12.
It says the building owners have maintained unacceptable conditions for decades, causing significant problems for police and the city.
The city has now ordered the owners to immediately begin repairs, once the tenants are out or be charged for costs if they don't comply.
A long time resident showed what living conditions are like inside the Balmoral Hotel. 1:13
While it's the owners' legal obligation to support tenants who must be relocated, the city says municipal and provincial governments, along with Vancouver Coastal Health, advocates and community groups will help people find alternative housing.
Currently over 150 violations at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BalmoralHotel?src=hash">#BalmoralHotel</a> says <a href="https://twitter.com/CityofVancouver">@CityofVancouver</a> <a href="https://t.co/PHvrXIIY1O">pic.twitter.com/PHvrXIIY1O</a> —@tinalovgreen
The city says an engineering firm retained by the owners last month suggested water damage and rot have compromised the building, though it's hoping the Balmoral can be fixed to provide a critical source of affordable housing.

Tenants 'hung out to dry'
Carnegie Community Action Project spokesperson Wendy Pedersen believes the city is taking the wrong approach — and that it comes after months of neglect.
"Shelters are a slippery slope until life-threatening crises in people's lives. They're already under served, under protected, extremely vulnerable people. I don't think they'll want to go to a shelter," they said.

"They haven't backed up the community. They haven't backed up the tenants. And now they're hung out to dry."
However, deputy city manager Paul Mochrie said it was impossible for them to make the improvements necessary to the building without temporarily evicting the tenants.
"These are people that have had to endure some truly atrocious living conditions and are now subject to displacement from their homes on extremely short notice," they said.
"We're extremely frustrated this is the situation we find ourselves in and they find themselves in. Unfortunately, given the safety information we've received, we simply have no choice. The risk to those tenants is too great."

How many times have you driven past the mammoth building that sits between Ponce de Leon Avenue and North Avenue in Midtown across the street from the Krispy Kreme and wondered just what goes on in there?
Some know that the Ponce de Leon Center is one of the largest, most comprehensive facilities dedicated to the treatment of advanced HIV/AIDS in the United States.
Some know that the Ponce de Leon Center, which was founded in 1986, serves about 5,000 patients each year.
Some know that the Ponce de Leon Center is part of the Grady Health System and that many of its doctors, nurses and specialists who provide onsite medical, support and community services are affiliated with Emory University.
But many have no idea what goes on inside the large, gray building that they may have driven past a hundred times.
If that's you, take a few minutes to read this January Emory Health feature story from Dana Goldman on the Ponce de Leon Center, where "relationships are at the heart of clinical and research programs for people with HIV."
In addition to the written piece, there's a great video with a patient, who was very open and available to talk, and their doctor.
The video is well worth a peek, too, to see the kind of impact on people's lives that's happening everyday in the big, nondescript building located at 341 Ponce De Leon Ave. in Midtown.
Fournette, Beckham Jr. respond to viral Alabama Banner
TUSCALOOSA - The University of Alabama released a statement Saturday regarding the viral photo that showed Alabama fans displaying a banner that said, "Finish what Katrina Started."
UA's Vice President of Student Affairs, David Grady, took to Twitter Saturday afternoon to ask the people of Tuscaloosa to welcome visitors with respect and good sportsmanship.
Grady's statements also echoed a Friday statement by the university saying that the banner's message does not represent UA, the students or the football team.
LSU running back Leonard Fournette, who experienced the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina first hand in New Orleans, responded to the image on Twitter Friday:
Inspire us to go harder love my savages....... — 7? (@_fournette) November 6, 2015
Former LSU Tiger wide receiver and current New York Giant Odell Beckham Jr. also responded to the image on social media. Beckham posted an image of Fournette on Instagram with the caption, "Katrina never broke us, it made us savages."
Katrina never broke us, it made us savages... @_fournette7 #4ThaCity #Follow A photo posted by Odell Beckham Jr (@iam_objxiii) on Nov 7, 2015 at 10:41am PST
Fournette told News Two earlier this year, they were ten years old when they spent four nights and five days living on an I-10 overpass after the category 3 hurricane caused levee failures that flooded New Orleans.
The city of New Orleans marked the 10 anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's landfall in August.
According to the university, the banner was hung at an off-campus apartment complex and was removed. In a second tweet on Friday, the university's official Twitter account said that UA was appalled that anyone would display a banner with such an inappropriate message.
LSU is not unfamiliar with controversial banners being hung during football games. Last September the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity at LSU made national headlines after hanging a banner during a home football game that mocked openly gay NFL football player Michael Sam.
The DKE fraternity later apologized for the banner and in a letter to LSU President F. King Alexander said that they would refrain from posting similar banners in the future.
The Fruits Themselves.
Hey! Welcome to Bloggers4freedom, I am so happy that you have found me and I hope you enjoy my first post. I grew up in a family that promoted healthy eating. However, they only told me how to eat the same way they were told to eat when they were young; eat your vegetables, do not drink soda, don't eat candy, eat a piece of fruit everyday. You were probably told something similar when you were young as well, which is great until you actually need to lose weight. It turns out that there are some fruits that promote weight loss and other fruits that do not promote weight loss. AKA… just because it is a fruit does not mean it is going to help you lose weight! I love bananas, I would eat them everyday and actually have done so.
Fruits That Promote Weight Loss- Ingredients
Bananas are loaded with potassium and vitamins but they also contain about 15 grams of sugar a piece which is about the same as a chocolate bar. That being true, bananas are not fruits that promote weight loss. Sugar, if eaten the incorrect way, can be so bad for you that people will cut it out of their diet completely. “Sugar Cleanses” as they are frequently called, can be a few day diet change to a permanent diet change. Dr Oz and Ellen DeGeneres have both recommended sugar cleanses and a key to healthier living. Both speak highly of the removal of sugar from their diets. Fortunately, many fruits contain naturally occurring sugars that are not toxic to your body in small quantities. Research has shown that sugar can be addictive. Once you start having a sugary diet, it can be extremely hard to change.
Types Of Fruits That Promote Weight Loss
The fruits that promote weight loss are generally fruits that contain more water and are less dense. However, the most important thing to think about is the portion of fruit. Twenty or thirty blue berries sounds like a lot but it is just a handful and would be very healthy, eating the entire container would leave you with an upset stomach. You could apply the same theory to the banana (only eat half or a quarter of a banana), doing so would allow you to have more options of fruits that promote weight loss. More so, different fruits contain different vitamins and minerals, eating small amounts of a variety of fruits a day will ensure that you lose weight while maintaining the balanced levels of the vitamins that your body needs to function. I suggest you make a low fat fruit salad:
Remove the skin, chop and stir the following ingredients together in a bowl. This recipe makes 4 servings, so add lemon juice to preserve the salad. Eat one serving every morning. 1 Apple 1 pear 2 Grapefruits 2 Oranges
Why Fruits That Promote Weight Loss
Fruits Promote Weight Loss because the body needs vitamins and minerals to survive. Simple fruits can prevent all types of disease from occurring in the body. For example, Sailors in the 18th century would become lethargic, get bumps all over their bodies, lose their teeth and limbs and would eventually die. It was later discovered, the disease, known as scurvy was caused by a simple vitamin C deficiency which can easily be avoided by eating citrus. British sailors began to consume limes on a daily basis to combat this disease which is why they were referred to as limeys. In conclusion the power of fruits is something to marvel. There are fruits that promote weight loss and fruits that stop sailors from a grisly death at sea. As we study fruit we find more and more health benefits and reasons to keep them in our diet, if not make them a major part of our diets.
A judge in the United States has denied attempts by plaintiffs in three BitTorrent mass lawsuits to obtain the identities of individuals behind IP addresses. Chief United States Magistrate Judge Leo T. Sorokin said the plaintiffs had shown no interest in presenting a plan that would identify actual infringers and were instead relying on an action that "..smacks of a bad faith effort to harass the third-party subscriber."
The three lawsuits in question, all presented by the same attorney, follow a familiar pattern. Some time ago the copyright holders in the cases – Discount Video Center and Patrick Collins – gathered IP addresses in BitTorrent swarms that they claim are connected to copyright infringement of their adult content.
Of course, none of the plaintiffs know the identity of the alleged infringers, only the IP addresses in the swarms. This is problematic. While the IP addresses can usually be traced back to a certain ISP account linked to a bill payer, that person is not necessarily the infringer and only infringers can be held liable.
Nevertheless, the plaintiffs embarked on a discovery process in order to replace the original ‘John Does' on the complaint with the names of the ISP account holders, not the actual infringers.
“The Plaintiffs in these cases evidence no interest in [identifying the infringers]. They have not proposed a discovery plan aimed at identifying the infringers they have sued,” writes Chief United States Magistrate Judge Leo T. Sorokin.
“Rather, the Plaintiffs request that the Court order disclosure of the third-party subscribers' names so that the Plaintiffs might settle or dismiss their cases on an informal basis.”
Judge Sorokin goes on to explain that not only will the discovery requested by the plaintiffs fail to identify the actual infringers, but the plaintiffs have failed to request leave to take depositions as they said they would during a hearing earlier in the year.
“[..] The omission of any written request for depositions in the Plaintiffs' renewed motions for discovery speaks volumes about the Plaintiffs' lack of interest in actually litigating these cases,” writes Judge Sorokin.
Then what follows in the ruling is a shining example of how rightsholders have to fish for additional information beyond an IP address in order to identify an actual infringer. The Judge notes that not only did the copyright holders fail to put forward a plan that could do so, but they were not able to explain to the court what information they would need to make that a possibility either.
“Well, I don't think there is a specific set of information we need,” plaintiffs' attorney explained. “I'd like to keep this as least burdensome as possible and as least costly as possible. Opening communications between me and the Does or me and the subscribers is, I think, the best course of action.”
In other words, give me the name of a subscriber and once I have that I'll force them to either pay up, implicate someone else, or suffer an extremely expensive lawsuit. But the Judge was having none of it.
“The Plaintiffs' proposal – i.e., that the Court permit the Plaintiffs to subpoena the names
of the subscribers and that the Court then leave it to the Plaintiffs to figure out the rest pursuant to informal communications – is unacceptable,” they wrote. “The governing case law permits ex parte discovery in the presence of a discovery plan tailored to the identification of the defendants [emphasis ours].
Judge Sorokin also clearly understands that interest in actually taking a named case to court is virtually nil, and that all plaintiffs' are interested in are cash settlements.
“Plaintiff Patrick Collins, Inc. has sued at least 11,570 John Doe Defendants in litigation around the country without ever serving a single defendant,” the Judge wrote.
In the Discount Video case, the Judge also had harsh words. They said that the company had an intent to file a complaint against a Doe, even though it has no idea of the infringer's identity.
“Such an action smacks of a bad faith effort to harass the third-party subscriber by causing them or them to expend further legal fees in a brand-new action, which would merely repeat all that has occurred to date,” they wrote.
“The course of action the Plaintiff has stated it intends to pursue also suggests an improper effort to engage in judge shopping and evidences a disregard for the Court's limited public resources.”
Judge Sorokin concludes with an attack on plaintiffs' tendency to say one thing and then do another, including suing infringers but then informing subscribers that they had been sued, saying they would hold subscribers secondarily liable but then backing away, and then promising to litigate cases but never doing so.
All things considered the Judge concluded by denying the request for ex-parte discovery.

A prominent Montreal chef has broken ranks with la belle province to crown Toronto as Canada's greatest food destination.
David McMillan, chef and co-owner of Montreal's iconic Joe Beef restaurant, called in to CBC Radio's Metro Morning from their hometown to heap praise on Toronto's diverse, lavish restaurant scene and Ontario farm products.
"I've been looking at beef, cheese, chickens, rabbits, lamb, my god," they said. "I want to cook there!"
In a recent column for Foodism magazine, McMillan described taking increasingly frequent trips to the 416 to eat, citing Bar Raval, Bar Isabel, Rodney's, Oyster Boy and the Black Hoof as some personal favourites.
But what about Montreal, home to famous restaurants like Martin Picard's Au Pied de Cochon and Daniel Boulud's upscale Maison Boulud, not to mention enviable cheap eats like smoked meat and poutine?
"There haven't been many new restaurants. As far as competition, there hasn't been much growth," said McMillan.

"I'd say these days it's a hard city to live in. There's definitely corruption, definitely crumbling infrastructure, definitely lots of mismanagement of public funds, but not really incredible growth over the years."
Meanwhile, they said, Toronto has been gaining momentum.
"I'm generally impressed about the wealth and the richness of the restaurants," they said. "It's a really beautiful thing to see."
Instead of listing all the things Trump does wrong, let's talk about what motivates them to do so.
How to Shame the Shameless
Instead of listing all the things Trump does wrong, let's talk about what motivates them to do so.
By Gaige Davila, University of Texas at San Antonio
President Donald Trump lives in breaking news.
Writers, journalists and comedians are fully rationed, replenishing their material with every morning's newspaper. Americans are being graced with exceptional political commentary and satire, but what has changed?
If you measure the resistance of Trump's administration on their awareness to their scandals, then, sure, news and entertainment media are revolutionaries in a sense. Perhaps, for now, it's hard to talk about anything else. Ideally, this much coverage would have brought Trump down, but he's become a cash cow.

Trump's day to day has been turned into an SNL skit, a damning editorial or is debated on cable news all fucking day. All the attention is going to Trump, which is exactly what they want. Press coverage, good and bad, have become synonymous with the ratings he's so familiar with. How does any of this criticism not faze him? Is a different approach needed? I say, no shit.
Every criticism questions their ethics, but Trump is shameless. Approaching someone, or an entire administration, with how unethical they are, when they're well aware of how unethical they are, will fail to instigate change. What the world is facing is the apex of a toxic political culture, one that's lost hope for a system that works, where the majority have become the minority by difference in wealth, rationality is seen as an attempt to cover up the “truth” and violence is the solution to violence (terrorism).
Instead of attempting to show Trump what's wrong with, well, everything he's done, writers, activists, journalists and entertainment media should be paying attention to what causes a Trump presidency. Philosophers, authoritarian regimes and even Hunter S. fucking Thompson have described the conditions that would lead to a reign like Trump's. Though the complications surrounding this presidency couldn't have been predicted, there's a core of conditions that can be seen today. For one, as has been pointed out before, the majority of Trump's support comes from people who got screwed by the economy.
Trade, manual and even service jobs are succumbing to automation, and there's little to stop profit-driven companies to cut costs they deem unnecessary (like employee wages). Those who held these jobs have been losing them for a while, and the blame gets thrown to “the other.” This narrative of immigrants and their native-born families as economy killers isn't new, nor is it something that only happens in the United States. Some undocumented immigrants, however, do take jobs over American citizens, usually for lower wages. That is where the attention should be directed—an economic system that sees people as the difference between one profit and another.
Immigrants are also scapegoated as destroyers of American values. These “destroyers,” as of the last few decades, have been people from Arab nations, specifically believers of Islam. Trump supporters continue pushing for more aggressive responses to terrorist attacks. Trump's promises to annihilate ISIS and proposal of a “travel ban” appealed to a base that had, since September 11, 2001, wanted revenge against people who killed in the name of Islam.
Again, this is not unique to the U.S. During France's presidential elections, Marine Le Pen's abrasive views of Islam attracted a base of voters who were increasingly frustrated over the handling of terrorist attacks. Though these concerns are well founded, the propaganda and generalizations of Islamic culture are not. Increased terrorism-prevention policies sacrifice rights as a cost for security, a mostly bi-partisan issue that Americans wanted to be rid of. Trump, posing as the final solution to stop terror, swallowed these votes.
Fear of “the other” is deeply ingrained in the American psyche. This vulnerability has been taken advantage of by power. Rather than be shocked by its reach, we should question it: Why do we have to sacrifice rights for safety? Why are we continuing to persecute Muslims, or people who “look Muslim,” when nearly all condemn terrorism? Why do business interests of the United States correlate with the countries they war with? And so on.
I'm not saying that attention has not been directed to anything I've referenced. Rather, I'm calling for attention to be taken away from Trump's ethics. The man is immoral, and no amount accountability will be torn out of him. Continuing to cast Trump as a monster, detailing their every move and condemning their actions is necessary, but only as a point of reference. Trump's face is now Big Brother-like in its continued presence, desensitizing any push to remove them from office.
I, too, am guilty of pushing this all away, hoping Trump will soon fuck up so hard that he's impeached by the next morning. Even those who are immediately affected by their actions are losing hope in trying to fight against him. However, there has been progress, and it's by the same people who I said were doing it all wrong.

Investigations into Trump's contact with the Russian government, unethical business ties and absurd policy proposals are all by journalists looking at a government that so many believed would never allow this presidency to happen.
Late night show hosts like Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers are exposing this administration's absurdity satirically, getting people to pay attention to pay politics who otherwise wouldn't. John Oliver, host of “Last Week Tonight,” has provided regular, in-depth coverage to the systems Trump takes advantage of. Though having every show like “Last Week Tonight” would stagnate television, it's a sound model on how satire can explicate political culture.
These shows are not enough, however. America has a clear danger to its democracy, and some of Trump's damage may be irreversible. The systems that have broken so many still remain and will continue if more attention is given to Trump. If, and when, this all ends, Americans must remember the aftershock. Several precedents have been set, whether intentionally or not, and America's current circus of a political culture must not continue after the ringleader is gone.
“We did lose a couple of players, but the guys that stayed, we told them, ‘You're going to be able to really do something really different here,' ” Pitino said from their current perch in Louisville. “ ‘Every night you play, you're going to be in what feels like a tournament game.' And that I think is what Bill O'Brien can tell their players: every game is going to be your bowl game.”
Whether Penn State should be playing football next season on television, or at all, is another debatable matter but not the reality for O'Brien and their players any more than the guilty-as-charged evil of Jerry Sandusky and the alleged negligence of Paterno are their responsibility.
“You feel sorry for yourself and you say: Why are we being punished?” said Deron Feldhaus, one of the players who carried on with Pitino. “But my dad had played at Kentucky. I had also been redshirted my first-year student year so I would have had to sit out a year had we transferred. And I also knew that by my senior year we would have a chance to play in the tournament again, so all of us in that class put a lot on that.”
O'Brien could be cutting and pasting to field a team next season but will no doubt be pitching a similar plan by next year to potential recruits: redshirt a year, help lead us back to bowl prominence by the time you're a junior. The forecasts of a decade or more of football misery at Penn State may be overstating the case in a college sports culture that is primarily defined by continuous change.
With the understanding that basketball requires fewer players to form a competitive team, Pitino did not experience so much as a losing season at Kentucky, going 14-14 in 1989-90 with a core of the asupervisorstioned in-state players — Feldhaus, Richie Farmer and John Pelphrey — and Sean Woods, a point guard from Indianapolis.

But more than the ability of that team to tread water, Feldhaus recalled the sense of appreciation and relief over the mere opportunity to carry on.
“The games weren't on TV that first year, so everyone wanted to come out,” they said in a telephone interview. “And the crowds, I don't know, they just seemed louder that season than they'd ever been.”

Without touching on transgressions, Pitino noted the emotional similarities to their and O'Brien's first-year circumstances, if only because Kentucky basketball is every bit the state passion that Penn State football has been to a large part of Pennsylvania.

“I remember the Sports Illustrated cover with a kid in uniform with their back to the reader and the headline, ‘Kentucky's Shame,' ” Pitino said. “That was pretty much how everyone there felt, kind of humiliated.”
Do students and alumni fuel the bonfires of impropriety with their unbridled passion? Are sports too ingrained in the university psyche? We can argue all that and lecture the masses on how we are long overdue on scaling it all back.
But let's be honest: running parallel to the coverage of the Penn State nightmare has been the collective news media crusade for a football tournament that would only bring more television money into the pool, escalate the arms race in the hysterical quest to be No. 1 and further empower the coaches who wind up in control of the institutional hedge fund of ethics.
During Pitino's long career, their celebrity fortunes have soared to the top and on one occasion scraped the bottom, but when asked to rank their most gratifying experiences, they cited two that were inextricably tied to personal feelings and overachievement: their upstart Providence team reaching the 1987 Final Four soon after the death of a young son and their first Kentucky teams that pushed up from where there was no place else to go.
In their second season at Kentucky, upgraded with a new recruiting class, Pitino coached a team that went 22-6 but still could not play in the N.C.A.A. tournament. In Year 3, Kentucky made the East Regional final, losing to Duke on Christian Laettner's buzzer beater in one of sport's most memorable games.
More than that, Pitino said they relished the ceremonial satisfaction of watching the jerseys of that team's four seniors — Feldhaus, Pelphrey, Farmer and Woods — soon after raised to the rafters at Rupp Arena.
“When I first got to Kentucky I was an outsider, and I didn't understand how deep the wounds were and what it meant to those people,” they said. “I had tears in my eyes watching those jerseys go up there, and I think that's when I finally got it.”
Those seniors — known in Kentucky as the Unforgettables — helped peeled away for a short time the layers of ostentation that have bloated big-time college sports. At Penn State, there is no choice but to get smaller and think smaller. Given the somewhat grotesque feeding frenzy the N.C.A.A. has sanctioned, players have every right to leave to play for a national title or simply on a team not staggered by scandal.
There are no guarantees anywhere, but those who stay may discover there are rewards to downscaling they never would have imagined.
SACRAMENTO (CBS SF) — Along with alcohol, cigarettes and pet food, low-income parents are banned from using food stamps to buy diapers, leaving many families struggling to pay the estimated $100 a month it costs for the basic necessity.
California Assemblywoman and single mother Lorena Gonzalez wants to change that thanks to some inspiration from rapper Eminem.
“Cause man, these food stamps don't buy diapers,” they rap in a song.
There's truth in that statement, inspiring the Democrat from San Diego to create a bill that would give qualifying families in the CalWork's welfare program $80 a month to spend on diapers for children under age 2.
No U.S. welfare program currently covers the cost of diapers.
“We know the number one barrier to moms going back to the workforce is childcare,” Gonzalez said. “If you don't have an adequate supply of diapers and can't take your child to child care there's no way you can get a job.”
Principal consultant Jolie Onodera told the Sacramento Bee the bill would impact more than 120,000 children in the state if it were to pass.
But Republicans are knocking the bill down, stressing the $100 million annual cost to taxpayers for a short-term solution.
“Instead of expanding our welfare system and keeping millions dependent upon government, we should implement business-friendly policies enabling those out of work to obtain a job and provide for their families,” Republican Assemblywoman Shannon Grove from Bakersfield said in an email statement to the Bee.
“They shouldn't keep having babies if they can't afford diapers,” said Tara Riley, who supports the bill — just not the decision to have more children if you can't afford it.
Advocates for the bill disagree, saying parents can't hold a job if they can't send their children to daycare, which require a day's worth of disposable diapers.
AB 1516 already passed out of the California Assembly and is now on its way to the state Senate Committee on Appropriations where it awaits a vote.
The memorandum of understanding was signed in Tokyo on Thursday by Hiroshige Seko, the Japanese trade and industry minister, and Greg Clark, the business and energy secretary.
The agreement is the first of its kind for Japan, while Mr Clark described it as "vital" to the UK's industrial strategy and the development of clean energy sources.
One of the key components of the agreement is the proposals by Hitachi and Toshiba to build new reactors in Britain.
Horizon Nuclear Power, bought by Hitachi from a German company in 2012, has delivered the outline of a project at Wylfa Newydd in Wales, and has plans to build as many as six reactors in the UK. Toshiba joint venture NuGeneration is planning a nuclear plant in Cumbria and is considering additional projects.
Speaking in Tokyo last week, Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, said: "The technology is proven and well-known. Hitachi and Toshiba have the technology. The challenge really is financing, not a technical or commercial challenge."
0 Frustrated UPS customers say they won't get packages in time for Christmas
CLAYTON COUNTY, Ga. - Some customers said they are dealing with a holiday shipping nightmare after they paid for service they won't get in time for Christmas.
Disgruntled customers said they stood in line for hours Saturday at the UPS customer service center in Forest Park waiting for packages or answers from the company.
"Unfortunately for us, our package was on the truck last night. They had some problems, some mixups delivering the package, and it went back with the driver. So we stood out here and didn't get what we came for," customer Ronald Fears said.
Customers said they got the runaround from UPS about packages they were told would be delivered but never showed up.
"There were about 75 of us in this one little room, you know, trying to get our stuff. Everybody was saying the same thing," customer Devonte Hammond said. "There were so many different stories, and everyone was telling us multiple things that really weren't true."
TRENDING STORIES:
Many customers said they won't get their packages until after Christmas.
Hammond said they operate a small clothing business, but won't be able to get merchandise out to their customers.
"I have a couple of kids who want hoodies and T-shirts because they saw their parents with it and they want it before Christmas, and UPS kind of messed that up for them," they said.
Earlier this week, UPS said “the vast majority of UPS shipments are being delivered in accordance with the published time in transit.”
Hammond said UPS representatives were unapologetic.
“No I'm sorry. It was pretty much like you order it you're gonna have to wait until Tuesday.”
UPS sent a statement Saturday night saying, "UPS delivered throughout the day and into the evening tonight in the Atlanta area, where we've brought in 'ready teams' of additional employees to help."

It has been just over a year since the Hillary Clinton camp, so confident that it would steamroll into the White House, was, instead, crushed by then-candidate Donald Trump. Reading about the Clinton team's various exploits during the last year, one may be thankful that they are not running the country.
Here is what seven of the people who wanted to take America's reins are up to now:
Hillary Clinton
The woman who once claimed that questioning the legitimacy of the election was “horrifying” has spent much of the last year questioning the legitimacy of the election. After a lengthy tour in which they blamed an exhaustive list of people/events/countries for their failure (and repeated ad nauseam the same joke about drinking Chardonnay), they launched their campaign post-mortem, What Happened.
The 500-page book reads less like a sober analysis of the campaign from a seasoned political veteran and more like the pained ramblings of a bitter loser who preferred to blame everything from Russia to misogyny for them defeat. After the book launched, they went on another book tour, where they continued to question the legitimacy of the election. To quote Mrs. Clinton herself, it's “horrifying.”
Now, with the 2010 Uranium One scandal back in center stage, and congressional lawmakers eyeing investigations, Hillary's 2018 may not be much better than them 2017.
Bill Clinton
Just more than a year since left-wing pundits were salivating over having a former president back in the White House as a first husband, Bill's once-untouchable record among Democrats is undergoing some serious re-evaluation. Bill's record in office came under surprise scrutiny during the 2016 campaign as Black Lives Matter activists protested against their measures to crack down on crime and drugs in the 1990s.
But, in 2017, the former president's record of sexual impropriety came back into the spotlight in the wake of a number of sexual harassment scandals bringing down a number of politicians, Hollywood celebrities, and journalists. With the Clintons far from power, left-wing pundits have started to re-examine the left's dismissal of the importance of past allegations against Clinton. Both New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) have said that Clinton should have resigned.
A year from the time they were supposed to be America's first husband, Clinton is now increasingly looking like a pariah, even within their own party.
Huma Abedin (and Anthony Weiner)
Huma Abedin and husband Anthony Weiner were once near the center of Hillary Clinton's orbit. Bill Clinton married the pair, and Weiner — a former New York member of congress — once looked set for presidential ambitions. But a series of sexting scandals relegated Weiner to the sidelines. Abedin, however, remained a close Hillary confidante in 2016.
Weiner's sexting with a 15-year-old girl helped doom Hillary's presidential hopes when FBI Director James Comey announced they were reopening the probe into their email use after agents investigating the sexting case found emails on one of Weiner's computers. Clinton has blamed the “Comey letter” for their loss to President Trump.
A year later, Weiner is now in jail, serving a 21-month prison sentence for their crimes. Abedin has filed for divorce from Weiner and has, so far, kept a low profile. However, according to the Washington Free Beacon, as of late October, Abedin was one of a number of former campaign staff still being paid.
John Podesta
Hillary Clinton's campaign chair was the public face of their defeat last November when they came out on Election Night and told followers that Clinton would not make a public appearance in front of their stunned supporters.
A year later, things have not gotten much better for the Democratic mastermind. Podesta, whose emails were dripped out as part of a WikiLeaks leak in the days leading up to the election, pushed the Russia collusion narrative in the days after the failed campaign.
But now the Podesta Group, which John founded with their brother Tony but later divested from, is being subpoenaed as one of six lobbying firms who worked on a campaign between 2012 to 2014 to get Ukraine into the European Union. The New York Times reported last month that employees were told they may soon stop receiving paychecks, as the group has “withered” under scrutiny. Tony Podesta also stepped down from the group as scrutiny intensified.
Robby Mook
Former campaign manager Robby Mook, the man who had been hailed as the mastermind of the Clinton campaign's strategy (before the campaign lost), has spent much of the last year on the defensive. Campaign tell-all book Shattered painted a picture of an arrogant, power-hungry Mook, who was obsessed with data at the expense of everything else.
Since then, they have been fighting with former Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair Donna Brazile, who pointed the finger at the Clinton campaign in their latest book. Mook has denied that the campaign's base in Brooklyn held sway over the DNC and was “anemic” and a boys club. It seems like the post-mortem for Mook's running of the doomed campaign is far from over.
Mook has also been pushing the Russia hacking narrative, working with Republicans on a bipartisan Defending Digital Democracy (DDD) project, to protect America's elections from cyberattack.  They are also a commentator at CNN, where lucky CNN viewers get to see them dismiss Brazile's accusations as “laughable.”
Donna Brazile
In the fall of last year, Donna Brazile was an interim in charge of the DNC, likely to hold significant influence as head of the dominant party in America if the Democrats had taken the Senate and the White House.
A year later, and the Democrats are reeling after they decided to detonate a political bomb within the party with the release of their book Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House. In it, they claimed the DNC nomination process was rigged in Clinton's favor and makes a number of devastating claims about how poorly the Clinton campaign was run.
A year after they were attempting to bring the party together, Brazile is now fueling a raging civil war in the Democratic Party that looks unlikely to be resolved by 2020.
Elizabeth Warren
The hard left's favorite 2020 candidate was somewhat in Hillary Clinton's shadow a year ago. Today, little has changed as Hillary seems intent on holding onto the spotlight as long as they can. However, Pocahontas is continuing their strategy of being a vocal Trump opponent with often outlandish statements while gearing up for their 2018 re-election campaign before they make a decision on 2020.

The University of Hawaii has received a permit from federal Drug Enforcement Administration to import industrial hemp seeds from Australia.
The seeds will be used for Hawaii's Industrial Hemp Research Project, which was created via a state law in 2014.
“This project is just the first step in establishing Hawaii as a leader in the growth and production of industrial hemp and its products,” Rep. Cynthia Thielen (Kailua-Kaneohe Bay) said in a press release Wednesday.
Thielen, a Republican who has long supported industrial hemp in Hawaii, said there was a delay in the permitting process because hemp seeds are considered Schedule I drug by the feds and so require DEA approval before being imported, bought or sold.

Marijuana is a Schedule I drug, and hemp comes from the same Cannabis sativa plant, but won't you get you high.
According to Thielen's office, UH Professor Harry Ako will be the lead researcher on the hemp project investigating the use of industrial hemp as a phytorediator, and as a biofuel. Phytoremediation involves the “direct use of green plants to stabilize or reduce contamination in soils which is needed to rejuvenate contaminated agricultural lands.”
Ako said in a statement, “I am looking forward to planting and cultivating this important crop which has so much potential for Hawaii's agricultural future. It is exciting knowing that the University of Hawaii, and our state, is at the forefront in bringing industrial hemp back to our farmers as a crop which offers so much for so many.”
Hemp has a variety of uses, according to the Hemp Basics website, including in food products and as fiber for clothing and construction materials.
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's powerful army chief General Raheel Sharif has warned India of "unbearable damage" if it tried to impose a short or long war on their country."Let me reiterate that our armed forces stand fully capable to defeat all sorts of external aggression."If the enemy ever resorts to any misadventure, regardless of its size and scale — short or long — it will have to pay an unbearable cost," they said in their address at a special event organised by army at its headquarters in Rawalpindi on Sunday to mark the 50 anniversary of the 1965 war with India.The remarks were a pointed response to a statement by Indian Army chief General Dalbir Singh Suhag who said last week that Indian Army was prepared for "swift, short nature of future wars"."Armed forces of Pakistan are fully capable of dealing with all types of internal and external threats, may it be conventional or sub-conventional; whether it is cold start or hot start. We are ready," said General Raheel.This time the reference was towards India's cold start doctrine of war.Terming Kashmir as "unfinished agenda of partition", they said that it should be resolved according to UN resolution which calls for plebiscite to decide its future.He also warned that Kashmir cannot be out in the back-burner.He promised to dismantle the entire networks of militants in the country."I reiterate the resolve that we shall not relent until all terrorists, their financiers, abettors, facilitators and sympathisers are brought to justice," they said.He also assured Afghanistan of support in creating peace and said that Pakistan made "concerted and sincere efforts for bringing peace in Afghanistan but certain inimical forces are bent upon undermining our efforts."
To be honest, the Data Transfer Object pattern is not my favourite one. I like to keep my code DRY and the idea of replicating parts of the domain model does not appeal to me. However, exposing entities directly to clients can be tricky, mostly due to their relational nature. Lazily loaded relationships and lengthy object graphs can soon become an issue. Also, more often than not, different clients have different views on the same data and making your core business logic client-agnostic is probably the last thing you want to do. DTO to the rescue, as it provides a good control over the data volume and shape.
For the sake of performance and maintainability, the mapping between DTOs and entities should be as straightforward as possible. To achieve this, DTOs should be mere data containers and stick closely to the underlying entites. Ideally, the mapping can be automated and becomes transparent.
What follows is a sample application of the DTO pattern. The key feature is the seamless conversion between domain model and DTOs. The Orika mapper proved brilliant for this job.
The application is a simple address book, Person and Address being the only entities:
@Entity public class Person { @Id private Long id; @Column(name = "first_name", nullable=false) private String firstName; @Column(name = "last_name", nullable=false) private String lastName; @Column(nullable=false, unique=true) private String email; @OneToMany(mappedBy = "person") private Collection<Address> addresses; ... } @Entity public class Address { @Id private Long id; // The usual address fields (street, city, etc.) @ManyToOne private Person person; ... }
Missouri state Rep. Mike Leara (R) loves the Second Amendment so much they want to make it a felony for state lawmakers to propose legislation they think would violate it.On Sunday, Leara offered up this addition to Missouri law:
“Any member of the general assembly who proposes a piece of legislation that further restricts the right of an individual to bear arms, as set forth under the second amendment of the Constitution of the United States, shall be guilty of a class D felony,” Leara's bill reads in its entirety.
Leara's bill comes amidst a flurry of red state legislation aimed at nullifying any new firearms regulations coming out of Washington in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., school massacre. (The White House and other supporters of new gun control have said over and over their proposals do not violate the Constitutional right to bear arms.)
Unlike some of the sponsors of those bills, Leara said they don't expect their bill to pass. They filed the bill criminalizing certain bill language to make a point about freedom, they said.
“I filed HB 633 as a matter of principle and as a statement in defense of the Second Amendment rights of all Missourians,” they said in a statement sent to TPM Tuesday. “I have no illusions about the bill making it through the legislative process, but I want it to be clear that the Missouri House will stand in defense of the people's Constitutional right to keep and bear arms.”

We must begin by separating fact from fiction. The walking dead are neither a work of "black magic" nor any other supernatural force. Their origin stems from a virus known as Solanum, a Latin word used by Jan Vanderhaven, who first "discovered" the disease.
SOLANUM: THE VIRUS
Solannm works by traveling through the bloodstream, from the initial point of entry to the brain. Through means not yet fully understood, the virus uses the cells of the frontal lobe for replication, destroying them in the process. During this period, all bodily functions cease. By stopping the heart, the infected subject is rendered''dead." The brain, however, remains alive hut dormant, while the virus mutates its cells into a completely new organ. The most critical trait of this new organ is its independence from oxygen. By removing the need for this all- important resource, the undead brain can utilize, but is in no way dependent upon, the complex support mechanism of the human body.
Once mutation is complete, this new organ reanimates the body into a form that bears little resemblance (physiologically speaking) to the original corpse. Some bodily functions remain constant, others operate in a modified capacity, and the remainder shut down completely.

Some bodily functions remain constant, others operate in a modified capacity, and the remainder shut down completely. This new organism is a zombie, a member of the living dead.
SYMPTOMS
The timetable below outlines the process of an infected human (give or take several hours, depending on the individual).
Hour 01: Pain and discoloration (brown-purple) of the infected area Immediate clotting of the wound provided the infection came hm a wound).
Hour 05: Fever (99-103 degrees F), chills, slight dementia, vomiting, acute pain in the joints.
Hour 08: Numbing of extremities and infected area, increased fever (103-106 degrees F), increased dementia, loss of muscular coordination.
Hour 11: Paralysis in the lower body, overall numbness, slowed heart rate.
Hour 16: Coma.
Hour 20: Heart stoppage. Zero brain activity
Hour 23: Reanimation.
TRANSFERENCE
Solanum is 100 percent communicable and 100 percent fatal. Fortunately for the human race, the virus is neither waterborne nor airborne. Humans have never been known to contract the virus from elements in nature. Infection can occur only through direct fluid contact. A zombie bite, although by far the most recognizable means of transference, is by no means the only one. Humans have been infected by brushing their open wounds against those of a zombie or by being splattered by its remains after an explosion.Ingestion of infected flesh (provided the person has no open mouth sores), however, results in permanent death rather than infection. Infected flesh has proven to be highly toxic.
No information - historical, experimental, or otherwise - has surfaced regarding the results of sexual relations with an undead specimen, but as previously noted, the nature of Solanum suggests a high danger of infection. Warning against such an act would be useless, as the only people deranged enough to try would they unconcerned for their own safety. Many have argued that, given the congealed nature of undead bodily fluids, the chances of infection from a non-bite contact should be low. However, it must be remembered that even one organism is enough to begin the cycle.
CROSS-SPECIES INFECTION
Solannm is fatal to all living creatures, regardless of size, species, or ecosystem. Reanimation, however, takes place only in humans. Studies have shown that Solanum infecting a non-human brain will die within hours of the death of its host, making the carcass safe to handle. Infected animals expire before the virus can replicate throughout their bodies. Infection from insect bites such as from mosquitoes can also they discounted. Experiments have proven that all parasitic insects can sense and will reject an infected host 100 percent of the time.
TREATMENT
Once a human is infected, little can be done to save them or them Because Solanum is a virus and not a bacterium, antibiotics have no effect. Immunization, the only way to combat a virus, is equally useless, as even the most minute dosage will lead to a full-blown infection. Genetic research is under way. Goals range from stronger human antibodies to resistant cell structure to a counter-virus designed to identify and destroy Solanum. This and other, more radical treatments are still in the earliest stages, with no foreseeable success in the near future. Battlefield experiences have led to the immediate severing of the infected limb (provided this is the location of the bite), but such treatments are dubious at best, with less than a 10 percent success rate. Chances are, the infected human was doomed from the moment the virus entered their or their system.
Should the infected human choose suicide, they should remember that the brain must be eliminated first. Cases have been recorded in which recently infected subjects, deceased by means other than the virus, will nonetheless reanimate. Such cases usually occur when the subject expires after the fifth hour of infection. Regardless, any person killed after being bitten or otherwise infected by the undead should be immediately disposed of.
REANIMATING THE DEAD
(Reuters) - Authorities on Monday investigated a shooting in which two people were killed and four others wounded after a Mardi Gras parade in a Mississippi Gulf town, police said.
Officers directing traffic heard shots fired shortly after the parade ended on Sunday, Pass Christian Police Chief Timothy Hendricks said at a news conference on Monday.
Two men died at the scene, they said, and four others were wounded and treated at a hospital. Two of the wounded were in stable condition on Monday afternoon and two others were released, Hendricks said.
There were no immediate arrests. Hendricks said they did not consider the incident an act of terrorism, or being racially motivated.
“It's a horrible act,” they said during a news conference webcast by WLOX TV News.
They said the shootings were unrelated to the parade that drew an estimated 50,000 people to the small Gulf town about 30 miles west of Biloxi.
Hendricks said multiple shots were fired, and casings that were found indicated two firearms were used. Authorities were still trying to determine whether there had been one or more assailants, they said.
A vehicle containing evidence was impounded, they added.
Authorities performed autopsies on the two dead men, they said. Their ages were 29 and 43 years old, WLOX reported on its website, citing the Harrison County Coroner.
ROXBURY — Morris County Prosecutor Fredric M. Knapp and Officer in Charge Martin McParland, Jr., of the Rockaway Township Police Department, announce that Roger Schneider, 55, residing at 11 Notch Road, Rockaway Township, has been charged with Endangering the Welfare of a Child, in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4a(1), a crime of the 2nd degree, and Aggravated Criminal Sexual Contact, in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:14-3a, a crime of the 3rd degree. Schneider is the Assistant Principal at Roxbury High School.
During the week of April 20, 2015, the alleged victim (referred to by the fictitious initials X.X.) disclosed to a third person that Schneider had sexually touched X.X. Schneider was subsequently interviewed on or about April 24, 2015, and admitted committing acts of contact upon X.X.'s intimate parts. During a subsequent interview by law enforcement, X.X. disclosed acts of sexual contact between Schneider's hand and X.X.'s genitals. X.X. resided part time at the defendant's home between the dates of August of 2013 and January of 2015. The defendant was acting in loco parentis to the victim with X.X.'s parents' consent. X.X. was 15 years old at the time of the alleged incidents. X.X. is not a student in the Roxbury school district.
On April 24, 2015, the Honorable Gerard Smith, J.M.C., authorized charges against Schneider for Endangering the Welfare of a Child, in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4a(1), a crime of the 2rd degree, and Aggravated Criminal Sexual Contact, in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:14-3a, a crime of the 3rd degree. Schneider was arrested by the Rockaway Police Department on April 25, 2015, and bail was set at $100,000 with no 10% option, no contact with the victim, and surrender of any firearms.
The investigation is active and ongoing. No other information is being released at this time.
Anyone with information relating to these charges or any similar conduct by this defendant is urged to contact Detective Bruce LaFera of the Morris County Prosecutor's Office Sex Crimes/Child Endangerment Unit at 973 285-6200.
Prosecutor Knapp would like to thank the Rockaway Township Police Department and the Morris County Prosecutor's Office Sex Crimes/Child Endangerment Unit.
A criminal complaint is merely an accusation. Despite this accusation, the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

Image caption Vicky Hall's back after applying Piz Buin suncream
The healthcare company Johnson & Johnson says it will change the formula for its Piz Buin 1 Day Long suncream after more than 150 people told BBC Watchdog about allergic reactions.
They complained of bright red bumps on the skin, fluid-filled lumps, blisters, itchy eyes and, in one case, a severely swollen face.
The substance thought to be causing the reaction is used in dozens of products.
Doctors are calling for "immediate action" from the industry.
Johnson & Johnson has said it will change the formulation of the suncream from summer next year.
Sophie Holmes, a marketing executive from London, told the Watchdog programme what happened after they applied the Piz Buin cream during a sunny skiing holiday in the Alps this year.
"I came home on the Sunday evening and drove back from France. As we were driving it got worse and worse and worse and started to swell in my face and in my neck, and so I went straight to A&E in London.
"They prescribed me with steroids to reduce the swelling as it was a worry - it was restricting my airways and could become fatal."
Leading dermatologist Dr Ian White from St Thomas' Hospital, London, has identified a preservative known as MI (Methylisothiazolinone) as the likely cause of reactions like Sophie's.
When Watchdog first highlighted this potentially harmful ingredient in June this year, Johnson & Johnson did not amend the formula because it claimed the number of reported instances of reaction was small.
However, since that first report, Watchdog has heard from more than 150 consumers who have suffered adverse reactions to Piz Buin.
Widely used
It is not just Johnson & Johnson that uses the preservative in its products. MI is in many other cosmetic products, and allergies to MI are increasing.
Charity shop manager Vicky Hall, from Liverpool, suffered extreme reactions to Piz Buin and two other cosmetics - and subsequent allergy tests confirmed that MI was the culprit across the three products.
For dermatologists in the UK, the expected rate of allergic reaction from any cosmetic product can be seen in 1-2% of the patients they see.
Data from leading UK dermatology clinics reports that the rate of reaction to MI is over 10%. That is more than twice the level of another ingredient called MDBGN (methydibromo glutaronitrile) which was banned by the European Commission in 2008.
Dr White says: "The frequency of reactions to MI is unprecedented in my experience. We've never seen anything quite like it.
"It is a new phenomenon, and at this present time, there is no suggestion that we have reached the top of that frequency or that it is starting to drop.
"Contact allergy to this permitted preservative is now of epidemic proportions."
In a statement, Johnson & Johnson said: "Piz Buin 1 Day Long provides safe and effective sun protection. It contains only permitted ingredients at levels well within EU standards set by regulators.
"Many substances in our daily life, including ingredients in cosmetic products, may cause irritation in some people with a particular sensitivity. This applies to Methylisothiazolinone, a preservative used to protect products from spoiling, which is found in many consumer and household products.
"We are continuously seeking to improve the effectiveness and consumer experience of our products. As part of this ongoing process we are currently updating Piz Buin 1 Day Long and, from summer 2014, a new formulation that does not contain MI will be available in the UK."

That's right, this soup is not just vegan and gluten free, but it's also packed with fiber, protein and is dairy free! The best part, this is a great way to get a ton of vegetable servings in one meal.
There are a few comfort foods I have yet to “healthify” and broccoil cheese soup was one of them. The classic is so rich and creamy, I didn't think I would be able to recreate that without using heavy cream or at least a few cups of cheese.
But after making the Best Ever Mushroom White Bean Soup with pureed white beans, I've been a bit obsessed with pureeing white beans to thicken soups and sauces, and I'm constantly amazed how filling the dish is with the addition of the white beans.

Well clearly I had to try this with broccoli and cheese soup, after all it's getting chilly here and there is nothing quite like a big bowl of soup to warm up from the inside out. This soup will certainly be on my weekly rotation, it's so easy to make and it's pretty cheap! You could use frozen cauliflower and broccoli to really boost the savings. The big savings come wtih not having to add 3-4 cups of cheese to the soup. Cheese always seems to make the price skyrocket.
Did I mention this soup is packed with veggies. The other secret ingredient to this thick, creamy soup. CAULIFLOWER. Yup, there is a whole head of cauliflower in there as well. I told you it was packed with veggies. And these are hidden in the cheese soup, so even if your kids refuse to eat the broccoli, you can have them eat the cauliflower “cheese” and they won't be any wiser to your little trick.
I've actually been playing around with a cauliflower lately as well. I'm pretty convinced there is nothing that cauliflower can't do. I can't wait to share some creative ways to use this versatile veggie soon!
So this soup is crazy simple. Only one pot is required, and the ingredient list (without salt and pepper) is only 9 ingredients. How simple is that? I'm telling you anyone can make this soup, you just need an immersion blender or blender and the best vegan cheese replacement; nutritional yeast.
Broccoli Cheese Soup Spotlight
Nutritional yeast, if you haven't heard of it before, is a staple in most vegan pantry's. Not only does it taste very similar to cheese, but it's packed with protein and other necessary vitamins and minerals. Nutritional yeast is a great way for vegans and vegetarians to get Vitamin B-12. Vitamin B-12 deficiencies can lead to low white blood cells.
Vitamin B-12 is normally found in animal foods. Most vegans and vegetarians are required to supplement with Vitamin B-12 but nutritional yeast and fortified foods like grains and non-dairy milk are great ways to get Vitamin B-12 without supplements.
Nutritional yeast can be found online but I really like to buy mine in the bulk foods bins at Whole Foods or Earth Fare. You can buy just what you need. However, once you try this you will want to start adding it to things like spaghetti and mac and cheese to give it a nutritional boost and that cheesy taste we all love!
So now that you know how healthy this soup is, lets make a pot, put on our comfy slippers and get cozy on the couch with a good movie ok?

The first step to recovery, so the saying goes, is admitting you have a problem.
New York City transit has a dire cost problem. After decades of stasis and road-building after World War II, the nation's largest city came roaring back to life in the 1990s. It quickly realized that with urban decline coming to an end, so must end its transit-building dry spell. As a result, four Manhattan megaprojects were funded: The first phase of the Second Avenue subway on the Upper East Side, a new Long Island Rail Road terminal called “East Side Access,” the 7 train extension to Hudson Yards, and a renovation of Fulton Street subway stations in the Financial District.
These projects are in various stages of completion, but all have one thing in common: A crippling inability to control costs. Each was far more expensive than any comparable project abroad — more than twice as expensive at the very least, and in many cases far more — and each would have set world records if the others hadn't already. (Fulton Center, at $1.4 billion, avoided becoming the most expensive subway station on earth only because the World Trade Center PATH station next door took that crown. The 7 train extension won't become the world's most expensive subway on a per-mile basis only because that honor belongs to the Second Avenue subway.)
Subway tunnels in other dense, first-world cities can vary widely in cost, but almost always clock in at between $200 million and $1 billion per mile of route. The Second Avenue subway is costing New Yorkers around $2.3 billion per mile, not adjusting for inflation, and the 7 train extension has a similar price tag. Fulton Center and East Side Access are a bit tougher to compare, but suffice it to say that their costs (and, in the case of East Side Access, its very design) have no precedent anywhere on this planet.
To the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, however, barely any problem seems to exist at all. Michael Horodniceanu, who leads the construction of these four megaprojects as president of the MTA's Capital Construction Company, said as much during a Wednesday talk on the 7 train extension and Fulton Center, hosted by the Transit Museum.
At around the midpoint of the Q&A segment, Michael Grynbaum, once the New York Times' transportation reporter, raised the billion-dollar question: “Put bluntly, why do these projects cost so much?”
Horodniceanu gave a number of answers throughout the evening. They blamed, for example, the byzantine work rules that construction unions have negotiated for themselves — something nobody with a passing familiarity of the work rules that MTA management toils under on the operations side would doubt. One reporter with TunnelTalk visited the East Side Access tunnels and came away with the impression that the sandhogs “worked for the Union rather than the contractor.”
Horodniceanu also blamed New Yorkers' intolerant attitudes toward disruption at the surface, which has certainly been a problem in the past, even in unpopulated Central Park.
But many of their answers were not so credible, and left me with the distinct impression that not only does the MTA misunderstand why its projects are so expensive, but that the agency doesn't even necessarily see the high costs as a problem that needs fixing in the first place.
“Do you think that it's a problem?” I asked Horodniceanu of the high costs, after their talk was over.
“Is it a problem?” they replied. “Is it a problem that an apartment in New York costs a lot of money?” It was the same answer they gave Grynbaum when on stage.
Consider this: Hong Kong has by some measures the most expensive housing market in the world, but even that city can build a mile of subway for less than half of what New York pays. Aboveground construction costs in New York are, in fact, fairly similar to those in its peer first-world megacities. Why should below-ground costs be any different?
Horodniceanu seemed skeptical of the figures I threw at them about subway construction in other cities, apparently in disbelief that Paris, for example, can build subways for 80 percent less than New York's per-route-mile costs. “I wouldn't be — I would not say that in France underground work is cheap,” they said.
On to Hordoniceanu's next point: “We are in a densely populated area that has 100,000 [people] per square mile.”
True, the Upper East Side is very dense. But they negated this argument almost immediately by noting that the 7 extension was not in a particularly dense part of the city. (In fact, the area around the future station at 34th Street and 11th Avenue is virtually devoid of any development at all.) Horodniceanu pointed out that this project wasn't as pricey on a per-mile basis as the Second Avenue line on the Upper East Side, but the two were not far off in cost, and the 7 train is still several times more expensive than comparable lines abroad. Urban density is clearly not what drives the majority of the cost gap.
Will the second phase of the Second Avenue line — which extends north up 125th Street to East Harlem, and includes substantial segments that were completed in the 1970s — be any cheaper than the first phase?
“No,” Horodniceanu said. “It's going to be similar because of the length of it.”
A conceptual plan released by the MTA in 2002 showed that the entire second phase would be built using a cheaper (but more disruptive) cut-and-cover method. Hordoniceanu, though, said that the current plan is to bore about 1,500 feet of tunnel using the same sort of machines that dug the first phase.
Higher up at the MTA, there seems to be the same shoulder-shrugging attitude toward costs. Last April I put the same question to Tom Prendergast, whom New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had just chosen to head the MTA: Are the city's high subway construction costs a problem?
“When I started in the industry back in 1974,” they said at the time, “the rules of thumb were $100 a mile aboveground, $100 million below ground.” (That latter figure comes out to $500 million adjusted for inflation — about a third what New York actually pays now.) “Obviously we're at a very different place,” they said. “The cost of construction is what the cost of construction is.”
Not everyone is so nonchalant in the face of the MTA's jaw-dropping costs. “We cannot build a 21st-century city and compete globally if we continue to spend five, even seven times as much on construction projects as compared to our competitors,” said Scott Stringer, then Manhattan borough president and now city comptroller, at a transportation conference in 2011. “There's almost this sense that we can't get it done any other way,” they said of New York's perennially delayed and over-budget transit projects. “We cannot allow that to be the case, or we're never going to be able to build out the city.”
While politicians like Stringer can raise a stink about MTA practices, they ultimately have very little control over the state-run agency. Until the MTA — or, more realistically, the governor who calls the shots — at least acknowledges its crushing cost problem, New York is likely doomed to price tags that make anything beyond the most basic of projects little more than a pipe dream.
“There was a lot of bad blood apparently in Bailieboro,” was one of the standout sentences from the testimony this week at the Charleton tribunal.
It came in evidence from the veteran crime journalist Paul Williams, when they were asked if he'd heard any rumours circulating during 2014 about whistleblower Sgt Maurice McCabe.
The tribunal is investigating whether senior Garda management, up to commissioner level, were involved in smearing McCabe. who had been investigated for child sex abuse in 2006/2007.
In January 2006 Sgt McCabe was attending the scene of a young man's suicide when another sergeant from Bailieboro, who is being called Mr D, turned up with two colleagues “highly emotional and intoxicated”.
The men had come directly from a pub, where they had heard of the death of the young man, who was known to them. Sgt McCabe later reported the incident, and D was reassigned to new duties.
D and McCabe knew each other, their families mixed, and their children played together. It was when they were all in the McCabe house in 1998 that D's then six-year-old daughter (Ms D) said an event occurred which in December 2006 they claimed constituted sexual assault.
‘Horseplay'
When they saw the Garda file on the matter, the Cavan State solicitor Rory Hayden described the disputed incident as constituting “horseplay and no more”. No charges were brought.
Supt Noel Cunningham, then an inspector, investigated the 2006 allegation, even though they protested against being assigned the duty given that they knew both sergeants. Cunningham's report to the DPP recommended no prosecution and included mention of the suicide incident.
When the letter came from the DPP containing the decision that no charges should be brought, it went first to Hayden, and then to Cunningham. Cunningham said they were away from their office at the time and it was almost three weeks before they opened it. They said that when they went to contact McCabe they found it difficult to arrange a meeting. McCabe was not accommodating, they said. Eventually a meeting occurred.
What Cunningham did not know was that Hayden had already told McCabe about the DPP's response, including an observation that even if there were no doubts as to Ms D's credibility, the incident they had described “does not constitute a sexual assault, or indeed an assault”.
McCabe had been wondering why Cunningham had not told him. They turned up to the meeting with Cunningham accompanied by a representative from the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.
No prosecution
Cunningham told McCabe that the DPP had decided there should be no prosecution, but not the other details, since that was the rule then. Gardaí did not give the details of the DPP's decisions, they said.
“Can you imagine,” asked McCabe's counsel, Michael McDowell SC, “that somebody who believed they had been cleared emphatically and that the DPP had ruled that there had been no offence of any kind, even if what was described had occurred, that that person might not think that a direction that there was insufficient evidence for a prosecution, dealt fairly with the situation?”
Cunningham said they were following the rules.
Later, they were subjected to a number of complaints, complaints into which McCabe had an input. When asked, they said it was fair to say that McCabe “had been a thorn in your side” and had made them “feel uncomfortable over the years with the allegations that they had levelled” against him.
McCabe's complaints, and Garda HQ's response, led in time to the Guerin report, the O'Higgins commission, the tribunal, and the resignations of commissioner Martin Callinan and the minister for justice, Alan Shatter.
Conversation taped
At one stage, in the context of the O'Higgins commission and complaints by McCabe against Mr D, Cunningham met McCabe in Mullingar and, unbeknownst to Cunningham, the conversation was taped.
Cunningham said they were shocked to discover later that McCabe had taped him. Judge Charleton, who acted as counsel for the Morris Tribunal into Garda conduct in Donegal, observed that “there seems to be a lot of gardaí recording each other's conversations surreptitiously. It certainly surfaced in Donegal as well.”
They later accepted that they should not ascribe such practices generally to the Garda. Cunningham said they never taped anyone in their life.
In October 2007 there were two public incidents involving McCabe and members of the D family, including one where, according to the chairperson, McCabe “retreated to the station and ran up the stairs”.
McCabe complained, but did not want to see prosecutions. What they did want was that the substance of the DPP's conclusion be given to them and the D family, in the hope that this would ease the difficulties they were experiencing in the Bailieboro station. This did not happen. McCabe later moved to Mullingar.
Adds context
All of this adds context to the tribunal's job of deciding whether senior Garda management were smearing McCabe a decade after the sex abuse allegation had been dismissed.
Some people apparently believed that McCabe's whistleblowing activities were motivated by the 2006 allegation and the non-release of the DPP's reasons for deciding against charges.
As Williams put it: “It was a vague rumour that there was a grievance, that this was not just out of the blue, that there was a history to it.”
There was bad blood in Bailieboro.
The question is whether this talk of bad blood tipped over to people being told there had been a child sex abuse allegation, and whether this was part of an exercise directed from Garda HQ to discredit a man who had complained about the quality of Garda operations, by saying they were motivated by “malice and revenge”.

Naughty Dogâ€™s latest blockbuster, The Last of Us, is already receiving global acclaim.Â SpawnFirst gave out Editorâ€™s choice award to the title, as well as its first ever perfect score.Â And while the game might be geared toward an emotional single player experience, that doesnâ€™t mean the multiplayer has been forgotten about.Â In fact, the focused, tactical, teamwork-based online has turned into some of the most fun you can have on a console period.
Thereâ€™s one specific reason I love to play online: Like a primal beast, I am highly intrigued by expressing my dominance over other inferior members of my species.Â This is a multiplayer mode that is heavily based on skill and communication, so it is a prime environment for this type of behavior.
Is it really that much different from other multiplayer offerings, though?Â I can already hear you asking that question and, oh my, it is a delightfully idiotic question.Â Quite simply, yes.Â It is nearly incomparable to anything else out there.Â These are four reasons (off the top of my head, mind you) that The Last of Us has the greatest multiplayer ever.Â And it doesnâ€™t even need downloadable hats.
1)Â Thereâ€™s No Babying or Pure Luck
So many games nowadays try too hard to accommodate every skill level.Â Marvel vs Capcom 3 has an â€˜Easy Modeâ€™ that lets even the most inept monkey feel like an arcade stick wizard.Â Call of Duty is notorious for putting in crutches that do nothing but help players who die a lot, and even have perks that are only activated by going on a dying streak.Â Heck, some games are even simple enough for girls to pick up and playâ€¦
â€¦just kidding.Â For real, girls are gamers too.
But in all reality, The Last of Us does a great job of separating the men from the boys â€“ but surprisingly enough â€“ newcomers wonâ€™t be ripped a new arse when playing online, similar to what happens so often in the MOBA and RTS genres.Â If you can learn the basic mechanics and understand the finer points of survival, youâ€™ll find yourself at the top of every match.Â Likewise, reckless morons that sprint around the map and lob grenades like your average Call of Battlefield: Medal Ops 5 players will get decimated.Â Skill and patience is vital, and itâ€™s oh, so satisfying.
2) Teamwork Actually Matters
As much as companies like to advertise headsets as a tactical approach to online, we all know itâ€™s really nothing more than an object that lets you trash talk others and hear ridiculous accusations about mothers.Â While that hasnâ€™t changed completely in The Last of Us, I have learned that my win percentage skyrockets when I can communicate with my teammates.Â In a game where itâ€™s literally impossible to take out multiple enemies by yourself (unless you do so with stealth), having backup firepower, someone to tag hostiles, or a partner to revive you when injured is always beneficial.Â Handling incoming Hunters with precision and accuracy always leaves a smug grin on my face.
It also leaves the door wide open for diversified strategies.Â Having a medic on your team is just as important as an up-close-and-personal bruiser, and keeping a certified stealth expert on your team for flanking the opponent will result in easy kills while you're busy making a distraction.Â Thereâ€™s a load of unlocks, but none are gamebreakers; in fact, I almost exclusively use a single loadout based on staying quiet, and I created it after just my second match.Â While I enjoy the stealthy route, Iâ€™ve played with someone that has a polar opposite playstyle, and they edged me out on the leaderboard a time or two (or ten).
3) Encounters Are Terrifying
Like, really terrifying.Â Texas Chainsaw Massacre terrifying.Â Any time you come across an enemy, one false step will get you killed, losing a team life in the process and denying yourself an Execution of your own.Â When most matches come down to you only getting five or six kills, every enemy you see makes your heart race.
This goes double for the Survivor lobby, which gives you just a single life per round.Â While this isnâ€™t necessarily a new idea, most other games will result in every damn person pitching a tent and camping.Â But, because of vital resource stashes placed around every map, camping will do nothing but leave you vastly unprepared for an enemy attack.Â Moving around will keep you alive and allow you to get the jump on enemies.Â And when it comes down to a three-on-one duel and youâ€™re the teamâ€™s last hope, your underpants will tell you how petrifying â€“ and utterly engaging â€“ this experience can actually be.
4) Something Bigger Going On Hereâ€¦
The entire online offering is referred to as â€˜Factionsâ€™ from the main menu, and it is a much better fit than â€˜Multiplayerâ€™.Â For those of you that havenâ€™t dipped into it yet, the main concept is that you run an ever-expanding clan on your own.Â Instead of XP, kills net you supplies; in turn, these supplies help your clan grow larger and stay healthy.
Itâ€™s not an incredibly deep system â€“ on the surface.Â The amount of supplies per match you need understandably increases as your clan grows, to the point where anything less than your best effort will put you at serious risk of losing clan members.Â To put it simply, if someone plays too cautiously they could lose a GIGANTIC chunk of their members.Â Having something constantly at stake during every game not only strongly encourages you to do well, but it also gives you a reason to tell your friends â€œNo you canâ€™t play.Â I donâ€™t want you to screw up my account.â€
And after they get pissed off at you and leave, youâ€™ll be free to play the greatest multiplayer offering to date.

India's GDP grew 5.7 per cent on a year-on-year basis during the April-June period.
Highlights Slowdown mainly due to temporary disruption caused by GST: World Bank GST will have hugely positive impact on Indian economy: Jim Yong Kim PM Modi has stressed government "capable" of reversing the setback
Arun Jaitley will attend the annual meetings of IMF and the World Bank in Washington.
The recent slowdown in India's economic growth is an "aberration" and mainly due to a temporary disruption caused by preparations for the new national tax GST, the World Bank said on Thursday, also stating that it will get corrected in the coming months.World Bank President Jim Yong Kim also said that the Goods and Services Tax (GST) will have a hugely positive impact on the Indian economy. They were talking to reporters on a conference call ahead of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will lead the Indian delegation at next week's meeting."There's been a deceleration in the first quarter, but we think that's mostly due to temporary disruptions in preparation for the GST, which by the way is going to have a hugely positive impact on the economy," Mr Kim said to questions on the slowdown in India's growth in the first quarter, which Opposition parties and several economists have attributed to last year's demonetisation and GST.India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew 5.7 per cent on a year-on-year basis during the April-June period (Q1). The GDP growth rate for the same quarter last year was 7.9 per cent. During the previous quarter (January-March) of this year, GDP grew by 6.1 per cent.The World Bank president said, "We think that the recent slowdown is an aberration which will correct in the coming months, and the GDP growth will stabilise during the year. We've been watching carefully, as Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi has really worked on improving the business environment, and so, we think all of those efforts will pay off as well."The Centre too has emphasised that the slowdown is temporary, with PM Modi stressing that the government is "committed to and capable" of reversing the setback. In an address to company secretaries in Delhi on Wednesday, PM Modi made a strong defence of their government's economic policies, dismissing critics as " people who sleep well only after they spread a feeling of pessimism ."Union minister Piyush Goyal told NDTV yesterday that " the economy is in very good shape " and that the slowdown in growth is temporary, caused by the big and complex transition to a new national tax regime GST.At next week's meeting, both the World Bank and the IMF are expected to come out with new GDP figures and growth projections for India and the rest of the world.Mr Kim said after years of disappointing growth, the global economy has begun to accelerate, and trade is picking up as well, but investment remains weak.On India and human capital, Mr Kim said Prime Minister Modi has made a huge commitment to sanitation issues, and called 'Swachh Bharat' one of the "most effective programmes" anywhere."I know that Prime Minister Modi themselves personally is very committed to improving opportunities for all of India. But, India has a lot of challenges. We look at some of the educational outcomes, we've looked at some of the health outcomes, and India has room to improve, like most other countries," they said."Our job is to take the political will and commitment that Prime Minister Modi has clearly demonstrated and has communicated to everyone, and then bring to India the most effective intervention that will, as quickly as possible, improve the stock of human capital," Mr Kim said.That, they said, was the message for every country in the world.This year, the Bank is producing a new report in a series on 'The Changing Wealth of Nations'. For the first time, it has added human capital to its wealth analysis, in addition to produced capital, things like machinery and buildings, natural capital, energy, forests, agricultural lands, and net foreign assets, Mr Kim said.
They're not your friends
This is already been pretty well picked up elsewhere while I was busy converting the blog: see How New York's Finest Get the Weed Out at Reason and Scott Morgan's Police Will Do Anything to Arrest People for Marijuana, but I wanted to make sure I mentioned it.
I'm talking about Harry G. Levine's article: The Epidemic of Pot Arrests in New York City in Alternet.
You see, in New York, having a small amount of marijuana in your pocket is not an arrest-able offense. However, having it out in the open is.
According to U.S. Supreme Court decisions, police are allowed to thoroughly pat down the outside of someone's clothing looking for a gun, which is bulky and easy to detect. But police cannot legally search inside a person's pockets and belongings without permission or probable cause. However, police officers can legally make false statements to people they stop, and officers can trick people into revealing things. So in a stern, authoritative voice, NYPD officers will say to the young people they stop: “We're going to have to search you. If you have anything illegal you should show it to us now. If we find something when we search you, you'll have to spend the night in jail. But if you show us what you have now, maybe we can just give you a ticket. And if it's nothing but a little weed, maybe we can let you go. So if you've got anything you're not supposed to have, take it out and show it now.” When police say this, the young people usually take out their small amount of marijuana and hand it over. Their marijuana is now “open to public view.” And that – having a bit of pot out and open to be seen – technically makes it a crime, a fingerprintable offense. And for cooperating with the police, the young people are handcuffed and jailed.
People really need to know about this kind of stuff. Serve and protect is a thing of the past. Deceive and destroy are the mottos of today.
Consider this story. A school teacher who liked to smoke pot on their own time in their own home was robbed. They told the police that it was money that was stolen, not pot (he would have been stupid to say that their pot was stolen). The robber was caught and made up a bunch of stories about the teacher having child porn, hosting drug parties for underage children, etc. So the police released those un-investigated allegations (which turned out to be false) to the media, destroying the teacher's life, and jailed the teacher for pot and obstruction of justice (failing to say that it was pot that was stolen from him). The thief wasn't charged.
Or, read this story To Catch a Stoner in Oregon. Tigard police have been on Craigs List trolling for lonely men.
“Tuesday is my last day at work this week and I wanna party on Tues night!! I'm a hot blonde who has all the right moves.” The ad promised to trade those moves to anyone who could offer some “420,” or marijuana.
And the lonely guys who responded?
Walsh had 3.5 grams of weed in their pocket—normally enough to earn them nothing more than a ticket. But because he'd agreed to trade drugs for sex, the cops charged Walsh with misdemeanor prostitution and delivery of drugs, a felony, and booked them into Washington County Jail.
Fortunately, the DA's office is refusing to prosecute some of the cases, realizing that it's classic entrapment. (Read the whole article, it's quite interesting.)
I would like to see the day where the public could feel comfortable with trusting the police. Right now, that trust just isn't there in most cases (that doesn't mean that there aren't individual officers that I trust and admire — there are — just that the occupation as a whole is tarnished, largely by the drug war).
It's important to remember that the police are allowed to lie to you. Some take quite a bit of pride in that fact. When they say that they're your friend and that it's in your best interest to cooperate fully with their requests, it isn't true. And finally, there is never a good reason to voluntarily consent to a search. Ever.
• Goalkeeper suffered knee injury in Sunderland's defeat by Manchester United • Pickford may require surgery and could spend three months on the sidelines
Sunderland's hopes of avoiding relegation appear to have been dealt a significant blow after the goalkeeper Jordan Pickford sustained a serious looking knee injury during the team's Boxing Day defeat at Manchester United.
Pickford's precise prognosis will be confirmed by a specialist but initial assessments from Sunderland's medical staff indicate the England Under-21 goalkeeper, who has undergone scans, could be sidelined for at least three months.
It remains unclear whether the 22-year-old will require surgery but David Moyes will be alarmed at losing a player who has been in outstanding form for the struggling side this season.
David Moyes may not have taken Sunderland job if they had known cash woes Read more
Pickford is likely to be replaced by their understudy, Vito Mannone, at Burnley on New Year's Eve and at home to Liverpool on Monday but their injury may disappoint Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United. They have all been watching Sunderland's young goalkeeper and may have been prepared to bid for them during the January transfer window.
Although Pickford – who took over from Mannone in August after the Italian fractured an elbow – is contracted to Sunderland until 2020, Moyes was believed to be open to selling them in January, providing they could be loaned back to them for the remainder of the season.
With Sunderland £140m in debt and their £73m wage bill leaving them perilously close to breaching Premier League wage cap rules, Moyes will need to sell before they can buy next month and there is little doubt the squad needs strengthening.
A spate of injuries – the majority affecting knees – have not helped their cause. Duncan Watmore and Paddy McNair are already ruled out until next season while Jan Kirchhoff, Lee Cattermole and Lynden Gooch will not return until mid-March at the very earliest.
In 1964, residents of Boston were terrified by a serial killer believed responsible for eleven murders at the time this article was published. Its author, Erle Gardner, a distinguished criminologist, is best known for creating one of the most widely read fictional characters in the English language, Perry Mason. The Atlantic invited them to the Boston area, then home to the magazine, asking that they shed light on the murders. One of the most arresting details in the resulting article is the description of women so fearful that some left the city and others saw their health suffer from stress.
"What do you do about the door when you enter?" one of the women said. "You look in the closets, under the bed, and in the bathroom. If a man is in there you want to be able to run out, screaming for help. Therefore, you should leave the door open. But if you leave the door open while you are making a search, what is to prevent the Strangler from following you in and standing between you and your means of escape when you first see him?"

A protracted battle over increasing the debt limit last summer increased the country's borrowing costs for months before a deal was struck, a new government report estimates.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Turns out there's a price to pay for incessant fighting in Congress and political grandstanding.
The federal government spent an extra $1.3 billion to borrow last year because of the showdown over the debt ceiling, the Government Accountability Office reported Monday.
Republicans in Congress and the Obama administration were locked in battle for months over how to raise the country's legal borrowing limit.
"Delays in raising the debt limit can create uncertainty in the Treasury market and lead to higher Treasury borrowing costs," the GAO said.
Indeed, even though bond rates were low last year, the GAO found that the Treasury Department paid a premium on many government securities in the eight months leading up to the eventual deal in August.
The premium reflected the relative risk of government securities to private-sector debt.
Rates on private-sector debt are typically higher than those on government bonds. But the difference between the two narrowed in 2011.
In other words, investors demanded the government pay higher rates than it would have on federal debt with due dates of two years or more.
The GAO, the country's official auditor, also noted that the longer term costs of the 2011 debt limit fight will be higher, since the interest costs that Treasury locked in during the first eight months of the year will be paid out over time.
There were intangible costs as well amidst the months of uncertainty that preceded lawmakers' deal to raise the debt ceiling and the subsequent downgrade of the country's credit rating by Standard & Poor's.
"[M]anaging federal debt ... was complex, time-consuming, and technically challenging," the GAO said.
Congress, of course, will eventually have to raise the debt ceiling again. Exactly when is unclear.
The legal borrowing limit is currently $16.394 trillion.
As of last Thursday, the country's accrued debt stood $559 billion below that limit. If the government continues to run monthly deficits between $100 billion and $125 billion, the debt load may approach the ceiling as early as mid-November.
But Treasury can buy some time with so-called extraordinary measures such as suspending contributions to federal pension plans.
Has Congress learned its lesson about the risks of political brinksmanship? Apparently not.
For starters,House Speaker John Boehner in May issued the same ultimatum on the debt ceiling that they issued in 2011. They said any debt ceiling increase must be accompanied by an even larger amount of spending cuts.
Since then, both parties have engaged in a battle over the so-called fiscal cliff -- a series of large, overnight tax increases and spending cuts. Combined they would hurt the economy in the short-run if Congress does nothing to replace them with more gradual deficit-reduction strategies.
Just what lawmakers will do about the cliff -- and when -- is unclear. And that uncertainty is already thought to be hurting the economy through a slowdown in hiring and a reluctance among businesses to invest.
The U.S. Air Force's super-secret next generation bomber, which one day could fly unmanned sorties, has moved a step closer to the production line with the Pentagon asking top defense contractors to submit proposals.
Not much is known about the Long Range Strike-Bomber project, which has been run as a classified program since 2011. But the bat-winged stealth bombers would likely cost around $550 million each, and the Air Force hopes to contract for as many as 100. That would add up to as much as $55 billion -- for a fleet of fighter planes the likes of which the world has never seen. Still, the pricetag would be lower than the B-2 currently used.
“The LRS-B is a top modernization priority for the Air Force. It will be an adaptable and highly capable system based upon mature technology,” Air Force secretary Deborah Lee James told the U.S. Naval Institute.
The Air Force's request for proposals is aimed at finding a prime contractor by spring of next year. Northrop Grumman and a Boeing/Lockheed Martin team are the natural choices to build the new bomber.
The Air Force was tight-lipped about the plane, but it is believed that it will be a very long-range subsonic aircraft with broadband stealth capability designed to evade low-frequency radars as effectively as high frequency. The planes will also be certified to carry nuclear weapons and are being designed as part of a Long Range Strike family of systems—and not as an aircraft designed to penetrate into the most heavily defended airspace all by itself, USNI reported.
The LRS-B was originally intended to be an “optionally manned” bomber, but the Air Force has indicated the aircraft will be at least initially manned. It is believed the planes will be larger, carry a bigger payload and have much longer range than the current generation of bombers.
According to Congressional Research Service analyst Jeremiah Gertler, who studied planned funding trendlines in a recent report and determined the Air Force has already done most of the development work on the bomber already. It is possible it has already even built prototypes, in the classified “black” budget, according to BreakingDefense.com.
“My idea is that something related to LRS-B might be already flying,” David Cenciotti, who operates the popular blog The Aviationist, told FoxNews.com. “It could be a technological demonstrator, a prototype or even a production plane.”
Cenciotti said an amateur photographer in Wichita, Kans., is believed to have photographed the plane .
“Even if it may seem far fetched, I think the one over Kansas could be the next generation LRSB,” Cenciotti said. “The reason why the Pentagon has eventually decided to fly the aircraft in daylight (hence exposing it to observers) is still unknown: maybe to distract from something else, or simply to flex muscles with Russia amid growing tensions over Ukraine.”
Even the bases from where these aircraft could be launched and recovered remain a mystery, according to Cenciotti.
They said Nevada's Groom Lake Air Force facility, also known as Area 51, or Whiteman Air Force Base, home of the B-2 fleet and only about 250 miles east of Wichita, would make the most sense.
While the definition of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has changed over the years, one thing has remained relatively constant: the fact that rates of ASD are anywhere from two to five times higher among boys than they are among girls.
Until recently, brain experts haven't focused much on the possible gender-based reasons for this difference. Now, in a report published in JAMA Psychiatry, scientists point to one possible explanation for the discrepancy.
Brain scientists know that some structures in the brain differ between the sexes. One is the thickness of the cortex, the brain's outer layer that is embedded with nerves involved in memory, thinking, language and other higher cognitive functions. Men tend to have thinner cortex measurements, while women tend to have thicker ones, and this difference is a pretty reliable way to distinguish males from females. Taking advantage of this knowledge, Christine Ecker, a professor of neuroscience and brain imaging at Goethe University in Germany, and their colleagues compared the cortical thickness on brain MRIs among 98 adults with ASD and 98 people without the disorder. The thinner the cortex, regardless of gender, the more likely the person was to have ASD. Even for the women with thinner, more male-like cortical thickness readings, the risk of ASD was three times higher than for women with thicker measurements more in line with unaffected women.
“The assumption was that if the male brain were more vulnerable to ASD, then maybe the brains of females with autism have features that resemble the more male-like brain,” says Ecker. They note that the measurements don't mean that the females with thinner readings had male brains. In fact, the study did not look at any of the adult women's brain functions, so it's not clear whether the thinner cortex had any functional effect.

But the results point to a potentially important role for the cortex in better understanding autism. It's possible, for example, that the thicker cortex in women might be protective against developing autism. Ecker says they and their team are looking at other aspects of the cortex to support this idea. That could guide autism researchers towards more of the factors that cause autism, and maybe even provide clues about how to treat its symptoms.
Ecker stresses that their study is just the start. Them findings don't make clear, for example, whether the cortical thickness is causing autism, or if it is simply a symptom of the disorder. In other words, do women who develop autism develop the disorder because they happened to have a thinner cortex, like men, or is their thinner cortex a symptom of the autism they developed due to some other reason? “We don't know at this point,” says Ecker.
With their next studies, they hope to find out. They plan to investigate what functional changes the different thicknesses have on male and female brains to see if they can be connected to autism. They also want to track the changes in cortex measurements over the lifespan, to see if the male and female differences remain from infancy throughout adolescence or whether they begin to appear later in life.

Dozens of Wisconsin dairy farms have found a milk buyer only days before they were losing their current buyer, Grassland Dairy Products, and would have been forced to shut down. (Photo: Journal Sentinel files)
Just days before they might have had to close, most of the Wisconsin dairy farms caught up in a trade dispute with Canada have found buyers for their milk, enabling them to stay in business.
At risk had been some 58 farms ranging in size from 80 to 3,000 cows, including many in Dodge and Jefferson counties and others near Fond du Lac and Sheboygan.
Grassland Dairy Products of Greenwood said it would stop buying from the farms effective this Monday because it lost millions of dollars when Canada changed its milk-buying practices to favor Canadian farmers at the expense of U.S. milk producers.
The move caught the attention of U.S. state and federal lawmakers, who sought a solution to the Wisconsin farmers' desperate situation and called for an investigation of trade pacts with Canada. President Donald Trump also weighed in, telling an audience in Kenosha last week that "in Canada some very unfair things have happened to our dairy farmers and others."
On Thursday, though, dairy farmers close to the situation said nearly all of the farms that lost their contracts with Grassland now appear likely to have new milk buyers by Monday, even if the agreements are short term.
Dairy farmer Jennifer Sauer, of Waterloo, said they fought back tears as they and their husband, Shane, signed a new milk contract with Rolling Hills Dairy Producers Cooperative of Monroe.
“It was just a ton of stress relief,” Sauer said Thursday.
The Sauers have a third-generation family farm that milks about 120 cows. Like others dropped by Grassland, they had been urgently calling all around to find another milk buyer, to no avail until this week.
“I would not wish this upon my worst enemy. It was a terrible three weeks,” Sauer said.
Some of the new contracts have come from Mullins Cheese of Mosinee, Rolling Hills and the cooperative Dairy Farmers of America.
State officials would not confirm the positive turn of events Thursday, although they said earlier that the situation was changing “hour by hour” and they were hopeful it would be resolved by the end of the week.
“We know that we are making really positive strides,” said Karen Gefvert, director of government relations for the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation.
Some of the farms won't get prices as good as they've gotten from Grassland, and their new contracts may be for only a few months. But it's enough to keep them in business while they pursue other options.
Nineteen of 23 displaced farms represented by Dairy Business Milk Marketing Cooperative have new contracts.
“We are still working to confirm the status of the remaining farmers,” said John Pagel, president of the Green Bay-based cooperative, and a dairy farmer in northeastern Wisconsin. “What we're hearing elsewhere is that the majority of farmers have found buyers, too.
Jennifer Sauer, of Waterloo, says she's very relieved that their farm has found a milk buyer this week after it was dropped by Grassland Dairy Products. (Photo: Michael Sears)
“So, overall the news is positive. But until each and every one of these farmers has a buyer for their milk come Monday — and long-term solutions are in place — the work is not done,” they added.
The displaced milk is estimated at 1 million pounds, or about 116,000 gallons, a day. That's milk that farmers otherwise would have had to dump, because cows have to be milked two or three times a day whether or not there's a buyer for the product.
Individual farmers, such as Carrie Mess of Watertown, stepped up to help their neighbors find milk buyers.
“There's still more work to be done, but we are getting there,” Mess said.
The situation was a near crisis because most milk processing plants already were running at full capacity and weren't accepting more farms.
Rolling Hills said it made the difficult decision to take on a couple of the farms even though it didn't need the additional milk now.
“We felt we needed to at least do something, since some of these farms have been going on three weeks to find a buyer, and they weren't getting anywhere,” said Micah Ends, operations manager for Rolling Hills. “As far as we're concerned, they are now members of our cooperative. As long as we have markets to send their milk to, hopefully they will be members for a long time."
While some farmers remained nervous about saying they had new milk contracts until everything was finalized, the tone in the dairy community was much improved Thursday.
“We are hearing some good things, as they're going to stay in business, keep milking cows and continue as family farms," said Andrea Brossard, a dairy farmer from Dodge County. "That's encouraging."
Brossard is part of Dairy Girl Network, an online information source for dairy farmers that's been very involved in helping farms caught in the Grasslands dilemma.
A lot has happened in the last 24 to 48 hours in landing milk buyers, according to Brossard.
"Now these farms can focus on keeping their business going and working towards goals. That's what we like to see," they said.
Still, a few of the displaced farms probably won't find buyers before Monday. The Farm Center at the state Agriculture Department has a “situation room” where staff members are talking with dairy plant owners, trying to connect them with the remaining farms.
There's also a “Plan B” in the works, according to Gefvert, of Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation. No details have been released, and the plan is only tentative. But it could include finding milk haulers to pick up the product from the displaced farms in hopes of finding a processor for it.
“We will keep working as hard as we can to find a home for their milk,” Gefvert said.
Canada has said it's not to blame for the crisis; it faults American farmers for producing too much milk in a global marketplace flooded with it. But U.S. authorities, including Trump, have said the Canadian dairy system is choking off sales of Wisconsin and New York milk in Canada.
“We need to get at the root of the problem,” said Chris Galen, spokesperson for the National Milk Producers Federation in Washington, D.C. “There are long-term ramifications that aren't as visible as a few dozen farms all of a sudden losing their markets. The longer-term impact will affect a much larger number of America's dairy farmers from coast to coast.”

Of course I would need the most complicated title ever to describe the simplest recipe. In fact, it's probably more difficult to say the title out loud than it is to make it. It's that chronic over-sharing thing I do. I just can't help it.
So after an amazing cold front, it is officially into the triple digits for the next 5 months or so with very little hope at dipping back down into anything resembling a reasonable temperature, which means I need ice cream. Not want, need. Have I ever told you that ice cream is my favorite dessert? I rarely make it because I have the hardest time getting the right texture when I make it at home, but coconut milk is pretty much the best ingredient on earth, and when you combine that with sweet, roasted banana, you are looking at a pretty sure thing.
Between the sweetness and creaminess of those two ingredients, I promise you don't need anything else. You can always add a little pure maple syrup or brown sugar if you prefer something a little sweeter, but believe me when I say that roasting that banana brings out all of it's rich sweetness, and totally does the trick. You can also add chocolate chips, cinnamon, extra fruit, pretty much any add-ins you'd like. This recipe is more like your base–your starting point, and a great and simple treat for the long summer months coming our way!
A year ago, Aljamain Sterling was in a hotel gym in Las Vegas telling anyone who'd listen that they wanted to fight Bryan Caraway.
This Sunday, Sterling will be inside the octagon in Las Vegas fighting Caraway.
At nearly all points in between these two moments on the calendar, Sterling found a way to call out Caraway. Twitter. Instagram. Facebook. News conferences. Whatever.
“If someone calls you out that many times, you either step to the table and fight, or you back down and tell them you don't want none of that,” Sterling said. “That's what I was trying to get out of it. So, I got the fight. So we'll see who the bigger, stronger man is in this division.”
Sterling, a Serra-Longo fighter from Uniondale, and Caraway will meet — finally — at UFC Fight Night at the Mandalay Bay Events Center. Sterling (12-0, 4-0 UFC) is the No. 4-ranked bantamweight in the division. Caraway is No. 8.
Don't mistake Sterling's harsh words for hatred of Caraway, they said.
“I actually don't hate Bryan Caraway,” Sterling said. “The only thing I don't like about them is that they don't fight. He's just taking up space on the roster. It's like, if you're gonna do that, go somewhere else and just retire. Go be a housewife. What's wrong with that? You got one of the hottest girls in the game, that's cool. Just don't pretend to be a fighter. If you're gonna be about it, you know, do something. Man up.”

Caraway (20-8, 5-2) is both a longtime coach and boyfriend of Miesha Tate, who won the UFC women's bantamweight title last March. They last fought on July 25, 2015, beating Eddie Wineland by unanimous decision.
Sterling owes their entry into the UFC to Caraway, if only based on serendipitous reasons. Caraway pulled out of a scheduled fight against Lucas Martins at UFC 170 in February 2014, and on three weeks' notice, Sterling signed with the UFC and became the replacement fighter. Martins ended up pulling out of that fight, and Sterling fought and beat Cody Gibson by unanimous decision in their UFC debut.
While the verbal battle with Caraway has been more one-sided, the physical altercation inside the cage could be more interesting. Both Caraway and Sterling are good grapplers. Sterling said they are excited about the challenged of facing a person of Caraway's considerable ground game.
“I want to see where I'm at and make sure I'm taking the right steps to get myself prepared for that championship belt,” Sterling said. “I'm on a journey to be great.”
Sterling headlines the prelims on Fight Pass, UFC's digital streaming service, while two other well-regarded young bantamweights fight in the main event of the night on Fox Sports 1. Thomas Almeida (21-0, 4-0), ranked No. 7 in the UFC's bantamweight division, fights Cody Garbrandt (8-0, 3-0).
“It's going to be interesting to see who puts on the better show that night,” Sterling said. “I'm looking to go guns blazing and make my fight a statement. I want to prove to people that my fight was the main event, my fight was the headliner for this card. I want people to see the ‘Funkmaster' is for real and he's got some legitimiate skill to threaten the champ.”
An Australian zookeeper on Tuesday urged people to catch and donate deadly funnel-web spiders, to help replenish stocks of antidote running low after a spate of spider bites.
The Australian Reptile Park, the country's sole supplier of funnel-web venom to antidote producers since 1981, relies on the public to hand in spiders that are milked for the venom used to produce an antidote.
The anti-venom program was now at risk after too few spiders were donated last year and a recent heatwave encouraged more spider activity and bites, the park's general manager, Tim Faulkner, said on Tuesday.
"We rely on community support to keep this program alive," Faulkner said in a telephone interview.
"We have tried to catch enough spiders ourselves and we just can't."
Funnel-web spiders live throughout southeastern Australia, but the only known killer is the Sydney funnel-web spider, found in the Sydney region and as far north as Newcastle and south to Illawarra, the park says on its website.
"The large fangs and acidic venom make the bite very painful," it said, noting that a major bite can cause death within an hour if left untreated.
After milking the spiders, the park delivers the venom to a division of the blood plasma and vaccine maker CSL Ltd, which converts it into the life-saving antidote.
Australia has had two funnel-web spider attacks in two weeks, media have said, one of them involving a woman bitten by a spider while they were asleep.
Despite the terrifying reputation of Australian wildlife, nobody has died from the bite of a funnel-web spider since the anti-venom program began in 1981.
Catching venomous spiders is safe, as long precautions are followed, Faulkner said.
"With an appropriate jar and a wooden spoon, you can flick the spider into the jar so easily," they said.
"We've been doing this for 35 years and no one's been hurt." (Reporting by Claudia Farhart; Editing by Byron Kaye and Clarence Fernandez)
Researchers have found more digital fingerprints tying this month's WCry ransomware worm to the same prolific hacking group that attacked Sony Pictures in 2014 and the Bangladesh Central Bank last year.
Last week, a researcher at Google identified identical code found in a WCry sample from February and an early 2015 version of Contopee , a malicious backdoor used by the hacking team Lazarus Group. The group has been operating since at least 2011. Additional fingerprints linked Lazarus Group to hacks that wiped almost a terabyte's worth of data from Sony Pictures and siphoned a reported $81 million from the Bangladesh Central Bank last year . Researchers say Lazarus Group carries out hacks on behalf of North Korea.
On Monday, researchers from security firm Symantec presented additional evidence that further builds the case that WCry, which is also known as WannaCry, is closely linked to Lazarus Group. The evidence includes:
The discovery of three pieces of malware previously linked to Lazarus Group that were left on a network hit in the first-known infection of WCry in February. The malware included Trojan.Volgmer and two variants of Backdoor.Destover, the disk wiping tool used in the Sony Pictures attacks.
Trojan.Alphanc, which was used to spread WCry in attacks that took place in March and April, is a modified version of Backdoor.Duuzer, which has previously been linked to Lazarus.
Bravonc, another trojan used to install WCry onto computers in earlier attacks, used the same IP addresses for command and control as Duuzer and Destover.
Bravonc has similar code obfuscation as WCry and Infostealer.Fakepude, another piece of malware linked to Lazarus Group.
Newly discovered similarities between Contopee and the WCry ransomware itself.
The earlier versions of WannaCry and the one used in the May 12 attacks are largely the same, with some minor changes, chiefly the incorporation of the EternalBlue exploit. The passwords used to encrypt the Zip files embedded in the WannaCry dropper are similar across both versions ("wcry@123", "wcry@2016", and "WNcry@2ol7") indicating that the author of both versions is likely the same group. The small number of Bitcoin wallets used by first version of WannaCry, and its limited spread, indicates that this was not a tool that was shared across cyber crime groups. This provides further evidence that both versions of WannaCry were operated by a single group.
The similarities in tools, techniques, and infrastructure, Symantec researchers said, make it "highly likely that Lazarus was behind the spread of WannaCry." In a blog post , they wrote:
In addition to the previously discovered identical code found in both WCry and Contopee, Symantec researchers say one variant of Contopee uses a custom Secure Sockets Layer implementation—including a set of 75 different ciphers—found in WCry. The OpenSSL crypto library, by comparison, provides more than 300 ciphers, making it unlikely both pieces of malware would offer precisely the same subset.
Security researchers have long warned that attributing hacking operations and malware to specific groups is an imprecise undertaking that's frequently fraught with errors. Readers should keep those caveats front and center as they digest Symantec's findings. Still, the new similarities indicate that industry-wide agreement is growing that Lazarus Group was somehow involved in the WCry outbreak earlier this month. Don't be surprised if additional researchers unearth new similarities.
Far-right opponents of Angela Merkel booed and some brandished the red card as they campaigned in eastern Germany ahead of the September 24th general election

Berlin (AFP)
More than 1,000 criminal complaints for high treason have been filed against German Chancellor Angela Merkel since the height of the refugee crisis in 2015, local media reported Wednesday.
Most of the complaints come from supporters of the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany party, which is poised to win seats in the federal parliament for the first time in next month's general election, the daily Mannheimer Morgen newspaper said.
"The complaints against the chancellor have all been determined to be baseless," a spokesperson for the federal prosecutor's office, Frauke Koehler, told the paper.
Federal prosecutors in the southwestern city of Karlsruhe are responsible for investigating state security offences and are required by law to review all criminal complaints of this nature.
Merkel's decision to let in more than one million asylum seekers in 2015 and 2016 sent support for their conservative Christian Democratic Union party into a nosedive but their support has recovered as new arrivals have dwindled.
They now enjoy a double-digit lead in the polls against their Social Democratic rival Martin Schulz in their bid for a fourth term.
However, AfD supporters have been turning out in force to protest at many of their campaign rallies, particularly in the former communist east of the country.
In Bitterfeld-Wolfen late Tuesday, Merkel was met with a chorus of boos and cries of "get out!".
In a state election last year, the AfD scored around 32 percent of the vote in the city, once the heart of East Germany's chemicals industry.
At a later campaign event in the eastern city of Brandenburg an der Havel, the chancellor was also jeered, with some demonstrators holding signs saying "Merkel must go!", echoing a pro-democracy rallying cry in the late 1980s, "The (Berlin) Wall must go!".
The AfD, which groups extremist anti-Muslim and anti-migrant forces with more moderate voices, is currently polling at between eight and nine percent.

IMAGE: The scene in Jobar in northeast Damascus on Tuesday
Following the rebel defeat of a regime offensive in Daraa Province in southern Syria, headline battles on Tuesday moved to northeast Damascus and to southern Aleppo Province.
Rebels launched fresh attacks on the Syrian military in the Jobar section of Damascus as part of their “Straightening the Lines” offensive, hoping to link up units in Jobar with the Damascus suburbs of Harasta and Qaboun.
Pro-opposition activists claimed that the rebels, including the leading faction Jaish al-Islam, took the Electricity Department and several buildings in the Tiba neighborhood, destroying a tank and capturing heavy and light weapons. They announced the death of several Syrian troops and militia, including a commander in a pro-Assad militia.
The regime responded with airstrikes and tank shelling, as fighting continued through the day. The opposition claims that Syrian forces fired 21 Russian-made BM-30 Smerch missiles with multiple warheads.
Jobar has been held by the opposition since 2012, despite persistent regime bombardment and ground attacks.
Rebels in trenches and tunnels in Jobar:
In southern Aleppo Province in northwest Syria, rebels attacked Syrian forces in the town of al-Rashadiyah, claimed by the regime a week ago.
Rashadiyah is located on the highway from Aleppo city to Khanasser, a key route south into Hama Province.
Pro-Assad outlets say the rebel attacks were repelled, with Syrian troops reinforced by the Palestinian militia Liwa Al-Quds and supported by airstrikes.
New clashes were also reported in the Salaheddin section of Aleppo city, where rebels have been attacking regime positions over the past week.
Report: Jordan Considering No-Fly Zone in Southern Syria
The Jordanian Prime Minister, Abdullah Ensour, has reportedly told journalists that the country is considering the unilateral declaration of a no-fly zone in southern Syria.
The Prime Minister said the safe areas on the Syrian-Jordanian border were needed “to deal with the large influx in the number of Syrian refugees” and a potential humanitarian “disaster”.
The UN said Jordan now has almost 630,000 “persons of concern” in the country. The Prime Minister warned that the total of refugees could soon be more than a million and could reach 2 million if the conflict worsened.
They noted obstacles to the plan, such as the presence of regime forces despite recent rebel victories along teh border and the continuing operations of the Syrian air force. Sources said King Abdullah II will raise the issue with President Obama during a visit to Washington this month.
Rebels Announce Major Offensive on Jisr al-Shughour in Idlib Province
Rebels have announced the next phase of their major offensive in Idlib Province in northwest Syria, declaring a move on Jisr al-Shughour near the Turkish border.
Captain Islam Alloush, the spokesperson for the Islamic Front, posted on Twitter:
Regime outposts around Jisr Al-shughour city are now under Heavy artillery fire paving the way for the ground offensive #Jaishalislam #Syria — C. Islam Alloush (@IslamAllousheng) April 22, 2015
Alloush said the capture of Jisr al-Shughour would open the way to an assault on President Assad's militias in their “home” of the Ghab Plain and Latakia Mountain in western Syria.
Thousands of fighters — unconfirmed claims from activist said 12,000 — are involved in the offensive.
Initial footage of the attacks:

Jisr al-Shughour, with a pre-war population of about 45,000 people, is on the main highway from Aleppo to Latakia on the Mediterranean coast.
The move comes less than a month after rebels took the provincial capital of Idlib city. Since then, fighting has been concentrated south of Idlib, near the regime's Mastoumeh camp and down the main highway to Ariha.
Iranian Commander Killed in Failed Regime Offensive in South
The Iranian outlet ABNA confirms the death of an Iranian commander, Hadi Kajbaf, in this week's fighting in Syria.
Syrian rebels had circulated the news that Kajbaf was killed in a heavy defeat for Syrian forces when they tried to take the town of Busra al-Harir in southern Syria.
A number of Afghan immigrants, sent by Tehran to fight for the Assad regime with promises of money and residency in Iran, were also slain.

Regime Continues Aerial Assault Near Idlib, Deadly Strike on Maarat Num'an
The Syrian air force continues to retaliate for the loss of Idlib city to rebels in late March, with deadly attacks throughout Idlib Province.
Raids on Tuesday included a strike on the town of Maarat Num'an which killed several civilians. Extremely graphic video showed people retrieving body parts from the streets.
A less graphic clip of the aftermath of the airstrike:
In the three weeks since the fall of the provincial capital Idlib, the Syrian air force has tried to break up opposition control by destroying key institutions and services and striking civilians.

Levant Front, Rebel Bloc in Aleppo, Dissolves After 4 Months
The Levant Front, the rebel bloc created in December in Aleppo, has dissolved.
Opposition media reports that the Front's Shura Council made the decision this week. No reason has been given, although analysts are speculating that the break-up is over internal divisions over ideology and tactics.
The Front was made up of five major rebel groups, including the Aleppo wing of the leading rebel bloc, the Islamic Front. It was significant in the defeat of a major regime offensive north of Aleppo in February.
Rebel sources are emphasizing that the dissolution is political and will not affect the joint military operations room among the groups.
Joe Hagan has an epic softball in the New York Magazine describing PapaDick Cheney's plan to salvage their legacy. Or rather, Liz “BabyDick” Cheney's plan to salvage Daddy's legacy, and with it, launch their own career. (At several points, the piece comes close to suggesting PapaDick's mental acuity is finally going the way of their heart.) It relies on such hard-hitting sources as Rush Limbaugh, Elliott Abrams, former Cheney press aide Pete Williams, and Michael Goldfarb saying, “You have a little crush on them … It's hard not to.”
Since I've mentioned Pete Williams, this description of how much NBC loves the Cheneys is one of the best parts of the article.
Fox is a regular pulpit, of course, but Liz is also all over NBC, where they happen to be social friends with Meet the Press host David Gregory (whose wife worked with Liz 's husband at the law firm Latham & Watkins), family friends with Justice Department reporter Pete Williams (Dick Cheney's press aide when they were secretary of Defense), and neighborhood friends with Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski, daughter of Carter-administration national-security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. When Mika criticized Dick Cheney on their show last year, the former vice-president sent them a box of chocolate cupcakes. Lawrence O'Donnell, an MSNBC pundit who engaged in a particularly testy shouting match on Good Morning America with Liz Cheney over waterboarding, says the networks have allowed them a high degree of control over their appearances. “She had up to that point been completely accustomed to having interviews go their way and ceded on their terms,” they observe. “She has been careful to make sure that the interviews worked that way.”
Though somehow Hagan missed the detail from the Libby trial, Cheney's Press Secretary explaining that Cheney got to set the agenda when they appeared on Meet the Press. Under David Gregory's watch, I guess that has only gotten to be more true.
In the whole 8-page article, there's just this hint that BabyDick's constant press assault might be about legal liability for war crimes rather than political legacy (even though PapaDick themselves has talked about statutes of limitation expiring on events they would write about in their memoir).
What inspired their anti-Obama campaign was the administration's release of secret CIA memos detailing the legal rationale, approved by Dick Cheney, for waterboarding, which left open the possibility of criminal prosecutions for former Bush officials and CIA operatives. The Cheneys were apoplectic at the “unprecedented” move, and maybe even afraid of legal blowbacks, having already been stung by the prosecution of Cheney's former chief of staff Scooter Libby, who became ensnared in the CIA-leak investigation of the Valerie Plame affair.
Of course, if Hagan seriously entertained the premise that this was motivated by legal blowback, they might have to look at the obvious factual problems with their arguments. (I assume, however, that Hagan put this story to bed before movement conservatives starting turning on BabyDick's recent McCarthyism.)
And then, finally, there's one of the two genuinely interesting tidbits in the epic article (the other describes BabyDick going AWOL on a conference they set up in Bahrain in November 2005 to go instead to Baghdad, raising questions about what was so important in Baghdad that BabyDick had to babysit Condi–click through to read that one, which appears on page 6).
Though outwardly genial and easygoing, Liz inspired suspicion among their colleagues, who considered them the eyes and ears of the vice-president in the department. Them job gave them a level of clearance for CIA intelligence that allowed them to have conversations with their father about national security, and Liz played information arbiter in internecine government combat. When David Wurmser, a special assistant to John Bolton at the State Department, was asked to fly to Kuwait on the eve of the Iraq War to brief Army general Jay Garner on the search for WMDs, Liz Cheney called Wurmser to warn them that their boss Armitage was going to block their efforts. “She would be very discreet,” says Wurmser. “There was clearly an effort to stop [Bolton], and they thought that was necessary to convey.”
What Hagan describes here, of course, is out and out insubordination (or rather, BabyDick's insubordination layered on top of Bolton's insubordination). But what they also make clear is that not only was BabyDick wired into Bolton's shop (and with it, discussions that would have revealed the genesis of Joe Wilson's trip), but they also helped Wurmser accomplish their two-fold goal of thwarting State Department efforts to set up a broad-based Iraqi government (where OVP pressed Chalabi instead) and of setting up propaganda efforts–complete with their very own NYT shill, Judy Miller–to support claims they had found WMDs.
Not that that should be a surprise. But if you're looking for news in this big blowjob of an article, that's one tidbit of it.
One of the weaknesses of our Senate forecasting model is that, for all the precision we apply to the general election forecasts, we only eyeball the primaries, making estimates about the likelihood of each potential matchup on the basis of the polling and other factors. Nevertheless, we try to be pretty careful. For instance, we had assigned a 25 percent likelihood that Joe Miller would defeat the Republican incumbent, Lisa Murkowski, in Alaska, as happened. We had also assigned small likelihoods to a number of other outcomes that did not come to fruition, like J.D. Hayworth ousting John McCain in Arizona (Mr. McCain won by 24 points) or Chet D. Traylor unseating David Vitter in Louisiana (Mr. Vitter won by 81).
But in the case of Christine O'Donnell, who defeated Michael N. Castle in the Republican Senate primary in Delaware last night, it hadn't even occurred to me to add that possibility to the model until a few weeks ago. Mr. Castle had been elected statewide 12 times — twice as governor, once as lieutenant governor and nine times as Delaware's at-large United States representative. Ms. O'Donnell had run for Senate twice before — in the Republican primary in 2006 and in the general election in 2008 — and lost badly both times.
I'm not saying that we would have carefully considered Ms. O'Donnell's case and assigned it zero probability. Rather, it wasn't something I had thought about at all — in the same way that one doesn't think about a strong earthquake occurring unless one lives in California.
In fairness, primary elections can have a self-fulfilling quality to them, and until Mr. Miller beat Ms. Murkowski in Alaska three weeks ago, Ms. O'Donnell probably wasn't on the minds of a lot of voters either. Ms. O'Donnell's major endorsements, like that from Sarah Palin, came late in the race; before that, some key conservative groups like FreedomWorks had deliberately declined to endorse her, fearing that they aren't electable.
Nevetheless, Ms. O'Donnell's victory — like Scott Brown's in Massachusetts this year, or Hillary Rodham Clinton's in the New Hampshire primary two years ago — was an emphatic reminder that voters write the script. The rest of us self-proclaimed political professionals — journalists and pollsters, activists and bundlers, lobbyists and party-leaders, presidents and senators — are just the stagehands.
So what does this mean as we head into November — and beyond?
There are some fairly tangible conclusions. For instance, Ms. O'Donnell's win almost certainly reduces the possibility of a Republican takeover of the Senate. They could still defeat the Democrat in the race, Chris Coons — as Mr. Castle could have lost to him. But on the basis of the polling (and here we are, thankfully, again on solid empirical ground) the Republicans went from being extremely likely to win the race to extremely likely to lose it. They may now need to bring another state like Connecticut or West Virginia into play to have a decent chance of taking the Senate; indeed, I would expect to hear a lot of chatter about opportunities like these, as the Republican establishment seems ready to concede Delaware.
Another conclusion, of course, is that the Tea Party is a mixed blessing for the Republicans. Undoubtedly, in my view, they have done the party more good than harm over the past year and a half, bringing it back from what pundits assumed was the brink of irrelevance (but may instead just have been the nadir of a political cycle), to a position where they are poised to make electoral gains that could rival or exceed 1994.
But in order to achieve those gains — not a fairly ordinary gain of 20, 30 or even 40 House seats, but the earth-shattering, upside results that Republicans are dreaming about — they will need for three basic things to happen. First, they will need a solid majority of independent voters to select their candidates. Second, they will need the Democratic base to be uninterested in the election. And third, they will need their own base to be enthused.
For a number of reasons — but foremost the condition of the economy and the Democrats' seeming inability to craft a winning message around it — the first factor seems almost certain to be in place for Republicans, and it is probably too late for Democrats to do much to change it. And this shows up plenty well in the polling; President Obama's approval rating among independents is under 40 percent in many polls, for instance.
The second factor — Democratic disinterest — is the most uncertain of the three, and has probably been taken somewhat too much for granted by analysts. One should keep in mind that, even in an ordinary midterm election year, this factor tends to cut against the Democrats, since some key groups in their constituency, like young voters and Hispanics, traditionally vote in lower numbers in these elections. But whether Democratic participation will be merely average for a midterm year, or quite a bit worse than that, is unclear. Late in a political cycle, it tends to be easier to motivate a voter than to persuade him, and the Democrats do have some rallying points with their base like the health care bill (even if they are hush-hush about some of the same points when independents are in the room). They also have, as a consequence of the huge reach of President Obama's campaign in 2008, good voter lists and databases. There is actually some evidence that Democrats closed their enthusiasm gap late in the 2009 races for governor in New Jersey and the Senate in Massachusetts, even if they ultimately lost them. And the Democrats have won a couple of elections with strong base support, like the special election in May in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District. Still, the pluralistic nature of the Democratic base tends to make it harder to rally, and much of the party's work — even if it were eventually to succeed — remains to be done.
The final factor — Republican engagement — also seems like something of a foregone conclusion. There is little doubt that many on the right view November's election as one of historic importance. But, after last night, this factor may need to be read with a bit more nuance. What conservative voters seem to be most engaged by is their distaste for the establishment. But they seem to be somewhat equal-opportunity in this respect, disliking the Republican establishment nearly as much as the Democratic one. So even though in Florida, Republicans have nominated a fresh and compelling face in Marco Rubio, what happens in Ohio, where they have nominated a familiar and establishment candidate in Rob Portman? Or in Illinois, where they have nominated Mark Kirk, who is both establishment and quite moderate? Will Republican voters have the same gusto — and turn out in the same numbers — for these candidates? In Mr. Portman's case, it might not matter — they are doing well enough with independents that he's liable to win, even with mediocre base participation. But for someone like a Mr. Kirk, or a Dino Rossi in Washington, Republicans could find that their “enthusiasm gap” isn't as large as they were expecting.
To some extent, the Republicans' problem is nothing new. Parties often face a trade-off between nominating more extreme candidates, who may have more appeal to the party base, and more moderate ones who may have greater appeal to independents. Arguably, it is a decent problem to have; at least the Republicans know their voters are fired up about something (it's just a question of whether it might be harnessed in quite the right way), which is less certain for the Democrats.
Still, there's the possibility that Republicans end up with a lot of half-loaves: independent voters get them almost close enough in some states and districts, base voters in some others, but they come up a few points short in a lot of key races and wind up winning “only” 30 House seats and 4 or 5 Senate seats. Or just the opposite could be true. Independent voters rally them to surprising wins in some blue-leaning states, while base voters shore up the home front and allow them to roll back the gains Democrat made in 2006 and 2008.
But some analysts are making forecasts that seem imprudent, especially after last night. For instance, the Republican pollster Steve Lombardo suggested without qualification yesterday that “Republicans will win the House,” and the Weekly Standard's Jay Cost set an over-under line of a gain of 57 House seats.
Indeed, it's considerably more likely than not that Republicans will win the House (we place the odds at about 2 to 1 in their favor), and the achievement of a 57-seat (or larger) gain is quite distinctly possible. Both Mr. Lombardo and Mr. Cost are smart observers, and neither tend to be cheerleaders.
But the degree of certainty that their claims imply is not warranted by history — including very recent history.
PAY THE PIPER: Hate preacher can't be heard over the sound of teenage bagpiper
Daniel Boyle, 14, played Scotland The Brave to drown out the man whose anti-gay ranting was angering people in nearby cafes and bars in Market Street, St Andrews on Saturday.
The Scottish crowd cheered as the schoolboy's music overpowered the preacher, who was shouting through a small amplifier.
They said: “People were trying to get them to be quiet. I had my bagpipes in my dad's car and someone suggested drowning them out so I got them and started playing.
“There was a crowd of about 200 people and everyone started cheering. Everyone started cheering. It was great.”
Daniel, of Bathgate, West Lothian, and their dad Matthew had stopped off in the town centre on their way home to the family caravan at Kinkell Braes and customers at the Keys Bar were complaining about the hollering.
Locals said it was difficult to hear what the preacher was saying but that their tone was aggressive and was ruining the atmosphere.
19-year-old Saudi sprinter Abdullah Abkar Mohammed will represent the Kingdom the the most prestigious event of the Summer Olympics — the 100m sprint.
First Olympics For Record-Holding Sprinter
At the 58th Mt SAC Relays in April 2016 in Norwalk, California, Mohammed set a national record and Asian junior record with their 10.04 victory in the 100m, followed by winning an open section of the 200m in 20.29 seconds. Mohammed's Asian junior record also makes them the world's fastest sprinter currently under the age of 20.  They are the youngest sprinter to qualify for the Rio Games.
Following their competition at the 2016 IAAF World Indoor Championship, where they set a personal best of 6.64 seconds in the 60m, Abdullah Abkar Mohammed gave a brief interview.
Abkar is from Madinah, and started their journey with Al-Alnsar national club. Soon after, they moved to Riyadh and moved between national clubs. Before even participating in national games, Abkar was chosen by the Federation to enter the Saudi team. Their training this year started in Mecca, then Jeddah and Dammam, and they finally settled in America with the international trainer, John Smith.
Saudi National coach (Al-Alansar club), Abdul Rahman Asiri, told Al-Yaum newspaper “Abdullah is one of the talents that were discovered during school athletics competitions, and we expected a good future for them [with us], but they moved to Riyadh. They still visit Al-Ansar club when they are in Medina.  They are persistent, and they are fast and strong, I am sure that they still have more to offer the team»
Abdullah expressed their joy for qualifying to Rio in 2016, as they have been preparing for this moment for a while, including intensive training in Brazil and the United States through several long and various camps, all this led to achieving their aspiration [qualifying to Rio 2016]. They pointed out that reaching this was not difficult, but they now, has the responsibility of maintaining it, and strives to achieve greater achievements. They ensure that their participation in the Olympics will be great. While they will be competing with the best world runners, they are determined to offer a great and honorable image of Saudi runners, and will work towards a better record than the one they broke in Mt. SAC.
The American coach of the Saudi track team, John Smith, assured that the Saudi team has many young talents, who could have great presence in international competitions. They stressed that the Saudi athletes in sprinting, “have a big desire and ability to train, and passion and enthusiasm to succeed. This, certainly, makes the trainer's job easier.”

Side gig for Greinke: Draft advisor
MLB.com/blogs Blocked Unblock Follow Feb 25, 2012
By Adam McCalvy
Here's a new role for Brewers ace Zack Greinke: Draft advisor.
Brewers principal owner Mark Attanasio was praising Greinke's intelligence and awareness when they revealed Saturday that Greinke asked for video of prospective Brewers Draft picks last May. They studied different pitchers and offered recommendations before the Brewers selected pitchers Taylor Jungmann and Jed Bradley in the first round of the First-Year Player Draft.
Greinke is more involved than some fans think, Attanasio said. They recommended that coaches save bunt defense for later in camp, so the coaches made some slight alterations to the schedule.
“We had a nice laugh about that,” Attanasio said. “He's a very thoughtful guy.”
Greinke is a free agent at season's end, and the Brewers are formulating a plan for contract extension talks. Attanasio declined to offer specifics of that plan, did address the fact that Greinke, for now, is acting as their own agent.
“Zack is a very smart guy,” Attanasio said. “He's very aware of things that are going on.”

Reeling from days of controversy, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump met Wednesday with the families ​of troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan ​to hear their concerns about the campaign and broader national security issues.
The private conference, which attendees said lasted about 30 minutes before a rally in Florida, included top Trump defense advis ​er retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and was organized by Karen Vaughn, the mother of a fallen Navy SEAL and a featured speaker at last month's Republican convention. Ten parents, siblings and spouses of fallen service members were included.
"It was really a chance to tell our stories, but also talk about problems with the rules of engagement [for troops in war zones] and the failed policies of the current administration," Vaughn said. "I walked out feeling like I understood where their heart is, regardless of the comments that they made that may seem insensitive to some."
Trump has received significant criticism in recent days from political opponents, veterans groups and even fellow Republicans for their remarks in response to a Democratic convention speech delivered by Khizr Khan, the Muslim father of a soldier killed in Iraq in 2004.
Yes, those are mermaid fairies.Aaaaand this one is for ! It's the second Kiriban for the thing I did like last week! They said they like mermaids or fairies, and my brain said WHY NOT BOTH LOL O__O Like, like fish they'd live in rivers, but instead of jumping up the waterfalls, they'd jump down! Since they can fly and all. Err... isn't that... really cool? No? But it was fun! Like the last one sooo stylized, but fun! Even though I had a lot of trouble with the colors. I like how the skin turned out and I like the pinks and purples in the tree and fish, but some other parts are kinda messed up :IAh well, I'll do better next time!Here's a version without the trollfish: [link] Steps and layered psd file!Aaaand the usual info, PS CS3, no refs, a couple of days Ö_Ö Longer than the last one, I guess 3-4 days in total.Cheers!Hannes
Justin Bieber Collapses In London HOSPITALIZED
Justin Bieber Collapses In London -- Hospitalized
Exclusive Details
-- We're told Justin has been released from the hospital. They feel crappy, but still plans on going ahead with tonight's show.was taken to a hospital in London moments ago ... after collapsing backstage during a concert ... TMZ has learned.A source close to Justin tells us the singer felt woozy during the show at the O2 Arena ... and with 4 songs to go, they stumbled backstage where they collapsed.We're told the singer was pulled into a private room where they were treated with oxygen from emergency personnel.Sources say Bieber was advised to go to the hospital ... but declined ... insisting that they "had to finish the show for their fans."That's when Bieber's rep, Scooter Braun, went on stage and told the crowd ... "Justin's got very light breath. The whole show he's been complaining, He's backstage with the EMTs and the doctor."
A short time later, JB returned to the stage ... completed the show ... and got a HUGE ovation.Justin was transported to the hospital directly following the show ... and we're told he's still there receiving treatment.We're told he's in good spirits and feels OK ... but doctors want to evaluate him.
You're wrong if you think the United States men's national soccer team got "screwed." "Screwed" implies someone taking your job after some country club negotiations and white-collar chicanery. "Screwed" is you, staring at a hospital bill you and your descendants won't be able to pay. "Screwed" is for schnooks, losers, and bumpkins outflanked by the cruel, plotting hands of The Man living high in their mansion on the hill.
You got a beautiful goddamned gift in getting utterly and completely f----d by FIFA
No, United States soccer fans, you did not get "screwed." You got a beautiful goddamned gift in getting utterly and completely f----d by FIFA. This is always act one of the movie. This is you failing at the dance-off and getting served. This is Brad Wesley bulldozing the one man in town who stood up to him. This is the owner turning off the cold water, putting you on buses, and daring you to win the league before they close shop and takes the whole operation to Miami. You just lost your first street race, but you'll be damned if you aren't gonna live your life a quarter mile at a time.
Oh you have been given a gift: a spot at the bottom of a pit with Ghana, Germany, and Portugal standing right on your back to start the fight. Sepp Blatter stands at the lip of the pit, laughing at you and drinking a Coca-Cola laced with human growth hormone and whatever else keeps their evil, grinning corpse clinging to life. You have been given the sweetest of motivations: revenge against the shadowy, foreign-ish illuminati who pull the strings of existence with malevolent intent.
You'll have to take them on one by one.
Germany? Jurgen Klinsmann molded them. They know their cheat codes, and has married this U.S. team's ability to produce mediocre rap albums with the precision of a German machine. He's our daywalker, a soccer Blade who knows how these sunless vampires work from the inside-out. You might think I'm saying that German soccer players are machines, and that Klinsmann will infect them with a computer virus disabling their ability to attack us?
It worked in Independence Day. You're not laughing anymore. You're believing, and that's the first step.
Ghana? Sure, they've beaten us two World Cups in a row, but defeat's never meant yielding the fight for Americans, a people locked in fierce contest with all of the following indomitable opponents:
Obesity
The History Channel
An inability to use turn signals, ever
Turkey fryers
Herpes
Poverty
Drake
Squirrels
Flossing regularly
The werewolf we must, by curse, fight each and every night behind the QT until one of us is knocked unconscious
Science
We as a nation are winless against all of these -- AND YET WE FIGHT. Because we must. We fight because AMERICA. We probably won't beat Ghana because that's not something we seem to do, but whatever. You're our "spouse-fight over whether you put peanut butter in the fridge or not," Ghana, and like so many other battles we'll keep up the argument no matter how doomed it might be.
Portugal's easy. They are beautiful, talented, and as fragile as elderly herons in a stiff breeze when adversity strikes. Oooooooh, but Ronaldo is so impossibly beautiful. Our forefathers were ugly bastards with wooden teeth, syphilis, and smallpox scars, and our current national hero is Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is not pretty: they are ruggedly handsome, they tried to save the world from the earnest tyranny of John Cena and they ruled Egypt as the Scorpion King.
This war's over before it even started, Portugal. Call them anything but "Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson" and we'll alter the terms of your premature surrender to the harshest degree imaginable. Now go cry into pillows made of your chief export, cork, you beautiful, frangible Iberians.
You shouldn't even be allowed to complain about travel, America. Yes, you have to go to Manaus, the swampy capital of Brazil's hellishly hot Amazonian jungle territory. But you're from America, where we have a whole state of Amazonian swampland filled with danger. It's called Florida, and it's where we send our old people, vacationing children, and charismatic felons. Manaus is just Orlando with a port, attractive people and health care. Our people fly thousands of miles a day just to smell its well-vacuumed hotels. Fear nothing about it, since it's practically home already, and getting there involves one of the things we do best: sitting.
You need to do what great Americans have done for years, USMNT: resort to brazen theft. You need to steal this World Cup. You see that man in the Ronaldo jersey shining? Get them off those goddamn diamonds. You don't like Germany? Take their rings off, then. We don't complain about our literal lot in this World Cup life, America. We ante the f--- up until we're selling Sepp Blatter's minks on eBay and maxing out their credit cards on room service champagne.
You're right where all heroes start: hopeless, f----d, and with no choice but to turn the hell up. SO TURN UP, USMNT.
Whether or not you know about or care to use the mathematical coordinate systems described in the last post, it seems that our eyes and brains already make use of them when seeing and hallucinating. How this is the case will be explained here in some detail. Of course, our senses are intricately correlated with the dynamics of our brains in ways so complex that we can barely understand or even comprehend them at all, but there are still ways to reason and model (however crude they may be) the workings of such phenomenon.
Visual hallucinations are a universal human experience which occur in varying degrees in different circumstances–from when we rub or apply pressure to our eyes to more extreme instances like when we are under the influence of psychoactive drugs. What we “see” when we hallucinate is ultimately a unique subjective experience, but there does seem to be some objective similarities amongst reported hallucinations. Some of these hallucinations appear to be fixed in the visual field and do not change as we look around. Moreover, they can even be experienced when the eyes are closed, and have also been reported by people who are blind. This gives reason to believe that the source or cause of these hallucinations may be independent of what we really see and receive as sensory input from the external world, and instead originate on a deeper level within the brain itself.
Studies suggest that a certain region of the brain, the visual cortex (also known as V1), plays a primary role in the processing of visual information. There is a correspondence from what we see in the visual field with our eyes to the neural activity in parts of V1. Spatial input of light and dark on the eyes is translated to “light/dark” regions of high/low neural activity in V1. Basically, images form certain patterns on the retinas of our eyes which are then converted to related patterns on the visual cortex in our brains leading to the perception of the image.
To describe more rigorously the nature of this image translation from the eyes to the brain, we can use mathematics and coordinate systems to define a coordinate mapping between the visual field to the V1 region of the brain. Such a transformation was modeled by J. D. Cowan and G. B, Ermentrout in their 1979 paper “A Mathematical theory of Visual Hallucinations”. A simplified version capturing the essence of their model is described in what fallows.
Interpreting the visual field as a two-dimensional plane, let's use polar coordinates to label points in the visual field. The center of the visual field is taken as the origin of the coordinate system so that a point P in the visual field is described by a pair of numbers P = ( r , a ), where r is the distance of the point P to the center of the visual field and a is the relative angle the point makes with respect to some fixed axis.
Now we need a way a described how points in the visual field correspond to points in the V1 region of the brain, but first we need a way to label points in the V1 region. To do this, we model the V1 region as another two-dimensional flat plane. This time, let's use the normal Cartesian coordinate system to label the points in V1 as pairs of numbers ( x , y ).
The coordinate mapping constructed here will tell us how a point in the visual field, labelled as P = ( r , a ) in polar coordinates, gets translated to the corresponding point in the V1 region of the brain labelled as ( x , y ) in Cartesian coordinates. This ( x , y ) point in V1 is given in terms of the r and a coordinate of the visual field through the relationship
( x , y ) = ( ln r , a ),
where ln r is the natural logarithm of r.
Thus, the point that is given by the polar coordinates ( r , a ) in the visual field is mapped to the corresponding point in V1 whose Cartesian coordinate has a horizontal component of ln r and a vertical component of a. This transformation can be interpreted as log-polar coordinates, and may be recognized as the complex logarithm. We can now use this coordinate transformation to describe the shapes of certain hallucinations.
Normally, we actually receive sensory input through the visual field and corresponding neural patterns are triggered in our brains which result in the perception of whatever we are seeing. The model explained here explains the existence of hallucinations by an opposite mechanism. Without even receiving real sensory input through the visual field, V1 can still be a brain region with high neural activity (perhaps more so when on certain drugs). These patterns of neural activity in V1 may be perceived as if one is actually seeing a pattern in the visual field, but they are really just hallucinations. In the 1920s, psychologist Heinrich Klüver researched themselves and others while having ingested mescaline (more info here) in the form of peyote buttons and attempted to classify the visual hallucinations they experienced. The observed hallucinations manifesting themselves as geometrical patterns were classified into four types and were referred to as form constants: 1) tunnels, 2) spirals, 3) cobwebs, and 4) lattices.
The coordinate transformation just described between the visual field and the V1 region of the visual cortex is successful in explaining the occurrence of the form constants.
1) Vertical or horizontal stripes stripes of neural activity on the V1 region may look something like this:
Applying the coordinate transformation in the reverse direction, we see that vertical stripes get mapped to circles in the visual field and horizontal stripes get mapped to rays emanating out from the center of the visual field:
2) Stripes of neural activity in V1 in arbitrary directions such as these diagonals
get mapped to spirals in the visual field:
3) Combinations of stripes such as these vertical and horizontal ones
would then get mapped to patterns that resemble cobwebs:
4) Neural activity in V1 is not limited to stripes. There may be activity with certain lattice symmetries like these checkerboard or honeycomb patterns
which would get mapped to hallucinations that appear like these
This model and these examples are idealized cases, but serve to approximate what may be happening in our brains when certain hallucinations occur. Despite having empirical applications in this context, the coordinate transformation described here can be freely applied to any image resulting in transformed images that still manage to express a psychedelic aesthetic (see here for some examples).
If you ever wondered when or why you would use polar coordinates I hope this post serves as a justifiable application. Conversely, I do not necessarily justify the use of psychedelics to help understand what you are learning in your math lessons.
This post was inspired by these papers, which explain what was attempted here and more in much greater detail:

A man who dropped an eight-kilogram concrete platypus on their gay housemate as they beat them to death has been sentenced to 18 years' jail.
Aaron James Johnstone, 29, said they lost control after their drunk housemate Phillip Higgins, 46, propositioned them in September 2006.
They told police they kicked and punched Mr Higgins before dropping the platypus statue on him. They also struck them with a chair.
Johnstone was sentenced to 18 years' jail with a minimum term of 14 years at the Victorian Supreme Court today.
Justice Robert Osborn described the injuries suffered by Mr Higgins, which included six broken ribs and a battered face, as horrific.
They said Johnstone moved into the rented flat of Mr Higgins and was their friend for some years.
"Your attack was a savage betrayal of their trust and generosity," Justice Osborn said.
They said that even if Mr Higgins made advances towards their friend, their reaction was outside of what an ordinary person would do.
"I do not accept that even if Mr Higgins had made homosexual advances to you in the terms you now assert, the ordinary person might be so provoked to totally lose control and do what you did," they said.
The judge said they took into account that Johnstone was affected by alcohol at the time of the bashing, their conduct was followed by some degree of remorse and they were relatively cooperative with police.
Zapatero tells Pope ‘Spain is secular'
The Spanish Prime Minister Zapatero reminded the Pope last week that Spain is a secular state after the pontiff attacked Government legislation on abortion, gay marriage and divorce.
Just as they did in the UK, the Pope started their attack on Spain's “aggressive secularism” as soon as they arrived in the country, blaming it for the rise of fascism. They said there were comparisons between the anti-clericalism now and the anti-clericalism in the civil war – which has resulted in thousands of priests being assassinated in the run up to the civil war. Just as their comments about atheism and the Nazi regime had sparked outrage in Britain, so their re-writing of Spanish history caused an outcry there.
Left-wingers described the remarks as misguided given that the Spanish Government spends €6 billion (£5 billion) each year on financial support for the Church and recently shelved a law which would have given equal rights to other religions. “The Pope's comments are an insult and an affront to Spanish democracy,” said Juanma Romero, of the United Left Party.
Gay marriage has been embraced by many Spaniards, seeing 20,000 unions in the past five years. And the pope's message, while cheered by tens of thousands of the faithful, met with opposition from many others.
The daily newspaper El Pais said of the visit: “The Pope has set themselves the Herculean task of combating the unstoppable development of secularisation in Europe – a process for which Spain has become the centre of operations, strangely enough. Ratzinger's over-the-top approach resulted in a missed opportunity to build bridges between the Church and the state.”
From the heartland of Catholic Germany, Süddeutsche Zeitung said that whoever advised Benedict XVI in the course of their trip to Spain did them “a great disservice”. The Munich daily condemned as “fatal” the Pontiff's comparison of contemporary anti-clericalism with that in the run up to the civil war, as the Second Spanish Republic attempted to limit the role of the Church. It shows that the Vatican is still eager to hide the true story of an “aggressive and murderous Spanish clergy too happy to give a leg-up to Francoist fascism.” But “why is Benedict XVI bringing all of this up now? Because in terms of social legislation, Spain has entered the modern world. Gay marriage, divorce without an interminable waiting period, abortion, and sex education – in the eyes of the Vatican, this is the catalogue of sin for which Spain is unable to atone.”
The Pope grumbled about the lack of religion in the Czech Republic, citing it as a prime example of the “marginalisation” of Christianity in Europe. But the Lidové Noviny newspaper conducted a poll that showed that the Czechs are not quite as anti-Catholic as the Pope would have us believe – but they are definitely anti-Ratzinger. The paper also argues that the Pope's concerns over “the growing spiritual void in Europe, which will open the door to Islam,” are groundless. On the contrary, Lidové Noviny believes that “Islam is less likely to develop in the Czech Republic than in a country where Catholicism is a living force.”
The Spanish Prime Minister met briefly with the Pope at Barcelona airport just before the pontiff departed for Rome and, according to a statement from their office, diplomatically suggested that Spain had a smooth relationship with the Vatican. But the premier added that ties with the Vatican were based on the constitution, which states Spain is a “secular state which recognises the weight of the Catholic Church in Spain but guarantees the freedom of all.” As if to exemplify the tensions between church and state, the Queen took communion with the Pope while the King did not.
Zapatero also said that their Government would “co-operate fully” with the Pope's next visit to Spain, which will be for World Youth Day in Madrid next August, and which will cost the country — already struggling under the weight of 20% unemployment and vast debts — very dearly.
When President Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in November, many pundits assumed the so-called Clinton dynasty was over.
Fast forward just a few months, and media outlets are apparently #ReadyForChelsea – despite the former first daughter's carefully worded denials about eyeing public office.
The rumor mill has been kept busy, it seems, thanks to little more than an uptick in social media activity by Chelsea. Within 24 hours last week, three major pieces were published about them
The New York Times published in its style section: “Now on Twitter: Chelsea Clinton, Unbound.” In covering their social media commentary, the article asked in a tone more akin to “Sex and the City's” Carrie Bradshaw – “can a tweet ever be just a tweet?”
“I am not running for office.” — Chelsea Clinton
The piece noted that while those close to them furiously have denied a political run is in the works, “Ms. Clinton is still a Clinton.”
“She may be their own person — a 37-year-old mother of two, an activist — but they remain the only child of President Bill Clinton and Mrs. Clinton, the first female presidential candidate of a major political party,” the article said.
They persisted.
On the West Coast, the Los Angeles Times published an opinion piece the same day by Ann Friedman called, “Just like their mother, Chelsea Clinton never gets a break.” The article noted that “although Chelsea recently tried to quash rumors that they will seek Kirsten Gillibrand's New York Senate seat if Gillibrand runs for president in 2020, that hasn't stopped people from reading the tea leaves to predict what she'll do next.”
Focusing on a recent controversy over the awarding of an "impact award" to Clinton by Lifetime, Friedman said Clinton is treated poorly and much worse than current first daughter Ivanka Trump.
“But Chelsea, like their mother, never gets a break — unlike Ivanka and their father,” Friedman said of Clinton – who once earned a $600,000 salary as a special contributor for NBC News.
A day later, Vice News published an article titled: “The Agony and Ecstasy of Chelsea Clinton Fans,” featuring a mock-up of Chelsea as a Catholic saint. The article interviewed Chelsea "fans," including Texas resident Nick Stevens who said: "Hillary is Queen, Bae, Beyoncé—you get it. Chelsea is the prodigy—2.0, if you will."
This is not a new phenomenon. Earlier this month, Clinton tweeted out a picture of their spinach pancakes they were making for Pancake Day. BuzzFeed, The Washington Post, Boston Globe, The Huffington Post, ABC News (and yes, Fox News) all covered this event.
(And yes, the writer of this article is aware that, by covering the coverage of Chelsea Clinton's non-run for non-office, the writer is also contributing to said coverage.)
Some outlets have gone further than others. Diligent Twitter user neontaster, meanwhile, drew up a list of all the stories The Hill had written about the former first daughter, and found 70 times the D.C. outlet had tweeted about Clinton.
Here is every 2017 tweet from @thehill that includes the words "Chelsea Clinton." pic.twitter.com/PuLQlSmPjf — neontaster (@neontaster) March 7, 2017
After a pause of six days, neontaster declared victory.
Thirty minutes after their tweet, The Hill put up a story about the award from Lifetime.
Not all media voices are keen on Chelsea's buzz, and a blog post for The Washington Post last week argued, “The best thing Chelsea Clinton could do for their political future is to disappear.”
Additionally, some of their tweets have met with a resounding thud. Earlier this week, Clinton asked if a Twitter image featuring President Lincoln wearing a “Make America Great Again” cap was photoshopped, leading to some mockery from conservative tweeters.
Please tell me this is photoshopped. Please? https://t.co/WezDQx6IvT — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) March 25, 2017
As for Chelsea herself, they offered a typically Clintonian non-denial denial. Speaking to Variety magazine, they said: “I am not running for office.” After the apparently definitive statement, they noted that they love the New York city councilwoman, member of congress, and both senators in New York. Then they added:
“If someone steps down or something changes, I'll then ask and answer those questions at that time. But right now, no, I'm not running for public office.”
The England and Wales Cricket Board confirmed on Monday night hard-hitting opener Alex Hales is now eligible for England selection but allrounder Ben Stokes remains "unavailable".
Hales was suspended by the ECB for their alleged involvement in a brawl outside a Bristol nightclub in September that saw Ben Stokes arrested on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm.
QUICK SINGLE Late carnage gives England a sniff
While Stokes' short-term international future and Magellan Ashes participation remains clouded, Hales is now fit for an England recall should the selectors give them a nod.
"Alex Hales will now be considered for England selection, following confirmation that they are no longer a suspect in relation to an incident in Bristol in September," an ECB statement read.
"The ECB Board has convened via conference call to make the decision after being informed that Hales is deemed a witness and will face no charges.
"The independent Cricket Discipline Commission [CDC] has stayed the internal disciplinary process for both Alex Hales and Ben Stokes until the conclusion of any potential criminal proceedings relating to the incident."
Day wrap: Aussies on top but empire strikes back
Hale is now in line to be included in England's ODI squad for the five-match Gillette ODI Series in January, which will likely be announced at the conclusion of the second Test in Adelaide.
The 28-year-old has also received a 'No Objection Certificate' to play in the inaugural T10 Cricket League in Dubai from December 21, just as Stokes was allowed to play in New Zealand yesterday in the local domestic 50-over competition.
Stokes made two and recorded figures of 0-49 from nine overs with the ball in their cricket comeback with Canterbury against Otago.
BEIRUT, Lebanon — To the overnight editor at the Arab affairs website, it looked like big news: Kuwait, apparently following the lead of President Trump, had issued a visa ban on citizens from five other predominantly Muslim countries.
The editor wrote an article, and the news rocketed through cyberspace. One link caught the eye of Mr. Trump himself, who shared it on their official Facebook page with a word of praise for the reported policy: “Smart!”
But there was a problem: The Kuwait ban was from 2011, long before Mr. Trump announced a similar measure in the United States, said James Brownsell, the managing editor of The New Arab, the site that produced that article on Feb. 1. Their writer did not notice that the news was years old.
Many sites that often support Mr. Trump and also published the report, including Infowars.com and Russia's Sputnik news agency, have since clarified that it was outdated and unrelated to Mr. Trump's order.
The European Central Bank was checking up on how well Greece is meeting its international bailout obligations today, a day after Germany's finance minister said a third aid programme would be needed to keep Athens afloat.
Joerg Asmussen, a member of the ECB's executive board, was to meet Greece' prime minister, finance minister and central bank governor, and to have talks with Greek business leaders.
Their immediate concern is with the next tranche of aid from Greece's second international bailout, due in October.
But their visit was announced the same day that German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told an election campaign audience that Greece will need a third bailout on top of rescue loans worth about €240 billion already obtained for 2010-2014.
A Greek finance ministry official said any further help for Greece would aim to cover its funding shortfall in 2014-2016 and would be much smaller than the previous aid packages, given the country's limited funding needs for the period.
The International Monetary Fund has put Greece's uncovered funding needs for 2014-2015 at €10.9 billion.
At least part of that shortfall stems from national European central banks refusing to roll over part of the Greek bonds they hold.
Such estimates are revised frequently and are highly sensitive to budget and economic growth projections, which Greece's lenders are expected to update in the fall.

Extra info Supernova: Theorycraft, Discussion, Prediction
I have mixed feelings about the Supernova. I am glad that we are getting another 90-ton jumpjetting clan mech, as the only other one we have is the Highlander IIC, which I am still disappointed in. Originally I was going to call it a failure, but I felt like that might be a bit too harsh...still, there are a couple of huge shortcomings that made me feel a bit burned by the Highlander IIC. The first was its agility: the relatively low engine cap of 325 made piloting the mech a real pain for me. It's not at the same level as the Dire Wolf, but the torso twist speed, accel/decel, and just the speed in general are all pretty bad; all of which exacerbate the issues that it has with poor hitboxes.
The other issue I had with the Highlander IIC was in terms of its weaponry. A couple of variants have pretty formidable loadouts, but the positioning of the hardpoints made it tough to put something truly threatening together, and the impressive amount of available tonnage was just wasted.
Looking at the Supernova...it definitely falls victim to both of these issues, if in different ways. As far as the agility issue goes, we're looking at a repeat performance, as it has the same engine cap. It's possible that this issue could be solved in quirks (though even the HGN-IIC-C's fairly extreme agility quirks don't feel like enough), but I doubt it based on recent trends. The saving grace could be that the Supernova's profile looks much more forgiving than the Highlander IIC's, which could be good news for its hitboxes. And if its hitboxes are good, the agility issues become less of a viability issue and more of a QoL one.
The thing that scares me on the firepower front is how energy-centric these variants are. The KDK-1 and KDK-5 proved that, after a certain tonnage, clan energy weapons just don't cut it. Energy weapons are the tonnage-savers, so it's hard to fill up an Assault mech with them, and you end up needing more heatsinks than you have slots for. Plus, the long durations of clan lasers make your large mech even more vulnerable to focus fire, and ghost heat only makes the situation worse.
Of course, not all of the variants are pure energy boats. There's one that serves as a missile boat with only 4 missile hardpoints (not enough for an Assault mech to brawl with, but I'm sure many people will be LRMing it up), and the hero...with two ballistics. Which is pretty much guaranteed to be by far the best variant. I will be impressed if any of the others even come close. Which is another thing that has me concerned about this pack - the variant that I expect to be the best is the Hero, and the next-best is in the reinforcement pack. Which drives me up a wall.
So let's talk about the mechs themselves.
Builds
SNV-1
Standard Structure, Standard Armor (69 per leg, max elsewhere), XL325 (62.9KPH), 3 JJs
2x cLPL (1 per arm)
6x cERML (3 per arm)
27 DHS, TC4 4 energy hardpoints in each arm. Doesn't get much straightforward than that! This is definitely the most Nova-like variant in regards to hardpoints, but the build does end up looking a tad bit different. It does hit pretty much the maximum ghost-heat-less longest-range laser alpha, but it's still going to be hot and those arms aren't exactly high.
SNV-3
Endo, Standard Armor (max everywhere), XL325 (62.9KPH), 3 JJs
4x cLPL (2 per arm)
3x cERML (2 in CT, 1 in head)
24 DHS, TC2 This one's a bit more extreme. The idea is that you can corner-peak on either side with 3 cERMLs and 2 cLPLs, which is pretty heavy duty. And your full alpha strike is also intense, as long as you don't ghost heat alpha strike and shut down. But it's gonna be hot as balls anyway.
SNV-A
Standard Structure, Standard Armor (69 per leg, max elsewhere), XL325 (62.9KPH), 3 JJs
4x SRM6 w/ Artemis (2 per side torso) and 5 tons of ammo
4x cMPL (2 per arm)
25 DHS, TC1 I'm sure that most people will be playing this mech as a LRM boat, and I don't blame them for it (it's probably going to be better in that role), but something like this is more my speed. Keeps up pretty decent firepower at short range, and the alpha strike is pretty sweet (80 damage!). Probably my third-most anticipated variant.
SNV-B
Standard Structure, Standard Armor (69 per leg, max elsewhere), XL325 (62.9KPH), 3 JJs
8x cMPL (3 per arm, 1 in CT, 1 in head)
27 DHS, TC6 Very similar hardpoints to the SNV-3, but with one less energy in the CT and one added to each arm. Which means you can corner-peak either side with 5 cMPLs or fire both arms for 6, which is pretty nice. Not great for an Assault, but the TC6 is sure to help.
SNV-C
Standard Structure, Standard Armor (37 per arm, max elsewhere), XL325 (62.9KPH)
4x cERPPC (2 per side torso)
2x Flamer (1 per arm)
30 DHS, TC1 There's another version of this build I was looking at that dropped 7 heatsinks and the flamers to free up room for endo so it can pick up 3 jumpjets and a TC7, but I'm mainly banking on this being a hill-humper, so it can afford to lose the JJs. That version will probably be better for the 4x cLPL fit, but I think the main version will be the go-to for ER PPCs. This is my most anticipated variant, and I think the most promising one to be the quintessential Supernova (the Hero may be more powerful, but it is more of a mini-Kodiak or plus-sized Night Gyr than anything unique).
Boiler
Endo, Ferro (65-66 per leg, max elsewhere), XL325 (62.9KPH), 2 JJs
2x Gauss (1 per arm) with 5.5 tons of ammo
2x cERPPC
16 DHS, TC1 It's not gonna be a poptart (even with 3 hoverjets, I don't think it could do it) but it's still a brutal build and is likely to be the most powerful Supernova. On the bright side, there's no real reason to run it if you can just take a Kodiak, but it also has more interesting secondary builds than the rest of the variants (dual LBX20 + SRMs, for example). And I do find it ironic that the mech with the least reason to worry about heat is named the "Boiler".
Value
It's hard to say what the best value is gonna be in this pack. The base 3 variants...I'm not sure how much fun they're gonna be. A lot of it is gonna depend on quirks. But if you do decide to buy the pack, adding the hero on should be a no-brainer because it's the best, except you can probably have a better time just playing the KDK-3, so maybe not. The reinforcement pack adds the SNV-C which I'm really looking forward to, but it's not like it's a guaranteed winner. So I think my recommendation is to wait at least until we see the quirks - you miss out on those sweet goodies, but I think quirks are going to have a bigger impact on this mech than most.
Predictions
The Hero Supernova, and maybe the SNV-C, will be pretty good mechs, and seen relatively frequently in the PUG queue. There's no OP or P2W stuff in this pack, but there's a lot of risky-looking mechs that may prove to be disappointing. Competitively speaking, it's hard to see a team taking 3 of the Boilers over 2 Kodiaks and a Night Gyr, but perhaps it could be seen as a backup mech in MRBC, or in a tonnage-based league (or CW or Group queue) if you're 10 tons short of a Kodiak. Most variants will probably settle into Tier 3, but 2 or 3 could find their way into Tier 2 or even low Tier 1.
