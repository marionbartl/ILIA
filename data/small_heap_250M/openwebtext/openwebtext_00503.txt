In an interview with Cleveland Right to Life's Molly Smith earlier this month, Mission America President Linda Harvey claimed that LGBT youth centers are in fact “homosexual sex centers” where “kids are being preyed upon by older homosexuals” and contracting HIV.
Harvey reported that LGBT teens at these centers “go and socialize with out homosexuals who are college-age and some of the volunteers who are out homosexuals” which leads her to believe that “kids are being preyed upon by older homosexuals.”
“The things that go on in the bathrooms at these centers…It's unbelievable. It's everything you can imagine” she said.
“Social service agencies donate money because, again, it's considered a youth center. No, it's a homosexual sex center and kids should not be involved in this. This is another way HIV is being spread, I think. There's no question that kids are being preyed upon by older homosexuals, and that's why you see Centers for Disease Control shows 13- to 24-year-old HIV rates are going up.”
Harvey also went after anti-bullying programs in schools, which she faulted for telling children that “people are born homosexual” and that “there's nothing you can do to stop bullying of those people when it does actually exist than accept homosexuality,” and for failing to report “the full picture” that there is in fact “no such thing as a gay person.”
“There is no such thing as a gay person,” she declared. “They are people with those attractions and preferences, but not intrinsically, and those behaviors are immoral and harmful. So, are they ever going to tell children that? I would hope so, but these bullying programs are pretty weak on the whole picture.”

Beyond Emission Pricing – a Renewables Revolution in the True Sense of the Word
Yes we can. Two years ago, scientists from Stanford University applied the mantra of President Obama's 2008 campaign to renewable energy, when they published a plan to meet the world's entire energy demand with wind, water, and sunlight by 2030 – using today's technology. Similarly, the International Panel on Climate Change's new Special Report on Renewable Energy includes scenarios, in which renewables supply 80% of the global energy consumption by 2050. The good news is: We can achieve the transition to a low-carbon renewables-based energy sector with today's technology.
The bad news is that we are far from realizing the technological potential of renewables, not to mention their environmental and economic benefits. In its 2011 Energy Outlook, the Energy Information Administration forecasts a share of less than 15% for renewables in the U.S. electricity generation mix by 2035. Compared to 2009, the share of renewables is projected to grow by a mere four percentage points, while coal and natural gas are expected to account for more than two thirds of U.S. electricity generation. This meager growth of renewables is all the more surprising, as the EIA's projections account for the present potpourri of policies promoting renewable energy at the U.S. federal, state, and regional level. So what is wrong with our current policy approach?
Technology is Ready, But Policy Lags
Policy measures in the U.S. and across the globe tend to focus on the cost-competitiveness of wind, solar, and other renewable energy technologies. Feed-in tariffs, production tax credits, and certificate trading schemes all aim to bridge the cost gap between renewable energy technologies and fossil fuel incumbents.
With its focus on generation cost, the present policy landscape tends to ignore regulatory, behavioral, and other obstacles to a timely transition to renewable energy. A closer analysis of the electricity market, for instance, reveals a whole plethora of barriers to the entry of renewable energy technologies. A look at Europe's two largest economies – France and Germany – reveals just how important these barriers are. Both countries have established promotional policies that offer similar financial incentives for electricity generation from renewables. Yet, Germany has achieved several orders of magnitude greater deployment rates than neighboring France, pointing to other forces at play than generation cost-competitiveness alone.
Policy Focus on Production Cost Ignores Other Barriers
One such force is the challenge to gain access to the grid – not exactly a plug-and-play procedure. If incoming renewables entrepreneurs want to sell their power, they need to connect their generation facilities to the electricity grid. Electricity distribution, however, is a natural monopoly. Without a strong regulatory obligation to grant grid access to incoming players, producers of electricity from renewables are left at the mercy of network operators, who themselves tend to be producers of electricity eager to eliminate competition.
Before renewable energy entrepreneurs can sell (or even generate) any electricity at all, they need to obtain the permits necessary to set up and operate their power plants. The longer the lead-time and the greater the uncertainty of the permit process, the higher the cost of capital as banks and other investors will charge a premium for their financial support. A high level of fragmentation greatly complicates and lengthens the permit process. Large-scale power plant projects, e.g., for coal or nuclear, often receive preferential treatment in the form of a single, comprehensive permit process. In contrast, small-scale power plants, such as most wind and solar projects, seldom benefit from such streamlined processes but, rather, require multiple, often duplicative permit procedures. For instance, acquiring the necessary permits for a wind power plant may involve no less than eight different U.S. government agencies – at the federal level alone.
Planning, Permits, and Protests
A key factor determining the likelihood of success of any permit application is spatial planning. Traditionally, spatial planning takes the form of zoning, reserving specific zones for industrial development, including power plants. Without adjustments, many local zoning regimes would treat your residential roof-top solar PV installation and other micro-generation plants using renewables the same as a large-scale nuclear power plant. Al Gore himself fell victim to such zoning when he first tried to put solar panels on the roof of his Belle Meade home. A national survey among local planners revealed that more than 80% of the surveyed communities did not address, much less accommodate renewable energy technologies in their zoning ordinances. The necessary modifications take time and create costly uncertainty for project developers.
Many local authorities, while generally supportive of a low-carbon economy based on renewables, are reluctant to open their communities to the siting of wind turbines and other renewables plants whose aesthetic value is disputed. This “not-in-my-backyard” movement has already gained strong support in the U.S. as evidenced by the recent opposition to wind power projects in Vermont, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and the Nantucket Sound. Local population, industry, and administration require time to learn how to deal with new technology. In the meantime, renewable energy technologies struggle to overcome issues of local acceptability.
These are just a few of the many obstacles to renewables large-scale deployment. The ongoing debate about the introduction of emission pricing at the federal level and similar state initiatives suggest that a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade regime may resolve the present policy impasse. Indeed, most economists praise emission pricing as the most efficient means of promoting abatement technologies such as renewables. Just like feed-in tariffs, tax incentives and other existing policy measures, however, emission pricing would primarily address the issue of renewables' cost-competitiveness. The aforementioned and other barriers to the large-scale deployment of renewable energy technologies would remain unresolved.
Emission Pricing – Remedy and Risk
Worse yet, emission pricing exacerbates the risk of replacing our current fossil fuel path-dependency with another. The ensuing market pull toward renewables would likely result in a run for the current least-cost renewables technologies, such as hydro and onshore wind. As the market's invisible hand grasps for the least-cost short-term solutions, it may well ignore renewables technologies that could prove more cost-efficient in the long term. The transport sector provides an instructive example of the risks involved in prematurely narrowing climate change mitigation efforts to a single technology: The recent focus on biofuels derived from corn, sugar cane, and other food crops, praised by some as the transport sector's energy panacea, resulted in a scarcity of crops driving food prices up to a level that threatened to bring famine to many developing countries.
Don't get me wrong: Emission pricing has a role to play in successful climate change mitigation and promoting renewable energy. But we must not overestimate that role or concentrate our efforts solely on one, albeit a very important policy approach. Rather, our policies need to be as diverse as the obstacles they seek to overcome. It is time we embraced this policy challenge and viewed it as an opportunity. After all, it is considerably cheaper to eliminate obstacles, e.g., by regulatory intervention, instead of compensating for them, an aspect of crucial importance in these times of budget austerity.
The necessary institutional and regulatory reforms are so far-reaching that we need a renewables revolution in the true sense of the word. The current trend toward global warming can only be turned around if the economic and legal, the engineering and scientific communities, as well as educators, marketers and the infamous citizen on Main Street join forces. Following in the tradition of the Industrial Revolution, the Renewables Revolution will have to permeate and engage virtually all sectors of society.

Laura Herrick, a contributor to the Kansas City Star 's “Midwest Voices” section, has some thoughts on how women can prevent rape. So many, many thoughts. At the risk of ruining the surprise: Every single one of them is bad.
The post has The post has been deleted since it was published on Friday (HUH), but lucky for us, a tipster sent Jezebel screen shots of the original story before it was pulled.
Buckle up for a wild journey back through time, past several waves of feminism to a place where it's the axiomatic expectation of women to quit asking to be raped by getting too drunk, to not “yell rape” when what you really meant was “oops!” and to stop hawing about equal rights if you're not actually prepared to take equal responsibility for your drunken actions (getting raped). But I'm getting ahead of myself. To the excerpts!

Herrick starts with preemptive defense, possibly at the urging of an editor who sensed a gathering storm in the distance but decided, unwisely, to ignore it.
“I empathize with women who have been raped,” she writes, adding “I would also like to remind men that ‘no means no' (and if someone is too drunk to say no, then no is implied); that no matter what a woman wears or does, she isn't ‘asking for it.”
Sponsored
She then spends the rest of the piece asserting literally exactly those things. It's almost poetic; the contradictions are so flagrant they could catch fire:
I saw a quote on Facebook that said, “When a woman drinks too much she expects to wake up the next day hung over, not raped.” I agree. But as women, shouldn't we take responsibility for our bodies by not becoming so intoxicated that we don't know what is happening? Every woman should know her drink limit and stop there. No, she's not asking to be raped by being drunk. But isn't it her responsibility to reduce the risk by not getting to that point? And if you wake up the morning after doing the ‘walk of shame' don't yell rape if you regret your actions of the night before. Accept your role in what happened, learn from the experience and move on.
Accept that as a woman, you will never be 100 percent safe around men. Don't squander your irretrievable youth fighting to be seen as something more than an object available for the taking: It causes wrinkles.
She goes on to add that if women want to be taken seriously in our quest for equality, we really should stop yawping “rape” every time we regret a lighthearted sexual caper. It makes the real rape victims—whoever they are, Herrick does not say—look bad. “Every woman who falsely accuses a man of rape makes the battle harder for women who are actually raped,” she writes, in addition to unfairly tarnishing men's reputations. And:
When men drink, their decision-making abilities are also limited. If a woman was too drunk to know what she was doing and should be excused for what happened, then why are men not allowed to be too drunk to make good decisions? And if a woman is so intoxicated that she can't remember giving consent for sex, then how can she know that she didn't give consent? If she was so drunk she was unable to make good judgments, then how can we be sure that she has any idea what actually happened?
Herrick notes specifically that she is not referring to “extreme situations” such as “the Stanford incident.” If a drunk man with “ precisely what she means, than whom the hell is she talking about? If she's not censuring Herrick notes specifically that she is not referring to “extreme situations” such as “the Stanford incident.” If a drunk man with “ limited decision making ability ” is notpreciselywhat she means, than whom the hell is she talking about? If she's not censuring his victim , who was too drunk to walk and certainly too drunk to consent, than whom, exactly, is this missive intended to reach?

“Men, stop acting like animals,” she concludes. And women?
“And women, take charge of your bodies and your sexuality by being sober enough to stop unwanted advances and sober enough to actually enjoy sex when you choose to have it.”
Stop drinking, it makes you more susceptible to rape. Stop wearing revealing clothes. Stop going outside, stop living your life, because the system ain't gonna change, baby. Herrick has chosen to use her platform—as a writer and, as her bio states, a public school teacher for 25 years—to remind women and girls that they should always be careful, always be afraid, and that no matter what, the burden of ensuring our safety will always be unduly ours to bear.
Luckily, these hoary tropes have been left in the past, relegated to the same dustbins that hold other absurd, laughable, antiquated notions. Because surely no sane, politically engaged (columnist, woman, human) in 2016 thinks those things anymore, right? Right?
...Right?
Herrick has not responded to requests for comment.
The other half are working either full- or part-time with no benefits or no job security, or in temporary, contract or casual positions, says the report by McMaster University and United Way Toronto being released Saturday.
Barely half of working adults in the GTA and Hamilton have full-time jobs with benefits and expect to be working for their current employer a year from now, according to a groundbreaking report on precarious work and household well-being.
“But it also reaches out and touches family and social life,” it says. “It can affect how people socialize and how much they are able to give back to their communities. It can cause tensions at home.”
It notes that ‘precarious' or insecure work in the region has increased by 50 per cent in the past 20 years and is impacting everything from people's decision to form relationships, have children and volunteer in their community.
Low-income workers in unstable jobs are typically employed by temporary agencies that pay minimum wage, with no benefits or security. They can also be found in the fast-food, cleaning and service sector and in manufacturing where they are often “on call,” and uncertain of their work hours or weekly schedule. Lack of job security often makes these workers reluctant to report or refuse work they consider dangerous, the report notes.
These “stressed-out” middle-income workers are often found in universities and colleges as contract lecturers and research assistants, in hospitals and government as contract nurses and office staff, and in non-profit agencies where those on the front-lines rely on time-limited grants to pay their wages.
“What we didn't expect to see was how much precarious work has crept into middle-income households,” he said. “The impact is even being felt in upper-income levels.”
“We know that precarious work arrangements are common in low-income households,” said McMaster University labour and economics professor Wayne Lewchuk .
One of the report's most startling findings is that up to half of insecure workers are living in middle-income households earning between $50,000 and $100,000, says one of the report's lead researchers.
“The findings . . . raise serious concerns regarding the potential breakdown of social structures as precarious employment becomes more of the norm in Canadian society,” the report says.
Across all income groups, the report found “clear indications” that insecure work is causing increasing household stress and limiting people's ability to participate in their communities.
Some question whether the report's definition of ‘precarious employment' is too broad. For example, the self-employed who choose to run their own businesses may not know a year from now if they will have a job. And yet they are also considered precariously employed by the study.
“But I think it is the start of a necessary conversation we need to have,” says Jamison Steeve of the University of Toronto's Martin Prosperity Institute .
Steeve, who left his position as principal secretary to former Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty last spring, is among a dozen academic, labour, business and community members who will be panellists at a Toronto symposium on the report on Monday.
“In the session on Monday . . . we're going to have a chance to look at that definition and develop policies that are going to help the most affected,” he says.
The report, which surveyed 4,000 working adults between the ages of 25 and 65 and conducted in-depth interviews with 100 of them, is part of a five-year, $1-million research project on precarious employment in Southern Ontario, funded by the federal Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.
The project's goal is to document the characteristics and prevalence of unstable employment and show how society is changing as a result. The current report looks at household well-being and community participation, while future research will try to assess the economic impact and recommend solutions.
“If we have people . . . who are not working to their full potential, then that is an economic issue,” says Steeve
“If the nature of the workforce has changed so dramatically but our laws and social structures have not, then we're not leveraging all of the economic benefits,” he adds.
United Way Toronto first sounded the alarm on precarious employment in its , 2007 report Losing Ground , which showed how the phenomenon was aggravating social problems.
“While we knew from Losing Ground there was an issue, we wanted to understand the complexity and the actual complexion of the issue,” says United Way President Susan McIsaac . “Is this episodic in people's lives, or is this a new trend in what employment looks like in the province and in particular the Toronto and Hamilton regions?”
The ongoing research will help the charity focus its community investments and advocacy for the future, she adds.
European countries have been documenting the shift to precarious work for some time, Lewchuk says.
“As far as we can tell, there is no research like this in North America, certainly not in Canada,” he says. “The idea is to build a database to track precarious employment and dig deeper into its impact here.”
Precarious employment compounds the impact of poverty, Lewchuk says. But, as the study shows, it also hurts middle-income households.
“Financial resources help to mitigate the destabilizing effects of precarious work,” he says. “But we found that in some cases, middle-income households with precarious work are under more stress than low-income households with secure employment.”
The report expands the common definition of precarious employment — typically described as seasonal, temporary or casual — to include the self-employed without employees, such as truck drivers, people offering child care in their homes or freelance editors. By that measure, about one in five Toronto and Hamilton area workers is precariously employed. When the researchers added part-time and full-time workers without benefits or job security, the rate jumped to half of the area's workers.
Non-whites and newcomers in Canada less than 20 years were more likely to be in insecure work, as were those aged 25 to 35 and over age 55.
“Regardless of a worker's personal characteristics, work sector or the region they live in, there is a reasonable chance that their employment will have many of the characteristics of precarious employment,” the report says.
Unlike poverty, which is often concentrated in certain neighbourhoods, precarious work is found in both high- and low-income regions, the report adds.
Labour law and income security programs were designed in the postwar era when precarious work was rare and employers were largely responsible for training, benefits and pensions, Lewchuk notes. The report points to the need for a new set of policies to limit the spread of unstable employment or mitigate its negative effects.
The impact of unstable work on personal and family life is profound, the report found. For example, people in low-income precarious jobs are less likely to have a close friend to talk to or to help with small jobs than those in more secure employment.
Workers in unstable jobs are less likely to have children. Men, in particular, reported they put off having a family due to insecure employment. These workers find it more difficult to find child care, help their children attend extracurricular activities and pay for school supplies and trips. At lower incomes, they are more likely to run into trouble paying for food.
Researchers also heard that income uncertainty makes it hard to commit to family or community activities.
They heard that precarious work is becoming even more unstable. For example, workers reported that it is no longer common for temporary agency work to lead to full-time jobs. And wage premiums to compensate for the lack of benefits and permanency are now rare. Most temp work pays the $10.25 hourly minimum wage.
More than 80 per cent of those in precarious employment do not receive any benefits, making them vulnerable to unexpected life circumstance such as illness, injury, or premature retirement, the report notes. Those who do get benefits often don't have family coverage.
Workers often feel powerless to complain or turn down hours or assignments for fear of losing the job or the next contract, the report says.
They are also more likely to work multiple jobs in a year and often juggle more than one at a time. It means increased transit time, more difficulties organizing child care and less family time.
Work in GTA and Hamilton
50.3 % have permanent, full-time jobs with benefits and security
18.4 % are in precarious employment, meaning their work is contract, temporary, casual
22.5 % are in full-time employment but without benefits, regular working hours, or job security beyond the next 12 months.
8.8 % are in permanent part-time work
Precarious employment has increased by 50 per cent in the past 20 years.
Temporary employment has increased in the CMA by 40 per cent since 1997
Self-employment with no employees jumped by 45 per cent between 1989 and 2007
Newcomers are more likely to be in precarious employment
Manufacturing sector workers are least likely to be in secure work
Portrait of precarious workers
Earn 46 per cent less than secure workers and report household incomes that are 34 per cent lower
Rarely get benefits
Often paid cash and more likely to not get paid at all
Often don't know schedule a week in advance. Unexpected schedule changes are common

Reluctant to raise employment rights for fear of losing job
More likely to have work monitored
Less likely to be unionized
Often required to work on-call
Often hold more than one job

Impact of precarious work
Precarious workers are more likely to:
Be single
Have a spouse who works part-time or not at all
Have no children
Say employment anxiety interferes with personal and family life, and household activities
Say uncertain work schedules interfere with doing things with family and friends
Run out of money to buy food if they are also low-income
Impact of precarious work on children of low- and middle-income households
Most likely to report problems paying for school supplies, trips and extracurricular activities
Less likely to attend school meetings or volunteer at children's activities outside school
More likely to have difficulty finding appropriate child care
Most likely to report delaying having children
New Simulation Represents 100% Renewable Energy System
November 4th, 2016 by Joshua S Hill
Researchers at the Lappeenranta University of Technology in Finland have developed the first ever model depicting a 100% global renewable energy system.
In a first of its kind-type simulation researchers from the Lappeenranta University of Technology in Finland have modeled a 100% global renewable energy system covering the entire planet, structured into 145 separate regions as part of 9 major world regions. The global Internet of Energy Model puts into effect the targets set by the Paris Agreement using only renewable energy generating sources. Specifically, the model is intended to find the most economical solution for a renewable electricity system, and show how renewable energy can provide electricity for every season, day, and hour of the year.
“With the simulation, anyone can explore what a renewable electricity system would look like,” said Christian Breyer, LUT Solar Economy Professor and a leading scientist behind the model. “This is the first time scientists have been able to do this on a global scale.”
The model is able to provide the best mix of renewable energy generation, energy storage, and transmission components to cover electricity demand, resulting in a total electricity cost resting approximately between €55 and €70 per MWh for all 9 major regions.
But the developers of the model aren't going to leave it at that, they are hoping to be able to expand the model so that it is eventually able to model the full energy sector, including heat and transport. The developers also hope to model the transition from the current energy systems towards a fully sustainable, low-carbon system.
“My hope is that we can finally stop debating about these myths,” explained Pasi Vainikka, Principal Scientist from VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd. “The visualisation shows exactly how a fully renewable electricity system operates. So let's just build it.”
ON one end of the phone is an officer trained to take difficult phone calls and send help. On the other end is a 10-year-old boy who accidentally shot and killed his sister.
The little boy knows, in that moment, that his life has changed forever.
The audio makes for difficult listening.
“My sister is choking,” Sean Smith says, stifling back tears and clearly panicked.
“She's dead,” he says.
“She's dead?” the 911 dispatcher asks the boy.
“Yes, please get my mum and dad. Oh my God!” he screams back in a high-pitched voice years away from puberty and too young to be experiencing such horror.
Moments earlier, Sean had been looking for his Nintendo games in the top drawer of his father's bedside table. Instead he found a gun, pointed it at the window and pretended to fire.
Only the gun was loaded, and when the bullet cleared the chamber, Sean's sister, 8, ran in front of the weapon.
The bullet went through her shoulder and into her heart. She died in his arms, despite his best efforts to stop the bleeding and keep his only sibling alive.
“I didn't know my dad's gun was loaded and I shot her. I didn't mean to,” Sean told police.
Erin Smith's death was 26 years ago, but it feels like yesterday to Sean who still lives with the guilt and last week talked about it publicly for the first time.
The family's story is a timely reminder for Americans who continue to kill each other with firearms.
There are around 110 fatal shootings involving children under 14 each year in the US.
It's a timely reminder for Australia, too, where a handful of politicians are lobbying for more guns, a 15-year-old boy was shot and killed in an attack on a Sydney police station and a 12-year-old boy was named our youngest ever terror suspect.
‘I DIDN'T MEAN TO SHOOT HER'
Mr Smith told CNN he was just “waving it around” when he shot and killed his baby sister.
“I aimed it out of the window and as I pulled the trigger she was running out of the room. Unfortunately, it did strike her in the shoulder,” he said.
“I immediately ran, got the phone, called 911. I picked her up, held her in my lap and unfortunately she passed away. I never got to see her in the hospital so the last image I have of her is in my lap.”
He said he was haunted by the shooting and asked by friends at school: “What was it like to kill your sister?”
Her death became a barrier between him and his parents who for years struggled to talk about it. Sean blamed himself and his father blamed himself. Sean's life spiralled out of control. There were hard drugs, theft and prison time before straightening out and starting a family of his own.
He knows what a weapon in the wrong hands can do and spends his time warning others about guns in the family home.
Five Things the Gun Industry Won't Tell You 2:40 From Main Street to Washington, gun control is likely to continue being a controversial issue. Here's a look at five things you may not know about the gun industry. Photo: Shutterstock.com/Burlingham
A weapon found its way into the wrong hands at Parramatta at the beginning of this month and the consequences there were tragic.
Police accountant Curtis Cheng was shot and killed before police returned fire, killing the 15-year-old gunman.
It's a bad time for independent MP Bob Katter and Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie to be calling for more guns but that's exactly what they're doing. In particular, they want to see a rapid-fire shotgun capable of firing eight shots in eight seconds allowed in Australia.
“To expand gun ownership? I think that's a great thing,” Senator McKenzie told news.com.au
Ms McKenzie, who grew up around guns and took journalists clay shooting last week, makes no apologies for her pro-gun stance.
She says children are at risk from “a lot of things in society” and putting guns in their hands and teaching them to shoot is the safest thing we could possibly do.
She rejects the idea that more guns equals more danger, but she knows it's not a popular opinion.
‘IT'S BECOME TABOO TO TALK ABOUT GUNS'
Ms McKenzie admits there's a real problem with guns in this country, but it's not hunters or sporting shooters who are responsible.
She says the teen who opened fire on Curtis Cheng was armed with an illegal firearm and there's very little that can be done to keep them out of the country.
“When we think about organised crime, about bikie gangs, there's a real issue with illegal firearms. These aren't guns owned by the guy at the rifle range, these are guns brought in through ports and bought on the black market.”
She says she “can't believe the attitude towards guns in this country” and wishes they weren't such a taboo subject.
“It's almost become taboo to talk about guns, to be upfront.”
She says instead of rejecting guns outright, Australian parents should be arming themselves and teaching their children to shoot safely.
“Learning how to shoot, learning how to hunt, is hugely important. It's been a strong family pastime for hundreds of thousands of Australian families. All of the law abiding firearm owners I know who have children are very careful with how they've raised children around guns.”
Australia has a National Firearms Agreement which outlines which weapons can be owned and how they must be stored. Ms McKenzie said the safeguards are what separates Australia from the US and prevents shootings like Mr Smith's in 1989.
“I think when we think of issues with guns, we think of the US. We have a different cultural heritage and history.”
The Nationals senator defended her call to see the Adler 110 returned to Australia. She said there was a “misunderstanding about its lethality” but others disagree.
Walter Mikac, whose wife Nanette, 36, and daughters Alannah, six, and Madeline were killed in the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, said last week he was worried about the watering down of Australia's tough gun laws.
“We're not in a country where you need semiautomatic firearms; we're not in a country where you need to be able to fire eight shots at a time to protect yourself,” he said.
“I think we want to be individual in that we can live as a peaceful nation, not as a nation where everyone's in fear of someone else having a firearm.”
A FAMILY TORN APART
Sean Smith, who bravely told his story this week, knows how easily things can go wrong. His parents had the best intentions when they armed themselves and, up until the night before the shooting, kept the .38 revolver out of reach.
Larry, Sean's father, was given the gun by his father a few weeks before the June 5, 1989 shooting.
He had it stored safely in the closet but took it out the night before the shooting when he spotted someone trying to climb over his fence. He absent-mindedly stored it in his top drawer. It was still loaded. Fate and a 10-year-old boy's wayward curiosity did the rest.
He says he's forgiven himself but will never forget.
“I know I've forgiven myself, and I'm pretty sure Erin's forgiven me. It was about 20 years later when I finally could truly and honestly forgive myself. It was an accident. It was an accident.”
Palawan is the westernmost province of the Philippines , the one with the largest land area and with probably the most pristine natural environment away from its settlements.
Location
The island of Palawan stretches from close to Mindoro in the northeast almost to Borneo in the southwest. It lies between the South China Sea to the northwest and Sulu Sea to the southeast.
Metropolitan Filipinos tend to regard Palawan as their final, unspoilt frontier, but even here venal politicians conspire to degrade conservation lands and there are plans for virgin forest to be logged out so lucrative oil palms can be planted. Get here while the beaches are still relatively deserted and unspoiled; resorts are still relatively few and far between in most of Palawan.
The indigenous flora and fauna of Palawan are somewhat different from the rest of the country. Biologists draw the Wallace-Huxley line to classify ecological regions in the area; Palawan is west of the line, grouped with Borneo, while most of the Philippines is east of the line.
The Samal people, also known as Bajau, Badjao or several other spellings, and as Sea Gypsies, live on Palawan, as well as the Sulu Islands, mainland Mindanao and parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. They are renowned for their skill at diving for pearls; some of them get down more than 30 m (100 feet) without breathing equipment.
The Magellan expedition visited Palawan in the 1520s, and hired pilots there to help them navigate the rest of their journey to the Spice Islands.
The Philippine government considers Palawan part of the Mimaropa group of provinces, hence falling under Luzon at the next level of the hierarchy. An executive order to reclassify it as part of the Western Visayas region was issued in 2005, but has not been implemented as of 2015.
For Wikivoyage purposes, we treat Palawan as a separate fourth region of the country, the other three being Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.

Embed Woman at Trump Rally Says TSA Workers Shouldn't Wear 'Heebeejabees' 1:13 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog
MANCHESTER, N.H. — Donald Trump faced a number of wild questions at a town hall here Thursday, including one from a woman who suggested he replace “heebeejabees” working as TSA officers with veterans.
The woman suggested Trump address the jobs shortage for veterans by employing them at the border or with TSA, asking him to “get rid of all these ‘heebeejabies' they wear at TSA," presumably a reference to workers who wear the Muslim headscarf called a “hijab."
Trump simply replied: “We're looking at that. We're looking into a lot of things.”
It's unclear what exactly he meant he was looking into.
The comments come as Trump and his aides have carefully, and oftentimes confusingly, been walking back his proposal to ban Muslim immigrants from the U.S. — a policy that, when he introduced it during the GOP primary, caused an uproar among members of both parties, with critics calling it unconstitutional and at worst, racist. Trump has now said he doesn't want to ban all Muslim immigrants, only those from “terror countries,” though he has yet to explain his criteria for evaluating immigrants.
It was one of a handful of potentially damaging moments during the presumptive GOP nominee's town hall event in New Hampshire — and the latest indication that, though Trump has made an effort to rein in his style and tone and focus more on policy in recent weeks, he's still far from the disciplined candidate Republicans have hoped for and Trump's aides have promised.
The unusual forum, where the audience was able to ask unvetted questions, gave Trump reason to boast — “Do you think Hillary Clinton would ever do a news conference like this? Totally unvetted?” he asked — but it also left some room for error.
“ That could be a Mexican plane up there, they're getting ready to attack”
When a questioner told Trump he opposed abortion, the candidate briefly replied, “we're with you,” before moving on, calling the questioner's comments “tough questions.” Trump has a notoriously spotty record on abortion; he's previously described himself as pro-abortion rights and now says he opposes it.
The man then advocated that the U.S. stop supporting “zionist Israel,” a suggestion unpopular amongst the Republican base that heavily heavily favors unflinching support for the country.
“Let me just tell you that Israel is a very very important ally,” Trump responded.
At one point, when a questioner suggested Trump should try to encourage a “culture” in which Americans want to buy products made in the U.S., Trump agreed: “Our people should have more pride in buying made in the USA … we should put that on our products.” He declined to mention that many of his own Trump-branded products are made abroad.
He gave the audience a taste of the more disciplined Trump during the first half of the event, where he largely repeated much of the themes and proposals he outlined during his Tuesday speech on trade policy.
The candidate spoke largely extemporaneously, but occasionally referred to his notes for facts and figures about job losses in the area. And it still seemed at times he hadn't yet mastered his own policy — Trump read through the seven points of his trade policy near-verbatim, at times sounding like he were reading instructions for a recipe.

But even while relying on notes and well-trodden policy proposals, Trump backed himself into a gaffe the moment he strayed from the script, joking of a plane overhead: “That could be a Mexican plane up there, they're getting ready to attack.” The comment blew up on Twitter, with many critics musing over the possibility of a President Trump someday making similar jokes behind the podium.
And some of his comments underscored major questions hanging over his policy proposals. “We're going to keep everybody here. They're not going to leave,” Trump said of the possibility of companies moving overseas in response to his trade policies. He later said, in response to a question on “corporate backlash” to his policies, that jobs might exit certain states but they wouldn't go to Mexico, without offering an explanation for why.
The space stations went first. Size and location in orbit did not matter.
The ISS, Tiangong, Genesis I and II, military and spy satellites, communications, weather, navigation, everything. Even the thousands of pieces of decommissioned satellites and junk and space debris left by 50 years of spaceflight. Everything.
Then every radio telescope on the planet just vanished. Then every rocket capable of escape velocity, and all nuclear warheads. And before anyone knew Earth was under attack, it was over. Technologically, mankind was suddenly back to square one of the space age. And on top of that, communications were gone. GPS was gone. SDI was gone. Even all that crap the Apollo missions left on the Moon, as we later found out - was gone.
And then [[the fleet]] was gone, too. But they [[left something]] behind.
People started tattooing The Message onto their bodies, naming their children, pets, [[a public holiday|message day]] and even whole cities after it. Soon The Message was used as a universal greeting phrase. Or, depending on context and culture, to declare love, or hate to one another.
It turned out that people didn't care about what it meant, they just invented their own meanings, used it in bedtime stories, wrote fiction and made movies and video games about it. In fact, we still don't know for sure. There are still archaeologists debating about its purpose.
And [[why they chose the Moon for it|why moon]].
//New Horizons//
On January 19th 2006, they strapped //"a grand piano glued to a cocktail bar-sized satellite dish."// to the fastest rocket ever launched and it went well.
<html><img src="rocket.jpg" /></html>
Though not as fast as //Helios// and never as distant as //Voyager 1//, this 1,000 lb robot was going to be the first man-made spacecraft to do a relatively close flyby of various trans-Neptunian objects, most famously of course ex-planet Pluto and its moon Charon.
[[So far, its mission was a huge success|probe2]].
On October 27, 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, Vasili Arkhipov, a Soviet naval officer prevented the launch of a nuclear torpedo and a possible nuclear war.
We came closer than we knew at the time.
On September 26, 1983, Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov of the Soviet Air Defence Forces was on duty at the command center of the Oko nuclear early-warning system when the system reported a missile being launched from the United States. He judged that the report was a false alarm and prevented a retaliatory nuclear attack, which would've resulted in World War III.
He received no reward.
On January 25, 1995, a team of Norwegian and American scientists launched a research rocket to study the aurora borealis over Svalbard. Due to its resemblance to a submarine-launched Trident missile, Russian forces were put on high alert, Boris Yeltsin was notified immediately and the "nuclear briefcase" used to authorize nuclear launch was automatically activated.
The incident was reported in the news a week afterward.
On July 14, 2015, everything and nothing happened. Nothing could've prepared humanity [[for this|butts]].

The 14th of July became known as //Message Day//, a global holiday to remember all the lives lost by crashed cars and airplanes and [[ships lost at sea|ships]]. People stuck in elevators. All effectively lost man-hours in human spaceflight. All our little robots we sent out there, never to return. Frightened military leaders with access to Big Red Buttons, who [[snapped|redbuttons]] at the sight of The Message, killing hundreds. The money lost at the completely crashed markets. Lost jobs. Lives ended by suicide.
They thought the world was going to end. It didn't. But overnight everyone knew: We are not alone. At last, a common enemy. Something to work together for. On that day, mankind lost every reason to fight each other. Message Day is a day of unity.
Though, in the end, it saved everyone, nothing could have prepared humanity for [[The Message|butts]].
At first, every nation denied having anything to do with that fateful capsule we found. As soon as its contents were revealed though, everyone claimed responsibility.
Just one blurry image, yet clear enough to make out what was happening. A giant array of dark objects, in orbit. The photograph mechanism must've been triggered by a collision, which in turn threw the canister far enough to have been spared by what we call now //the orbital purge// of our messengers.
Of all our devices, cameras, cell phones, space telescopes, imaging technology. Out of everything, it was that ancient satellite providing us with a record of what happened that day. Some //evidence//.
[[Besides The Message|left something]].
Too many years the guys at NASA had to work with those awfully blurry images Hubble gave us. New Horizons would've given them all the sensory data and high-resolution pictures they could hope for. Given the bandwith limitations of their Deep Space Network it would've taken them months and months to send all that information back to earth, but the nuclear battery on board didn't care.
We now think of it as our accidental first contact. [[It did not end well|gone]].

With most sonar and radar technonoly dying on us,
we received little more than a few garbled remains of cries for help, descriptions of earthquakes and shifts in the crust.
Only a fraction of those who where out in the open made it back to the mainland, stricken with panic and terror, eyes wide open, muttering about the horror they had to witness at sea.
Most of these poor souls never returned at all.
[[Back|message day]]
The immediate question was obvious: Why write something on the surface of a moon? The pre-message humanity didn't know or care, but today many kids know this stuff by the time they enter elementary school.
* Because our Moon is tidally locked. That means that the same side will always face the Earth. Face us, the recipients.
* It is the brightest object in the night sky.
* That giant rock is, in comparison to mankind, incredibly old. About 4,3 billion years, that's almost as old as the Earth itself.
* We will probably never be able to remove The Message. And even if we could, we probably wouldn't, as it would just be a giant waste of recources and anger the many Message Cults, or even [[our mysterious messengers|messengers]].
The Message
//IF-50//
An ancient decommisioned and malfunctioning reconnaissance satellite noone even knew existed anymore. You know, one of those microfilm space telescopes pointed towards earth which supposedly could take pictures of your license plate, or read your newspaper. In fact, that thing was probably one of the first generation of spy satellites, or at least a relatively primitive one. However, this type took photographs and ejected their film inside canisters which would then [[descend towards earth|if-so2]].

[[Back to the beginning|Begin]]
A mind-boggingly vast fleet of unidentified craft, in dense enough formation to - for a moment - block out the sun, the moon, the stars.
It almost looked like one of those very high and thick clouds overshadowing the sky, though very quick and only for a moment.
The irony that, of all our crap out there only one then-secret spy satellite which would from that point on be known as [[IF-5O|if-so]] managed to capture a single blurry image, looking down on earth shrouded by billions of UFOs, is almost depressing. Remember those "I want to believe" crackpots? [[Who would've thought they were actually right?|crackpots]]
//"I want to believe."
"Elvis isn't dead, he just went home!"
"I was abducted and anally probed by green men from mars!"
"Global warming is a hoax!"

Pluto is about four light-hours away from earth. 4 hours after New Horizons reached Pluto, //they// arrived. The messengers.
How could they possibly travel that distance? Does that mean they are capable of faster-than-light travel, and if so, why are they even in our solar system? Why kill our space tech? Why leave a message?
Why [[us|message day]]?
A message. ''The Message''. A message to every living thing on our //Pale Blue Dot// to see in the sky, forever. Although it was, strangely enough, written in English, nobody really knew what to make of it. Some thought it was a warning, others said it was a declaration of war. Of course, the internet almost instantly went crazy over it, generating endless discussions about hidden meanings, trying to decrypt whatever could be hidden in that simple word.
There were probably more theories about its meaning than there were Moon Conspiracy crackpots back in the 20th century. Religions were formed around The Message. T-Shirts were printed. Bumper stickers too. [[People love this stuff|people]].

Davey D is a legendary, pioneering hip-hop journalist and the founder of Davey D's Hip Hop Corner. He has also lived in Oakland, California, for decades, chronicling the volatile social movements throughout the region. Here I interviewed him about why many in the Bay Area are greeting the arrival of the Super Bowl not with parties but protest. Ad Policy
Dave Zirin: How would you describe the mood in the Bay Area about the Super Bowl? What are you seeing?
Davey D: There's a lot of anger and a lot of concern over two main things. First, the Super Bowl is coming at a time when massive amounts of people have been displaced. So, it's added insult to injury to see this pageantry, all this money being spent, record amounts of police, elected officials falling all over themselves, while you have folks who gave this region its soul and its heart who can't afford to live here anymore. Downtown Oakland used to be a place that a lot of people didn't go to, then there were folks who are artists who said, “We'll make this space our home.” So you moved into a lot of those rundown buildings, fixed them up, made it a destination place, and now they've been replaced. You go to some of these places downtown and you'll see a hamburger selling for $15 dollars!
The second thing that's going on are all the police killings that have been taking place. The most egregious is the killing of Mario Woods, which happened in early December over in the Hunter's Point area. Here's a guy who was walking away from the police, he was surrounded by about 12 police officers who claim they felt their life was threatened. They shot him down in a hail of bullets. That comes on the heels of a number of killings. The other notable one was the killing of Alex Nieto which happened a year before. A security guard, who was on his way to work, had a Taser to his side, was in his neighborhood, Bernal Heights, and was eating a burrito. I believe it's been reported that somebody saw him, didn't recognize him, so we assume that's a gentrifier, who called the police and said, “There's an armed man.” They showed up, and—from a distance of 75 to 100 feet or yards away—shot him. Then of course the texting scandal which followed the Alex Nieto thing, which is that officers were caught sending racist and homophobic text messages, both on and off duty. There was a promise that they would be fired. That hasn't happened.
Why protest the Super Bowl in connection with these issues?
I'm sure people would say, “Why don't you petition your government officials, elect people to office, or follow a prescribed path to address your grievances?” And that has happened. People put Kamala Harris into office and Kamala Harris has disappeared. Diane Feinstein said she would do something. And she has disappeared. Ed Lee, the mayor, people were told he has a civil-rights background and he wouldn't let these things happen on his watch. And he's disappeared. And the list goes on and on. And when I say they disappeared, I mean they've very clearly chosen a side. They've chosen the side of the developers, they've chosen the side of the techno-archy, and they've chosen the side of the police unions. Even though their main support came from people in these respective communities being victimized. People have been going to City Hall and done everything that you're supposed to do and that's been ignored. So when that happens, you have to start hitting people where it hurts. You've got to let them know that this will not be business as usual. You will understand when you come to the Bay Area that your consciousness will be pierced, that this is not the tourist spot that's all hunky dory, and that's playing out.
The other thing is that, people are very aware that 95 percent of the people who are playing in the Super Bowl are people in the peer groups of the folks who have been demonstrating. They are black and brown men. They are black, Latino, Samoan, Tongan, Pacific Islanders. All that. So many of them know what it's like to be profiled. So many of these football players themselves know that if they're not recognized, they could easily be rounded up and smashed on just as quickly as their fans who come from those same communities. Just look at the racial hostility that's been directed toward Cam Newton.
What about police militarization? What are you seeing? LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS
If you went over to Super Bowl City the other day, you would've seen the militarization in full swing, as they were literally escorting elders in the community who were protesting and letting people know and preventing them from walking from one place to another, which they have a legal right to do because they were on the sidewalk. But they were not allowed into Super Bowl City, which is free and open to the public. And these are San Francisco residents.
At the same time that this is happening, you have folks from out of town like a guy I saw from Arkansas who wanted to take a picture with the police loaded up with AR-15s and all sorts of weaponry. So you know it's a very strange reality to see that San Franciscans are being prevented from going inside Super Bowl City, are being profiled and harassed, while out-of-towners are taking selfies with police who are militarized. That's what's going on now in this area.
Describe what a militarized cop in Super Bowl week looks like.
First you're talking about snipers on the roof of all of the buildings. You also have a very large police presence, so that if you show up in a group, you might have a hundred cops that will line up, from wall to wall, and follow you along the sidewalk. So it's like a moving barricade. Then you have folks with these enormous automatic assault rifles, all types of gear: helmets, shades, army fatigues, you know something out of a Star Wars movie. And you see them every 20 to 30 feet. And it's interesting, because if you talk to people from the hood, who have been on the receiving end of the drug wars, they're like, “Ugh, it looks like East Oakland,” because they see that all the time. That militarization shows up in their community far too often.
Is it fair to say that San Francisco is starting to feel like an elite place that's for some and not for others?
It's not starting to feel that way. For the last several years, you'd feel very unwelcome. It's not the same city. You look around, you don't see people that you recognize, the flavor's gone, old businesses have been moved out. And you have a new type of person that comes there that is very hostile to what was. They don't understand the multiculturalism, they don't understand the artistic community, they don't understand the politics. Those in the tech world, who have always wanted a whiter, and more affluent, San Francisco, are seeing their dreams come true. And a lot of that falls on the feet of people like Ed Lee, who have pretty much sold the city out.
Would you describe Bay Area residents as “unwilling hosts”?
There are a lot of people that are football fans. There are a lot of people that are happy to see the NFL Experience and Super Bowl City. So I don't want to make it seem like everybody is like that. But there's a sizable population of people that are looking at these contradictions and see that even if they go to Super Bowl City, 99 percent of them will not be going to the Super Bowl because they can't afford the tickets, even if it's in their backyard. They won't be going to the numerous parties that require you to have some sort of Super Bowl credential to see your favorite artists who are now all up in here. You know, many of the DJs aren't even working. Everyone's been flown in. But I think it's been a situation where you have two or three parallel worlds existing at once. So you have an elite that are like drinking champagne and eating caviar like a scene out of Hunger Games, standing right alongside people who have been smashed on economically and socially, who are sitting there trying to make sense out of what has just hit them.
Final thoughts? What do they not know about the Bay that you want them to know?
Oh yes. Fiftieth anniversary of the Black Panthers is this year, in the Bay Area. It's also Super Bowl 50. Cam Newton, who plays for the Panthers, whose colors are the same as the Black Panthers. So there's that. And as a die-hard Raider fan, I will tip my hat to the Denver Broncos and thank them profusely for sending Tom Brady home. But with that being said, there will be no celebrating, no toasting; no dancing in the streets and no support whatsoever for the Denver Broncos. That is the Raider Nation in me speaking forthrightly and emphatically. We will put our weight behind Cam Newton as he will bring in the 50th anniversary and celebration of the Black Panthers by winning and symbolize what this year will unfold. So, what do they need to know? This is Raider Nation, still. So, tuck your jerseys in, turn 'em inside out, and respect the soil on which you walk. That's what people from these other places need to know.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's grandly restrained response to the sanctions and expulsions US President Barack Obama announced yesterday was even by his standards both very surprising and extremely clever.
The full statement published on his website shows why:
We regard the recent unfriendly steps taken by the outgoing US administration as provocative and aimed at further weakening the Russia-US relationship. This runs contrary to the fundamental interests of both the Russian and American people. Considering the global security responsibilities of Russia and the United States, this is also damaging to international relations as a whole. As it proceeds from international practice, Russia has reasons to respond in kind. Although we have the right to retaliate, we will not resort to irresponsible ‘kitchen' diplomacy but will plan our further steps to restore Russian-US relations based on the policies of the Trump Administration. The diplomats who are returning to Russia will spend the New Year's holidays with their families and friends. We will not create any problems for US diplomats. We will not expel anyone. We will not prevent their families and children from using their traditional leisure sites during the New Year's holidays. Moreover, I invite all children of US diplomats accredited in Russia to the New Year and Christmas children's parties in the Kremlin. It is regrettable that the Obama Administration is ending its term in this manner. Nevertheless, I offer my New Year greetings to President Obama and his family. My season's greetings also to President-elect Donald Trump and the American people. I wish all of you happiness and prosperity.
(bold italics added)
Obama's mean minded and spiteful act of yesterday has afforded Putin the perfect opportunity to appear broadminded and magnanimous, and he has seized it with both hands.
Where Obama has acted in the run up to the New Year holiday to make life as difficult for Russian diplomats in the US as possible (recent reports say they are struggling to find commercial flights to comply with Obama's demand that they leave the US within 72 hours), Putin has invited the children of US diplomats in Moscow to go to the New Year and Orthodox Christmas parties in the Kremlin (it will be interesting to see whether their parents and the State Department let any of them go).
Where Obama has made angry and so far unsubstantiated claims that Putin was behind the Clinton leaks, Putin sends Obama and his family New Year greetings.
Putin then caps these grand gestures by reminding Obama – ever so gently – that in three weeks he'll be gone. Thus the reference to the incoming Trump administration and the Season's Greetings to Donald Trump. Twisting the knife even further (one can almost see the gleam in Putin's eye) the statement ends with Season's Greetings to the American people, where recent opinion polls show Putin is becoming increasingly popular with Republican voters.
In responding in this way, Putin is of course refusing to rise to Obama's bait and be provoked into a reaction that will help Obama's campaign to box in the incoming Trump administration. Indeed his statement says as much:
We regard the recent unfriendly steps taken by the outgoing US administration as provocative and aimed at further weakening the Russia-US relationship…..Although we have the right to retaliate, we will not resort to irresponsible ‘kitchen' diplomacy but will plan our further steps to restore Russian-US relations based on the policies of the Trump Administration
(bold italics added)
However its careful wording shows that Putin has also carefully judged the public reaction. He must know – and his media advisers will have told him – that this was one statement of his which the Western media would not be able to suppress or ignore, but which if only for a few hours would dominate the news cycle.
He has seized the opportunity this has afforded him to show himself and Russia in the best possible light: refusing to be provoked, solicitous for people's enjoyment of their New Year holidays, and generous towards their children.
The contrast with the way in which the Obama administration and the Western media have repeatedly sought to cast him could not be greater.
This episode also shows something else about Putin, which I have often commented on, but which receives no attention in the Western media because it so completely contradicts the image the Western media has of him. This is Putin's deeply ingrained habit of courtesy. Here we have an example of Putin using it to his and Russia's advantage.
That Putin's statement has successfully hit home is shown by the bewildered Western media reaction, which whilst reporting the statement is struggling to come up with a coherent response. In one or two places even a note of unacknowledged and heavily qualified admiration grudgingly sneaks through, as for example in this comment by the BBC's Jonathan Marcus
“This was a carefully stage-managed response from Mr Putin – dangling the possibility of tit-for-tat expulsions and then showing magnanimity in postponing any response – at least for now. It is fundamentally a put-down for the Obama administration, suggesting that, in Moscow's view, it is such a lame-duck, so irrelevant, as to make any response unnecessary. It also poses an immediate test for President-elect Trump. Will he be convinced by the evidence the US intelligence agencies say they have? And, if so, what course will he steer in his relations with Russia? This is no new Cold War. Russia is simply a kind of “pocket” superpower, nothing like the Soviet Union of old. But Mr Putin has shown here in relations with the West, as in Ukraine and Syria, that he can play a limited hand with great skill. Mr Trump will need to respond to this challenge in a decisive but graduated way.”
(bold italics added)
Though this comment is full of the West's typical condescension towards Putin and Russia (“Russia a “pocket” superpower”) – which is incidentally contradicted by its call to Trump to “respond to this challenge in a decisive but graduated way” – it cannot in the end deny the “great skill” with which Putin has acted.
Putin's statement is not of course only or even principally directed at the Western public. A fact which Western commentators consistently overlook is that Putin's primary audience, and the one he always principally addresses whenever he speaks, is the Russian public.
Here again Putin's statement shows what a skilful politician he is, which in turn shows why he has dominated Russian political life for so long.
His response to Obama's boorish actions on the eve of the New Year holiday (the biggest and most important holiday in Russia) is to call them a “provocation” . He then makes Russia – and by extension himself – appear all the stronger and greater by refusing to be provoked by them.
At the same time he makes Obama appear vindictive by revealing how his actions have disrupted the New Year holidays of Russian diplomats and their families. He then contrasts this by making Russia – and again by extension himself – appear open hearted and generous by not only refusing to respond in kind but by inviting the children of US diplomats to the New Year and Christmas parties in the Kremlin.
This is a very skilfully judged response, which will only only serve to confirm the already high opinion most Russians have of Putin, and which will further consolidate their support for him as their leader.
This incidentally has been the consistent pattern throughout Putin's Presidency, with Putin always turning the West's attacks on him to his domestic political advantage.
All in all, if this episode shows Obama at his most ugly and small-minded, it also shows Putin at his most skilful and most clever.
Since a consistent feature of Obama as President is that he always wants to be taken for the cleverest man around, Putin's reaction – showing Putin once again to be cleverer than he is – is all but guaranteed to enrage Obama even more.

The number of people interested in buying a house in April fell to its lowest level for nearly eight years, according to surveyors across the UK.
Those who saw a drop in enquiries last month outnumbered those who saw a rise by 22%.
That is the highest figure reported by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) since August 2008.
Rics said the main reason was the stamp duty rise on 1 April, and the uncertainty around the EU referendum.
The number of new enquiries fell most dramatically in London, but also fell in nine other regions of the UK.
Enquiries rose only in East Anglia, the North and Scotland.
Most surveyors also reported a fall in new instructions to sell, and most expect prices to rise over the next three months.
Rics chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said the market was characterised by uncertainty.
"More ominous is the expectation that both prices and rents will head materially higher over the medium term," he said.
Earlier this week the Halifax reported that annual house price inflation fell from 10.1% in March to 9.2% in April.
Like the proverbial internet pony of lore, you may want the OnePlus One smartphone's highly desirable specs and cheap $300 price, but you can't have it -- yet.

Sure enough, all the bits are there: 3GB of Samsung-based RAM, 5.5-inch 1080p screen, Snapdragon 801 CPU and a goodly 3,100mAH battery, all inside an 8.9mm thick body. That's pretty slim for a phablet, and therein lies the problem: squeezing all that in required a hard-to-budge (and pricey to replace) fused screen, hidden connectors and adhesives. All that adds up to a repairability score of five out of ten -- far from the worst we've seen, but if you ever manage to nab one, you may want to insure it.
AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian artillery pounded rebel-held areas of Homs as President Bashar al-Assad's government announced that voters had overwhelmingly approved a new constitution in a referendum derided as a sham by his critics at home and abroad.
The outside world has proved powerless to halt the killing in Syria, where repression of initially peaceful protests has spawned an armed insurrection by army deserters and others.
The Syrian Arab Red Crescent did manage to enter the besieged Baba Amro district of Homs and evacuate three people on Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said. Foreign reporters trapped in the area were not evacuated and the bodies of two journalists killed there had not been recovered, it said.
While foreign powers argued over whether to arm the rebels, the Syrian Interior Ministry on Monday said the reformed constitution, which could keep Assad in power until 2028, had received 89.4 percent approval from more than 8 million voters.
Syrian dissidents and Western leaders dismissed as a farce Sunday's vote, conducted in the midst of the country's bloodiest turmoil in decades, although Assad says the new constitution will lead to multi-party elections within three months.
Officials put national voter turnout at close to 60 percent, but diplomats who toured polling stations in Damascus saw only a handful of voters at each location. On the same day, at least 59 people were killed in violence around the country.
Assad says he is fighting foreign-backed “armed terrorist groups” and his main allies - Russia, China and Iran - fiercely oppose any outside intervention intended to add him to the list of Arab autocrats unseated by popular revolts in the past year.
But Qatar joined Saudi Arabia in advocating arming the Syrian rebels, given that Russia and China have twice used their vetoes to block any action by the U.N. Security Council.
“I think we should do whatever is necessary to help them, including giving them weapons to defend themselves,” Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani said in Oslo.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe criticised the U.N. Security Council's “impotence” on Syria, shown by the Russian and Chinese vetoes, and accused the Syrian authorities of “massacres” and “odious crimes.”
In a speech to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, Juppe said the time was ripe for referring Syria to the International Criminal Court and warned Assad he would be brought to justice.
“The day will come when the Syrian civilian and military authorities, first among them President Assad himself, must respond before justice for their acts. In the face of such crimes, there can be no impunity,” Juppe told the 47-member Geneva forum, which will hold an emergency debate on Syria on Tuesday.
HOMS BOMBARDED AGAIN
Shells and rockets crashed into Sunni Muslim districts of Homs that have already endured weeks of bombardment as Assad's forces, led by officers from his minority Alawite sect, try to stamp out an almost year-long revolt against his 11-year rule.
The ICRC has been pursuing talks with the Syrian authorities and opposition forces for days to secure access to besieged neighborhoods such as Baba Amro, where local activists say hundreds of wounded need treatment and thousands of civilians are short of water, food and medical supplies.
ICRC spokesman Hicham Hassan said a team from the Syrian Arab Red Crescent team had entered Baba Amro. “They have been able to evacuate three persons, including an aged woman, and a pregnant woman and her husband,” he said.
The trio were believed to be Syrian and did not include four Western journalists trapped in Baba Amro, two of them wounded. A U.S. reporter and a French photographer were killed there on February 22.
International consternation has grown over the turmoil in Syria, but there is little appetite in the West for military action akin to the U.N.-backed NATO campaign in Libya.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Western powers hoped diplomacy could change minds: “We are putting pressure on the Russians first and the Chinese afterwards so that they lift their veto.”
The European Union agreed more sanctions, targeting Syria's central bank and several cabinet ministers, curbing gold trading with state entities and banning cargo flights from the country.
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin reiterated Moscow's opposition to any military intervention in Syria.
“I very much hope the United States and other countries ... do not try to set a military scenario in motion in Syria without sanction from the U.N. Security Council,” said Putin.
The new constitution drops a clause making Assad's Baath party the leader of state and society, allows political pluralism and limits a president to two seven-year terms.
But this restriction is not retrospective, implying that Assad, 46 and already in power since 2000, could serve two further terms after his current one expires in 2014.

The opposition dismisses the reforms on offer, saying that Assad, and his father who ruled for 30 years before him, have long paid only lip service to existing legal obligations.
Former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, now the new U.N.-Arab League envoy on Syria, was holding separate talks in Geneva with Juppe and Iran's foreign minister Ali Akbar Salehi on the sidelines of a U.N. Human Rights Council meeting.
Iran is Assad's closest ally. The main Shi'ite Muslim power, it has religious ties to Assad's Alawites and is confronting the Sunnis who dominate the Arab League - both the Sunni Islamists who have done well out of the past year's democratic changes and autocratic, Western-backed leaders in the Gulf and elsewhere.
Alongside the announcement of a bunch of gaming computers today, HP is introducing a series of accessories so that it can try to sell gamers the entire package. That includes two displays, a gaming mouse, a mechanical keyboard, and an external GPU enclosure.
The external GPU may be the standout of the bunch (at the very least, it takes up the most room). It's called the HP Accelerator, and it's mostly just a big box with a power supply and space to hold a single graphics card and a hard drive. It also includes several additional ports, including four USB 3.0 and a single USB-C, and connects to a laptop over Thunderbolt 3.
Products like the Accelerator are meant to be plugged into a laptop to transform it into a much more powerful machine. It lets you leave some of the power of a desktop at home, while still running everything off of a relatively standard laptop.
HP's solution is a pretty nice alternative to something like Razer's Core. It's not clear yet if it'll support the same breadth of graphics card options, but HP's Accelerator stands out for including a slot for an external hard drive, too. It's also much cheaper, at $299.99
Unfortunately, HP isn't going to guarantee the Accelerator will work with anything but its own laptops. Mike Nash, who heads HP's consumer PC division, says that there's been too much variation in how Thunderbolt is used for HP to make any promises about compatibility with other companies' PCs.
Still, it's a nice option for gamers using HP's equipment. And it could be useful for anyone who wants to do video editing at their desk, too. The Accelerator goes on sale in August.
HP is also launching two displays for gaming. A 25-inch display with AMD's FreeSync, 1080p resolution, and two USB 3.0 ports will be available for $279.99. Then stepping way up, there'll be the 27-inch model with a QHD display, those same two USB ports, and Nvidia's G-Sync. HP says response time can get as low as 1 millisecond on both. The 27-inch goes on sale this week, and the 25-inch comes out at the end of the month.
And finally, HP is also launching a gaming mouse and a mechanical keyboard. The keyboard has Cherry MX Red switches and sells for $129.99. And HP now has its own mouse, instead of a co-branded SteelSeries model like it launched last year. The new model has adjustable weights and will sell for $59.99. Both accessories launch today.
The Montreal SPCA has launched a petition against the “cruel” event where “animals are subjected to fear, stress and undue risk of injury or even death.” At last count, the petition was at 14,000-plus signatures and going strong. In addition, 600 veterinarians and vet techs have signed a petition of their own.
NomadFest, the name given to the rodeo, claims all measures have been taken to ensure the animals are cared for.
“We believe that our reputation, pristine track record and professional demeanour back up our belief that our methods can be a benchmark in the world of entertainment using animals,” wrote Sophie Marsolais of SMAC Communications, the press agency representing NomadFest, in an email.
She cited information compiled by Pascal Lafrenière, the general manager of the Festival Western of St-Tite; Dr. Pierre Gauthier, a veterinarian; and Sylvain Bourgeois, the rodeo director for NomadFest and the Festival Western of St-Tite.
The city of Vancouver banned rodeos in 2006.
Marsolais provided further information emphasizing the prioritization of the animals' welfare (animals perform on average 10 to 15 times per year; in a competition of two days or more, the rodeo horses come out at most twice and the bulls come out at most three times because of their physical endurance; the animal injury rate is 0.0046 per cent) and explaining that a team of veterinarians is present in case of injuries during competition.
Animal deaths at Canada's largest rodeo
No one at NomadFest would deliberately hurt the animals involved. After all, they are a financial investment, and it's clear they're seen as such when the organizers state in the email that “these animals [are] worth a lot of money (between $ 2,500 and $ 250,000).” But the information provided ignores or downplays well-known facts.
Having vets on site has not prevented the deaths of hundreds of horses at the Calgary Stampede, Canada's largest rodeo, over the years from heart attacks, embolisms, and inevitable euthanasia after broken legs and other injuries have been sustained. In fact, the list of animal casualties compiled over the years by the Calgary Humane Society and the Vancouver Humane Society is long and alarming.
In 2005, nine horses were spooked while galloping across a city bridge (because the organizers thought the sight of 200 horses running through downtown Calgary would make for an awesome photo) and plunged to their deaths in the Bow River.
An old and cruel tradition
Of course, using animals for the sake of entertainment is an embarrassingly old human tradition. Circuses and cock, dog, and bull fighting use and abuse helpless animals, who obviously never consented to any of it.
Is that not in fact enough to consider Montreal's urban rodeo in clear violation of the new provincial animal welfare law?
But attitudes towards animal welfare have been changing. Numerous countries no longer allow cosmetics testing on animals, and legislation against animal cruelty and consequent penalties have been strengthened. Bullfighting is almost a relic of the past. England, Scotland and the Netherlands have banned rodeos, and many other countries prohibit certain rodeo events. Likewise, many U.S. states prohibit particular events as well the use of painful tools, such as the electric prod.
In Canada, the city of Vancouver banned rodeos in 2006. But in sharp contrast to the global tide of rising animal welfare awareness, Montreal and its current administration are reviving a cruel tradition that doesn't even have anything to do with the city's history, culture, and identity.
Animal welfare and the law
Legislation pertaining to farming practices has somehow extended to entertainment events. This means that rodeo events are not covered by Canadian animal cruelty laws because traditionally they have been considered “generally accepted practices of animal management” for the treatment of livestock.
The Canadian Veterinary Medical Association accepts the use of animals for entertainment and recreation when the physical, social and behavioural needs of the animals are met. But the Montreal SPCA asserts that rodeo animals are subjected to fear, stress and undue risk of injury or even death, which infringes on Quebec's newly enacted Animal Welfare and Safety Act, passed in 2016 to improve and expand animal protections. In fact, several sections of the new legislation make specific references to an animal being in distress if it is “exposed to conditions that cause extreme anxiety or suffering.”
Is that not in fact enough to consider Montreal's urban rodeo in clear violation of the new provincial animal welfare law? That's what lawyer Michael Simkin asked in a recent Huffington Post article. Sophie Gaillard, lawyer and animal advocate for the Montreal SPCA, said that “the possibility of bringing a legal challenge is certainly being discussed amongst those who oppose the rodeo.”
With the urban rodeo only four months away, and with public outrage by animal lovers in the city and across the country becoming louder, the chances are high that we may be hearing of one very soon.
Editors' note: This article originally stated that 600 veterinarians had signed a petition of their own. In fact, the number includes veterinarians and vet techs.
Hello Rocksmith fans!
After a little break since Mastodon (May 13th) we are finally returning to some on disc artist support for the DLC lineup.
This week's hint was a pushover for our forum friends.
The text is short hand for “Hole In The Earth”
As for what the image is of, @DanAmrich explains:
The clue image is actually a straight screencap from the “Hole In The Earth” video (from Deftones' own YT channel version, above), taken at 3:32, then cropped & rotated 180 degrees. I didn't add any additional filters to it because it came preloaded with effects. I almost think that worked in my favor a little bit, because people convinced themselves there was more to it than there actually was! I gotta keep you guessing.
As you might suspect if you are familiar with the band's music, everything is downtuned in one way or another. Let the speculation begin!
(BTW, in the last four weeks, DLC went from surfy-reverby to punky-aggro to jangly-poppy to alt-metally. We really are trying to mix it up.)
Dan, you didn't tell us if it was a five pack or not… That's not fair!
For those unfamiliar with Deftones, Hole In The Earth is a song that appeared on Guitar Hero 3 and then Rock Band in 2010.
Deftones isn't really my thing. I find their music boring, I think Chino has an awful voice, and they are one of the worst live bands I've ever seen- but they are definitely one of the more popular additions to the library this summer, and their songs will probably be fun to play and learn.*
*Unless you hate drop tuning I suppose.
the best Deftones song because Maynard
Those are last.f- err my picks. Do you think Deftones will get a 5 Pack? Do you care? Do you think I am an inhuman piece of garbage for not liking your favourite band? Leave a comment!

The Mouse that Roared or how the people of Bougainville defeated the Rothschilds
By Benjamin Fulford
2017/06/21
The Island of Bougainville in the South Pacific has been the scene of an epic decades-long struggle that resulted in locals, armed only with axes and bows, defeating troops armed with the latest world class weaponry. The battle pitched the natives fighting to retain their ancestral homes against a Rothschild multinational fighting to steal the worlds' largest gold deposits at the Panguna mine. As a result of their victory the Nasioi people of Central Bougainville became the first indigenous peoples in the world to force a global mining multinational to give up one of its richest ventures.
This is not just a local matter because there is so much gold on that Island that it could affect the future of the global financial system. The international bankers say there are only a few tens of billions of dollars' worth of gold and copper there, but, if we use the fractional reserve methods employed by the Federal Reserve Board in 2008 to price gold (700 tons of gold was turned into 750,000 tons worth of gold backed bonds), then it is worth hundreds of trillions of dollars.
Furthermore, locals say the mine was covering up a massive money laundering operation by claiming gold was copper, meaning the mine, and six other known rich gold reserves on the island, are potentially worth hundreds of trillions of dollars even without fractional reserve magic. “They would take the gold out at night and hide it in caves,” according to Bougainville Revolutionary Army sources.
The mine was operated by Rio Tinto Zinc from 1972 until 1989 before the locals shut it down, emerging victorious after a decade long war that resulted in the death of about 30,000 people or more than 10% of the population, according to BRA sources. A BRA general, “Joel” describes how the unarmed rebels were able to defeat a state of the art army. “When we first attacked them we only had axes and spears and knew that many of us would die,” he says. “We used guerilla tactics, we attacked one soldier and took his gun, with that gun we could kill 3 or 4 other soldiers and take their guns and so on; that is how we armed ourselves,” he says.
Red Cross officials working on the island also say that to this day there are extra-judicial murders and many “disappeared people,” as a result of the conflict on the island.
Furthermore, the resistance army won the war only to face a blockade that, to some extent, continues to this day.
Rio Tinto Zinc claims they have handed over control of the mine to Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL) that is mostly owned by the Autonomous Government of Bougainville (ABG). Rio Tinto also claims they are not liable for the enormous environmental damage they caused by dumping mercury and other poisonous mine slurry into a local river because they were abiding by local laws at the time. However, if you take a look at Bougainville Island on Google Earth you can still see clearly, decades after the mine closed, the scars on the landscape caused by it. They should not be allowed to get away with environmental destruction so great that it shows up on satellite photos.
The Twin Kingdom of Meekamui and Papala, the locals' name for the island, is headed by King David Peii II who wants to charge the owners of Rio Tinto with war crimes and sue them for environmental destruction at the International Court of Justice in the Hague.
The BCL people for their part, are trying to re-open the mine and promise to be nice to the environment this time but the locals are so bitter about the mass murder and environmental destruction that they do not want BCL or ABG to have any role whatsoever in the mine.
This is how King David views the situation:
ABG (Autonomous Bougainville Government) is simply an agent of the Government of Papua New Guinea. Its headquarters are located at Waigani, PNG. Whoever controls PNG also controls ABG. As you might be aware Australia granted independence to PNG in 1975. However, Australia still de facto controls PNG. According to 2011 statistics Australia raked about K19.8 Billion PGK [Papua New Guinea Kina, 1 kina=0.31 US dollars] from its companies in PNG but only gave about K450 million PGK back in the form of AusAid. That's about 3% only; 97% is retained in Australia. The borrower is a slave to the lender. PNGeans are happy to receive AusAid funds for their projects but don't know the real story.
ABG, was established because the Bougainville leadership split up immediately after winning the 10-year war against PNG and BCL/Rio Tinto. The VP Joseph Kabui decided to negotiate with the PNG Government due to lack of funds for services, etc, while the President Francis Ona did not think it was right to negotiate. Though both have now died and gone their successors are still alive and active. I am the successor of the late Francis Ona under the Twin Kingdom Agreement.
ABG is down at the bottom end of the international food chain of that old control system, and therefore, cannot say nay to BCL, Rio Tinto, PNG, Australia or their hierarchies or controllers because "it's a slave to its lenders".
BCL (B'ville Copper Ltd) is still owned by foreigners (or non-Bougainvilleans). The shares they claim to have given to ABG are still controlled by foreigners because ABG itself is a foreign agent on Bougainville anyway. ABG was established by its financiers (PNG & Australia, etc) to serve their own interests in our sovereign island nation.
What King David describes is true of much of the developing world where ruthless multinationals pillage the land with the help of mercenaries and locally hired and bribed “leaders.” It is estimated that multinationals loot Africa alone to the tune of $60 billion a year.
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jul/15/aid-africa-west-looting-continent
In that sense, the battle for Bougainville's gold could mark a global turning point because King David promises to use the vast funds from the mine to help other developing countries. Countries in Africa and other developing parts of the world would do far better being paid a fair price for their resources than receiving often useless “foreign aid” from the countries that are looting them.In any case, it is clear that somebody powerful went to a lot of trouble to try to prevent this writer from visiting King David. First of all, all flights into and out of Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea were cancelled the day after our arrival for unspecified reasons. The result was to delay the arrival of King David's representative, Mealagan Krishnan. Also, even though there are daily flights to the town of Arawa, a two and a half hour drive from the Kingdom's capital, these flights were mysteriously cancelled during the week of our visit. We were forced to take a flight to the town of Boka, a grueling 7 hour drive from the Kingdom and when we got there we found the main road was blocked by “a huge accident” forcing us to go by boat and back roads.One final literal roadblock was manned by BCL thugs who demanded a $1000 bribe to let us pass. When I told their boss “you cannot squeeze blood from a stone,” he answered “I can squeeze blood from a stone.” After much haggling we paid a $100 dollar cash bribe and were allowed to continue on our way. Overall, our arrival was delayed by 4 days.Finally, after meeting the King we were offered a tour of the Panguna mine on the following day. However, instead we were roused in the middle of the night with a warning that 10 truckloads of mercenaries and corrupt police officers were on their way to try to force the land-owners of the Panguna mine to sign over the rights of the mine to BCL. We were also told they would try to kill us.The locals felled trees across the road and set up armed road-blocks to stop the mercenaries from chasing us after we left. Armed conflict was avoided at the last minute but the BRA told us it was our arrival that led to the dispatch of the mercenaries.In any case, as a result of our visit, we will be appealing for international help to allow the locals to develop the mine on their own in an environmentally friendly manner. The King promises the billions or trillions of dollars that will flow from the mine will be used to help the people of Bougainville and the world.Though many of the Bougainevillians we met were barefoot, they carried smart-phones and knew more about the true nature of the international financial system than the average reporter from the Wall Street Journal seems to (I have met many of them over the years). I would rather have King David in charge of the Bougainville gold than the ruthless and incompetent Khazarian central bank gangsters who have done so much harm to this planet and its people.Both Rio Tinto Zinc and BCL ignored multiple attempts by this writer to contact them.
(Fort Worth, Texas) — Rahr & Sons Brewing Co. will release two new beers, named Drahthaar and USS Fort Worth, next month.
Drahthaar, which is a breed of German hunting dogs, is named in honor of the Rahr family's drahthaar, Schnapps. The beer is a double IPA with a bold malty flavor and a crisp aroma that includes notes of citrus, pine and grapefruit. It will be available the first week of August in 22-ounce bottles and on draft.
To celebrate the release of Drahthaar, Rahr & Sons will host a special tasting and tour at the brewery on Wednesday, August 5 from 5:00 to 7:30 p.m. All attendees will receive a commemorative pint glass, and Drahthaar will be the featured brew. Tickets are $10 and can be purchased at the door.
Rahr & Sons will release USS Fort Worth—an American session ale dedicated to the crew of the naval ship USS Fort Worth, a Freedom class littoral combat ship—the last week of August prior to Labor Day. The beer is light golden in color, crisp and clean with a medium body and a mild citrus finish. It will be available as a 12-ounce canned beverage and on draft; a portion of all sales will be donated to the USS Fort Worth Support Committee, which provides moral support and appreciation for the ship's crew and families.
“I am proud to live and work in the city of Fort Worth, and it is an honor to have our city's name on such prestigious naval ship with a first-class crew,” said Fritz Rahr, owner of Rahr & Sons. “We wanted to recognize the brave men and women of USS Fort Worth, as well as the other armed forces members with this special brew.”
The brewery will host a tasting from 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. on Saturday, September 5 to commemorate the release of USS Fort Worth. All attendees will receive an exclusive pint glass, and USS Fort Worth will be the featured beer on tap. Additionally, members of the U.S. Navy will be on hand to celebrate the occasion. Tickets are $10 and can be purchased at the door.

Three major players are officially in the high-stakes game to win Ontario's prized $3.3-billion-a-year lottery business, the Star has learned. Rogers Communications, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, and GTECH-Scientific Games are the only qualified bidders in the now-closed auction for Ontario Lottery and Gaming's lotto, sources say.
Finance Minister Charles Sousa says "reliability" will be a key factor in picking a winning bid for Ontario's lucrative lotto.

It had been thought Rogers' main telecommunications rival, Bell, may also make a pitch, but the Canadian corporate giant did not enter the bidding before it closed last month. Finance Minister Charles Sousa was tight-lipped about the bidders, whose identity is not supposed to be made public until November next year. “I'm not going to comment on any of them. The proponents are out there doing their work. They have a year. We'll make a decision in the fall of 2015 — they're working closely with the OLG,” Sousa said in an interview.

“They're going to put forward the best bid that they can get. I'm not even getting involved with who they are and where they're at because then it would be inappropriate to also have that access. We really want to keep this thing independent,” the finance minister said. “It's a big play.” Sousa did say “there's a lot of interest” in Ontario's lucrative lottery. “It is one of the items at OLG . . . that makes money and is a huge dividend to the province.” Asked if an Ontario-based bidder is preferred, Sousa said: “Again, I'm not going to comment too much on what . . . the parameters or the conditions that are coming forward, but, certainly, the best price is one of them and the best service and ability to deliver the goods — I mean, we want reliability.”
On September 8, OLG issued request-for-proposal (RFP) documents to the three “pre-qualified service providers.” The winning bid will run the day-to-day operations of Ontario lotteries, which include Lotto 6/49 and a slew of other games.

Industry insiders estimate OLG could make up to 25 per cent more money off the lottery by boosting online and smartphone ticket sales and expanding its customer base. Given that in 2012-13 the lotto generated $883 million in profits — on revenue of $3.3 billion — the potential windfall is significant. For a government saddled with a $12.5-billion deficit, signing a contract with a private operator appears to be a gamble worth taking. OLG's Tony Bitonti said the Crown agency can say little about the highly competitive bidding war now underway. “The integrity of the procurement system is such that I cannot comment on how many proponents other than to say that we are in the RFP,” Bitonti said in an interview. “We are starting the discussions with the proponents in terms of the contract negotiations. Any one of the proponents, we'll be happy to work with them. Again, the announcement will be made some time in the fall of 2015,” he said. “What we're doing is we're going through discussions with them and working on contracts. There's a lot of due diligence.” The would-be lotto operators were all similarly tight-lipped. “At Teachers', we don't comment on transaction speculation or rumours generally and that would be the situation in this case as well,” said Andrew Kondraski, a spokesman for the plan that had $140.8 billion in assets as of last Dec. 31. Sources say Teachers' bid is being handled by its subsidiary, Camelot Group, one of the world's biggest lottery operators. Camelot runs the U.K. National Lottery, the Irish National Lottery and provides consultancy and management services to the Interprovincial Lottery Corporation of Canada, the New York State Lottery, the Massachusetts State Lottery, the Texas State Lottery, and the Kentucky State Lottery. Also in the hunt is a joint venture by GTECH, an Italian company formerly known as Lottomatica Group S.p.A., and U.S.-based Scientific Games (SG). SG spokesman Mollie Cole said from Chicago that “it's an open procurement process and we're just not going to comment on it.” In Italy, GTECH officials did not return repeated messages from the Star. Even though GTECH and SG compete with one another in some lotto markets, they jointly operate the New Jersey Lottery in partnership with the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS) under the name Northstar. At this point, OMERS, which had $65.1 billion in assets as of last Dec. 31, is not involved in the OLG play. The lone newcomer to the lotto business is Rogers Communications, though the telecom titan's network of mobile phone, internet, and cable television customers is a potential gold mine for selling lottery tickets, insiders say. In an email, Rogers' director of communications Allison Fitton said: “We don't respond to rumours or speculation.” Sources say Rogers is expected to partner with an overseas lottery operator if it gets the green light. While there is much excitement at Queen's Park over the prospect of new revenue streams, a new poll suggests Ontarians are not sold on selling off the lottery. The Forum Research survey found 70 per cent of those oppose the scheme while 16 per cent approve and 13 per cent didn't have an opinion. “It's clear Ontarians don't want, by a very wide margin, their government to divest an asset they see as a moneymaker,” said Forum president Lorne Bozinoff. Using interactive voice response phone calls, Forum surveyed 1,079 people on Sept. 30 and Oct. 1 with results considered accurate to within three percentage points 19 times out of 20.

Call it Toronto's Uber-mess. The city's taxi industry is determined to run app-based Uber off the road. But the upstart service has no intention of leaving, with about 15,000 local drivers now carrying passengers in unmarked, private cars instead of cabs. It's popular and growing while taxi operators are angry and increasingly desperate.

That's a potentially explosive combination — one that needs to be defused this year. Violence has erupted in other places, including cabbies burning cars in Paris and vandalizing vehicles in Mexico City. Toronto's municipal leaders have stalled instead of finding an effective compromise. Confused rules, botched enforcement and political indecision have combined to bring deadlock to city hall and disruption to downtown streets. An ill-judged protest in mid-December had taxis blocking rush hour traffic, fueling rage among cabbies and frustrated commuters alike. A police officer received minor injuries after being hit by a slow-moving taxi; at least one ambulance was slowed; and an irate cab driver was caught on video hanging on to someone's car as it drove away.

It's essential to calm these tensions before someone is seriously hurt. Unfortunately, there's no easy app for that. City staff have tried, notably with a remarkable plan that would have imposed new regulations on Uber and lifted some of the restrictions burdening the traditional taxi industry. The goal was to arrive at a place where both sides claim they want to be: at a level playing field. Rather than endorsing that initiative last fall, city council eased up on the taxi industry but balked at balanced regulations that would have allowed the popular UberX service to operate. Council instructed staff members to study the matter some more and report back in the new year. They're doing so, but they're unlikely to propose regulations that are radically different from what's already been suggested. Their original, step-by-step package of reforms makes a great deal of sense. Recognizing the importance of having Uber drivers covered by appropriate insurance, these proposals called for the city to contact the province's insurance industry regulator to see if relevant policies were available.
Once the Financial Services Commission of Ontario issued a green light, staff would be in a position to set insurance requirements and draft other regulations covering “transportation network companies” like Uber. These regulations would centre on consumer protection, requiring such companies to conduct criminal record checks of their drivers, perform mechanical inspections, and maintain compliance records the way taxi and limousine operators do. Transportation network companies would also have to pay the city a licencing fee to cover the cost of administering and policing this system.

If all that were in place, taxi drivers couldn't reasonably claim that Uber was getting a free ride in Toronto — operating without paying the costs and shouldering the responsibilities that come with obeying municipal rules. It would also help if regulations covering the taxi industry were relaxed even further. City council has already shaved one dollar off a cab's initial pick-up fee, trimming the cost to $3.25. And it voted in favour of easing red tape and streamlining the inspection process. Another measure worth considering would be to allow cabbies to set fares in a more flexible manner, including opting for adjustable charges that rise and fall according to demand. That's how Uber operates, offering lower fares in general than a conventional cab but charging much more if a rainstorm, for example, increases calls for its service. Finding a middle way — giving conventional taxis a break while imposing suitable regulations on Uber — seems the best hope for dialing down tensions and moving forward on this contentious issue. City council should make this a key priority in the coming year. More dithering and indecision might take this city where it doesn't want to go: a place where chaos rules and everyone suffers in an out-of-control confrontation between the old and the new.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A Chicago police officer has been relieved of his duties after a video posted online showed him stomping on a man's head during an attempted arrest, officials said on Tuesday.
The officer will be relieved of duties while the Independent Police Review Authority investigates the incident, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement to Reuters.
The police department identified the two officers as white males, and the man being arrested as black, without giving names. The department did not say why the two officers were struggling with the man, but charges are pending against him.
“After careful consideration and reviewing the video footage, Superintendent (Eddie) Johnson has decided to relieve one of the officers involved in the incident,” Guglielmi said.
The incident comes as the third-biggest U.S. city's police department grapples with a strained relationship between officers and minority communities and amid a federal probe launched after the release last fall of a video showing a white police officer fatally shooting a black teenager.
The latest video was posted by a bystander on Facebook on Monday afternoon soon after the incident, according to the Chicago Tribune.
The video, which was later posted by several media outlets, showed a plainclothes police officer on top of a man, struggling to arrest him. A second police officer arrived on the scene on the city's West Side and began to direct bystanders away from the altercation. Moments later, the second police officer stomped on the man's head and he appeared to lose consciousness.
Mia Sissac, a spokeswoman for IPRA, confirmed the police watchdog agency was investigating the incident, but declined to provide further details.

Iran's currency has struck an all-time low this week, trading at 41,600 rials to $1. While making Iranian exports more attractive to the world market in the wake of the nuclear deal, it also means people's savings continue to lose value in the Islamic Republic. Meanwhile, concerns gather about what U.S. President-elect Donald Trump might mean for the atomic accord going forward, even as most Iranians have yet to feel any change from it.(AP Photo/Vahid Salemi)
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — At money changers across Tehran, shouting voices accompany each change of the signboards out front showing the value of the Iranian rial, which slips ever lower against the U.S. dollar.
This week saw Iran's currency fall to 41,600 rials to $1, its lowest point ever.
While making Iranian exports more attractive to the world market in the wake of the nuclear deal, it also means people's savings continue to lose value in the Islamic Republic. Meanwhile, concerns gather about what U.S. President-elect Donald Trump might mean for the atomic accord going forward, even as most Iranians have yet to feel any change from it.
“Surely this negatively impacts people's lives. Lots of foreign goods are imported into our country, and many of the things people need come from abroad,” said a Tehran resident who only gave his name as Babaei. “It also has a very negative psychological effect on the people.”
In that last 10 years, Iran has seen the rial go from around 9,200 to $1 to 41,600 to $1, a depreciation of some 450 percent. Much of that collapse came in 2012 over the country's contested nuclear program, when the U.S. banned the world's banks from taking part in Iran's oil economy and the European Union imposed an oil embargo.
Under the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, international sanctions against the country were lifted in exchange for it limiting its enrichment of uranium. In the time since, Iran has rushed to increase oil production to regain its lost market share while simultaneously signing deals worth tens of billions of dollars with airplane manufacturers Airbus and Boeing Co.
But the rial, initially buoyed by the accord, has now fallen. While those who could long-ago offloaded their rials for other investments, average Iranians have faced harder times.
“This is tragic to me,” said Ahmad Heidari, a 64-year-old retiree. “I have lost 20 percent of my purchasing power with this exchange rate because all prices are going up harshly.”
There are a host of reasons contributing to the rial's descent. Since Trump's election, the U.S. dollar has been strengthening. Meanwhile, Trump's unelaborated campaign promise to renegotiate the Iran deal has sparked uncertainty.
However, Iran's government in the past has manipulated its currency market to cover government budget deficits. It does that through using the difference between the lower government exchange rate and the higher market exchange rate to gain rials from oil sales, a move known in the financial world as arbitrage.
Hassan Salimi, the head of the Investment Group of Iran's Chamber of Commerce, has suggested arbitrage might be at play, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.
“The government believed that it could sell a barrel of oil from $65 to $70 in 2017, but now it is certain that the price of oil will stay around $50,” Salimi said Dec. 3. “Therefore, to make up for the deficit, it has increased the exchange rate.”
Government spokesman Mohammad Bagher Nobakht on Monday, however, tried to ease concerns over the rial drop.
“The government is discontent over (the) increasing of the exchange rate,” the state-run IRNA news agency quoted Nobakht as saying. “Our colleagues in the Central Bank are utilizing every instrument with economic logic to moderate and rationalize the currency exchange rate.”
Despite the pain, Tehran-based analyst Saeed Leilaz said there was opportunity for Iran's entrepreneurs.
“Their products become more competitive,” he said. “This is good for Iranians who wanted to export their product to the global markets.”

Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
An authorised Symantec reseller has been caught hoodwinking users into buying security software by employing underhand marketing tactics.
Silurian Tech Support was spotted flinging fake Norton-themed security warnings in an attempt to drum up business by Symantec rival Malwarebytes. The alerts were used to direct users towards a tech support service that researchers discovered offered to fix non-existent problems for a flat fee of $199 or more.
All the well-worn themes of the far-too-prevalent tech support scam were present, including a request to allow a technician to take remote control of a computer and the use of Windows EventViewer to trick people into thinking their PC was hopelessly compromised.
These and other scams were used in the “diagnostic phase” before the technician tried to pressure sell support services to Jérôme Segura, a Malwarebytes researcher posing as a hapless potential mark. It was only at the point payment was requested that the researchers discovered Silurian Tech Support was running the ruse.
Silurian Tech Support, which promotes itself through US dial-in numbers but which appears to be based in and around Chandigarh, northern India, is a member of the Symantec Partner Program.
Malwarebytes reported its findings to Symantec which acted promptly to sever its association with Silurian, as a statement from Symantec to The Register confirmed:
"While we can't say conclusively who was behind this particular scam, we can confirm that this particular site has been taken down and that we are also in the process of terminating our partner agreement with Silurian. After identifying any abuse of the Norton or Symantec brand, we pursue our rights and defend our intellectual property, and where necessary will work with law enforcement."
Silurian's website went down shortly after Malwarebytes reported the case to Symantec. El Reg contacted Silurian for comment on Malwarebytes accusations on via its Twitter account on Friday morning. We'll update this story as and when we hear back from the firm. ®
Joseph Stiglitz: Neoliberalism Is Dead
Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning economist and former adviser to US President Bill Clinton, says the consensus surrounding neoliberal economic thought has come to an end.
Speaking with Business Insider after the launch of his latest book, “The Euro: How A Common Currency Threatens the Future of Europe” — which argues that the fundamental flaws with the euro and the broader European economy are causing huge problems for the continent and risk leading to its downfall — Stiglitz argued that neoliberalism, the dominant school of economic thinking in the West for the past 30 years or so, is on its last legs.
Since the late 1980s and the so-called Washington Consensus, neoliberalism — essentially the idea that free trade, open markets, privatisation, deregulation, and reductions in government spending designed to increase the role of the private sector are the best ways to boost growth — has dominated the thinking of the world's biggest economies and international organisations like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
The policies of Ronald Reagan and Clinton in the US and Margaret Thatcher in the UK are often held up as the gold standard of neoliberalism at work, while in recent years in Britain George Osborne and David Cameron's economic policies continued the neoliberal tradition.
Since the 2008 financial crisis, however, there has been a groundswell of opinion in both economic and political circles to suggest that the neoliberal consensus may not be the right way forward for the world. In the past few years, with growth low and inequality rampant, that groundswell has gained traction.
Stiglitz, who won a Nobel Memorial Prize in economics in 2001 for his work on information asymmetry, has been one of neoliberalism's biggest critics in recent years, and he says the “neoliberal euphoria” that has gripped the world since the 1980s is now gone.
Asked by Business Insider whether he thought the economic consensus surrounding neoliberalism was coming to an end, Stiglitz argued: “I can talk about this from the point of view of academia or even in policy circles. In academia, I think it has pretty well become rejected.
“The young students are not interested in establishing that neoliberalism works — they're trying to understand where markets fail and what to do about it, with an understanding that the failures are pervasive. That's true of both micro and macroeconomics. I wouldn't say it's everywhere, but I'd say that it's dominant.
“In policymaking circles I think it's the same thing. Of course, there are people, say on the right in the United States who don't recognise this. But even many of the people on the right would say markets don't work very well, but their problem is governments are unable to correct it.”
Stiglitz went on to argue that one of the central tenets of the neoliberal ideology — the idea that markets function best when left alone and that an unregulated market is the best way to increase economic growth — has now been pretty much disproved.
“We've gone from a neoliberal euphoria that ‘markets work well almost all the time' and all we need to do is keep governments on course, to ‘markets don't work' and the debate is now about how we get governments to function in ways that can alleviate this,” he said.
In other words, Stiglitz says: “Neoliberalism is dead in both developing and developed countries.”
Stiglitz is not alone in his belief that neoliberalism has its problems, though his argument that the consensus is “dead” is somewhat more forthright than those of many others. In a blog post in May, three economists from the IMF — long one of the greatest champions of the neoliberal consensus — questioned the efficacy of some aspects of it, particularly when it comes to the creation of inequality.
“The increase in inequality engendered by financial openness and austerity might itself undercut growth, the very thing that the neoliberal agenda is intent on boosting,” Jonathan Ostry, Prakash Loungani, and Davide Furceri argued. “There is now strong evidence that inequality can significantly lower both the level and the durability of growth.”
“There are a lot of people thinking the same thing at this point, that basically some aspects of the neoliberal agenda probably need a rethink,” Ostry told the Financial Times on the day the blog was published, adding: “The crisis said: ‘The way we've been thinking can't be right.'”
The decline of neoliberalism
The decline of neoliberalism is also evident in the UK, where austerity has reigned since the accession of the Conservative Party to government in 2010. Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne presided over a period of record fiscal-deficit reduction created through a six-year programme of austerity.
But since Cameron resigned following the UK's vote to leave the European Union, fiscal stimulus in the UK has started to gain traction once again as a viable means of stimulating growth. It is widely expected that Philip Hammond, the new chancellor under newly installed Prime Minister Theresa May, will announce some form of fiscal easing at the Autumn Statement — which will come at some point before the end of the year (last year's was in late November). As Business Insider's Oscar Williams-Grut argued in mid-July, “Britain's age of austerity could be over.”
Across the Atlantic, both US presidential nominees, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, both favouring expanded government borrowing to fund infrastructure projects. As Randall W. Forsyth argued in Barron's magazine last week:
“We are all Keynesians now, President Richard Nixon famously declared after his New Economic Plan was unveiled in 1971. The notion seems to be echoing now, with the two major parties' presidential candidates calling for increased government spending, notably for infrastructure projects.”
Neoliberalism may not be completely dead, as Stiglitz argues, but it is certainly being challenged from many angles.
Story highlights A settlement is reached during Adam Carolla podcast trial
The terms of settlement agreement are confidential
High school friend Donny Misraje had sought $4.5 million in damages
Misraje claimed Carolla promised him a partnership
Comedian Adam Carolla settled a lawsuit Tuesday filed by a former friend of 30 years who claimed he had been cheated out of his share of Carolla's popular podcast.
Donny Misraje, a television editor and producer, had sought $4.5 million in damages from Carolla, his friend since their high school days in suburban Los Angeles. Misraje claimed to be the creative force behind Carolla's podcast and contended he was promised 30% of the company.
Carolla completed his testimony in Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday; Misraje testified last week and the case was winding to a close.
Terms of the settlement were confidential.
"It was a good deal for my side and a smart deal for his side," said Misraje's lawyer, Greg Doll.
The deal was reached after the judge issued a ruling that limited Misraje's claim for damages from 2009 to 2012, the year Carolla fired him. Misraje had sought a share of the podcast profits until 2017.
Carolla's lawyer, Mark Geragos, said the ruling caused the plaintiffs to blink.
Adam Carolla, left, and Donny Misraje worked together on The Adam Carolla Show.
"After Adam's compelling testimony yesterday and Judge (Michael) Johnson's ruling today gutting their expert's damage theory, apparently they finally woke up to the fact that their case was disintegrating before their very eyes," said Geragos, who also is a legal analyst for CNN.
Doll said several jurors told him they were leaning toward Misraje. The only question they had, he added, was how high the damage award should be.
The case told the story of the unraveling of a decades-long friendship between "Ace" Carolla and "The Weez" Misraje that began during the 1980s at North Hollywood High School.
Carolla was a frequent visitor at the Misrajes' home, often helping himself to food in the family refrigerator. When their other friends went away to college, the two rented an apartment and worked odd jobs. They rehabbed a 1964 Cadillac limousine, which they drove to clubs and parties, "Entourage"-style.
Carolla, now 50, eventually found his niche at a Los Angeles FM radio station, KROQ, and Misraje worked at several networks and syndicated television productions, including "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno." He now works as a producer at "The Queen Latifah Show."
Misraje claimed he came up with the idea for Carolla to launch his podcast in 2009 when he lost his L.A. morning radio show on CBS station KLSX. He claimed he was promised a cut of the business in a "handshake deal" but never got it in writing.
He told the jury that, based on his friend's word, he walked away from his $231,000-a-year job, took out a second mortgage on his home and encouraged his wife and cousin to join the business even though they might not see an immediate payday. The reason: Carolla was still bound to his CBS contract, which included a noncompete clause that kept them from soliciting revenue for the podcast during its first year.
Once the podcast started making money, Misraje contended, Carolla pushed him and the others out of the business.
Carolla, Geragos says, always maintained Misraje wasn't the only person who encouraged him to start a podcast. Carolla called Misraje a "partner" to humor him and honor their longstanding friendship, the lawyer said.
Carolla's popular podcast became the record holder, surpassing British comedian Ricky Gervais with nearly 60 million unique downloads between March 2009 and March 2011, according to Guinness World Records.
On Sept. 15, 2017, Litecoin creator Charlie Lee appeared on "The Twenty Minute VC" podcast and weighed in on everything from the ICO market to what he hopes for the future of Litecoin.
This is a must-listen-to podcast for anyone interested in cryptocurrencies.
It was so good that we decided to pull five of Lee's best quotes to share with Money Morning readers.
And one of his most important quotes was about the future of the initial coin offering (ICO) market…
Charlie Lee on ICOs
"I fear that there's going to be a huge crash in the whole ICO market, sometime soon."
Through ICOs, companies can raise funds while bypassing the roadblocks associated with IPOs, including securities laws and costly underwriters.
In exchange for Bitcoin or Ethereum, investors will receive a newly created digital coin from the firm. The coin can be used in exchange for the company's services, and buyers hope the new cryptocurrency they received will rise in value if the projects are successful.
Now, because ICOs aren't regulated and they aren't promising shares in the company or any tangible asset, ICOs can be more speculative than a traditional IPO. In other words, coin buyers are taking risks that the coin's price will jump without receiving anything in return. That sort of speculation could create a bubble that will eventually pop.
Some are even calling ICOs the "Wild West" of investing, and China announced in September that they are banning them.
Charlie Lee on the Biggest Misconceptions About Cryptocurrency
"People think you have to buy one whole Bitcoin or one whole Litecoin. People didn't realize you can actually buy a small portion of a Bitcoin."
When investing in stocks, you have to buy one whole share. For an investor who wants to own one share of Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN) today, they would have to pay $973.21. Gold coins can be bought in increments of 1/10 oz, 1/4 oz, 1/2 oz, or a full ounce, but that still limits your investment options.
Video Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Invest in Today
One Bitcoin costs $3,880.93, and one Litecoin costs $51.75, but you don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin or a whole Litecoin. According to digital currency exchange Coinbase, you can purchase as little as $1.00 worth of Bitcoin or Ethereum.
And Lee said people believing they have to buy a full Bitcoin or Litecoin is one of the biggest misconceptions about the digital currency market right now.
That means you can invest only the amount you want to, instead of needing to pay for an entire coin at once, which could be costly.
What Charlie Lee Believes That Others Don't Believe
"I believe that cryptocurrency will take over fiat currency and become the reserve currency."
Some may scoff, but Lee believes a digital currency could eventually become the world's reserve currency.
And there are two big reasons to believe a digital currency could take over as the reserve currency…
First, inflation is constantly weakening the value of the dollar, the world's current reserve currency. According to TheBalance.com, a person with just $4.26 in 1915 could buy the same amount of food, clothes, and other necessities that $100 would buy today.
If inflation increases at the same rate over the next 100 years, it may cost $2,000 or more to buy the same amount of food, clothes, and other necessities in 2117 that you were able to buy for $100 in 2017.
You see, the Fed can print more money to try and pay off debt or stimulate the economy. As more dollars enter circulation, prices will rise. That means you'll eventually need more dollars to purchase the same products as in the past.
But Bitcoin doesn't have this problem. There is a finite amount of Bitcoin – pegged at 21 million coins – that can't be expanded. Bitcoin is worth what people are willing to pay for it, and its value can't be manipulated.
Second, the dollar is under threat from countries who believe its role as reserve currency gives the United States too much power.
China is actively trying to replace the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency.
"The desirable goal of reforming the international monetary system, therefore, is to create an international reserve currency that is disconnected from individual nations," China's central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said in a 2009 speech at the Council of Foreign Relations.
Special Report: Cannabis Is the Gold Rush of the 21st Century – 30 Stocks to Invest in Now. Details here…
Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin could be the disconnected currency China is hoping for.
Charlie Lee's Vision for Litecoin
"My vision is people would use Litecoin every day to buy things. It would just be the payment method of choice."
Litecoin can handle a higher volume of transactions, making it more suitable for as a payment. Litecoin can generate a block in 2.5 minutes, while it takes Bitcoin about 10 minutes. The faster time will make it more attractive for everyday purchases.
It could be used more for payments, while Bitcoin could be used as a storage of value, like gold.
So far, Lee's prediction hasn't come to fruition. Outside of a few smaller companies and operations, there aren't any large merchants that accept Litecoin.
But as digital currencies become more mainstream, that could change.
What Charlie Lee Thinks Will Take Crypto to the Next Level
"Being able to securely store it and still have easy access to your money is the holy grail of crypto. Once we solve that, then it could take over."
Digital currencies are becoming easier to buy for mainstream investors, but storing and spending them isn't as convenient as using a credit card.
Digital currency can be stored in a "hot wallet," which is an online address users can use to hold their digital currencies in. However, because the wallet is connected to the Internet, some users want more security.
Digital currencies can be transferred to a "cold wallet," which is a storage device not connected to the Internet. Online hackers can't get into it, but you also can't easily access your digital currencies.
Lee believes that digital currencies will become mainstream when security and easy spending access are combined.

Nicola Roxon calls on 'bastard' Kevin Rudd to quit Parliament in John Button lecture
Updated
Former attorney-general Nicola Roxon has delivered a scathing character assessment of Kevin Rudd, describing him as a "bastard" and calling on him to quit Parliament.
Ms Roxon meted out a lengthy critique of Labor's six years in government as she delivered the John Button Memorial Lecture in Melbourne yesterday evening.
The retired Labor politician was heavily critical of Mr Rudd's leadership style, saying he showed reservations about letting cabinet make big strategic calls and would focus on minutiae to avoid "harder decisions".
A close ally of Julia Gillard, Ms Roxon slammed Mr Rudd's infamous temper and said the government was left weaker because he ignored the advice of his colleagues.
"Although I was frustrated beyond belief by his disorganization and lack of strategy, I was never personally a victim of his vicious tongue or temper," she said.
Key points Nicola Roxon served as health minister under Kevin Rudd and attorney-general under Julia Gillard.
Delivered 10 "housekeeping tips" for future Labor governments, including "being polite" and "choosing good people".
Said Mr Rudd was rude to staff, ignored advice, and was a "bastard" to colleagues.
Said Labor was right to dump Mr Rudd, but said it was handled poorly.
Described Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek as Labor's "dream team".
The John Button Memorial Lecture is delivered annually, honouring the ALP luminary who served in the Senate from 1974 to 1993.
"I did, however, see how terribly he treated some brilliant staff and public servants.
"Good people were burnt through like wildfire - losing senior people like chiefs of staff and deputies or contemptuously ignoring their advice left the government weaker."
Labor's communication issues were a constant topic throughout the lecture as Ms Roxon lived up to her promise to use Button's "tell it as it is" style.
Ms Roxon spoke of massive communication issues in the Labor cabinet, saying in hindsight she and other ministers should have insisted on bringing important discussions to the fore.
"There were some contentious issues and policy problems that ran for months, in some cases years, without there seeming to be a way to bring contentious issues to a head," she said.
Removing Kevin was an act of political bastardry, for sure, but this act of political bastardry was made possible only because Kevin had been such a bastard himself to too many people already. Nicola Roxon
"There was no avenue for ministers to bring genuinely difficult issues, where there were legitimately tricky calls to be made, to cabinet for a real discussion.
"Health and climate change were the two longest running 'non-discussions' for the first term of government, with some other contentious policies getting only cursory cabinet approval at the last minute."
Ms Roxon also recalled television cameras capturing Mr Rudd "icily ignoring" former NSW premier Kristina Keneally during COAG negotiations, something she said ultimately cost the federal government.
"It actually gave New South Wales the upper hand in negotiations for the first time," she said.
"Disparagingly calling her Bambi behind closed doors was pretty silly when in fact she was whip smart and actually went on to run rings around us at the final COAG negotiating table."
Labor "clumsy" in Rudd removal
Ms Roxon said if Mr Rudd had been a regular employee he would have won his unfair dismissal case because Labor did not properly explain why he was sacked.
She said while the Labor caucus made the right decision in removing Mr Rudd as leader, she said "we were clumsy and short-sighted in the way we did it".
"We didn't explain the dysfunctional decision-making and lack of strategy I've focused on a lot tonight," she said.
"We didn't talk about his rudeness, or contempt for staff and disrespect for public servants.
"Removing Kevin was an act of political bastardry, for sure, but this act of political bastardry was made possible only because Kevin had been such a bastard himself to too many people already.
"Even though the reasons were there to justify our action, I don't think we handled it properly at the time, and Labor has paid a very high price for this mishandling ever since."
Call for Rudd to quit
Ms Roxon said polling agencies would always compare Mr Rudd's potential popularity to whoever held the Labor leadership, and that he needed to quit parliament for the good of the party.
"I believe we must also confront the bitter truth that as long as Kevin remains in Parliament, irrespective of how he behaves, pollsters will run comparisons with him and any other leader," she said.
Nicola Roxon's 10 tips for Labor Labor must always focus on the fact that good policy improves people's lives and that is why the party exists.
Governments as a whole, and the prime minister in particular, need to keep their focus high level - spending time and energy on the things that really matter.
Good leaders are good delegators.
Labor needs to welcome debate, not fear it.
Be polite and be persuasive. Or I could call this "Keep yourself nice".
Always ask what you can do for the party (and the nation) not what it can do for you (with apologies to JFK).
Good governments run best with good diaries - so boring, but universally true.
Choose good people - as leaders, as MPs and as staff.
Accept you are not always right, and cannot always fix everything. It's easier with this as your starting point.
And lastly, never forget polling is only a snapshot, not a predictor.
"In my opinion - and it is only my opinion - for the good of the federal parliamentary Labor Party and the movement as a whole, Kevin Rudd should leave the Parliament. Otherwise the action of any Labor leader will always be tested through the prism of popularity compared to him.
"As well as being constantly unsettling, we should've learned this is not a recipe for success either."
Ms Roxon may have been a staunch supporter of Ms Gillard, but their friendship did not stop the former prime minister from coming under criticism.
"In 2007, Kevin was great at cut-through, then struggled at follow-through," she said.
"In contrast, Julia was brilliantly thorough at delivering, but couldn't always deliver the message."
Ms Roxon said both leaders took on too much of the workload as prime minister, and should have delegated responsibility better.
She said Mr Rudd had a "fatal attraction" to other people's problems, describing his response to the Fukushima nuclear disaster and the Victorian bushfires as "overreach".
"This desire to fix the world's problems became crushingly exhausting for Kevin and debilitating for the government," she said.
"Julia also took on too much - as the new leader, the promised "fixes" were all attached to her, she wore every mistake and every setback."
Mr Rudd has declined to comment on Ms Roxon's remarks, with his office saying he is focused on policies for Australia's future rather than the internal politics of the Labor Party.
Shorten and Plibersek the "dream team"
It was not all doom and gloom throughout the lecture, with Ms Roxon declaring she was optimistic about the ALP's future under Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek.
Ms Roxon praised the ballot that saw Mr Shorten elected as Labor leader and hailed the ALP's incoming parliamentary talent, including the party's first Indigenous senator, Nova Peris.
She also pointed to MPs Catherine King, Shayne Neumann, and Andrew Leigh as politicians who are stepping up as Labor rebuilds after its election defeat.
"I reckon Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek are as close to 'the dream team' as you can get," she said.
"This time of rebuilding is a chance for others who have not been utilised enough to date to come to the fore.
"In busy political life, time must be taken to get the right people and a good mix in your office of those with technical skills, political skills and maturity."

Mendocino County to turn over medical marijuana records
Mendocino County officials will turn over to federal prosecutors records from their now-defunct medical marijuana permitting program to comply with new grand jury subpoenas, the county counsel's office announced Wednesday.
It remains unclear exactly what documents are being relinquished to the U.S. Attorney's Office. County Counsel Thomas Parker said the Sept. 25 subpoenas seek "a limited number of unredacted county records."
"The Board of Supervisors directed that the records be provided to the federal grand jury as requested by the subpoenas," he wrote in a news release.
The move follows a year of legal wrangling over efforts by federal prosecutors to get their hands on paperwork from the program, which was scrapped in January 2012 under threat of a federal lawsuit after less than two years in operation.
Mendocino County Supervisor John Pinches said the decision to relent reflects the board's desire to avoid incurring any more legal fees, and a belief that much of the information is available through other means.
"If the feds want to keep coming after us, they can keep coming after us, but we're not going to keep spending money," Pinches said.
The medical marijuana program was adopted in March 2010 to clarify the county's policy under California's voter-approved Compassionate Use Act of 1996, Sheriff Tom Allman has said.
The county ordinance allowed individual growers to cultivate up to 25 plants and collectives to seek waivers for as many as 99 plants. Collectives had to pay $1,500 for special permits, as well as monthly inspection fees of about $500, and $50 per plant for specialized zip ties identifying authorized plants.
Allman said close to $830,000 generated from growers over the life of the program was channeled into his budget to cover the cost of administering it.
But the program was abandoned during a federal crackdown on marijuana cultivation that included raids on California medicinal marijuana clubs and those who grew weed for them.
Last October, several Mendocino County officials received grand jury subpoenas seeking "any and all records" related to the permitting program, raising fears of that applicants' personal information would end up with federal prosecutors.
County supervisors fought back, in large part to protect the identities of more than 90 people who had permits to grow pot for medicinal use, as well as the confidential medical and financial information they provided to participate.
In April, the county reached a settlement with the U.S. Attorney's Office that said county supervisors could edit personal identifying information from records, including names, addresses and parcel numbers.
But Parker said Wednesday the county will release unedited records to federal prosecutors under new, more narrowly drawn subpoenas.
Both he and the sheriff said they were prohibited by federal law from elaborating or identifying what records were being turned over. They also would not discuss whether the records contained any personal information on permit holders.
The news release quoted Mendocino County Board Chairman Dan Hamburg as saying: "The Board desires to protect the privacy of...participants. We are glad to see the current request for documents is much more narrowly drawn than the October 2012 request."
Hamburg has been outspoken about his desire to protect the privacy of participants. He was not available for further comment Wednesday.
It remains unclear who or what federal prosecutors are targeting in their probe.

Product brochures from the secretive Gamma Group, a German-based company that makes surveillance equipment for law enforcement, have supposedly been leaked online. The brochures were published anonymously and their authenticity has not been verified, but they appear to explain some of Gamma's cutting-edge spy gear in further detail than was known before.
If real, this is James Bond-level stuff. One of the products is a body-worn device that can capture the unique identifier of a person's cell phone and use that to track the target's whereabouts. Another device, described by Ars Technica, can monitor the target's text messages and even deny service to phones that use the GSM network without alerting the target user. Other devices allow for live monitoring of calls.
This is James Bond-level stuff
The documents also describe Gamma's flagship spyware product, FinFisher, which is basically PRISM-lite for state and local law enforcement (and possibly the Australian Federal Police). Various products in the FinFisher suite can allegedly capture user names and passwords, monitor Skype calls, remotely turn on and record audio from the target computer's microphone, and even watch a target's screen in real time.
Gamma Group, along with its partner Elaman GmbH, is a pioneer in the relatively new market for commercial hacking software. Gamma's products allow law enforcement to hack into targets' computers and cell phones. They use many of the same techniques that sparked outrage in the context of the National Security Agency's PRISM program and in some cases go even further. According to the new documents, the company even offers training courses such as "FinTraining Intensive Basic Hacking Course."
FinFisher and Gamma are getting more scrutiny as the company grows, however. The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab identified FinFisher command and control centers in 11 countries. The software has been criticized for being used to target human rights activists, and the original source for the leaked documents has been pulled down due to the influx of traffic.
Marking its first birthday this month, Jewish Rock Radio has a lot to celebrate. The 24-7 online radio station — which plays big names like Matisyahu, Israeli groups like Hadag Nachash, classics like Debbie Friedman and numerous emerging artists — is the youngest of the 50 groups highlighted in this year's Slingshot Resource Guide for Innovation.
The station “has broken new ground in Jewish mass communication,” the guide, released last month, noted, adding that JRR “has made it possible for anyone with an iPhone, iPad, Android device or even just an [I]nternet connection to … hear high-quality streaming music and Jewish community messages.”
Over 10,000 free JRR mobile apps have been downloaded so far, and listeners collectively clock over 500,000 listening minutes per month. Many Jewish federations and other institutions, including New York's East End Temple and the Union for Reform Judaism's Camp Harlam embed the station onto their websites, and while JRR does not directly sell music, it is becoming an important venue for connecting Jewish artists to listeners. JRR is also developing a study guide to help schools teach about Judaism through music and technology.
The Jewish Week spoke with JRR founder Rick Recht, 41, a St. Louis-based Jewish rock-folk musician (his nine albums include “Simply Shabbat” and “Look at Me”) who performs around the country.

Q: Why did you start Jewish Rock Radio?
A: I was involved with an initiative called Tear Down the Walls, which brings together teens from different backgrounds and culminates in a multidenominational, interfaith concert … We were doing some of these concerts in mega-churches, and I got to meet really bright pastors and to see the ways they were meeting the needs of families by using online radio … There's a powerful trend in online radio: two years ago there were 30-40 million Americans listening to online radio each month, and now there are about 100 million Americans listening each month. That, put together with a study MTV did on teens, showing the strong impact music has on their lives, made me realize the Jews need a mass communications channel.
I can't help but notice that in the same year Jewish Rock Radio has emerged, JDub — another innovative startup that focused on outreach to young Jews through music (through a record label, among other ventures) — was forced to close. Is JDub's failure an ominous sign?
We play a lot of the JDub artists, and I'm a big fan of [JDub founder] Aaron Bisman and what JDub did. I was really sad to see it close its doors. Its business model was no longer supporting it, and that's why it closed. It was not about their mission or their direction, it was not a statement about the power of music and media or about how it attracts and inspires Jewish youth … If anything, what JDub closing shows is that the value of music as a commodity that can be monetized is slipping. That doesn't mean the power of music is slipping; people just don't want to buy it. Fortunately, our business model is not based on music sales at all, but on two things: philanthropy and advertising.
You were raised in a Conservadox home in St. Louis, then went to college in Los Angeles, where you played in a [secular] rock band for many years. What made you shift to Jewish music 12 years ago?
When my mother got cancer, I moved back to St. Louis and worked several years as a rock-folk artist, touring a lot of colleges and, in between trips, teaching guitar. One of my students was a Jewish day camp director, who was taking guitar because there were no Jewish song leaders in St. Louis. She would joke with me about me becoming a Jewish song leader, and I was totally uninterested. I had never worked with kids before, didn't know Jewish music and had never even been to Jewish camp. But since I always took a month off in the summer from touring, I took a job at her camp, and it was like an epiphany for me … I started writing music for the kids at the camp — I was writing Jewish music all of a sudden and the people who knew me were like, what's happening to you?! I started touring Jewish summer camps … The punch line of the story is my guitar student is now my wife Elisa [they now have two sons, age 7 and 9] … Something I realized from the beginning is that Jewish music is a different medium: I'm an educator, and my vehicle is music. It's an unbelievably powerful tool for education, but it doesn't feel like education; it feels like a rock concert.
I notice that Jewish Rock Radio plays on Shabbat, even though traditional Jews cannot use technology or play instruments then.
It's taped ahead of Shabbat. We play the best of contemporary Jewish rock Shabbat music all through Shabbat and get a lot of great feedback. A lot of [liberal Jews] want something in the background that creates the spirit of Shabbat.

In the game of thrones, you win or you die. In the game of modern sports, you win or you get booed on talk radio. And those aren't the only similarities to these two worlds: Both the various houses in Game of Thrones and the various NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL franchises are each associated with a crest, a philosophy, and a region, and wherever their acolytes travel and whomever they marry, their allegiances remain. So with that in mind, we thought that the heraldic insignia of Westeros could be jazzed up a bit, following the leads of the various modern leagues. Not only would the houses look better and more united on the battlefield, but just imagine how much they'd make in merchandising coin!

What the fuck is PCR?
PCR is a laboratory protocol for generating significant numbers of copies of a subsequence of a DNA template, via repeated exposure to an enzyme capable of synthesizing molecules of DNA.
How does it work?
Short nucleotide sequences called primers are specifically made-to-order to bind (complement) to the start and end of a sequence of interest (for some extracted DNA)
are specifically made-to-order to bind (complement) to the start and end of a sequence of interest (for some extracted DNA) DNA (the template ) is prepared with those primers , dNTPs (basically loose nucleotides) and a polymerase enzyme

Typically can amplify subsequences of template up to 10kbp
What do I need?
Reagents
Ice box containing: Taq polymerase Taq buffer Template DNA dNTP mix Forward and reverse primers
Fridge box containing: HPLC-grade water
Equipment
Vortex
Centrifuge
Thermal Cycler
Access to HPLC-grade water dispenser and UV Crosslinker
Bits and pieces4
P2, P10, P100, P200, P1000 pipettes (and appropriate tips)
Eppendorf tubes (500ul, 1.5ml)
PCR tubes (200ul) + caps (if not attached)
Multi-format tube rack
Waste bin
Gloves
What are those things?
Taq polymerase
A highly thermostable polymerase enzyme (a molecular machine for assembling long chains of nucleic acids) isolated from (and named after) the Thermus aquaticus bacterium; an extremophile that is capable of thriving in high temperature environments (favouring 70°C, but tolerating anything between 60-80°C). Polymerase drives the elongation or extension process of PCR. In the late 1980s, it was discovered that polymerase isolated from Thermus aquaticus could actually withstand the temperatures involved in the annealing step where DNA is melted into its two strands. The polymerase was refined and mass produced for commercial sale; now PCR could be completed without re-adding a polymerase at the end of every cycle!
Taq buffer
PCR buffers attempt to maintain optimal conditions for the activity of polymerases during PCR. Various ingredients can chelate ions that are required for enzymatic activity to reduce degradation of reagents, and unwanted reactions.
Template DNA
Your already extracted and purified DNA sample that contains some sequence that you desire to amplify.
dNTP Mix
Named so as deoxynucleoside triphosphate doesn't roll off the tongue so well. dNTP mix is essentially a grab bag of the four nucleotides. During the elongation cycle of PCR, polymerases utilize free dNTPs to synthesize new chains of nucleic acids to create complementing strands.
Primers
A pair of short sequences ( 15-30bp ) of nucleic acids designed to complement two ends of a target subsequence of interest on your template DNA. Good primers are 40-60% GC-content, have similar annealing temperatures and should not be self-complementary, or complementary to another primer in the mix.
HPLC-grade water
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a technique to identify and separate individual components of a mixture. HPLC-grade water is deionized, filtered, UV-filtered and in general, pretty fucking clean. The goal is to prevent contamination of reagents with nucleases.
How do I make the PCR happen?
Pre-prep
Gather equipment, ensure your reagents are not depleted, check whether someone has stolen the power lead for the thermal cycler
Place tube racks in freezer to keep them cold (this helps maintain the integrity of reagents)
Collect HPLC water (if necessary) and run through UV crosslinker to denature any residual proteins
Prep
Retrieve tube racks from freezer
Move dNTPs, primers and template from ice box onto tube rack to thaw, it is essential that these are returned to the ice box as soon as possible once fully thawed
NEVER allow Taq Polymerase to reach room temperature.
Ensure reagents have fully thawed to avoid aspirating solutes of incorrect concentrations.
Briefly vortex and centrifuge (a few seconds at ~ 5-10Krpm ) Taq buffer and dNTP mix
The buffer must be vortexed to ensure its components are mixed thoroughly.
Prepare a working dNTP mix (if required)
dNTP mix is often shipped at a high concentration ( 100mM ) and in such cases must be diluted to a more practical “working mix” before it is practical to pipette into PCR tubes. This also prevents having to repeatedly freeze-thaw your master mix.
Calculate the volume of master dNTP mix required to create a more practical solution; say 250ul at a concentration of 2mM :
required to create a more practical solution; say at a concentration of : Aspirate and dispense the solvent first (it is easier to pipette a small volume into a larger one). For our 250ul working mix that contains 5ul of the master mix, we must dispsense 245ul of HPLC water into a 1.5ml Eppendorf tube.
working mix that contains of the master mix, we must dispsense of into a Eppendorf tube. Vortex and centrifuge the dNTP mix briefly if you have not already done so
briefly if you have not already done so Add 5ul of master mix to the new working mix tube
of master mix to the new working mix tube Aspirate and dispense repeatedly and carefully to wash the pipette tip and mix the new solution
Return the 100mM master mix and new suitably labelled 2mM working mix to the ice box
Preparing the PCR tubes
Lay out the necessary number of required PCR tubes on a cold rack
Calculate all necessary dilutions before you begin pipetting (consider your protocol parameters; reaction size, desired dilutions of template, primer and dNTP mix): dNTPs
Primers (forward and reverse)
Although the protocol specification requires a final concentration of between 0.1-1.0uM of each primer, it seems that in general (your mileage will vary), people tend to add excess to give a final concentration up to 2uM. For example 2ul of a 50uM ( 50pmoles/ul ) working primer solution. Template
you begin pipetting (consider your protocol parameters; reaction size, desired dilutions of template, primer and dNTP mix): Remove Taq Buffer from ice box and pipette the volume required by your protocol (my protocol stated 10ul ) into all tubes, return the temperature-sensitive Taq Buffer to ice (or the freezer) as soon as possible
It is highly recommended that Taq Buffer is the reagent to be added first. As a buffer, it is responsible for preventing unwanted enzymatic activity such as denaturing (or early annealing) of template DNA and primers.
The rest of the reagents can be added in no particular order, with the exception of Taq Polymerase , which comes later: dNTPs Primers (ensure both forward and reverse primers are added) Template DNA
, which comes later: For each tube, sum the volumes of its reagents (don't forget the polymerase, which is not yet in the tube) and subtract this total from the target volume required by your protocol (again, here, 50ul )
) Add those amounts of HPLC water (the volume to add may differ between tubes if differing volumes of primer or template were added) to bring up the total volume of each sample tube to the target volume (less the polymerase)
(the volume to add may differ between tubes if differing volumes of primer or template were added) to bring up the total volume of each sample tube to the target volume (less the polymerase) Ready (switch on and program) the thermal cycler before adding Taq Polymerase (reactions begin as soon as it is added, albeit at room temperature)
(reactions begin as soon as it is added, albeit at room temperature) Remove Taq Polymerase from ice, vortex gently and centrifuge briefly to remove excess from the walls of its tube 5
from ice, vortex gently and centrifuge briefly to remove excess from the walls of its tube Add between 0.5–2.0 units of polymerase per 50ul reaction, our protocol recommended 1.25u , I added slightly more to make it easier to aspirate with a pipette, return to ice (or freezer) as soon as possible
of polymerase per reaction, our protocol recommended , I added slightly more to make it easier to aspirate with a pipette, return to ice (or freezer) as soon as possible Seal PCR tubes (close lids or seal caps6)
Thermal Cycling
Load tubes into thermal cycler immediately (your reaction has begun!)
If you are feeling particularly prepared, you could preheat the lid of your cycler to ensure the hot-start PCR begins more quickly.
Ensure lid is as tight as possible (if it has a lid that needs manual tightening to push the heated block 7 against the tops of tubes)
against the tops of tubes) Load and check program schedule (does it have a sensible run time? Has someone in your lab accidentally sabotaged it in the last five minutes?)
Ensure there is an infinite store step at less than 5°C following the end of the final cycle of your program. Unless you want all of your work destroyed at room temperature. This is especially important if you are running PCR before going home for 12 hours.
Run program!
Watch in horror as you allow the machines to take over everything and probably ruin your experiment
What do I do now?
PCR product must be kept in the fridge or freezer
Verify fragments of the expected size (or anything at all) were amplified with gel electrophoresis
How do I fuck it up?
There are a multitude of ways that PCR can fail. Due to the number of reagents required in each tube, and lots of pipetting it is quite trivial to make a mistake. Helpfully, it is typically not possible to establish the cause and the process must be repeated. Lots of attention to detail is required, especially if there is more than one template, or more than one set of primers that make up individual reactions.
Starbucks has said for years that it offers over 87,000 drink menu combinations, but just recently a new secret menu has been revealed by loyal Starbucks customers. There are some famous other secret menus, the best being In-n-Out's Super Secret Menu.
I definitely need to check out some of these awesome new drinks at Starbucks.
Biscotti Frapuccino : Buy a biscotto and ask the barista to blend it up with any flavor of frapuccino. It blends into tiny cookie chunks that add a delicious little crunch to your frozen coffee.

Schenectady
If seeing is believing, then state Gaming Commission member John Poklemba seemed impressed by the progress being made on Rivers Casino in Schenectady.
"What we've heard here preliminarily has been very promising, and we want to make sure we can see with our own eyes what they've told us they've progressed so far," said Poklemba Monday afternoon before he and other officials joined executives from gaming operator Rush Street Gaming of Chicago on a tour of the Erie Boulevard facility. "I think we want to make sure the integrity of the project is maintained in all forms."
The $330 million casino is the major attraction of the $480 million mixed-use development on the former Alco site that includes a harbor with 50 boats slips.
Before the news conference, Greg Carlin, CEO of Rush Street Gaming, said the casino could open in February.
All along, he and others have said that the gambling hall would open in the first part of 2017. Poklemba said he believed Rivers Casino would be the first of those under construction in the state to welcome patrons.
Carlin later told reporters that "we're a little bit ahead of construction schedule and things are going well," thanks in a large part to the mild winter.
Mary Cheeks, general manager of Rivers Casino & Resort at Mohawk Harbor, said training for dealers will begin in October.
"Our strategy is to train as many people as we can and then from there start the hiring process," said Cheeks.
She estimated that they could hire upwards of 120 people for jobs at the casino.
Rush Street will run the 50,000-square-feet gambling hall, which will feature 66 table games and 1,150 slot machines. The 150,000-square-foot main facility also will feature a steakhouse, entertainment lounge, restaurant with light fare, spa and banquet hall. A 150-room hotel and parking garage will be attached to the casino.
The 60-acre site on Erie Boulevard will also include a second hotel, condos and apartments, and retail and office space for tech firms.
Last week, the Planning Commission approved the site plan for a 4,000-square-foot coffee shop and bank.
Poklemba also talked about casino regulations and the monitoring that will take place once the facility is open.
"We believe we've taken the best aspects from every state that is now regulating the industry and included them in our regulations," he said. pnelson@timesunion.com • 518-454-5347 • @apaulnelson
Who says we can't have nice things? I recently went to the local Asian grocery store and these quail eggs caught my eye. I've never cooked them before or really seen them used but I knew I had to try them! I made some mini almond buns and using my whoopie pie pan, topped them with some cheese, bacon, and a quail egg; breakfast is served!
Here's the finished product! They turned out super awesome and would make a great weekend breakfast or tapas menu item! This recipe starts with the standard almond buns. You can also check out the video on YouTube. The only difference is instead of using a muffin top pan I used a whoopie pie pan. The whoopie pie pan results in a smaller bun and the edges are round instead of square. While the buns are cooking, fry up some bacon. If I'm just doing small batches of bacon, I like to use my convection oven. The convection cooks them super fast and since its small, it uses less energy than my full oven. Plus, the almond buns are already taking up the oven 🙂 Next throw some fat in your cast iron skillet. Today, I'm using some left over duck fat from when I roasted a duck the other week. I rendered down the excess duck fat in a similar manner to the leaf lard I did last month. You want to fill the pan and really pan fry the egg. At this point, your almond buns should be done. In case you didn't know, these are quail eggs! Aren't they cute? Now crack 'em open and fry them! While the eggs are cooking I prepared the almond buns. I put 1/4th of a slice of cheddar cheese and half a slice of bacon on each one. Here's the finished batch! My wife doesn't like runny yolks so I cooked half of them over medium and the other half sunny side up. Yum!
A nutty conspiracy theory involving doctors gathering intelligence on gun-owning patients in advance of a mass gun-confiscation plan has cropped up again after being touted Wednesday by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).
Speaking with evangelical leader Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, the outspoken Paul claimed that the President was "going to use Obamacare apparently to have doctors informing on their patients to whether or not they have guns," and then store the information in "government databanks," reports Right Wing Watch.
Perkins said he, too, had read of this plan to have doctors acting as informants and had been "just flabbergasted."
Said Pratt:
[Obamacare] says that all of our medical records are available to be pawed through by bureaucrats somewhere in Washington, looking for a reason to disenfranchise gun owners, to say ‘oh you have a medical diagnosis that means you might be a danger to yourself or others so we're going to come and knock on the door for the BATF to take away your guns.
Radio personality Rush Limbaugh has apparently also joined the debate. On his show this week, Limbaugh said that wording in Obama's executive gun control package means "your doctor has essentially been deputized."
"Again, folks, this is pushing people's buttons on purpose," Limbaugh added. "This is gonna cause some people to snap. It might."
More credibly, Fox News wrote a long story Thursday that quoted National Rifle Association President David Keene as saying, "The idea that your doctor would ask you if you have firearms in your house as part of an examination of your health is repugnant."
Fox News noted, however, that much of the language that has been seized on is "in line with the policy of most states. All but a few allow mental health professionals to report information about patients they believe may become violent."
More than 26 years after Cambridge company Acorn and the BBC united to produce a computer to help educate the UK about the IT revolution some of the principal creators of the machine have gathered to remember its legacy. The casings may be slightly worn and the manuals a little dog-eared but a handful of BBC Micros were fired up at the Science Museum on Thursday as part of a Computer Conservation Society event to mark the legacy of the BBC Micro, know fondly as the Beeb. Four of the architects of the Beeb - Hermann Hauser, Steve Furber and Sophie Wilson who worked at Acorn and former BBC executive producer John Radcliffe - explain in their own words how the BBC Micro came to be created and the impact it had. STEVE FURBER In March 1981 we knew the BBC were interested in Acorn. Hermann Hauser told us that the BBC were coming five days before they arrived but we didn't even have a machine. But we had built several computers already so we were able to build a prototype for the BBC in five days, which I remember as being five days and four nights. There was a huge gap between what the BBC wanted and what we had planned to build. Their technical specification was basically a Z80 (processor) machine running CP/M (an operating sytem). What they contracted from Acorn was a 6502 (processor) machine running a proprietary operating system. We ultimately delivered that through the second processor which could be added to the BBC. We did get there in the end I think their key reason for wanting that specification was that there was a reasonably established market and they felt that with estimate of 12,000 machine sales they'd need to fit into an existing market. The reality to turned out completely at odds to that: BBC sales completely swamped that of Z80. More than 1.5 million were sold and the BBC became defacto the computer to build software for. The BBC Micro was released at the end of 1981 I don't think anyone at the outset anticipated the scale of the take up. Clearly once we were talking to the BBC we were aiming for the market they were planning to target their programmes at, which I think was somewhere in schools but also across to more enthusiastic homes. They were trying to move it out of the geek hobbyist sector because they saw this technology was going to affect everybody, particularly in business. We very much felt like pioneers; although we weren't quite the first. We knew that Apple had come out with the Apple II, which in many ways had a similar position in the US market to the one the Beeb had over here.They were a couple of years ahead of us. We had useful technical advantages over the Apple coming later; we ran the processor twice as fast and of course the Beeb had a lot of interfaces and probably proved to be the most expandable home computer there has ever been. We had done networking with Atom as an upgrade - which was satisfactory - and that technology wasn't built into every machine and this of course was 10 years before general population began to get involved with the world wide web. Technically the BBC Micro really caused Acorn to grow and was responsible for the development of the ARM processor, which followed very shortly after the BBC Micro. And the ARM is now the world's dominant architecture in the mobile embedded space, with absolutely unbelievable numbers. They have just past their 10,000 million point. The other legacy which keeps coming back to me is that a generation of people cut their computing teeth on the BBC Micro so I still meet people who say they did their first computing on the Beeb.
Steve Furber is Professor of Computer Engineering at Manchester University. HERMANN HAUSER We knew we were in a competition; there were six firms the BBC talked to and one of them was our arch-enemy Sinclair. We knew we had to work very hard to come up with a solution that was better than Sinclair. It was a wonderful rivalry: Sinclair and Acorn at the time were the two key competitors in the space and we egged each other on. There was a lot of local rivalry attached to it also. Steve Furber had been working on a machine we called the Proton, although this was really a machine that was still a vision more than any concrete design. It was quite a specific and worked out vision so when the BBC came with their requirements it was very ambitious as the specification was way above anything that was available at the time. It was a real stretch but a stretch that a young company enjoys. One very interesting complaint that I have from lots of computer science departments now is that people don't learn how to programme at school anymore. When they use PCs they don't programme them. When they used BBC Micro they programmed them themselves because it was so simple to write in BBC Basic. It was this generation that grew up programming BBC Basic that is partially responsible for the tremendous position we have in gaming. One of the great advantages of working with the BBC apart from the tremendous publicity, was the specification it gave to us, in terms of graphics, speed and networking. It's hard to say if we had specified a computer similar to the BBC Micro if we had not been approached by the BBC. The sad part of the story is that we missed a trick. We were so far ahead of the game - and I remember when Bill Gates visited us and I showed him an operating system that was much more developed than MS DOS at the time. We thought this was a clear advantage; not realising that the game had changed and the real advantage was standards. We would never have thought of giving our operating system away; it was our crown jewels. The same thing was true of our Econet, our networking system. We were way ahead with our networking. I remember Bill Gates marvelling at our networking because he didn't know about networking at the time. By keeping it proprietary we were fighting Intel and Microsoft on their home turf and there was no way that a little company from England could win that. In a way the surprise is how long Acorn managed to hold out. For 10 years we managed to beat Intel and Microsoft with a product that was much more powerful. Our products were more powerful than PCs for 10 years. Acorn became the Fairchild of Cambridge (chipmaker Fairchild spawned Silicon Valley in the US). There are about 100 companies which can trace their origins back to Acorn and some of them - ARM, CSR, Verata - are billion dollar companies which are bigger than Acorn could ever have hoped to be.

Advertisement SOPHIE WILSON Hermann had agreed with the BBC to show a prototype of a machine which at that stage was only in my head and we'd only discussed it. He sequentially rang up Steve (Furber) and myself and told each of us that the other had agreed to do it. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday we had to draw a circuit diagram of what we were going to build and find all the components and we wanted very specialised things like 4MHz Dram memory chips which didn't really exist at the time; I had read about it in a data book by Hitachi. We had things like Hitachi reps showing up with the four Drams that were in the country. We built early machines by hand but the BBC machine prototype was built in wire wrap. Hermann knew people in the Cambridge computer lab who wire-wrapped their equipment and we got a man called Ram Banarjee to come and help us. He was nick-named the fast gun in the West and was a demon at wiring things. [Wire-wrap is a simple way to prototype equipment]. We built the actual machine Wednesday night, and into Thursday evening and then of course it didn't work and we had to start debugging it. That debugging took all Thursday evening into Friday morning. I had to go home and get some sleep because I knew I would have to write some software for the machine. I came back 6am Friday morning by which time it was working. By the time the BBC people arrived at our offices we had an operating system and Basic interpreter running so that we could type on the screen and that stuff could come out. Before they left we had random graphs showing on the screen. We were fairly confident we had built something that would stay working during the demonstration. It was a rush to try and alter things to a state that we thought would be interesting to look at, to show them things they would understand. It was a massive arms race to build the machine into reality - it meant designing two logic arrays - what we call today system on a chip - one for video and the other for a cassette interface and get all of that ready. We also had to write the operating system and software to a spec that the BBC wanted. I think there were five of us in the offices writing the operating system for the machine on the day Charles and Diana got married. We had a little TV in the office and had a five minute break to watch her walk down the aisle and then we were back programming and soldering. We realised it was something special because before there were even production machines we were involved in technical help for the TV programmes. The very first TV programme that came out, Steve and I were there in the studio making sure the machines performed. Steve to this day says he remembers he had a soldering iron and I was programming busily to make the machines work. People wanted to know about computers. It was a unique moment in time when the public wanted to know how this stuff works and could be shown and taught how to programme.
Sophie Wilson is chief architect at Broadcom. JOHN RADCLIFFE It was very radical and unusual thinking; we did it because the BBC felt it was necessary. The BBC looked at it on all sides very cautiously. BBC Engineering and Engineering Research had a very positive view and the fact they thought it would be educational and beneficial to the BBC technically was a factor which weighed with top management. We were in the business of developing computer literacy. We had 10 television programmes but people don't learn very much from programmes. There's nothing like getting your hands on a machine to find out what it can and can't do, what it consists of. We had this notion that we needed a computer associated with the project, that we could do demonstrations in the studio and that people could go out and buy it and use it in the home. In order to do that we had to have a standard; a software standard that ran right through the programmes and that standard was BBC Basic. That was the underlying rationale of having the Micro. Seven companies were identified by the Department for Trade and Industry as being possible candidates. We wrote to them all with our specification and six bids. We looked at the bids very carefully, with BBC engineers and consultants from outside and we decided that Acorn was the best offer. We were surprised by the reaction. We had audiences between 500,000 and 1.2 million late night on BBC One. We managed to reach 16% of the adult population with one programme or another; so our reach was very wide. We had a basic book, The Computer Book, following the series and 80,000 copies were sold in half a year; we had a course to learn BBC Basic in 30 hours and 120,000 copies were sold. The penetration of the project into the population was very great. This wasn't just because of our genius; it was because it was timely. There was enormous curiosity about the subject, about computing.

Uma matéria surpreendente e inesperada da IstoÉ traz declarações demolidoras do empresário Davincci Lourenço de Almeida. Além de afirmar que entregou pessoalmente malas de dinheiro ao ex-presidente Lula, Davincci afirma que a morte de seu ex-sócio Fernando de Arruda Botelho há cinco anos atrás não foi acidente, mas sim uma trama para encobrir um esquema de corrupção na Petrobras. A corajosa reportagem é assinada por Sérgio Pardellas e Germano Oliveira
Não dá para afirmar de imediato de que tudo o que foi relatado por Davincci tenha de fato acontecido, mas a verossimilhança com os crimes praticados na Petrobras e com o assassinato de Celso Daniel chamam a atenção. O assassinato do prefeito também tinha por finalidade encobrir um esquema criminoso operado pelo Partido dos Trabalhadores em Santo André. O prefeito também foi morto em circunstâncias estranhas e ainda não esclarecidas. Sua morte ainda é motivo de discussão e medo, já que todas as oito testemunhas chave foram assassinadas. Não é sem razão que esta morte ainda assombra o petismo.
O detalhe bizarro no caso de Celso Daniel é que a Operação Lava Jato descobriu que o Grupo Schahin obteve o contrato do navio-sonda Vitória 10.000 de maneira fraudulenta para pagar uma dívida feita pelo pecuarista José Carlos Bumlai junto ao banco do grupo – divida feita para que o PT pagasse o chantagista Ronan Maria Pinto, que ameaçava contar a Justiça qual seria o envolvimento de Lula com a trama homicida. Ronan foi preso na Operação Carbono 14. Bumlai, que já estava preso, simplesmente confessou ao juiz Sérgio Moro que fez o empréstimo para pagar uma divida do PT. Foi aí que o PT inventou a dupla-pedalada criminosa: sem dinheiro para saldar a dívida feita por Bumlai, o PT pagou o banqueiro Salim Shachin com um contrato. Para pagar um empréstimo de R$ 60 milhões, Lula concedeu aos Schahin um contrato de R$ 1,5 Bilhão. A concessão sem licitação reforça a suspeita: o PT queria muito esconder o motivo do empréstimo.
Agora temos esta fabulosa história contada por Davincci Loureço sobre as malas de dinheiro e sobre a corrupção na Petrobras. Se a justiça confirmar essas acusações, ficará provado que a trajetória do PT não é feita apenas de lama, mas também de sangue. Ao fim, a matéria da IstoÉ pode ser a bala de prata que aniquilará Lula e sua organização criminosa.
This is a quick response to Ben's tweet from this week:
This does not seem ok: http://t.co/DGK6CteRPK Emperor's New Clothes Effect™ in full force again. — Ben Howdle (@benhowdle) December 1, 2014
Edit: Ben seems to have deleted the tweet since this was published — I'm not sure why.
His issue is the mix of logic and template. We've all heard it: your templates should exist in their own files, referenced by some kind of view. The logic is defined somewhere else.
Separating the two is meant to lead to more simple templates, a single place to find logic, maintainabile code and perhaps even code reuse.
Ben's view is that embedding the template in the React component loses those desirable properties. I hope I'm not putting word in his mouth.
You've probably guessed that I disagree.
View logic is tied to a component (or application's) state — good examples are toggling attributes, selectively including parts of the template, and reusing other templates or whole components. When the connection between the presentation and related logic isn't intuitive or obvious, split-brain maintainability problems occur because the presentation changes incurred by a logical change are not clear. This leads to bugs.
There are always going to be pieces of logic that are dedicated to presentation, which meansthey are inextricably tied to the template itself. In the traditional model they are needlessly kept apart, and separating them actually complicates maintenance.
The traditional pattern also allows reuse of a template without reuse of associated logic, leading to a combinatorial problem where changes made for one use of the template can accidentally (and negatively) affect other uses — again without an explicit connection between the two.
My position is that logic dedicated solely to presentation should be physically, line-of-code close to its use in a template because they are in fact the same concern. Changes in logic are immediately linked to changes in presentation due to proximity and so the implications of a change are intuitively clear.
In the literature, this property is called cohesion — the separate-template approach has low cohesion; the alternative has high cohesion, and is more desirable for it.
React's way of doing things has high cohesion and a good measure of intuitive maintainability. I like it.
When China gained control of Hong Kong in 1997, it represented an economically significant addition to the territory under Beijing's control. Mainland China had almost 200 times as many people as Hong Kong, yet they did not even produce six times as much stuff. In the 17 years since the handover, though, the Chinese economy has grown a lot faster than Hong Kong's economy has:
In 1997, Hong Kong's economy was more than 18 percent the size of the economy of the mainland. Today, the figure is down to three percent. Mainland China produces 30 times as many goods and services as does Hong Kong.
On a per capita basis, Hong Kong is still dramatically wealthier than the mainland. Last year, Hong Kong produced $38,000 per resident, compared to $6,800 on the mainland. But the mainland is narrowing that gap pretty quickly.
Does this changing economic picture have an effect on the current standoff in Hong Kong? The authorities in Beijing have always viewed the takeover of Hong Kong more in political terms than economic ones. But the spectacular growth of the Chinese government no doubt bolsters their confidence in the system that prevails on the mainland, which combines a market economy with political repression.
The Chinese government's confidence has grown along with its economy. That could make it a bit more willing to endure international scrutiny and criticism of that system, including when it comes to Hong Kong and the protesters' demands for greater democracy.
The European economy is saving around 114 billion euro per year by using open source software solutions. Apart from direct costs savings, other benefits of open source result in reduced project failure and lower costs for code maintenance. Reinvestment of these savings leads to an increase in productivity and efficiency worth at least 342 billion euro a year, according to estimates published by open source researcher Carlo Daffara. "Decidedly not a marginal contribution to the European economy."
Daffara is a researcher in the field of IT economics. He focusses on collaborative development models. In the past fifteen years he was also involved in European Commission research projects involving open source.
To assess the value of the use of open source, Daffara combines data from code reuse surveys with macroeconomic esimates. Quoting several sources, he estimates that about 35 per cent of the software used in the past five years is directly or indirectly derived from open source. To translate this into savings, the researcher draws on estimates for the total value of the IT sector. Industry groups and analysts estimate this to be between 374 billion and 399 billion euro.
To this Daffara adds estimates on costs saved because using open source generally has a positive impacts on projects success rates. He also points to research showing that "code that is reused is substantially better in terms of quality". Such software also improves faster and its maintenance efforts are substantially lower, he writes. Based on earlier research models, the costs for reused code is about three-fifths that of traditional code.
"Especially important is the effect of the reinvestments of these savings into IT itself", the researcher continues. Companies that use a lot of open sources are more productive and efficient, he finds. The researcher suspects that there is a correlation between the use of open source software and the ability to attract customers of a relatively larger scale. The result is a long term increase in productivity and efficiency, of at least 342 billion euro per year.
Daffara's estimates of the contribution of open source software to the European economy were published by the OpenForum Acadamy, a think-tank. His paper is part of the proceedings of the first OFA conference, which took place in Brussels on 24 September. The book can be downloaded for free.

Let us just consider some facts:
1. Labor regulation in Europe has resulted in a two-class society. Some workers have the privilege of a permanent contract, and their risk of redundancy is low, meanwhile other workers are living off zero-hours contracts, or 6-month contracts which are rolled-over at most 1 month before their termination. It is my hypothesis that with every month there is an increase in the percentage of European workers who are not creditworthy enough to be granted a credit card. I do not have the figures, but a PhD student should be researching this subject.
2. Lower-paid State employees in Europe are increasingly privileged over higher-paid private sector employees. Most State employees are given permanent contracts and are not expected to work overtime, meanwhile in the private sector, employees are increasingly only given term contracts, and everyone is expected to work 10-hour days. Again, this is an issue that needs to be studied. It would be interesting to know the difference in suicide rates between State employees and private sector employees, and between workers with permanent contracts and workers with term contracts which are subject to being rolled-over.
3. There is massive labor regulation arbitrage going on across Europe. Multinationals (e.g. IBM) sack highly experienced consultants and executives in those countries where it is easiest (Switzerland, UK, Ireland), and replace the sacked consultants and executives with transfers from those countries where it is more difficult to sack employees (France, Italy, Spain, Germany). Again, this is an issue that is not being studied, but it is happening.
3. The 1% v.s 99% wealth inequality is not a myth, but it is far more than 1% who are doing quite nicely in what amounts to nothing less than the most severe Europe economic recession since the 1930s. Anyone who has a State job is doing well, likewise anyone who has a permanent contract is doing well, plus many pensioners are doing well. And the wealthy are doing exceedingly well: property and stock prices are at all-time highs. And the partners, and children (often a single child), of those who are doing well are themselves doing well. So it could be anything up to 50% of the population who are doing well. And all the members of all parliaments, national and European, are doing exceptionally well.
4. Increasingly in Europe there are huge inequalities opening up between, on the one hand, households where both partners are in precarious work situations, and, on the other hand, households where both partners have permanent contracts. This kind of household inequality needs to be studied in depth.
Conclusion: All these inequalities with regard to labour contracts must be addressed head-on. What is needed is the economic equivalent of comparative literature. In other words, a discipline that studies the comparative situations of different kinds of workers (EU civil servants vs. EU member-State civil servants vs. private-sector workers), and the increasingly complex private-sector arbitrages (fiscal, labour, pension, insurance) between EU member-countries. Radical changes need to be made. Too many workers have too few labour rights, and those workers with generous labour rights (e.g. State employees with permanent contracts) must transfer some of their rights to those with no labour rights. The fight has to be as much between different labour categories, and not just between capital and labour.
IMPORTANT UPDATE: PLEASE UPDATE TO THIS VERSIONGetting a new perk can be great, until you realize you "have to" put it in a certain perk like Gun Nut or Sharpshooter in order to stay viable. So many people "have to" get Charisma of 5 in order to get local leader, because settlements are zero fun without provisioners. Automatic Boring Perks frees you from that tedium by giving you certain perks as you level up! You will get each perk at the earliest level you could aquire it. The perks are: Armorer, Basher, Big Leagues, Blacksmith, Commando, Demolition Expert, Gun Nut, Gunslinger, Heavy Gunner, Iron Fist, Local Leader, Rifleman, and Science.I highly recommend a difficulty rebalancer if you're using this mod. While this mod gives you 55 perks over 49 levels, it's effectively 15-ish perks, since few folks will use all of the perks, unless you're somehow both using punches and missile launchers in the same character. But with this mod, it's now an option without crippling your other abilities!This IS compatible with existing savegames.Groveling appology: Version 1.0 broke save games. I am so sorry. What happened was some vestigial code from Skyrim had some side-effects. If you add the Gunslinger perk, level 1, it will give you rank 1 of that perk. If you add it again, it gives you rank 2, up to 255 ranks. There is no data for ranks 2-255, so the perk would stop working. The perk chart only checks if you have the perk, not what rank. Version 2.0 starts by removing all the perks it touched (thus all ranks of it), and then adding the perks back. Now when it goes to add a perk, it checks to see if you already have it, and thus won't be adding the same perk multiple times, creating the "wrong rank" issue. I am so sorry, it's fixed now, my bad.Version 2.1: Update that should smooth when someone applies this mod to a higher level savegame. Before it was removing all the relevant perks on load, and then adding them back on levelup. Now it will do both on load, and the adding on level-up. Only update if applying this to an existing save game.Version 2.0: Oh my gosh I screwed up so bad. I didn't realize Fallout 4 still had "ranks" of perks like Skyrim (vestigial code) so when you add the same perk more than once, it "breaks" the perk because there's no data for "rank 2" of Gunslinger level 1. The perk chart would show you had the perk, but you'd get no benefit. This has been fixed. I am so sorry. Please update.Version 1.1: Totally my bad, I uploaded the .esp and not the .ba2 and .esp combined, so it was missing all the scripts. It should now be 100% functional! A big thanks to Flenarn from Project Cascadia for the helping me to realize just how badly I messed up when saving my project!Version 1: Optimize the scripting of the perk adding; now only runs on level-up instead of constantly, remove all debug messages.Version 0.5: Automate adding the perksVersion 0.1: Series of BAT files as proof of concept

The move by the Centre would legitimise government imposed internet blackouts.
In a move that would legitimise government imposed internet and telecom blackouts in the country, the Ministry of Communications has issued new rules under the Telegraph Act on August 7 without any public consultation.
According to the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017, designated officers of state governments or of the Centre of Joint Secretary rank (or above) can order police officers of SP rank or above to send the order to designated officers of the service provider, reports Bar and Bench.
Medianama reports that according to these rules, the Union Home Secretary can order the State Home Secretary to enforce a shutdown, if it is imposed by the Centre.
However, in case of “unavoidable circumstances” officers (of Joint Secretary rank or above) designated by the Home Ministry can pass such orders but will have to be reviewed by the Union Home Secretary within 24 hours.
The MN report further says that in case of a shutdown imposed by the state government, the order has to be issued by the Secretary in-charge of the Home Department with the exception of “unavoidable circumstances” where a Joint Secretary level officer authorised by the State Home Secretary can issue orders. Such an order will again face the scrutiny of the State Home Secretary within 24 hours.
The new rules also mandate that once an order is issued it has to be sent to the Review Committee which shall meet within the next five working days.
For the state, Review Committees will comprise of the Law Secretary, Secretary to the state government and the Home Secretary, while the Chief Secretary will be the Chairman.
For the Centre, the Review Committee will be made up of the Cabinet Secretary, Secretary to the Government of India In-charge, Legal Affairs; Secretary to the Government, Department of Telecommunications.
However, the Review Committee is not empowered to take any punitive action in case the suspension orders were issued without following the rules.
According to Internetshutdowns.in, India has experienced a total of 42 internet shutdowns in 2017 so far.
Under the current practice, a district magistrate or any other executive magistrate passes an order directing a blackout after the Supreme Court in 2016 upheld the districts and states' right to ban mobile Internet services to maintain law and order.
The United Nation High Commissioner for Human Rights has observed that internet shutdowns violate freedom of expression and act as collective punishment in context of the internet blackouts in Kashmir.
“The internet and telecommunications bans have the character of collective punishment (and) fail to meet the standards required under international human rights law to limit freedom of expression. Denying such access disrupts the free exchange of ideas and the ability of individuals to connect with one another and associate peacefully on matters of shared concern,” UN High Commissioner for Human Rights “The internet and telecommunications bans have the character of collective punishment (and) fail to meet the standards required under international human rights law to limit freedom of expression. Denying such access disrupts the free exchange of ideas and the ability of individuals to connect with one another and associate peacefully on matters of shared concern,” UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said in May, 2017.

It seems like it was just yesterday when we had an "imperialist warmonger" in the White House who was going to be replaced by a peace-loving Democrat who promised "hope" and "change" instead. It's funny how that worked out, isn't it? We still have troops in Iraq, we've escalated the war in Afghanistan, and now we're bombing everything that moves in Libya. Yet, the same liberals who were protesting in the streets and calling George Bush a war criminal have mostly been meek and quiet about the fact that the President they supported has been following in George Bush's footsteps.
So, the obvious question is, “Did you lefties believe ANY of the crap you were spewing about the war on terrorism before Obama got into office?” If so, maybe you could answer a few questions prompted by the things liberals were saying during the Bush years.
1) Isn't this a rush to war? There were 17 UN resolutions regarding Iraq, Bush talked about going to war for a full year before we actually invaded, and he received Congressional approval first. After all that, liberals STILL shouted that it was a "rush to war." Meanwhile, Obama decided to bomb Libya in between making his Final Four picks and planning out a vacation to Brazil, probably because Hillary yelled at him. How about applying the same standards to Obama that you applied to Bush?
2) Is Obama invading Libya because Gaddafi insulted him?
We fear that Obama will feel that, because he is black with an inferiority complex, this will make him behave worse than the whites. This will be a tragedy. We tell him to be proud of himself as a black and feel that all Africa is behind him because if he sticks to this inferiority complex he will have a worse foreign policy than the whites had in the past.
Obama doesn't have much use for anyone who criticizes him. Even his spiritual mentor Jeremiah Wright learned all about what the underside of a bus looks like after he dared to criticize Obama. Is that Obama's real motivation? Hmmmmmmm, liberals?
3) Is this a war for oil? What was it liberals kept saying over and over about Iraq? Oh yeah, it was "No blood for oil!" What was the rationale for claiming the war in Iraq was about oil? Iraq had oil; we were going to war there; so obviously it just MUST be about oil. That was it. So, Libya has oil and unlike Hussein, Gaddafi has been cooperative of late; so there's no compelling reason for America to invade....except perhaps, to safeguard all that Texas T. flowing beneath the sand. So, when do we have liberals in the streets shouting "No blood for oil?"
Can't you just see it? The Communist Party, Code Pink, the black bloc, and the free Mumia wackjobs all joining together with the Tea Party to protest Obama. Wouldn't that be fun? I mean personally, I've been waiting for years to wear a "No Blood For Oil" sign while I carry around a giant puppet head. Someone calls the commies and union members who organize all these hippie shindigs for the Left and let's do this thing!
5) Shouldn't we have tried to talk it out with Gaddafi instead? I thought that the Muslim world loves and respects America since Barack Obama became President? So, why not try to talk it out with Gaddafi? Perhaps Obama should have been humble, realized he didn't have all the answers, and then he could have had a conversation with Gaddafi instead of threatening him? Maybe he should have considered the possibility that Libya's culture is a little different than ours. Had he perhaps met with Gaddafi and bowed to him to show his respect, this could have probably been worked out without violence. Oh, why, why must we be so arrogant and so ignorant of other nations' rich cultural traditions, which in Libya apparently consist of murdering everyone who opposes you?
You know what they say, “An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind!” We drop bombs on them, they get angry, and next thing you know, they turn into terrorists to get us back! That was what we heard from the Left over and over during the Bush years, wasn't it? That we were creating terrorists?
That's why liberals like Richard Gere suggested brilliant strategies like this to deal with Al-Qaeda:
In a situation like this, of course you identify with everyone who's suffering. (But we must also think about) the terrorists who are creating such horrible future lives for themselves because of the negativity of this karma. It's all of our jobs to keep our minds as expansive as possible. If you can see (the terrorists) as a relative who's dangerously sick and we have to give them medicine, and the medicine is love and compassion. There's nothing better.
Maybe instead of bombing Libya, Obama needs to engage in a little more love and compassion by hugging Gaddafi into submission!
7) Isn't Barack Obama a chickenhawk? Barack Obama has never served in the military; yet he just decided to engage in a "war of choice" in Libya. Even if you chalk up Iraq and Afghanistan to Obama cleaning up after Bush, this one is all on him. If American soliders die, it's because Obama chose to put them in harm's way. If Libyan civilians are killed by American weapons, it's because Barack Obama gave the order to attack. So, can we all agree that Barack Obama is a squawking, yellow bellied chickenhawk?
The downtown site that is home to the World's Biggest Bookstore is being sold to a developer, and the bookstore will close in February. “We're acquiring it soon. We don't have any finalized plans or intentions with the property,” said Brian Brown, vice-president of Lifetime Developments, the firm behind Liberty Market Lofts, WaterParkCity and the Four Seasons Hotel.

Property owner David Cole, son of Cole Books founder Jack Cole, who died in 1997, said the sale is pending. He said the story that his father was adamant that the site would always house a bookstore is an urban legend. “I was with my dad the day he bought it in 1979. My dad would have wanted what was best for his family,” said Cole. The store at 20 Edward St., a short block from the Eaton Centre, opened in 1980 and was a tourist attraction for many years. A former bowling alley, the space is a somewhat awkward 64,000 square feet over three levels, including an alcove on the second floor. It's not actually the world's biggest bookstore. There is a Barnes & Noble in New York City that is more than twice as large. But it still houses a vast number of books, including a wall of Shakespeare, a wall of poetry and another dedicated to Manga. It has long rows of fiction, including a Star Wars section. And, like Sam the Record Man, which closed in 2007, and Honest Ed's, which has been sold to a Vancouver developer, the World's Biggest Bookstore was a brash, quirky retailer that for a long time anchored Toronto's retail landscape.
Drew McGowen, vice-president of real estate and development for Indigo Books & Music Inc., said the store was at the end of a lease and the company could not afford the new rent. Indigo had been leasing the site for about $1.5 million a year, or $24 per square foot.

Indigo is also closing the Runnymede Chapters, built in a former theatre that it preserved and restored at great cost. A Shoppers Drug Mart will take over that location, Bloor St. W. near Runnymede Rd. McGowen said the company is rebalancing its real estate portfolio. “You have to look at your portfolio on an ongoing basis, and we have a very large store at the Eaton Centre,” he said. “This isn't us in a mode of shutting down stores. We will be going back out in the market and looking for some net new stores,” said McGowen. The World's Biggest Bookstore location must be vacated by April 30. It will close to the public in mid-February. The store employs about 43 people, many of them long-serving and deeply knowledgeable about books. Indigo will try to find work for them within the existing store network, but it won't be possible to accommodate all of them, said McGowen. Jack Cole dropped out of high school to work in a bookstore in the 1930s, according to his obituary. He and his brother Carl went into the book business together. After the war, they hit on the idea of publishing study aids. The yellow-and-black striped Coles Notes — easy guides to subjects ranging from Shakespeare's plays to genetics — went on to become the world's best-selling study guides. Indigo came to own Coles after a long series of mergers and acquisitions in the book industry. “That's really sad, I can't believe it,” said bookstore owner Ben McNally, of McNally Books on Bay St., when he learned the World's Biggest will close. McNally opened his store just before the economic turmoil of 2008. “Our biggest problem is Amazon,” McNally said, referring to all bookstores. “My business is pretty good because so many bookstores are going out of business. And I work like a maniac.”
“Roll Over Rover ” Rick Santorum responded on WOR radio's Steve Malzberg Right Wingnut Central hate talk radio show to turn down the request by Dan Savage for a hate fuck that he made of Santorum on Friday's Real Time with Bill Maher and to do some typical right wing whining and playing the victim card because some of us are now standing up and getting in their faces and giving back the abuse they have given us for so long.
“Whether it's Rick Santorum or Michele Bachmann, it's the Left making fun of someone who believes in the values that built America. It believes in traditional marriage. How outrageous. How bigoted. How hateful that you actually believe that, that, you know, raising children and, and, and families with mothers and fathers is something to be encouraged. That you're, that, that, just because you hold those opinions, you are subject to the worst form of, of, of, of vulgarity on the internet, on television, and everywhere else, and they get away with, not only do they get away with the mainstream media, but they are applauded by the mainstream media. They are made, they are celebrated by, as you mentioned, in New York, by taking on these, these people who believe in these outmoded virtues, and, the bottom line is I stand and I wear it as a badge of honor that someone as vulgar and as, and as disgusting and as hate-filled as Dan Savage sees me as public enemy number one. To me, that tells me I must be doing something right.

ANCA Calls Out Weak Administration Response to Foreign Attack on American Freedoms
WASHINGTON—Metropolitan Washington D.C. police made two arrests in the case of the May 16 beatings of peaceful protesters, but stopped short of leveling charges against the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's security detail that led the brutal attack, reported the Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA).
According to The Daily Caller's Chuck Ross, Turkish Americans Eyup Yildirim, an owner of a construction company in New Jersey, is charged with assault with significant bodily injury and aggravated assault while Sinan Narin, a Virginia resident faces an aggravated assault charge.
“We remain deeply troubled—nearly a month after this unprovoked assault by a foreign government on peaceful U.S. protesters—over the lack of criminal charges against Erdoğan's security detail and the failure of the Trump Administration to demand that Ankara waive its claims to immunity for all those involved in this assault on our American freedoms,” said ANCA Executive Director Aram Hamparian.
“These two arrests are a good start, but this is about far more than crime enforcement. It's about our U.S. government standing up against foreign attempts to silence dissent by American citizens. In light of the major media attention devoted to this outrage and given the intense Congressional concern about its consequences – it is unacceptable that the White House and State Department have demonstrated such weakness, adopting, basically, a business-as-usual approach in the face of a brazen, angry, and arrogant foreign attack on peaceful protesters on American soil,” concluded Hamparian.
Hamparian was videotaping live at the scene of the May 16 attack, which took place in front of the Turkish Ambassador's residence where President Erdoğan was scheduled to have a closed-door meeting with representatives of The Atlantic Council, a leading think tank in Washington, D.C., which receives funding from Turkey. Hamparian's video showed pro-Erdogan forces crossing a police line and beating peaceful protesters—elderly men and several women—who were on the ground bleeding during most of the attack.
Hamparian testified before a May 25th Foreign Affairs Subcommittee hearing on this matter. Joining him at the hearing were Ms. Lusik Usoyan, Founder and President of the Ezidi Relief Fund; Mr. Murat Yusa, a local businessman and protest organizer; and Ms. Ruth Wedgwood, Edward B. Burling Professor of International Law and Diplomacy, at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. Usoyan and Yusa were victims of the brutal assault on May 16th by President Erdoğan's bodyguards.
On June 6, with a vote of 397 to 0, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously condemned Turkey in response to the attacks, taking a powerful stand against Ankara's attempts to export its violence and intolerance to America's shores. H.Res.354, spearheaded by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.), Ranking Democrat Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), has received the public backing of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). A companion measure has been introduced in the Senate by Senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.).
The House vote follows broad-based Congressional outrage expressed by over 100 Senate and House members through public statements, social media, and a series of Congressional letters.
Senate and House members have also raised concerns about the recently announced $1.2 million sale of semi-automatic guns slated for use by Turkish President Erdognan's security detail, many of whom participated in the May 16 attacks. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Democrat Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ed Royce have already objected to the sale.
Congressional Armenian Caucus Co-Chairs Dave Trott (R-Mich.) and Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) are urging colleagues to co-sign a letter to Secretary Tillerson to block the gun sale to Turkey. To contact legislators to cosign the letter, visit: anca.org/NoGunsForTurkey
ANCA live footage of the attack served as source video for CNN, AP, The Washington Post, The Daily Caller and other major media, transforming the violent incident into a global spotlight on Erdoğan's attempt to export his intolerance and aggression to American shores.
The Sunday, June 4 edition of The New York Times featured a two-page center-spread investigative report on the May 16th attack, with online version of the coverage translated to Turkish and shared widely on social media. The report identified Yildirim and Narin as having participated in the attacks.
The New York Times coverage is available here:

The ANCA is cited by The New York Times as a source for this report.
The May 16 protest in front of the Turkish Ambassador's residence was a continuation of a demonstration held earlier in the day in front of the White House, co-hosted by the ANCA. As President Trump met with President Erdoğan. Human rights and religious rights groups were joined by representatives of the Kurdish, Yezidi, and Armenian communities to call attention to the Erdoğan regime's escalating repression against free press, the Kurdish and other ethnic communities, as well as Turkey's ongoing obstruction of justice for the Armenian Genocide.

— Authorities on Friday added more charges to the three teens accused of throwing rocks off an overpass on Interstate 95 in Cumberland County after two more drivers came forward.
Bobby Shane Stone, 17, Javier Prieto Jr., 18, and Alex Alvarado, 18, were arrested on Feb. 1 and charged with five felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill and five counts of damage to personal property. The Cumberland County Sheriff's office tacked on two additional counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill and damage to property.
The trio were being held in the Cumberland County Jail on a $250,000 bond, but the sheriff's office increased their bonds to $350,000 after Jerry Crawley, of Victoria, Virginia and Bill Patterson Trucking, of Clayton, N.C., reported having their trucks damaged by objects being thrown from the overpass.
Officials said they located Stone coming out under the Sherrill Baggett Road overpass at mile marker 65 on I-95. He was the driver of a white BMW parked near the bridge. Police said they also located Prieto and Alvarado on the south side of the bridge.
Authorities said five victims reported damaged vehicles: Jerry Harrison of Ontana, S.C., had damage to the hood and windshield of his 2000 Freightliner truck, William Myers of Columbia, S.C., had damage to the windshield of his 2007 Freightliner truck, Ismael Quinero of Sunrise, Fla., had damage to his 1995 International truck—as well to the 2006 Chrysler 300 he was hauling—Billy Lee of Fayetteville had damage to the sunroof and top of his 2003 Chevrolet Impala, and Frank Pope of Alexandria, Va., reported damage to the grill and roof of his 2015 Freightliner truck.
From the sudden jump scares, grotesque monsters, unsettling atmosphere and a compelling story, the horror video game genre holds a special place in most of our hearts. The genre, in my personal opinion, really got its big break in the 1990s with video game titles like Silent Hill making their appearance.
Throughout the years the horror genre has evolved, new incredible video games have come out to market as newer consoles launched to the masses around the world. Now that we're in the latest generation of consoles and 2015 is upon us, here are some worthy horror video game titles you'll want to keep a close eye on for their upcoming release dates.
Since this is a list, we're sure there are some video games we may be missing, have a title worth checking out that is set to release in 2015, simply let us know in the comment section down below!
Call of Cthulhu
Developers: Frogwares Studio
Publisher: Focus Home Interactive
Platforms: Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC
Call of Cthulhu has made its rounds for quite a few years now. In fact it was first brought out to the world all the way back in 1928 by author H.P. Lovecraft through a short story featured in Weird Tales. Unfortunately, news is still a bit scarce on the video game title though the concept images released prove to carry a very dark and mysterious atmosphere. This will be the latest Call of Cthulhu video game iteration released since Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth, a video game that was well received by critics but wasn't a major hit in market.
There's a subtlety to Ethan Happ's game that masks the ruthless efficiency of Wisconsin's sophomore center. To watch Happ is to see a series of sleight of hand tricks in real time, ball fakes and spin moves and hook shots that would have looked more appropriate decades ago.
Happ feels like a throwback trapped in the future. He's a big man who can do everything other than shoot outside of 5 feet, yet one who gets it done with a style that resembles few contemporaries. He doesn't have Lonzo Ball's panache, Miles Bridges' explosion or Malik Monk's flamethrower shooting stroke, but his game is every bit as entertaining.
As a former three-star recruit, Happ isn't just Wisconsin's latest diamond in the rough. He's also college basketball's most underappreciated star.
Happ wasn't even the headliner on his own team coming into the season. Nigel Hayes was the Badger was who named Big Ten Player of the Year in the preseason and Bronson Koenig was the senior point guard with Final Four experience and an NCAA tournament buzzer-beater on his resume. Along the way, Happ has emerged as the best player on a Wisconsin team in poll position to win the conference and go on another long run in March.
Happ has been as productive as any player in college basketball this year. He's shooting 61.8 percent from the floor, he's top-20 in the country in rebounding percentage and has the highest assist rate (23.9 percent) of any center in D1. His advanced numbers are even more impressive.
Happ is leading college basketball in BPM (box score plus/minus) at 18.2, which is 2.2 points better than No. 2 (Virginia's Isaiah Wilkins). He's also tops in the country in wins shares per 40 minutes and PER at 35.3.
So much of Happ's value comes through on the defensive end. He's No. 11 in the country in steal rate, first in defense rating and third in defensive win shares. If the advanced stats aren't convincing you, maybe Jay Bilas will:
Wisconsin's Ethan Happ is the best defender I've seen all season. To this point, he's the leader for National Defensive Player of the Year. — Jay Bilas (@JayBilas) February 6, 2017
Happ's ability to rack up steals is incredibly rare for a center. He's the only player in the top 70 of the steal rate rankings taller than 6'7. He owes so much of it to an incredible quickness that allows him to get out into the passing lanes and intercept the ball.
Watch how he baits the opposing guard into throwing the pass to one shoulder before racing around and snatching it on the other end:
ICYMI: Ethan Happ, as he does, did it all on this @BadgerMBB highlight. https://t.co/cWSp2feM2r — Wisconsin On BTN (@WisconsinOnBTN) February 5, 2017
He's also a master at pushing the ball coast-to-coast in transition and using his body as a shield to finish once he gets to the rim.
Wisconsin has always had a reputation for uncovering hidden gems, with players like Jordan Taylor and Alando Tucker going from unheralded recruits to college stars. The best example is Frank Kaminsky, who turned into the national player of the year and powered two Final Four runs as a former three-star recruit. Happ is quickly joining that lineage.
Growing up in small town Milan, Ill. near the Quad Cities, Happ was just 5'9 at the start of eighth grade, 6'3 during his freshman season and a 6'7 small forward when he signed with Wisconsin as a sophomore. At the time, Happ's only other offers were from UW-Milwaukee and UW-Green Bay.
Happ didn't play on one of the three major shoe company grassroots circuits, which made recognition hard to come by. He turned himself into a two-time all-state player in Illinois by the end of his high school career and then had a standout performance playing for the United States at the Albert Schweitzer tournament in Germany. By then, Wisconsin fans thought they had found the Badgers' next sleeper.
Bo Ryan needed more convincing. With a veteran team returning off a Final Four run the previous season, Happ redshirted. He spent every day going against Kaminsky, Hayes and Sam Dekker in practice. That experience was parlayed into a Big Ten Freshman of the Year campaign when he made his college debut last season.
He's taken another major jump this season as a redshirt sophomore. He's leading the Badgers in points, rebounds, steals and blocks per game and he's a close second in assists. He's also one of the most efficient scorers in the country.
Happ's only real weakness is his lack of shooting range. He has not attempted a three-pointer in his college career and is only a 50.5 percent foul shooter. Combine that with a somewhat undersized frame for a center at 6'10, 230 pounds, and NBA scouts haven't come calling just yet. If that means Wisconsin gets two more seasons of Happ after this one, Badger fans will be perfectly OK with it.
Wisconsin has at least reached the Sweet 16 in five of the last six years, and it has the roster to do it again this season with Happ raising his game to a new level. You might not think of Happ as one of the best players in the country, but the numbers definitively prove otherwise.
If you've wondered what's behind the doors at one of Baltimore's museums, but never went in to find out, here's an incentive. This weekend, many of them will offer free admission.
It's called “Museum Day Live.”
Other cities have been doing it for years, and now, Baltimore is joining in.
Culture and curiosity come together in museums across Baltimore.
From the locomotives at the B&O Railroad Museum, to the Star-Spangled Banner Flag House, these pieces of history are more accessible than ever this weekend.
“Please come join us and celebrate our museums, and recognize what great, great institutions they are in our city,” said Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh.
City institutions are teaming up with Smithsonian Magazine to bring “Museum Day Live.”
The national initiative was started 13 years ago, and allows museums to open their doors to those who download branded tickets.
On a typical day, the adult admission to some museums is as little as $10, but during the event, you can walk in for free.
“I look at this event as an opportunity to throw out the welcome mat and say hello to a world of new people that might otherwise not have visited us,” said B&O Museum Director Courtney Wilson.
On Saturday, the following museums will waive admission: the B&O, Lithuanian, Industry, Streetcar, Evergreen, Homewood, and Irish Rail Road Workers, Maryland Historical Society, Dentistry, Reginald F. Lewis, Star-Spangled Banner Flag House, and the Baltimore Museum of Art.

Local school officials are monitoring mumps outbreaks in neighboring Arkansas and Texas after being notified of the situation by the state Office of Public Health, according to a story in today's Daily Advertiser.The daily reports that although no outbreaks have been reported in Louisiana, up to 1,800 people — most of them children whose parents chose not to have them vaccinated — have been infected in Arkansas. A pair of smaller outbreaks are reported in Texas.“These outbreaks of mumps in neighboring states should serve as a reminder for families of unimmunized children to consider vaccinating their children,” LPSS said in a statement. “In the case of a local outbreak of mumps, the OPH and the Lafayette Parish School System may exclude non-vaccinated, exposed individuals from attending school.”Herd immunity.Read more here
Man alone is not responsible for climate change and the world has far bigger problems than “global warming,” said former French President Nicolas Sarkozy.
“Climate has been changing for four billion years,” Sarkozy, who's running for president again, told business leaders at the Institut de l'enterprise on Wednesday. “Sahara has become a desert, it isn't because of industry.”
“You need to be as arrogant as men are to believe we changed the climate.”
The former president seems to have changed his mind; in 2007 he warned that “we cannot ignore the climate challenge,” but despite that statement, French media reported that he rarely discussed “global warming” while president.
This is the first time he was openly skeptical about “man-made climate change.”
Interestingly, Sarkozy is running again for president amid the extreme backlash against President François Hollande for calling on France to embrace Islam.
Sarkozy's statement shows the influence Donald Trump already has over world politics; Trump, a skeptic himself, is making it safe for other political candidates to openly question “global warming” pushed by politicians and government-funded scientists.
“Sarkozy… can see the ocean of votes in speaking out against political correctness,” reported JoNova. “He has watched the rise of Marine Le Pen and of Donald Trump.”
“The game has changed.”
It should be no surprise that the largest proponents of “man-made climate change” are in fact globalist politicians who want to eradicate the concept of sovereign nation-states.
Their goal is to scare the world's population into believing “global warming” is too big of a threat for their country to handle alone and thus it can only be “defeated” through the expansion of the UN and other unelected, global bureaucracies at the expense of their nation's sovereignty.
In other words, it's a manufactured problem exaggerated by the government to instigate a public reaction – fear – the government then exploits to offer a predetermined solution: the expansion of government at the public's expense.
This is simply a strategy known as the Hegelian Dialectic that's been used by governments for millennia to expand government power at the expense of individual liberties.
But unfortunately for them, it's no longer as effective.
“Pandering to the global bullies no longer works,” Marco Morano with Climate Depot pointed out. “Once the fear of being called a ‘climate denier' is gone, there is nothing to stop half of the political divide from a phase change.”
“The Brexit shock spreads.”

SQL Puzzle Question
The Product Manager would like to create a pivot table showing by production line and location, the number of product parts in inventory.
The IOE summer intern has already written the query, and it works, but the pivot table is static, and it won't include any newly added locations within the factory.
Can you take the intern's query and turn it into a dynamic query?
Here is the query the intern wrote:
SELECT ProductLine, [Debur and Polish], [Final Assembly], [Finished Goods Storage], [Frame Forming], [Frame Welding], [Metal Storage], [Miscellaneous Storage], [Paint], [Paint Shop], [Paint Storage], [Sheet Metal Racks], [Specialized Paint], [Subassembly], [Tool Crib] FROM ( SELECT I.ProductID, P.ProductLine as ProductLine, L.Name as LocationNAme FROM Production.ProductInventory I INNER JOIN Production.Location L ON L.LocationID = I.LocationID INNER JOIN Production.Product P ON me.ProductID = P.ProductID ) as PivotData PIVOT ( COUNT(ProductID) FOR LocationName IN ( [Debur and Polish], [Final Assembly], [Finished Goods Storage], [Frame Forming], [Frame Welding], [Metal Storage], [Miscellaneous Storage], [Paint], [Paint Shop], [Paint Storage], [Sheet Metal Racks], [Specialized Paint], [Subassembly], [Tool Crib] ) ) AS PivotResult ORDER BY ProductLine

One look at the intern's query (see above) and you'll notice there is a long list of columns which are repeated in two locations within the query. These column names are unique location values, and due to the nature of how a pivot table works, need to be included in the query, for that location's values to be displayed in the results.
To make the query dynamic, our task is to automatically generate the column name list based off the data. In other words, we want to replace the yellow highlighted portion with code to automatically generate the column list.
The steps we'll take to generate the dynamic pivot table are:
Get a list of unique product lines Create a column list Construct a Pivot Table as SQL Statement Execute the statement
Step 1. Get a list of unique locations
The first step is to construct a query to get a unique list of locations. The locations will be used as column names in our pivot table.
The query I used is:
SELECT DISTINCT L.Name FROM Production.ProductInventory P INNER JOIN Production.Location L ON L.LocationID = P.LocationID
Which produces the following list.
Obtaining this list is just the first step. Now we need to take the location values and transform them into a string having a form similar to [location name 1], [location name 2], etc.
Step 2. Create a Column List
The plan is to crate the column list and store it in a variable. This variable is then used to construct the pivot statement.
We'll declare the @Columns variable as VARCHAR, and then using the query from above and input, build the column list.
DECLARE @Columns as VARCHAR(MAX) SELECT @Columns = COALESCE(@Columns + ', ','') + QUOTENAME(Name) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT L.Name FROM Production.ProductInventory P INNER JOIN Production.Location L ON L.LocationID = P.LocationID ) AS B ORDER BY B.Name
There are a couple of items to note. First, we use the built-in function QUOTENAME to properly format the column name. This ensures brackets [] are placed around the column names.
The statement SELECT @Columns = @Columns… iterates through the result and repeatedly concatenates the next location name to @Columns. This trick allows us to build a single value from many rows.
The COALESCE statement is used for the first assignment when @Columns is NULL. If it wasn't used, then @Columns would always return NULL as concatenating any value to NULL results in NULL.
Here is the result of running this portion of the query:
[Debur and Polish], [Final Assembly], [Finished Goods Storage], [Frame Forming], [Frame Welding], [Metal Storage], [Miscellaneous Storage], [Paint], [Paint Shop], [Paint Storage], [Sheet Metal Racks], [Specialized Paint], [Subassembly], [Tool Crib]
Notice it is exactly like the column list shown in the intern's original query!
Step 3. Construct a pivot table as SQL Statement
Compare the following to the intern's statement. There are a couple of key differences:
DECLARE @SQL as VARCHAR(MAX) SET @SQL = 'SELECT ProductLine, ' + @Columns + ' FROM ( SELECT I.ProductID, P.ProductLine as ProductLine, L.Name as LocationNAme FROM Production.ProductInventory I INNER JOIN Production.Location L ON L.LocationID = I.LocationID INNER JOIN Production.Product P ON me.ProductID = P.ProductID ) as PivotData PIVOT ( COUNT(ProductID) FOR LocationName IN (' + @Columns + ') ) AS PivotResult ORDER BY ProductLine'
First you see that we're constructing a SQL statement in a VARCHAR. Also, notice that the column names, calculated in step two and housed in @Columns, are placed in the statement as well.
When complete the variable @SQL will contain the complete pivot statement. It is the static pivot statement intern wrote.
Now all that remain is to execute the statement.
Step 4. Execute the Statement
The EXEC statement accepts a variable and executes the evaluated result as an SQL statement.
For instance to run the statement ‘SELECT FirstName FROM Person.Person' we could write
EXEC('SELECT FirstName FROM Person.Person')
However, what makes EXEC really useful, is the ability to pass it a variable whose contents contain a SQL statement. Consider the following:
DECLARE @SQL VARCHAR(MAX); SET @SQL = 'SELECT FirstName FROM Person.Person'; EXEC(@SQL);
This produces the same result as the first example however, now the SQL is housed in a variable.
This is what allows us to write dynamic statements.
As you may have guessed, now that we're through step three, we have a complete pivot statement in the variable @SQL. All we need to do now is execute it.
EXEC(@SQL);
We've now seen all the steps. Let's see what the final solution looks like.
Dynamic Pivot Table Solution
To help put this in perspective here is the final solution. Each color coded section corresponds to one of the four steps detailed above:
In case you want to try running this code on AdventureWorks, I've included a text version below:
DECLARE @Columns as VARCHAR(MAX) SELECT @Columns = COALESCE(@Columns + ', ','') + QUOTENAME(Name) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT L.Name FROM Production.ProductInventory P INNER JOIN Production.Location L ON L.LocationID = P.LocationID ) AS B ORDER BY B.Name DECLARE @SQL as VARCHAR(MAX) SET @SQL = 'SELECT ProductLine, ' + @Columns + ' FROM ( SELECT I.ProductID, P.ProductLine as ProductLine, L.Name as LocationNAme FROM Production.ProductInventory I INNER JOIN Production.Location L ON L.LocationID = I.LocationID INNER JOIN Production.Product P ON me.ProductID = P.ProductID ) as PivotData PIVOT ( COUNT(ProductID) FOR LocationName IN (' + @Columns + ') ) AS PivotResult ORDER BY ProductLine' EXEC(@SQL)
Pampered Silicon Valley employees at Facebook and Google think they spearheaded the standing desk revolution. This is revisionist history. The real heroes of this ergonomic war are the countless grunts in the trenches who didn't have a "wellness program" to foot the bill for a $4,000 adjustable desk. Instead, these resourceful men and women cobbled together their Homo erectus workstations out of consumer detritus like Rubbermaid storage bins, beer cases, and saw horses. There's even a $22 hack made with Ikea spare parts that's quite popular.
Realizing there was a market for a more elegant solution that wouldn't break the bank, Ikea began selling the Bekant Sit/Stand Desk last month amid zero fanfare or PR hype. The Bekant—Swedish for “friend”—earned its name because this is the best deal going for a full-size, electrically adjustable standing desk. Base model: $489. That's right, no hand cranking or lift-lock pins to deal with. Just four motors concealed in the legs that raise and lower the desktop at the push of a button.
This hybrid desk won't win any fancy design awards, but it's not aesthetically offensive either. It actually replaces the Gallant, the flat-pack icon of Internet startups from Santa Clara to Shanghai. You might even mistake it for a Gallant at first glance. The particleboard and stain-proof veneer top is identical (with the same 8 options), but the legs are a bit chunkier to accommodate the internal electronics capable of supporting 154 pounds. There is one caveat: maximum height tops out at 48 inches. That means extreme ectomorphs—six-foot-four and over—may have to resort to plastic bins and beer cases. Early reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. The only problem seems to be finding one. If your local Ikea store has a Bekant in stock, buy it and flip it to someone on Apartment Therapy.
Outrage over new phone app which allows users to video their date agreeing to sex to protect them against rape claims
Sexual partners record consent on camera, which is then stored as file
App is able to tell if a sexual partner is not in a fit state to say 'yes'
Critics say it suggests rape is due to misunderstanding not sexual violence
CPS wants those accused of rape to prove they took steps to gain consent
Published: 15:17, 13 July 2015 | Updated: 16:11, 13 July 2015
A new app aimed at reducing false allegations of rape has been launched and forces would-be lovers to record their consent before having sex in case the police get involved.
We-Consent users film 20-second clips on their phones stating who they are about to have sex with before recording their face and their partner's.
The app only works if the cameras detect human faces and both parties are clearly heard saying 'yes', otherwise the recording is stopped and they are encouraged not to have sex.
Developers say their app will end 'misunderstandings' but rape support groups say they are wrongly suggesting rape is about disagreements about consent rather than a decision made by a rapist.

Copy link to paste in your message +2 New app: We-Consent encourages sexual partners to say they are agreeing to have sex on camera, which is then stored in case the police get involved
We-Consent users are asked to confirm their names on camera before they are asked: 'Say yes or no'. If the users say 'yes' the app responds with: 'Consent confirmed. Have fun'.
When asked who the app is targeted towards, the US designer, Michael Lissack, explained it is American athletes who have become fraught in numerous recent sexual scandals.
He said: 'Who seems to be mostly involved with scandals? Athletic teams and fraternities.'
Among critics of the app is the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre, which slammed it for apparently showing rape is the result of misunderstanding rather than an attack.
A spokesman said: 'This app seems to completely misunderstand sexual consent as an ongoing process rather than a one-off decision.
'It also appears to be based on the myth of sexual miscommunication, that rape is the result of a misunderstanding of consent rather than a decision made by a rapist.'
It came after a string of high profile cases in recent years, including one involving footballer Ched Evans, who was convicted of rape after a jury agreed unanimously his victim was too drunk to consent to sex.
High profile: Ched Evans was convicted of rape after a jury agreed that his victim was not capable of consent because she was too drunk
Earlier this year the country's top prosecutor said men accused of date rape must be quizzed by police over the ‘steps they took' to establish that a woman agreed to sex.
Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said detectives should question a suspect about ‘what assured him' the alleged victim had consented.
New guidelines would guarantee a ‘more balanced consideration' of the accounts of both the suspect and the alleged victim, she said.
Campaigners described the move as a ‘huge step forward' in ensuring fewer rapists escaped justice.
But critics said the measures threatened to shift the burden of proof by moving towards making rape suspects prove they were innocent.
We-Consent has been met with mixed reactions, with some saying it increases the perception that false allegations of rape are more common than in reality.
Those who expressed lukewarm support include Elouise Beverley, a member of the Royal Holloway, University of London's feminist society.
She told student newspaper The Tab: 'I think it's positive to encourage dialogue about consent and I hope this app helps to do that.
'But the creator's focus on keeping athletes away from sex scandals seems to encourage the idea that false accusations of rape and sexual assault are more common than they are really.
'It seems the creator is more concerned with the reputations of perpetrators than the well-being of survivors of sexual assault.
'However despite those concerns I think checking in to make sure everyone is sober and making informed consent is definitely a step in the right direction.'
It is not clear where the consent clips are stored but the app website states they are held for seven years and can be made available only by a court order.
A CPS report showed that in a 17-month period there were 5,651 prosecutions of rape, and 111,891 for domestic violence, in England and Wales but there were just 35 prosecutions of false allegations of rape.

In terms of content selection, ESPN, ABC, NBC, Comedy Central and many more -- including a load of popular podcast networks -- will be available inside the app. Broad City's Abbi and Ilana were on hand to promote the new content stream, so if you're a fan of the series, you'll be able to see more of the duo. As you might expect, there's exclusive content too, like a dance move of the day from Amy Poehler. Spotify is certainly taking aim at Tidal, as that service that offers music videos, performances and more to its subscribers. While musicians weren't mentioned too much during today's video chatter, there's sure to Spotify Sessions available for viewing. Deezer added podcasts just days ago, but from the looks of it, Spotify is looking to offer a wealth of content that's not just limited to piping in audio episodes. The new version will go live in the US, UK, Germany and Sweden today with a global launch on the way soon.
ICE stands for "in case of emergency," and it's what many of us have been taught to look for if someone needs medical attention. Well, what if that person is you? Where is your ICE info? One of the easiest and most convenient places to keep emergency information is on your smartphone, but only if you know the right way to do it so that someone can see it without having to unlock your phone. Now is a great time to make sure you and everyone in your family has ICE info on their phone, especially smartphone-carrying students who might be heading back to school soon.
Here are a few different ways to add ICE to your phone.
ICE on iPhone
If you have an iPhone, you can add emergency contact information and medical notes so that it is accessible to anyone from your lock screen.
1. Open the Apple Health app, which is installed on all iOS devices running iOS 8 and later. This app can't be uninstalled.
2. Tap on Medical ID in the bottom right corner.
3. Tap Create Medical ID.
4. At the very top, make sure Show When Locked is turned on (to green). Fill in as much information as is relevant to you. If you have no known allergies or aren't taking medication, it still helps to write "None" or "None known" so that medical personnel don't assume you've overlooked these fields.
5. Make sure you assign at least one person as your emergency contact person. You must save that person's name and phone number in your Contacts app for the Health app to be able to include it.
6. Hit Done to save.
Now here's how to test it to make sure it worked, and to make sure you know what to look for if you ever have to find someone else's ICE info. Lock your phone. Now wake it up but don't fully unlock it with the passcode or Touch ID. When you slide to get to the passcode screen, you should see Emergency at the top. Press it, and a new screen appears with a number keypad to dial, as well as Medical ID in the bottom left. Press Medical ID, and you'll see your information appear along with a phone icon that, when pressed, will automatically dial your ICE contact. Note that while you can find ICE apps in the App Store, they are not accessible from a locked phone! You should always lock your iPhone with a passcode or TouchID for security reasons, meaning these ICE apps are useless in a real emergency. Use the Apple Health app instead.
ICE on Android
Depending on which phone you have and which version of Android you're running, you might have an emergency contact feature in your phone's setting. Check there first. It might be under a sub-menu such as My Information. In many cases, the end results is a free form string of text that scrolls across your locked screen.
If you can't find an emergency contact field within the settings, there are apps for adding ICE info, but you'll need one that has a widget accessible from the lock screen. Note that not all versions of Android support lock screen apps anymore. It's tricky.
I also recommend not relying on an app that sends emergency information via text messaging. When a true emergency is happening, first responders need to know whether they've reached an emergency contact. They can't wait around for someone to reply to a text message.
For Android 4.2 and later, the ICE: In Case of Emergency app ($3.99) seems promising (I haven't personally tested it). It has a lock screen widget and lets you save important information as well as ICE names and numbers. Some user feedback suggests that it may disable alarms, however. If you use your Android as an alarm clock, you might want to consider other options before shelling out four bucks for this app.
ICE on Windows Phone
To add ICE info to a Windows Phone, you'll want to use a lock screen app. These apps typically display messages on your lock screen. Some people use them to add their personal information (so someone can return their phone if it's lost), but ICE info may be a better use case.
The app Lock Screen Text can do the trick, but you'll have limited space. I recommend writing little more than ICE plus a person's first name and phone number. Reserve the rest of the space for additional medical notes you may have. You could even write a short directive, such as, "Extensive medical notes in wallet" or something to that effect.
ICE on BlackBerry
On a BlackBerry 10 device, the best way to add ICE information is by saving it as a note on your lock screen.
1. Swipe down from the top to pull up the home screen menu.
2. Select Settings.
3. Choose Security and Privacy, then Lock Screen.
4. Choose Lock Screen Message. You'll see two fields where you can enter the name of a contact (I recommend putting ICE before the name) and phone number, or any other medical information you might want to share, such as medical conditions and allergies. Keep your notes short and sweet, as you have limited space.
ICE Hack Job for Any Smartphone
On any smartphone, there's one really simple way to add ICE information.
1. Open any note-taking app.
2. Type whatever ICE information you want in the note. Make sure you have margins on all sides and that the text easily fits on one screen.
3. Take a screenshot of that note.
4. Use that note as your lock screen wallpaper.
With this method, an emergency responder will have to dial the number that appears on the lock screen wallpaper, rather than have the phone dial it for him or her, but it's better than nothing!
Cases: one of them gets hurt on the case and the other has a bitch-fit from it and then love confessions happen
Sam: SHIPS IT LIKE 1000% and figures out they love each other before they even figure it out themselves. is totes okay with Dean being bi even though Dean is under the impression that Sam will hate him for it.
Charlie: Dean's bestie. hella nerdy and cute and talks Dean through all of his bullshit and lets him know that it's okay to be into guys.
Benny: always says ‘brother' and is Dean's bestie. he and Dean used to do it back in the day, but they're totes just friends now.
Kevin: doesn't ever know what's going on and doesn't give two shits about anything.
John and Mary: John is a shitty dad and gives Dean shit for being bi. makes shit awkward for Dean but Cas handles it like a pro. he eventually comes around and is okay with Dean being with Cas. sometimes. not always. Mary is the best mom ever and loves Cas like her own and cooks them a lot of food.
Anna: Cas' older sister that loves him and listens to all of his bitching about his problems with Dean. Anna is just great in fics, okay?
Gabriel: Cas' older bro that loves candy and takes Cas to strip clubs all the time.
Michael: Cas' oldest sibling who ruins shit for Cas all the time. OR. he's the big bro that took care of Cas while they were growing up and is the best.
Cas' Parents: this is always weird, uncharted territory in fic. like, sometimes Amelia Novak is his mom and Jimmy is his dad? sometimes, Naomi is is mom? idefk. but they're always HUGE assholes or dead. sad, i know.
Dean's sexuality: Dean is either 100% confident in his bisexuality or is in so much denial that he overcompensates by fucking a lot of women.
Wings: Dean fucking loves them and wants to touch them 24/7. Cas gets off on it. like, always.
Freckles: Dean has like a million of them
Hair: “styled within an inch of its life”, “sex hair”, “sleep mussed”, and “rumpled” are all different ways that Cas' hair is described. it's perfect.
Eyes: the greenest green that ever did green and the bluest blue that ever did blue. they get lost in each other's all the time. it's perfect.
Trenchcoat: Cas is always wearing the damn thing. no matter what.
Cas' Voice: deeper than anything ever and it gives Dean instant boners.
“Hello, Dean”: NO MATTER WHAT WORLD WE ARE IN, NO MATTER HOW AU THE AU IS, IT'S ALWAYS “Hello, Dean”. ALWAYS.
Conflict: someone freaks out about some kind of miscommunication and it all goes to shit for, like, a chapter or two.
Resolution: each of their friends kick their asses for being so stupid because of the miscommunication and then they finally realize that they're done fucked up and it all is fixed and everything is happy. unless, for some reason, OP is hell-bent on making shit sad, then they stay broken up forever and ever.
Sexy-Times: this topic inspires a shit ton of conflict within the fandom. “WHO BOTTOMS?!?” is the biggest question. the fact is that it doesn't really matter because the sex ranges from “awkward first times” to “holy shit that is the greatest thing ever”. they literally do it everywhere at anytime and they're both insatiable.
Conclusion: i can never get enough of this perfect shit
Radical anti-war revolutionary turned education advocate Bill Ayers said Tuesday he believed President Barack Obama should be charged with war crimes.
Ayers, who co-founded the far left revolutionary Weather Underground group, told Tom Bevan and Charlie Stone of Real Clear Politics that Obama's use of targeted drone strikes was “absolutely” a form of terrorism.
“Every president in this century should be put on trial for war crimes,” he said. “Absolutely. Every one of them goes into an office dripping with blood and then adds to it. And yes, I think these are war crimes. I think they're acts of terror.”
Ayers said he would give Obama a failing grade as president, though he was admittedly fond of his curious and intellectual personality.
The purported friendship between Ayers and Obama was viciously attacked during the 2008 presidential campaign. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin infamously questioned why Obama was “palling around with terrorists” and Fox News host Sean Hannity frequently used Ayers as proof Obama was a radical socialist.
Ayers has said Obama was nothing more than an neighborly acquaintance, whom he only interacted with through their mutual involvement in charitable organizations and the University of Chicago.

There was a story making the rounds on social media this week about how dire the affordable-housing situation is in San Francisco, including the lack of rental stock.
The reporter found a woman who commutes 260 kilometres, round trip, daily to her job in the Bay area. She wakes up shortly after two in the morning each day, and leaves for work around four.
An extreme example, certainly. But San Francisco has become the poster child for the great affordable-housing crisis that is gripping big-name cities across the United States and around the world. And as with many of these cities, one problem San Francisco is plagued with is empty homes.
Story continues below advertisement
What's shocking is how late to the party Frisco has been to do anything about it. Currently, the city assesses an annual fee of $711 (U.S.) for any home deemed to be vacant. Quite a deterrent. Only now is San Francisco starting to look at what other jurisdictions are doing to deal with this issue, including Vancouver. They will almost certainly be assessing the route the city of Paris has gone as well.
The city of light has been trying to deal with its vacant-home dilemma for some time. The most-recent estimate showed there were more than 107,000 of them of various descriptions – or about 10 per cent of all residential abodes in the city. The number of non-resident homes in Paris rose 43 per cent in the past 15 years, compared with just 3 per cent over that same period for those that are owner-occupied.
Starting in 2015, the city elected to tax vacant homes the equivalent of 20 per cent of the fair market value of rent. It did not have the desired effect. This year, they decided to triple the amount to 60 per cent.
For the sake of argument, let's say an apartment is designated vacant and its fair market rental value is determined to be the equivalent of $2,000 Canadian a month, or $24,000 a year. The homeowner would pay about $14,400 in tax on that unit – or almost $10,000 more than she was paying when it was just 20 per cent.
Now, $2,000 a month in rent for an apartment in the middle of Paris would be a steal. More likely, you're looking at $3,000 or even higher. Most of the vacant homes in the French capital are found in the city's trendiest districts, between the 1st and 8th arrondissements. The foreign owners of these properties can likely afford the extra tax they will now have to pay.
So, the tax may not ultimately force owners to sell or rent year round, but the city is going to rake in a lot of money – an estimated additional $63-million (Canadian), which the city plans to use to build affordable rental housing where it can.
This is not the only thing Paris has done. Last year, it applied caps on rent increases, against the vociferous opposition of real estate agents and developers. The city also makes Airbnb collect a tourist tax from those using the rental website.

Collectively, it all looks fairly aggressive, especially when contrasted with a city such as Toronto, which seems unsure about the wisdom of a vacant-homes tax – something it is "studying." But as radical as Paris' approach to this problem seems, certainly as far as a 60-per-cent vacancy tax goes, it still isn't as severe as Vancouver's solution.
Starting next year, the city will ding property owners who leave their place vacant for six months or more a 1-per-cent surcharge on the assessed value of their property. In a city where $1-million is the entry point for detached properties, and many townhouses and condos, too, that represents potentially a huge cash haul. The owner of that $1-million vacant house would have to pay $10,000 in tax. Given most houses on the west side of the city are assessed at double and triple that amount, people will be paying $20,000, $30,000 or more in a vacant-home tax.
According to the 2016 census, there were more than 25,000 unoccupied or empty homes in the city.
Not surprisingly, the tax has not been popular with those people who could be zapped by it. Even if they acquiesce and rent their place out, it has tax implications for them. But on the other hand, what is the city supposed to do?
It has an affordable-housing crisis on its hands, a rental-stock emergency, too. Cities such as Vancouver and Paris have opted for extreme remedies to deal with a problem that won't be solved by half measures. For that, they should be applauded, not condemned.
WASHINGTON — A Kuwaiti man held by the United States without trial for nearly 13 years in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was released early Wednesday, the military said. His repatriation is the first transfer to result from a new system of parole-board-like hearings to periodically review whether it is still necessary to keep holding prisoners.
The Kuwaiti, Fawzi al Odah, is also only the second low-level prisoner to be released from Guantanamo this year. Last year, President Obama had pledged to revive his efforts to close the prison. Administration officials said an end-of-year flurry might be coming: The Pentagon has notified Congress that nine other detainees, including six binds for Uruguay, may soon be transferred.
Still, there are signs that disagreements remain within the administration over how much risk to accept as it tries to winnow down the population of low-level inmates and close the prison.

The administration had been poised to repatriate four Afghans who have long been approved for transfer, but Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel recently pulled back from that plan, according to officials.

The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive deliberations, said the administration decided at a “principals' committee” meeting on Oct. 3 in the White House Situation Room, chaired by Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, to proceed with notifying Congress that it intended to repatriate the four Afghans.
The notice was supposed to be given within a week after the State Department obtained an unspecified security assurance from the Afghan government. That was completed three weeks ago, they said, but Hagel has still not sent the notice.
Although the Pentagon signed off on their repatriation as part of a 2009 interagency task force, officials familiar with the deliberations said Hagel decided to reassess the timing after General John F. Campbell, the top military leader in Afghanistan, and General Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, expressed concerns that they might attack US troops.
The officials also said that Hagel was still actively considering the proposed Afghan transfers.

A spokesman for Hagel, Rear Admiral John Kirby, declined to specifically comment about the Afghans. But he described the department's deliberations about whether security risk has been mitigated as including “inputs from commanders in the field, whose perspectives are not only greatly valued by the secretary but heavily relied upon.”
It is unusual for a Cabinet secretary to independently reconsider a decision reached at a principals' committee meeting. But Guantanamo transfers are an unusual type of policy decision because Congress has vested that authority in the secretary of defense. A statute says that at least 30 days before any transfer, he must notify lawmakers that he has determined that it would be in the national interest.
In an agreement with the Kuwaiti government, Odah, whose name is sometimes spelled Fouzi al Awda, will now live in custody there as part of a yearlong rehabilitation program, officials said.
He is the first detainee to be transferred since May, when the Obama administration sent five high-level Taliban prisoners — who were not recommended for release — to Qatar in a prisoner swap for Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, the only US prisoner of war from the Afghan war. Angering lawmakers, Hagel did not provide 30 days' advance notice to Congress for that swap; the administration said any delay could have endangered Bergdahl's life.
Since 2009, the executive branch has used a more stringent process of individualized review before releasing detainees. About 19 percent of former detainees released during the Bush administration have been deemed confirmed recidivists, compared with 6.8 percent of those released under the Obama administration.

Odah, the Kuwaiti released Wednesday, was a plaintiff in a case that helped establish that courts have jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus lawsuits filed by Guantanamo detainees. But in 2009, a judge upheld Odah's wartime detention.
Then, if the devils die out in Tasmania, Dr. Belov said, “the disease will be gone from the mainland, and then they can be introduced back in the wild.”
Biologists first encountered the cancer in the late 1990s. The tumors grew on the devils' faces or inside their mouths, and within six months the animals were dead. The first cases appeared in eastern Tasmania, and with each passing year the cancer's range expanded westward.
When scientists examined the cells in the tumors, they got a baffling surprise. The DNA from each tumor did not match the Tasmanian devil on which it grew. Instead, it matched the tumors on other devils. That meant that the cancer was contagious, spreading from one animal to another.
There are only a few reports of humans developing cancer from other people's tumors hidden in transplanted skin or other organs. Only one other example of contagious cancer is known from the natural world, a tumor in dogs.
Dr. Murchison led a team of researchers who sequenced the entire genome of two tumor cells. They published the sequences last February, and since then they have launched a project to sequence hundreds more genomes of Tasmanian devil facial tumors.
Their studies and others like them are revealing how the Tasmanian cancer got its start. It probably originated in the 1980s or early 1990s in a single animal, most likely a female. A nerve cell in her face underwent a drastic mutation: its chromosomes shattered and then stitched themselves back together.
“The cell was still able to function, because there wasn't too much DNA lost,” Dr. Belov said. “It's a bit of a freak of nature.”
It started with two Fire Trucks, four police cars and an ambulance.

Realizing that I'm back in a mental institution.
There is so much I don't remember about overdosing on Adivan. I have absolutely no recollection of taking more than two pills. I don't remember talking with my Doctor, but apparently I did as he is the one that called in the rescue squad. I couldn't tell a single thing about the whole ambulance and emergency room experience. In fact, I really don't remember anything from the afternoon of the overdose until I woke up in the mental hospital three days later.
I had been in this hospital before, so I knew where I was once I became coherent. I just didn't know why I was there. It was only by piecing bits and pieces together that I picked up talking with the hospital staff, my friends, and the people at the apartment where I live that helped me to figure out what happened.
I've said this before; the overdose was accidental. I was depressed, and having a hard time keeping the bad thoughts away. I felt like the only way to turn off the brain was to get some sleep, so I took off early and went home to try to take a nap. Sleep wouldn't come, so I took a couple of adivan to try to knock myself out for a little while. I think that I woke up a little later but didn't realize that it was only a short while, so I took a couple more to push myself back to sleep. That's when the confusion set in because my memory stops there, but apparently I continued to take the Adivan until I had emptied the whole bottle. Somewhere during this time I must have called my Doctor. He told me later that we had several conversations during which he was very concerned that I was in trouble. The last conversation with him, he said he would call back in two hours to see how I was doing, but by then I was out of it. When he couldn't get in touch with me, he called the police for a well check. Talking with my neighbors later I found out that the rescue squad was called in, and that I was transported out in the ambulance. It's reasonable to presume I went to the emergency room, and this was confirmed by my Girlfriend who figured out where I was after she started calling the local hospitals when she couldn't get in touch with me. After that I had just brief glimpses of where I was starting with being handcuffed and trying unsuccessfully to wake myself up. It really wasn't until I was able to become fully awake that my memory picks back up.
Having been in this hospital before, it was easy to get back into the routine. Initially I was confined to the unit and the staff had to check on my every 15 minutes. The standard day began with breakfast around 7:00am, Medications around 9:00am, and the first group therapy at 9:30am. Since I couldn't leave, initially my meals were delivered directly to the ward. The food wasn't all that great, but it wasn't horrible either.
The morning group therapy was fairly simple. A mental health technician would go around the room and ask for your name, how you're feeling and what your goals are for the day. Every once in a while someone would actually want to talk about something, but usually it was just a quick “I'm doing fine, my goal is to remain positive and get better”. After just a few days in-patient most people were either feeling better, or having a rough time with confinement and just wanted to go home. If you weren't positive, it could affect how soon you could be discharged, so most everyone tried to appear to be doing better so they could get out.
No outside psychiatrists were able to practice in the hospital, so an in-house doctor was assigned upon admission. Every day everyone would meet with their doctor where they would talk about how they were doing with the medications and make any adjustments needed. The doctors also had to approve anything that had to do with being in the hospital from privileges such as being able to go to the cafeteria to simple creature comforts like being able to shave.
It was a big deal when the medications were handed out. Everyone there was very focused on getting better and wanted the medications right on time. Plus, there wasn't a lot to do outside of group therapy and eating, and getting medications was another event to break up the day. There was generally a lot of anxiety about the drugs as everybody wanted to be first in line and not have to wait. There was also a lot of complaining about the nurse handing out the drugs; either she was too slow, or unfair with how she called you up for your time, or anything that could be perceived that she was doing wrong.
After the morning group therapy there wasn't a whole lot to do until lunch, and most just hung around a community day room watching TV or gossiping about other patients. Everyone was in the hospital for a reason, and being confined with so many who were just as unstable resulted in a lot of drama and conflicts. For example, it was almost impossible to get all the patients to agree on what program to watch on TV, and there were a lot of fights. The staff was an easy target too, and a lot of the complaints and unrest were directed at them. They never kept enough coffee or lemon aid in the day room, and they wouldn't let you do ANYTHING. (Which they couldn't do unless it was approved by your Doctor)
The next group therapy was at 3:30. It was run by the hospital social worker and was usually to teach some kind of self help skill like visualization or relaxation techniques. Most of the time it would be listening to a recorded CD with a generally available generic program, and a few of them actually had commercials promoting their own product. But the information could be useful, and this was the most productive of all the groups.
Dinner was just another time to eat. By the time I could go down to the cafeteria it was better as it took a full hour by the time you walked down, stood in line, and actually sat down to eat. It still came with some drama however. Each ward wanted to go through the line first and there was a lot of competition to get there before other units and complaints when you didn't. Then there was always the fear that they would run out of some of the food and there wouldn't be any choices. And that did happen, so the feelings were valid. But it was good to get off the ward and at least see something different.
After dinner was the longest downtime. From the end of dinner at 6:00pm until the last group therapy at 9:30, there was really nothing to do. It was a little easier to agree on TV programs during prime time and the fights were more limited. But still, being idle for three and a half hours generated a lot of stress which affected both the patients and the staff.
The last group therapy of the day was a reverse of the first one. Again, the Mental Health Technician would go around the room, but this time asking if you had reached your goal or not. As we wanted out, most of us made sure we reported that we were successful. It was important to appear that you were making a lot of progress and your treatment was successful. This usually didn't take too long, and then it was time for evening medications and then either hanging out in the day room again, or heading to bed if you had taken anything for sleep.
Honestly, there wasn't a whole lot that was actively therapeutic from being in the hospital. There were no one on one sessions with anyone, no individual therapy and very little direct value from any of the group activities. What it did provide however was a place to be safe from yourself. It gave you a chance to decompress. You could focus on the inside and at least try to come to grips with what put you in the hospital. Being there took you away from the stress and interferences experienced with the day-to-day living on the outside. It also gave you time to dwell on the negative, but even that was okay as there was a chance to work through these in a safe environment. And just wanting to not be confined gave you the motivation to really try to get better.
I don't ever want to go back to the hospital, and am I working as hard as I can with my Therapist and Psychiatrist to keep my illness in check and remain as healthy as possible. Just the threat of another hospitalization can be a great motivator and help to keep me focused on maintaining my illness. Even though it wasn't the greatest experience, it was necessary, and I'm glad that it was available.
And, God willing, I'll never have to do it again.

Topical antiseptics are frequently used in dermatological management, yet evidence for the efficacy of traditional generic formulations is often largely anecdotal. We tested the in vitro bactericidal activity of four commonly used topical antiseptics against Staphylococcus aureus, using a modified version of the European Standard EN 1276, a quantitative suspension test for evaluation of the bactericidal activity of chemical disinfectants and antiseptics. To meet the standard for antiseptic effectiveness of EN 1276, at least a 5 log10 reduction in bacterial count within 5 minutes of exposure is required. While 1% benzalkonium chloride and 6% hydrogen peroxide both achieved a 5 log10 reduction in S. aureus count, neither 2% aqueous eosin nor 1 : 10 000 potassium permanganate showed significant bactericidal activity compared with control at exposure periods of up to 1 h. Aqueous eosin and potassium permanganate may have desirable astringent properties, but these results suggest they lack effective antiseptic activity, at least against S. aureus.

People in the small Polish village of Gruta got a surprise visit from the U.S. Army yesterday, when six American helicopters got lost in a thick fog while flying back from Lithuania and were forced to land in a nearby rapeseed field to ask for directions.
Locals told Bloomberg that they were stunned to see military aircraft land in their fields in the middle of the night, but provided them with English pamphlets and sent the grateful airment on their way. “Now, when I think about it we could have served them some food, but we were in shock and the boys had to go,” Halina Kowalkowska, the village's head, said in an interview.
Though it's probably the biggest thing to happen to the village, which boasts a population of 1,600 people, they had every right to be worried, due to the fact that their village is somewhat close to Poland's border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. In response to escalating Russian aggression in Ukraine, NATO has increased its military presence in the region, and the airmen themselves were returning to a nearby base from military exercises in Lithuania.
“We know that security is the most important thing right now,” Kowalkowska said. “But thank God it was the Americans.”

Don't expect the winner of UFC 207's main card bout between T.J. Dillashaw and John Lineker to be promised the next title shot in the UFC bantamweight division.
Despite the matchup pitting Dillashaw (13-3 MMA, 9-3 UFC), No. 2 in the latest USA TODAY Sports/MMAjunkie MMA bantamweight rankings, against No. 8-ranked Lineker (29-7 MMA, 10-2 UFC) taking place on the same card as the 135-pound title fight between Dominick Cruz (22-1 MMA, 5-0 UFC) and Cody Garbrandt (10-0 MMA, 5-0 UFC), the UFC is not yet willing to declare it an official No. 1 contender fight.
Sean Shelby, the UFC matchmaker for the bantamweight division, praised Dillashaw vs. Lineker as one of the best fights scheduled for UFC 207. However, he admitted on “The Watch List” for the event that the winner won't be granted any assurances in terms of a future championship fight.
“The great thing about the bantamweight division right now (is) it's on fire,” Shelby said. “I don't think there's another division with more contenders. We'll see what we get out of this fight (as far as a title shot). On paper, regardless of title contendership, it's straight fire. It's all offense.”
UFC 207 takes place Friday at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Dillashaw vs. Lineker airs on the pay-per-view portion of the card following prelims on FS1 and UFC Fight Pass.
There are many factors are play going into the fight. First and foremost is the result of the title clash between No. 1-ranked Cruz and No. 7-ranked Garbrandt. If the challenger Garbrandt were to take the belt, he's already promised an immediate rematch to Cruz. If “The Dominator” were to retain, he has already revealed a lack of interest in fighting Dillashaw a second time after winning the belt from him via a debatable split decision at UFC Fight Night 81 in January.
Moreover, any fight involving Lineker is deemed worthy of pause due to the Brazilian's extensive history of missing weight. He's already come in over on five separate occasions during his UFC tenure and is unlikely to be trusted for a title fight until he can consistently display professionalism when it comes to weight cutting.
Although Dillashaw vs. Lineker seems to have all the ingredients for a No. 1 contender fight, Shelby also noted there are other names in the division who come into play when discussing which person will fight for the belt next.
“(Jimmie) Rivera has been outstanding; you got (Bryan) Caraway who is still up there in the top-six – you got Dodson,” Shelby said. “There are so many guys, and there are guys coming up breaking into the top 10. I'm so happy with the division right now.”

Baby punched in the face at Central Railway Station in Sydney; 28-year-old man arrested and charged
Updated
A man has been charged after he allegedly punched a baby in the face at Central Railway Station in Sydney.
Police said the 16-month-old girl was in her pram with her parents outside a cafe on Eddy Avenue about 11.30am.
Officers will allege a 28-year-old man walked up to the pram and punched the baby in the face before running from the scene.
The baby's father began to chase the man and called out to bystanders to contact police, officers said.
The girl suffered a small cut to her face and was treated by paramedics at the scene.
The 28-year-old man was found in a nearby building on Pitt Street and was arrested and taken to Day Street Police Station.
He was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and refused bail and was expected to appear before Central Local Court on Friday.
Acting Inspector Paul Hanna, who made the arrest, said the man did not appear to be drunk or on drugs.
"We systematically searched a number of buildings in that area and found him in an elevator," Acting Inspector Hanna said.
"I grabbed him out of the elevator. He was very quiet. He didn't appear to be affected by anything.
"He was quite unresponsive. I don't know how you explain that kind of behaviour and he didn't appear to be intoxicated."
Police praise bystanders for helping with arrest
Acting Inspector Hanna said when the man was questioned he did not explain why he punched the baby.
"I suppose he'll give those reasons to the court," he said.
"It's a bit of a puzzle really. It's not something we normally encounter."
Police said it was a quick arrest which was made possible by the help of bystanders.
"We were on scene within five minutes of the call and from memory it would have been within 15 or 20 minutes [that] we had him in the back of the truck," Acting Inspector Hanna said.
"It was a young girl who pointed us in the direction of Pitt Street eventually and helped us narrow it down eventually to where he'd gone to."
He said his team would spend the night preparing CCTV evidence for the court.
"The CCTV being what it is around Central railway, it's very high quality, and very well monitored by those guys so there'd be a fair amount of CCTV that we'll review and prepare a brief for the court tonight," Acting Inspector Hanna said.

A report in Spanish specialist website biciclismo.com cites Movistar directors Eusebio Unzué and José Luis Arrieta as saying that they were trying to sign Chris Froome in 2011 when the Briton produced his breakthrough result in the Vuelta a España.

Froome expects big gaps in final time trial of 2014 Tour de France
Froome awarded the 2013 Vélo d'Or prize
Froome finished second in the Vuelta 2011, behind Juan Jose Cobo but ahead of teammate Bradley Wiggins. It was by far his best ever result in a Grand Tour and made Team Sky desperate to re-signing him as a possible alternative to Wiggins. Froome went on to take his first Tour de France podium in 2012 and then won the Tour de France and dominated stage racing in 2013.
According to Biciclismo, Unzué and Arrieta tried to get Froome to sign with them “but the problem was that he started getting some big results during the negotiations. We were talking with him at the start of the Vuelta, but what looked promising suddenly became reality. He got on the podium and there was no way Team Sky were going to let him go after that. And time has proved them right,” Unzué said.
Unzué does not believe that Froome would be a more successful rider in Movistar than in Team Sky because “on a sporting level he is what he is.” However, he does state that Froome might have taken another Tour de France - presumably that of 2012 - and a Vuelta - in the same year, where Froome finished fourth - had he been with the Spanish squad.
“Either way, he's going to be the rider to beat for the next three or four years,” the Spanish team manager predicted.
Unzué praised Team Sky as “being a team that have improved cycling's image."
"Their success has coincided with the sport's globalisation. That's why beating them in the [UCI World Tour] teams classification is especially satisfying. It means you've beaten the reference point. They've been extremely strong at certain points in the year, but we've been more consistent.”
Movistar will have Nairo Quintana and Alejandro Valverde as team leaders in 2014 but has lost world champion Rui Costa, who will move to Lampre-Merida.

Everton FC starlet Ross Barkley missed the bus as England enjoyed their first World Cup training session in Brazil.
Now the Blues starlet will be hoping he isn't left behind when manager Roy Hodgson names his starting XI for Saturday's opener against Italy in Manaus.
The squad's departure had been delayed as the team bus managed to leave without Barkley.
The driver was forced to stop nearby while the Everton midfielder chased after the coach to board – much to the obvious amusement of his team-mates.

Barkley should be well used to catching buses, having spent much of childhood travelling to Everton's training ground on public transport.
“Mum used to have my sister to look after, so I had to make my own way to training,” said Barkley, in an interview last year. “I would get a bus to town and another one to Netherton. It would take about an hour. I used to get the 79, then the 58 or 51A.
“It's still fresh in my mind. You had other players my age who were getting loads of money. One player used to turn up and his mum and dad had a Bentley.
“I'd be waiting at the bus stop and they would ask me if I wanted a lift home but I'd always say no because I was too embarrassed.”
When the party did belatedly arrive at their training base, a local schoolboy serenaded the players with “We are the champions.”
The players stood awkwardly, in front of hundreds of the world's media, as a group of children played and sang the Queen anthem.
They clapped politely as the youngster finished the song with the line “We are the champions of the world!”
There was muffled laughter among some of the fans who had been allowed in to watch the open training session. But again there was extraordinary security for the squad throughout the day.
As they trained a navy gunboat patrolled the waters off the military base.
Roy Hodgson and his team made the 45 minute journey from their hotel accompanied by several army trucks, a helicopter overhead and even two ambulances.
They then made their way to the Urca training base, at the foot of the Sugar Loaf mountain where they were met by several dozen England fans who were already in Rio.
Players waved to the supporters as they entered the base before taking part the two hour training session.
One fan John Rodgers, 37, from Southampton said: “I was amazed at how much security there was ... it could have been Barack Obama coming in not a football team.
“There were so many soldiers in the cavalcade and two or three ambulances as well.”
Police and FIFA are jittery because of continuing protests. In São Paulo yesterday they used tear gas to break up striking transport workers.
But once inside the base the mood noticably lightened. Dozens of excited local schoolchildren and the sons and daughters of local military personnel watched part of the training.
The team trained for an hour in the sunshine at the historic base. Behind one of the goals were two gleaming white lion statues.And to the side three old English cannons recovered from a shipwreck close to the shore.
But 300 miles away in São Paulo there were nasty scenes as police tried to break up a continuing strike.Politicians have threatened to sack the transport staff if they do not return to work.
But unions have said they will escalate their action and have promised to cause chaos at the opening ceremony just 48 hours away.
The main stadium for the match between Brazil and Croatia is on the outskirts of the city and any further closure of the metro system will cause chaos for supporters and dignitaries attending the match.
Ever been to a wedding or family reunion where the event starts out reasonably genteel, then, as the hours roll by and the attendees start to get tired and/or drunk, things start to get weirder and rowdier? The opening day of CPAC was a lot like that. Plus firearms.
Now, I know what you're thinking. How can CPAC not be gonzo from the opening bell? This isn't some weak-tea of a party convention, where pols have to fret about whether they're going to scare off voters in the mushy middle. Neither is it some bush-league Johnny-come-lately gathering with C-list speakers and a shoe-string budget. No. This is the granddaddy of conservative conclaves, a multi-day, big-budget ideological extravaganza put on by and for the unabashedly conservative wing of the Republican Party. This is a place where Byron York is a celebrity, Andrew Breitbart a fallen hero, and Ronald Reagan a God. Cheesecake photos of Ann Coulter abound, and everywhere you look the NRA is urging you to “Stand and Fight!”
To be sure, there was much fun to be had early on. Outside the massive ballroom where most of the speechifying was taking place, the hallways of the Gaylord Convention Center were hopping. The gasbags on radio row were up and running. Print and TV reporters roamed the hallways, snatching up attendees for impromptu interviews on everything from fetal viability to global warming to Benghazi. Unlike your average Tea Party affair, CPAC draws scads of young folks, many of them sporting bowties, some of them in American-flag-print shorts, and at least one sporting a sky-high orange-and-green Mohawk. Despite the prohibition on official campaign paraphernalia, budding young political operatives handed out buttons and stickers proclaiming, “Stand with Rand” or “Cruz Crew.” Some guy was striding around on super-tall stilts, carrying a “Reagan for President sign.” His female counterpart had no signage, but was made up like a sexy Uncle Sam.
(Complete coverage of CPAC)
The exhibition hall downstairs featured every bit of right-wing goodness you could hope for, with booths by longtime players and scrappy newcomers alike: the Heritage Foundation, AEI, the 2nd Amendment Foundation, the National Taxpayers Union, Regnery Publishing, the Weekly Standard, National Review, Regent University, the Ayn Rand Institute, proenglish.org, the Charles Koch Institute, Accuracy In Media, The Blaze. Tchotchkes ranged from tote bags to candy to bumper stickers to a bright red T-shirt cheekily announcing, “I only sleep with Republicans.” The Sportsman Channel was touting its upcoming new series, “Amazing America with Sarah Palin.” (Airs April 2014!) The anti-tax HowMoneyWalks.com was drawing attention with a not-entirely-intuitive Star Wars theme. (Not that one really needs a reason to dress up like Chewbacca or a Storm Trooper.) Another particularly lively booth was by WarOnYouth.com, whose primary cause was not immediately evident, but which was staffed with a dozen or so young people decked out in military-green T-shirts and bandanas. At one point, they held a noisy tug-of-war with a giant rope in the middle of the exhibit hall. And, of course, the NRA had a vibrant presence, with multiple booths, the hands-down best of which featured a virtual shooting gallery that let folks test their rifle skills at 10, 25, and 50 yards. There was a bookstore in the back, a guy playing the guitar at a stage near the front, sofas and closed-circuit TVs scattered about, and a photo-tainment booth at which giddy attendees could get their pictures taken in funny hats.
Even in the midst of all the merriment, however, were reminders of the ongoing tensions within conservatism. In between display booths, two guys were handing out pamphlets explaining “Why GOProud Does Not Belong at CPAC.” Bottom line: embracing the gay-rights agenda will destroy “the conservative movement's three-legged stool” of “fiscal,” “social,” and “defense” conservatives. (The brochure helpfully featured an illustration of a guy in a blue suit precariously perched atop a “conservative” stool as a ferocious, rainbow-hued beaver gnawed at the “social” leg of the stool.) Throughout the day, you would overhear chit-chat about the ongoing tug-of-war between libertarians and social conservatives. (“We're in a war within our own party!” one CPAC straw-poll worker marveled to a student attendee.) Standing in line for coffee, Joey Kalmin, head of the University of Maryland student Republicans, fretted to me that he wasn't even sure he should be at the convention, given that he didn't agree with social conservatives on so many key issues.
Indeed, addressing this internal uncertainty and discord seemed to be on the mind of many of the morning's A-list speakers. Taking the stage around 9:30, Rep. Paul Ryan assured the crowd that all of the “creative tension” roiling the GOP these days is a good thing. We're the party of ideas, he cheered. “The Republican party is where the action is!” A little before noon, Chris Christie, in full-throttle let-daddy-give-it-to-you-straight mode, similarly lectured the crowd: “We've got to start talking about what we're for and not just what we're against. And the reason for that is very simple,” he explained. “Our ideas are better than their ideas!” This, as it happens, is the very same message that Sen. Mike Lee, who spoke a half hour after Christie, has been test-driving for a couple of months now—along with the corollary that the party needs to work on being a little more Pope Francis and a little less Torquemada: “We as conservatives have got to be far more engaged in finding converts than discarding heretics!”
This is not to suggest that there wasn't much, much, much slamming of the enemy: President Obama, Harry Reid, Obamacare, the media, the IRS, Obamacare, Hillary Clinton, Obamacare, unions, Big Government. (Did I mention Obamacare?) Marco Rubio, strutting his foreign policy stuff, went on at length about the administration's global failures. So did Bushie-turned-AEI-fellow John Bolton. (God, I love that mustache!) Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, talking education reform, expressed dismay that the Department of Justice is opposing his state's school-voucher program. Playing to the crowd, Jindal compared Attorney General Eric Holder to Alabama's segregationist-loving former Gov. George Wallace: “We've got Eric Holder and the Department of Justice trying to stand in the schoolhouse door to prevent minority kids, low-income kids, kids who haven't had access to a great education, the chance to go to better schools.” Well played, Governor: Nothing tickles conservatives more than being assured that Democrats are the party of intolerant racists.
I take that back. The one thing that may have tickled them more was when Mitch McConnell showed up on stage brandishing a rifle. (It was a gift for colleague Tom Coburn, who is retiring this year because of health problems.) The crowd was delighted. Alas, that was pretty much all that McConnell did that delighted them, because a) everyone at CPAC knows the minority leader increasingly loathes the right-wing of the party and is desperately smooching their backsides only because of that unfortunate primary battle brewing back in Kentucky, and b) McConnell is about as charismatic as a box of stale prunes.
But these are pretty much the standard antics you'd expect at CPAC. And, for the most part, the major speakers stayed even keeled and non hysterical. Every now and again, you got the sneaking suspicion that party leaders had all gotten the same memo, generated in the bowels of some unseen uberconsultant's office, warning that the party needs to stop being seen as so negative and critical and scary and mean and anti-everything.
Then came the afternoon entertainment. Perhaps in an effort to keep folks awake post-lunch, Wayne LaPierre and Donald Trump were the 1-2 closing punch of the day's orations. The NRA's always electrifying VP/CEO went first, delivering precisely the kind of high-velocity, armor-piercing, fear-mongering, the-gang-bangers-and-terrorists-are-coming-for-your-children-and-the-government-is-coming-for-your-guns call to arms for which he has become famous. By the end of his relatively lengthy address, Pierre had drawn a straight line between supporting the NRA and loving freedom. “Joining the NRA,” he told the crowd, “is how you resist. It's how you tell the world that you're going to fight and you're going to protect everything you care about: trust, honor, dignity, civic duty, courtesy, kindness, the liberty to live our lives and believe as we choose, to be as accepted as we are accepting of others, freedom that only comes through the second amendment and the Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution!” Then he made everyone stand up who wants to save this country and fight for freedom. If only Charlton Heston had been there to shriek something about overthrowing our ape overlords.
Finally, there was the Donald—who was vastly less overwrought than LaPierre but also vastly less coherent. Trump started off babbling about all the celebs he'd just been hob-nobbing with down at his Miami hotel that morning. Next thing you know, he's talking about how much Vladmir Putin respects him. How do we know this? Because Putin gave the Donald a present when they were hanging out in conjunction with The Miss Universe pageant, which Trump owns. You know who else really respects Trump? The Chinese. Trump has lots of rich Chinese pals, and they just love him. Plus, Business Week asked some question about the Top 10 things the Chinese want, and you know what they said? Trump stuff. Ties. Hotels. Apartments. Anything with his name on it. They're crazy for the brand. The biggest bank in China is a tenant in one of Trump's buildings, and they tell him, “We'll never leave! We love you! We love the building!” Why? Because they respect Trump. Unlike that Obama schmuck, who they regard as a total loser. (How many hotels does Obama own? Zero! How many reality shows has he starred in? Zero.) And don't even get Trump started on immigration or Afghanistan or how America should have seized Iraq's oil after kicking Saddam's ass.
Yep. After a relatively slow morning, La Pierre and Trump were the political equivalent of that moment at the wedding when the maid of honor slaps the best man, throws up on the groom's grandma, and passes out in the punch fountain with her dress hiked up around her waist. Which is why, no matter how much abuse we take at CPAC, we the media just cannot stay away.
Lowest-graded player at every position in NFL Week 16
By Bryson Vesnaver • Dec 27, 2016
Last weekend saw games on four separate days, giving everyone a big holiday of football. Now that Week 16 is in the books, we've got just one final week left to decide the NFL regular season. Some players will play great. Others will not. Every week we highlight the lowest-graded players at every position. This past holiday weekend, there were a fair few.
Week 16 offense
Quarterback: Trevor Siemian, Denver Broncos, 33.6
Denver's season ended with a bit of a whimper on Sunday night, thanks largely in part to an offense that couldn't get nearly anything going. Siemian really struggled under pressure, completing just 2-of-12 passes for 20 yards on the day. When he looked deep he was rarely accurate, completing one pass beyond 20 yards downfield (a 26-yarder) in seven attempts, with one of them being intercepted.
Running back: Carlos Hyde, San Francisco 49ers, 47.9
While it was unfortunate to see Hyde go down with a sprained MCL (he was not downgraded for fumbling on that play), he had struggled up to that point. He had already fumbled once before, and had gained just 39 yards on 13 carries.
Wide receiver: DeAndre Hopkins, Houston Texans, 36.4
Hopkins was targeted just six times all game and caught three of them for 43 yards. He dropped a pass and also had two offensive pass interference penalties to go along with a false start.
Wide receiver: Mike Wallace, Baltimore Ravens, 43.8
Wallace saw seven targets in his game, and managed to haul in four of them but gained only 21 yards, with one of them being a 14-yarder alone. He also dropped two passes.
Slot receiver: Seth Roberts, Oakland Raiders, 48.0
Roberts was mostly a ghost for the Raiders on Saturday. Despite 51 snaps and four targets, Roberts had zero catches.
Tight end: Will Tye, New York Giants, 38.5
Tye was nothing special in the receiving game, catching five passes for just 23 yards on eight targets. But he also struggled as a blocker, finishing with a 30.1 run-blocking grade.
Left tackle: George Fant, Seattle Seahawks, 27.9
Fant has had as tough a year as any tackle in professional football, and it continued last week. He allowed two sacks and seven quarterback hurries, while also posting just a 29.3 run-block grade.
Left guard: Tyler Shatley, Jacksonville Jaguars, 33.2
It was a tough day in pass protection for Shatley, who allowed a hit and four quarterback hurries. He also had a few other plays where he was cleanly beaten.
Center: Zane Beadles, San Francisco 49ers, 33.0
Almost all Beadles struggles came in the run game, as he actually didn't allow a pressure in pass protection. But he allowed six run stops in the run game on top of multiple other disruption plays. He also had three penalties.
Right guard: Joshua Garnett, San Francisco 49ers, 41.1
Garnett joins his teammate Beadles on the list after allowing four quarterback hurries in pass protection, as well as multiple disruptive plays when he was run blocking.
Right tackle: John Theus, San Francisco 49ers, 27.5
By this point it's clear that the 49ers offensive line struggled mightily. Theus himself allowed a quarterback hit and six additional hurries. He also allowed eight run stops and had a false start and tripping penalty.
Week 16 defense
Edge defender: DaVonte Lambert, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 33.8
In 57 defensive snaps, Lambert didn't record a single pressure. He didn't make a single run stop and finished with just two tackles. He missed a tackle as well.
Interior defender: Grady Jarrett, Atlanta Falcons, 35.5
Jarrett had a quarterback hit and two late pressures, but failed to make a single stop in the run game. He was a big reason the Panthers averaged 5.2 yards per rush.
Interior defender: Star Lotulelei, Carolina Panthers, 36.0
The Panthers defense had even less success stopping the run against the Falcons, allowing 6.3 yards per rush. Lotulelei was a big factor, as he made just one solo stop all game.
Edge defender: Erik Walden, Indianapolis Colts, 35.5
Similarly to Lambert, Walden didn't record a single pressure in 54 snaps. He had just one solo tackle and one assist, while missing a tackle.
Linebacker: Craig Robertson, New Orleans Saints, 27.0
Robertson struggled in coverage, allowing all four targets he saw to be caught for 39 yards and a touchdown. In the run game he made just one solo stop while missing three tackles.
Linebacker: Ryan Shazier, Pittsburgh Steelers, 29.5
Shazier also had a really tough time in coverage, allowing 8-of-10 targets to be caught for 84 yards and a touchdown. He did have an interception, although he missed two tackles on the day as well.
Cornerback: Tracy Porter, Chicago Bears, 19.4
Porter allowed just five catches on seven targets, which doesn't seem like it would equate to such a low grade. But those five catches went for 160 yards, with 71 of them coming after the catch. Porter was also beaten badly on the other two targets, and was bailed out by a bad throw. He also took a pass interference penalty.
Cornerback: Brandon Williams, Arizona Cardinals, 33.1
The Seahawks decided they were going to pick on Williams, and they did just that to the tune of 18 targets. He allowed 11 of them to be caught for 163 yards and two touchdowns.
Slot corner: T.J. Carrie, Oakland Raiders, 32.5
Carrie in the slot allowed three catches on five targets for 86 yards. He was beaten on both of the other incompletions as well.
Safety: Darian Stewart, Denver Broncos, 28.7
Stewart definitely struggled in coverage, allowing five of six targets to be caught for 35 yards and a touchdown. But he missed four tackles on the day and had a run-defense grade of just 23.6, lowest among defensive backs.
Safety: T.J. Green, Indianapolis Colts, 37.6
Green was okay in the run defense game but struggled in coverage. He allowed three catches on three targets as the primary coverage man for 38 yards and a touchdown, while also having issues with his over-the-top help.
Week 16 special teams
Punter: Jeff Locke, Minnesota Vikings
Locke punted five times and averaged just 37.2 yards per punt. He didn't land any inside the 20-yard line and his net average of 29.2 yards was the lowest of the week.
Kicker: Dan Carpenter, Buffalo Bills
Carpenter not only missed a 46-yard field goal early in the game, but he missed a 45-yarder in overtime that could've won the Bills the game.
Kick returner: Tavon Austin, Los Angeles Rams
Austin returned five punts and gained just 13 yards total, including one in which he fumbled
"They have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and unlawful threats," said Lars Byström at Stockholm police.
The three were taken into questioning on Friday and were formally arrested later in the evening.
Lars Byström declined to comment on media reports that the three were linked to neo-Nazi group the Swedish Resistance Movement (Svenska motståndsrörelsen - SMR).
"I can confirm that a police operation has been conducted near the Expressen office building, but I also want to be clear that all attempts to threaten and commit violence against Expressen and other media merely results in more journalism," he said.
Expressen, whose offices in the same building as Dagens Nyheter, has published a series of articles on the Swedish Resistance Movement and the Party of the Swedes (Svenskarnas parti) in the course of the past week.
"Since 1944 it has been our mission and conforms with our idea of journalism to bring attention to xenophobia," Expressen's editor-in-chief Thomas Mattsson said in a comment to the TT news agency.
The Swedish Resistance Movement is recognised as one of the key members of the white power movement in Sweden and their publication material openly praises the life of Adolf Hitler.
Four of the group's members were jailed in June 2014 for their part in the clashes in Stockholm suburb Kärrtorp in December 2013.
The new, 60-unit Lotus Garden apartments are set on a steep hill in Chinatown, which provided a parking garage challenge for developer Affirmed Housing Group--the low-income developer couldn't build completely underground, so they ended up adding a Carmatrix, a semi-automated parking garage that parks more cars in less space. Drivers cruise into a stall, punch a number or swipe a card, exit the car, and the vehicle is moved to an open space above, below, or adjacent to the stall. When you need to grab your car, you punch in the parking spot in a keypad and the vehicle is retrieved (a video demonstration below shows a slowish vehicle return, but a Carmatrix official says it won't take longer than three minutes at most--often quicker than trudging through a multi-level garage).
The Carmatrix penciled out to $17,000 per stall, not much more or less than a typical parking spot in an apartment building. The savings are in space, which for this city of hideous parking podiums and subterranean garages that tickle China, seems significant (WeHo already has plans to build one and there's one in Santa Monica). City officials are apparently not too well-versed in these new-fangled garages and approvals took forever, but less technologically-challenged cities like Portland and New York are snapping them up.

· For Parking, Chinatown Building Enters the Matrix [DN]
Economic growth for those in the bottom half of the income distribution in the United States has stalled since the 1970s, but it's going gangbusters for those on the upper rungs, according to new research.
UC Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman joined French Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics to tap tax, survey and national accounts data in order to produce a working paper posted today by the National Bureau of Economic Growth that shows:
The average pre-tax income of adults in the bottom 50 percent income share in the U.S. has stagnated since 1980.
The bottom 50 percents share of income share has collapsed from about 20 percent in 1980 to 12 percent in 2014.
Between the early 1980s and 2014, the average pre-tax income of the top 1 percent of adults rose from $420,000 to about $1.3 million, and their income share increased from about 12 percent.
In 1980, the top 1 percent adults earned on average 27 times more than bottom 50 percent adults, while they earn 81 times more today.
The share of women falls sharply as one moves up the income ladder, with only 11 percent in the top 1 percent today.
There has been close to zero growth for working-age adults in the bottom 50 percent of the distribution since 1980.
In the bottom half of the distribution range, only income for the elderly is rising, while income has fallen for those under the age of 65.
“The top 1 percent income share is now almost twice as large as the bottom 50 percent share, a group that is by definition 50 times more numerous,” write Saez, Zucman and Piketty, who are co-directors of the World Wealth and Income Database.
To address the inequities they are documenting through their combination of tax, survey and national account data that captures 100 percent of national income, the economists suggest that officials consider improving education and access to skills, reforming labor market institutions to boost workers' bargaining power, and instituting a higher minimum wage.

Worshipers of the great God of civilisation – Technology – are destroying the planet and the life forms – human and non-human, flora and fauna – that inhabit this little ball of rock in the Milky Way galaxy. They will reduce this once thriving, living, biotic-community to a dystopian nothingness akin to that of cyber-punk science fiction.
Many might claim it's unfair to characterise the techno-utopian vision as a suicide cult. Many readers will be thinking – “how can we save the planet without new technology?” Bear with me…
Scientism
Karl Marx described religion as the opiate of the masses, as it dulled their senses and kept them passive and accepting of the alienation of capitalist, industrialist culture. This idea has been embraced by atheists seeking to demonize religion as the principle cause of all the world's ills. But it has long become apparent to those critical of Enlightenment philosophies that the cult(ure) of Scientism – epitomised through contemporary digital-techno-culture – is the new religion of the day, the opiate of the masses.
The father of much of modern psychology, Freud, provided a similar description of religion. Freud argued religion served to repress and sublimate individual desire into activities that serve the culture. This, he argued, produces neurosis and mental illness in those that civilisation seeks to domesticate. This appears obviously true to those of us who share a green anarchist/radical environmentalist/anti-civ perspective.
The narcotic opium works through mimicking the effects of the endorphins our bodies produce to manage pain and create feelings of calm and well-being. This is exactly what technology is meant to do – manage pain and create sensations of calm and well-being. It's what existentialist philosopher Martin Heidegger termed inauthenticity.
When undergoing the sensations of opium we forget about the Real natural world, where we are mortal animal beings, fighting to survive. We are inauthentic. The drug distances our perceptions from these aspects of Being. Technology works the same way as religion, distracting us from our deaths with feelings of invincibility and immortality.
Virtual “Reality”?
In the “Be Right Back” episode of the TV series Black Mirror, the character Martha uses a service that simulates her dead husband through his social media profiles – this starts off as just a voice simulator and culminates in a totalising robotic unfulfilling replacement, resulting in conflicting emotions for her, where she is unable to either live with or without the artificial husband she has forged a relationship with.
Is this not the relationship we have with technology in this contemporary culture? This culture seems defined by these attempts to remain immortal through social media, hating it at all moments because of what it does to our lives, but unable to escape the spectacle of media, memes, video clips, hashtags and selfies. This is inauthenticity.
Japan is undergoing a bizarre cultural phenomenon in which people are no longer seeking sexual relations – the most intimate and wildly natural aspect left to us within domestication. As a replacement, thousands of men are a playing a video game that simulates a girlfriend. Websites like invisiblegirlfriend.com and karigirl.com provide virtual girlfriends, propagating the notion that a relationship with a woman is an act of pure consumption for the pleasure of men. There is no physicality to these relationships – no contact, no risk, nothing… an emptiness, an abyss.
Bank of America analysts and SpaceX founder Elon Musk have made the claim that the world around us is probably a virtual reality. This is an extension of the solipsistic, brain-in-jar, Matrix-type of argument that says the world outside of the self is unknowable.
This solipsistic position can only exist as a problem within the language-based modes of acquiring truth of this culture. This is because language functions as a technology that acts as a substitute for the relevant “Thing” and is designed to created auditory and Symbolic pictures of the Real. Within civilisation, especially digital-techno-industrial-civilisation, the self exists as an object of language, as a transcendental entity, always out of reach.
This is what religions do – including atheistic ones like Humanism and its sibling Scientism – they tie our self-hoods to stuff that exists purely in language: God, society, the soul, manifest destiny. They exist as what Max Stirner called “spooks.” They started with civilisation – agrarian, non-hunter-gather, ways of life – and its need to create socially-normative moral narratives for sedentary life, from Gilgamesh deforesting the cedar forests of Mesopotamia all the way to the nightmarish acts of ecocide that are the business-as-usual of this culture.
The solipsist myth is the easiest myth to dispel though, for one simple reason – we all have primal, animal, intimate, existential relationships with our bodies, which require no mediator to attain. Lovers of Nietzsche will know this as “the return to the body.” We know the world through our bodies and the dances we partake in upon the landscapes we find ourselves on. Our physicality is immediately apparent through our lives.
To quote Sartre, “The body is the totality of meaningful relations to the world. In this sense it is defined also by reference to the air which it breathes, to the water which it drinks, to the food which it eats. The body in face could not appear without sustaining meaningful relations to the totality of what is.”
It is for this reason that grounding our selves outside all of the aforementioned technologies is of utmost importance for those of us who desire a livable biosphere. If our self-hoods are based in the technological substitutes of language, we won't fight for the Real natural world that our lives are actually dependent on.
Is colonizing Mars the solution to trashing our own planet?
For evidence of this we need not look further than our friend Elon Musk again, with his plans to “make life interplanetary.” He intends to send a vessel carrying 100 individuals to Mars by 2022, in order to start a colony there. Mars would function as a technological replacement for Earth – our planet, our home, the geographical location in which all our meaningful relationships that produce our Real selves are based. Some might say that humans have always expanded their boundaries of where they live. This is just false. This culture, this civilisation, that now spans the entire globe has used the violence of colonisation since its birth and is now continuing this expansion through inter-planetary colonialism.
The lives of the colonists are not based in the Real self that is grounded in the world, but in the language-based, technological-narrative of the act of exploration for civilisation – manifest destiny. The same cult(ure), different God.
Some might say that this is simply the continuation of mankind triumphing over nature. This is again false. Mankind hasn't triumphed over nature, as every tsunami, hurricane, tornado, flash flood or blizzard brought on by climate change, termite colony or Japanese knotweed destroying a house, weasel taking out hadron colliders, or mold growing on 5-day-old dinner plates in teenagers' bedrooms is seeking to prove.
How about this for another example: Prophet of Scientism Stephen Hawking recently made the claim that if we do not go to space the “human race” (whatever the fuck that means) has no future. Rather than question the relentless continuation of scientific “progress,” industrialism, techno-modernity, and the destruction of the biosphere that is producing the mass extinction event and ecological crisis we are living in, Hawking – supposedly one of the greatest minds alive today – continues down the same narrative. This might be somewhat influenced by his own obvious requirements regarding technology, and as such it feels harsh to criticise the guy too much, but this cultish attachment is obviously suicidal.
I'm sorry Mr. Hawking, but humanity doesn't have a future if we continue down this path to self-destruction, and Mars does not present a sufficient substitute (as if one were possible outside of Scientism's mythologies) for this planet. We are Earthlings. Our Being is tied to this world that we are dependent on.
This forgetting of our Self and natural Being – what Daniel Quinn calls the great forgetting – can be immediately overcome within consciousness, which makes it so much easier to reclaim those aspects outside of our internal-psychological worlds. This can be found immediately within acts that are primal to our Being, like making love or walking through spaces where non-domesticated communities still reside. It can be found through creative and destructive acts (which are actually the same thing) that challenge this culture and its violence.
We know that civilisation is the cause of mental health issues, such as depression, and that this is at its most severe within digital-techno-industrial-civilisation. These acts are deconstructive, iconoclastic, freeing, liberating, feral and rewilding. They return us to the purest aspects of our Being. They kill the techno-utopian “God” within our psychic worlds, freeing us to do do the work to halt its relentless destruction and support the living wild world.

It's a Saturday and you're on vacation, looking out over the beautiful blue Pacific Ocean from the windy cliffs of Big Sur. You breathe in cool, fresh salty air. A thunderous pummel of great waves stirs neural networks in your brain and suddenly you find yourself wondering what lies submerged beneath the foaming sea. Seals playing among beds of kelp? Sharks prowling for a kill? Creatures yet to be discovered?
Exploring beyond what meets the eye has fueled human inventiveness for thousands of years. In recent decades, technology has provided us with unique tools that inspire questions our forefathers could not even begin to imagine.
Consider the brain. A mere 200 years ago, we did not know that it was made of neurons. Without this knowledge, it would be impossible to realize that these cells connect through synapses to form networks and communicate by electrical and chemical signals. The neural doctrine, as it's called, leads to avalanches of discoveries. One such is plasticity, a neuron's ability to modify its connections over time. A few decades ago it was widely thought plasticity was exhibited by developing brains and not in adults. But advances in neurotech that allow us to see beyond the surface and venture deep within a living brain disrupted this conception. Researchers now realize that adult brains are highly adaptive to experience and regularly grow new synapses over time.
One integral tool facilitating our ability to track these changes is multiphoton microscopy. It works by shining infrared radiation through tissue, where it is absorbed by fluorescent proteins that have been genetically added to cells. Sensors pick up the emitted fluorescent light and plot the location of fluorescing cells. By directing radiation to focal points at different depths, scientists can chart 3D structure. Repeating this technique over days and weeks allows the identification and monitoring of the wiring remodeling dynamics in the living brain.
Seeing subtle neuron rewiring exposes synaptic motility in the brain that was previously unknown. Neurons are not static; spine-like projections in the cortex grow and recede throughout an animal's life. We can use this technology to detect a wide variety of brain dynamics, such as how synapse growth changes in Alzheimer's or how cocaine use impacts brain vasculature. Other researchers recently used two-photon microscopy to discover that brain cells shrink by 60 percent during sleep and are washed in cerebrospinal fluid to remove toxic metabolic byproducts from the day.
We cannot truly understand what we cannot measure. Scientists are beginning to see how external experience is reflected by changes in neural arborization thanks to our ability to map these connections in vivo. This is but the tip of the iceberg. Combining multiphoton microscopy with other neurotechnologies such as optogenetics and electron microscopy stands to reveal ever more details of the brain's enterprising neural networks. Ralph Waldo Emerson might well have been an observing neuroscientist when he wrote that “what lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside of you.”
Tune in next week when we explore how high density electrophysiology allows researchers to track the firing of hundreds of cells to understand how coordinated cellular activity can result in behavior and environmental awareness.
Editor's note: This is the second installment in a series about emerging neurotechnologies. Join a pilot class of 12 PhD students at MIT as we explore how neuroscience is revolutionizing our understanding of the brain. Each post coincides with a lecture and lab tour at MIT created by the Center for Neurobiological Engineering. This experiment is supported by MITx and created by EyeWire.
Larry McReynolds is the guy to turn to for expert NASCAR analysis. Having worked in the booth for NASCAR on FOX for the last 16 seasons – and before then as a crew chief since the mid-1980s – Larry has seen the sport change massively. He spoke with me to share some memories from his career, as well looking ahead to the future for the NASCAR Monster Energy Cup Series in 2017 and beyond.
Why should Brits tune into the upcoming Daytona 500?
To me, all motorsport events are exciting. But when you think about 40 drivers, in 40 race cars, running around a high banked 2.5-mile racetrack for 500 miles, sometimes 3 wide for 6 or 7 rows, knowing one little slip by one driver, can take out a dozen or so others, it ramps up the tension.
You look at how unpredictable this race has become and how close the finishes have been. Last year, Denny Hamlin beat Martin Truex Jr by basically the length of a front bumper, thousands of a second, after 500 miles. In the last 10 Daytona 500s, we've had 9 different winners. It's like a 200 miles per hour chess match.
We do things a little backwards, whilst most sports have their biggest event at the end of the season, the NASCAR season pretty much kicks off with it's biggest race.
What are your favourite memories from your time covering NASCAR on FOX?
A lot of my most memorable moments come from the Daytona 500. I look back to 2007, when Mark Martin, trying to win his first 500, almost had a drag race with Kevin Harvick from turn 4 back to finish line – Harvick beating him by just a few inches. Behind them we had cars crashing all the way to the line. Clint Bowyer actually finished the race upside down!
I recall last year, where we had 3 or 4 lead changes on the final lap and also, it was memorable for many reasons, but the 2001 Daytona 500, our first broadcast on FOX stands out. Our first day on the job saw Michael Waltrip get his first ever Cup Series win, with his brother Darrell calling the final lap. But unfortunately, a memory we would like to forget is that Michael's car owner, and the guy I won the 1998 Daytona 500 with, Dale Earnhardt, lost his life in a turn 4 crash on that lap.
Before FOX, you worked with several NASCAR greats including Dale Earnhardt and Davey Allison. What do miss most from working on the pit box?
I do miss it. I was there for essentially 18 years. Winning the Daytona 500 with Davey Allison in 1992 and then coming back 6 years later and winning with Dale Earnhardt stands out, but I never won a championship. I came really close a couple of times and that's a little bit of a void.
But I walk by those two trophies in my office every single day and grin. If you ever win the 500 as a driver or a crew chief or even a tyre changer, it doesn't stay with you the rest of the year, or the rest of your career, it stays with you for the rest of your life. Even now, I still get introduced as a 2-time Daytona 500 winning crew chief and to know that was those two drivers' only 500 wins – unfortunately that neither of them are with us today – makes it even more special.
2017 sees the introduction of the new segment format in races. How do you think this will affect strategy throughout the season?
I know sometimes we get scared of change. We're creatures of habit and that makes change a little bit scary. But I have dissected these changes for 2017 left, right, up and down, and I can't see anything but good coming out of it. I want to give it a few races, because it truly is different. We can't lose sight of the fact it's still a race, with pit stop strategy, and there's still going to be a guy in Victory Lane at the end of the day who wins the trophy.
With these stages now, we have two known caution periods. The crew chiefs can plan on that, it's not like the race is going to stop, it's just that they're going to throw a caution, at those two set points in the race, and drivers running in the top 10 are going to receive some points.
The biggest thing we anticipate that this is going to do, I don't like the phrase “make the drivers race harder”, I don't think you can ask them to race harder than they do now, but I think they will race differently, that will provide more excitement in the early stages of the race compared to before where things when into a bit of a lull as the laps wound down.
With that in mind, and considering the reduction in downforce for 2017, which teams and drivers do you see adapting to the changes best?
Of course, you never know until you get out there and start racing, but the new aerodynamic rules don't come in until race 2 at Atlanta. The aero at Daytona and Talladega, the two restrictor plate tracks, will be the same as last year. So, we have to wait until Atlanta, Vegas, Phoenix and Auto Club to really know, but it just seems that, if I go off past history, the teams and drivers that seem to adapt quickest to change are the Joe Gibbs Racing Toyotas, especially Kyle Busch.
Of course, I don't think you can ever take your eye off Jimmie Johnson and that 48 team, who won their 7th championship last year. I would almost want to add Kevin Harvick and the 4 car into the mix, but the other thing that they have to deal with, as well as the aero changes, is the change for 2017 from Chevrolet to Ford. They have even more changes going on, so the jury is out on them a little bit, depending on how quickly they pick up and move on with the change in engine manufacturer as well.
How do you see Monster Energy changing the sport over the next few years?
As I said, change can be scary, and Monster Energy, in the 60+ year history of the NASCAR Cup Series, are only our 3rd series sponsor. I guess, knowing the history of Monster Energy, that they are used to and very familiar with motorsport, that it's going to bring some new attention to our sport. It'll maybe do what we've been trying to accomplish and get some of the younger generation involved in our sport.
It seems like everything they've ever done in motorsport has truly been successful, and ramped up popularity. So I'd like to think the same thing will happen with the Cup Series.
If Lewis Hamilton left F1 to try NASCAR for a year, how do you think he'd fare?
You would think with how talented a driver he is, that he would come over here and do well. But all I can do is base things off past history. There have been a lot of open-wheel guys that have come our way, and not been successful.
You look at [Juan Pablo] Montoya, a 2-time Indy 500 winner, 7-time Grand Prix winner, pretty much competitive in everything he ever did. I won't say he wasn't competitive over here, he won a couple of road course races, but I think he found it more challenging, from a competition standpoint, than what he was used to.
You look at drivers not just from Formula One, but open-wheel, that came over here and found things to be a bit of a challenge. These cars don't have a lot of downforce, the power-to-weight ratio is much greater, they don't stop very well.
I wouldn't be dumb enough to say that he would not come over here and do well, but I do think he would find it quite the challenge.
Fox continues to be the network to tune into to see NASCAR racing, what can we expect from you and the team over the next few months?
We never stop working on new things. We try to be careful not to reinvent the wheel with our broadcast from one year to the next, because we feel like we have a solid broadcast as it is. However, at the same time, we know we can't just sit still and wait on the next season to come.
I've been working feverishly, especially over the last 3 to 4 months, on our virtual cutaway car, adding a lot of new items and elements to it. We've been working on a lot of new aero animations, to be able to tell the story of this low-downforce aero package that we'll be racing with from Atlanta.
We try to fine tune things, including bringing better pictures and better sound to the viewer at home. So we're pretty excited to get started.
Finally, who is your tip to win the Daytona 500 and the 2017 Monster Energy Cup?
I'd almost feel better telling you what number to pick on a roulette wheel! As I said earlier, that's how unpredictable the Daytona 500 has become. You can have the fastest, best handling car, perfect pit stops, the best strategy, and as was the case in 2007, the outcome of your day could be decided between turn 4 and the chequered flag.
I guess, if I look back on the 4 restrictor plate races from last year, I'll go with a guy who is yet to win a Daytona 500. He won 2 of those races in 2016, including the Daytona race in July and that's Brad Keselowski in the Penske Ford.
As far as the championship is concerned, that's almost as tough as picking the Daytona 500 winner, with the new race format and the playoffs and the elimination races at the end. I'm going to say Jimmie Johnson will go back to back and get his 8th Cup championship, something that nobody else has ever accomplished.
A recent multi-year study of German gamers might cast doubt on the idea that sexist content in video games can affect sexist attitudes in gamers. But the researchers behind the study caution that their findings shouldn't be oversimplified.
“There are often discrepancies between what a study actually found and how people interpret it,” the two lead researchers, Johannes Breuer and Rachel Kowert told me in an e-mail interview this week after I contacted them about their 824-person study which compared gamers' and non-gamers' responses to a trio of questions about women's place in society over the course of two years.
“We found that the amount of overall video game use at time 1 was not predictive of sexist attitudes/beliefs about gender roles at time 2 (i.e., 2 years later) and that (sexist) beliefs about gender roles at time 1 were equally not predictive of video game use at time 2 (for sample of German players aged 14 and older).
“Some people seem to think that this is proof that sexism is not an issue in games and gaming culture, which is something that we neither found, nor say (nor examined, really) in our study.”
The researchers would go on to tell me that they think sexism in gaming is still a potential problem in terms of excluding female gamers, influencing thoughts about body image and other factors. They also suggested that people might overestimate the impact that games have on people while underestimating the impact that gamers may have on each other.

Breuer and Kowert's work had caught my eye last week, first from the press and social media attention the release of their study got and then from Kowert's reaction to that attention on her website.
I saw claims from the usual Gamergate quarters that this disproved anything gaming's feminist critics have said about games. And I saw claims that this research surely had to be flawed or didn't apply because of the age and nationality of the people studied or because it was too general. And so on..

The study is called “Sexist Games=Sexist Gamers? A Longitudinal Study on the Relationship Between Video Game Use and Sexist Attitudes.” (Longitudinal means it was done over an extended period of time, rather than a cross-sectional study that'd be taking one statistical snapshot). A summary of the study laid out both the context for the research and the key finding, bolded by me for emphasis:
From the oversexualized characters in fighting games, such as Dead or Alive or Ninja Gaiden, to the overuse of the damsel in distress trope in popular titles, such as the Super Mario series, the under- and misrepresentation of females in video games has been well documented in several content analyses. Cultivation theory suggests that long-term exposure to media content can affect perceptions of social realities in a way that they become more similar to the representations in the media and, in turn, impact one's beliefs and attitudes. Previous studies on video games and cultivation have often been cross-sectional or experimental, and the limited longitudinal work in this area has only considered time intervals of up to 1 month. Additionally, previous work in this area has focused on the effects of violent content and relied on self-selected or convenience samples composed mostly of adolescents or college students. Enlisting a 3 year longitudinal design, the present study assessed the relationship between video game use and sexist attitudes, using data from a representative sample of German players aged 14 and older (N = 824). Controlling for age and education, it was found that sexist attitudes— measured with a brief scale assessing beliefs about gender roles in society—were not related to the amount of daily video game use or preference for specific genres for both female and male players. Implications for research on sexism in video games and cultivation effects of video games in general are discussed.
Later in the week, here's what Kowert wrote on her blog:
This article has received quite a bit of buzz from the press and Twitter, as some believe that this study is evidence that sexism is not a problem within the gaming culture. This could not be further from the point. As described by succinctly by Wai Yen Tang of the VG researcher blog: “this study is analogous of taking photographs from a tall skyscraper down into the streets at three different time periods. You get a beautiful view of a lot of things, but not very clear if you try to focus on a single thing. This means we need a high resolution camera focusing on the most relevant aspects for sexist attitudes.”

There's a continuum for this research. Scientists have studied the potential effects of games on gamers for many years, though they've primarily focused on the question of whether violent games make kids violent.
In 2010, the State of California tried to convince the U.S. Supreme Court that the research was there to justify banning the sale of games to kids, treating games less like art and more like alcohol and tobacco. The court was unconvinced and the preponderance of video game violence studies have not found any strong evidence that playing violent video games will make you more violent.
The arguments about the impact of sexism in games—be it sexist imagery, sexist interactions, and so on—has been more complicated and subtler. Sure, some people may think that simply playing games makes you more sexist, but you'll see plenty of other arguments: that sexist content can alienate some girls and women from even playing games, may reinforce negative societal values or may simply result in less interesting games and game stories.

To make things even a shade more confusing, Breuer and Kowert had noted that their own study might appear to conflict with some other gaming and sexism studies, though there are key differences among the research. In their own paper, they wrote of their results:
“These findings conflict with the results of previous cross-sectional and experimental work that found some evidence for links between sexist video game content and benevolent sexism and tolerance for sexual harassment. However, these studies were either cross-sectional or looked at short-term effects. They also focused on very specific games and types of sexism, whereas the present study was longitudinal and looked at general beliefs about gender roles in society and overall use of video games. Both the design of the current study and its main findings are more in line with previous cultivation studies on violence in video games that found no or only very limited evidence for cultivation effects.”
So what to make of this new study and how it fits into these arguments? I e-mailed Breuer and Kowert to get their take. This is what we discussed:
Stephen Totilo, Kotaku: What arguments would you say the study is debunking? Rachel Kowert (Dept. of Communication, University of Munster) and Johannes Breuer (Dept of Psychology, University of Cologne): We would be careful in saying that the study debunks any arguments. It provides some evidence that there are no broad cultivation effects of games, meaning that video games alone do not make anyone (more) sexist (in terms of endorsing traditional gender roles; see also our comment about the quote above). Totilo: What arguments are it not debunking? Kowert and Breuer: Again, we would probably not say “debunk” here. However, we want to make clear that our study does not show that sexism is not an issue in/for games and gaming culture. There are many content analyses of popular games that show that female characters are underrepresented or presented in an overly sexualized manner and there is also ample evidence that many players, particularly female, have experienced sexism in their interactions with other players. Totilo: What impact do you think sexism in games actually has on gamers? Kowert and Breuer: At the very least, we would say that it can be off-putting to many players (especially female players) and, therefore, can cause exclusion. While sexist game content can sometimes just be ignored or players can choose to turn to other games, personal experiences with sexual harassment or strong (sexist) insults by other players can have a serious negative impact on players, such as emotional distress. Over time, it can also drive players away from certain games or gaming altogether. Totilo: Maybe even more fundamentally, what actually do you even consider to be examples of sexism in games? Kowert and Breuer: As we said before, there are two main levels on which sexism can happen: in the content of a game (e.g., hypersexualized representations of female characters, such as the infamous “jiggle physics” in Ninja Gaiden) and in the interactions with other players. The latter can be expressed in various ways, such as exclusion, active discrimination, and/or active harassment (such as those documented on the aforementioned websites; e.g., Fat, Ugly, & Slutty) Totilo: What do you make of people who are comparing both the arguments and studies regarding the impact of video game violence on gamers to research about the depiction of women in video games on gamers? Are they the same thing? Fundamentally different? Kowert and Breuer: We would say that there are parallels here: In both cases, people seem to overestimate the effects of video game content. There are other, much more influential factors that impact aggression and sexism - most notably, family and peer influences. We would also say that for any kind of media effects research (e.g., sexism, violence/aggression, etc) we should be starting to focus on the interactions between players rather than the content of the games themselves. That is something that has already begun for research on aggression with studies, e.g., looking at differences between cooperative and competitive play (there is a really good article by ICA Game Studies Interest Group Chair James D. Ivory (Virginia Tech) about the need to focus more on interactions between players). Totilo: Do you plan to do more research on this topic? And, if so, what are you planning? Kowert and Breuer: This article came out of a larger panel study on the uses and effects of digital games in Germany, which ended in December 2014. Since then, the members of the team have moved on to new projects and jobs. As such, there is not much more that can be done in terms of this particular dataset and sample. Although, we have composed a theoretical article discussing the potential cyclical nature of sexism and exclusion in video games content and culture, which should be published in an edited volume later this year/early next year. We are also currently running a somewhat related project - a cross-cultural experimental study with partners from the US, Germany, and the Netherlands, assessing players' evaluation of “problematic” content in games (namely, violent and sexual content). The assumption here is that there are cultural differences in how violent and sexual content are perceived and evaluated and that personal moral views also play an important role in this process.

I'm intrigued by Breuer and Kowert's desire for people to study how players interact with each other. I look forward to seeing what researchers come up with.
What good is any one study? Depends on what you make of it, and, most likely, how much it conforms to your expectations. This new one adds to the discussion about how women are portrayed in video games. It both pushes against a certain model of cause and effect and exposes the limits of scientific study in a cultural debate. Even as it argues against gaming generally making people more sexist, it tells us nothing about, say, what gaming reflects about our society or how games influence how we think of women's bodies. There's certainly more to argue about. Lucky us!

Be suspicious, of course, of any simple conclusions—a handy motto to utter at least once a day.
Pity school careers advisers. If economists are to be believed, vast numbers of jobs will have evaporated by the time today's pupils reach the labour market. Oxford university's Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne say almost half of the jobs in the US are at high risk from computerisation in the next two decades, together with two-thirds of those in India and three-quarters in China.
While workers worry about whether robots will take their jobs, teachers are wondering how to use education to insulate the next generation from such a fate. This has worked before. When the last wave of automation swept the developed world at the start of the 20th century, policymakers decided education was the answer. If machines were going to substitute for brawn, they reasoned, more people would need to use their brains.
The US invested heavily in education, with good results. Workers reaped the benefits through better jobs and higher wages. Economists Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson summed it up like this: “The industrial revolution started a race between technology and education — and, for most of the 20th century, humans won that race.”
But the next race will be against technology that replaces brains and brawn. Machine learning algorithms are already starting to supplant the likes of mergers and acquisition bankers and currency traders. Some experts argue we need to respond with another fundamental rethink of education.
“School education has tended to focus on developing the core cognitive competences — for example, reading, writing and arithmetic,” said Andy Haldane, the Bank of England's chief economist, in a recent speech. “Smart machines have long since surpassed humans in their ability to do the first and third of these. And they are fast catching-up on the second. That begs the question of whether there are other skills where humans' comparative advantage is greater.”
So what skills should we teach our children to robot-proof their careers?
How to be creative
Artificial intelligence tends to solve problems methodically but the human brain is far better at making logical leaps of imagination. It is more intuitive, creative and better at persuasion. Humans can also combine their creativity with robot-surpassing dexterity to cut someone's hair, for example, or cook a delicious meal. “It's good to invest in creative education because these are some of the skills that should be left [after automation],” says Stian Westlake, head of policy and research at Nesta, the UK innovation charity.
Related article Financial survival in the era of automation The coming industrial age could create a new world of human work
When you start to look at the world like this, you turn some familiar tropes about global education on their head.
Mr Westlake says: “It's a paradoxical story where countries like the UK come out well, because our creative economy is quite strong. We beat ourselves up over our inability to be as good at Singapore and Shanghai at coding and things like this, but actually it turns out it's quite possible that sort of stuff is going to be the stuff that's very easy for artificial intelligence to automate.”
How to be nice
Some machines may have learnt how to seem caring but humans still have an unsurpassed ability to empathise with others. The new phrase is “EQ”, which stands for emotional quotient (or emotional intelligence). “The high-skill, high-pay jobs of the future may involve skills better measured by EQs than IQs, by jobs creating social as much as financial value,” the BOE's Mr Haldane said.
Whether or not such skills can be taught is an open question. Still, some organisations are giving it a go. ING, the Dutch bank, has recently put 350 staff through an “EQ training programme”. The aim is to teach these bankers how to “build trust with the client through asking lots more questions and listening out for feelings and beliefs as opposed to just listening out for content,” explains Steve Ellis, director at Rogensi, a consultancy that developed the project with ING.
One of the exercises involves sitting bankers in a room, showing them pictures of people's facial expressions and asking them to identify the emotion felt. Mark Pieter de Boer, head of financial market sales at ING, admits some bankers were initially resistant. “Typically, what you see is people who are very much IQ-focused struggle with making that change.”
But he says enthusiasm increased when staff saw the training had results. A survey by the company found people who had been on the course were more motivated, there was greater collaboration between departments and productivity increased by 10 per cent.
Remember the basics
Even if the promised age of artificial intelligence does arrive, experts say we cannot afford to dispense with hard cognitive skills such as reading, writing and mathematics.
From Special Reports Cybersecurity As companies and consumers wake up to the cyber threat, will they want to spend more on defending themselves? Continue reading
Daisy Christodoulou, research and development manager at the UK's Ark Schools chain, says that, unless we have these foundations in place, we will not have the mental frameworks to solve higher-order problems creatively.
“Even if we do arrive at a point where most work is done by computers, cognitive skills will still matter — not for the economy, but for the successful functioning of a democratic society,” she says. “In such a society, a great deal will turn on the ownership and regulation of the computers and robots doing all the work, and the debates around such issues will require an educated and informed populace.”

People with anxiety handle how they grapple with the disorder in different ways.
Some ignore it, others use medication, and still others seek out talk therapy.
12 Things Only People With Anxiety Can Teach You About Life
I have tried all three of those approaches and found that a combination of the second two are the most helpful.
That said, if you're a person with an anxiety disorder, you're not just going to magically be healed one day.
I manage my anxiety well, but I still get panic attacks and I still have anxious days. That just comes with the territory.
That's why, when I read that researchers have literally created A SONG that has reduced anxiety by 67% in everyone who listens to it, I basically went running for my headphones.
Researchers at MindLab in the UK teamed up with Marconi Union to create a song specifically designed to soothe and reduce stress.
The musicians teamed up with sound therapists to create music that would lower the heart rate, blood pressure, and actual cortisol (the hormone that causes stress) levels of the people listening to it.
The result is an eight-minute track called “Weightless” that the neuroscientists in charge of the program say is so effective that you SHOULD NOT listen to it while you drive.
As a person with a generalized anxiety disorder, I know how easy it is to feel isolated, desperate, and afraid.
If a song like this can take away some of that hurt, why not try it?
One thing I've discovered as I've begun to write more about anxiety and talk more about it on social media is that anxiety is more common than you might think, especially among people in Generation Y.
Why is this anxiety so common among me and my peers?
The answer is actually kind of surprising.
Researcher and writer Rachel Dove reported that more than half of all female university students report feeling anxiety, and in researching why, she found:
“The rise of technology, overly-protective parenting, and “exam-factory” schooling are among the reasons psychologists suggest for our generational angst. Another, brought up on multiple occasions by my peers and by psychologists I spoke to, is the luxury (as ungrateful as it sounds) of too much choice.”
It might sound silly, but it makes a lot of sense.
10 Quick Ways To Relax When You're Freaked Out And STRESSED Out
Life can be a lot easier when you don't have any choices to make.
Being given a multitude of options can be, well, deeply overwhelming.
Combine that with the pressures of “success,” whatever that means, and the fear of missing out on ANYTHING fun, perpetuated by social media, and you've got a perfect storm for anxiety.
You need to find the treatment that works best for you.
It doesn't matter if that treatment is a song, a pill, a long walk, or talking to your therapist for an hour or two every week.
Do what you need to do to feel as awesome as possible, because you ARE awesome, and just because your brain goes a little haywire sometimes that doesn't make you worth less than a person or be less cool to know.

Visitors to Germany's Wiesbaden Museum might be confused by what looks like a subversive new performance art installation. But the painting hung backwards isn't a Banksy pop-up or anything like that—it's German painter Hans von Marées' 19th century work, “Die Labung,” and the museum hung it backwards in a bid to raise money to buy it from its rightful Jewish owners. JTA reports that the museum, which was known as a “repository for art robbed from Jewish owners during the Third Reich,” is trying to locate the Jewish heirs of Nazi-looted art displayed in their museum, and either return the art or, more likely, buy it back from them.
According to JTA the museum needs to raise $118,000 by Nov. 5 to buy the painting from the Gerta Silberberg Discretionary Trust in Israel, the rightful heir to the entire art collection of Max Silberberg of Breslau, of which the von Marées is just one item. Or they could always, you know, just give it back.
It's an interesting approach—and there's certainly something to be said for the museum so publicly acknowledging the Nazi-looted items in its collection—though it seems like too little, too late. Plus, crowdsourcing the funding to buy the painting back seems like a tidy way to subvert the very real fact that the museum, which presumably charges admission, knowingly profited off of stolen artwork for nearly half a century now. It's also, regrettably, just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Nazi-looted art still in Germany.

'Some things were better under apartheid'
Millions of South Africans still live in shacks
When apartheid was dismantled in South Africa, many expected the lives of its black population would improve but promises of land distribution and new homes have not been fulfilled, as Hugh Sykes discovered. In a community of shacks on a hillside near Johannesburg, a man complained to me: "We didn't like apartheid, but some things were better under apartheid than they are now." In a community of shacks on a hillside near Durban, a man complained to me: "Life here under apartheid was bad, but now it is worse." I felt slightly unsettled hearing this. Shack dwellers have to go out to public stand-pipes to fill up containers with drinking water
It seemed like questioning a sacred belief - that apartheid was an unmitigated, 100% evil system. But there is less idolatry here now, as it dawns on most people that the new South Africa is still scarred by extreme poverty and high unemployment. No paradise Of course, Nelson Mandela continues to be lauded as the hero of the liberation of black South Africans from the oppressions of apartheid. Building houses for all under one programme proved too costly But he is also being criticised for changing the direction of the South African economy from active state intervention to neo-liberal, free-market economics. During his presidency, the government switched from RDP - the interventionist Reconstruction and Development Programme - to Gear, which stands for Growth, Employment And Redistribution. RDP promised paradise - clean water, mains drainage, land redistribution and a million homes - all in five years. But paradise did not come. The economy of South Africa simply could not bear the cost. So the finance system switched to Gear. Part of the thinking was that it would help to develop a substantial black middle class, whose taxes would then trickle down to the poor. The middle class did develop, but the problem with trickle-down is that it is just that - a trickle. Houses 'an insult' Millions of South Africans still live in shacks. The ANC government now is simply an extension of the apartheid government
"Bricks" Mokolo, former ANC activist Rain and dust get in, there is no security against burglars and shack dwellers have to go out to public stand-pipes to fill up containers with drinking water. And there is no proper lighting which - quite apart from the obvious inconveniences - makes it very hard for children to get their homework done on dark winter evenings. A former African National Congress activist, "Bricks" Mokolo, told me it is still very hard to criticise the government here. He says everybody has been, as he put it, "made to love the ANC, made to love Nelson Mandela" and "made to feel small" if they dare to complain. Mr Mokolo tells me angrily: "I didn't wait for Nelson Mandela. I too fought for my freedom. I was tortured in an apartheid jail." He was tortured so brutally that prison officers thought he was dead. After leaving him in a mortuary fridge overnight, they dumped what they thought was his dead body in a field. Mr Mokolo says that housing, especially, was better under apartheid than it is now. He calls the new houses that are being built all over the country an insult because they are significantly smaller than the old matchbox homes that the apartheid government built in the townships. "The ANC government now," he insists, "is simply an extension of the apartheid government. There's still separate development," he goes on, "there are still townships, 20 years after liberation." His conclusion: "There were places for blacks in those days. Now they are the same places. They've just changed the word. They've changed black, to poor." World Cup threat? This is a radical outlook that I have heard much more often than on previous visits. World Cup organisers have taken precautions after a wave of strikes A wave of strikes over the past few weeks is evidence of mounting frustration, despite the undeniable success of the growing black middle class in their smart homes and fast cars. "But what about us?" say the rubbish collectors who were on strike for 10 days in April, or the train and dockworkers who were out for more than two weeks this month. Mineworkers were about to go on strike, too, a few days ago and were only stopped by a court order. If they had stopped work, there could have been a threat to power supplies during the World Cup. All the same, stadiums are taking precautions, installing generators and back-up generators. This reminds me of the last World Cup, when I was in Baghdad - power cuts, blanked-out TV sets during some of the games. That surely cannot happen here, can it?

To read, listen to, or watch much Republican commentary today is to be told that President Obama is ruining the country. About Obama, it should be said up front that he's very much a failed president.
That said, for Republicans to say with such certainty that Obama is ruining the U.S. is for them to pay him quite the compliment. They should be a little bit more circumspect. The fortunes of countries rise and fall all the time.
China almost literally committed suicide after World War II with its rush into the murderous horrors of communism, and then England's post-war lurch toward socialism tragically impoverished a once great nation. But at present China is booming, and England too is alive with economic activity.
For Republicans to say that Obama is doing un-fixable damage to the U.S. is for them to ascribe otherworldly charisma and powers to him, and that plainly don't exist. Worse, they're saying that a less than impressive politician can in six years wreck the richest and most entrepreneurial nation ever formed. That's not likely, and it's an insult to Americans for Republicans to presume they're so weak as to let someone of Obama's ilk bring them down. If China can rebound from Mao, the U.S. can and will surely rebound from Obama.
Part of the Republican line about Obama is that he's imposed the biggest deficits in history on the U.S. Actually, he hasn't. Presidents per the Constitution can't spend money, rather Congress allocates funds. In that case, the Democrats controlled the purse from 2006 until 2010, but since then the Republican Party has managed spending. Democrats were notorious for labeling Ronald Reagan's relatively austere budgets as “Dead on Arrival,” so why don't the Republicans do the same to Obama, only in reverse?
And while deficits obscure the much bigger economic problem that is spending, the Republicans have been in control of Congress the majority of the time since 1994, including some years under a Republican president in George W. Bush. Where was the spending restraint then, and budget “surpluses,” when Bush was in office?
As for Obamacare, Republicans should be thanking President Obama every night for foisting this disaster on the nation. It's failing before our eyes due to its myriad contradictions, and in collapsing it's vividly exposing the fatal conceit of big government programs to voters. Obamacare is the best thing that ever happened to the freedom movement, so rather than bemoan this obnoxious bit of government overreach, Republicans should enjoy its implosion while talking loudly about how the federal government should have no role in the provision of healthcare in the first place.
Most comical of all, Republicans like to claim that Obama wouldn't be president today if he weren't black. If by that they mean that Americans are generous in spirit, that's fine. But it doesn't seem to be what many means. Instead, Republicans seem to be saying that absent Obama's skin color, the electorate would have put John McCain into the White House while revealing their preference for a continuation of Republican policies that had prevailed up to 2008. This is dangerous and rather foolhardy thinking.
The Republicans lost big in 2008 because the Party of Growth and entrepreneurial capitalism in the ‘80s had by the 2000s morphed into something quite different. Lest we forget, it was President Bush who signed the business-sapping Sarbanes-Oxley law (at the time he bragged it was the toughest anti-business “crime” law since the days of FDR), a McCain-Feingold bill that restricted free speech, and with a Republican Congress largely in control of the purse, it was Bush who never vetoed obnoxiously large budgets, not to mention his signing of a rather expensive prescription drug benefit.
It was also Bush who foisted on us a brutally cruel economic “blessing” in the form of Ben Bernanke, imposed tariffs on steel, shrimp and softwood lumber all the while bashing China, promoted with great gusto an economy-crushing devaluation of the dollar that authored an economy-strangling rush into the consumption of housing, and then when the markets revealed the horrors of Bush's policies with bank failures, rather than allow the capitalist system to fix his myriad errors, Bush, working with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Bernanke, decided to blame the markets for not working right such that they bailed out banks that the free markets had decided were not worth saving. In committing their egregious bailout errors Bush and Bernanke fostered a wholly unnecessary “financial crisis” that had nothing to do with capitalism, and everything to do with them running away from it. And in blocking the infinite and very curative wonders of the marketplace, they robbed our economy of a substantial recovery.
We don't suffer a presidency today that is an affront to good governance because of President Obama's ethnicity, rather we have a lousy president because the Republicans proved in the 2000s that they could easily match the Democrats when it came to obtuse policymaking. Until the Republicans realize this and acknowledge just how poorly their own party governed while in control, they won't be credible.
Of course, that's what's so concerning about their whining about Hillary Clinton. It says here that she won't run for president as is, and that if she does run she won't get the nomination, but it's been suggested on the right that Clinton will get the nomination, and that the mainstream media will give her a free pass in terms of coverage all the way to the White House.
Ok, it's probably fair to say that the mainstream media will be easier on her assuming she runs, but so what? As an aged USA Today piece by Peter Johnson noted about Ronald Reagan's campaign in 1984, coverage of him was over 90 percent negative. Despite this, the electorate wasn't fooled such that Reagan won 49 states out of 50; his success coming without Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, and all manner of alternative media sources that we enjoy today, and that tell us what the mainstream media does not.
To be blunt, if the Republicans can't field a candidate in 2016 to beat Hillary Clinton and all her baggage, or another Democratic Party candidate carrying the heavy weight of President Obama's numerous failings on his or her shoulders, they'll only have themselves to blame. Logic dictates a Republican victory in light of Obama's implosion, and if not, a logical answer for why will be the ongoing failure on the part of the GOP to look in the mirror, and wake up to the fact that the electorate got it right in firing an aimless, increasingly statist, and largely anti-growth party in 2006 and 2008.
The late great free-market columnist Warren Brookes long ago wrote that envy “is the single most impoverishing attitude of thought.” The Republicans thankfully aren't the Party of envy as their reliably dense competitors in the Democratic Party are, but as evidenced by all their wailing about President Obama and Hillary Clinton, their thinking is similarly impoverishing. Rather than spending so much time obsessing about their opponents, and elevating them in the process, they should rejoice in their failures that are discrediting big government with each passing day, and that will reward the Republicans if they develop a clue about how economies grow.

Once again, there is no love lost here (from our side anyway!).Thanks to everyone who bought one and keep dreaming!
"60 Minutes" issued a brief on-air apology and correction on Sunday for its botched and mishandled report on the Benghazi attacks, but gave few details about the failures that led to its retraction of a piece it had staunchly defended.
Speaking about Dylan Davies, the discredited man at the heart of her piece, correspondent Lara Logan told viewers, "We realized we had been misled, and it was a mistake to include him in our report. For that, we are very sorry."
The venerable program was forced into an embarrassing retreat after it had defended itself for a week about the reliability of Davies, a British security officer. On Thursday night, it emerged that Davies—who had already admitted to lying to a superior about his whereabouts on the night of the attack—had also told the FBI he had been nowhere near the American compound when it took place, a statement completely at odds with the detailed, harrowing tale he told "60 Minutes."
It was the second on-air apology delivered by Logan. On Friday, she went on television to say that she was "wrong" to have put Davies on air.
Predictably, her Sunday mea culpa offered little insight into why Davies was chosen as the key source for the report, and why "60 Minutes" had so fervently defended him, even amid mounting evidence of his unreliability. Also unmentioned was what role, if any, corporate ties played in placing Davies at the heart of the piece. A conservative imprint of Simon and Schuster, which is also owned by CBS, had published a book about Benghazi by Davies. That book has since been recalled.
Many media observers pronounced themselves to be less than impressed:

Fox News hosts Tucker Carlson, Anna Kooiman and Clayton Morris
The hosts of Fox & Friends asserted on Sunday that mass shootings could be prevented by banning “gun free zones” instead of passing the type gun safety laws that have worked in Australia.
During a segment about the massacre at Umpqua Community College, Fox News host Tucker Carlson praised Donald Trump for blaming the shooting on campus gun bans.
“When there's a drunk driving accident, you don't ban cars, you try to prevent drunk people from driving them,” Carlson opined. “The idea that taking guns away from the law abiding will make us safer is insane and childish.”
Co-host Anna Kooiman argued that “the number of guns in American households has actually gone down” as the number of mass shootings increase so guns could not be at fault.
“The other side of the that argument, of course, is — and what people always throw out there — is look at Australia,” co-host Clayton Morris noted. “They have no gun violence, they don't have guns, citizens aren't allowed to have guns.”
“They also have no freedom!” Carlson interrupted. “You can go to prison for expressing unpopular views and people do. And in Western Europe by the way. And in Canada. No one ever says that.”

“Would [the Umpqua shooter] have been going there in the first place if it wasn't a gun free zone?” Kooiman declared. “That's why we're seeing these mass shootings happen. It's not in places where you know there's going to be guns.”
The SBS television network explains that Australia's hate speech laws rarely result in penalties and “no-one ever goes to jail.”

The first sign that your city might be uptight: It hosts a forum to discuss how to be less uptight. Loosen Up, Boston? happens on Thursday at 6 p.m. at the Boston Public Library, per a release from the city. At the forum, civic leaders and industry heavyweights will talk about how to make Boston a little more hospitable to things like nightlife.
From the release: “Risque movies are no longer banned in Boston but proposals for new buildings, liquor licenses, and late operating hours often meet with great skepticism in many neighborhoods. To outsiders, and many local business owners and developers, efforts to protect neighborhoods come across as NIMBYism, nannyism, and resistance to a more active nightlife. How can we work together to find the right balance between maintaining Boston's character and needs of local residents while enhancing urban vitality and giving new night life venues a chance to take root?”
The forum is part of Building a Better Commonwealth, an initiative from the Boston Globe designed to unite experts and innovators. Want bars to stay open later? Go to the library! [CBS Local]
We are in the land of bewhiskered firearms experts, secret agents, and eccentric Majors, where the quality of weapons are considered by their effectiveness to kill, without thought to the consequences of this function. It's a fictional land, but with much bearing in fact.
Geoffrey Boothroyd liked to read spy novels, and in 1956, he was much taken by the latest thriller from Ian Fleming. But there was something wrong with this novel that featured the dashing Secret Service agent, James Bond, “certain inaccuracies” that made Mr. Boothroyd contact the author, to tell him:
“‘I don't think Bond was going to last very long if he used a 25 Beretta pistol…
.
If we look at the series of James Bond novels, we can see that in the first, Casino Royale, Fleming armed his hero with a .25 calibre Beretta M418. This was a small pocket pistol that had limited stopping power. Bond kept this weapon in a chamois shoulder holster, which sounds overly fashionable (and done so as not ruin the line of his jacket), but it is not practical for a quick draw, as the soft leather catches onto the pistol. This is why holsters are usually made of solid, hard leather, for easy access.
Boothroyd wrote a politely critical letter to Fleming, in which he stated:
I have, by now, got rather fond of Mr. James Bond. I like most of the things about him, with the exception of his rather deplorable taste in firearms. In particular, I dislike a man who comes into contact with all sorts of formidable people using a .25 Beretta. This sort of gun is really a lady's gun, and not a really nice lady at that. If Mr. Bond has to use a light gun he would be better off with a .22 rim fire; the lead bullet would cause more shocking effect than the jacketed type of the .25. May I suggest that Mr. Bond be armed with a revolver?
Geoffrey Boothroyd and Ian Fleming try out a pistol for James Bond.
Ian Fleming was greatly impressed by Boothroyd's knowledge, and wrote back:
KEMSLEY HOUSE, LONDON, W.C.1. 31st May, 1956 Dear Mr Boothroyd, I really am most grateful for your splendid letter of May 23rd. You have entirely convinced me and I propose, perhaps not in the next volume of James Bond's memoirs but, in the subsequent one, to change his weapons in accordance with your instructions. Since I am not in the habit of stealing another man's expertise, I shall ask you in due course to accept remuneration for your most valuable technical aid. Incidentally, can you suggest where I can see a .38 Airweight in London. Who would have one? As a matter of interest, how do you come to know so much about these things? I was delighted with the photographs and greatly impressed by them. If ever there is talk of making films of some of James Bond's stories in due course, I shall suggest to the company concerned that they might like to consult you on some technical aspects. But they may not take my advice, so please do not set too much store by this suggestion. From the style of your writing it occurs to me that you may have written books or articles on these subjects. Is that so? Bond has always admitted to me that the .25 Beretta was not a stopping gun, and he places much more reliance on his accuracy with it than in any particular qualities of the gun itself. As you know, one gets used to a gun and it may take some time for him to settle down with the Smith and Wesson. But I think M. should advise him to make a change; as also in the case of the .357 Magnum. He also agrees to give a fair trial to the Bern Martin holster, but he is inclined to favour something a little more casual and less bulky. The well-worn chamois leather pouch under his left arm has become almost a part of his clothes and he will be loath to make a change though, here again, M. may intervene. At the present moment Bond is particularly anxious for expertise on the weapons likely to be carried by Russian agents and I wonder if you have any information on this. As Bond's biographer I am most anxious to see that he lives as long as possible and I shall be most grateful for any further technical advices you might like me to pass on to him. Again, with very sincere thanks for your extremely helpful and workmanlike letter. Yours sincerely (Signed) IAN FLEMING G. Boothroyd, Esq.,

Indeed, Fleming did take on Mr. Boothroyd's advice. In the fifth Bond novel, From Russia With Love, the Secret Service agent was greatly imperiled when the silencer on his Beretta snagged on his favorite chamois holster. This was the last novel in which Bond used a Beretta 418. In the subsequent novel, Dr. No, Bond was armed with a Walther PPK.
As a “thank you” to the Glasgow-based firearms expert, Fleming created the character Major Boothroyd, who first appeared in the sixth novel Dr. No as Bond's service armorer. This character became “Q” in the Bond films, who was first played by Peter Burton in Dr. No, then from the second film, From Russia With Love, onwards, he was played by Desmond Llewelyn, until the actor's death in 1999. John Cleese then took over the role right up to the arrival of Daniel Craig, where “Q” disappeared from the film series, until Ben Wishaw took up the role in Skyfall (2012).
Boothroyd also helped design the three-quarter trigger guard pistol used on the cover of Fleming's From Russia With Love. Due to his interest in handguns, Boothroyd gave advice to the police during the murder investigation of American-Scottish serial killer Peter Manuel.
Boothroyd died in October 2001.
During the filming of the third James Bond movie, Goldfinger, at Pinewood Studios, England, in 1963, Sean Connery took time-off to present a brief film on the history of Bond's weapon of choice.
Connery introduces Geoffrey Boothroyd, who explains the background to his interest in the character, the differences between the Beretta 418, Walther PPK and Boothroyd's preferred gun, the Magnum 44—Dirty Harry's favored tool of his trade.

Five out of six deputy clerks in Rowan County, Ky., have agreed to issue same-sex marriage licenses after a judge found a Kentucky clerk in contempt of court and ordered her to jail for refusing to grant the licenses.
Kim Davis, a clerk in Rowan County, Kentucky, was found in contempt of court Thursday morning by Judge David Bunning.
Bunning said Davis would be released only when she agreed to follow his order and issue marriage licenses.
Davis has thus far refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, saying the act would “violate God's definition of marriage” and infringe on her beliefs as an Apostolic Christian.
The judge told all six of Davis' deputy clerks that they must issue marriage licenses to gay couples — or else they will face fines or jail time, too.
On Thursday afternoon, five of Davis' six deputy clerks testified that they would comply with the judge's orders to issue the marriage licenses.
Plaintiffs raised the question of whether that license would be legal, without the county's clerk's signature. The judge would not rule on that one way or the other.
The lone holdout among the deputy's clerk is the clerk's son, Nathan, according to The Associated Press.
Attorneys for jailed Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis have proposed allowing her out of custody if she agrees to not interfere with marriage licenses for gay couples.
The judge agreed to the proposal and is bringing Davis back into the courtroom to see if she will agree.
Three separate attacks carried out in the United States on a single day -- a New York bombing, a Minnesota mass stabbing and a New Jersey pipe bomb blast -- were under investigation Sunday for potential terror links.
Authorities say there is no evidence that any of the attacks were coordinated but the timing in less than 24 hours raises fears about security -- already a hot button issue in the country's deeply divisive presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
Twenty-nine people were injured when a bomb exploded in New York's upmarket Chelsea neighborhood on Saturday night, damaging neighboring buildings, shattering glass and sending shrapnel flying across the street.
A second bomb was uncovered by police four blocks away and defused safely, before undergoing analysis.
Hours earlier, less than 100 miles (160 kilometers) south in New Jersey, a pipe bomb exploded in a trash can on the sidelines of a Marine Corps run, causing no injuries but forcing the cancellation of the race.
More than 1,200 miles away to the West, an assailant reported to be Somali-American went on a stabbing spree in a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota, injuring nine people before being shot dead by an off-duty police officer.
US authorities said the motive of all three attacks was unclear, but elected officials quickly identified them as terror-related.
"If you look at a number of these incidents, you can call them whatever you want -- they are terrorism, though," New Jersey's Republican Governor Chris Christie, a key member of the Trump campaign, told CNN.
"A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism, but it's not linked to international terrorism," State Governor Andrew Cuomo told reporters on Sunday after touring the scene of the explosion.
"In other words, we find no ISIS connection, et cetera," said Cuomo in reference to the Islamic State group. But he also stressed the lack of international terror link was preliminary.
There has been no claim for the bombings in Manhattan or New Jersey, but a jihadist-linked news agency claimed that an IS "soldier" carried out the Minnesota stabbing.
IS has repeatedly called for attacks on countries in the US-led coalition bombing the extremist group in Syria and Iraq.
"This should steel our resolve to protect our country and defeat ISIS and other terrorist groups," said Clinton, whose lead in the polls has recently taken a dip, condemning what she called "apparent terrorist attacks."
Trump, who called the explosion in New York a bombing more than 12 hours before officials or police did so in public, tweeted his "best wishes and condolences to all of the families and victims of the horrible bombing."
In Minnesota, FBI agent Rick Thornton confirmed that federal agents were investigating the stabbing as "a potential act of terrorism," as local media identified the suspect as a 22-year-old Somali-American.
Police confirmed that the assailant asked some victims whether they were Muslim before attacking them and made "references to Allah."
While all 29 people who were injured in the New York bombing have been released from medical care, three of those hurt in Minnesota remain in hospital, officials said.
US media reported that the New York bomb was planted in a dumpster, but police say they are still not "100 percent" certain where the blast originated with major construction work taking place close by.
"We know it's a very serious incident, but we have a lot more work to do to be able to say what kind of motivation was behind this," Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters.
"Was it a political motivation, a personal motivation. What was it? We do not know," he added, calling on residents to be vigilant.
Fifteen years after the September 11, 2001 attacks, officials stress that the United States is safer from terror plots that originate from overseas but more at risk from the lone-wolf attack perpetrated by individuals who may be inspired by IS or Al-Qaeda propaganda.
New York went on alert, deploying nearly 1,000 extra state police and National Guardsmen to airports, bus terminals and subway stations as the city prepared to host world leaders at the UN General Assembly from Monday.
New York lauds itself as the safest big city in America. Violent crime is rare in Manhattan and police say they have foiled 20 terror plots since the 2001 Al-Qaeda plane hijackings destroyed the Twin Towers.
"In many of these cases we don't know until two, three or four days later whether or not there is a terrorist link," New York Congressman Peter King told CBS.
"The fact there is no evidence right now doesn't mean much," he added.
A bizarre conspiracy theory claims a bombshell document leak that reveals a sinister plan by the Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign to stage a false flag alien UFO invasion of Earth on November 8, Election Day.
According to the weird conspiracy theory, the move to fake a massive alien UFO invasion of Earth on Election Day is part of an overall strategy by Democrats to allow President Barack Obama to suspend the general election, declare martial law, and then hand over power to “Crooked Hillary Clinton.”
The alleged sinister and evil plan called Project Firesign is a limited version of Project Blue Beam being implemented for the limited purpose of subverting the popular will of voters on November 8, according to conspiracy theorists.
Details of the bizarre plan were revealed through two email leaks, namely, WikiLeaks Podesta emails and a PDF document attributed to Benenson Strategy Group (BSG), allegedly leaked by the hacktivist group Anonymous.
The PDF document claims to reveal details of a study conducted on behalf of the Clinton Foundation by BSG to develop a strategy to subvert the election process through staging an alien invasion false flag on November 8.
Although even a cursory assessment of the PDF document suggests it is a forgery due to its glaringly unprofessional presentation and format, many Americans who take their news from the so-called “alternative news sources” are taking claims that the document is a genuine leak by Anonymous seriously.
The document begins with a report on the results of an alleged telephone survey conducted using a representative sample of “2,021 adult Americans” on October 10-13, 2016. The “unskewed poll” found that despite doctored polling results that give the impression that Clinton is set for a resounding victory over the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, her favorability ratings have crashed to historic lows (12 percent) while Trump has consolidated support among independents.
The document claims that support has shifted from Clinton to Trump and Jill Stein among independents and liberal whites. It claims that the strategy to discredit Trump through accusations of sexual misconduct is failing because the allegations have largely been debunked and because the majority of women “understand that confident men talk that way” — a reference to Trump's “locker room talk.”

The PDF document then gives details of a second survey that attempts to determine what could stop likely voters from voting on Election Day, as part of efforts to develop a strategy to help Hillary Clinton win the election.
Some of the events that could stop people from voting, according to the document, include a powerful storm, a Zika virus scare, threat of violence at polling places, long lines at polling places, threat of natural disaster, Black Lives Matter riots, civil unrest, and attack by extraterrestrials.
The document gives the impression that the Clinton campaign has been conducting studies to determine the most effective way to stop Trump voters from going out to vote on Election Day. But it concludes, based on survey results, that “Trump voters are unstoppable.” This means that false flag operations, such as Zika threats, threat of violence, and Black Lives Matter violence are designed to discourage Trump voters from going out to vote on Election Day would fail.
The document also points out that the elaborate strategy to rig the election in Clinton's favor through a “poll-driven narrative” has failed because the use of doctored polls as a psychological weapon to manipulate voters has been “pushed too far.”
People, according to the document, have become aware that polls are being doctored to give the impression that Clinton has a comfortable lead over Trump.
After painting a gloomy and dire situation that suggests that all strategies to rig the election in favor of Clinton have failed, the document goes on to recommend a “final salvage option” that might still help Clinton to achieve her ambition to become president of the United States.
Project Firesign
The document recommends the adoption of Project Firesign as the only viable “salvage option” for the Clinton campaign. Project Firesign involves the staging of a false flag alien UFO invasion event.
But before recommending Project Firesign as the only viable “salvage option,” the study reviewed and rejected other potential “salvage options”:
Red Dawn: UN forces scuttle the election Cobalt rain: A radiological attack A Black Lives Matter riot A false flag Zika epidemic using an improved strain of the virus “Sharia escalation” False flag “unnatural disaster” events, such as exploding a thermobaric weapon in fracking mine
After considering the pros and cons of the various potential options, the study recommended Project Firesign as the best “salvage option” to stop an inevitable Trump victory at the 2016 general election.
What is Project Firesign?
According to the document, Project Firesign is a Department of Defense and NASA black project that has been under development for two decades. The purpose of Firesign is to induce mass religious hysteria by using state-of-the-art holographic laser projection technology to throw hyper-realistic 3D images on the “sodium layer” of the atmosphere at an altitude of about 100 km.
“The aftermath of FIRESIGN will be the psychological subjugation of areas where uprisings are most likely to occur.”
Project Firesign will use sophisticated 3D holographic laser projectors to throw movie images in the sky. The images will cover thousands of square miles of Republican voting regions, equivalent to 23 percent of the total land mass of the United States. The 3D movie images will simulate an alien UFO invasion on a gigantic scale.
The images will simulate massive floating cities, gigantic futuristic alien spacecraft with advanced laser weaponry, all mixed judiciously with throwback elements incorporating biblical art motifs of Jesus's Second Coming, angelic beings armed with flaming swords, chariots of fire, cherubim, and seraphim…
The 3D movie images will look convincingly real and will be augmented with “pulsed ELF electromagnetic emissions” that stimulate specific areas of the prefrontal cortex linked to religious and spiritual experiences.
Augmentation of the realistic 3D images with “pulsed ELF electromagnetic emissions” will trigger mass religious-spiritual hysteria (“Damascus-Road-Experience”) characterized by gross transformation and destabilization of mental equilibrium on a large scale.
According to the document, the envisaged scenario and its psychological mass hysteria impact are feasible because successful field tests have been conducted in the “Levant.”
“Firesign will require a great deal of power, mobile command stations with nitrogen-cooled super-computers, and the co-opting of the ELF arrays.”

“The trauma of Firesign will provide cover to govt and NGOs who will be ‘providing aid' (psychotropic drugs to induce docility)… [and] ensure further domestication [of the masses].”
The implementation of Firesign on Election Day will bring the electoral process to a halt. President Obama will then declare a state of national emergency, impose martial law and assume absolute powers as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, ostensibly to fight and overcome the alien invasion.
According to the document, after achieving a fake victory, Obama would then hand over power to “Crooked Hillary Clinton.” Clinton would then assume power under martial law as President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces to ensure “continuity of the state.”
The “Obama-Clinton ruling cabal” will justify perpetuation of martial law as essential in the post-invasion period to allow government to rehabilitate traumatized citizens.

Undertaking what will be one of the most unusual pre-season team-building camps in cycling history, the Tinkoff Saxo management have today confirmed that the riders and staff will together climb the 5,895 metre Kilimanjaro mountain early next month.
In total 80 people will be part of the expedition, which will see them scale what is Africa's highest mountain and also the highest free-standing peak in the world.
For many years team manager Bjarne Riis' squads conducted tough pre-season camps, but money shortages curtailed these in more recent times. However the team has much more resources since Oleg Tinkov took over ownership, and Riis said that he expected the trip to have clear benefits.
“For quite some time now, a number of Tinkoff-Saxo Team members have been asking me to organize a team-building trip,” he said. “I talked to the management, I got the green light from Oleg Tinkov, and I started planning it. This will be a very good challenge for everybody and I look forward to seeing how the team reacts under this kind of stress and difficult conditions, climbing in such high altitudes.”
The six day exercise will begin with the Tinkoff Saxo riders and staff travelling to the city of Moshi in Tanzania. On November 1 the expedition will start at the Machama Gate (1,828m) of the Mount Kilimanjaro National Park.
The next four days will see the participants complete six to eight hours of trekking each day, after which they will arrive at the 4,040 metre-high Karanga Camp. They will rest there, then at around midnight on November 4 the group will begin the long climb to the top of the mountain.
It is anticipated that the team should reach the summit the following morning.
“I want to see a group where everybody works together, building the foundations for the next season,” said Riis. “It is no secret we aim at becoming the best cycling team in the world but how do you define that? Is it the team with the most points, the team with the most race victories or is there more to it?
“For me, it is the team that has a bit of everything; points, victories but also members that are proud to be a part of it. We want a team that has values and works with values and a trip such as this one will help us create a very strong and united group.”
The team will once again be led by Alberto Contador, who recovered from a fractured tibia and an injured knee to win the Vuelta a España. As riders are unaccustomed to extended hiking, the camp and the climb to the summit of Kilimanjaro will be an additional test for Contador's leg.
News just broke that the Sun-Times is laying off its entire photography staff, some 20 full-time employees. Tina Sfondeles is listing the names of her laid-off colleagues. Three of the first four have been at the Sun-Times since before I was born; combined, those four have around 140 years of experience. This one hits hard:
Pulitzer Prize winning photographer John H. White had been at the Sun-Times since 1978. — Tina Sfondeles (@TinaSfon) May 30, 2013
White was one of the first black photographers for an American daily newspaper. The first, John Tweedle, was hired in 1964 (!) by the Chicago Daily News; White was hired in 1969. He's been a photojournalist ever since. When I was a high school student, White addressed my summer journalism program at Northwestern. Of all the excellent journalists who talked with us—White was not the only Pulitzer winner—it was White, a deeply religious and philosophical man, who made the deepest impression with a moral committment to his profession that went down to his bones.
The Tribune's Scott Strazzante got to spend time photographing White himself, a peer and competitor, on assignment, and came away with the same impression: “John likes to say that he sometimes is given ‘assignments from God.' Well, I can honestly say that my time spent with John H. White was a gift.”
There's plenty of White's work at the Sun-Times site. Despite his legendary reputation, White's still very much a working daily news photographer. Recently, for example, been given the pedestrian job of photographing the Wells Street Bridge reconstruction. He's an artist, but he's also a beat photographer. But some of White's best work, and one of my favorite Chicago photo collections of all time, came not for the Sun-Times but for the federal government as part of the EPA's Documerica project, sort of 1970s reboot of the profoundly important FSA/OWI photography of the 1930s and 1940s. I posted on this a while back, but am pleased to be able to present them in the vivid size they deserve.
The National Basketball Association's Toronto Raptors have announced that January 11 will be deemed “Drake Night.”
In honor of “Drake Night,” the Toronto basketball squad has partnered with OVO Sound to release a limited edition “Drake Night” T-shirt, slated to be given to the evening's attendees for the home team's game against the visiting Brooklyn Nets, a basketball organization that was previously partially owned by Jay-Z.
Beyond “Drake Night,” Sports Illustrated reports that the Toronto Raptors are weighing the possibility of a re-branding effort that would change the team's colors to OVO's black and gold scheme.
In September, Drake and the Toronto Raptors announced a partnership. Drake was named the team's global ambassador, an honor that the YMCMB emcee spoke about at the announcement press conference.
“There's something genuine about this city,” Drake said at the time. “There's something great. I think aside from that with All-Star coming here there's an untapped nightlife, restaurants, culture. There's so much to soak in and I think that our goal is in 2016 to truly showcase that, not only for the players, but also for everybody.”
Toronto is slated to host NBA's All-Star Weekend in 2016.

The head of the UK's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) has formally apologized for a ban on homosexuals which led to the dismissal and subsequent suicide of one of its best-ever code breakers, Alan Turing, in the 1950s.
Speaking on Tuesday, Robert Hannigan told a gay rights workplace conference in London that Turing had been an example to others as he had not been afraid to think "differently and radically."
Alan Turing portrait at the National Gallery
"[I want to] say how sorry I am that he and so many others were treated in this way," Hannigan said. "Their suffering was our loss." GCHQ's ban on homosexuals was only lifted in the 1990s. The life of Turing was featured in a recent film with Benedict Cumberbatch "The Imitation Game.'
"To do our job, which is solving some of the hardest technology problems the world faces for security reasons, we need all talents and we need people who dare to think differently and be different," Hannigan said.
While Turing, and other gay men were regarded as security risks by their employers, the UK's domestic spy agency MI5 was recently rated the country's most gay-friendly employer by campaign group Stonewall. Six years ago it was ranked 134 on the index.

Now with an outward presence on Twitter
GCHQ rarely makes public pronouncements and so its entry to the world of social media made Monday a double-first. "We want GCHQ to be more accessible and to help the public understand more about our work," an unnamed spokesperson said. "We also want to reach out to the technical community and add our voice to social media conversations about technology," maths and cyber-security.
The agency's first tweet "Hello, world" came with a background image of its ring-shaped building in Cheltenham, known locally as the "doughnut."
GCHQ presented itself as an agency "Where our brightest people bring together intelligence and technology to keep Britain safe."
The US Central Intelligence Agency, which joined Twitter in February 2014 and boasts 1.36 million followers, was concise in its welcome:
Within four hours, GCHQ was testing the mental agility of its 16,300 new Twitter followers with a soccer-doku puzzle based on England and Wales' group in the upcoming Euro 2016 tournament in France:
Others reflected on whom the spy agency would follow from its official account, starting with a famous and fictitious operative:
jm/msh (Reuters, AFP)
A new Washington Post/ABC News poll shows that disapproval of the GOP's handling of the budget has jumped to 70 percent. Meanwhile, approval of Obama's handling of it has ticked modestly upwards.
Only 24 percent of Americans approve of the GOP's handling of the budget, after a week of battling over the shutdown. Only 23 percent of independents approve, versus 73 percent who disapprove. Among moderates, those numbers are 22-73. That's nearly three fourths of independents and moderates disapproving. (While independents disapprove of Obama's handling of it, the numbers are far less lopsided; moderates overall approve of his handling.)
But what's even more striking is the degree to which even Republicans are divided over the GOP's handling of all of this, with approval being largely concentrated among conservative Republicans.
This way of cutting the data is made possible because the Post polling team asked the question twice over the last couple of weeks and was able to combine the data, resulting in a larger sample that allowed for more fine-grained cutting of it. Here's the key conclusion:
The wide unpopularity of Republicans in Congress in budget talks is in large part due to a schism within Republicans themselves. By 59 to 39 percent, conservative Republicans approve of the way their party's members of congress have handled budget negotiations in combined interviews over two weeks. But Republicans who identify as moderate or liberal split narrowly: 44 percent approval to 49 percent disapproval. This ideological split within the Republican party comes into sharper focus when looking at the most conservative party members. Republicans who describe themselves as “very conservative” approve of Republicans in Congress by 68 to 32 percent. Those who are just “somewhat conservative” split 51 to 45 percent in two weeks of combined poll results.
On balance, only “conservative” and “very conservative” Republicans largely approve of the GOP performance. Moderate Republicans tilt against it and “somewhat conservative” Republicans are split.
Meanwhile, a new CNN poll finds 63 percent are angry at Republicans for the shutdown, versus 53 percent who are angry at Obama. There's little question that Obama, too, will take a hit amid these crises. But he isn't running for reelection, and Republicans look very likely to take a substantially bigger hit.
As I've noted here before, it's very possible broader public perceptions of Obama and Republicans — on topics such as which side is really on the side of the middle class and which side is genuinely committed to constructive governing — will shape public views of the shutdown. Given that polling at the very start of the shutdown suggested the middle of the country views Republicans harshly on both of those scores — and is now overwhelmingly disapproving of the GOP's handling of the shutdown — there's some evidence to suggest this may be what's beginning to happen.
Letter From A Vegan World
(also in Dutch, French, German, Greek, Italian, Norwegian, Romanian, Spanish, Turkish)
Download the PDF Dear friends and fellow activists, At a time when most animal rights organizations are actively promoting, advocating and rewarding "humane" animal products and farming methods, I am writing to you on behalf of three of the recipients of that mercy. To the industry, they are known as production units #6, #35, and #67,595. To the "compassionate" consumer, they are known as feel-good labels: "organic dairy", "rose veal", "free-range eggs". To welfare advocates, they are known as "humane alternatives". To each other, they are known as mother, son, sister, friend. To themselves, they are simply what you and I are to ourselves: a self-aware, self-contained world of subjective experiences, feelings, fears, memories – someone with the absolute certainty that his or her life is worth living. #6, is a first time mother. She is frantic. Her baby is missing. She is pacing desperately up and down the paddock, bellowing and crying, and calling for her lost boy, fearing the worst, having her fears confirmed. She is one of the thousands of defenseless females born into a quaint, verdant, organic dairy farm. She will spend her entire short life grieving the loss of baby after baby. She will be milked relentlessly through repeated cycles of pregnancies and bereavements. Her only experience of motherhood will be that of a mother's worst loss. In the prime of her life, her body will give, her spirit will break, her milk "production" will decline, and she will be sent to a horrifying slaughter, along with other grieving, defeated, "spent" mothers like herself.
She is the face of organic milk. #35 is a two-days old baby, his umbilical chord is still attached, his coat is still slick with birth fluids, his eyes are unfocused, his legs, wobbly. He is crying pitifully for his mother. No one answers. He will live his entire short life an orphan, his only experience of mother love will be one of yearning for it, his only experience of emotional connection, one of absence. Soon, the memory of his mother, her face, her voice, her scent, will fade, but the painful, irrepressible longing for her warmth will still be there. At four months old, he and other orphans like himself will be corralled into trucks and hauled to slaughter. As he will be dragged onto the killing floor, he will still be looking for his mother, still desperately needing her nurturing presence, especially at that dark time when he will be frightened and needing her more than ever in the midst of the terrible sights, and sounds, and scents of death all around him and, in his despair, in his want for a shred of consolation and protection, he, like most baby calves, will try to suckle the fingers of his killers.
He is the face of the "rose" veal we are encouraging "responsible restaurant leaders" to use. #67,595 is one of the 80,000 birds in a family-owned "free-range" egg facility. She has never seen the sun, or felt the grass under her feet, she has never met her mother. Her eyes are burning with the sting of ammonia fumes, her featherless body is covered with bruises and abrasions, her bones are brittle from the constant drain of egg production, her severed beak is throbbing in pain. She is exhausted, depleted and defeated. After a lifetime of social, psychological, emotional, physical deprivation, she copes by pecking neurotically at phantom targets for hours on end. She is two years old and her life is over. Her egg production has declined, and she will be disposed of by the cheapest means possible – she will be gassed along with the other 80,000 birds in her community. It will take three full work days to finish the job. For two long days, she will hear the sounds and breathe the smells of her sisters being killed in the gas drums outside her shed. On the third day, it will be her turn. She will be grabbed by the legs and taken outdoors for the first time in her life and, like every single one of the 80,000 "spent" hens, like every single one of the 50 billion annual victims of our appetite, she will fight to go on living, and she will accept no explanation and no justification for being robbed of her pathetic only life.
She is the face of the "free-range" eggs we are encouraging college campuses, businesses and consumers to use. These are the "beneficiaries" of the "humane farming practices" that we, the animals' defenders, are developing, promoting, and publicly rewarding by encouraging "compassionate" consumers to buy the products of what we know to be nothing but misery. "Humane" practices that, if any of us were forced to endure, none of us would experience as humane. We, the activists, know that there is no such thing as compassionate, responsible or ethical farming on any scale. We know that the only humane and ethical alternative is vegan living. Why are so few of us telling the truth? Why are we describing "free-range" products as "humane" when we know the horror such practices inflict on their victims? Why are we lying to the public, and ourselves, that "compassionate" animal farming is anything but a myth, a marketing scheme, a deceptive label? Why are so many of us offering up the lives of animals by encouraging the consumption of their flesh, eggs and milk, when our only duty is to fight for their lives as if they were our own? Why are we promoting the practice of consuming animals when we know it to be brutal, inexcusable, unconscionable and completely unnecessary? Why are we rewarding consumers for demanding more of the the very thing we are struggling to eliminate? Why are we strengthening and rewarding the worlds' entrenched speciesist assumptions, when our job, our only job, as vegan educators and activists, is to challenge and change those assumptions by offering a new model of thinking about nonhuman animals, a new model of interacting with them, a new practice of living, a new way of being in the world? Many of us justify our endorsement of "humane" animal products and our pursuit of welfare reforms by saying that the world is not ready to change, that it may never go vegan, that the most we can hope to accomplish in the meantime is to reduce the suffering of today's doomed animals. But this is not true. This is not a fact. It is a fear – a fear of action, a failure of will, a self- defeating attitude and, ultimately, a self-fulfilling prophecy. The truth is, the world can change. Indeed, the world has changed many times before, and it has changed in ways that seemed impossible at the time. The truth is, the world will change, but only if we work towards creating that change. It will stay the same if we, the self-proclaimed agents of change, encourage it to stay the same. It will change if all of us tell the whole truth that there is no such thing as humane animal farming, or animal use of any kind, the truth that the only humane alternative is vegan living, the truth that animal farming on any scale is an ethical and environmental disaster, the truth that animals are persons like you and me who happen to be nonhuman and who have the same inherent right to life and liberty as you and me. The truth that vegan living is not a "lifestyle choice", but a moral imperative. We can do better. Indeed, we have an obligation to do better. I invite you to see for yourselves how much can be accomplished when a small group of dedicated activists commits all of its time and resources to vegan education that is consistent with, not undermining of, our ultimate goal – Animal Liberation – and when the Go Vegan message is central to every single one of its communications, from online resources, to printed literature, to ads, demos, and billboards, to outreach events, to the in-depth exploration of farmed animal personhood detailed in the individual portraits published on the Prairie Blog. On a shoestring budget, with an all-volunteer core of vegan educators who are determined to tell the whole truth about meat, dairy and egg production, a small, grassroots organization like Peaceful Prairie Sanctuary has built something that large, wealthy organizations have not only failed to bring forth, but have consistently undermined through years of anti-vegan advocacy: A vibrant vegan world growing in the middle of the nonvegan world, a place where the animal refugees are regarded and represented as the persons they rightly are, a place where the human residents advocate tirelessly for nothing less than total liberation, a Free State in the heart of the human-subjugated world, a place where the principles of abolition are applied in word, thought, and deed. A vegan enclave whose very presence has already changed the world's physical, political, psychological and spiritual geography. I invite you to experience it for yourselves. Join us in our struggle to expand its reach. Help us make it borderless. Joanna Lucas,

What's in a name? Potentially your future.
A host of research shows just how much your name can affect your lifetime success, from your hireability to your spending habits.
We took a look at the research and have highlighted some of the surprising findings below.
Maggie Zhang contributed to an earlier version of this article.
If your name is easy to pronounce, people will favor you more.
In a New York University study, researchers found that people with easier-to-pronounce names often have higher-status positions at work. One of the psychologists, Adam Alter, explains to Wired, "When we can process a piece of information more easily, when it's easier to comprehend, we come to like it more." In a further study, Alter also found that companies with simpler names and ticker symbols tended to perform better in the stock market.
In a Marquette University study, the researchers found evidence to suggest that names that were viewed as the least unique were more likable. People with common names were more likely to be hired, and those with rare names were least likely to be hired. That means that the Jameses, Marys, Johns, and Patricias of the world are in luck.
A 2009 study at Shippensburg University suggested that there's a strong relationship between the popularity of one's first name and juvenile criminal behavior. Researchers found that, regardless of race, young people with unpopular names were more likely to engage in criminal activity. The findings obviously don't show that the unusual names caused the behavior, but merely show a link between the two things. And the researchers have some theories about their findings. "Adolescents with unpopular names may be more prone to crime because they are treated differently by their peers, making it more difficult for them to form relationships," they write in a statement from the journal's publisher. "Juveniles with unpopular names may also act out because they ... dislike their names."
In one study cited by The Atlantic, white-sounding names like Emily Walsh and Greg Baker got nearly 50% more callbacks than candidates with black-sounding names like Lakisha Washington and Jamal Jones. Researchers determined that having a white-sounding name is worth as much as eight years of work experience.
For a study published in the Economics of Education Review, researchers studied the relationship between the position in the alphabet of more than 90,000 Czech students' last names and their admission chances at competitive schools. They found that even though students with last names that were low in the alphabet tended to get higher test scores overall, among the students who applied to universities and were on the margins of getting admitted or not, those with last names that were close to the top of the alphabet were more likely to be admitted.
According to one study, people with last names such as Yardley or Zabar may be more susceptible to promotional strategies like limited-time offers. The authors speculate that spending your childhood at the end of the roll call may make you want to jump on offers before you miss the chance.
According to research published in the European Journal of Social Psychology, using a middle initial increases people's perceptions of your intellectual capacity and performance. In one study, students were asked to rate an essay with one of four styles of author names. Not only did the authors with a middle initial receive top marks, but the one with the most initials, David F.P.R. Clark, received the best reviews.
Since we identify with our names, we prefer things that are similar to them. In a Ghent University study, researchers found that people are more likely to work for companies matching their own initials. For example, Brian Ingborg might work for Business Insider. The rarer the initials, the more likely people were to work for companies with names similar to their own.
In a European study, researchers studied German names and ranks within companies. Those with last names such as Kaiser ("emperor") or König ("king") were in more managerial positions than those with last names that referred to common occupations, such as Koch ("cook") or Bauer ("farmer"). This could be the result of associative reasoning, a psychological theory describing a type of thinking in which people automatically link emotions and previous knowledge with similar words or phrases.
For his 2005 study, University of Florida economics professor David Figlio studied a large Florida school district from 1996 to 2000 and found that boys with names most commonly given to girls misbehaved more in middle school and were more likely to disrupt their peers. He also found that their behavioral problems were linked with increased disciplinary problems and lower test scores.
If you are a woman with a gender-neutral name, you may be more likely to succeed in certain fields.
According to The Atlantic, in male-dominated fields such as engineering and law, women with gender-neutral names may be more successful. One study found that women with "masculine names" like Leslie, Jan, or Cameron tended to be more successful in legal careers.

In 2011, LinkedIn analyzed more than 100 million user profiles to find out which names are most associated with the CEO position. The most common names for men were short, often one-syllable names like Bob, Jack, and Bruce. A name specialist speculates that men in power may use nicknames to offer a sense of friendliness and openness.
In the same study, LinkedIn researchers found that the most common names of female CEOs include Deborah, Cynthia, and Carolyn. Unlike the men, women may use their full names in an attempt to project professionalism and gravitas, according to the report.

Last Monday, as tensions escalated throughout the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, Abdel-Rahman Shadi Khalil Obeidallah, 13, from Aida refugee camp in Bethlehem became one of the latest Palestinian children shot and killed by Israeli forces in circumstances that suggest a deliberate unlawful killing. While grave violations against Palestinian children by Israeli forces are a cornerstone of Israel's seemingly permanent military occupation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, recent policy changes combined with systemic impunity will inevitably amplify an already dire situation for Palestinian children.
Recently the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, promised a “harsh offensive” in response to the latest protests against Israel's occupation and violence. During the first week of October, suspected Palestinian gunmen killed two Israeli settlers near the West Bank village of Beit Furik. On Oct. 3, Israeli police gunned down Muhannad Halabi, a 19-year-old Palestinian law student, after he stabbed to death an off-duty Israeli soldier and a rabbi in Jerusalem's Old City, according to news reports. Hours later, police shot dead Fadi Alloun, 18, near the Old City's Damascus Gate in East Jerusalem for allegedly stabbing a 15-year-old Israeli boy. Video of the shooting depicts Israeli police officers opening fire on Alloun as a crowd of onlookers urges them on. On the evening of Oct. 4, Israeli forces killed Huthayfa Othman Suleiman, 18, during clashes near the West Bank city of Tulkarem, Palestinian media reported. And the list goes on.

Netanyahu's pledge comes after Israeli authorities relaxed live-fire rules providing Israeli police a green light to use live ammunition against Palestinian stone throwers in Jerusalem whenever they decide a “threat to life” exists. This is a significant change as live ammunition was previously only justified when an individual posed a direct, mortal threat to an officer's own life.
While international law requires that intentional lethal force be used only when absolutely unavoidable, investigations by Defense for Children International Palestine (DCIP) regularly find that children posed no direct, mortal threat to the life of any police officer or soldier at the time they were killed.
For example, on May 15, 2014, two Palestinian teenagers, Nadeem Siam Nawara, 17, and Mohammad Mahmoud Odeh Salameh Abu Daher, 16, were shot and killed by Israeli forces near Israel's Ofer military prison in the West Bank. Nadeem sustained a fatal gunshot wound to the chest, and Mohammad was shot in the back about an hour later in nearly the same spot. CCTV cameras, fixed on the building where the boys were shot, captured the fatal shootings, and reaffirmed that neither boy posed any lethal or imminent threat to Israeli forces at the time they were killed.
Recent changes to live-fire rules must be seen against the broader context of prolonged Israeli military occupation of Palestinians living in the West Bank and Jerusalem, where Palestinian children have endured heightened levels of violence in recent years as Israeli soldiers and police increasingly use excessive force to quash protests. Since 2014, at least 16 Palestinian children have died there at the hands of Israeli forces, all except one with live ammunition, according to evidence collected by DCIP. Only one incident resulted in both an investigation and indictment.
In a context where violent crimes against Palestinians by Israeli forces go unpunished and are often completely ignored by Israeli authorities, the relaxation of live-fire rules provide the Israeli military and police with tacit approval to inflict maximum harm.
At least 48 Palestinian children were injured in the first week of October, based on DCIP's initial data. On Sunday, Israeli forces killed 14-year-old Ahmad Sharaka with live ammunition during demonstrations near the Jewish-only settlement of Beit El outside Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. He was the twenty-fourth Palestinian to be killed in October.

Even before the live-fire standard was lowered, the misuse of sponge-tipped plastic bullets by Israeli border police during clashes with Palestinian youth in East Jerusalem resulted in serious injuries to three children in September, according to documentation by DCIP. None of the children injured participated in the confrontations. These injuries followed the death of Mohammad Sunukrut, 16, in September 2014.
This past September marked fifteen years since the outbreak of the second intifada. During that time, Israeli forces and settlers have killed at least 1,997 Palestinian children, while survivors have had their futures stifled and suppressed by systemic discrimination, constant settlement expansion, and prolonged military occupation.
Children now represent 46.2 percent of the 4.68 million Palestinians living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and Israeli leadership seems more intent than ever to rely on the use of excessive force to manage an unjust, oppressive, and entirely unsustainable military occupation. The need for justice and accountability is urgent, yet unlikely to occur any time soon. Israeli officials must prohibit the use of excessive force against unarmed Palestinians, and ensure that Israeli forces at all times act in accordance with international law.

Intentional explanation is a strikingly useful form of explanation, and human life would be unrecognisable if we did not routinely apply it to the understanding of individual behaviour. So it is not surprising that we routinely also use the idiom of intentional explanation – of beliefs, desires, and actions aimed at satisfying those desires according to those beliefs – to talk about human collectives. After all, if we could explain collective behaviour by reference to collective beliefs and desires, that would be a major explanatory boon. On the other hand, if we applied this explanatory scheme to phenomena which do not fit it, we would simply be entangling ourselves in unproductive metaphors. The philosophical project of analysing collective intentionality is important because it helps us to see when intentional explanations of collective phenomena are well-founded, and when they are not.
There are two well-discussed sorts of case where intentional explanations of collective phenomena are appropriate; this paper aims to make space for a third in between them. Continue reading Joint Mental States and Quasi-Agential Groups
One week ago, we were stunned to learn just how low the political organization that is the mostly US-taxpayer funded IMF has stooped when, a day after its negotiators demonstratively stormed out of the Greek negotiations with "creditors", Hermes' ambassador-at-large Christone Lagarde said that the IMF "could lend to Ukraine even if Ukraine determines it cannot service its debt."
In other words, as Greece struggles to avoid a default to the IMF on debt which was incurred just so German banks can remain solvent and dump trillions in non-performing loans to US hedge funds and Greek exposure, and which would result in the collapse in the living standards of an entire nation (only for a few years before an Iceland-recovery takes place, one which Greece would already be enjoying had it defaulted in 2010 as we said it should), and as the "criminal" IMF does everything in its power to subjugate an entire nation, or else let it founder, the IMF told Soros' BFFs over in Kiev, that no matter if they default to its private creditors (in fact please do since Russia is among them), the IMF would keep the debt spigot flowing.
Courtesy of the US taxpayer of course.
Fast forward one week when, with Greece one step closer to a full-blown financial collapse, the IMF comes out and tell Ukraine - which already passed a law allowing it to impose a debt moratorium at any moment - not to worry, that even in a default it will keep providing unlimited funds. From Reuters:
Ukraine's efforts to strike a debt restructuring deal with its creditors will allow the International Monetary Fund to continue to support the country even if the talks are not successful, the head of the IMF said on Friday. "I ... welcome the government's continued efforts to reach a collaborative agreement with all creditors," IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said in a statement. "This is important since this means that the Fund will be able to continue to support Ukraine through its Lending-into-Arrears Policy even in the event that a negotiated agreement with creditors in line with the program cannot be reached in a timely manner."
We will pass comment on this latest grand IMF hypocrisy and ask if Greece would rather be in Kiev's place which at the behest of "Western" leaders, it sold, liquidated, and otherwise "lost" all of its gold. Or, like Ukraine, Athens is willing to part with its $4 billion in gold just to appease the Troika as it sells all of its 112.5 tons of official gold to unknown buyers. A transaction which would buy Greece about 3-6 months of can kick and a few stray smiles from Chrstine Lagarde.
France will ask its European Union partners to do more to help its intervention in the strife-torn Central African Republic, Foreign Affairs Minister Laurent Fabius said on Sunday ahead of a meeting in Brussels on Monday.
"Tomorrow I will go to the Foreign Affairs Council and I will ask that there be more solid, stronger support," Fabius said Sunday on Europe 1 radio.
Dossier: War in Mali
Poland, Britain, Germany, Spain and Belgium are already helping with logistics, he said, and two countries are "currently considering" sending troops to back up the 1,600 soldiers there.
Nearly half of the 4.5-million population is in "pre-famine conditions", according to the minister, and there are only seven surgeons among that number.
Fabius rejected claims that the French army has precipitated the massacre of Muslims by disarming the former Seleka rebels, leaving them at the mercy of Christian militias intent on revenge.
"The Seleka... still have weapons and sometimes heavy weapons," he said. "So the first task is to disarm these heavy weapons. We also go to the Christians to say 'you must disarm'."
Right-wing former agriculture minister Bruno Le Maire expressed reservations about the intervention on Sunday.
He claimed that the political justification is "not clear" and that the cost will be high, while France is "alone", and called on President François Hollande to seek more money from the European Union and more troops from other countries through the United Nations.
Hollande has already pledged that he will ask for more European back-up at a summit on Thursday and Friday.

Sunday night, San Francisco's tech elite gathered downtown for the first night of the annual Crunchies, a conference and award show celebrating all things startup. A long line extended down the block leading to the Davies Symphony Hall, and private security guards checked tickets at the door. But a block away, a different kind of crowd was gathering. "Ellis Act out, rent control in," chanted Erin McElroy, leader of the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project. "Killing our elders is a damn sin." Protesters held signs that reworked the Crunchies into the "Crappies," a parody award show.
"We're protesting here because we don't think there's anything to be awarded," said Patricia Kerman, who was evicted by her landlord after living in San Francisco for more than 40 years. "They should be ashamed."
Rents have skyrocketed, evictions have risen
Over the last five years, rents in San Francisco have climbed an average of 12.3 percent a year, more than four times the national average. Many longtime residents have been displaced by rising costs, or simply evicted by landlords who can use California's Ellis Act to remove tenants if they plan to convert the building or put it up for sale. Much of the blame for this economic displacement has fallen on the tech industry, which has been booming thanks to a strong IPO market. Kerman, who is retired, has been living in the city since 1970 and got her Ellis eviction notice this August. "They're having an impact and doing nothing about it," she says of the tech companies. "It's an attitude of entitlement, of arrogance that's coming in, and that's just not San Francisco."
The backlash against tech companies has taken many forms. The most visible has been the battle over private buses, which companies like Google and Apple use to shuttle their workers from the city out to offices in the distant suburbs of Mountain View and Cupertino. The luxury vehicles, which have long used city bus stops to pick up and drop off workers, symbolized an elite that couldn't be bothered to deal with the city's underfunded and often strained municipal transit systems, the Muni and the Caltrain. Protesters in recent weeks prevented buses from parking, broke windows, and even began picketing tech employees at their homes. Google and Apple recently agreed to begin paying for their shuttles to use the public bus stops, but will only be shelling out $1 for each stop they make. "A dollar?" shouted activist Tommi Avicolli Mecca, the protest's master of ceremonies. "Why don't they charge the tech companies millions a year and make Muni free?"
Private buses symbolized separate worlds
Perhaps because this event involved startups, not established tech giants, the tone was more satirical and less vitriolic. On the street at the Crappies, a protester headed towards the stage to accept a golden toilet brush. "The tax evader award goes to... oh my god... Twitter!" proclaimed the MC, who wore a sparkly top hat for the occasion. Subsidies for firms like Twitter, which recently unleashed a new flood of millionaires into San Francisco's streets thanks to its IPO, have angered longtime residents who feel the companies don't give enough back. The award winner, waving his golden toilet brush, was dressed up to look like Twitter CEO Dick Costolo. "It's our town! We paid for it, we own it," he jeered. "I don't care if there are people here, that's progress, gramps. That's progress."
While rich techies no doubt drive up rents to some degree, another big part of the problem is that the housing supply simply hasn't kept up with demand. Over the last decade San Francisco has added more than 75,000 new residents, but only 15,000 new housing units have been built. The city's mayor, Ed Lee, has said he plans to add 30,000 new units in the next six years by increasing construction and repair. That will no doubt help, but unless there is a dramatic downturn in the Silicon Valley tech economy akin to the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000, the rising rents and influx of new residents are likely to continue.
The tech industry, which for a long time resisted letting itself become the scapegoat, has begun accepting some responsibility. Ron Conway, the hyperconnected investor often referred to as the "Godfather of Silicon Valley," took the stage to tell attendees that their companies have a responsibility to improve life in their neighborhoods. "I want to bring another, different challenge to the tech industry, and that's to make sure every person in our region has the opportunity to be a part of the new economy," Conway said. "We may not agree with everything the protesters outside have to say, but they do represent an anxiety over a widening income gap. My message tonight is that we — that means all of us — must be leaders in tackling the challenges in housing, transportation, and education. We are in this together."
"An anxiety over a widening income gap."
After Conway, Theresa Preston-Werner, founder and CEO of the Omakase Charity, took the stage and announced what she called the Tech Cares movement. She called on attendees to commit to donating at least $10 a month to Omakase, which benefits a different charity each month. "There's been a lot of criticism lobbied at the tech industry recently," she said. "People are saying tech is really closed off, that we're insulated. Maybe that's exactly what's happening here right now ... But I don't think that's really our real story."
It was an olive branch, to be sure, but the protesters weren't around to receive it. Last night, at least, the two sides seemed to be talking past one another. The protest crowd, which numbered around 60, barely interacted with the Crunchies crowd, and certainly didn't get to hear any of the solutions offered up to the audience filling the seats at the symphony. "It's not focusing on tech workers as scapegoats, but tech CEOs," said SF district supervisor Eric Mar, as the demonstration broke up. "I wish some of the progressive tech leadership would come out and show support."
This was another slow week for figures, it seems! But a slow week means less things to buy, which means more money saved! And, like always, there were some really spectacular figures, like Alter's Merry Nightmare and Kotobukiya's Lorna. But, as always, there were some total duds, including the most expensive OreImo figure yet and some surprising failures from Good Smile Company and Max Factory! So hit the jump and check out this week's offerings.
A+
Manami Tamura | 1/4.5 | ¥13,500 | November
AmiAmi | Hobby Search | HLJ
Leah: When I saw the thumbnail, I thought Manami was a prize figure or maybe from Movic. Which means cheap! But nope… it's a figure simpler than Wave's 1/10 Beach Queens for almost $200. Why? Who would ever buy this? And the saddest thing is that I know Manami doesn't have a chance at getting another figure.
Stephen: Who would ever want a 1/4.5 scale figure of Manami? She's the least popular of the Oreimo girls and seems like a really odd choice to make such a large and expensive figure of.
Alter
Merry Nightmare | 1/8 | ¥7,800 | February
AmiAmi | Hobby Search | HLJ
Leah: Merry is gorgeous, though I still like the face on MegaHouse's better. Everything else, though, Alter wins! The two are quite similar in terms of posing, so I'll be interested to see how they look in combination!
Stephen: I really love the flowing nature of Alter's Merry and she's just so cute! I can't wait until she arrives in February.
Good Smile Company
Kamui Kobayashi | Nendoroid | ¥3,500 | February
AmiAmi | Hobby Search | HLJ
Sena Kashiwazaki | Nendoroid | ¥3,500 | March
AmiAmi | Hobby Search
Leah: There's been a big move recently towards Nendoroids with tons of accessories and interesting faceplates. Then we have… this. A Nendoroid with ONE accessory (even though it seems like ideas for racing accessories would be plentiful…), only one face, and an interchangeable helmet. Not even a car like Racing Miku. Sena, however, is everything I want in a Nendo–cute figure, great faces, tons of accessories. And they're the same damn price!
Stephen: When I saw Nendoroid Kobayashi pop up, I was expecting the hot dog eating champion and got excited about the insane faces and accessories he would come with, but this is just disappointing. Yeah, you can put the racing helmet on other Nendoroids, but that's not worth his price point at all. Sena though is everything you'd want in a Nendoroid; cute faces, cute accessories, and great execution all around, so I guess for such a great Nendoroid we had to get a pretty crappy one as well.
Griffon
Millhoire F. Biscotti | 1/8 | ¥7,600 | December
AmiAmi | Hobby Search | HLJ
Leah: Millhoire is gorgeous, but… why December? I think we're going to have to squeeze her in, because this is one figure I can't resist.
Stephen: Millhoire looks amazing and this figure really just shows how much Griffon has improved of late.
Kaitendoh
Tamaki Kousaka Circuit Angel Red & Blue Versions | 1/6 | ¥9,500 | January
Red: AmiAmi | Hobby Search
Blue: AmiAmi | Hobby Search
Leah: There's no denying that Kaitendoh uses Tamaki as a blatant cash cow, but I'm not going to complain! This Circuit Angel version is a companion to the tiny 1/12 racing Tamaki released a while back, and she's quite cute looking. I've stopped buying multiple colorways of Tamakis, though, so I am going to have to pick just one.
Stephen: Tamaki looks really cute here! I'm loving the whole racing girl theme going on and both of these colorways are really great.
Kotobukiya
Lorna | 1/8 | ¥8,400 | February
AmiAmi | Hobby Search | HLJ
Leah: LORNA! Nevermind that not a single Japanese site can spell her name right, this wolf-maid has stolen my heart. I love Tony Taka's designs so much and Lorna is one of my favorites.
Stephen: Lorna is so amazing in every way possible. Her character design is great and as usual Kotobukiya did an excellent job translating her from Tony Taka's 2D art to 3D — I just don't know if one of her will be enough!
Max Factory
Kamui Kobayashi | figma | ¥3,000 | March
AmiAmi | Hobby Search | HLJ
Leah: ANOTHER figure of Kamui with minimal accessories and faces. It seems like almost no one is ordering these, so I fully expect them to hit the bargain bin. Oh, and get delayed for 6 months because they are 1) male and 2) based on a real person.
Stephen: A figma of a real life human male that no one outside of a few select people care about. I really have no clue why money was wasted on producing this, but if you ever want a racing body for your other figmas, expect this to hit bargain bins when it's inevitably released about a year later than scheduled.

Rei Ayanami | Real Action Hero 1/6 | ¥16,800 | October | Re-Release
AmiAmi
Leah: This is a lovely Rei, but I already have a lot of Reis and I certainly don't have an extra $200 lying around for this month's order.
Stephen: This Real Action Hero is great and one of the better figures of Rei, but it's also quite expensive and too late of an announcement for anyone to feasibly order her.

Leah: MegaHouse had some interesting releases this week, including a bunch of POPs that sold out far too quickly to include here. I only ended up ordering one of these, though–Izanagi. Gintoku looks great but not “I'll pay in January, the month of hell” great, and Branwen… well, I have some issues with her. Her face is gorgeous, but I detest the “enslaved warrior” title she has. So, pretty much on principle, Branwen is a no-buy.
Stephen: Izanagi is finally here! I really hope they continue the line as I'd love more static figures of the Personas. Gintoku is pretty cool, but I don't know the source material well enough to purchase him, and Branwen has a great face, but that's about it.

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Roughly 5 percent of North Carolina's magistrates are refusing to marry same-sex couples for religious reasons, and lawyers for the state say people suing in federal court have no standing to challenge this opt-outs as unconstitutional.
U.S. District Judge Max Cogburn scheduled a hearing for Monday in Asheville in part to consider a motion by the state to dismiss their lawsuit altogether. Separately, Republican legislative leaders and some magistrates also want to be added as defendants as the case, saying they don't trust Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper to defend the state law.
Three couples — two lesbian and one heterosexual — say taxpayer dollars are being spent to implement the 2015 opt-out law that treats them as second-class citizens and favors one set of religious views over another.
“It allows judicial officers to opt out of upholding the constitution,” said Jake Sussman, one of their attorneys. “We don't believe that the law appropriately balanced issues of religious liberty and these constitutional obligations.”
Now that Mississippi's broad religious-objection law is blocked in court, North Carolina and Utah are the only states enabling government officials to recuse themselves for religious reasons, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
If the law is struck down, religious freedom would be harmed not only in North Carolina but nationwide, particularly after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage nationally, another attorney says.
“What the United States Supreme Court did last year was a sea change,” and the government officials affected have a right to be protected, said Mat Staver, founder of the Florida-based Liberty Counsel. The legal aid group is representing Alexander County Magistrate Brenda Bumgarner, who wants to enter the lawsuit.
Bumgarner is among the 31 of the state's 670 magistrates who now have invoked the law. It exempts magistrates and certain workers in Register of Deeds offices from all marriage transactions — gay and heterosexual — for at least six months if they fill out a religious objection form. In North Carolina, Registers of Deeds offices issues marriage licenses while magistrates can officiate over a civil marriage.
State lawmakers approved this opt-out procedure in June 2015 after several magistrates resigned, feeling the state court system would punish or fire them if they didn't officiate at gay marriages. While the magistrates took oaths to defend the constitution and carry out laws, supporters of the law say they shouldn't have to scrap their strongly-held religious views at the same time.
The law provides for a chief District Court judge or county Register of Deeds — both elected officials —to carry out marriage transactions if no one else is available. Additional workers also can be brought in adjoining areas to fill in.
That's what's happened in McDowell County, just east of Asheville, where all magistrates opted out, according to the lawsuit. One of the lesbian couples who sued lives in McDowell County but is already married.
The lawsuit doesn't allege any delays or denials of marriage licenses due to the opt-out law, but says the second lesbian couple who sued is engaged and wishes for a magistrate to officiate in their marriage “untainted by the stigma of animus” arising from the recusals.
House Speaker Tim Moore, Senate leader Phil Berger, Bumgarner and other named magistrates argue that Cooper's public opposition to the law makes him a poor advocate to defend it. A federal magistrate judge disagreed in July, saying Cooper's office was mounting a vigorous case. Cooper is running this fall against Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, who vetoed the law but was overridden by the GOP-led legislature.
Cogburn, an appointee of President Barack Obama, was the first judge to formally strike down North Carolina's gay marriage ban in October 2014.

Bradley Smith chats exclusively to motogp.com about his brilliant 2015 and how he is planning on securing a factory contract for 2017.
Monster Yamaha Tech 3's Bradley Smith ended 2015 sixth in the MotoGP™ World Championship standings, won the Suzuka 8 Hours race and took a sensational podium in the wet at Misano.
Bradley, last year you had no illusions of the pressure you were under to secure your future in MotoGP™, with that in mind, it wasn't a bad season was it?
“Yeah it certainly was something to be proud of. I've never been one to let the pressure get to me so it just basically cleared my head, as what we needed to achieve was very clear...nothing short of perfection. Motorcycle racing itself is hard enough, but basically we managed to pull of a perfect season. We scored points in all 18 races and secured sixth overall in the championship, plus we won the Suzuka 8 Hours as well. I put myself under the pressure to get it done and I managed to. That was last year though, and we have to try and do it all again this season.”
After such a good performance last year, is there less pressure on you this season?
“There is and there isn't, because if anything this season has more riding on it as there is a chance to get a factory contract and to change your career with quite a big step. Last year I know I was just fighting to keep my ride within the Tech 3 team, this year I am fighting to put myself in the window of the factory teams. We are not sure which seats will become available, but this season I can actually gain even more from it. The fact is that there are 8-10 factory bikes available as everyone's contract is up for grabs at the end of the season. I actually feel there is more riding on this season, because it could really change the direction of my career. My ambition is to have a bike that is able to fight more regularly with the top riders. I have had two podiums so far in my MotoGP™ career and I want to add to that. This season is a chance to earn something that could be even brighter in the future, so I don't feel it is any different from last year.”
Do you think the new technical regulations for 2016 will help you to be able to close the gap to the factory riders and maybe even allow you to fight for victory?
“I think that looking to fight for race wins maybe isn't the right thing to say, but we are certainly looking to capitalise on a little bit of uncertainty at the beginning of the season. There is going to be more opportunities to sneak a podium or definitely a top five. I think that Qatar, Argentina, Austin and maybe even Jerez will be the four key races, as once we get back to Europe it will give manufacturers the chance to bring updates and the development ball will start rolling within the factory teams. Therefore we are really targeting the first four races as chance to sneak a result that people wouldn't expect.”
That could play into your hands nicely, as your team boss Hervé Poncharal has said that he feels most of the factory contracts will be signed based on the results in those first four races…
“Yeah, I would be very surprised if we don't see two or three of the top riders secure their contracts before the first round in Qatar. I think Valentino's (Rossi), Jorge's (Lorenzo) and Marc's (Marquez) contracts are pretty much a formality and with two or three seats already taken, that only leaves one or two other riders before I hope I would be in line for something. These first four races are a huge opportunity to showcase my potential and I am going to grab this opportunity with both hands and try and do my best.”
You were one of the few riders who didn't crash at the Valencia test on the new Michelins, yet at the Sepang test you became the first rider to crash during 2016…
“To be honest, I wouldn't say it was a planned crash but it was one I needed to get out of the way and I tried to do it in the safest place possible. I know that sounds really stupid and bizarre, but obviously there was a new spec of front tyre brought by Michelin and I was just seeing how hard I could brake and how much I could trail brake into the corner. I decided to basically play a little bit in turn 1, the hairpin at turn 9 and at the last corner, turn 15. I was going deeper and deeper on the brakes to try and find the limit and unfortunately I just ran a little bit wide on the dirty part of the track and down I went. I learnt the limit, I learnt where the feedback was and as you saw over the rest of the test there were no more hiccups. It was a little bit embarrassing because I was playing around more than I should, but fortunately there was no damage done.”
You did the most amount of laps of any rider at Sepang (179), how did you feel the test went overall?
“I was pumped that I had the fitness level to put the amount of laps in that I did! It is never easy to come back from 10 weeks away from a motorcycle and ride in Sepang with that heat and humidity. I tried to aim for 60 laps a day and I was happy with the work done. I think I was the only guy to do a race simulation as well, so there were lots of great positives to take from it. At the end of the second day I was happy with where I was in terms of the bike setting and feeling. My lap time was pretty much competitive with the other Yamahas around me, so I decided to spend the last day trying to work on the bigger picture for race days. Being able to do that first race simulation of the year gave my team a huge amount of data to look over and I believe that we will make two or three steps by the time we get to Phillip Island.
“I also tried the intermediate tyre. I had tried the intermediate tyre in Brno and at that stage it was more like a wet tyre, while the one they brought to Sepang behaved more like a slick. It was little bit nerve-racking, but it was easier for me to ride than in Misano last year. It was good to get some information for myself and also to give feedback to Michelin in terms of tyre development.”
Where do you see yourself at the end of the season?
“My aim is to try and finish in sixth again like I did last year. I don't think I need to expect more. Last season was an exceptional year, so if I can match that performance then that would be great. I would like to reduce the gap and battle a little bit more with the top five than I did last year, because I was a kind of lonely sixth most of the time. So if I can battle inside the top five that would be great, and if I can sneak another podium this year, that would also be great.”
Do you think it will be harder to achieve that with Ducati and Suzuki looking even stronger this year?
“It is certainly not going to be easy, but it never is! I think that the dynamic of racing is going to change a little bit this season. I think we will see guys showing exceptional one-lap pace in Qualifying, but we will wait and see if they can turn that into a performance in the race. One thing I know within my team and within Yamaha is that we excel on race day. I just need to keep working on my strengths and come through when the points are on the line on Sunday, when it really matters.”
On Thursday, President Barack Obama's public response to Wednesday night's mass shooting in a predominantly black church in Charleston, South Carolina, was quiet and somber. He spoke with sadness about the unique tragedy of such an act of violence taking place in a historic church with a rich history of struggle for African-American freedom.
Ultimately, though, he chose not to speak much about race. Instead, he focused on how the shooting at its core represents the nation's failure to control gun-related violence.
"Once again, innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun," Obama said. "At some point we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence doesn't happen in other advanced countries. It doesn't happen in other places with this type of frequency."
Some conservatives fixated on the first part of Obama's statement, and pushed back against the idea that mass shootings don't happen in other affluent countries. They're eager to remind the public that one of the worst shooting sprees in modern history transpired in Norway not too long ago.
American exceptionalism: But the key issue is what Obama added on at the end, the bit about frequency. And on that point, some experts think the the U.S. is indeed unique among its peer nations.
"If you look at the data, mass shootings events happen much more here in the U.S. than in other Western, developed nations," staff attorney Mike McLively of the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, told Mic.
This shouldn't be surprising. The rate of homicides caused by firearms in the U.S. dwarfs other countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development with the exception of Mexico, where the protracted war with drug cartels has left thousands dead. Data from a 2013 United Nations study shows how the U.S. stacks up against other developed countries:
The size and intensity of these shootings are enough to routinely captivate national attention. CBS White House reporter Mark Knoller estimates that the president has addressed the public about shootings at least 14 times during his presidency.
And South Carolina is particularly prone to these kinds of massacres.
"South Carolina is one of the states that gets an 'F' from our organization because their gun laws are very weak," McLively said. "It's no coincidence, we think, that they also have the fifth highest rate of gun homicide in the United States. And that pattern holds when you look at other states."
Many details about the shooting in South Carolina have yet to be confirmed, but when Obama spoke about how the nation's weak gun laws are tied to its unique gun violence, he was right.
White House and Pentagon officials, and particularly Vice President Cheney, were determined to attack Iraq from the first days of the Bush administration, long before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and repeatedly stretched available intelligence to build support for the war, according to a new book by former CIA director George J. Tenet.
Although Tenet does not question the threat Saddam Hussein posed or the sincerity of administration beliefs, he recounts numerous efforts by aides to Cheney and then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld to insert "crap" into public justifications for the war. Tenet also describes an ongoing fear within the intelligence community of the administration's willingness to "mischaracterize complex intelligence information."
"There was never a serious debate that I know of within the administration about the imminence of the Iraq threat," Tenet writes in "At the Center of the Storm," to be released Monday by HarperCollins. The debate "was not about imminence but about acting before Saddam did."
White House counselor Dan Bartlett yesterday called Tenet a "true patriot" but disputed his conclusions, saying "the president did wrestle with those very serious questions." Responding to reports from the book in yesterday's New York Times, Bartlett suggested that the former CIA director might have been unaware of all the discussions. President Bush, Bartlett said on NBC's "Today Show," "weighed all the various consequences before he did make a decision."
In their threat briefings for the incoming Bush administration in late 2000, Tenet writes, CIA officials did not even mention Iraq. But Cheney, he says, asked for an Iraq briefing and requested that the outgoing Clinton administration's defense secretary, William S. Cohen, provide information on Iraq for Bush.
A speech by Cheney in August 2002 "went well beyond what our analysis could support," Tenet writes. The speech charged, among other things, that Hussein had restarted his nuclear program and would "acquire nuclear weapons fairly soon . . . perhaps within a year." Caught off-guard by the remarks, which had not been cleared by the CIA, Tenet says he considered confronting the vice president on the subject but did not.
"Would that have changed his future approach?" he asks. "I doubt it but I should not have let silence imply an agreement." Policymakers, he writes, "have a right to their own opinions, but not their own set of facts."
New details about the origins of the current terrorist threat -- and the way the Clinton and Bush White Houses dealt with it -- add to a growing body of information about the tumultuous late 1990s and the first years of the new century. For the future, Tenet describes his deepest fear as "the nuclear one." He is convinced, he writes, that this is where Osama bin Laden "and his operatives desperately want to go. They understand that bombings by cars, trucks, trains and planes will get them some headlines, to be sure. But if they manage to set off a mushroom cloud, they will make history."
Despite all efforts to thwart them, he says, "I do know one thing in my gut: al-Qa'ida is here and waiting."
The book breaks Tenet's long public silence since he resigned in June 2004 over what he considered White House attempts to turn him into a scapegoat, as U.S. efforts in Iraq were bogging down, for the faulty intelligence used to justify the invasion in the first place.
Tenet writes that Bush talked him out of resigning in May 2003. But he decided it was time to go nine months later when a book by The Washington Post's Bob Woodward quoted him as telling Bush in December 2002 that the intelligence case against Iraq was a "slam dunk," a statement he says was taken out of context but subsequently used by the administration to blame him for faulty Iraq intelligence. "I couldn't quit immediately over something that appeared in a book," Tenet writes, "but I didn't see any way I could or should stay on much longer." Bush made no attempt to keep him when he finally resigned in June 2004.
Tenet blames himself, among other things, for the hastily compiled October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate, which concluded that Iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons, issued on the eve of a congressional vote authorizing the war. The NIE, he said, "should have been initiated earlier. I didn't think one was necessary. I was wrong." The document, he acknowledged, was "not cautious in key judgments" and at times used single sources who turned out to be wrong.
A perennial problem, he writes, was a tendency by intelligence analysts to assume other people thought like they did. When judging whether Hussein was lying when he said Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, "we did not account for . . . the mind set never to show weakness in a very dangerous neighborhood."
One of the "lowest moments of my seven-year tenure," Tenet recalls, was when a congressman told him in a public hearing in the spring of 2004 that "we depended on you, and you let us down."
Tenet's account of his CIA years moves through explanation, accusation, defensiveness and occasional apology. When he became acting director in December 1996, Tenet writes, he found an agency "in shambles," its budget slashed, its recruiting moribund and its morale "in the basement." Analysis and clandestine operations had deteriorated, and there was "no coherent, integrated and measurable long-range plan. That's where I focused my energy from day one."
Much of the first half of the book is a detailed account of what Tenet describes as efforts by himself and his lieutenants to meet the emerging al-Qaeda threat and to convince the White House to take aggressive action. Rejecting later criticism of CIA foot-dragging, Tenet writes that "after 9/11 some senior government officials contended that they were surprised at the size and nature of the attacks. Perhaps so, but they shouldn't have been. We had been warning about the threat at every opportunity."
He titles one chapter of the 549-page book "Missed Opportunities," but Tenet misses few opportunities himself to settle scores with Cheney and Rumsfeld and their top aides, and with Bush's first-term national security adviser and current secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice. He characterizes Rice as a "remote" figure who "knew the president's mind well but tended to stay out of policy fights." Under Rice, he says, the National Security Council failed to explore options and reach consensus. Rumsfeld, he says, refused to recognize worsening reality in Iraq and on several occasions undercut CIA efforts with cavalier treatment of secret information.
By contrast, Tenet's treatment of Bush, who presented Tenet with a Medal of Freedom six months after his departure, is relatively gentle. He says he and others sometimes failed to give Bush the information he needed. "The president was not well served," he says by way of example, "because the NSC became too deferential to a postwar strategy that was not working."
Tenet writes defensively about the controversial program to intercept domestic telephone calls involving terrorism suspects. The program was Cheney's idea, and the vice president briefed "the leaders of the House and Senate Intelligence committees 12 times prior to its public disclosure" in late 2005.
He reiterates a claim last year by Bush that the CIA's harsh interrogations of captured al-Qaeda figures "helped disrupt plots aimed at locations in the United States, the United Kingdom, the Middle East, South Asia, and Central Asia." He says the agency used "the most aggressive" techniques -- which he does not detail -- on "a handful of the worst terrorists on the planet" and that the questioning was "carefully monitored at all times to ensure the safety of the prisoner."
Tenet describes as "baloney" a claim made in a book last year by journalist Ron Suskind that the agency overstated the value of intelligence collected from al-Qaeda operative Abu Zubaida, whom Suskind depicted as "mentally unstable." Zubaida, Tenet says, was central to many al-Qaeda operations and shared "critical information with his interrogators." Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed, he says, initially told interrogators that he would talk only after seeing a lawyer in the United States. "Had that happened," Tenet writes, "I am confident that we would have obtained none of the information he had in his head about imminent threats against the American people."
Al-Qaeda has responded to the U.S. intelligence focus on young Arab men as potential risks, he says, by recruiting "jihadists with different backgrounds. I am convinced the next major attack against the United States may well be conducted by people with Asian or African faces, not the ones that many Americans are alert to."
Staff writers Walter Pincus and R. Jeffrey Smith and staff researcher Julie Tate contributed to this report.
In her regular weekend column for the WSJ, Peggy Noonan waxes her usual eloquent on Obama's vacant and clueless reaction to Paris. And in that typical eloquence she says something extraordinary:
After the attacks Mr. Obama went on TV, apparently to comfort us and remind us it's OK, he's in charge. He prattled on about violence being at odds with “universal values.” He proceeded as if unaware that there are no actually universal values, that right now the values of the West and radical Islam are clashing, violently, and we have to face it. [emphasis added]
Let that sink in for just a minute – there are no universal values. Values have to be cultivated and promoted and defended. They must be cherished and passed on generation to generation. Values must be institutionalized and preserved. They must be personalized and held close to our hearts. Anything less and they simply wither, like a volunteer tomato plant the year after you planted them.
That Obama is clueless about this is old news. What concerns me is if the American people know this. Noonan went on in her piece to say, “…Hillary Clinton Thursday delivered a speech on her strategy to face the current crisis; it sounded a lot like Mr. Obama's strategy, whatever that is. ” One of the major candidates for the presidency is as clueless about values and their care as the current president and yet she tends to out poll the current GOP crop, barely. What Obama's re-election (fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me) and Hillary's current standing in the polls tells us is that a very significant number of Americans have failed to cultivate values in themselves and their loved ones.
We left it to the institutions and failed to support them as they rotted from within. (Do you need more evidence of this fact than what is happening in universities across the land in the last few weeks?) We have failed to cherish Western values in ourselves, choosing the easy path. We decided we did not need church if we were “just good people,” never realizing that it was church that helped us to understand what it meant to be good people and church that lent us the strength to execute it. Either that or we morphed church into something that felt good, but never really got down to business.
The cultivation and preservation of values requires the efforts of each of us. We all play a role in it, with our children, our loved ones, in our communities, clubs and congregations. It is a big giant machine in which we all have a function. And like any machine, it requires maintenance to continue to function well. It is funny how a car can be stopped dead in its tracks by the smallest part. We have all assumed we were a small and insignificant part when in fact we have the power to bring the whole value machine to a halt, and we are very close to doing so.
Noonan's remarkable observation is not really so remarkable save that we have forgotten it. We are now confronted with a choice. We can sit here and lament it, blaming the next person or we can get busy. I vote for gettin' busy.
The Lord of the Rings Trilogy had its time in the spotlight, with three epic movies, several computer and board games and a handful of albums. By comparison, its predecessor, The Hobbit, has hidden largely in the shadows. Today marks the 75 anniversary of that humble, hobbity beginning.
Published on September 21st, 1937, The Hobbit was born into critical acclaim. It was nominated for a Carnegie Medal, and won a prize for best juvenile fiction from the New York Herald Tribune. Here's the dustcover for that first edition, apparently based on a design by Tokein himself.
In fact, Tolkien was reported to be extremely involved in the design and illustration of the books, so much so that his editors joked about it. One of his publishers, Rayner Unwin, said: “In 1937 alone Tolkien wrote 26 letters to George Allen & Unwin… detailed, fluent, often pungent, but infinitely polite and exasperatingly precise… I doubt any author today, however famous, would get such scrupulous attention.”
But Tolkein had a very specific idea for how the story should look and went so far as to include a set of illustrations he had drawn. Those illustrations have never been published before, but The Guardian has a sneak peek at them.
Because The Hobbit was so successful, his publishers asked Tolkein for more. Tolkein, apparently, wrote a draft for a book called The Silmarillion. The Silmarillion moves away from hobbits and travels to the universe of Era—a universe that contains Middle-earth but also other lands like Valinor, Beleriand and Numenor. The publishers rejected The Silmarillion, figuring the people wanted more about hobbits, not a story about some land distant to them. So Tolkein began writing what he called “The New Hobbit” which would eventually turn into the beloved Lord of the Rings trilogy.
Fans might be surprised to find that the version of The Hobbit that they know and love doesn't exactly match the text of the book's first edition. Remember the riddle game that Bilbo and Gollum play deep in the goblin caves? You probably remember how it ended—Bilbo beats Gollum by stumping him, and when Gollum realizes what he's lost, he panics and chases Bilbo through the caves. His final words in The Hobbit are “Thief! Thief, Baggins! We hate it, we hate it, we hate it forever!” Well in the very first edition of the book, that's not what happens at all. In fact, Bilbo and Gollum part peacefully. Gollum admits that he's been beat, and lets Bilbo go on his way. Tolkein had to change that chapter to fit with the later trilogies, in which Gollum returns and seeks the ring.
Tolkien also tried to change the entire tone of The Hobbit to fit the more serious trilogy. But he gave up after the third chapter, saying it “just wasn't The Hobbit” any longer without its playful tone and quick pace.
And it's probably just as well, for fans of The Hobbit wouldn't have the book any other way. They founded the Tolkien Society and have declared tomorrow Hobbit Day, the day when both Bilbo and Frodo were born.
In large part, Hobbit Day is usually taken up with the fun activities – the feasts, games, costume events, fireworks and the like. Hobbit Day is a virtually ideal holiday, incorporating attractive elements of several others: the masquerade fun of Halloween, the feast of Thanksgiving, the exchange of greeting cards and gifts associated with Christmas and birthdays, the picnic atmosphere of Labor Day and Memorial Day, the fireworks of Independence Day (or Guy Fawkes Day)… and the study and reflection associated with many commemorative days throughout the year.
In just a few months, part one of the live action Hobbit will hit a movie screen near you. The movie will actually be three movies, expanding The Hobbit out into its own epic journey. Peter Jackson, the director, had this to say about the way the movies are coming together:
We know how much of the story of Bilbo Baggins, the Wizard Gandalf, the Dwarves of Erebor, the rise of the Necromancer, and the Battle of Dol Guldur will remain untold if we do not take this chance. The richness of the story of The Hobbit, as well as some of the related material in the appendices of The Lord of the Rings, allows us to tell the full story of the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and the part he played in the sometimes dangerous, but at all times exciting, history of Middle-earth. So, without further ado and on behalf of New Line Cinema, Warner Bros. Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Wingnut Films, and the entire cast and crew of “The Hobbit” films, I'd like to announce that two films will become three.
Here's the official trailer:
But four different trailers were actually released, each with an alternate ending depending on which character you follow. Bleeding Cool compiled them all for you:
From Hollywood to the Shire, let's all wish Bilbo and The Hobbit a happy 75th birthday.

Local officials also mull a ban on import of foreign offerings that "distort historic facts."
MOSCOW – Russian authorities said they will produce "patriotic" video games, while import of foreign video games that "distort history" could be banned.
"The main thing we expect from the producers of video games is the realistic and historically truthful representation of events," Arseny Mironov, an aide to Russia's culture minister Vladimir Medinsky, was quoted as saying by the Russian daily Izvestiya. He added that the creation of a "negative image of the Russian warrior" is inadmissible.
"A video game has to have not only an entertainment value, but it also has to teach and be conducive to patriotic education," he went on to say.
The Russian Military History Society, which is headed by Medinsky, is to be in charge of the government's video game project. The first video game being developed will focus on the inception of Russian military aviation during the First World War. The video game is to be inaugurated in 2014, and the government is currently in negotiations with several local video game developers, but no names have been revealed.
Later, government grants for development of "patriotic" video games are to be introduced.
The culture ministry also expressed concerns about foreign video games, which "discredit the Russian soldier" and "distort historic facts" and said that import of those games to Russia could be banned.
Among the examples, the video game "Company of Heroes," developed by Relic Entertainment, was mentioned. Russian officials have complained that the game, which isn't translated into Russian, is popular among Russian teenagers, although it depicts a Russian WWII soldier as a criminal who burns down civilians' houses.
Incidentally, You Don't Mess With Putin, a mobile video game in which Russian President Vladimir Putin fights a horde of zombies, is being developed by Belgium's Michele Rocco Smeets.
The Vikings did not play Adrian Peterson in either of their first two preseason games. Add to that the fact that Teddy Bridgewater did not play in their second preseason game. Shaun Hill is a very similar style of QB to Bridgewater, relying on accuracy and the ability to read defenses rather than arm strength and moxie, so the style of offense went without change, but without Peterson in the game, this was not the offense of the Minnesota Vikings. Seattle of course brought one of the best defenses in the NFL and a solid time-of-possession style offense, giving the Viking starters a stiff test for as long as they were on the field. In case this is your first of these articles, I am not giving you a play by play review of the game, but a bird's eye view of where the position groups of the division opponent have looked in preseason, and how the Lions match up with them.
http://gty.im/457126634
Running Backs
Jerick McKinnon is clearly not a starter in the NFL. He will make a reasonable change of pace back, with packages that get him the ball in space, but up the middle he is nearly as bad as Theo Riddick has been for the Lions. Matt Astasia is very similar to a lot of the Lions' other backs, not being the quickest guy, but will reliably get 0.5 yards more than the blocking gets him by carrying the guy who tackles him that far on his way down.
http://gty.im/460467686
Wide Receivers
The Vikings have a deep but not exactly great receiver corps. Charles Johnson and Stefon Diggs are likely to see the majority of snaps until Laquon Treadwell figures out how to use his body at the NFL level, but those two are a reasonable set of targets in this short passing offense. Cordarrelle Patterson will likely see a few packages, and will definitely be on the field when the Vikings need to go deep as their only speedster. This week the Vikings' starters, with their back up quarterback, against the best secondary in the NFL, looked predictably unproductive.
Tight End
Kyle Rudolph and MyCole Pruitt are the locks for the one and two spots, with my personal favorite tight end of the 2016 draft David Morgan III as the likely third blocking specialist. The tight end is all but an afterthought in this offense, with Rudolph likely having Pro Bowl talent, but no opportunity to put up flashy stats. When the wide receivers are all catching short passes, there isn't a lot of room for a tight end to work. He is a dangerous weapon, but is primarily a blocker for this team.
http://gty.im/489330188
Offensive Line
A lot of offensive lines have looked bad against the Seattle defense, and the Vikings had their moments as well. I am not racist, and will thus not tell you that a mobile Teddy Bridgewater (which is not a thing) will help cover their deficiency, as you may read elsewhere. Running the ball, the Vikings' offensive line had trouble getting any push in straight up man blocking plays, having a lot more success in traps and outside runs. Some of that is on McKinnon not being willing to explode in to the holes that were there, but most of it was that their line did not match up well.
So How Does the Lions Defense Match Up Against the Vikings Offense?
The entire key to stopping the Vikings revolves around stopping the greatest child abus… I mean running back in Vikings franchise history, Adrian Peterson. The Vikings' offense just does not have a good enough quarterback or receivers to take advantage of the stacked boxes that Adrian Peterson gives them to work with. If anything that just puts more bodies in the same areas they are trying to throw the ball in to. DeAndre Levy's health is the key to this match up. If the Lions are able to stay in base defense against Minnesota's three wide sets with Levy covering the slow footed Treadwell, they can keep a third linebacker on the field, and be more effective against Peterson. This is a tactic the Lions often used in 2014, and tried but failed to use without Levy in 2015 in the opening weeks of the season. I seem really obvious, on a running play I would rather have Kyle Van Noy on the field than Quandre Diggs. I like the Lions' defense against the Vikings' offense.
Linebackers
Anthony Barr is a very good player. Chad Greenway is a very good player. Eric Kendricks looked pretty good as a rookie playing something other than his natural fit in the Vikings defense. These guys are going to be very good against screens, with Greenway and Kendricks both being more skilled coverage than run stopping linebackers.
http://gty.im/524955634
Defensive Backs
The Vikings have a pretty good secondary going in to the 2015 season. their corner situation improved greatly, with the addition of Terence Newman in 2015. While he's old he still has the closing speed that has been his trademark as a pro, and he showed it off early against the Seahawks. The Vikings have a pretty solid group of corners, and it runs four deep with Xavier Rhodes, Captain Munnerlyn and Trae Waynes all legitimate NFL players, and second round rookie Mackensie Alexander likely to work his way up that chain as the season runs along.
Defensive Line
The Vikings' defensive line is very dangerous but Seattle was fairly successful in straight up run blocking their starters. That's not a great sign, as the Seattle line is not very good. The Vikings had to blitz against the run to get players in to the backfield, which is not ideal. their pass rush however looked as good as it should, with SLB Anthony Barr dropping down to the line of scrimmage on pass plays and providing a flamethrower off the edge across from Griffin on numerous occasions.

How Does the Lions Defense Match Up With the Vikings Defense?
The Lions' offensive line has been having trouble run blocking, and has had trouble protecting the quarterback, and that's a problem. Early in the preseason it looks like running the ball to set up play action against their aggressive defensive backs and linebackers is the way to beat this Vikings defense. Ameer Abdullah is going to be the key to the Lions' offense against the Vikings. He is the only running back on the Lions roster that can get to the second level of a defense with poor blocking in front of him. Theo Riddick was less than productive against the Vikings last season, and the duo of Greenway and Kendricks were the reason why. Basically unless the Lions figure out their blocking issues, this is going to be a case of strength vs strength, and weakness vs weakness. the Vikings can be run on, but not with impunity, they need to be overpowered. The Lions' receivers against the Vikings' defense looks like an interesting match up, but if Stafford is under duress, as he was continuously last season vs. the Vikings, the Lions' receivers don't matter as much. In short, at this point I don't love way the Lions' offense matches up against the Vikings' defense.
http://gty.im/457126604
Lions vs. Vikings
The Vikings are the best team in the division, and I have trouble picking the Lions to beat them on the road. Both of these games happen in November, making an August prediction completely worthless, but I think that the Lions best hope against this team is a split, with a loss on the road, and a victory at home on thanksgiving.

Clouds may have been the inspiration behind Edvard Munch's The Scream. A new paper by researchers in Olso postulates that a phenomenon known as “mother-of-pearl” clouds may have occurred around the time that Munch painted his iconic image in 1893, leading scientists to believe that their bright red formations were what the artist depicted.
The hypothesis, publicized in a report by AFP, comes after a 2004 theory in which American astronomers asserted that the 1883 Krakatoa volcano eruption had been the springboard for the painting. But particle pollution from an eruption would not explain the “waviness” of the sky Munch portrayed, says Helene Muri, a researcher at the University of Oslo.
In Munch's private writings, he recounted a single experience with chilling intensity, describing a sky that suddenly turned blood red. “Munch's scary vision was seemingly a one-time experience, the way he described it in his journal,” Muri elaborates.
Nacreous clouds—also known as “mother-of-pearl” clouds—only materialize during very cold temperatures in high altitudes in winter, and their thinness renders them visible only during the nighttime. Muri thinks they are “so beautiful you could believe you are in another world.”
“We do know that there were mother-of-pearl clouds in the Oslo area in the late 19th century,” she says, according to at least one scientist who recorded their presence at the time.
“Edvard Munch could well have been terrified when the sky all of a sudden turned ‘bloodish red,'” the scientists write. “Hence, there is a high probability that it was an event of mother-of-pearl clouds which was the background for Munch's experience in nature, and for his iconic Scream.”
“There are other hypotheses,” says Muri. “But of course, we are natural scientists, we tend to look for answers in nature, while the psychologists have suggested it was inner torment that made Munch paint The Scream.“

During a recent town hall meeting for Argonauts season-ticket holders, a fan asked club management when they planned to make BMO Field their home, and not just a place to play. Where was the Argos signage, and the giant “A” painted at midfield?
The Argonauts had hoped the move to BMO Field from the Rogers Centre would spark interest. When the crowds didn't meet expectations, they moved to plan B of what they're now labelling a rebuild. ( Carlos Osorio / Toronto Star file photo )
And where were the championship banners? Team president Michael Copeland assured everyone present that banners honouring the club's 16 Grey Cup wins would appear this season. But when crowds will show up at the Argos' new home is a critical issue with implications for the entire Canadian Football League.
Article Continued Below
The Argos are the CFL's oldest club and occupy its biggest market, home to both potential fans and corporate support. But four seasons without a playoff win have led to fan apathy that shrinks the entire league's footprint. Last season's league-wide attendance averaged 24,692, compared with just 16,380 in Toronto. Factor out the Argos and the figure jumps to 25,730. The Argos enter their second season at BMO cognizant that overcoming inertia at home could restore the team's relevance and boost business for the whole CFL. “This is a rebuild; there's no other way to put it,” Copeland says. “The health of all our franchises is important in a nine-team league. Everybody is aware of it and has been for quite some time.” The CFL isn't alone in trying to convert a major-market team's glorious history into sustained ticket sales. Attendance is down at New York Yankees games even though the iconic club entered this weekend leading the American League East. While the Bronx Bombers cite high ticket and luxury-suite prices, they also acknowledge that they've struggled to solve millennials' buying habits and market their product accordingly.
“Baseball, I think, has somewhat struggled with the millennial problem,” Yankees executive Hal Steinbrenner told the New York Times. “We recognized in looking at our fan base, we recognized in looking at our (television) viewers, that that age group is not what it could be and not what it should be.” MLB's revenue-sharing program spreads contributions among 30 teams, mitigating damage when big earners such as the Yankees have a slow year.

But with just nine teams, the CFL feels a single team's struggles more acutely. If the Argos had averaged 20,000 fans at BMO last season the league average would have jumped by 402 spectators per game. Attracting 22,000 per game would have pushed the overall average from 24,692 to 25,316. The league realizes the Argos, who lost 13 of 18 games last year, can correct that by winning more often. “In a nine-team league with a four-team East Division, it doesn't do anyone any good for games to become meaningless,” says CFL board chairman Jim Lawson. “Everybody is pulling for the Argos. Everybody wants some parity.” Boosting attendance remains an uphill struggle for the Argos. Copeland says season-ticket sales trail last year's pace, but adds that's normal in post-Grey Cup years, as buyers who signed up mainly to get Cup tickets let their subscriptions lapse. Toronto hosted the Grey Cup last year, coinciding with the Argos' move to BMO. But as another town-hall attendee pointed out during the Q&A session, the club's core season-ticket holders skew white and Anglo and middle-aged. A 2015 poll conducted for the Star by Forum Research showed the Argos ranked last among local pro teams in popularity among 18- to 35-year-olds. Copeland recognizes growing that base means making it younger and more diverse, and says the move to BMO Field was meant to address that issue. But a lacklustre 2016 dulled any buzz the club had generated by relocating to Liberty Village, and making the Argos relevant again remains this season's challenge. The club has hired a group sales co-ordinator and increased its marketing staff, hoping to target casual sports fans while engaging non-traditional football audiences. “We want people to say, ‘I want to be a part of that brand. That reflects who I am,' ” Copeland says. “We're focused on the game experience . . . (and) we have the ability to deliver the experience at BMO Field. We think we're going to have a lot of repeat customers.” The last time the Argos changed home fields, big crowds followed. In 1989, the team's first year at the stadium then known as SkyDome, the Argos averaged a league-best 35,069 at home games. Two seasons later, a team stacked with stars such as Mike Clemons and Raghib (Rocket) Ismail again led in attendance, drawing 36,304 fans on average to home games and winning the Grey Cup. Back then, the Argos didn't compete with Toronto FC and the Raptors for fan and sponsor support, points out former club president Brian Cooper. He also says Clemons, Ismail and later quarterback Doug Flutie did for the Argos what Jozy Altidore and Sebastian Giovinco are doing for TFC — boosting the franchise's profile and value by driving on-field success. “Without the Argos being relevant, it hurts (the CFL) and they need to step it up,” says Cooper, who now runs the sport and entertainment consultancy MKTG. “The best formula for becoming relevant: start winning. You're going to have to spend some money, but in relative terms to other leagues it's not that much money… I would spend more money on players than I would on marketing, because once you start winning it all falls into place.” But where the MLS designated-player rule allowed TFC to lure stars from other leagues, the Argos are bound by a strict salary cap that prevents them from splurging on another Rocket Ismail-type ticket-selling star. Instead, the club overhauled its football operations this off-season, betting general manager Jim Popp and head coach Marc Trestman can rejuvenate the on-field product. The pair combined for two Grey Cups with the Montreal Alouettes before Trestman left to coach the Chicago Bears in 2013. In a four-team East Division that saw every club post a losing record last season, Copeland realizes a playoff berth — and the ticket sales that come with it — are only a few small improvements away. “This isn't an ‘if you build it, they will come' situation,” Copeland says. “Now, it's about execution.”

Toronto FC took on the Montreal Impact on Wednesday evening in front of over 22,000 fans at BMO Field. The preliminary round of the Amway Canadian Championship was everything fans could have wanted - and then some.
With Toronto's three designated players out, many expected it to be an uphill battle, with a line-up fueled by the club's youngsters. To the delight of the Toronto FC faithful, the Reds came out strong, with two first-half goals by Jonathan Osorio. The second half was much of the same, as Jordan Hamilton stepped up to the plate and scored his first two goals in competitive play for TFC. They proved to be the game winner and the icing on the cake. The Impact went on to score two late goals in the final five minutes of play, with the game finishing a 4-2 victory for Toronto FC. Here are Waking the Red photographer, Luke Galati's best 40 photos from the match.
ELLIE is a psychologist, and a damned good one at that. Smile in a certain way, and she knows precisely what your smile means. Develop a nervous tic or tension in an eye, and she instantly picks up on it. She listens to what you say, processes every word, works out the meaning of your pitch, your tone, your posture, everything. She is at the top of her game but, according to a new study, her greatest asset is that she is not human.
When faced with tough or potentially embarrassing questions, people often do not tell doctors what they need to hear. Yet the researchers behind Ellie, led by Jonathan Gratch at the Institute for Creative Technologies, in Los Angeles, suspected from their years of monitoring human interactions with computers that people might be more willing to talk if presented with an avatar. To test this idea, they put 239 people in front of Ellie (pictured above) to have a chat with her about their lives. Half were told (truthfully) they would be interacting with an artificially intelligent virtual human; the others were told (falsely) that Ellie was a bit like a puppet, and was having her strings pulled remotely by a person.

Designed to search for psychological problems, Ellie worked with each participant in the study in the same manner. She started every interview with rapport-building questions, such as, “Where are you from?” She followed these with more clinical ones, like, “How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?” She finished with questions intended to boost the participant's mood, for instance, “What are you most proud of?” Throughout the experience she asked relevant follow-up questions—“Can you tell me more about that?” for example—while providing the appropriate nods and facial expressions.
Lie on the couch, please
During their time with Ellie, all participants had their faces scanned for signs of sadness, and were given a score ranging from zero (indicating none) to one (indicating a great degree of sadness). Also, three real, human psychologists, who were ignorant of the purpose of the study, analysed transcripts of the sessions, to rate how willingly the participants disclosed personal information.
These observers were asked to look at responses to sensitive and intimate questions, such as, “How close are you to your family?” and, “Tell me about the last time you felt really happy.” They rated the responses to these on a seven-point scale ranging from -3 (indicating a complete unwillingness to disclose information) to +3 (indicating a complete willingness). All participants were also asked to fill out questionnaires intended to probe how they felt about the interview.
Dr Gratch and his colleagues report in Computers in Human Behaviour that, though everyone interacted with the same avatar, their experiences differed markedly based on what they believed they were dealing with. Those who thought Ellie was under the control of a human operator reported greater fear of disclosing personal information, and said they managed more carefully what they expressed during the session, than did those who believed they were simply interacting with a computer.
Crucially, the psychologists observing the subjects found that those who thought they were dealing with a human were indeed less forthcoming, averaging 0.56 compared with the other group's average score of 1.11. The first group also betrayed fewer signs of sadness, averaging 0.08 compared with the other group's 0.12 sadness score.
This quality of encouraging openness and honesty, Dr Gratch believes, will be of particular value in assessing the psychological problems of soldiers—a view shared by America's Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, which is helping to pay for the project.
Soldiers place a premium on being tough, and many avoid seeing psychologists at all costs. That means conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to which military men and women are particularly prone, often get dangerous before they are caught. Ellie could change things for the better by confidentially informing soldiers with PTSD that she feels they could be a risk to themselves and others, and advising them about how to seek treatment.
If, that is, a cynical trooper can be persuaded that Ellie really isn't a human psychologist in disguise. Because if Ellie can pass for human, presumably a human can pass for Ellie.
Listen to this interview...
Today, Mussel Slough doesn't show up on many maps of the San Joaquin Valley. But in 1880, this small settlement northwest of Hanford was the site of one of the bloodiest gunfights in the Old West. It pitted a group of Kings County farmers against the powerful Southern Pacific Railroad in a fight for their land.
In the end seven people were dead and the gunfight made national headlines, eventually inspiring countless newspaper and historical accounts. It also gave birth to several fictionalized accounts of the fight, turning the events of Mussel Slough into a powerful Western myth. They included the famous novel "The Octopus" by Frank Norris.
This week on Valley Edition we look at both the fact and fiction of this often overlooked portion of our local history with Santa Clara University English professor Terry Beers, author of the book "Gunfight At Mussel Slough: Evolution of a Western Myth." In it Beers talks about how the truth of what happened on May 11, 1880 is significantly more complex than the conventional narrative, and how the event captured the interest of the nation.
The U.K. government is set to announce measures to force internet service providers to maintain records of which customers use which IP addresses, so as to make online anonymity more difficult.
The details of how this is to be achieved are yet to be announced, but reports on Sunday noted that the measures will form part of a wider anti-terrorism bill that's due to be introduced on Wednesday. The IP addresses that ISPs assign to their customers are often shared and also sometimes reset when they turn equipment off and on again. In theory, this move would make it easier to link an IP address known to have been used in a specific communication to a specific device.

Terrorists aside, the Home Office wants IP matching to help identify and prosecute online bullies, hackers and so on, and identify children who have “threatened over social media to commit suicide.”
Nonetheless, home secretary Theresa May is annoyed at the Liberal Democrats, her Conservative Party's junior coalition partner, for blocking moves to reintroduce a repeatedly floated, and repeatedly shot-down, “Snooper's Charter” – more properly known as the Communications Data Bill.
This would force service providers to retain users' web metadata to allow greater state surveillance of what people do online – something that is at least theoretically enabled by the DRIP Act that was recently rushed through Parliament, but only on a temporary basis until 2016. While the Lib Dems have consistently opposed this, they have long supported IP matching.
“The Home Office had gone quiet on the issue of IP address matching until it resurfaced as a result of deeply misleading claims made in Theresa May's Conference speech,” the Lib Dems said in a self-congratulatory blog post on Sunday. “May accused the Liberal Democrats of putting children's lives at risk by blocking the Snoopers' Charter, citing cases dropped by the National Crime Agency. In fact it was the failure to match IP addresses that led to the failure of those cases.”
The move has also received a cautious welcome from the likes of Big Brother Watch and veteran Conservative rebel and civil liberties activist David Davis — with the conditions that its use has proper oversight and isn't a bridge towards the reintroduction of the Snooper's Charter, which May clearly wants.
The home secretary said in a statement emailed to me by the Home Office:
Loss of the capabilities on which we have always relied is the great danger we face. The Bill provides the opportunity to resolve the very real problems that exist around IP resolution and is a step in the right direction towards bridging the overall communications data capability gap But I believe that we need to make further changes to the law. It is a matter of national security and we must keep on making the case for the Communications Data Bill until we get the changes we need… This data will only be available on a case by case basis, where necessary and proportionate, to public bodies approved by Parliament to acquire it for lawful purposes.
It appears that this would be an evidential tool as much as anything else; something to prove that a person accessed unlawful content, once their IP address has been found communicating with the server of that content. In a separate move, British ISPs recently agreed to stop people from seeing “extremist” material online.
Linking IP addresses to devices would certainly make for tighter evidence, though arguably not always enough to link a specific person to specific content and communications, as some devices are shared. Who knows: perhaps the move might wake the U.K. authorities' draconian copyright enforcement powers from their current slumber.
It would be premature to pass judgement on the IP address-matching move without seeing the details (tech lawyer Graham Smith reckons it might involve port number retention), but while IP matching may in itself be unobjectionable – and perhaps even to be welcomed in certain cases — there can be great value in anonymous web usage, from intellectual exploration to whistleblowing. As these measures could and sometimes should be circumvented, I'm concerned about whether the government intends to crack down on anonymizing services such as VPNs and Tor.
Ultimately, the real danger lies in how the practice might be used in conjunction with other, more authoritarian laws, such as the aforementioned DRIP Act and the data retention law it bolsters, RIPA. Unfortunately, UK law enforcement legislation has a nasty tendency to be used for purposes that weren't originally on the menu, such as RIPA being used to uncover journalists' sources and spy on lawyer-client communications. On IP matching, the devil may be in the details.
We are remiss in not having written about the Peter Gleick scandal. Gleick is a founder of the liberal Pacific Institute and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He is an expert on water resources, not climate. Like many left-wingers in irrelevant fields of study, he has irrationally strong feelings about global warming. So, as Gleick has now admitted, he obtained documents from the Heartland Institute under false pretenses–that is, by lying–and published them in hopes of discrediting the Institute.
The Heartland Institute is a superb organization that deals with a number of issues, including climate science. We have cited Heartland's research many times. Gleick published various internal Heartland documents that were genuine, including private information about donors, etc. He has now apologized, sort of, for his wrongdoing.
Before Gleick apologized, however, the liberal media had a field day with his supposed revelations. Go here to read Heartland's devastating rebuttal to an unusually stupid–even for them!–New York Times article on Gleick's document dump. Many commentators have critiqued Gleick's actions, and in particular, have addressed the question whether at least one of the documents he published–the only significant one, really–was forged by him. Megan McArdle has done an especially good job in this respect. I am not sure whether she was the first person to raise the question of Gleick's fake document, but she was certainly among the first.
Here is the document in question, in PDF format; click to enlarge. It is two pages long, dated January 2012, and is titled “Confidential Memo: 2012 Heartland Climate Strategy.” I think the document was obviously faked, presumably by Mr. Gleick, and will explain why momentarily. Meanwhile, here is Gleick's memo:
Now let's look at Gleick's memo paragraph by paragraph and consider whether it could possibly be genuine.
Given the increasingly prominent role the Heartland Institute is playing in leading the fight to prevent the implementation of dangerous policy actions to address the supposed risks of global warming, it is useful to set priorities for our efforts in 2012.
If you know anything about intra-organizational communications, the antennae are already going up. This reads like a liberal's framing device, not like a legitimate introduction to a strategy memo.
This document offers such a set of priorities. I propose that at this point it is kept confidential and only be distributed to a subset of the Institute Board and senior staff.
This, frankly, is ridiculous. Note, first, that no name is attached to the memo; it wasn't written by anyone in particular. How convenient! Further, any legitimate document of this type would be shared with the organization's board and with a wide range of staffers. Gleick's disclaimer, supposedly establishing an inner circle within Heartland, is obviously intended to anticipate the reaction of Heartland's board members and employees: they've never seen this memo before. Is that because it was top secret? No, it is because it is a fraud.
Our climate work is attractive to funders, especially our key Anonymous Donor (whose contribution dropped from $1,664,150 in 2010 to $979,000 in 2011 — about 20% of our total 2011 revenue.) He has promised an increase in 2012….
This seems geared to an audience of fellow liberals, not to a top-secret subset of Heartland's board. Gleick's document was created for the sole purpose of being “leaked.”
We will also pursue additional support from the Charles G. Koch Foundation. They returned as a Heartland donor in 2011 with a contribution of $200,000.
As Megan McArdle has pointed out, Koch's contribution was earmarked for Heartland's health care work and had nothing to do with climate change. This was obvious from other documents that Gleick stole, so Gleick's fabrication here was entirely malicious.
We expect to push up their level of support in 2012 and gain access to their network of philanthropists, if our focus continues to align with their interests.
I mean, really! The fake Gleick memo actually says this.
Other contributions will be pursued for this work, especially from corporations whose interests are threatened by climate policies.
Could it be any more obvious that this is a liberal's fantasy? Gleick didn't get the document he was hoping for, so he made it up.
Gleick's memo goes on to discuss the teaching of global warming in schools. Which, by the way, is a scandal, but not in the way the Gleick and his fellow leftists understand. What follows is the biggest howler in Gleick's fake document:
Principals and teachers are heavily biased toward the alarmist perspective. To counter this we are considering launching an effort to develop alternative materials for K-12 classrooms. We are pursuing a proposal from Dr. David Wojick to produce a global warming curriculum for K-12 schools…His effort will focus on providing curriculum that shows that the topic of climate change is controversial and uncertain–two key points that are effective at dissuading teachers from teaching science.
This is almost unbelievably stupid, and it was obviously written by a left-winger who has never read any of Heartland's sophisticated critiques of global warming hysteria. The idea that conservatives want to “dissuade teachers from teaching science” is the ultimate left-wing fantasy. On the contrary, as Heartland has explained in painstaking detail, it wants teachers to teach science at a far more knowledgeable and sophisticated level than the cartoonish global warming hysteria that is peddled by the likes of Al Gore and Peter Gleick. It is safe to say that no representative of Heartland could have written this paragraph.
At present we sponsor the NIPCC to undermine the official United Nation's IPCC reports and pid a team of writers $388,000 in 2011 to work on a series of editions of Climate Change Reconsidered. … NIPCC is currently funded by two gifts a year from two foundations, both of them requesting anonymity.
This paragraph, once again, is evidently intended as a sop to a liberal audience. It is implausible as an excerpt from an actual Heartland report. The UN's “official” IPCC reports are one of the great scandals of our time; they contradict one another in fundamental ways, and all are in conflict with scientific observations. No Heartland insider would have written this paragraph.
Our current budget includes funding for high-profile individuals who regularly and publicly counter the alarmist AGW message. At the moment, this funding goes primarily to Craig Idso ($11,600 per month), Fred Singer ($5,000 per month, plus expenses), Robert Carter ($1,667 per month) and a number of other individuals, but we will consider expanding it, if funding can be found.
As with the rest of the memo, this paragraph appears to be aimed at gullible New York Times reporters, not an inner circle of Heartland board members. Gleick now goes on to discredit–with his own liberal base, anyway–a variety of global warming realists:
Heartland plays an important role in climate communications, especially through our in-house experts (e.g., Taylor) through his Forbes blog and related high profile outlets, our conferences, and through coordination with external networks (such as WUWT and other groups capable of rapidly mobilizing responses to new scientific findings, news stories, or unfavorable blog posts).
Who could be dumb enough to fall for this? Not our readers, surely. “WUWT” is Anthony Watts's site, Watts Up With That?, one of the world's top resources for scientific news about the Earth's climate. This paragraph, like others in Gleick's liberal fantasy, hypothesizes a cosmic coordination among realist web sources and news outlets. Liberals can't account for how the truth keeps beating them over the head, except by positing a conspiracy of skeptics.
Efforts at places such as Forbes are especially important now that they have begun to allow high-profile climate scientists (such as Gleick) to post the warmest science essays that counter our own.
This is hilarious, actually. With all due respect to Forbes's online team of bloggers, they are not exactly the front line of the climate debate–but for the fact that Gleick, the apparent author of the fake memo, has a foothold there. And Gleick, contrary to his own self-description, is not a “climate scientist,” high-profile or otherwise. The forger always flatters his own vanity!
This influential audience has usually been reliably anti-climate and it is important to keep opposing voices out.
This is the moment where Gleick jumped the shark, if we can still say that. Those who are skeptical of the Left's global warming hoax are not “anti-climate,” and the idea that an internal Heartland memo would describe them as such is ludicrous. Nor does anyone on the logical side of the climate debate have any intention of “keep[ing] opposing voices out.” On the contrary, all we want is for the voices of sanity and science to be heard.
One could go on, but that is more than enough. Let me be perfectly clear: I think it is obvious that Peter Gleick fabricated this document–the only one he posted that makes the Heartland Institute look bad–because the real ones he stole from Heartland didn't serve his partisan purpose. Or, if he didn't make it up himself, he got it from an ally who fabricated it. No knowledgeable person could mistake Gleick's hoax for a legitimate top-secret Heartland memo.
So, Peter Gleick: if I am wrong, sue me. If I am right, apologize for fabricating a document and attempting to perpetrate a hoax, and retire from public life.
And let me just add this warning: litigation is a two-way street. If you sue me, I get to take your deposition under oath. If you lie again, you can go to jail. I get to subpoena your telephone records and find out exactly whom you have been talking with, when and for how long. I get to examine the hard drives of your computers and reconstruct every email you have ever sent or received, especially those that you have deleted. I get to depose third party witnesses under oath. If someone other than you faked the Heartland memo, I can get his testimony, under penalty of perjury. I can trace the development of every Word document you have ever had a hand in creating, and I can identify the precise moment when you converted it to PDF and posted it on the internet in hopes of embarrassing Heartland. So, Peter Gleick: if you are afraid to sue me, then admit that you are a liar and a hoaxer and slink away in shame.
Forsyth County deputies were still piecing together Monday evening what happened during a shootout in which a woman was wounded after she said she confronted two burglars in her house.
The Cumming woman was rushed to a Gainesville hospital Monday morning with three bullet wounds, including one to her stomach, Deputy Doug Rainwater said. She was also wounded in an arm and a leg.
Investigators took samples of blood splatters in the house to determine if an intruder was also shot, he said. Investigators believe the two suspected burglars were a man and a woman, Rainwater said.
“We are trying to determine what happened in the gunfight and whether all the blood is hers,” Rainwater said. “She was shot three times, but she returned fire with her own gun. She fired several shots, but we don't know if one of them was hit.”
Deputies haven't released the name or age of the woman but said she was in the house alone before the shooting at Pilgrim Mill Road and Magnolia Avenue.
The gunfight happened around 10:30 a.m. when the then-sleeping woman said she heard noise, armed herself and went to investigate, Rainwater said.
“Most burglars don't carry guns to their crimes, so this is very unusual,” he said.“They probably knocked on the door to see if somebody was home and she is sound asleep. Next thing she knows she hears all the noise in the house and she gets up to to investigate and she is confronted.”
Rainwater did not have the woman's medical condition. She was coherent and talking to paramedics after the shooting, but Rainwater suspected she was still in serious condition because of the stomach wound.
She was operated on Monday afternoon, he said.
MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. – George Mason scored the winning run in the top of the 13th inning to defeat Wichita State 5-4 at the Baseball at the Beach tournament.
Casey Gillaspie went 3-for-5 with an RBI for the Shockers, while Garrett Bayliff had two RBI.
Drew Palmer threw four shutout innings, while Reagan Biechler threw five shutout innings. Reliever TJ Looney took the loss.
George Mason took an early lead with two runs in the top of the first. After Shocker starter Garrett Brummett retired the first two hitters, Luke Willis walke, Tucker Tobin singled to centerfield and Blaise Fernandez singled to left field to score Willis for the 1-0 lead. Anthony Montefusco then singled through the left side to score Tobin and give the Patriots a 2-0 lead.
The Shockers answered in the bottom of the first. Daniel Kihle reached on an error and after a groundout moved him to second, Casey Gillaspie doubled to left-center to score Kihle and cut the lead to 2-1. With two outs, Gillaspie scored on a single to left field from Tyler Baker to tie the game at two.
The Patriots responded with two more runs in the second. A base loaded hit by pitch brought the first run in and a sacrifice fly from Tobin gave George Mason a 4-2 lead.
Gillaspie led off the third with a triple down the right field line and scored on a ground out from Garrett Bayliff to cut the lead to 4-3.
Mikel Mucha reached on a fielding error with one out in the seventh and moved to second on a single from Gillaspie. Bayliff singled down the left field line to drive in Mucha and tie the score at four.
The Patriots finally broke the tie with a run in the top of the 13th. An infield single from Luke Willis scored Brandon Gum to give George Mason a 5-4 lead.
The Shockers are next in action at 1 p.m. (Central) on Sun., Feb. 23 against Coastal Carolina.

Few public policy issues are as fraught with competing interests and short fuses as that of elderly drivers. The ability to drive is an important part of independence for most seniors and the loss of a driver's licence can be a devastating blow. On the other hand, we want to keep our roads as safe as possible; everyone, it seems, has a story to tell about an aged relative prone to “senior moments” at the wheel. To ensure all elderly drivers are fit for the road, many provinces now impose specific tests or medical requirements on seniors renewing their licences.
However, Ruth Adria, spokesperson for the Elder Advocates of Alberta Society, argues current licensing procedures in her province have become “an injustice.” Earlier this month, her group organized a seniors' protest outside a Red Deer hospital to bring attention to the issue.
Currently, Albertans aged 75 must pass a medical exam to renew their licences. As a component of this, doctors may additionally request that patients complete two cognitive-ability tests. The first, performed in a doctor's office, requires patients to answer a variety of fast-paced questions, such as naming 30 things you can buy in a grocery store. If the driver fails that, a computer-based exam called DriveABLE may be required, at an out-of-pocket cost of $250. Both tests are widely used in other provinces as well.
“These tests appear to have little connection with the ability to drive,” complains Adria. As evidence, she musters scores of examples of elderly drivers who failed both exams but later passed a road test on appeal. She bolsters her case by repeatedly citing provincial accident data showing drivers aged 65 and over to have the lowest casualty collision rate among all age groups. Adria argues a physical exam alone ought to be sufficient to spot seniors who should no longer be driving. Besides, she adds, most seniors self-regulate—avoiding trips at night or during high-traffic times.
“These tests are a form of elder abuse,” she charges, “and the worst kind, because losing your licence can be incredibly stressful and damaging to a senior.”
And yet, regardless of Adria's objections, the prospect of some type of standardized test to determine which seniors should and shouldn't be driving seems likely across Canada in the not-too-distant future, if only because doctors want it.
In most provinces, physicians have a legal duty to report any patient they believe is unfit to drive. But the typical general practitioner lacks specific training to make this difficult decision. Further, “forcing physicians to take away a licence can really poison the doctor-patient relationship,” warns Dr. Michel Bédard, Canada Research Chair in Aging and Health at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ont. For these reasons, a consistent, arm's-length procedure to determine fitness to drive is attractive to many doctors.
That said, Bédard finds common ground with Adria in observing current tests may be neither appropriate nor accurate. “Anything that involves computers has the potential to confuse seniors,” he observes. And listing grocery-store items has little to do with road safety. Some tests may specifically disadvantage seniors with limited education.
To better assess elderly drivers, Bédard is a co-investigator with the Canadian Driving Research Initiative for Vehicular Safety in the Elderly (Candrive), a federally funded research project based at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute that's tracking almost 1,000 seniors over four years to measure their cognitive and driving abilities. Candrive's goal is to unveil a simple, scientifically valid (and non-computerized) screening procedure within the next two or three years that could eventually be adopted Canada-wide. “Having a national standard for elderly drivers would make a lot of sense,” adds Bédard. Other countries are struggling with the same issue.
As for her assertion that seniors are the safest drivers on the road, Adria is simply wrong. Older drivers appear safer on statistical charts only because they drive much less than everyone else. “Once you correct for mileage driven, the crash risk for elderly drivers is almost as high as that of novice teen drivers,” says Mary Kelly, professor of insurance at the School of Business and Economics at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ont. Kelly was recently an expert witness at an Ontario Human Rights tribunal hearing that ruled higher insurance premiums for older drivers are not a form of discrimination, but rather a valid response to elevated crash rates.
“The main difference between older and younger drivers is that young drivers are high risk because of their inexperience and risk-taking behaviour,” says Kelly. “But they improve over time. Older drivers don't.”
I awoke this morning from a stimulating dream about Yes and progressive music. It was an unusual dream in that I visualized listening to a Yes recording with much of the dream focused on a woodcut edition of Roger Dean album art. I think this was all due to looking at Yes hi-res recordings on the Pono Music Store before I went to bed last night 😉
I sat down with my breakfast this morning and searched the Pono Music Store once again. My searches focused on the Yes Relayer recording in 192/24 resolution format. I'm confident the cover art in my dreams was Relayer. I must confess I know very little about that recording nor I have ever listened to it. I toyed with the idea of purchasing and downloading the Pono edition of the recording when I saw a side note inquiring if this recording was the recent Steven Wilson remix. I learned from the Official Yes Website that the Steven Wilson edition contained far more content in the Blu-Ray/CD edition and was 96/24 hi-res.
Steven Wilson has been the point person since 2009 remixing the Four Horsemen of Progressive Rock King Crimson, Jethro Tull, ELP, and Yes. His precision engineering and keen ear has increased the listening experience of many classic recordings.
Steven Wilson's 2015 focus will be to support his next recording, Hand. Cannot. Erase. which becomes available March 3rd, 2015. I am considering the Blu-Ray Hi-Res release.
Steven Wilson placed reasonably priced tickets on sale for the USA/Canada leg of Tour 2015. I'd love to see him perform. It could be a dream come true 😉

1. According to Arthur C. Clarke, Stanley Kubrick wanted to get an insurance policy from Lloyd's of London to protect himself against losses in the event that extraterrestrial intelligence were discovered before the movie was released. Lloyd's refused.
2.The total footage shot was some 200 times the final length of the film.
3. Stanley Kubrick had several tons of sand imported, washed, and painted for the moon surface scenes.
4. The carry-on bags belonging to Russian space scientists with whom Dr. Floyd shares a drink are marked Aeroflot (in Cyrillic), still today the Russian national airline.
5. A working title was “Voyage Beyond the Stars”. When Fantastic Voyage was released, Stanley Kubrick reportedly so disliked that film that he did not want his film to sound anything like it. In the end, “2001” was chosen as it is the first year of both the 21st century and the 3rd millennium.
6. There is no dialogue in the first 25 minutes of the movie (ending when a stewardess speaks at 25:38), nor in the last 23 minutes (excluding end credits). With these two lengthy sections and other shorter ones, there are around 88 dialogue-free minutes in the movie.
7. Rock band Pink Floyd was at one point approached to perform music for the film. However they turned it down due to other commitments.
8. The main Discovery set was built by aircraft manufacturer Vickers-Armstrong inside a 12-meter by two-meter drum designed to rotate at five km per hour. It cost $750,000.
9. Frank Poole and Dave Bowman watch themselves in a television interview on “BBC 12”. This was a play on the fact that, at the time of production, there were only BBC channels 1 and 2. The presenter in this scene is Kenneth Kendall, the first newsreader seen on British TV in 1955.
10. Originally, Stanley Kubrick had Stuart Freeborn create a primitive but more human-like makeup for the actors playing early man, but he couldn't find a way to photograph them in full length without getting an X-rating from the MPAA, since they had to be naked. So Kubrick went with the hairy monkey model instead. With the exception of two baby chimpanzees, all were played by humans in costume.
11. The entire film contains only 205 special effects shots, compared to 350 in Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope and over 2,200 such shots in Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith.
12. The last movie made about men on the moon before Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked there in real life. 40 years later, conspiracy theorists insist that this is not a coincidence, claiming that all footage of Armstrong's voyage was a hoax film directed by Stanley Kubrick using leftover scenes and props from this movie.
13. HAL 9000 never once says, “Good Morning, Dave,” despite this line being one of his most recognized quotations.
14. Aside from the film's music, no sound is heard in the space sequences. This is because technically in space, there is no sound.
15. Originally, HAL was to be called Athena and have a female voice.
16. In the premier screening of the film, 241 people walked out of the theater, including Rock Hudson who said “Will someone tell me what the hell this is about?” Arthur C. Clarke once said, “If you understand ‘2001' completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered.”
17. The movie was not a financial success during the first weeks of its theatrical run. MGM was already planning to pull it back from theaters, when they were persuaded by several theatre owners to keep showing the film. Many theater owners had observed increasing numbers of young adults attending the film, who were especially enthusiastic about watching the ‘Star Gate' sequence under the influence of psychotropic drugs. This helped the film to become a financial success in the end, despite the many negative reactions it received in the beginning.

The U.S. military campaign against self-proclaimed Islamic State may be focused on the male fighters conducting attacks across Iraq and Syria. But the richest human intelligence source to fall into U.S. hands to date is the widow of a senior ISIS member. She is revealing details about the terror group's inner workings—including the existence of a parallel women's network within ISIS that's responsible for recruitment, retention, intelligence, and sexual slavery in the so-called caliphate.
U.S. military personnel captured Umm Sayyaf during a May raid targeting her husband, who was also ISIS's chief financier who went by the nom de guerre Abu Sayyaf. After engaging in “hand to hand” combat with ISIS fighters, U.S. troops killed Abu Sayyaf and took his computers, cellphones, and documents that detailed how the group obtained and distributed as much as $2 million a day.
Umm Sayyaf is now the top female ISIS captive in U.S. custody, being held in Iraq and providing loads of intelligence beyond what American analysts found on the computers and cellphones seized during the raid that killed her husband, who ran ISIS's oil and gas operations. Umm Sayyaf's marriage to an ISIS higher-up gave her rare insights into how men run the financial and tactical operations. But she also played a commanding role in her own right, helping to run ISIS's networks of women fighters and operatives, as well as playing enforcer for the men's sex slaves, four defense officials told The Daily Beast.
“She was a principal adviser,” a senior defense official explained. “She has a lot of details."
There is a hierarchy within ISIS among women. A woman's rank tracks with her husband's. The higher in the ISIS org chart, the more she would know about the terror group's operations. Umm Sayyaf is among an elite class of women within ISIS's male-dominated hierarchy.
“Behind every successful man is a woman, and ISIS is no exception,” said a senior administration official who is closely following the interrogation of Umm Sayyaf.
But that doesn't mean Sayyaf was part of the ISIS's military chain of command, nor that she was helping design ISIS's plan to take and hold territory, the official said.
“Was she influential? Yes. Did she have a commanding role? No,” the official said Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. “She was not calling the shots on the direction of the ISIS enterprise,” though she was helping run the women's network within ISIS, according to her and according to the documents retrieved by U.S. special operations from the site.
She's not the first female to provide insights into ISIS. There have been several women who have publicly defected from ISIS. Some of them have told the U.S. how they were recruited, how they traveled from their home countries to join ISIS, and about the persistent campaign from men and women alike to commit to the cause. A few of these women have even explained how ISIS funded their travel and how they were able to dodge questions from concerned family about where they'd run off to.
But those accounts came almost exclusively from women lower in the ISIS hierarchy.
Sayyaf had a view from top to bottom, defense officials said. She has also provided details such as names of operatives and means of communication, two defense officials said.
“Umm Sayyaf is an anomaly,” said Mia Bloom, professor of communication at Georgia State University who studies the role of women in jihadi movements, in that Sayyaf served the traditional roles of a wife but also had visibility on ISIS's command and control.
On the lower rungs of ISIS, women are tasked primarily with serving the sexual needs of ISIS's male members, maintaining a home and producing future ISIS fighters, U.S. officials and counterterrorism experts said. In addition, in the territories that ISIS controls, there are women who work for the religious police, or Al-Khanssaa Brigade, ensuring other women are abiding by ISIS's strict religious and social standards. Often they are Arab women who can tell others when they are not abiding by the rules. There are female spies there to make sure other women stay in line. And still others facilitate a sex slave trade, assessing other women or arranging temporary marriages for them.
U.S. forces detained Sayyaf, hoping she would have insights on ISIS treatment of hostages. Some suspected that she might know details about the kidnapping of American aid worker Kayla Mueller, who died while in ISIS's custody.
What Sayyaf has said about Mueller and other hostages remains unclear. But U.S. defense officials said she has pulled back the curtain on ISIS's operations, giving details about the organization and the men who run it in ways that could not have been understood through ISIS's public statements or its aggressive Twitter propaganda campaign. And she is explaining ISIS's dependency on women to keep and retain fighters and run the state.
Perhaps the person most like Sayyaf was ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi's ex-wife, who was reportedly detained by Lebanese officials late last year.
The interrogation of Sayyaf is also contributing the role women play in recruiting men to ISIS. Often it is the promise of a bride who will care for men as they fight in the frontlines that attracts fighters to the caliphate. (One recently arrested American ISIS recruit was told he could have “four wives,” according to the FBI.) Men who seek to live in strict jihadist interpretation of Islam also enjoy the promise of a wife whose life will mainly be at home.
Under ISIS, women's primary role is to serve the needs of men, to keep the men fighting and residing in the caliphate. Upon arriving to ISIS, they are sent to a hostel, assessed by other women to determine their value, according to a report by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, and then quickly married off, sometimes at ISIS's marriage bureaus, in places like Raqqa, Syria, the group's de facto capital.
“The roles women tend to have been primarily within the family—recruit, reward, and retain,” Bloom said.
But many women join ISIS in the hopes of becoming fighters themselves. That they don't get a chance is a regression of sorts for women in jihadist movements, experts said. ISIS's predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq, deployed women as suicide bombers. Some terrorist offshoots like al Shabab, which is based in Somalia and is loyal to al Qaeda, and Nigeria's Boko Haram, which has aligned with ISIS, also have used women as suicide bombers.
“We have yet to see [in ISIS] female commanders or suicide bombers,” said Bloom. “But because there is a precedent, they will always have that option.”
A defense official knowledgeable of U.S.-led coalition operations said he was not aware of any strike explicitly targeting women.
There are no official numbers of women with ISIS. But there are roughly 500 women on Twitter who claim to be residents of ISIS, and they are often the faces of ISIS's propaganda war, telling other women they should join the caliphate. Experts assume that the ratio of men to women within ISIS is 10 to 1. With estimates of ISIS's strength beginning at 20,000 fighters, that would mean at least 2,000 women are part of the self-proclaimed Caliphate.
Whatever the ratio, Umm Sayyaf has been so valuable that U.S. interrogators are learning more weeks into her questioning and have yet to decide what should happen to her next, two defense officials said. The interrogators have not yet determined if Abu Sayyaf is guilty of any crimes that are prosecutable in a U.S. court of law, in which case the U.S. would seek to extradite her from Iraq, the administration official said. If there's not enough evidence to try her in the States, she may be handed to Iraqi custody. What happens to Umm Sayyaf then is unknown.

The summer of 1957 would seem to mark the redemption of Thelonious Monk, the summer he made Monk's Music in one night.
He was then a 39-year-old New York jazz pianist of great repute who hadn't been able to work at most jazz clubs in New York for the past six years. His cabaret card, a relic of New York law enforcement since prohibition, had been revoked in 1951 after a spurious narcotics charge. And so he hadn't been easy to see, which means he might have seemed elusive. He was introverted and sometimes guarded; such behavior has never been unusual in jazz. In fact he lived with bipolar disorder—undiagnosed at the time, though we know about it now, especially through the work of the scholar Robin D.G. Kelley, whose book Thelonious Monk: The Life and Times of an American Original is the principal source of much biographical information here.
At the end of 1955, Monk's mother, Barbara, had died. In early 1956, an electrical fire destroyed his New York apartment on West 63rd Street, totaling his piano and resulting in his family of five, basically destitute, having to stay for months with friends—15 people in a three-room apartment. At the beginning of 1957, Monk spent three weeks in Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital, taken there by a policeman he'd been unresponsive to after a car accident. (What else was going on in his bloodline? Kelley's book, at this period, contains a chilling sentence: “Thelonious did not know that his own father had been living in a mental asylum for the past fifteen years.”) In May, his wife Nellie developed an illness which resulted in a thyroidectomy, leaving her frail and depressed, which had a relay effect on Monk. Also during this time, Monk got himself a manager, began a close musical relationship with John Coltrane, made several albums for Riverside records including Monk's Music, regained his cabaret card, and started a six-month job at the Five Spot Café—a gig which would re-establish his performing career, serve as Coltrane's finishing school, and be described thereafter as a high point in New York jazz culture.
This is all a relatively easy story to tell. There is a reversal of fortune; Monk makes a great album; he wins. Like any cliche, it only applies badly to Monk.
As a pianist, Monk, who would have turned 100 this year, was not a dazzler-virtuoso like Art Tatum or Oscar Peterson. He phrased in a wide circumference around the beat, leaving a lot of silence in an improvisation, enough for you to notice. He made polytonal clonks on the keyboard by playing the desired note as well as the key adjacent to it. The assumption, often, was that either he didn't have much technique, or was withholding it because he didn't want to be understood or known too quickly, and why would someone do that?
A common initial reaction to Monk was skepticism. The pianist Randy Weston, then 18, first saw Monk playing in Coleman Hawkins' band. “Who is this cat on piano?” Weston remembers thinking, in his memoir African Rhythms. “I can play more piano than this guy!” In other words: it's unclear what this person knows. Another reaction was humility. The drummer Art Blakey described in a 1973 interview how Monk had been his sympathetic guide through what Blakey called the “cliques” in New York jazz when Blakey first arrived from Pittsburgh in the early '40s. Blakey watched Monk defend his own music and insist on the right way to play it. “He was very outspoken,” he said. “He knew what he wanted to do, and he did it.” In other words: this person knows a lot.
Much of the talk around jazz, and around Monk, turns on ideas of knowing and not-knowing. (I keep the hyphen, as for related reasons did Donald Barthelme in his essay of that name as well as various Buddhists and psychotherapists, because by “not-knowing” I mean flexibility, working without a fixed outcome, trusting oneself to find a new vocabulary, as opposed to what I would mean without the hyphen: ignorance, lack of awareness, incuriosity.) By one understanding, jazz is a consensual language of rhythm, harmony, and form, and a consensual repertoire accumulated over the last hundred years. That's about knowing. If you want to work in jazz, you have to get the basic songs under your fingers. Those songs—including, say, “All the Things You Are,” “Donna Lee,” “Footprints,” and about ten by Thelonious Monk—are a part of what holds the tradition together.
The larger part is the fact that jazz is essentially African-American in musical vocabulary and disposition. Jazz is cultural memory. For many African-American musicians, to know is also to be aware of the values and dangers; to know is not to forget. Monk's music suggested the cumulative past as a wider present: something older from within jazz—boogie-woogie or early Ellington—along with other vernacular traditions adjacent to it: rumba, gospel, or rhythm and blues.
Jazz is further defined by the discipline of improvising, which some say is an express-lane to thinking through time progressively and allowing possibility, the greater idea of not-knowing.
From the first seconds of “Well, You Needn't,” the second track on Monk's Music and the record's greatest eleven minutes, much control is in evidence. You hear Monk, with only the bassist Wilbur Ware thrumming in the back, working upward from the C below middle C over an F pedal in half-steps: C, Db, D, Eb, E. Monk is playing in an implied three-beat rhythm, and punching out his notes a little roughly, as you might imagine yourself punching an elevator button. But he is doing it in between the beats, with style and purpose. He climbs his five notes twice, each time bringing you one step away from resolution in a perfect cadence; he is building tension and expectation in a classical and idiomatic way, alerting you that something is going to take place here, and it's going to be an event. Then it arrives: the song's hard opening, with John Coltrane, Coleman Hawkins and the rest of the septet piling in, Art Blakey's drumming shoving it forward.
The band plays the theme together and Blakey crashes on its last beat. Now it's Monk's turn. He doesn't start until the cymbal quiets down, and so for the first measure and a half there is silence. His solo begins as a restatement of the song's melody, according to convention, but picks it up like a sentence started in the middle. He speeds up and slows down, experimenting, stamping his foot a little, testing the strength of the rhythm and his own relationship to it. Three times he brings his hand down on a strange five-note chord: a stack of fourths, all black notes. Each time he lets it ring for six beats. “Well, You Needn't” was not a particularly famous song in 1957—Monk had recorded it ten years before for Blue Note, also with Blakey—but it sounds colossal here.
Monk wasn't an album artist per se. Monk's Music—produced by Orrin Keepnews, recorded at Reeves Sound Studios on East 44th Street, released on Riverside Records—is contradictory: strident, reassuring, fractured, centered. It isn't perfect, whatever perfect means. Here and there it sounds like a rehearsal or a jam session. Some solos wander, particularly on “Epistrophy,” and the trumpeter Ray Copeland and alto saxophonist Gigi Gryce are comparatively weak links. But Monk's Music also sounds loose and deep and urgent. At its best it suggests a party in a specific room; you come to know the room. After Monk finishes his solo in “Well, You Needn't,” he shouts “Coltrane! Coltrane!” to signal who's up next. Ravi Coltrane, John's son, told me that when he first heard Monk's Music he was 21, listening in a university library with headphones on. At Monk's shout, he startled, thinking someone was looking for him.
The band includes the saxophonist John Coltrane, Monk's new student, who sounds dry, driven, searching; the saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, Monk's old mentor, with a gallant and knowing affect that he puts to special use on Monk's ballad “Ruby, My Dear”; and Blakey, a kind of younger brother, pro-active, explosive, rendering the dance impulse in super-titles. Monk himself does nothing strange by his own standards. He is brusque and vatic and intimate, moving through funny, orderly, supremely affective songs. The first track is the exception in several ways: it is only a melody, played in straight rhythm by the horns alone; it is a hymn called “Abide With Me,” also known as “Eventide,” composed in the middle of the 19th century by the English composer William Henry Monk. Destiny's Child liked to put their gospel songs at the end of their records; Monk put his at the beginning.
Monk's Music includes the first renderings of a harmonically rich song that would become one of Monk's standards, “Crepuscule With Nellie,” written for his wife at a fragile time. Monk plays it unnervingly slowly, and bids the band to do the same with him. (One of his drummers at the time, Frankie Dunlop, in an interview from 1984 extraordinary for the secret knowledge about rhythm it reveals, as well as for Dunlop's imitation of Monk's speaking voice, called Monk's approach to tempo “a different musical category altogether.”) Really, it's a radical slow dance. During the Five Spot gig, while others soloed, Monk began the practice of dancing on stage: a soft lurch, turning in a circle, imitating the greater circle around the beat.
A lot came together for Monk in 1957. Shortly thereafter, starting in the 1960s, he shifted up to touring theaters with a steady band. His records became elegantly repetitive and often staid. He appeared on the cover of Time magazine in 1964; from then on, till his withdrawal from playing in the 1970s and his death in 1982, he was “known.”
You can make fun of jazz writers from the distant past all day, but some of their early published ideas about Monk in the '40s, especially in Down Beat and Metronome, were only as naïve as Weston's. If they liked him, they were describing a European-style avant-garde hero, desiring to cut loose from the known. If they didn't like him, they were describing music they found incomplete or antisocial. They described him as “too too,” “for the super hip alone,” “neurotic,” and—worst of all—“bad, though interesting.” All these reactions imply Monk's fecklessness or lack of control. They are the reactions of people encountering a critical intelligence and not knowing what to do with it.
Monk's story is a story of relationships. Born in Rocky Mount, NC, he grew up among Southern and Antillean families at 234 West 63rd Street in Manhattan, on a block now called Thelonious Monk Circle. A couple doors down, No. 224, was the Columbus Hill Neighborhood Center, his social hub and the site of his early gigs. His engagement in the jazz culture of Harlem through the '40s, alongside Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell, and Kenny Clarke, created several new languages in jazz, collectively and roughly described as bebop. All his interviews, all the anecdotes, illustrate that Monk, to a great degree, knew his own value and had no interest in being strange on purpose. (“I don't like the word ‘weird,' anyway,” he told Nat Hentoff.) He knew who he was, and that knowledge allowed him the freedom of not-knowing.
One of the best lines in Kelley's book comes in a secondhand story told by the poet Ted Joans. Be skeptical, but here it is. At some point in the second half of 1957, during a set at the Five Spot, Monk wandered off stage as the band continued to play, out the doors of the club, and walked for a few blocks. One of the club owners chased him down and found him looking at the sky. He asked Monk if he was lost. “No, I ain't lost. I'm here,” Monk is said to have responded. “The Five Spot's lost.”
A new-to-me company, Ten Three Labs, recently began doing a limited-release box called Phantasmagoria, each “Projection” of which centers on a haunted town, and features a selection of eye shadows, lip products, and perfume. I was THRILLED when I found out that Ellicott City, MD would be Projection Two. Ellicott City is one of my favorite places on earth. It's a special date night spot for my husband and I– if you're relatively local, you should definitely stop at Pure Wine Cafe for their truffle fries and their chocolate pot de crème. And the Bean Hollow is hands-down my very favorite coffee shop in all the land. Plus, we are lovers of haunted history, and whoa can you feel it in Ellicott City! So when I snagged a spot on the Projection Two list, I did a happy dance.
My box arrived on Saturday. I picked up the mail on the way out of the door, and like the impatient lady I am, opened it in the car. And promptly lost my list of what was what. Oops. Well done, self. Luckily, Indiedulge posted shots of her box, including the list, so I'm gonna crib off of her for the descriptions!
Without further ado:
The shadows: the left swatch is over Too Faced Shadow Insurance, the right over Fyrinnae Pixie Epoxy.
7 Hills: Ellicott City sits in front of a series of hills. The legend goes that if you hit the seventh hill at exactly midnight, you'll be chased by a demon car that mysteriously appears out of thin air. Pro-tip, don't do this!
Deep Grey with red sparks. Lip safe!
7 Hills is a deep charcoal grey with lovely pinkish red micro-sparkles. This color isn't particularly for me– greys tend to make me look bruised. But it is really pretty!
Hayden: Also known as Oak Lawn, Hayden House was built in the 19th century by the town's first county clerk, Edwin Parson Hayden. After Hayden's death in 1850, the home went through several different owners and usages, and racked up its fair share of ghost stories along the way. Among the more famous happenings around Hayden House are spooky footsteps, coffee being heated even when the pot is unplugged, a ghostly cook making the home smell like various breakfast foods, and a mysterious hazy white mist floating around.
Muted raspberry with lavender sparks. Lip safe!
I'd say this is a raspberry over a brick shade, with a purplish cast which gets stronger over a sticky base. It's SUUUUPER pretty.
Forget-Me-Not Factory: A former opera house, the Forget-Me-Not factory is full of history, and is one of the known haunted places in Ellicott City. The fourth floor of the building, where access is prohibited, is thought to be haunted by John Wilkes Booth, who made his acting career debut in that very building. Though there are very few sightings today, many tell stories of hearing strange noises, seeing orbs captured on camera, and even seeing a piano playing by itself. In fact, the piano kept playing by itself so much that the owners ended up buying a coin-operated, self-playing piano to play homage to this ghost when they got rid of the original one.
Light purple with a beautiful turquoise shift. NOT lip safe!
Though my camera ENTIRELY refused to capture it, there is indeed a beautiful pale turquoise shift in this shadow. I look forward to seeing how it stands up to similar shades in my collection, Femme Fatale's Faerie Fire and Notoriously Morbid's Glorious Honor. All fairy themed, which is funny because the Forget-Me-Not factory is ALSO fairy themed! Well, at least the first two floors are. The third floor has this whackadoo Halloween / Christmas / Dress-up Closet mashup dealie going on. I both love this store AND am creeped out by it, especially when I stop in on quiet days. You just feel watched in there, I don't know how else to explain it. If someone told me that there was a portal to some slightly-sinister magical land somewhere in that building, I would 100% believe it.
And yet, it's NOT the store in Ellicott City where I actually saw a ghost.
Lip Products:
Saucebox Sheen- Heart Beat Bridge: Probably the creepiest ghost story in the town, the legend of Heart Beat Bridge say that the bridge is haunted by a woman who was brutally murdered by her lover. The man cut out her heart and threw it into the stream. If you listen carefully enough, you can hear her heart beating from beneath the bridge. Or so they say.
Bloody raspberry with blue sheen.
Swatched on a day where it TOTALLY didn't match my eye makeup. Welp.
So, while I can totally see the sheen in the tube, it disappears on the lips. But still, this color is gorgeous! I wouldn't call it raspberry– much like the Hayden shadow, it has sort of a brick-ish base with a berry tint. It's very Autumnal, and I love it!
Salve Stick – Ghost Chef: Inspired by the mischievous ghosts within Hayden House.
Mocha latte.
This has a really nice chocolatey coffee smell. Very yummy. I'd say the texture is not super thick, but nicely moisturizing.
Perfume:
Lilburn: Built in 1957 by Henry Richard Hazelhurst, Lilburn Manor may well be one of the most haunted places in Ellicott City. The home has seen its fair share of tragedies, including a fire that destroyed the original home. After replacing the gothic spires on the home with stone, the weird happenings around the home increased. Reports of chandeliers swinging back and forth, phantom footsteps, overturned vases, a child crying, and cigar smoke are all part of Lilburn's haunted history. At least two physical apparitions have also been seen in the home.
Notes: wafts of cigar smoke, smoldering rubble, petitgrain, bergamot, frankincense absolute.
Based on the notes, I expected to hate this. It is AWESOME, though. My husband even huffed my wrists. It smells like pipe smoke, not cigar smoke. Sweet– like cherry tobacco, but only a hint of cherry. I get a little bit of bergamot, but this is almost all cozy, Autumnal pipe smoke. And maybe a touch of coffee? It reminds me a little of BPAL's long-gone LE, Herr Drosselmeyer, and has the same feel as Hoggle. Oh man, this is going to get so much use when the weather turns chilly!
Overall, the only product in this box I won't use is 7 Hills, but even then I can say it's a very pretty shade. For my intro to this brand, I'd say it's a pretty big success! (And what does it say about Ellicott City that there are so many haunted spots that she didn't even get to touch on The Patapsco Female Institute or Mount Ida?!)
Anyway, the IndieMakeupAndMore locals are hoping to have a meet-up in Ellicott City in early August and go on a walking ghost tour. If you might want to come, drop the organizer a line!

While Hillary Clinton acknowledges that the Second Amendment is a Constitutional right, she argues that there are still just “too many guns in our homes” and we've got to do something about it. And by “doing something about it”, she means strip way the second amendment by conveniently blaming the gun and not the individual.
The Democratic presidential front-runner suggested on a campaign stop in Philadelphia on Wednesday that the gun lobby is way to large and this needs to be a voting issue. She argued that the nation has “got to do more to save more lives”. But the “lives” we are talking about are not the majority of deaths recorded by the CDC, which shows that 192,945 die annually from poisoning. Clinton cherry picks the 33,000 people who have been “killed by guns”, she says, regardless of the equivalent amount of people who have died in one year as a result of motor vehicle accidents and six times more, 192, 945, who have died as a result of an injury. Interestingly, she doesn't mention anything about the enormous Pharmaceutical or Automobile industry lobby that immeasurably benefited financially from government legislation.
The facts according the CDC are that 33,804 people have been killed in incidents relating to vehicles, but we don't advocate for fewer cars to be driven on our roads. We know that many of those deaths may be attributed to DUIs, but we never advocate for outlawing alcohol. Generally, we see a call for harsher punishment for the violators. The U.S. had raised the drinking age to 21 decades ago, yet this has done little to waver the will of the weak-minded to break the law or prevent one from making poor decisions and get into a two-ton vehicle while intoxicated.
It's important to point out these facts because the left continues to pander to the bleeding heart individual on the false diatribe that guns are what need to be limited and that would stop the shootings, regardless of the consequences it may result in preventing a law-abiding citizen from protecting themselves from those who will find ways around their laws. Needless to say, this misguided belief also detracts the responsibility of the person who committed the action.
Clinton's criticism of the strength of the gun lobby may be a valid contention, after all there are a lot of powerful interests in Washington, but lets not leave out some of the largest ones: The various Farm Lobbies, Pharmaceuticals, and the Automobile lobby in Washington. They are all making decisions that are not necessarily in the best interest of the american people, but they are nonetheless, a clear and evident power in legislation.
However, there is one distinction. There is no compromising on the Constitutional right to defend oneself and that is something the Clintons have perhaps taken for granted, due to their entitlement to armed secret service and trained personal security detail. Most of us women aren't entitled to that same privilege, that you are, Mrs. Clinton, and as a woman, you should know better. Perhaps your privileged status has desensitized you from this reality?

Sudan President al-Bashir wanted by ICC avoids arrest in South Africa - report

12:05 16/06/2015
MOSCOW, June 16 (RAPSI) – South African authorities have failed to arrest Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir during his visit to the country despite the warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC), BBC reported on Tuesday.
President of Sudan visited South African Johannesburg in order to participate in African Union (AU) summit.
President's aircraft has left the country several hours before The Pretoria High Court has issued an order for his arrest, BBC reported.
In March 2009 the Hague court issued an arrest warrant for a group of Sudanese officials, including President Omar al-Bashir, on charges of genocide and military crimes.
Hostilities between the government army and numerous rebel groups, which demanded a change of regime in Darfur, western Sudan, started in 2003. According to the United Nation (UN) statistics, about 300,000 people have died in the conflict since then.
The public response, at least on the Internet, has tended toward outrage, with many postings expressing sympathy for the women. “Why aren't corrupt officials dragged through the streets?” read one posting. “These women are only trying to feed themselves.”
But much of the anger has been directed at the police, who are a focus of growing public mistrust. Although corruption among the police is rife in China , the disdain has been further heightened by a series of widely publicized episodes involving the torture of detainees, suspects who mysteriously died in custody and innocent people jailed on trumped-up evidence.

One man spent 10 years in prison for murder after the police extracted his confession — only to be freed when his supposed victim turned out to be alive.
Mao Shoulong, a professor of public policy at People's University in Beijing , said the new regulations were necessary to rein in the worst impulses of the police.
“There are more modern tools for law enforcement,” he said. “Besides, if these kinds of tactics are allowed, the police will get used to dealing with problems outside of the law.”

The most recent wave of prostitution arrests involving thousands of suspects is part of a seven-month “strike hard” campaign aimed at gambling , drug use and violent crime. As part of the increased law enforcement efforts, judicial authorities have been encouraged to mete out swifter, and harsher, punishment. It is the fourth such campaign since 1983.
Public shaming of the accused and the condemned has been a long tradition in China — one that the Communist Party embraced with zeal during episodes of class struggle and anticrime crusades. Although public executions have been discontinued, provincial cities still hold mass sentencing rallies, during which convicts wearing confessional placards are driven though the streets in open trucks.
The practice has also taken hold in some Chinese neighborhoods of New York, with some supermarket owners threatening to post photographs of shoplifters and call the police unless the suspects hand over cash, sometimes demanding hundreds of dollars. The legality of the practice, however, remains in question.

It is unclear whether the directive against the humiliation of suspects will have the desired effect. Similar rules and regulations have been passed down through the years, beginning in 1988, when the Supreme People's Court ordered prosecutors and the police to protect the identities of the accused. In 2007, the country's top judicial and law enforcement bodies issued a similar notice that forbade the parading of convicts.
Even if such directives must be issued repeatedly, Joshua Rosenzweig of the Dui Hua Foundation, a human rights group, said he was somewhat encouraged that the government recognized the need to abolish such practices.
“Repetition can increase pressure and help force change, but ultimately it will take a great deal of political will to implement these kinds of changes,” he said.
The past year has seen an unprecedented wave of Republican bills to drug test the poor and jobless. It also saw a smaller wave of Democratic bills that said in response, "No, you pee in the cup."
One of the most recent retorts comes from Georgia, where last month Democratic state Rep. Scott Holcomb introduced a bill requiring members of the local legislature to prove they're not Legislating Under the Influence. Holcomb told HuffPost he came up with the idea because he was struck by a bill from his Republican colleagues to drug test welfare applicants.
"I was really struck by how awful it was," he said. "I wanted to bring some attention to it."
Democrats in Florida, Ohio and Tennessee have done the same thing. Tennessee state representative G.A. Hardaway said his bill to test lawmakers was inspired by constituents annoyed with a Republican welfare-drug-testing bill. "They said to me, 'how do we know y'all aren't on drugs?'" Hardaway told local TV station WMC-TV. "I thought, well, you don't."
The trend started in Florida, the only place where the local government actually followed through with welfare drug testing -- at least until a federal judge ruled it a flagrant violation of the Constitution's ban on unreasonable search and seizure four months after the policy took effect. During that brief period, a mere 2.5 percent of welfare applicants tested positive for drugs.
A spokesman for Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) told HuffPost in September that the governor would be willing to submit to testing himself. But when Comedy Central's "Daily Show" presented him with a cup the following December, he declined to pee in it. Scott's attorney general Pam Bondi played along and provided the Daily Show with a cup labeled "Pam Bondi" filled with a yellowish liquid. A Bondi spokeswoman confirmed to HuffPost that the liquid was, in fact, apple juice from the cafeteria.
The drug testing action in the states eventually percolated to the U.S. Congress. In December Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) introduced a bill to require states to screen unemployment insurance claimants for drugs. A version of Kingston's legislation was included in a broader bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives but failed in the Senate.
Assistant Minority Leader Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.) called the Republican drug test scheme unfair and insulting. "I don't see anyone in the Republican majority demanding drug testing for folks who receive oil and gas subsidies," he said.
A spokesman for Kingston said the congressman would take a look at Holcomb's bill, but said "it's a separate point from what Congressman Kingston is trying to address with his proposal."
Holcomb doesn't view his bill as a separate point: "If they're gonna play this game, this is how we're gonna play it."
Asked how many of his colleagues he suspected might flunk a drug screen, Holcomb said he didn't know.
"I would hope none," he said. "Why would there be an assumption that someone on welfare would fail?"
Conservation officer Frank DeBoon says someone went for a drive recently in the Baynes Lake area south of Fernie, spotted a herd of elk and shot into it, dropping three cows where they stood.
Deboon says the three females, who were likely pregnant, were then left there to die. In 26 years as a conservation officer, DeBoon says he's never seen anything like it.

"It's pretty upsetting to see somebody who would just go and shoot animals and leave them to waste," he told CBC News.
Deboon estimates it happened about a week ago. He says the shooter or shooters didn't take anything.
"The elk were all in good health, probably pregnant with this year's calves. There's no reason for it other than somebody deciding to shoot them."
DeBoon says they'll likely get away with it too. The site of the shooting is off a fairly remote logging road and unless there was more than one person in the vehicle, there are likely no witnesses.
Still DeBoon wants the story out there. He's hoping someone either heard the shots, or or perhaps stories from someone bragging about their hunting prowess.
The shooting comes after nearly a dozen elk were shot and butchered by poachers on Vancouver Island last year.

The star cluster R136 is already home to the largest known star in the universe, a giant more than 250 times the mass of the sun. Now, astronomers observing the cluster in ultraviolet light using the Hubble Space Telescope have found a total of nine stars with masses of more than 100 suns, the largest collection of very massive stars found to date. This pack of heavyweights—located in the Tarantula Nebula (shown above with R136 right of center) some 170,000 light-years from Earth—burns bright and fast, collectively outshining the sun 30 million times and ejecting every month material equivalent to the mass of Earth. But how they form is a mystery—the current theory of star formation cannot explain how such behemoths could come together from the collapse of a cloud of gas and dust. It has been suggested that they grow through the merger of pairs of binary stars but, as the team explains today in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, current understanding of binary mergers cannot explain this number of giants in close proximity. The team plans to continue observing R136 with Hubble in visible light, searching for binaries that could merge to produce such massive stars.
Jennifer Robinson, Mr Assange's lawyer, said that she believes US prosecutors are finalising their case and charges could be "imminent".
Were he to be charged, it is likely to be under the Espionage Act, which makes prosecutes the gathering of national defence information if it is known to have been obtained illegally and could be used to the detriment of the US. It is also illegal to fail to return information to the US government.
Speaking to ABC News, Miss Robinson said she had heard a number of rumours from "several different US lawyers", but added that she did not believe the Espionage Act applied to Assange, who is she added is currently in solitary confinement in Wandsworth prison in London.
The speculation came amid reports that computer hackers allegedly attacked the websites of Dutch police and prosecutors in revenge for the arrest of a 16-year-old schoolboy who was allegedly part of a worldwide army of "cyber guerrillas" sympathetic to WikiLeaks.
Both sites were only sporadically available on Friday after being attacked by a group of "hacktivists" called Anonymous, Dutch media reported.
Computer experts warned Wikileaks supporters were downloading increasing amounts of spam-shooting software that has been used to attack companies regarded as hostile to Wikileaks, including MasterCard, PayPal and Amazon.
Downloads of a programme used to bombard websites with bogus requests for data have jumped to more than 40,000 in the last few days, according to Imperva, an American data security company.
WikiLeaks advocates have accused MasterCard, Amazon and other corporations of caving into pressure from the American government, which has condemned the freedom of information website for publishing some of the 250,000 secret or classified diplomatic cables that it acquired.
Anonymous appeared to backtrack from attacks launched earlier this week, saying that it now does not plan to target the "critical infrastructure of companies such as MasterCard, Visa, PayPal, or Amazon."
A press release circulated under the Anonymous name said its members did not want to alienate the public by causing online havoc over Christmas as it would be "in bad taste".
Amazon was accused of hypocrisy, meanwhile, after repackaging the Wikileaks diplomatic cables and offering them for sale to customers, just days after cutting off the website from its servers.
‘Out Of The Black' is Boys Noize's third full-length studio album. The LP, which is expected to release on October 8th, features 12 tracks of unruly, schizophrenic, acid-driven techno. Charging out of the gates with “This is what you want, this is what you get,” there's no shortage of analog bass sequences and distortion. Some might argue that Alex Ridha is going back to his Oi Oi Oi roots.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of a Brazilian bishop who was accused of turning a blind eye to suspected pedophile priests in his diocese, the Vatican said on Wednesday.

The Vatican said Francis had accepted the resignation of Bishop Aldo di Cillo Pagotto of Paraiba, 66, citing a section of Church law under which bishops are obliged to tender their resignation if they are ill or if there is “grave cause”.
Under normal circumstances, he would have remained bishop until he turned 75.
Last year, the Church stripped Pagotto of his power to ordain priests while the accusations against him were being investigated.
Pagatto had been accused of allowing men into seminaries in his diocese to become priests even though they had been rejected from other places in Brazil because they were suspected child abusers.
In a letter posted on the diocese's website, Pagotto said:
“I welcomed priests and seminarians with the intention of offering them new opportunities in life. Some were later suspected of committing serious wrongdoings ... I made mistakes by trusting too much, with naive mercy.”
Last month, Francis issued a new decree saying bishops found to have been negligent when dealing with cases of sexual abuse could be investigated and removed from office if they did not offer to resign..
The decree requires the Vatican to launch an investigation if “serious evidence” of negligence is found. The bishop is given the opportunity to defend himself. Ultimately, the Vatican can issue a decree to remove him or ask him to resign within 15 days.
A Vatican spokesman said Pagatto's case was handled under the previous, existing, procedures.
The Catholic Church has been rocked over the past 15 years by scandals over priests who sexually abused children and were transferred by bishops from parish to parish instead of being turned over to authorities and defrocked.
In some developed countries, particularly in the United States, the Church has paid tens of millions of dollars in settlements to victims.

A tech pilot scheme to be launched this year in Estonia could set an example for future developments worldwide in how listed companies handle shareholder governance.
US stock-market firm Nasdaq is aiming to give Estonian e-residents and Estonian citizens who are shareholders in firms listed on its Tallinn stock exchange an opportunity to vote securely online in shareholder meetings.
The potential significance of the pilot scheme is the electronic system's speed and efficiency compared with traditional proxy-based voting.
For the e-voting process, Estonia's e-residency platform will be used to authenticate e-resident shareholders in shareholder meetings. Nasdaq's blockchain technology, based on the distributed public ledger that underpins Bitcoin transactions, will be then applied to record votes quickly and securely.
Another potential advantage of this approach is that it could entice more people to join the country's e-residency initiative.
E-residency project head Kaspar Korjus believes that the collaboration with Nasdaq isn't just good for his country's plan to give Estonian citizens and residents a digital identity, or for the local stock exchange, but it could be a starting point for something bigger.
"When we started the e-residency project a year ago, we knew we would change the way people think about nations and citizenship. Now, with our e-voting collaboration with Nasdaq, we will be revolutionizing corporate governance," he said in a statement.
The concept of Estonian e-residency emerged in 2014 as a transnational digital identity, available to anyone in the world interested in administering a location-independent business online.
Applicants for e-residency are fingerprinted and background-checked by the Estonian state. Once approved, the new e-resident is issued an electronic ID card which, in combination with a four-digit pin, can be used for secure digital identification.
E-resident entrepreneurs and freelancers can open and run location-independent businesses online, apply for a bank account and conduct e-banking, get access to international payment service providers, declare taxes, sign all relevant documents and contracts remotely-- these digital signatures have the same legal status as handwritten ones -- and get easier access to EU markets.
By the end of February over 9,200 people from over 127 countries had applied for Estonian e-residency, with citizens of Finland, Russia, and the US being the most interested in it. Some 94 percent of applicants, or 8,669, people have been approved so far. Altogether, they have founded 291 companies.
Co-operation with Estonia is also very important for Nasdaq because blockchain technology is a new development area, which in the words of Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld "could revolutionize the core of capital markets infrastructure systems".
In fact, proxy voting is only the second official blockchain project that Nasdaq has undertaken, the first being private securities issuance between an investor and company, which was announced in December last year.
For this transaction, Nasdaq enabled the issuer to represent a record of ownership digitally using Nasdaq Linq, while significantly reducing settlement time and eliminating the need for paper stock certificates.
Nasdaq plans to test blockchain technology as an alternative to other traditional processes, such as expediting trade settlements for transactions in public markets.
"On the heels of the successful execution of a blockchain transaction in the US private market, we are pleased to further advance this technology in Estonia," Nasdaq president Hans-Ole Jochumsen said in a statement, adding that Estonia was chosen for the e-voting pilot, because of its "robust information society and forward thinking coupled with the agility its size affords".
Jochumsen said Nasdaq is looking forward "to working closely with the government of Estonia to set a transformative example of the future of governance".

Dr. Charles Modlin, a Cleveland Clinic urologist and one of just 17 black transplant surgeons in the United States, has spent the past 18 years working to eliminate health care disparities in minority populations. This impressive career, both in and out of the operating room, began with a choice that came long before college: music or medicine.
“I really enjoyed studying science, but I also enjoyed playing the trumpet,” Modlin said. While he had considered becoming a physician at a young age, it was in high school, when he helped care for his grandmother, that his decision was made. “My mother moved my grandmother, who was in her 80s, into our house for a while, and I helped take care of her. Later on, we had to put her into a nursing home. My mom would go visit her every day and take us with. I'd help take care of her, get her water, take her to get lunch.”
That inherent compassion, coupled with the support of his tight-knit central Indiana community, are what Modlin credits with steering him into medicine. Later, during his surgical residency in medical school at Northwestern University — where Modlin also completed his undergraduate degree — he chooses to specialize in urology.
“I'm grateful that Northwestern gave me a strong educational foundation, a well-rounded experience. I did many of my clinical rotations at Evanston Hospital, and was fortunate enough to rotate through the VA as well. Also, there was a program run by the students where we went to Cabrini-Green and interacted with a lot of the youth from that area of Chicago. I think that gave me the opportunity to learn about the community outreach that I do now.”
Medical training, particularly surgical subspecialty training like Modlin's choice of kidney transplantation, is lengthy — 17 years from undergraduate to fellowship — and comes with a grueling schedule. It wasn't until Modlin was on staff at the Cleveland Clinic in 1996 that he was able to take a broader view of the overall medical landscape.
“It was then that I could really develop an appreciation for how certain populations fared differently. I read a report in the late '90s, the ‘Healthy People 2000' report that came from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It really emphasized the impact that health care disparities have, especially on African American and other minority populations. In that report, they challenged health care institutions, individual physicians and health care providers to play a role in terms of eliminating those disparities.”
Modlin approached the Cleveland Clinic's chief of staff and proposed developing a formalized program to address health care gaps of minorities. “We called in some community leaders, as well as Congressman Louis Stokes and Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones [both from Cleveland].” Once the program had support, Modlin realized it would be to everyone's benefit to start with what he knew best: urology.
In 2003, Modlin organized the Cleveland Clinic's first Minority Men's Health Fair. That grew into a permanent Minority Men's Health Center, for which Modlin is the current director.
Rather than open up the Minority Men's Health Center and expect people to come, Modlin went out and engaged with the community. “We joined community organizations and went to churches. [Patients] had to know that we were out there for their best interest.”
And progress has been made. “We've created a very innovative Center,” Modlin said. “A lot of the individuals who come to the Minority Men's Health Center or Health Fair have indicated were it not for this particular type of venue, this dedicated center for them, they never would have come in to undergo evaluations. And through those evaluations, we have discovered a number of conditions. We've found a lot of cases of prostate cancer, a 30 percent incidence of hypertension, diabetes, hepatitis C, HIV, stress, depression, mental health issues—a number of conditions where the patients did not know they were preexisting.”
The Minority Men's Health Center and its mission continue to grow. Name notwithstanding, it also helps women navigate the health care system and encourages them to undergo preventative health screenings. Modlin's work planted the seed for his dermatology colleagues to start the Multicultural Hair and Skin Center, and he has been in touch with leaders in orthopedics, cardiovascular medicine, and sickle-cell disease research. “I'm trying to broaden our health care disparity objectives and initiatives so that we are not just doing what we're doing in urology — we are doing it across the board at Cleveland Clinic.”
While his career is thriving in Ohio and he is passionate about his work, Modlin said, “I'll always be a Northwestern guy.” He's served two terms on Northwestern's Feinberg School of Medicine Alumni Board, and he's considering more formal service to the school. Additionally, his medical school graduating class is working to endow a scholarship in medicine, and Modlin is excited about them closing in on their goal of raising $100,000. He also helped establish an alumni lecture series for medical students, for which Northwestern graduates not only return to speak on various topics, but also interact with and mentor students. (Modlin was the first to participate.)
“Northwestern really provides a unique opportunity,” he said. “Just walking up and down Sheridan Road there, you look out over Lake Michigan and the Chicago skyline. It's inspiring! I will always be committed to Northwestern. I will always try to give back to the university in several ways. In everything I do, I am proud to let people know that I'm a Northwestern alumnus.”

PITTSBURGH -- After winning two games at home, the Nashville Predators will attempt to maintain that momentum on the road against the Pittsburgh Penguins.
The Predators and Penguins each have won twice at home through four games. Pittsburgh would like to continue that trend in Game 5 at PPG Paints Arena on Thursday, when Nashville will look for a third straight victory before heading home for Game 6.
Here are 5 keys for Game 5:
1. Penguins' goalie situation
For the first time in his NHL career, goalie Matt Murray had two straight lackluster starts in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. After allowing five goals on 33 shots in Game 3, he surrendered three on 25 shots in Game 4.
Though Murray will start Game 5, by losing consecutive starts for the first time in 30 career NHL playoff games he allowed his standing as Pittsburgh's No. 1 goalie to be questioned.
With how well Marc-Andre Fleury played in the first two rounds, a bounce-back effort could solidify Murray's position as the series nears its end.
"I know that Matt is excited to play tonight," coach Mike Sullivan said. "He certainly has had success here at home."
Including the regular season, Murray is 21-3-2 with a 2.32 goals-against average and .928 save percentage at PPG Paints Arena.
2. Can Pekka Rinne stay hot?
Like Murray, Rinne has struggled on the road; he allowed eight goals on 36 shots in the first two games of the Final. However, he responded well in the next two games.
Rinne made 50 saves on 52 shots in Games 3 and 4 and has seemed to find his footing after a shaky start to the Final. If that continues in Game 5, Pittsburgh could struggle to score again.
"If he sees every puck, he's going to stop every puck," Predators defenseman Mattias Ekholm said.

3. Pittsburgh reuniting 'Sid and the Kids'
Right wing Conor Sheary is expected to move from the fourth line to the first next to center Sidney Crosby and left wing Jake Guentzel. Sheary has six points (one goal, five assists) in the playoffs after finishing with 53 points (23 goals, 30 assists) in 61 games during his second NHL season.
Sheary was most impactful with Crosby and Guentzel during the regular season. By reuniting that line, the Penguins hope to receive a spark.
"We've struggled a little bit in the playoffs," Sheary said. "I obviously got moved off that line, but hopefully we can find that chemistry again."

4. Nashville remaining desperate
Although the Predators have seemingly built some momentum, coach Peter Laviolette doesn't think that will carry them in Game 5.
Though the Predators are coming off two straight wins, Laviolette said he still thinks they should be more desperate than the Penguins. If that turns out to be true, he thinks they could take a 3-2 series lead.
"Usually desperation wins the day," Laviolette said. "If you have a team that's got momentum and a team that's got desperation, for me anyway, the scarier team is the one that's got desperation."
5. More from Phil Kessel
Kessel has yet to score a goal through four games this series. If Evgeni Malkin is correct, that will change in Game 5.
After Pittsburgh's practice Wednesday, Malkin predicted Kessel would score in Game 5. He had some quality chances in the past three games after being held without a shot in Game 1 but failed to get any of his nine shots past Rinne.
Kessel could help the Penguins retake the series lead if he's able to break out Thursday.

AppDynamics CEO David Wadhwani Dan Frommer, Business Insider AppDynamics, a company that sells software for application performance management (APM), today submitted its S-1 regulatory filing kicking off the process to go public.
The company is seeking to raise $100 million in the deal, and it's looking to trade on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol APPD, according to the filing.
The lead underwriters are Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Barclays, UBS, Wells Fargo, William Blair, and JMP Securities.
In the nine months that ended on October 31, AppDynamics posted a $95 million net loss on $158.4 million in revenue. That means revenue was up considerably year over year despite the ongoing loss: The nine months that ended on October 31, 2015, AppDynamics registered a $92.3 million loss on $102.7 million in revenue. Most of the revenue comes from subscriptions, but licenses and professional services also make contributions to the top line.
AppDynamics has been in a position to go public for a while. One of its top competitors, New Relic, went public in 2014. Other competitors named in the filing include Dynatrace, BMC, CA, HP, and Microsoft. Unlike New Relic, AppDynamics can be run in companies' on-premises data centers, and not just as a cloud service.
AppDynamics started in 2008 and is based in San Francisco. It had 1,186 employees as of October 31, according to the filing.
Last year AppDynamics appointed David Wadhwani as its chief executive, replacing cofounder Jyoti Bansal.
John Shinkle/POLITICO Republican lawmakers threaten to kill Iran deal Obama will need to rally at least 34 senators to his defense as Congress reviews final agreement.
It will be days before Congress receives the full nuclear agreement with Iran and all of its classified annexes for review, but hawkish GOP lawmakers immediately began picking apart the final deal reached early Tuesday as “dangerous” and a “possible death sentence for Israel.”
Congressional Republicans have been warning President Barack Obama against a deal with Tehran for months, telling him to simply walk away as the negotiations dragged on past initial deadlines. But in the wee hours Tuesday, the administration announced a final deal to scale back Iran's nuclear program and ease strict economic sanctions, so GOP critics' job has shifted to building support in Congress to scuttle the deal by blocking Obama's ability to lift those sanctions.
Story Continued Below
“You've created a possible death sentence for Israel,” fumed Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on MSNBC's “Morning Joe.” “This is the most dangerous, irresponsible step I've ever seen in the history of watching the Mideast.”
House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) — who got a call from Obama on Monday night that an Iran deal was “imminent” — accused the president of not keeping his word on dismantling Iran's nuclear infrastructure and holding sanctions to Iran until international investigators verified that the country's leadership is holding up its end of the bargain. Boehner said Obama “has abandoned his own goals.”
“What I know of it thus far is unacceptable,” Boehner told reporters. “It's going to hand a dangerous regime billions of dollars in sanctions relief while paving the way for a nuclear Iran.”
“If it is in fact as bad a deal as I think it is at this moment, we're going to do everything we can to stop it,” Boehner added.
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) also reiterated the GOP hardline on the Iran agreement. “We will fight hard to reject this deal with every tool that we have,” vowed Scalise.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the deal appeared to further the administration's “flawed” approach and said Congress's job is now to “weigh why a nuclear agreement should result in reduced pressure on the world's leading state sponsor of terror.”
The GOP-led Congress plans to review the deal for two months before voting on whether to lift sanctions sometime in September, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told reporters on Monday night. Obama will need to rally at least 34 senators to his defense to blow up a veto-proof majority, and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) is already predicting that Obama will struggle to do so.
“The American people are going to repudiate this deal, and I believe Congress will kill the deal,” Cotton said on Morning Joe.
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said that he anticipated that Congress would at the very least withhold majority support for the deal, if not vote to block it altogether.
“Failure by the president to obtain congressional support will tell the Iranians and the world that this is Barack Obama's deal, not an agreement with lasting support from the United States,” said Rubio, who has vowed to scuttle the deal if he becomes president.
Of course, most Republicans were already likely to oppose any deal. And though the party has large majorities on Capitol Hill, the GOP will need to persuade Democrats to buck the president.
Obama kicked off his latest sales job on Tuesday morning, vowing in a statement from the White House to veto any legislation that would threaten the deal.
With Vice President Joe Biden at his side, Obama said he welcomed a “robust debate” in Congress but urged lawmakers to think of the alternative to the deal negotiators struck — a greater chance of more war in the Middle East.
“We give nothing up by testing whether or not this problem can be solved peacefully,” Obama said.
In the first hours after the deal's announcement, Democrats pledged to delve deeply into the deal's details and warned they won't support an agreement that strengthens Iran's hand.
Among the lines in the sand Democrats have drawn: Keeping Iran from receiving immediate sanctions relief, allowing intrusive inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities and preventing Tehran from exporting weapons that could be used to further destabilize the Middle East.
“I will only support it if this deal prevents every Iranian pathway to develop a nuclear weapons capability,” said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), a member of Corker's committee, on Tuesday morning.
“It is in America's national security interest that Iran is blocked from ever having a nuclear weapon,” said Foreign Relations ranking member Ben Cardin (D-Md.). “There is no trust when it comes to Iran.”
The central focus of the GOP's lobbying effort will be members like Coons and Cardin, viewed as the swing senators who will be the key to blocking a deal or backing up the president. Two other crucial Democrats, Senate Democratic leader-in-waiting Chuck Schumer of New York and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, scrapped a press conference on Puerto Rico, with the press likely to instead deluge them with questions about the Iran deal.
Corker will likely begin a series of hearings probing the deal later this July before Congress heads home for a lengthy summer recess. Corker has been warning against the direction that negotiations were tilting in Vienna, but has also been conciliatory to the administration by not signing onto Cotton's letter to Iranian leadership.
On Tuesday morning Corker said he starts from a place of “deep skepticism,” one of the more charitable Republican sentiments toward Obama's negotiating acumen. His counterpart across the Capitol, House Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.), called it a “tough sell.”
“Iran won't even have to cheat on this agreement to be a small step away from the bomb, dominate the region and boost its oppressive regime at home,” said Royce, who met with Corker on Monday evening to plot a review strategy for Republicans. “Iran's regime is now claiming to be a winner.”
But the president received a booster shot from top Democratic leaders in the Capitol. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) — who heard from Obama on Monday night that a deal was coming shortly — dubbed the agreement an “historic accord” and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who also spoke with Obama by phone Monday night about the negotiations, praised Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry for clinching a “historic deal.”

EXCLUSIVE: Charlton join foreign legion as Belgian millionaire agrees takeover deal
Charlton is the latest English club to come under foreign ownership with a deal agreed on Friday night with Belgian millionaire and political activist Roland Duchatelet.
The business tycoon who made his fortune in electronics is understood to have paid a cut-price £14m for the London club who are currently lying sixth from bottom in the Championship.
Addicks chairman Michael Slater confirmed the news on the club's official website www.cafc.co.uk on Saturday, stating: 'Very constructive discussions are ongoing which we hope to conclude soon.'
Takeover time: Charlton (Yann Kermorgant, pictured right) are the latest club to have a foreign owner Spreading his wings: Standard's chairman Roland Duchatelet has agreed a deal with the Addicks
The takeover follows the collapse last month at the due diligence stage of a proposed purchase of Charlton by American sports franchise owner Josh Harris.
There was considerable urgency for a new owner to be found as London property developer Kevin Cash, who has been bankrolling Charlton, was no longer prepared to put in further funding.
Duchatelet is a high profile figure in Belgium where he owns Standard Liege, the current leaders of the Belgian Pro League, as well as founding a small social liberal political party Vivant who believe in a basic minimum wage for all.
He paid around £35m to buy Standard Liege in 2011. But fans were furious with his policy of selling the club's best players leading to pitch invasions and demonstrations in the streets of Liege.
But Duchatelet's appointment of unknown 38-year-old Isreali coach Guy Luzon last summer has helped turn around supporter opinion of the owner with Luzon leading Liege to the top of the table.
A new Edmonton meal-sharing system has been shut down by Alberta Health Services, leaving local entrepreneurs out of pocket $60,000 and home cooks without customers.
Scarf, a software platform that connected cooks who had extra dinner servings with hungry Edmontonians, launched in late September. Through an online application, the company posted meals that were prepared daily in home kitchens. Folks in core Edmonton neighbourhoods who wanted an alternative to prepare their own meals could order a meal, pay for it and pick it up, via the digital platform.
But Alberta Health Services issued a cease-and-desist order to Scarf, shutting down the meal sharing service last month. In a written statement, Alberta Health Services said its duty is to “keep Albertans safe.”
“This includes working with food operators to ensure they are meeting the provincial standards required to serve safe and healthy food to Albertans,” reads the statement.
AHS says all kitchens producing food for public consumption must have proper permits. Scarf cooks did not have those permits.
Scarf operator Kian Parseyan says he tried to talk Alberta Health Services into working on a pilot project that would provide Edmontonians with a new, safe and reasonably priced meal alternative (Scarf's meals went for roughly $10 each). He developed safety standards for his cooks that met and exceeded industry standards, he says, including police checks and random kitchen checks every three months.
Parseyan says he tried for three months to get Alberta Health Services involved in the project, but with no luck. He decided to start it anyway because, strictly speaking, he wasn't operating the kitchens, only the software system. AHS said no.
“The operator's actions put AHS in a position of taking legal steps to protect public health,” reads a statement provided by AHS.
AHS says it offered to help Parseyan operate within the confines of the legislation. “We are here to help Albertans serve safe food and to support them in complying with the regulations that are designed to protect our health and the safe delivery of these operations.”
The statement continues: “Our efforts also help protect the owners and employees of food establishments. Anyone who is operating or working for an unapproved business without a permit is taking a substantial risk.”
So it's game over for Scarf, says Parseyan, who had no desire to fight AHS in court. He hopes to sell his innovative platform, which could have applications outside of food.
“As individuals we're going to move on and suffer our losses,” says Parseyan, who estimates that working on this project full-time for a year cost between $60,000 and $70,000. “Sometimes that's what happens in entrepreneurship. It's big risks and rewards.”
Ultimately, he is saddened that AHS wouldn't look at a pilot project. He sees the Scarf platform as a variation on Uber or airbnb, which disrupt the status quo, but often in a good way.
“Ultimately what happened is not the fault of the executives or inspectors at AHS or anybody who made the decision at AHS. The ultimate fault is society. We choose how regulatory operations operate.”
AHS has “no incentives to innovate,” he adds.
“We are a headache to them. Unless there is a specific, organizational, structural change within AHS or other organizational structures, we'll just see innovation crushed.”
“My call to action to people is if you want that changed, demand that from your MLAs. Government organizations are falling behind and there is no incentive to keep ahead.”

John Plumtree didn't bring the lineout maul with him from Durban but it's undoubtedly become a potent Irish weapon again.
It shouldn't be a massive revelation to state that Joe Schmidt has chosen his forwards coach wisely. But this past fortnight we've seen a dangerous edge return to the pack. Schmidt is running the show but some dark words must have been exchanged away from the prying ears of the backline.
On arrival in this country Plumtree called his new charges good but not great, and duly waited for a response.
Niall O'Donovan used to seek similar reactions from his forwards, first at Shannon then Munster then Ireland. If there was a punch up in training he would be visibly happy. That's a great session in his book. If we were willing to kick the shit out of each other God help the enemy.
I remember a massive punch up one day training out on Thomond Park. We were getting ready for a big European game but the enthusiastic younger fellas tried to pull down a lineout maul from an offside position.
It got out of hand when the Clohessy brothers, Dessie and Peter, swapped digs. Everyone waded in. Naturally I was stuck in the middle of it and a young Donncha O'Callaghan landed a few sneaky punches. He was laying down a marker himself.
When the messing abated, Niall O pulled us around him. He was delighted. Couldn't ask for anymore.
It's the same with Ireland of late. Real aggression is evident on the training pitch in Carton House. That's a desire to be the dominant force in every game. That's healthy. Being a successful coach in South Africa, Plumtree arrived with the highest expectations of what a forward pack should be able to achieve. Especially at set piece and the physical stakes.
We now see the proof as soon as Rory Best takes the ball into his hands. Since the dawn of rugby, Irish teams, Lord knows Munster in particular, have mined for jewels with the maul. It's in our DNA but still what a welcome surprise to see it yielding three tries in our opening two Six Nations games.
The best thing about a powerful maul is how mentally draining, never mind the sagging legs, it can be on the opposition. They know its coming but they can't do anything about it. If it's put together quickly and in a structurally sound way it's impossible to legally stop.
Illegally as well with the best example being Jamie Heaslip's try against Scotland. Rory threw to Dan Tuohy who deftly slipped it off to Chris Henry veering to the right with Heaslip snuggling in behind his flanker as Mike Ross, Cian Healy and Peter O'Mahony bludgeoned a path.
That immediate change of direction took Tim Swinson, big Jim Hamilton and Ryan Grant out of the equation. No team will stop a fully stacked maul without their locks and a prop. That's good research. Identify who tends to pull down the maul (Hamilton) and move the point of contact away from him with Dev Toner as the decoy/barrier.
All pre-planned and executed like an airplane crashing to earth. The left wing (Toner) was dragged off the main body by a desperate Scottish body with the nose of the plane – Healy, Ross and O'Mahony – only tearing off when their cargo was safely over the try line.
Untold advantage
Against Wales it was different but the same. Best threw to Toner – whose height lends an untold advantage to this ploy - who along with Ross and O'Mahony acted as decoys, or static bodies that Welsh forwards focused on, as Henry nestled in behind Best and Heaslip with Healy and O'Connell either side of him.
Heaslip could have been done for blocking but Barnes had an unimpaired view.
Plumtree, writing a column for SA Rugby magazine last year, explained the same technique behind the Springbok/Bulls excellent maul: “Generally they win the ball where they want to win it in the lineout – on Juandré Kruger or just behind him on Pierre Spies – which is important.
“They pack even numbers on either side of the jumper very quickly and the ripper (who has taken the ball from the jumper) slips to the back of the maul, with his mates protecting him from the opposition. They also get very low and tight and work hard for each other. If the opposition haven't taken out the lifters and jumper quickly, so they can get closer to the ball, then the Bulls or Boks invariably score the try. The try-scorer is normally the ripper and/or the hooker, and while he does the least work he gets the glory!”
Change the names Kruger and Spies for any one of Toner, O'Connell, O'Mahony, Heaslip.
Paddy Jackson's try that added further humiliation to Wales' plight last Saturday proves more than anything that Plumtree, O'Connell, Best and the rest have spent hours sharpening this blunt force since November.
This time the lineout was on the 22 – which is miles for a maul to travel – with Seán Cronin throwing to O'Mahony as Toner ran a decoy to the front. “Once,” Wayne Barnes quickly warned Conor Murray but the Irish pack knew they had the legs and perfect shape to trundle onwards (especially after O'Mahony tore Toby Fatelau's arm out of its socket when he tried the spoil).
Again the Welsh were fooled with four of them – including Sam Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones – tearing down the wrong section as O'Mahony and Marty Moore happily landing on top of them. The numerical advantage, which is what makes the maul so effective, prompted Leigh Halfpenny to abandon his position, which Murray immediately spotted and put Jackson away with a neat skip pass. What made that last maul so impressive was Tommy O'Donnell, Jack McGrath, Cronin and Moore were off the bench and still they knew precisely what their individual roles entailed.
Structural base
That's what Plumtree was hired to do. Provide the structural base and let the players build a monstrously effective machine. Schmidt might be the undisputed boss with many of the praise and plaudits being laid at his feet but the Kiwi has so clearly been afforded the pitch time to construct a very South African looking set piece.
He may be born and bred in New Zealand but the 48-year-old played most of his career for Natal before returning to South Africa, via Wellington and Swansea, to lead the Sharks to Currie Cup success.
And no team wins that competition without an awesome maul.
Not that it's all him, mind. I've no doubt Paulie, Rory, Jamie and O'Mahony – leaders from the provinces – weren't long warming to the idea of building a maul to be feared by mixing up their knowledge. Best was already influenced by the Natal think-tank having played alongside Johann Muller and Ruan Pienaaer.
The beauty of the maul is the fear it instils in opposing packs.
Now what Ireland has achieved in such a small space of time is admirable as they don't have a Bakkies Botha or John Hayes anymore. Mountains of men, when they walk the maul moves, I've seen Hayes take the impact of three charging forwards and still hold O'Connell at full stretch.
Anthony Foley was another with that strong base to bring the jumper down.
So technique is everything. The guy lifting from behind the jumper must be so powerful. Ross and O'Mahony both do decent impressions of Hayes. When that's done correctly, and the initial assault is fended away, the switch and body positions ignites the tank.
At Munster we also used it to march out of sticky positions. Mostly to create field position so Rog could clear our lines. And we used it to intimidate teams.
Ultimate mauling side
In 2002 we came up against the ultimate mauling side in the Heineken Cup final. When Leicester got lineout ball to Martin Johnson or Ben Kay nearly every team bowed down as Neil Back usually cranked it into gear behind Rowntree, Garforth, West, Cockeril.
They mauled everyone off the field that year. We focused on stopping them. The key is to not let it develop. As Scotland and Wales learned, it's a number game. We just made sure there were at least six of us piling into them from the lineout. The Tigers kept at it but that's not what won them the game. They won because they were better but we made them sweat blood over every inch.
It went out of the game for a few years because you were allowed sack players in the air and a lot of referees were penalising for blocking. But the maul is back and Plumtree has made sure if he is the Ireland forwards coach then it will be part of the arsenal.
It's about laying down a marker as you walk slowly into a lineout five metres out. You know the opposition know what you are going to do and you know what you are going to do. You also believe they won't be able to stop you. That gees you up.
Will Ireland employ it so effectively and so much at Twickenham? I'm not sure. But that's certainly what the English expect now. What we do know about Schmidt is he is smarter than most of us. He'll be aware that Stuart Lancaster will forensically examine ways to counteract Ireland's maul. They will break down every single lineout. They will also seek to maul the hell out of us. Nothing finds the voice of a Twickenham crowd like a rolling maul.
It's up to Plumtree to have a strategy to move the point of contact again. It won't be easy but the tools are in place and that's the hard part done.
I'll leave you not with Plumtree's signing off: “The maul, what a beautiful thing.”
His new pack of forwards so clearly agree.
The now infamous case of a 7 year old being suspended for eating a pastry such that the uneaten portion vaguely resembled a gun raises the question: Does anything that vaguely resembles the shape of a gun a clear and present danger to the safety and security of students? For the “zero tolerance” nutjobs, it is clear that everything from stick figures to fingers, and now pastries, are dangers capable of causing death and destruction.
The logical thing would be to restrict the options for punishment by school officials against students who draw guns or have things vaguely shaped like a gun. Until such sanity finally overtakes the “zero tolerance” crowd, here is a chart of dangerous objects to not have in order to avoid the wrath of those “zero tolerance” idjits:
Of course, the schools would probably prefer outlawing “assault pastries” and “assault fingers.” What the difference between a regular finger and an “assault finger” would be is anyones guess…

TINY METAL Programmer about 2 hours ago
Calm down guys, we had an ex-employee who it turns out has made a career of sweet-talking his way into jobs he is not qualified for. After causing months of pain for everyone in the office we bit the bullet and bought out his contract. Afterwards I heard from people he worked with in past companies that he has been fired from about 5-7 game companies so far.
After he was let go with a generous severance package (about 3 months salary, money he did not earn by any definition of the word). He then turned around and stopped paying his rent thus trying to extract more money from us. So when he claims Project Phoenix money was used in TINY METAL keep in mind the truth is everyone except him has worked hard and at times with zero pay to be able to get investment for TINY METAL for the exact reason that we never used Project Phoenix money for TINY METAL. In fact other employees lent him money and had their own paychecks delayed so he could be paid on time.
Likewise when he writes "I left" the truth is "I was fired 3 months ago and am only writing these lies now because I want the company I barely contributed to, to pay my rent while I go on holidays to America with my severance package instead of paying the rent I owe".
The news breaking on social media right now that the Nissan GT-R LM is to miss the pre-season WEC Prologue test and the first two rounds of the Championship at Silverstone and Spa is very disappointing, but not entirely unsurprising.
The concept of Nissan's 2015 LMP1 contender redefines the phrase ‘cutting edge' with almost every aspect of the design new and/ or unproven in competition.
It was always going to be a mountain to climb to get the car to the track in truly competitive form with such a short run-in from finished design to racing.
Beyond the already mighty task in hand to build and develop the car there have been other issues too – many outside the control of the team, and the additional testing time will be vital to ensure that the GT-R LMs hit the ground running at Le Mans.
There will of course be a multitude of disappointed fans who may miss their first, or only, chance to see the new Nissan race. It's a car that has cultivated interest like no other. It's launch day saw more people reading DSC than ANY other day in our 15 year history.
Pragmatists though will conclude that this is a sensible decision, and we can only hope that Nissan's higher ups agree that the delay in the car's debut brings opportunities for a more competitive showing when we do see the car run and race in June.
Kellogg Community College is the only community college in Michigan and one of fewer than 20 colleges and universities in the state to be listed on the 2014 President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll, the highest federal recognition an institution can receive for its commitment to volunteering, service-learning and civic engagement.
It is the second such recognition for KCC, which also made the Honor Roll in 2013.
More than 760 higher education institutions nationwide were named to this year's list, which is administered by the federal Corporation for National & Community Service to recognize institutions that commit to achieving meaningful, measureable outcomes in the communities they serve. KCC was named as a recipient in the General Community Service category, which recognizes “institutions that have made a commitment to improving the quality of life of off-campus community residents, particularly low-income individuals,” according to the CNCS.
Kate DeGraaf, service learning manager at KCC, said the recognition highlights the College's continued commitment to educating service-minded students who are not only mindful of their communities' needs but are also adequately prepared and equipped to address them as they graduate.
“KCC's service-learning program continues to provide and expand on opportunities for students to engage with and become leaders in their communities,” DeGraaf said. “While the Honor Roll highlight's KCC's role as a service-oriented institution, it also recognizes the commitment, hard work and many hours of dedicated service our students contribute each semester to make their communities better places to live.”
Beginning in 2012, a service-learning endorsement requiring at least 15 hours of service-learning experience became a requirement for every KCC graduate pursuing a degree outside of the applied sciences, and hundreds of KCC students serve thousands of hours in their communities each semester as part of their service-learning studies. The College also hosts several civic engagement and awareness events each year, including three Bruins Give Back volunteer events at locations around Battle Creek and one Volunteer and Civic Engagement Fair held on campus each semester.
This fall, students from one SERV 299 course – a dedicated service-learning course in which students are required to serve at least 100 hours – with students from Albion College and Western Michigan University won a $1,500 grant from Michigan Campus Compact to develop an after-school program for Calhoun Community High School students called B4 the Streetlights. The program will begin this spring.
“KCC is committed to community service and will continue to promote and support activities that encourage our students to participate in and engage with their communities,” said Dr. Dennis Bona, president of KCC. “Service-learning is one of the keys that enriches the education and lives of our Bruins.”
The CNCS has administered the Honor Roll designation since 2006 and manages the program in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, along with the American Council on Education, Campus Compact and the Interfaith Youth Core.

Post-mortem report of a woman, who was found hanging from a tree in Bihar yesterday, has revealed she was not raped. The police say the woman may have committed suicide.The police had yesterday said the 32-year-old victim, who was a passenger of the Delhi-bound Brahmaputra Mail, was dragged to the mango orchard and allegedly gang-raped by unidentified people. The police had found liquor bottles from the spot of the suicide. A railway ticket and cellphone number of her village head written on a piece of paper was recovered from the victim's possession, police said.The victim, who hails from New Jalpaiguri in West Bengal, took the train from Alipore to Delhi, along with her son, according to the police. As the train was crowded, she tried to get down at Sahibganj but was prevented from doing so by co-passengers, Assistant Superintendent of Police, Bhagalpur, Meenu Kumari told PTI. When the train slowed down between Vikramshila and Kahalgaon stations, she jumped out, according to the police.
Image caption PSA tests 'no use alone' in finding prostate cancers
Further concerns have been raised over the reliability of protein testing as an indicator of prostate cancer.
A US study of 5,000 men in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found even a rapid "doubling time" in prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels was not necessarily linked to cancer.
The researchers said a rise was not a cause for concern if a man's PSA was low, and he had no other symptoms.
UK men can request PSA tests, although there is no screening programme.
The National Screening Committee ruled that out because of concerns about over-diagnosis.
Simply having raised PSA is not a clear sign that a man will have cancer.
It could also be an indication that he has another condition, such as a benign prostate condition or a urinary infection.
In addition, a normal PSA result does not guarantee that a man does not have cancer.
Around 35,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year in the UK, and 10,000 die from the disease.
'Stronger evidence'
The researchers from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center gave healthy men aged over 55 annual PSA tests for seven years.
At the end of the study, men not diagnosed with prostate cancer had biopsies.
If a man's PSA has risen rapidly in recent years, there is no cause for concern if his total PSA level is still low Dr Andrew Vickers,, Memorial Sloan-Kettering
The researchers found that basing decisions on biopsies on high PSA velocity - a rapid doubling time in their PSA level (ie from three to six) - would lead to a larger number of procedures, with around one in seven men being biopsied - having a tissue sample removed.
They say that while some cancers would be diagnosed, it would also mean a large number of unnecessary biopsies.
Dr Andrew Vickers, who led the study, said: "If a man's PSA has risen rapidly in recent years, there is no cause for concern if his total PSA level is still low and his clinical examination is normal."
Dr Peter Scardino, chair of the Department of Surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering, who also worked on the research, said: "We have previously published papers determining that PSA naturally varies from month to month and have urged men whose PSA suddenly rises to wait six weeks and repeat the test before agreeing to a needle biopsy.
"This new study in a large population of men provides even stronger evidence that using changes in PSA as a basis for recommendation for biopsy leads to many more unnecessary biopsies and does not help to find the more aggressive cancers that we want to find and treat."
Emma Malcolm, chief executive of the UK charity Prostate Action, said: "This study's findings are consistent with those of a 2009 European study that showed doubling time is not significant for prostate cancer."
She said a family history of prostate or breast cancer could increase a man's risk, as did being of Afro-Caribbean origin, and that those men should have further investigations if they had raised PSA levels.
However Ms Malcolm added that men in their 50s who did not have those risk factors should simply be aware of the symptoms of prostate problems, including having to go to the toilet a lot in the night, not being able to urinate and feeling the need to empty their bladders but being unable to.
If you're anything like me you like to create fine furniture for your home and for your friends using woods like mahogany and walnut but in today's tight economy using luxury woods can really strain one's woodworking budget. When my wife approached me with the idea of building a new suite of furniture for our master bedroom that included a Queen Size bed, dresser w/mirror, chest of drawers, and armoire, I saw my year's woodworking budget going out the door like a runaway train. Enough mahogany or walnut to complete all those pieces was going to cost me mucho dinero but we did need a new bedroom suite. Well I had read on some blog where a woodworker had used dyes to make relatively inexpensive woods imitate the appearance very expensive woods and I decided to experiment with the idea. The results were amazing. I had a hard time telling the difference between dyed Willow and genuine Walnut. I even offer it as an option to my customer's who order custom furniture to save them money.
When I started experimenting with the various wood dyes I needed a good variety of the genuine samples to compare my dyed woods against. Rockler offers a 20 pound box of assorted species of hardwoods that includes Oak, Maple, Birch, Cherry, Walnut and Mahogany for less than $25 plus shipping and handling. I had bought these assortments in the past from Rockler because the pieces were the ideal size for making small projects like jewelry boxes, music boxes, clocks, etc.
There are a wide variety of wood stains available today from many different sources and I experimented with hundreds before settling on a line of dyes produced by W.D.Lockwood. Lockwood dyes are somewhat more expensive than many of the alternatives but the quality results that I achieved using them made the additional cost worthwhile.
I'm going to give you detailed instruction on how to copy several of my relatively inexpensive wood conversions into luxury woods in this tutorial but they are meant as a starting point for your own experimentations. It's a great way to wile away the hours between projects.
Turning Willow into Walnut
Willow lacks the density and durability of genuine Walnut but the heartwood, grain patterns and coloration closely approaches that of Walnut with little or no dying. The less dense Willow soaks up liquid stains several times faster than Walnut so is important to experiment with both species ahead of time with the dyes/stains that you will be using if you intend to mix the two species together in one project. Gel stains produce a less blotchy effect when applied to Willow. I often mix species when making projects like coffee tables, dining room tables, etc because I want the added density and durability of the genuine Walnut for the table tops. Lockwood actually offers nine different Walnut stains so it's easy to match the genuine with the imitation with a little trial and error.
Turning Birch into Maple
Birch lumber and Birch veneered sheet goods is one of the most commonly available materials available at home centers and lumberyards. Birch's creamy colored and dense grain closely approaches that of Maple with little or no staining required. All you need to do is take your genuine Maple sample with you and select those pieces Birch that closely matches it. If you do what to make it an even closer match Lockwood offer nine different Maple stains to help you accomplish that.
Turning Luan veneer plywood into Mahogany veneer plywood
Luan or Philippine mahogany has long been a substitute for the expensive Honduran Mahogany because of its close color and grain pattern. The only thing that sets the two apart is that the Philippine mahogany has a slightly grey cast compared the Honduran Mahogany's reddish cast. I found that using a 50-50 mix of natural antique cherry dye (Lockwood #911) for reddish tones and golden amber maple dye (Lockwood #144) yields a near-perfect color match without highlighting the pores of the wood.
Turning Ash into Oak
Few woods have a grain pattern that matches flat sawn oak but ash comes close. Staining the ash with Minwax red oak (#215) makes the match even closer. The pores of the ash will absorb more pigment from a liquid (not gel) stain than will oak. For an even darker finish, sand ash to 150-grit, leaving a slightly rougher surface where the particles of stain pigment can collect. Use a dye if you want minimal grain contrast.
Turning Maple into Ebony
Maple with it dense grain imitates the exotic, very expensive, Ebony almost perfectly. To make the conversion all you need is India ink. The fine pigments in India ink produce a deep, dark, and consistent black, even on the dense surface of maple. Before coloring the wood, cut and shape parts to size. Then finish-sand all surfaces, taking the end grain to at least 320-grit prior to staining.
Turning Popular into Cherry
Widespread availability and low prices make poplar a prime substitute for more expensive woods. Avoid poplar boards with a greenish cast or strong color contrasts between the heartwood and sapwood. Turning Popular into imitation Cherry is relatively easy with dye. Dye will provide consistent color and, because it's water-based, a damp rag can extract some of the excess if you use too much. (I used Lockwood #911 natural antique cherry dye for this sample.) Allow a little extra shading for the light sanding needed to remove wood fibers raised by water-based dyes. Like cherry, poplar tends to blotch. To make spot adjustments to the color, lightly rub darkened areas with 320-grit sandpaper.
Well this should get you started.
George Zimmerman is in a Florida prison cell awaiting his first appearance before a judge Tuesday near the same courthouse where he was acquitted this summer of murdering Trayvon Martin.

Zimmerman, 30, was arrested today after a "domestic disturbance" with his girlfriend. He now faces a felony charge of aggravated assault and the lesser charges of battery domestic violence and criminal mischief.
Zimmerman's girlfriend, who the Seminole County Sheriff's Office identified as Samantha Scheibe, told a 911 dispatcher that the incident began when the former neighborhood watch captain grew upset during an argument and brandished a weapon at her.
"He's in my house, breaking all my s--- because I asked him to leave," Scheibe told the dispatcher. "He's got a freaking gun breaking all my stuff right now."
Scheibe said Zimmerman then pushed her out the home that they have shared ever since Zimmerman became estranged with his wife and locked her out. Authorities said when they arrived Scheibe gave them keys to the home, and that they had to push through obstacles by the door to get in.
"When we arrived, the victim indicated that she and George Zimmerman were having a verbal dispute and at that time she alleged that he had broken a table and pointed a long-barrel shotgun at her," Seminole County Sheriff's Office Chief Deputy Dennis Lemma said at a news conference.
However, Zimmerman tells a different tale. He told police in a separate 911 call that she instigated the incident.
"My girlfriend has ... for lack of a better word, gone crazy on me," said Zimmerman while police knocked on the door trying to speak with him.
"The police is already there and so why are you calling? What happened?" the dispatcher asked.
Zimmerman replied, "I just want everyone to know the truth."
In Zimmerman's 911 call he says his "pregnant" girlfriend instigated the altercation and that no guns were used. Police later noted that his girlfriend was not pregnant.
"I never pulled a firearm. I never displayed it. When I was packing it I'm sure she saw it. I keep it next to the bed," Zimmerman said.
He said he agreed to leave the house to diffuse a tense conversation, and at first she agreed but then became upset.
"When she changed, she just started smashing stuff. Taking stuff that belonged to me. Throwing it outside. Throwing it out of her room. Throwing it all over the house. She broke a glass table," said Zimmerman.
Zimmerman appeared hesitant to speak with officers who were trying to get in the home.
Dispatcher: Is she still outside with the officers now? Zimmerman: I don't know ma'am. I'm inside. Dispatcher: You're inside? And you're still not willing to go out and speak with the officers? Zimmerman: I can talk to one of the officers. But I don't want to go outside.
Zimmerman asked to speak with an officer on the phone. He was unarmed when police got to him and "rather passive," Lemma said. He offered no resistance and was taken into custody. He is being held without bond and if a judge decides to let him go free, authorities have requested that he once again be outfitted with an electronic monitoring device.
Late Monday night police were seen removing what looked like evidence from the home.
A spokesman for lawyer Mark O'Mara, who represented Zimmerman in the murder trial, noted that O'Mara "is not representing George Zimmerman in today's matter or any new matters, and as such it is not appropriate for him to make any comments."
Monday's incident is Zimmerman's latest run in with the law since his acquittal in Martin's death.
In September, he was released after being arrested without charges after his wife called 911 to say Zimmerman punched his father-in-law in the nose and threatened to shoot him and his wife.
Zimmerman claimed that he was acting in a "defensive manner" during the incident, according to police, who later added that they never found a gun on Zimmerman.
He has also been pulled over for speeding, once in July and once in September. During the July incident, he alerted the officer that he had a gun in his glove compartment.
On July 18, the Seminole County Sheriff's Office said Zimmerman was one of two men who came to the aid of a family who became trapped inside their Ford Explorer after it rolled over on the side of the highway.
By the time police arrived, two people -- including Zimmerman -- helped the family get out of the overturned car, according to the sheriff's office.
Zimmerman became a controversial figure when he shot and killed unarmed black teen Trayvon Martin. He was acquitted of second-degree murder in July.
Zimmerman conceded he shot and killed Martin in Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26, 2012, but maintained he fired in self-defense. His acquittal caused widespread anger.
Though Zimmerman's defense did not invoke the "stand your ground" law, the case sparked a national debate about race and "stand your ground" laws, which exist in at least 22 states. Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, testified on Capitol Hill in October that "stand your ground" laws must be reviewed and amended.
Zimmerman has a concealed carry permit in Florida that was re-instated after the trial, making him legally entitled to transport and possess a weapon in most states.
For many British sports fans success remains a powerful amnesiac. We saw an ample demonstration of that on Sunday as Mo Farah was roared on to victory at the Great North Run and Team Sky steered Chris Froome to a staggering triumph at the Vuelta a España to the delight of the union flag-waving supporters. The exuberant TV coverage barely mentioned that some of those responsible for both men's success are under investigation by anti-doping agencies, either. No one, it seems, wants to pass wind in church.
Froome's performance was particularly remarkable as he became the first cyclist to claim consecutive grand tours in the same year since Marco Pantani's Giro d'Italia-Tour de France double in 1998. At the end of July he had admitted his fourth yellow jersey had been the hardest; yet 27 days later the Team Sky train was back setting a tempo so high it took the breath away not only of their rivals but of spectators too.
Last week Jeremy Whittle, respected author of the classic cycling book Bad Blood, said he had “never seen a collective performance to compare with Sky in La Vuelta - that includes Banesto, Telekom, Mapei, USP” in his 24 years of covering grand tours. And that strength was emphasised on the penultimate stage, up the steepest 24% incline of the Alto de l'Angliru. While the Italian Vincenzo Nibali, who was more rested having missed the Tour, wobbled and then wilted, Froome and his loyal lieutenant Wout Poels made a devastating incline look like a minor inconvenience.
In fairness to Farah he regularly faces questions about his association with his coach Alberto Salazar – whose Nike Oregon Project has been scrutinised by the US Anti-Doping Agency since 2015. He is also regularly pressed on other issues, such as his relationship with the controversial coach Jama Aden and the leak by the Russian hackers, Fancy Bears, which suggested that at least one expert in 2015 thought he was “likely doping” based on his athlete biological passport, a verdict which was reversed six months later. Froome and Team Sky, however, get nowhere near the same level of badgering.
It is hard to work out why, given there are obvious similarities between the two which go beyond their achievements. Both were late developers – Froome won his first grand tour at 28, Farah his first world title at the same age. Both have defied Father Time by producing their best performances in their 30s. And both race for teams who remain under scrutiny by sport's sheriffs.
If anything Froome's transformation from a journeyman on the verge of being released by Team Sky in 2011 into a five-time grand tour winner is far more dramatic than Farah's improvement.
Perhaps the tide is turning. Not so long ago the overwhelming response to Sky's Vuelta success would have been yet more breathless reportage about marginal gains, talent and technology. But does Sir Dave Brailsford's stump speech about finding small improvements in thousands of different areas to beat his rivals still hold, given it is known that Sir Bradley Wiggins was aided in his 2012 Tour de France victory by a therapeutic use exemption certificate for the corticosteroid triamcinolone? This strips fat from the body with no loss of power and the experience of riders who have used triamcinolone suggests that was a massive, not a marginal, gain. It hardly helps either that throughout the claims and counterclaims into what was in the mystery package delivered to Wiggins at the Critérium du Dauphiné in June 2011, Brailsford's behaviour has been confused – to put it kindly.
He wrongly claimed that the British Cycling courier Simon Cope had not travelled to France to deliver that package to Wiggins but to see Emma Pooley – an explanation that quickly unravelled when it was revealed she was competing in Spain at the time. He denied that Wiggins and Dr Richard Freeman had been together on the Team Sky bus at the Dauphiné – video evidence proved they were. He also told parliament that his understanding was that Wiggins's medical records had been made available to UK Anti-Doping, which they had not. And it took weeks for Team Sky to come up with the story that the package for Wiggins contained the legal decongestant Fluimucil. Others close to the investigation, however, remain unconvinced.
If the rap sheet was not damaging enough, Brailsford also tried to persuade the Daily Mail to bury the story because he feared it could mark “the end of Team Sky”, while the head of Ukad, Nicole Sapstead, told parliament that her investigators had met with “resistance” in their inquiries.
True, when it comes to Sky there is no smoking gun. But only the most blind-eyed patriot would deny there is a bonfire's worth of smoke. No wonder their credibility was described as being “in tatters” by Damian Collins MP, the head of the culture, media and sport select committee, barely six months ago. Froome is not accused of any wrongdoing but, like Farah, he risks becoming defined by his associations.
Meanwhile it is worth remembering that when Team Sky launched, Brailsford promised to create a team “in which riders are free of the risks of doping and in which fans – new and old – can believe without any doubt or hesitation”. Despite the greatest season in the team's history, the ambition behind that pledge seems more frayed than ever.

On her wedding day, 15-year-old Nasoin Akhter looked “melancholic,” according to photographer Allison Joyce, who documented the teenage girl's wedding to her 32-year-old husband, Mohammad Hasamur Rahman, last week in Manikganj, Bangladesh.
“It's tradition for the bride to look shy and coy during the wedding,” Joyce told The Washington Post in an e-mail. “But I noticed this sadness and unspoken fear and uncertainty even when she was in her room with her friends before the ceremony or at the parlor with her sister (who was also married around the same age). She was withdrawn and quiet. ”

Although Nasoin Akhter's marriage is technically illegal in Bangladesh, laws against child marriage are rarely enforced. And despite what government officials promise and the fact that outside organizations consider it a human rights violation, the practice remains popular in Bangladesh. According to a report published in June by Human Rights Watch, the country has the fourth-highest rate of child marriage in the world, with 29 percent of Bangladeshi girls married before age 15 and 65 percent before age 18.
“Child marriage around the world is associated with many harmful consequences, including health dangers associated with early pregnancy, lower educational achievement for girls who marry earlier, a higher incidence of spousal violence, and an increased likelihood of poverty,” the report states. “Global data shows that girls from the poorest 20 percent of families are twice as likely to marry before 18 as girls whose families are among the richest 20 percent.”

Poverty, tradition, the sexual harassment of unmarried girls and limited access to education drive the practice, convincing parents that they are doing what's best for their daughters, according to the report.
On Instagram, Joyce wrote that Akhter was the “saddest bride I have ever seen.” And the photographer told The Post what she found surprising about Akhter's wedding was that her family wasn't poor: “What was surprising to me is that Nasoin is from a very wealthy family. One of the causes cited for child marriage is poverty, but her father is a wealthy businessman with multiple two-story houses. Around 2,000 people were invited to the wedding, and they slaughtered hundreds of chickens and a dozen large cows to feed the guests.”

Joyce, who is based in Bangladesh, has photographed other child marriages. Another young bride, 14-year-old Mousammat Akhi Akhter, said she had wanted to wait until she was older before she married 27-year-old Mohammad Sujon Mia but, as Joyce reports, social pressure and tradition persuaded her parents to get her married last year just after she had finished 6th grade.
“Before their weddings they had dreams, they both loved school and had hopes for the future. Akhi's favorite subject was math and she wanted to be a teacher, before she was married off at 13,” Joyce told The Post. “She said that her father supported her education but her mother saw nothing wrong with child marriage as it has been a norm in their village and community and thought it would be best for her. She told me she was frightened, that she wasn't ready to get married.”

Mohammad Sujon Mia, 27, stands beside his wife, 14-year-old Mousammat Akhi Akhter. Joyce said when she asked Sujon why he married someone so much younger, he replied: “I didn't force her to marry me. I don't think about the age difference. She acts like an adult and does her job well around the house.” (Allison Joyce/Getty Images)
But it's not only the desperation of poverty or social pressure that drives child marriage — it's protection.
“I photographed the wedding of Akhi's 13-year-old sister last year, and when I asked her mother why she was marrying her daughter off, she described not feeling comfortable to let her walk to the corner store because she would be harassed by men and boys,” Joyce said. “She also said no boy wants to marry a girl older than 18. If a girl is still single past that age people will ask too many questions. She knew it was wrong to marry very early, but they weren't from a wealthy family, and she told her daughter's husband to wear condoms for a few years, so it will be okay. Marriage is seen as a cover of respect and protection for women. By not going to school, it reduces the risk of being sexually active outside the house or be harassed while commuting.”
Fourteen-year-old Shima Akhter married her 18-year-old husband last year. Shima told Joyce that her parents received a marriage proposal after she had talked to her husband on the phone for only 17 days. “She didn't want to get married just then, she wanted to wait and was afraid of family life and leaving her parents, but her mother said that he was from a good family so they should take the opportunity,” Joyce said. (Allison Joyce/Getty Images)

This is my life now.” (Allison Joyce/Getty Images)
Even though Bangladesh has reduced poverty and maternal mortality, achieved gender parity in primary and secondary school enrollment, and is improving its record on women's rights, it still struggles to tackle child marriage, according to the report. The government's proposed plan to deal with this issue has raised awareness — but one of its strategies was to lower the legal marriage age from 18 to 16. After an international outcry, it was put on hold. On a local level, “widespread complicity” of officials has facilitated many of the child marriages.
“Interviewees consistently described local government officials issuing forged birth certificates showing girls' ages as over 18, in return for bribes of as little as US$1.30,” the report reads.
“The Bangladesh government has said some of the right things, but its proposal to lower the age of marriage for girls sends the opposite message,” Heather Barr, a senior researcher on women's rights at Human Rights Watch. “The government should act before another generation of girls is lost.”
“Working on this issue has been very troubling.” Joyce said. “The only difference between these girls and me is that I happen to have been born into a country and culture that respects girls and women, and sees a woman's value in a society beyond the role of a mother or a wife. Seeing their future, their possibilities and potential being ripped away from these girls in the span of one night is equal parts heartbreaking and infuriating for me. I don't think it will be possible for countries to develop to their full potential until women and men stand on equal footing.”

The ‘self-fulfilling prophesy' of stereotyping Asian American students
Police talk at the scene of an officer-involved shooting in Holladay, Utah, on Jan. 17. (Scott Sommerdorf/The Salt Lake Tribune via AP)
Roughly 200 of the nation's most prominent police chiefs, Justice Department and White House officials, and police training experts convened in Washington on Friday to discuss policy proposals which, if implemented broadly, would amount to the most drastic police reform in decades.
During the forum, titled “Taking Policing to a Higher Standard” and held in the seventh-floor meeting rooms of the Newseum, top officials from many of the nation's largest police departments were urged to implement new training and departmental policies that supporters believe could lead to a decrease in the number of fatal shootings by officers each year — a topic near the top of the national consciousness in the 18 months since the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.
“This is a defining moment for us in policing,” Charles Ramsey, the recently-retired commissioner of the Philadelphia Police Department, told the room. Ramsey, also a former D.C. police chief, was one of several prominent policing officials who said departments must act proactively to change their use-of-force policies instead of waiting for one of their officers to be involved in a controversial shooting.
Privately, several of those in attendance remarked that the shift in attitude of top police officials toward reform seems a direct result of the protests in Ferguson, Baltimore, Chicago and elsewhere and the resulting increase in media scrutiny of police use of force.
“We need to raise the bar for all police departments,” said Chuck Wexler, who runs the Police Executive Research Forum, a policing policy think-tank that organized the gathering.
Accurate national statistics on fatal police shootings were unavailable until last year when The Washington Post launched a database to track them, documenting 987 fatal shootings by on-duty officers in 2015.
[The Washington Post's police shooting project]
Wexler presented The Post's findings to the gathering of officials and said that even after removing all shootings in which the person killed had a gun, there were still hundreds of preventable fatal shootings last year.
“We can impact about 300 of those,” he said.
The goal of reform, organizers said, should be to address the large number of shootings that are “lawful but awful” in that they do not amount to a crime but that they spark community outrage and could have been prevented.
Among reforms discussed at length were retraining all officers in deescalation tactics and abandoning training that teaches the “21-foot-rule” — a turn of phrase taught to nearly all current U.S. police officers that is often interpreted by officers to mean they are justified in shooting any suspect with a knife or edged weapon who comes within 21 feet of them.
“It almost gets to the point that officers are thinking ‘my safety is more important than the safety of anyone else's' ….,” said Tom Manger, chief of police in Montgomery County, Md. “We've got to change the culture of American policing. … Our goal should be to have everyone go home safely at the end of the day.”
[A year of reckoning: Police fatally shoot nearly 1,000]
How any department handles an officer-involved shooting or other use of force incident varies depending on the department's policies, local union contracts and state laws.
In an attempt to address the lack of national standards governing police use of force, Wexler proposed to the chiefs 30 “guiding principles” — which include prioritizing the preservation of human life, adopting deescalation as a formal agency policy, quickly releasing information about any use of force incident, and training officers that it is their duty to intervene to prevent another officer from using excessive force.
“It's important for us to recognize the gap that exists between what is acceptable in community standards of use of force … and what is acceptable under the law,” said Scott Thomson, chief of the Camden County Police Department in New Jersey.
Currently, almost all fatal police shootings, especially those during which the person killed has a weapon, are ruled legally justified, based in part on the 1989 Supreme Court decision that established the “objectively reasonable” standard. It excuses an officer who perceives a threat that any other objectionably reasonable officer would perceive, even if the shooting itself violates policies or protocols or the threat turns out to not exist.
“There is a real mismatch between what community standards are, what the community expects, what they think the law should be, versus what the training and the law allows for,” said Vanita Gupta, Department of Justice's assistant attorney general for civil rights. Gupta said a national conversation about police objective reasonableness was potentially “revolutionary.”
[Creating guardians, calming warriors]
One provision that drew significant discussion and push-back among the chiefs was a policy guideline calling for all police use of force to meet a proportionality standard, which called for officers to consider how the general public might view any use of force in determining whether it is appropriate.
Several of the chiefs noted that they anticipate, or have already seen, significant resistance from their officers and local police unions to an attempt to change policies or to hold officers more accountable. Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn, who said that officers need to be disciplined more consistently for violating policing policy, recalled the anger he provoked with his decision to fire the police officer who shot and killed Dontre Hamilton, a mentally ill man who was asleep on a park bench.
While the shooting was not criminal, Flynn said, the actions of former officer Christopher Manney violated department protocol.
“I made a decision to fire him and announced it at a press conference in which I still defended his use of deadly force at that instant,” Flynn said. “As you can imagine, that decision wasn't meant to please anybody, and succeeded.”
“I had the Coalition for Justice demand my firing, and the police union vote no confidence,” Flynn said, prompting a round of laughter. “And I like to think at that moment I kind of brought the police and community together.”
Others questioned whether departments should train their officers that they are accountable for their behavior above and beyond the “objective reasonableness” standard. Instead, some of the chiefs said, through retraining, the culture of policing could up the standard for what would be deemed “objectionably reasonable.”
“I'm totally in agreement that police don't know how to retreat in the United States and that we kill too many people. There are things that we can do … to reduce the death toll,” said Ed Davis, the former Boston police commissioner. “However, when we get to this point where we start to say that we have to hold ourselves to a higher standard, it's great rhetoric but … it's difficult for an agency to say ‘even though the Supreme Court said this, we're gonna say that.' ”
The group watched a number of videos — taken by bystanders and body cameras — of police shootings that occurred in 2015, as well as other videos of police behavior that went viral, such as the video of an officer breaking up a pool party of teenagers in McKinney, Tex.
“I'm surprised you haven't shown my video yet,” said Daniel Oates, the police chief in Miami Beach, where in December officers killed an alleged bank robber wielding a straight-edge razor in a shooting caught on camera.
Moments later, the chiefs were dissecting the video of the Miami Beach shooting, during which officers surround the man, 51-year-old David Winesett. One officer gets close enough to deploy a stun gun and as he does, another officer opens fire.
“I've learned that South Florida doesn't have the longer, less lethal weapons,” Oates said, adding that he wishes one of the officers responding to the man had had a gun that could fire less lethal ammunition, such as a beanbag. “I'm kicking myself. I had been there 18 months and I hadn't inquired into it. In my last agency we used less lethal shotguns very effectively.”
[Police withhold videos despite vows of transparency]
They also watched videos from Scotland and Northern Ireland, where police kill very few people despite often facing violent threats — in part, the chiefs said, because their officers are trained to back away from potential threats and retreat if necessary.
“In America, police officers do not have an obligation to retreat,” noted William McManus, chief of the San Antonio Police Department. “That is problematic.”
Other chiefs noted that they were initially skeptical of some of the proposed reforms, only to later see their merits after some of the changes were implemented.
Among the suggestions were that departments implement a policy that prohibits officers from shooting into a moving vehicle — a step taken by the New York Police Department in 1972 that drastically cut down on the department's number of fatal shootings.
The Denver Police Department has had several fatal shootings involving people in cars in recent years, including the death of 17-year-old Jessie Hernandez. That prompted Wexler to call the Denver police chief and recommend he research the NYPD's policy.
“I'm saying ‘that's kind of stupid'… is what I said to myself … but at the same time I realized that we needed to do something different,” said R.C. White, Denver's police chief.
After researching the departmental policies of other police units, White chose to craft a new policy banning officers from shooting into a moving vehicle and providing his officers with more training in how to get out of the way of a suspect in a vehicle.
“We ended up changing our policy,” White said.

A Southern California radio tradition of nearly 60 years will resume, as DJ Art Laboe is set to return to the LA radio waves, it was reported Sunday.
Laboe's syndicated oldies show has been picked up by KDAY-FM, and will be heard Sundays from 6 to midnight at 93.5 FM.
The Los Angeles Times reported that the weekly Laboe show will originate from his studio in Palm Springs.
Laboe has been a Los Angeles radio personality since the mid '50s, and worked at an earlier incarnation of KDAY when it was at 1580 on the AM dial. At one time he was selling his compilation 8-track tapes of local rock bands to the entire West Coast on a 50,000-watt “border blaster,” XEPRS (1090) from Rosarito, Mexico.
He is one of the last DJs to take requests and dedications, and has a dedicated audience of doo-wap, '50s rock and “El Monte” sound Latino rock music fans.
The show airs on several stations near state prisons in the San Joaquin Valley, and dedications from spouses to imprisoned mates or parents are frequently aired.

Wine During Prohibition
Written by Jennifer Jordan
Filed Under: Wine History
I turned 21 in 1999, decades after the Roaring Twenties. Because of this, I can honestly say that I don't know what Prohibition feels like. I can only compare it to an empty keg at a raging party or that feeling I got one night of high school when I watched a disgruntled bouncer cut up my beloved fake ID. I, like most of us, became of age in an era when wine was freely flowing, beer was always on tap, and every teenager counted the days until their 21st birthday.
Those who were born at the beginning of the 19th Century, however, weren't so lucky. In an era marked by pandemic flu and a world war, an era where drinking was not only used for pleasure but also used as a much-needed escape from reality, Prohibition entered the picture.
Like an unwelcome patron who pulls up a stool at the local bar, saloon owners and alcohol lovers in America took one look at Prohibition and said, "We don't want any." But, it wasn't the common man's decision and, as beer fell to tears, whiskey winced, and cases of Merlot wined, Prohibition began on January 16th, 1920 when the 18th Amendment took effect, illegalizing the production, transportation, and sale of alcohol.
There were red flags against Prohibition from the start - anything the KKK fervently advocates is probably not the best idea - and Prohibition, in the end, did little more than increase alcohol consumption and pave the way for organized crime. Fourteen years later, in December of 1933, Prohibition was repealed by the 21st Amendment, leaving many Americans to raise their glasses to lawmakers for the first time in over a decade.
The Volstead Act
During Prohibition, wine was treated a little differently than other types of alcohol, it was as if a bottle of Cabernet slipped the government a twenty and winked in a way that meant, "shh...keep a cork on it." This was due to the Volstead Act. Passed in the year before Prohibition began, it gave federal agents the ability to investigate and prosecute anyone caught in violation of Prohibition's liquor laws. However, wines used for sacramental purposes were exempt under this act, allowing wine to slip through the cracks where beer was too thick to seep.
Because of this act, limited amounts of wine were able to be made both at home and in wineries. Yet, those made in wineries were only available for purchase through warehouses owned and monitored by the government. Wine was also only allowed to be purchased for use in religious ceremonies, particularly mass. However, these rules didn't keep wine drinkers from only using wine for legal purposes: a conceptual "wine opener", the Volstead Act provided a window of opportunity; one drinker were quick to go through.
A study performed in 1925, during the heart of Prohibition, found that demand for sacramental wine increased by 800,000 gallons in a two year period. Perhaps this demand was being legitimately made by church goers - Prohibition brought out a religious revival of its own - but it's far more likely that people were purchasing sacramental wine for other uses. Just like the old saying there are no Atheists in a foxhole, there are no Atheists in Prohibition when religious wines are legal.
The Wineries
Even though Prohibition increased the consumption of wine by nearly 100 percent - as illegalizing anything will often do - many wineries were forced to close their doors. For those who didn't make sacramental wines, it was hard to get around the law and the grapes of wrath set in like no other time in history. Because of this, prohibition drastically changed the grape industry, placing grapes everywhere out of a job. The wineries that survived this era did so in part by transforming their grapes from wine-making grapes to grapes that served non-alcoholic purposes, such as Concord grapes used to make raisins, grape juice, and jam.
The grape industry of California, in particular, was saved by the Volstead Act, which allowed fermented fruit juices to be produced at home, giving wineries a reason to stay open. While this was intended to save the vinegar industry for American farmers, it also gave California wineries a way to break Prohibition rules. Those manning the wineries began producing a grape jelly called "Vine-go," a jelly that, with the addition of water, would ferment into strong wine in roughly two months.
The Wine Itself
As Prohibition swept the nation, and people everywhere began making beer, whiskey, and wine in their houses, the quality of liquor greatly suffered. Novices of brewing and mixing suddenly were forced into expert status. While some people made liquor that was so strong it left people permanently blind or paralyzed, wine wasn't quite as dangerous.
While wine didn't take away a person's ability to walk or ability to see, it did take away some people's ability to truly appreciate fine wine. This was because, during this era, fine wine wasn't so fine after all.
Having built an elegant reputation that went back to Biblical times, Prohibition made wine a little less sophisticated and a little more spontaneous. While previously produced by people renown for viniculture knowledge, wine during Prohibition was often made by people who knew nothing about wine, other than that they wanted to drink it. This, naturally, resulted in wines of inferior taste: it wasn't the taste, after all, that many homemade winemakers were pursuing.
As Prohibition drew to a close, wineries that had stockpiled wine over the previous fourteen years were able to quench the thirst of some of the parched nation. However, since so many wineries had closed down and others had converted from wine-making grapes to other types of grapes, the wine industry took years to rebound. During this time of recovery, wines were continually made with less quality, hindering people from planting more vineyards.
For a while after Prohibition, it looked like the wine industry was on its way down the drain. But, as wineries began transforming back to growers of wine-making grapes, the quality of wine was eventually restored. Within a few years, the wine industry was on the upslope, and Americans were savoring each and every glass, probably now more than ever.
Having come over from the Kansas City Chiefs, there are many Indianapolis Colts fans now wondering whether new general manager Chris Ballard will look to bring two of his former players along with him–namely safety Eric Berry and nose tackle Dontari Poe, who are set to become free agents.
Both star defensive players were named in our ‘Way Too Early Top 5 Free Agents‘ for the Colts to consider earlier this offseason.
Armed with around $50M of cap space–including additional cap space available with the release of high-priced veterans such as Art Jones ($5.15M) and D'Qwell Jackson ($5.5M), the Colts could potentially be major players in this year's upcoming free agency.

From the sound of things, Ballard's Colts won't be confused with the ‘New York Yankees' anytime soon in free agency (nor should they be), as the new general manager alluded to his philosophy:
“Now saying that, between street free agents, between waiver claims, we'll get into free agency a little bit, but you can't buy a locker room,” said Ballard during Monday's introduction press conference. “You have to be very careful when you enter into free agency, but we're going to try to acquire as many young players that we can to field a competitive roster.”
At the same time; however, Ballard could potentially make a big strike or two in free agency with some of his former Chiefs players, Berry and Poe, being the targets.
According to OverTheCap.com, the Chiefs are projected to have only $4.1M of cap space. However, the team can save around $17M of cap space by releasing veteran backup quarterback Nick Foles ($10.75M) and running back Jamaal Charles ($6.18M)–the former which seems like a given.
That's enough cap space to probably re-sign one of Berry and Poe, with the safe assumption being re-signing Berry if push comes to shove between its two young star defensive players.
Regarding the 28 year old safety, Berry finished this past season with 77 total tackles, a forced fumble, and 4 interceptions–making all 16 starts.
As a result of his once again exceptional play, the former 5th overall pick of the 2010 NFL Draft was named a 1st-Team All Pro (3rd time) and to the Pro Bowl (5th time) respectively.

Not to mention, Berry was the NFL Comeback Player of the Year in 2015, having successfully overcome Hodgkin's Lymphoma–and already has a lifelong fan in Colts head coach Chuck Pagano because of it.
It's not as though Berry simply lives off past reputation either, as per Pro Football Focus (subscription), he was rated as their 8th best safety overall with a +87.6 grade.
However, getting Berry out of Kansas City could be easier said than done (and it's not just because of their world-class barbecue), as the 7-year veteran is the ‘heart and soul' of the Chiefs vaunted defense and wants to re-sign with the only team he's ever known.
Potentially working for the Colts, as well as other free agent suitors' favor, is that Berry already played under the Chiefs franchise tag at $10.8M last season.
Meaning that if the Chiefs and Berry cannot work out a deal this offseason, Kansas City will be forced to apply the franchise tag which will effectively make him the league's highest paid safety at $13M. Complicating matters further for Kansas City is that Berry says he won't play in 2017 under the franchise tag–although he wants to remain with the Chiefs as mentioned.
It still likely means that Berry is a Chief for at least 2017, but applying the franchise tag for a third straight season after that may be impossible given Kansas City's salary cap restraints soon thereafter–if a long-term deal cannot be reached.

Realistically, it means that Berry will not be a member of the Colts–at least not in 2017. However, it's fun to dream about one of the best ballhawk safeties in the league re-energizing this Colts defense and finally providing a much-needed superstar again.
Giving the Colts a star presence at safety that the team has not seen since former Defensive Player of the Year Bob Sanders once infamously roamed sideline-to-sideline (although unheralded safety Antoine Bethea was also very good in his own right).
The Colts need to get more dynamic in their secondary by getting younger, faster, and more athletic–yet productive, and Berry provides all three as a superstar safety.
The more likely free agent signing for the Colts could be Chiefs nose tackle Dontari Poe, who is a ‘monster in the middle' for Kansas City's defense at times.

Starting in all 16 games for the Chiefs last season, the 26 year old nose tackle recorded 27 tackles, 1.5 sacks, and a forced fumble–although basis stats aren't a clear indicator of how productive a nose tackle really is, whose primary job is to draw a double team of blocks.
The 6'3″, 346 pound nose tackle would provide a much-needed interior presence and upgrade to incumbent starter David Parry–who's much better suited long-term as a rotational defensive lineman:
“Look, in this league you win upfront,” added Colts general manager Chris Ballard on Monday. “You win on the o-line, d-line, and if you're not good upfront, it's very difficult when you get into December football. December, January football.”
It's worth noting that nearly every historically great 3-4 defense, whether it be with the New England Patriots Vince Wilfork (or Ted Washington), San Diego Chargers Jamal Williams, or Pittsburgh Steelers Casey Hampton, have all had dominant nose tackles.
That being said, despite his massive size, surprising quickness, and agility, the 2x Pro Bowler doesn't always play up to his immense physical potential on a consistent basis, so there's some ‘buyer beware' here (even if he can throw a mean touchdown pass).
Per Pro Football Focus, Poe received just a +59.8 grade overall this past season, which was only the 59th best among all ‘interior defenders'–including a +46.7 run defense grade.
Nevertheless, he's just one year removed from earning a Top 12 run defense grade among all defensive tackles–meaning there's some definite potential for dominance here.

However, if Poe wants to command a similar mega-contract to what New York Giants nose tackle Damon Harrison recently signed at 5-years, $46.5M last offseason, he may fall short because he simply hasn't consistently brought it as a run-stuffer–which should be his calling card.
That begin said, still only 26 years old and as a former 2012 first round pick, my guess is that some NFL suitor will pay Poe more than his actual consistent production indicates because of his immense physical potential–flashing interior dominance at times.
Whether such a suitor will ultimately be the Colts remains to be seen, but the hiring of Ballard certainly adds speculation to the possibility of bringing either Poe or Berry to Indianapolis.
The impact on women was the most dramatic. Young women living in areas with the greatest inequality were 15 to 27 percent less likely to marry before having a child than women in areas with lower inequality. They also found that in areas where men outnumber women, a woman is more likely to get married before having a child. The reasoning for this has more to do with money than love. “This is consistent with the idea that when women are in short supply, they can bargain more effectively for marriage or a partnership prior to childbirth,” the authors write.
The study also found a correlation between an area's high unemployment rates and a greater likelihood that a man would have a child out of wedlock. For both men and women, the larger the availability of medium-skilled jobs, the more likely they were to marry before having their first child. Why exactly, does the economy play a role in marriage decisions? The researchers give this explanation: Men without well-paying jobs are not seen as marriage material. “These men would be less desirable as marriage partners because of their reduced earning potential,” writes Cherlin, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins and the main author of the study.
He argues that a college degree seems to be a good indicator of the choices millennials will make about getting married or starting a family. His previous research shows that millennials without college degrees are now more likely to have a child without getting married first. Among parents aged 26 to 31 who didn't graduate from college, 74 percent of the mothers and 70 percent of the fathers had at least one child outside of marriage, Cherlin found.
“The lofty place that marriage once held among the markers of adulthood is in serious question among early adults,” he writes.
Both the new study and Cherlin's earlier work focuses on millennials without college degrees, since they are more likely to have a child by now. This means college-educated millennials were underrepresented in the research. But Cherlin says his research shows the importance of strengthening middle-market jobs and training young adults for them, arguing that doing so would increase family stability.
“We'd have a larger percentage of children born to married couples, who tend to stay together longer than do cohabit couples,” says Cherlin, via email. “So improving job opportunities for high school graduates, something we'd like to do anyway, would benefit the family lives of young adults and their children.”
In the meantime, it looks like going to college, or at least moving to areas with less inequality, may also improve a person's chances of getting married before starting a family. And this, Cherlin says, is what most young people still want anyway.

Boston Red Sox outfielder Yoenis Cespedes has switched agencies.
Cespedes joined Jay-Z's Roc Nation Sports, the agency announced Monday via Twitter. The Cuban slugger previously had been represented by Adam Katz of Wasserman Media Group. [tweet https://twitter.com/RocNation/status/524239952947589120 align='center']
Cespedes, who was traded from the Oakland Athletics to the Red Sox right before this year's Major League Baseball non-waiver trade deadline, earned his first All-Star selection in 2014. He hit .260 with 22 homers and 100 RBIs in 152 games split between Boston and Oakland.
Cespedes, who signed a four-year, $36 million contract with the A's before the 2012 season upon defecting from Cuba, is slated to make $10.5 million in 2015. The 29-year-old said last month he wasn't sure whether he'd pursue an extension with the Red Sox or opt for free agency following the 2015 campaign.
Fellow Red Sox outfielder Rusney Castillo, New York Yankees second baseman Robinson Cano, Oklahoma City Thunder forward Kevin Durant and New York Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz are among the other athletes represented by Roc Nation Sports.

Everybody loves crispy on the outside-soft on the inside french fries. By slicing the potato very thin, and soaking them in water before frying, you get just that. Just a pinch of salt is all they need, and you'll be hooked.
Ingredients:
2 Russet or Yellow Flesh Potatoes 2 Cups Vegetable Oil Salt (for seasoning) Step-by-Step Instructions:
Heat 2 cups of vegetable oil in a wok or large pot over medium high heat. Wash and slice the russet potatoes into thin slices (about 1/4 of an inch thick). Place the sliced potatoes in a bowl of water while continuing to slice up the the rest of the potatoes. Once done, rinse potatoes 3 times in cold water. Lay sliced potatoes on paper towel and pat until dry. The drier your potatoes, the crispier they will be. Once your potatoes are dry and your oil is hot (about 375 degrees on a candy thermometer) put 1/3rd of the potato slices in the hot oil. Stir every so often, cooking until browned and crisp on the outside (roughly 8-10 minutes). Remove from hot oil with tongs and place on paper towel. Sprinkle with salt and fold up paper towel around the french fries. Shake the fries in the paper towel to remove excess oil and distribute the salt. To keep warm while making the other 2 batches of french fries, simply lay the french fries on a cookie sheet and place in an oven preheated to 325 degrees. Serve with ketchup or garlic mayonnaise (mayonnaise mixed with 1 tsp mustard, 1 tsp chopped garlic, 1 tsp lemon juice, and 1/2 tsp of salt and pepper). Enjoy!

Yesterday, Donald Trump sent fingers a'wagging and tongues a'clucking by praising Saddam Hussein: “He was a bad guy—really bad guy. But you know what? He did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn't read them the rights. They didn't talk. They were terrorists. Over. Today, Iraq is Harvard for terrorism,” he said. Ad Policy
“The Clinton campaign jumped on the remarks,” CNN reported, “with senior campaign adviser Jake Sullivan saying ‘Trump's praise for brutal strongmen seemingly knows no bounds.'”
How much longer can such faux outrage be maintained? By this point, is it really necessary to, yet again, trot out FDR's applause for, say, the Dominican Republic's Rafael Trujillo, responsible for, among other atrocities, the 1937 massacre that slaughtered over 10,000 Haitians? Roosevelt called Trujillo his “great and good friend.” “He might be a S.O.B, but he is our S.O.B,” Roosevelt reportedly said, not just of Trujillo but of any number of Latin American slaughterers. Does the pundit class really need to be reminded that US presidents have long been rapturous in their acclaim of Latin American dictators, including the Somozas in Nicaragua, Stroessner in Paraguay, Pinochet in Chile, Efraín Ríos Montt in Guatemala? The list knows no bounds.
Today, it would hard to find a top-tier Democrat—Barack Obama, John Kerry, Bill and Hillary Clinton—any less effusive in their praise of Saudi Arabia's leadership, or any other Middle East ally, provided that they are on our side. Clark Mindock writes:
While secretary of state in 2009, Clinton praised Egypt's then-dictator Hosni Mubarak, telling ABC News she considered the president “and Mrs. Mubarak to be friends of my family.” Last year, following the death of Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, the Clintons released a statement through their foundation saying that they were “grateful” for the king's efforts to bring peace to the Middle East, the close economic cooperation between Saudi Arabia and the U.S., and the “kingdom's humanitarian efforts around the world.” On Syrian President Bashar Assad, the Intercept notes that the Democratic front-runner suggested in 2011, as the revolt against him began, that he had the potential “a reformer.”(She was referring to the thoughts of members of Congress who had been to Syria, though she was not challenging their assessment.) Clinton also praised Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, who she said appeared to be a pragmatic leader and a natural politician.
Another of Hillary Clinton's pragmatic allies is Álvaro Uribe, who, funded by Bill Clinton's Plan Colombia, presided over the paramilitarization of state and society in Colombia. Clinton, whose entanglements with Uribe are deep, considers the former Colombia president a friend. The US embassy in Colombia, in 2010, had to caution her not to be too gushing in her praise of Uribe. The US ambassador sent an e-mail advising that:
While in Colombia, the most important thing the Secretary can do is avoid effusive praise for President Alvaro Uribe, who leaves office in August,” the email told Clinton. The former ambassador told Clinton that “it is important to recognize” that “the Colombian president has been a solid backer of U.S. policy and U.S. interests in the region, and has achieved some important improvements in the country's security situation.” However, the email advised, this recognition should avoid “repeating the tone of Defense Secretary [Robert] Gates' April visit. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS
During that trip, Gates called Uribe a “great hero.” It is difficult to convey to US readers the degree of misery Uribe imposed on Colombia, using the power of the state to execute a massive program of land dispossession on behalf of his death-squad social base, largely funded, bipartisanly, by Washington. Clinton, fully briefed on the atrocities Uribe carried out, described him in her book Hard Choices much as Trump describes Hussein, as a “hard-nosed, hands-on leader.”
Ronald Reagan, who led the larger New Right project of re-sanctifying US foreign policy after its Vietnam disaccreditation, felt compelled to drape his support for Central American death squads in the rhetoric of American exceptionalism. The Contras in Nicaragua were the “moral equivalent of the Founding Fathers.” Guatemala's génocidaire-in-chief, Ríos Montt, was “a man of great integrity” and “totally dedicated to democracy.”
But it's Trump's praise of similar hard-nosed, hands-on men that “earns bipartisan scorn,” Politico tells us. Trump's real sin is that he strips US foreign policy down to its brutal base logic. He doesn't moralize the monstrosity.
You're at the gym for a weightlifting session. But something feels off.
You're not a beginner and want to get your workout in for the day, but your body isn't responding positively to the movement.
Or you're an experienced runner, and your body can't keep up with the pace at which you started while on a training run. You want to achieve a high level of exertion and are unsure how fast or slow you should go.
How do you make sense of what your body is telling you?
Autoregulation can help.
Writer and coach Nia Shanks (niashanks.com) said by email that autoregulation “is listening to your body and adjusting accordingly on any given training day.
“Feel amazing? Take advantage. Feeling weak? Do what you can but don't push too hard, and come back stronger next time. A certain exercise not feeling good? Swap it out for a different one,” Shanks wrote.
Autoregulation can mean different things to different people. However, methods such as biofeedback and rates of perceived exertion (RPE) are effective ways to quantify your body's response for consistency, regardless of how you're working out.
[How to build an injury-free worko ut routine]
Biofeedback
Biofeedback measures the body's functions in order to control how it responds to stimuli. Doctors, for example, use biofeedback therapy in alleviating anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder.
With athletic training, biofeedback tests how the body responds to exercise movements. David Dellanave, a trainer and owner of the Movement Minneapolis gym , said the point of exercise is to create a net effect on your body, but not all effects are the same. Doing an exercise may have a positive effect one day but a negative effect the next.
“The goal with biofeedback is to quantify what that effect is in real time and make decisions based on it,” Dellanave said. “So you can pick, how does a squat affect me today? Is it good or is it bad? If it's bad, what can I do that will give me a good response?”
Several biofeedback tests are effective for athletes, such as heart-rate variability (HRV), which measures the intervals between heartbeats. HRV testing is good for runners who want to autoregulate their training runs.
For strength training, Dellanave uses a range of motion tests, such as grip strength and toe touch. The toe-touch test is simple to do. First, before starting your workout, bend at the waist and try to touch your toes. Stop at the first point of tension, which becomes your base for the day. The idea is to gauge what your fullest range of motion will be for the day, not to test your flexibility.
Then, perform the movement you want to do without weights. So, if you are deadlifting, perform a traditional deadlift. After one to two lifts, bend and stretch again. If you were able to get more range than at your first touch, your body responded positively to the traditional deadlift. If not, practice another deadlift, such as the sumo or Jefferson. Then test again. Keep testing until you get a clear sense of what exercise your body will most respond to during that workout.
Stephanie Fowler Shaklee, a teacher and coach from Oklahoma, learned biofeedback from Dellanave's wife, Jen Sinkler, but didn't incorporate it into her routine until she started a new training program.
“The program called for a conventional deadlift, and that version wasn't gelling for me,” Shaklee wrote via email. “Out of the blue, I began to throw in some biofeedback, and I navigated my deadlifts with the ‘answer' that my body gave to me. Biofeedback allowed me to perform the specific lift, but with a slightly different movement variation.”
Shaklee now regularly uses biofeedback and said she has not experienced pain from lifting and doesn't feel as if she's forcing her training.
“We all, as a whole, tend to follow the rules and push through pain in a valiant effort to follow a specific training program. But once we truly solicit feedback from our body, biofeedback can be an additional resource that we can use to tune in to how our body is operating or feeling in the moment,” Shaklee said.
Rate of perceived exertion
The Borg scale, invented by Gunnar Borg, helps rate the level of intensity for a physical activity, or perceived exertion. The RPE scale quantifies how one felt instead of whether an exercise was easy or hard.
If you go to a gym class, odds are you already use a variation of the Borg scale when the instructor asks for a “7” effort on a 1-10 scale.
Michael Tuchscherer, the founder of Reactive Training Systems and a gold medalist in powerlifting at the 2009 World Games, said via email that RPE helps rate the athlete's overall performance instead of one's emotions.
“The biggest thing is to have a system in place that helps you value your body's feedback but not overvalue your emotions of the moment,” Tuchscherer said. “If you ignore your body's feedback, then you miss out on one of the most critical tools to long-term success. If you misunderstand or misrepresent your body's feedback as emotions, then you also miss out on the work that is required to see major improvements.”
Tuchscherer teaches his strength-training clients to use a 6-10 RPE scale. A 6 RPE is the equivalent of a fast bar speed while lifting with moderate effort, and a 10 RPE is maximum effort. Tuchscherer says the scale focuses on performance while one is doing a set and not just the weight lifted.
Kristine Becker, a trainer from Minneapolis, teaches RPE to her clients and uses it in her own training. She wrote via email that training with RPE is useful in her trail-running efforts, where measuring consistent pace is much harder to do than on roads. Becker wrote that RPE training gives her confidence that her overall effort is what she wants it to be, regardless of training conditions.
“If I haven't gotten a lot of sleep or am stressed about other things, a 7/10 might result in a different pace, distance or volume of weight lifted, but it's still my 7/10 for that day,” Becker said. “Using RPE helps me focus on doing what I can with what I have where I am, which keeps me on track and not constricted by the bounds of objective data, which may be harder to hit on rough days.”
Incorporating biofeedback and RPE takes practice. Shanks recommends that trainees follow their program for about six months, noting how they're feeling in relation to their workouts. Once trainees understand how their body responds, autoregulation will be effective in optimal training.
“Like anything else, listening to your body takes practice, but it's worth the effort,” Shanks said.

The husband-and-wife terrorists who slaughtered 14 innocent people in California polished their shooting skills at local gun ranges just days before the attack, officials said Monday.
“We do have evidence that both of these subjects […] participated in target practice in some ranges within the metro area or within the Los Angeles area,” said David Bowdich, the FBI's assistant director in Los Angeles.
“That target practice in one occasion was done within days of this event.”
Syed Rizwan Farook spent several hours at the Riverside Magnum Shooting range on Nov. 29 and Nov. 30, practicing with his own AR-15 assault rifle and handgun — the same type of weapons used during the Wednesdaymassacre, a federal law enforcement source said.
Investigators also believe that Farook and his jihadi wife, Tashfeen Malik, had been “dry-firing” — pulling the trigger of an unloaded gun — in the backyard of a Southern California home as they prepared for the terror spree, the source said.
Meanwhile, federal sources said that all of Farook's family members and friends are being looked at as the terror investigation continues.
“The mom definitely has exposure as a potential co-conspirator,” a federal source said.
“We are trying to uncover any evidence of her possible involvement which could lead to charges.”
Bowdich said that both Malik and Farook were “radicalized,” adding that they “have been for quite some time.”
Naomi Campbell will not go deprived…
It must have been a challenge at first, but figuring out what to get the girl who already has it all for her 41st birthday suddenly became quite apparent for billionaire real estate developer Vladislav Doronin when he decided what Naomi needed next was her own paradise island home, in the shape of the eye of Horus. More breath taking revelations have hardly ever existed…
The unique palazzo (can one use a more fitting description?) is the brainchild of architect Luis de Garrido, which is set to built on the exclusive (naturally…) island of Sedir off Turkey.
For those curious as to the actual constructs of the home, there's this:
Plans of the building reportedly show that the ‘eyeliner' portions of the property consist of solar panels to power Naomi's home.
Water would be pumped through hot volcanic rock via a state-of-the-art geothermal system to heat it, and sewage is to be treated on-site.
The eye's ‘pupil' is said to be the main three-storey house, including five reception rooms and an indoor garden. It has been designed as a glass-covered dome.
Although the greenhouse effect promotes natural heating, certain measures – such as landscaping and tilted louvers – will apparently ensure that the heat is bearable during the summer time. It will also have plenty of ventilation.
Of course what goes without saying is that there will be additional space for Vlad's yacht. Or should we say yachts?
What is said to make the island unique is its history. Legend has it that the Roman emperor Mark Anthony had its pristine beaches built there specifically for his love at the time, Cleopatra. Which should explain almost immediately the desire of our Vlad (who coincidentally has the awkward problem of still being married to another woman, oh well…) to construct an equally beguiling experience for his trophy thing queen, in the shape and symbol of the Egyptian god of power and good health, Horus.
Don't you wish you were in the position to create something as equally enchanting as what our Vlad has in store for his supermodel girlfriend? Of course failing that there's one's imagination or the winter specials to Cancun, Mexico…

Twice a week since mid-July, the Senate has been going through the motions of gaveling into session, reading a brief announcement setting the date for the next meeting and then shutting down the floor.
It takes only a single lawmaker a mere 30 seconds, yet each of those brief meetings does just a little bit more to dash President Obama's hopes of seating Judge Merrick Garland on the Supreme Court.
“This will ensure there's no recess appointment of the president's nominee,” said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican. “The Supreme Court has our back on that one.”
Mr. Obama nominated Judge Garland on March 16 to fill the seat left vacant in February by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. But more than five months later, the Senate has not acted on the nomination. Republicans who control Congress insist that voters should have a say in the pick, based on whom they elect in November.
Most Supreme Court vacancies are filled in a matter of weeks, and just two vacancies since 1900 have lasted as long as the Scalia seat, which will have been empty for more than 200 days by the time Congress returns from a seven-week recess on Sept. 6.
In the past, the president could have used that time to flex his recess appointment powers, granted in Article I of the Constitution, which allow him to fill posts when Congress is out of session.
But the pro forma sessions — the next is slated for Tuesday morning with another to follow Friday — are enough to stop him.
It's a tactic Democrats know well, having made extensive use of it when they controlled the Senate in 2007 and 2008, denying President George W. Bush his chance to make recess appointments.
Sen. Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who crafted the strategy against the Republican president, is now on the other end, hoping to at least find a way to force a floor vote on Judge Garland.
“There are some extreme procedures we can use,” Mr. Reid told reporters this month.
He said he hopes Republicans who are eager to distance themselves from their party's presidential nominee, Donald Trump, will jump at the chance to confirm Judge Garland.
“If they want to separate themselves from Donald Trump, and heaven knows they should, what they should do is call in McConnell to confirm Garland,” Mr. Reid said.
Short of that, the best Mr. Reid can hope for is that voters punish Senate Republicans at the ballot box in November. But he and his fellow Democrats squandered their best chance to make it a major political issue. Not one of the major speakers at the Democratic National Convention last month mentioned Judge Garland.
Mark Strand, president of the Congressional Institute, which studies Congress and its powers, said as long as at least one chamber is held by the opposition party, it's unlikely there will be another recess appointment.
Mr. Obama tried to test that strategy in 2012 by announcing a series of recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board, even when the Senate was meeting every three days. A company sued, and the case made its way to the Supreme Court, which in a 9-0 spanking ruled Mr. Obama out of order.
“By forcing the issue, he ended up undermining the executive's ability to make traditional recess appointments,” Mr. Strand said.
The pro forma sessions are strikingly lackadaisical, particularly for a chamber that is usually strict and scripted.
One August morning, just a few moments before the session was to begin, several large bookcases were strewn across the back of the chamber, where they had been laid while one of the cloakrooms was getting a makeover. A group of workers rushed into the chamber and carried the bookcases out just in time for the session to begin.
The sessions are almost always hosted by junior Republicans, and not all of them make it on time. Sen. Tim Scott, South Carolina Republican, rolled into the chamber three minutes after the scheduled starting time for his session earlier this month. Last week, Sen. Rand Paul was 18 minutes late.
In the meantime, Judge Garland's nomination remains in limbo. He has gone through all of the procedural hoops he can on his own, including meeting one-on-one with senators and filling out the standard nominee questionnaire probing his schooling, his career, his volunteer commitments and his extensive legal record.
He also has recused himself from hearing cases at the federal appeals court in Washington to avoid poisoning those proceedings — or his own chance at the high court.

What's a year or two between friends? Quite a lot, it seems – and even longer between sworn political enemies. Theresa May got her own back on the first minister of Scotland by refusing her request for a second independence referendum before Brexit negotiations are complete. That position sounds kinda reasonable – until you think it through.
Independence is Scotland's choice. May should let them get on with it | Simon Jenkins Read more
By the time Brexit is signed, sealed and delivered, Scotland will be outside Europe having to fight its way back in. That's not what 62% of Scots wanted when they voted to remain in June 2016.
Now though it clearly wouldn't matter if continuing EU membership got 100% backing north of the border. The Scottish parliament – touted by Westminster as the most powerfully devolved in the world – must still meekly ask permission for a second referendum from a prime minister whose party has fewer MPs in Scotland than there are pandas in Edinburgh zoo.
Only in centralised Britain could that seem like anything but a democratic nonsense. It's clear the prime minister has roundly and contemptuously rejected every attempt by the Scottish government to achieve a differentiated settlement within the UK. Nicola Sturgeon delivered an options papers in December and has yet to receive the courtesy of a formal reply. So it was predictable the Scottish first minister would finally break ranks and decide she and Holyrood had been snubbed one time too many – and equally predictable that this prime minister would play hardball and throw Sturgeon's request straight back in her face.
So who will blink first? And whose suggested timing makes most sense? The Scottish first minister wants another referendum on independence between autumn 2018 and spring 2019 in the belief that if Scots vote yes before the end of Brexit negotiations, Scotland could remain in the EU and avoid most of the great reform bill chaos which will soon gum up the works in Westminster. A pre-Brexit settlement of the Scottish independence question would also protect EU nationals living north of the border if – as expected – May doesn't get round to that basic act of enlightened self-interest fast.
Plus, the 2018-19 timescale fits the prime minister's own negotiating timetable – unless hard Brexiters within her cabinet crash the UK out of talks without any deal in the next few months.
The main thing Scots need to know is whether Britain will still be in the single market, and it's already pretty obvious we won't. All that remains to be seen on the UK side of the argument is whether substantial new deals can mitigate that monumental economic mistake. May's sweetheart deal with Donald Trump may excite some south of the border – particularly those who want to complete her government's destruction of the English NHS by opening everything to competition from American companies – but good luck selling that as a booby prize to Scots whose NHS, schools and prisons are in nothing like the constant crisis overseen by the Westminster government.
So what happens next? An unofficial poll? I dinnae think so. A climbdown by Sturgeon to accept a 2020 or 2021 poll just before the next Holyrood elections? I dinnae think so either.
The Scottish first minister will keep jumping through the parliamentary and legal hoops to reach the starting line for indyref2 in the hope and expectation that every false move made by May will add to the clamour for another way out for Scotland. As Sturgeon put it: “The prime minister is intent on sinking the boat – now she's slashing the lifeboats to make sure the Scots can't escape the fate she has visited upon the UK.”
There's been no campaigning yet to demonstrate why an alternative to crashing out of Europe is worthwhile
Meanwhile, the prime minister is placing all her faith in polls that suggest most Scots don't want a second indyref – and she's probably right. At the moment, only the committed yes supporters could handle the instability of another referendum heaped on the uncertainty of Brexit. But there's been no campaigning yet to demonstrate why an alternative to crashing out of Europe is worthwhile. There's been no attempt yet to translate the obscure worry about trade in the EU into more tangible things such as job security.
If a motorway is about to be built through your house you must begin efforts to find a new home – before a single bulldozer appears. With few tangible economic downsides to Brexit yet, it's no surprise many Scots still hope they can stick their collective heads in a bunker and come out again in five years when the mess has been tidied up and life has returned to normal. But guaranteed economic safety isn't round the corner with either solution – it depends on how long it takes before Brexit starts to bite.
So will May's negotiations with Europe be sufficiently public, painful, and unpleasant to act as a recruiting sergeant for Scottish independence? Former Better Together activist John McKee thinks they will. He writes: “Sturgeon has shown herself adept at exploiting minor knife-like grievances, like devolution of agriculture powers from the EU, but this hands her a claymore … Worst of all about the formulation May chose, is that it is completely unsustainable. ‘Now is not the time' will only begin the furious and ultimately irresistible demands for May to say when is the time?” That's a very good question. The arm-wrestling contest between May and Sturgeon has started – but it's nowhere near over.
Americans, Need Help in Syria? Call the Czechs.
U.S. efforts to craft some sort of Syria policy have meant dealing with a roster of well-known countries: Syria, of course, Russia, Turkey, Iran, and more. But there's one more for that list: the Czech Republic.
Since 2012, the skeleton-staffed Czech Embassy in embattled Damascus has been acting as a protecting power for the mighty United States, the same way that Sweden does in North Korea and Switzerland in Iran (both Sweden and Switzerland do the same for other countries). It is a reflection of the small European country's ability to juggle both continued access to the Assad regime and warm ties with Washington.
That diplomatic reach is a reflection, in part, of decades-old ties between what used to be Czechoslovakia and the regime of Bashar al-Assad's father.
Czechoslovakia — which, granted, was a different country and a different, communist regime — was a major economic partner of and arms exporter to Syria for decades, before and during the Assad years. Trade increased fivefold just between 1952 and 1956, and continued for decades, anchored by visits to Czechoslovakia by Hafez al-Assad, despite tumult in both countries. This continued even after the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc: In 1991, Prague was still greenlighting the the export of tanks to Syria.
After the end of communism, and especially once the Czechs joined the European Union in 2004, its policy toward Syria moved more in line with that of Brussels — but Prague never abandoned Damascus entirely.
“The policy [toward Syria] changed considerably after the fall of communism in 1989. Since then, Israel became our key ally in the region. At the same time, we kept our traditionally good relations with the Arab countries, including Syria,” a diplomat with the Czech Embassy in Washington, D.C. told Foreign Policy.
Even as practically every other western embassy in Damascus shuttered its doors, the Czechs decided to stay in town — in part to act as a protecting power for the United States. “We believe that the Syrian conflict does not have a military solution, but only a political one,” the Czech diplomat said.
Holding down the fort for the United States is Eva Filipi, the only European ambassador physically left in Damascus. Filipi, at about 70 years old and sporting a blonde, banged bob has worked as journalist, a translator, an interpreter, the chargé d'affaires for the Czech Embassy in Iraq, the ambassador to Lebanon, and the ambassador to Turkey. At present, however, she is hunkered down in Damascus.
But how did the United States come to ask the Czechs, with their colorful Syrian backstory, in the first place?
As the Syrian civil war ramped up in 2011, the United States decided to withdraw its diplomats for their safety; then-U.S. ambassador Robert Ford was attacked in his car by a pro-regime mob in September of that year. By early 2012, the United States had decided to shutter its embassy in Damascus altogether. That meant it would need to find another country that could pinch hit and handle consular responsibilities for U.S. citizens in emergencies.
Ford and his team drew up a list of potential protecting states that Washington might approve. They checked with several European countries, but “several on the list were themselves going to close if we closed,” Ford, now a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, told FP in a phone interview. He knew Filippi from 2011 and 2012, when the two worked together in the small community of Western diplomats in Damascus.
“Eva said hers would stay open,” he said.
The Czech government felt it had good contacts with the various parties and groups in Syria, and that there was still work to be done by them there. “Eva had better insight into Syrian government thinking,” Ford recalled. The United States had little access to the wary regime of Bashar al-Assad — especially after August of 2011, when U.S. President Barack Obama said the Assad regime had no legitimacy.
Also, the Czech Republic is now a member of the European Union and NATO, and, Ford stressed, equally committed to stopping the carnage in Syria.
So partly by default — almost no embassies remained open — and partly out of affinity, the Czechs became Washington's choice to take on the unusual role of a new protecting power. (It's a rare addition. Switzerland and Sweden have done so for decades. Turkey briefly played this role for the United States in Libya in 2011.)
“I think that's because, in general, we have a very good relationship with the Czech Republic,” Ford said.
Proximity didn't hurt. The Czech Embassy is a few blocks from its U.S. counterpart in Damascus, and part of what the Czechs do as protecting power — aside from offering consular services for dual U.S. citizens — is looking after U.S. facilities on the ground.
“Eva has been a channel for US requests for information about American citizens [including dual citizens] in Syria,” Ford said. “I still think that's useful, to have that channel.” The Czechs set up video conferencing with the U.S. State Department to offer more insight into how things were on the ground, giving U.S. policymakers a clearer idea of what is really going on in government-held areas.
And it's not an easy lift for the small Czech mission: Of its eight staffers, including the ambassador, one is detailed to work full time on U.S. interests.
Filipi does not, however, negotiate on behalf of the United States. “The protecting power is a standard diplomatic instrument and does not require both countries to follow exactly the same political lines,” the Czech Embassy told FP.
“Our work with the Czech government on Syria has brought our two countries even closer together,” the U.S. State Department said in a statement. “We are extremely grateful for the assistance she and the entire Czech U.S. Interests Section provide to U.S. citizens in Syria, and we look forward to continued cooperation.”
The Czechs have played an important role in Syria beyond just providing a diplomatic assist to Washington, Ford noted. The Czech government implemented its first humanitarian projects in 2016 and, since then, delivered humanitarian aid to Syria in January, March, and July of this year. In January, Czech diplomats secured the release of a Polish national who had been in a Syrian prison since 2015.
But the Czech presence in Syria is not without its controversy back home.
Czech outlet Respekt, for example, has published articles suggesting Czech presence there legitimizes the Assad regime, and that Filipi is insufficiently critical of Assad, who has ruled over Syria while a civil war killed hundreds of thousands of his own people.
Czech Foreign Minister Lubomir Zaorálek suggested in April that the embassy might be closed if it were shown Assad used chemical weapons against civilians. Some in the Czech parliament suggested a Russian veto in the United Nations would be reason enough.
“The minute Russia uses its right of veto in the U.N., Ambassador Filipi should come home,” Ivan Gabal, deputy in parliament's lower house, said. “And I would make that clear in advance both to the Russians and to Bashar Assad.”
But Filipi was there before the civil war began, and, according to at least one Czech diplomat, should remain there until it ends — meaning the United States will maintain a tiny, invaluable diplomatic bridgehead in the country.
Hynek Kmonicek, Czech ambassador to the United States, who has known Filipi for years, was working for the Czech president when he sent her to Damascus in 2010. Kmonicek says he now tells her, “I sent you to a spa city. You'll stay there until it's a spa city again.”

Home storage unit is perfect for continent rich in solar and wind resources but short of reliable power sources, says Christine Mungai
Batteries that can store renewable energy for longer and at half the current cost have been hailed as an energy revolution that could transform Africa's power supply.
Tesla announces low-cost batteries for homes Read more
Launched by California-based tech company Tesla, the battery can hold enough energy to power a home for up to five hours.
Tesla boss Elon Musk said the company had Africa in mind when it developed the wall-mounted energy source. Just like the mobile phone allowed the continent to surge ahead in internet connectivity, so a battery pack that can power a home or business could allow Africans to leapfrog the limits of the grid.
The company has promised to release the technology into the public domain, encouraging others to develop their own models using the open source data.
At $3,500 (£2,267) for the 10 kilowatt hours version or $3,000 for a 7KWh version it's still relatively expensive, but within a few years the price is expected to drop as others develop their own models.
Tesla's new low-cost battery: 'the missing piece' in sustainable energy? Read more
Africa is the world's most energy-scarce continent. Sub-Saharan Africa has an installed capacity equivalent to that of Spain, and half of it is in South Africa alone.
But perhaps more importantly, Africa could become the global centre for green energy. Thanks to the expansive Sahara desert, strong winds along its coasts and its flat, arid interior, and geothermal reserves all along the Rift Valley, the continent has the world's highest reserves of renewable energy resources.
Here are three ways the new battery could make an impact:
Lighting and power
The battery could allow millions to leapfrog from no electricity at all straight to renewables.
Sub-Saharan Africa has more people living without access to electricity than any other region – more than 600 million people – nearly half of the global total. Although the continent is home to 13% of the world's population, it accounts for only 4% of global energy demand.
Worse still, the electricity available is erratic. Nigeria's power is notoriously unreliable, but Ghana and South Africa have also been recently plunged into blackouts, mainly because of a lack of investment in the electricity grid.
With the Powerwall currently able to supply five hours of power, an enterprising African engineer could hook up several together, scaling up the battery's capacity to provide continuous power to homes or commercial centres.
The battery could also finally break Africa's dependance on fuel guzzling generators. In 2012, the cost of fuel for backup generators used by businesses and households is estimated to have been at least $5bn.
Nigeria is said to have the biggest concentration of generators per square kilometre in the world; the country accounts for almost three-quarters of electricity supply provided by back-up generators in Africa.
Mobile tech hubs
Today, technology hubs are springing up all over Africa's cities. There are currently at least 90 tech hubs across the continent.
Kenya is planning to build a tech city – its “silicon savannah” – costing $14.5bn from scratch at Konza, 60km away from the capital in Nairobi. Ghana plans to build Hope City, a $10bn high-tech hub outside Accra, aiming to turn Ghana into a major tech player too.
Tesla Motors to open source its technology Read more
Meanwhile, companies like Facebook and Google have ambitious plans to deploy wireless internet across the globe using drones or hot-air balloons to carry the signal.
But the combination of a solar panel battery and drone/balloon internet, it might only be a matter of time before the idea of a physical tech city itself becomes obsolete.
Using the new batteries, a tech hub – and workplaces in general – could become more mobile, springing up guerrilla-style anywhere in urban or rural Africa, like a flash mob for geeks.

Disengaging from government
With the possibility of being entirely off-grid, the home battery could finalise the disconnection of African everyday life from the happenings in the political sphere.
Traditionally, the relationship between a government and its people is one of bartering political support for the provision of services, such as roads, schools, electricity, water and security.
But increasingly, African life today is characterised by an extensive retreat of the state from these functions.
In Kenya, for example, the number of private primary schools rose nearly 1,000% in a decade, while the number of government primary schools grew just 40%.
The Tesla battery could finalise the disconnection of African life from the political sphere
In Uganda, the percentage of university students attending private institutions jumped from 9% in 1999 to 74% in 2011. In South Africa, there are more private security guards than police and army combined.
Nairobi city senator Mike Sonko even recently launched a personally funded fleet of ambulances, tow trucks, garbage collectors, water bowsers and fire brigades to respond to citizen emergencies.
Already, studies show that the African middle class deliberately disengages from politics as a form of protest, particularly if the government is authoritarian or a quasi-democracy.
The result – if the Tesla batteries take off, and Africa goes off-grid – could be less pressure on states to provide infrastructure and services to its people, widening the gap between governments and voters.

The Trump administration is now confronted with the challenge of deciding how to oversee ObamaCare, a law it fiercely opposes but that is still on the books.
With the Senate's failure to repeal the healthcare law last month, the Trump administration now has pressing questions to answer about how it will manage a system that provides insurance to more than 10 million people.
President Trump has threatened to cancel key ObamaCare payments to insurers as part of an effort to make the law “implode.” But he is yet to follow through on that threat, leaving insurers in a state of uncertainty.
ADVERTISEMENT
The next sign-up period for enrolling in ObamaCare begins Nov. 1. The Obama administration ran advertisements to encourage enrollment, but Trump officials have signaled that promotion effort might come to an end.
Indeed, the Trump administration canceled some ObamaCare ads upon taking office in January, which was the end of the last sign-up period.
Trump officials also have the power to loosen up on enforcement and regulation, particularly on the individual mandate under the healthcare law for people to have coverage.
The difficulty for the White House is that Trump, and by extension congressional Republicans, could be blamed if ObamaCare premiums spike or the marketplaces start to collapse.
The Trump administration has sent mixed signals about whether it will seek to actively undermine ObamaCare.
Trump tweeted after the Senate's failed vote: “As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!”
But Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price Thomas (Tom) Edmunds PriceIs a presidential appointment worth the risk? Former Ryan aide moves to K street Grassley to test GOP on lowering drug prices MORE, asked about those comments on ABC's “This Week,” declined to reiterate the goal of letting the law implode.
Price said Trump's “implode” remark simply “punctuates the concern that he has about getting this moved in the right direction.”
On NBC, Price added that he had a duty to uphold ObamaCare. “Our responsibility is to follow the law,” Price said. “And again, we take that responsibility seriously and we will continue to do so. But remember that the current law right now is failing the American people.”
For those involved in providing ObamaCare coverage, the conflicting messages from the administration are a source of frustration.
“The biggest challenge that we have right now is the unknown, because this is the first enrollment season with the new administration,” said Shelli Quenga, director of programs at the Palmetto Project in South Carolina, one of the “navigator” organizations across the country that help people enroll in ObamaCare coverage.
Quenga said she is worried there will not be advertising from the administration to make people aware of the sign-up period.
Despite the uncertainty, much of the routine work on ObamaCare at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is proceeding as normal.
Career officials traveled to a conference of navigators in Baltimore in June to coordinate on strategy for signing people up. And HHS recently issued It's yearly online training for navigators, which Quenga said is “better than it has been in previous years” because there are now more enrollment periods under the belt.
But there are limits to what career officials can do without the sign-off of the political leadership.
The Obama administration, for example, pushed last year to recruit an insurer to offer coverage in an Arizona county that was at risk of having zero providers operating in it.
This year, the risk of “bare counties” with no insurers is spreading to more places, with several states facing the possibility of having rural counties without any ObamaCare options next year.
Washington state averted that risk in June by finding insurers to fill in its empty counties.
But the state insurance commissioner, Mike Kreidler, said that the Trump administration was “pretty much absent” from that effort to fill the counties.
Kreidler said career officials at HHS “help cheer you on, but there's very little they can wind up doing” without the support of the political appointees opposed to ObamaCare.
Insurers and many healthcare experts say that the biggest source of instability is Trump's threat to end the payments to insurers, known as cost-sharing reductions (CSRs). Those payments reimburse insurers for providing discounted insurance to low-income ObamaCare enrollees.
Insurers would need to spike premiums to make up for the lost money if the payments were canceled, and the uncertainty about receiving the payments has already caused premium increases for 2018.
Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, for example, has proposed a 22.9 percent premium increase for next year, but it says it only would have proposed an 8.8 percent increase if it knew the CSR payments would continue.
Price also left the door open to waiving enforcement of the mandate to have coverage, which is another worry for insurers, who fear that only sick people would then remain in the market, causing premium increases.
“All things are on the table to try to help patients,” Price told ABC when asked about waiving the mandate.
The conservative group Freedom Partners is pushing Price to make it easier for states to apply for waivers for ObamaCare regulations, though it did not echo calls for letting the law implode.
“The Secretary has within his abilities to do a bunch of things that ultimately won't get rid of ObamaCare but will start to provide some of the relief that people expect,” said Nathan Nascimento, the vice president of policy at Freedom Partners.
Yet administrative actions to increase flexibility under ObamaCare would be a significant step down from Congress repealing the law. In fact, some in Congress are now discussing a bipartisan fix to shore up the stability of ObamaCare markets, in part by guaranteeing CSR payments.
Price himself used the word “fix” in an appearance on Fox News on Wednesday.
“Both folks in the House and the Senate, on both sides of the aisle frankly, have said that ObamaCare doesn't work and it needs to be either repealed or fixed,” he said.
This is a Lenten letter from Maronite Archbishop Samir Nassar in Syria, translated by Sr. Margaret Charles Kerry, FSP. May we keep these suffering people in our prayers and offer sacrifices for them this Lent. – Sr. Theresa Aletheia
VIGILANT SERVANTS
It was Tuesday March 26, 2013, at 11 A.M. when shrapnel killed Deacon Camille on road to the church. Following his death, the parents of the priests were eager for me to leave, to leave Damascus. They were afraid for safety of their children. I proposed that the priests leave if they wanted to. The diocese does not have the right to keep them here under these conditions. They have all answered: “YOU REMAIN, WE REMAIN”
Providence has since protected us. Our deacon martyr had the role of distributing bread to the poor. The priests took over and each of them has become a social worker, good Samaritans who watch over the charitable activities in their parish. This is necessitated by the intense fighting in Syria and the waves of refugees that unfortunately arrive each day.
2015 was quite hard for the diocese: Two shells caused significant damage in the historic cathedral , the roof of the library caught fire and collapsed , the old sanitary facilities, built in 1958, succumb to the fire, and the room of Father Jean caught fire. The heavy restoration work was carried out by priests during my absence (health problems). They gave up days of rest in order to complete the work. In a gesture of rebellion against death and destruction, these courageous priests launched the construction of three chapels in the modest suburban districts, mobilizing the faithful around these three projects which are a sign of hope and faith in the future of the Church in Syria. This vitality highlights their pastoral proximity during this year of mercy and great suffering.
The first chapel, dedicated to the Martyrs of Damascus (1860), was inaugurated on January 8, 2016. Two other chapels will follow. This first one is a step on the path of reconstruction. Only the Lord gives peace. The Church and our Good Shepherd are proud of these priests, vigilant servants who cling to their mission under the bombs. They are the strength and future pledge of a martyred Christianity that refuses to die.
From Damascus, February 14, 2016.

The former mayor of Washington, D.C., Adrian Fenty, and Michelle Rhee, the school chancellor he installed, took heat for their aggressive school reforms, but a new study vindicates their controversial evaluations of teachers. From 2007 to 2010, Rhee implemented a student-focused teacher-evaluation system called IMPACT, which relies heavily on student performance to judge teachers. The city still uses the system, and new data indicate that it has helped keep the best teachers and improve academic achievement.

IMPACT is a system in which teachers are rated annually. It's based half on student achievement and half on four other job-performance factors. Teachers rated at the bottom of a five-point scale are deemed ineffective and fired, and ones at the top receive raises and bonuses. This week, the American Enterprise Institute released a report by Arnold F. Shober suggesting that removing underperforming teachers and installing new ones has improved student outcomes, and that monetary rewards for excellence have led to higher retention rates of the best teachers.
Prioritizing students' needs above those of teachers constitutes the revolutionary idea at the core of IMPACT. Fenty was given the newfound power to enact standards that were not subject to collective-bargaining negotiations with teachers, making unions unable to weaken the new rules. Many teachers scoffed at the notion that they would be held professionally responsible for how students performed, and they thought it was madness to jettison peer evaluations of fellow teachers in favor of student evaluations.

The political conflict resulting from IMPACT and other reforms may have contributed to Fenty's being voted out of office, but students are reaping the benefits of Rhee's reforms during Fenty's tenure. IMPACT and other standards made it easy to demonize Rhee as “aggressive” because her changes were affecting teachers' once-comfortable job situation. When you replace teachers, it takes time to see improvement in student outcomes, but teachers can voice their displeasure without delay. That Rhee was able to make changes at all depended on teachers' unions not having veto power.
Now student test scores are up and more good teachers are staying in Washington, which imparts a valuable lesson: Evaluating teachers based on student performance can work. Should reformers start using IMPACT in other districts around the country? Systems have to be tailored to their environment, and that brings us to another aspect of D.C.'s reform that the author mentions: its “robust school choice market.” The power of parents to choose where to send students to school goes hand-in-hand with giving schools the power to hire and fire based on whether students learn. Simply put, schools should judge teachers based on whether students are learning — because that is why children go to school.

Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler has embarked on his UEFA Pro Licence as he looks to launch a career in management.
The 40-year-old was at the FA's National Football Centre at St George's Park on Monday as he works towards obtaining the highest coaching qualification available.
Birmingham City boss Gary Rowett and former Blackburn Rovers manager Gary Bowyer are among those on Fowler's course and he hopes to complete it in 2017.
Fowler has been linked with jobs at various clubs since retiring from playing in 2012 but a move into management has yet to materialise.
The lack of time and patience given to managers these days doesn't put him off and he's determined to prove he can be a success in the dugout.
“I've got the other coaching badges and now I'm doing the Pro Licence which is the highest one you can do,” Fowler told the ECHO.
“I started it in January and it will take around a year. By next June I should have completed it.
“Everyone knows I want to be a manager. It's what I have always longed for and I am almost there now.
“Doing the Pro License shows how serious I am about it. I love football. I always have done.
“Regardless of what people think about me, I believe I'd make a good manager and I am determined to prove that.
“I am doing it all the correct way. Nobody can think I'm trying to take any shortcuts.
“I am getting all my badges and then I hope an opportunity will come my way. I am doing it the proper way and I'm enjoying it.”
‘Satirical' Masturbation Fine Bill Filed In Response To Women's Health Legislation
BALTIMORE (WJZ) — A Texas lawmaker has filed a “satirical” bill that would fine men for masturbating, in response to legislation aimed at women's health issues and abortions.
According to the Texas Tribune, state Rep. Jessica Farrar filed the “Man's Right To Know Act,” which would fine men $100 for masturbating and create a required booklet for men with medical information related to the benefits and concerns of a man seeking a vasectomy, a Viagra prescription, or a colonoscopy.
Texas House bill 4260 would also let doctors invoke their “personal, moralistic, or religious beliefs” in refusing to perform an elective vasectomy or prescribe Viagra.
In a statement, state Rep. Tony Tinderholt said Farrar lacked “a basic understanding of human biology.”
“I'm embarrassed for Representative Farrar. Her attempt to compare [HB 4260] to the abortion issue shows a lack of a basic understanding of human biology. I would recommend that she consider taking a high school biology class from a local public or charter school before filing another bill on the matter.”

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Tony Hall said the BBC was being "reconfigured" to meet changing expectations
The BBC has pledged to work more closely with the UK's arts and science institutions to "make Britain the greatest cultural force in the world".
BBC director general Tony Hall set out plans for the next decade, saying the corporation will become an "open BBC for the internet age".
A children's iPlayer and a pool of local reporters who will share work with local newspapers are also planned.
Yet he said funding cuts would mean the loss or reduction of some services.
Lord Hall laid out the plans at the Science Museum on Monday, ahead of the BBC's charter renewal in 2016.
Citing the importance of "excellence without arrogance", he said his plans did not signal "an expansionist BBC".
He did warn, however, that funding cuts would mean it would "inevitably have to either close or reduce some services", without specifying which areas might be under threat.
Image caption Professor Brian Cox announced a strand titled The New Age of Wonder
New initiatives will include an Ideas Service, which Lord Hall said would be an "open online platform" featuring material from galleries, museums and universities as well as the corporation itself.
He said: "Our new, open BBC will act as a curator bringing the best from Britain's great cultural institutions and thinkers to everyone.
"Britain has some of the greatest cultural forces in the world. We want to join with them, working alongside them, to make Britain the greatest cultural force in the world.
"We are extremely ambitious for this new service.
"Where Google's mission is to organise the world's information, ours in a smaller way would be to understand it. We will work with anyone who can help us understand this ever more complex world."
Image copyright PA Image caption The BBC is creating a new iPlayer - for children
The government launched a consultation on the BBC's Royal Charter, which sets out the purpose of the BBC and how it will be governed, in July, promising to ask "hard questions" about the corporation's size and ambition.
Other BBC plans include:
A pool of reporters to provide impartial reporting on councils and public services that could be used by both the BBC and other local news outlets
A child's-only iPlayer - iPlay - featuring not just television programmes but blogs, podcasts, games and educational tools
Opening up iPlayer to "showcase" content from other broadcasters
New versions of BBC education, news and entertainment services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
"Significant investment" in the BBC World Service, including a daily news programme for North Korea and more broadcasts to Russia, India and the Middle East
A news service for Ethiopia and Eritrea on medium wave and short wave
A review of the BBC's website to make sure it is "distinctive with a stronger focus on online broadcast content"
New digital ways to help fans find new music or music from the BBC archive
The director general also said he wanted to enable "producers, directors, writers, artists to have the creative freedom to do things they would find it harder to do elsewhere".
Quality drama will also be a priority, he said, and the BBC will make "bigger and bolder series" that will be made available on the iPlayer in their entirety.
Physicist and BBC presenter Professor Brian Cox also announced a science strand named The New Age of Wonder, which will be part of the Ideas Service and will be created in partnership with organisations like the Royal Institution.
Analysis - BBC media correspondent David Sillito
"This is not an expansionist BBC" is perhaps the key political line in today's announcements. This is a response to the accusation that the corporation is "imperial in its ambitions" made by Chancellor George Osborne (along with several newspapers).
Partnerships with cultural bodies, sharing news with local newspapers, opening up the iPlayer to third party content - the mood music is all about co-operation rather than competition.
The second theme can be seen most clearly in the plans for bigger and bolder drama and giving people the chance to "binge" watch. The BBC is in a global marketplace - Netflix, Amazon, Google, Apple and HBO - the traditional media landscape is being blown apart.
The BBC's problem is looking after its core audience and responding to a technological transformation. It will take money and the BBC has just taken a £650m cut. Those "tough choices" mentioned in the speech is the theme that has not yet been announced.
Lord Hall described the recent agreement by the BBC to cover the £600m cost of providing free television licences for over-75s as a "tough deal" that would require "some very difficult choices" to be made.
He said: "Having already saved 40% of the BBC's revenues in this charter period, we must save close to another 20% over the next five years."
Details of how those savings will be made and which services might be under threat will be announced in the coming months, he added.
In a charter review proposals document published on Monday, however, the BBC suggests that "some existing services" might no longer be needed in future.
"Streaming news may replace rolling news," the document states. "Children may prefer iPlay to scheduled television. The Ideas Service might mean we no longer need BBC Four."
Later in the same document, though, the BBC states "it is too early to be specific about the service changes that we will need to make."
'Trojan horse'
The BBC's plans for "a network of 100 public service reporters across the country" did not find favour with the Scottish Newspaper Society, who labelled the proposal "a Trojan horse which will undermine long-established publications and destroy local news agencies".
"Instead of helping local news publishers, it would make the BBC even more powerful and would further concentrate coverage of news in the hands of the state-funded broadcaster," said its director John McLellan.
The News Media Association, which represents national, regional and local news media organisations across the UK, expressed similar concerns, saying the corporation's proposals represented "BBC expansion into local news provision and recruitment of more BBC local journalists through the back door".
"The local newspaper sector already employs thousands of journalists and is the only reliable source of independent and trusted local news across the UK," said its vice chairman Ashley Highfield. "There is no deficit which the BBC needs to plug."
"Under the guise of being helpful, the BBC would end up replacing independent local news services," Mr McLellan told Radio 4's The World at One earlier, calling the plan "a further expansion of the BBC's encroachment".
Yet this accusation was rejected by James Purnell, the BBC's director of strategy, who told the same programme it was "very much not the goal" for the BBC to "take over all local journalism".
Today at an industry event, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon didn't mince words when it came to bitcoin. “It's a fraud,” he said, adding that it “won't end well,” reports Bloomberg .
Dimon said that he would fire any of his traders if they began trading bitcoin. “For two reasons,” he said, “It's against our rules, and they're stupid.”
It should be noted that Dimon has long been bearish on bitcoin, likely because JPMorgan, for years, has attempted to build digital currencies that would rival it. In 2013, the bank filed a patent for an electronic currency that bore a striking resemblance to bitcoin.
Dimon, however, isn't the only figure warning about the bitcoin bubble; U.K. financial watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority issued a striking warning today to those investing in cryptocurrencies. It warned that doing so is extremely risky and investors should be prepared to lose all of the money they invested.
The market has reacted. Shortly after Dimon's comments were made public, bitcoin prices dropped. The price peaked today at $4,368.22, and is currently at $4,101.49.
Bitcoin has been steadily rising over the last year. Although with Dimon not a fan, who's to say what longevity the cryptocurrency will have.
Still, criticism hasn't tempered the voracity of startups aimed at bringing more investors aboard, like the one some MIT grads started to let anyone invest in or start a bitcoin fund.

Single dads everywhere are no longer feeling so alone, thanks to Yannick Vicente's cartoons.
The French artist started illustrating his interactions with 4-year-old daughter Anaé shortly after she was born.
In the sweet, single-panel drawings, Vicente depicts the struggles many single dads face on a daily basis, from brushing her hair the right way to having the talk about the birds and the bees.

"I wanted to make these drawings for my daughter," Vicente, 31, told TODAY. "I hope she can see them later and realize how much I love her with all my heart."
While Anaé's mother lives nearby and is still involved in making decisions about important things such as her education, it's Vicente who is left with the daily tasks.

And although she's young, Anaé recognizes herself and her dad in the drawings.
She recently pointed out how he makes himself thinner than he is in real life.
Her favorite cartoon is one where her father is attempting to do her hair. "Don't worry daddy, it's not so bad," she tells him.

"She laughs at this one because it's the absolute truth," Vicente said. "I struggled to learn how to do her hair."
Asked about his favorite cartoon, Vicente didn't have to think twice before picking one:

Ask any college basketball coach in the country right now and he'll tell you this season has been the craziest in recent memory. but the reality remains: someone ultimately will be crowned national champion.
Tom Izzo, who has taken Michigan State to six Final Fours in his career, knows a thing or two about peaking at the right time. Last year, he took the Spartans to the national semifinals after earning a No. 3 seed in the Big Ten tournament -- finishing two games back of Maryland and four behind Wisconsin, the team the Spartans ended up losing to in the conference tournament.
(Before you finish reading, take five seconds NOW to sign up for our FREE Terps newsletter. We'll deliver the latest big Maryland sports news to you!)
The Terps have the third seed this time around -- winning a tiebreaker over Purdue, Iowa and Wisconsin -- and perhaps the most talented starting lineup when they begin play in Indianapolis on Friday at 9 p.m. against either Wisconsin or the winner of Nebraska-Rutgers.
And Izzo, whose Spartans finished a game ahead of the Terps in second place, still believes in Mark Turgeon's team.
“I still think Maryland, top to bottom if you look at their team and you thought of the best players and best bigs and guards and this and that, I think they're still the most talented team in the Big Ten,” he said during a Big Ten teleconference on Monday.
The Terps have lost four of their last six, but as Turgeon is quick to point out, they've had tough road games against Indiana and Purdue during that stretch. With an unbalanced schedule, they didn't get a chance to host either of the conference's top two teams -- Indiana and Michigan State -- and lost when they travelled to East Lansing and Bloomington.
“I think teams can turn on the dime, but I'm not disappointed with the way we're playing. I'm disappointed that we've lost a couple of games lately, but we made three seed in a great league,” Turgeon said on Monday. “I'm happy to be the three seed, we've had to overcome some things and we're looking forward to the postseason.”
If you look at preseason predictions, it's easy to say the Terps have underachieved -- nobody expected them to be ranked 18th in the AP Poll right now -- but they're still one of four teams to get a double bye in the Big Ten tournament. And that was no easy task in a conference that saw eight teams win at least 10 league games for the first time in history.
“To me it's going to be harder to move on in the Big Ten tournament than it might be to move on in the NCAA Tournament,” Izzo said. “This has been the craziest Big Ten I've been in.”
New Delhi: Merely months after Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi's headline-grabbing rejection of the 'nonsense' ordinance, it is back to business as usual at the Congress party headquarters. The list of candidates for the Delhi assembly polls reveals that the withdrawal of the controversial ordinance overturning the Supreme Court order keeping criminals out of politics has made little difference.
The list of 56 candidates released yesterday includes names of three sitting MLAs against whom serious criminal charges are pending. This comes on the heels of the Rajasthan list, which saw the Sonia Gandhi-led central election committee handing out tickets to family members of jailed leaders including Mahipal Maderna who is an accused in the Bhanwari Devi murder case.
The most controversial of the three candidates on the Delhi list is Okhla MLA Asif Mohd Khan who has 16 criminal cases pending against him. A recent report by the Association of Democratic Rights (ADR) analysing criminal details of sitting MLAs in the Delhi Assembly put Khan on top the list of six MLAs facing serious criminal cases. Charges against Khan include trafficking, murder, promoting enmity between communities and committing prejudicial actions to the maintenance of harmony.
More tellingly, Khan joined the Congress party in August and was welcomed with open arms for his formidable ‘winnability' quotient. His victory in Okhla in the September 2009 by-election, which he contested from an RJD ticket, ended a 15-year Congress reign. He defeated his closest rival by more than 5000 votes.
Dikshit, however, defended her choice of Khan telling Times of India that he was chosen only after “he had got a report from the Delhi Police clearing his name.”
Two other Congress MLAs, who figure on ADR's list of six, are Badli's Devender Yadav (against whom charges include theft and criminal intimidation) and Kasturba Nagar's Neeraj Basoya, an advocate by profession, who is accused of using dangerous weapons to cause hurt, criminal intimidation and wrongful restraint.
Was there any point at all then to the fiasco over the ordinance if parties are as eager as ever to hand out tickets to tainted MLAs? The impact of the withdrawal of the ordinance, says ADR co-founder Jagdeep Chhokar, will be felt when such candidates if elected are convicted during the life of the assembly. “They will be then disqualified from the Assembly.”
Speaking about the double standards of political parties that say one thing and do the exact opposite, Chhokar says, “Winnability is not the only thing. Elections are supposed to be free and fair. And if you have candidates who have serious criminal cases against them it is obviously not a free and fair election.”
The mounting public pressure to de-criminalise politics may explain why Law Minister Kapil Sibal, who not so long ago defended the controversial ordinance, is now speaking of introducing a bill in the Winter Session to keep candidates who have been chargesheeted from contesting elections. There are also rumours of opposition from within the Congress party to handing out tickets to candidates facing serious criminal charges.
“Parties are beginning to engage with the issue because they are being forced to engage with it. It only tells us that they will have to be forced more. They are not going to listen to logic or rationale or good sense," says Chhokar. "The Law Minister is now saying that candidates with serious criminal charges will not be allowed to contest. That is a reform that has been on the anvil for the last twenty years. But they haven't done anything about it. I hope more and more people will use NOTA (none of the above) option… [But] this kind of reform does not happen in one day.”

It's the future promised to us by the Jetsons, "Back To The Future" and even as far back as Jules Verne: Finally after decades of dreaming and waiting, a company has plans to make a flying car commercially available to the public within 24 months.
Last year, Slovakian company AeroMobil unveiled its latest prototype of an elongated, road-ready vehicle with stowable wings that can navigate both city traffic and the airspace in between landings and take-offs from the world's airports. (Forbes contributor Federico Guerrini covered the reveal in Vienna in October; check it out for more details on the latest model known as the Aeromobil 3.0.) Then, this week at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, Co-Founder and CEO Juraj Vaculik said that the company planned to move flying cars to market sooner than later.
"We are now scaling up quite fast, building the team, and the plan is that in 2017 we'll be able to announce... the first flying roadster," Vaculik told CNBC. "The point is not only to showcase that it's possible to marry together a plane and a car, but to really commercialize it."
Vaculik said he expects that the vehicle will initially appeal to luxury car fans and flight enthusiasts, and will have a price tag that also falls somewhere in between the latest offerings from Tesla Motors and a small plane of a "couple hundred thousand dollars."
The first commercially available model is expected to be a two-seater with a 435-mile range, take-off speed of 81 miles per hour, top air speed at around 124 miles per hour and an autopilot function.
Of course, when it comes to flying cars, the modus operandi often seems to be "hurry up and wait." American company Terrafugia also hopes to begin delivery of its own flying car model this year or next, something it originally hoped to achieve back in 2011.
Watch the latest prototype of the AeroMobil in action in the promotional video below:
Who is 'That Girl' anyway? Is she a sketchy drunk? An insecure mess? An attention whore? One thing is clear, the phrase That Girl is a stigma-laden expression. Whatever you're doing as That Girl, rest assured, you're doing it wrong. But a therapist who listens to women fret about being That Girl thinks maybe That Girl doesn't really exist, or if she does, she's just fine.
Dr. Rebecca Kennedy, a clinical psychologist, says she hears all about That Girl in her psychotherapy practice. She's "crazy with guys." She texts "too often." She wants exclusivity right away. Put simply, she can be described using the worst possible insult to a young millennial woman: needy.
Ignore the millennial tag for a moment, because "needy" as a pejorative knows no generational bounds. And as a descriptor, it's far more likely to be lobbed at women. I don't know a woman alive who hasn't been told at some point or another she's being needy for anything from having a case of the feels to wanting to talk about something, you know, more than once or longer than five minutes.
But what the fuck is needy anyway? It means having needs. The connotation, of course, is that you have too many needs, but it's tough to find an exact number of needs it's OK to have. One need, only on Sundays after dinner? Three needs a week? Annual Needs Fest Where All Needs Are Met, Then Never Referred to Again?
No, see, the neediness of any one person is a relative thing compared to whomever they are with. Being needy ultimately means needing more from the person you are with than they think you should need from them, or than they need from you.

But that's not what the Internet says! Search around and you'll find tons of advice for women on how to not be needy, all based on the well-understood idea that guys hate needy women, ergo, don't be any thing that a guy might hate, ya batshit harpy nutjob. Google around and behold the deep understanding of the Needy Woman and How Not to Be Her.
AskMen, for instance, kicks off a real doozy with this opener for a authoritative-sounding piece called "The Psychology of Needy Women."
Opening line: Needy women can be among the most frustrating aspects of a man's romantic life.

TRUE DAT. You're a dude just trying to have some chicken wings and all-a-sudden you gotta a lady tied to your muffler, spying on you. Their takeaway? Her parents probably fucked her up. However she is acting goes way back, bro, way back before you, and therefore has nothing to do with anything you are doing or saying, whether or not you demonstrate trustworthiness, an ability to speak full sentences, or, if, in fact, you even know how to be in a relationship.
Moving on, this Cosmo piece instructing women on how to be less needy outlines why needy is bad: "guys are repelled by neediness because it hints at a woman's insecurity." Ah yes, insecurity, that old female problem that never plagues men. Avoid this dark fate by not being needy. Voila! No really, you can do that by letting the relationship unfold organically. Oh ok, that's always a super specific pace that everyone in the universe follows, like not seeing a guy more than twice a week for the first month or two. Not answered: Can we eat after midnight? Must I wait four minutes to text back?
Another Cosmo piece details four ways women "come off as too needy," and they include NOT asking for his approval, NOT relying on him for fun, NOT reading into his actions, and of course that old time-tested needy girl move, NOT gluing yourself to him.

I will never ask a guy what he thinks of my bangs and/or preferred brand of glue again. But what gets me always about advice like this is that it never unpacks why women specifically might allegedly act this way in the first place. And more importantly, it sets the "correct" default behavior based on male preference for "less" interaction, and works back from there.
In other words, guys don't talk a lot or ask a lot questions, so they hate when you do it, and when you do it, it's naturally going to seem like TOO much of that shit. So let's stop being that way. Instead, you could look at how lack of trust is probably behind some of this stuff. Or that you would only read into a person's actions if they hadn't sufficiently explained them for you.
Also, hello? Lack of trust can be a reason for neediness from anyone. If you're asking probing questions about your dude's daily whereabouts like one of the Cosmo examples, you're not being needy, you're being distrustful and/or possessive. Have a conversation about why.

But back to Dr. Rebecca Kennedy. She asked her patients who talk about That Girl how to not be That Girl, and their answer was telling:
Don't let the guy know that you want more than he wants.
Ah yes. Never tip your hand in the game of love. Look, right here I will throw all comers a bone and admit that absolutely, yes, everyone likes a little game, a little mystery, a tiny bit of excitement in a relationship. But there is a huge difference between enjoying the getting-to-know you pace — an utterly arbitrary pace set by BOTH PEOPLE, NOT A MAGAZINE — versus a highly rigid gender-o-matic set of guidelines that prove for at least two months that you were a very good actor who Needed Nothing.

Also: Sometimes it's cool to be up front. Sometimes that can be its own thrill. The thrill of a relationship to me is not how long you both held out acting like badass Teflon robots. It's how well you connected and in what ways, and the adventure of finding those connections. That's the shit, morons!
Also, I've never met someone who isn't needy on some level. Not even once. Not even kinda. Yes, it's certainly our job if we want to be more self-actualized people to try to work that shit out and be happy with ourselves, but the idea that we have to act like we don't need anyone when the whole reason you are getting with a person is because you do, well, that is pure fucking farce.
Furthermore, a huge part of a healthy relationship knows what you need and owning it, and being able to state it clearly in actual sentences, not hope someone guesses while you are busy over there in the dark being a mysterious asshole. After that, your work is still not done, because you will need your things and the other person may or may not be capable of giving them to you or vice versa, and then maybe you will reconsider what your needs are, or whether you were even right to want to have that need met. That's the deal. Yawn. Um, sorry, I mean, just hang out twice a week at first. That will take care of it, too.

In Dr. Kennedy's practice, she realized that what the young women in her office were really fighting was more of needy bogey woman/inner critic than someone to be really truly concerned with.
I've never had a new patient come into my office telling me, I am That Girl. Help me! I asked some of my colleagues, and they confirm that while they've heard a lot about her, they haven't met her, either. If That Girl is such a social pariah, how come she never shows up in our offices to talk about how miserable she is?
Kennedy concludes that That Girl is doing alright. She's actually putting herself out there. Being vulnerable. Admitting what she wants. Going for it. She is careful to not reframe this as some Liberated Empowerment Model of Female Behavior or anything, she just presents the quiet idea that maybe That Girl is just fine, and she's just doing her, and it's not the hot mess you think it is. And her advice to young women is pretty simple: Make sure your needs are met. That won't look the same for everyone. That is OK.

Take us home, Doc:
Maybe That Girl isn't so crazy after all. When it comes to guys, she texts because she knows what she wants. She asks to be exclusive because she knows what she deserves. She also knows what she needs — and if that is what defines neediness then, yes, she is needy. Does she overshare sometimes? Sure. Is she the most sought-after girl among young men who are looking to play the field? Unlikely. Might she struggle to find a partner who will meet her high expectations? You bet. She has determined that these are worthwhile prices to pay for establishing self-respecting patterns for sex and romance.

From Philip Giraldi, “Fake News Versus No News” on Unz.com:
… The Anti-Semitism Awareness Act is intended to give the Department of Education investigatory authority over “anti-Jewish incidents” on America's college campuses. Such “incidents” are not limited to religious bigotry, with the examples cited in the bill's text including criticism of Israel and claiming that the holocaust was “exaggerated.” It is a thinly disguised assault on the Boycott Divest and Sanction (BDS) movement, which is non-violent, does not criticize Jews as a religion or ethnicity, and is actually supported by many Jewish Americans who are concerned about Israel's apartheid regime.
The Anti-Semitism bill makes Jews and Jewish interests a legally protected class, immune from any criticism. “Free speech” means in practice that you can burn an American flag, sell pornography, attack Christianity in the vilest terms or castigate the government in Washington all you want but criticizing Israel is off limits if you want to avoid falling into the clutches of the legal system. The Act is a major step forward in effectively making any expressed opposition to Israeli actions a hate crime and is similar to punitive legislation that has been enacted in twenty-two states as well as in Canada. It is strongly supported by the Israel Lobby, which quite likely drafted it, and is seeking to use legal challenges to delegitimize and eliminate any opposition to the policies of the state of Israel.
As the Act is clearly intended to restrict First Amendment rights if they are perceived as impacting on broadly defined Jewish sensitivities, it should be opposed on that basis alone, but it is very popular in Congress, which is de facto owned by the Israel Lobby. That the legislation is not being condemned or even discussed in the generally liberal media tells you everything you need to know about the amazing power of one particular unelected and unaccountable lobby in the U.S.
And there is always Iran to worry about. If the United States can successfully avoid a war with Russia, a conflict with the Mullahs could have major consequences even if the all-powerful U.S. military successfully rolls over its Iranian counterpart in less than a week. Iran is physically and in terms of population much larger than Iraq and it has a strong national identity. An attack by Washington would produce a powerful reaction, unleashing terrorist resources and destabilizing an economically and politically important region of the world for years to come. Currently, the nuclear agreement with Iran provides some measure of stability and also pushes backwards any possible program by Tehran to build a weapon. Iran does not threaten the United States, so why walk away from the agreement as some of Trump's advisors urge? Or violate the agreement's terms as the U.S. Congress seems to be doing by extending and tightening the sanctions regime with its just passed Iran Sanctions Extension Act? Look no further than the Israel Lobby. Hobbling Iran, a regional competitor, is a possible Israeli interest that should have nothing to do with the United States but yet again the United States government carries the water for the extreme right wing Netanyahu regime.
Israel for its part has welcomed the Trump election by building 500 new and completely illegal settler homes in what was once Arab East Jerusalem. Trump has surrounded himself with advocates for Israel and Prime Minister Netanyahu's expectation that he will have a free hand in dealing with those pesky Palestinians is probably correct. I would like to think that Donald Trump will unpleasantly surprise him based on actual American rather than Israeli interests but am not optimistic.
Indeed, deference to perceived Israeli interests enforced by the Israel Lobby and media permeates the entire American foreign policy and national security structure. Congressman Keith Ellison who is seeking to become Democratic National Committee Chairman is being called an anti-Semite for “implying U.S. policy in the region [the Middle East] favored Israel at the expense of Muslim-majority countries, remarks ADL's CEO Jonathan Greenblatt described as ‘deeply disturbing and disqualifying.' ” Donald Trump and his senior counselor Steve Bannon have also both been called anti-Semites and several other potential GOP appointees have been subjected to the media's fidelity-to-Israel litmus test.
The recently nominated Secretary of Defense James Mattis, who can hardly be called a moderate when it comes to Iran, has also been labeled an anti-Semite by the usual players. Why? Because in 2013 he told Wolf Blitzer “So we've got to work on [peace talks] with a sense of urgency. I paid a military security price every day as a commander of CENTCOM because the Americans were seen as biased in support of Israel, and [because of this] moderate Arabs couldn't be with us because they couldn't publicly support those who don't show respect for Arab Palestinians.”
Mattis will no doubt be reminded of his remarks when he is up for Senate confirmation. A predecessor Chuck Hagel was mercilessly grilled by Senators over his reported comment that the “Jewish lobby” intimidates congressmen. But ironically nearly everyone who is not an Israel-firster who is involved in U.S. foreign and security policy knows that aggressive Israeli colonization of the Palestinian West Bank and its siege of Gaza contribute greatly to terrorism against the United States, since Washington is regularly blamed for enabling Netanyahu. When General David Petraeus said pretty much the same thing as Mattis back in 2010 he was forced to “explain” his comments, retract them and then grovel before he was eventually given a pass by the Lobby.
And there is considerable self-censorship related to the alleged sensitivity of “Jewish issues,” not only in the media. I recently attended a conference on the Iraq invasion of 2003 at which the role of Israel manifested through its controlled gaggle of American legislators and bureaucrats as a factor in going to war was not even mentioned. It was as if it would be impolite or, dare I say, anti-Semitic, to do so even though the Israeli role was hardly hidden. Former Bush administration senior official Philip Zelikow has admitted that protecting Israel was the principal reason why the U.S. invaded Iraq and others have speculated that without the persistent neocons' and Israel's prodding Washington might not have gone to war at all. That is apparently what then Secretary of State Colin Powell also eventually came around to believe.
So let's stop talking about what Russia is doing to the United States, which is relatively speaking very little, and start admitting that the lopsided and completely deferential relationship with Israel is the actual central problem in America's foreign policy. Will the media do that? Not a chance. They would rather obsess about fake news and blame Putin.
There is bad news for the good dog. Lawrence-based Good Dog! Biscuits & Treats — the nonprofit company that employs residents of the Lawrence Community Shelter — has closed after losing key grant funding.
The maker of all-natural dog biscuits and other treats notified its retail partners earlier this month that it was closing. Dianne Huggins, an organizer of the not-for-profit, said a private funding organization recently pulled its support, leaving Good Dog in a financial bind.
“There is not a realistic path at this time to bring the business back,” Huggins said.
Huggins said sales of the dog biscuit products were strong at places such as The Merc, Checkers, Hy-Vee and a host of smaller specialty retailers. But the business never had the money to make investments in more baking equipment, which would have allowed it to expand its geographic reach. The relatively small volume of sales made it difficult for the business to consistently meet its payroll, which is where the grant money came into play.
Huggins said the business employed about four residents of the homeless shelter at any given time, with full-time employees making $9 an hour and part-time about $8 an hour.
The business, which for a while was based in East Lawrence but then moved into space at the new homeless shelter facility, was open for six years. I remember when they opened because the organizers somehow convinced me to try one of the biscuits when I was out interviewing them. (If I thought it would have helped, I would have given them an endorsement. It really was the best dog biscuit I've ever tried.)
During the business' six-year run, Huggins said 16 employees of the business have exited homelessness.
“We truly were successful in that regard,” Huggins said. “We are real proud of that.”
Huggins said leaders of the Lawrence Community Shelter are discussing possibilities for other programs that could provide jobs to shelter guests.
“I'm certain there are people thinking about that, but we'll just have to wait and see what develops,” she said.
In other news and notes from around town:
• City commissioners are looking for ways to cut costs, too. In particular, commissioners are trying to figure out how to lower the estimated $30 million price tag for a new police headquarters building.
Well, architects for the project have delivered a report that presents a plan to knock the price down to an estimated $25.7 million. The cost reductions were made simply by reducing the size of the building and its underground parking garage. The building shrinks to about 62,000 square feet, down from about 73,000 square feet previously proposed. For comparison purposes, the police department has about 37,000 square feet of space today, although it is spread out in several locations.
The proposed parking garage, which would be for police department vehicles, not employee vehicles, would shrink to about 15,000 square feet, down from about 20,000 square feet. Plans call for the garage to have a firing range.
An outbuilding that would be used for evidence storage would shrink to about 4,000 square feet, down from about 6,400 square feet.
Now that architects have uttered these figures, I suspect a majority of city commissioners will latch onto them and the building will shrink in size and cost. The question is whether commissioners will push for further cuts.
The more interesting debate may be where city commissioners decide to locate this facility. My sense is that commissioners are split on the issue. There are some who think highly of a site across the street from the Hallmarks Cards production plant. That would put the police headquarters building right next to the West Lawrence interchange for the Kansas Turnpike. Others, I believe, are concerned about the expense that comes with that site. The site, owned by Hallmark, has 47 acres and Hallmark is not interested in selling it off in parcels. Hallmark is seeking about $3.2 million for the site.
The architect's study indicates the acquisition costs for the Hallmark site are likely the highest of the five studied. In addition, architects estimate it will cost $750,000 to $830,000 to prepare the site for development, which makes the site development costs the highest of the five sites.
The site also has an added twist. The city only needs about 15 acres for the police headquarters building, but would be buying about 47 acres. I know some commissioners already are running numbers on what it could sell the excess property for to help recoup costs. That certainly could work, but it also essentially would put the city in the private development business. Which developer would the city sell to, and for what type of project? Remember that voters likely are going to be asked to approve the funding for the police headquarters building in November. Voters likely are going to want to know the details of what will happen to the extra land, and in this town, that certainly could be a complicating factor.
But I know that some commissioners really like the idea of having the police headquarters greeting visitors coming off the turnpike. We'll see whether this latest report does anything to dampen the enthusiasm.
As a reminder, the other sites under consideration are: 14 acres in the city-owned VenturePark business park near 23rd and O'Connell; 26 acres in the Fairfield Farms development near 23rd and O'Connell; 41 acres southwest of 31st and Louisiana; and 29 acres of city-owned land at Wakarusa and Overland drives.
I intend to write a more complete article on the new report, so check back later today for more details.
• Finally, one more piece of bad funding news on this Friday. City officials learned that a much anticipated trail project through East Lawrence was not selected to receive funding through a state grant program. The trail project would have connected Hobbs Park near 11th and Delaware Streets with Constant Park near Sixth and Kentucky streets. The city applied for a transportation grant through the Kansas Department of Transportation. KDOT, however, only had enough money in the program to fund 20 of the 43 projects submitted. It is uncertain when the next grant from the state will become available.
Commissioner Bob Schumm has made this trail a priority, and it has received a lot of public support from several groups that promote alternative transportation and the benefits of exercise. It will be interesting to see if a last-ditch effort is made this week to add the full cost of the project to the city's 2015 budget. Based on the last estimates I've seen, the project is expected to be about $1 million. Commissioners are scheduled to set the budget at their Tuesday evening meeting.
I like to say "this is a philosophy, not a business". When you travel, you are in a strange place, with strange people, and sometimes strange customs. I am here to help you bridge the gap from your world, to ours. I want to help you truly see this city, be my friends, and learn about how similar and different we all are. This is Not Another Hostel, the only donation based hostel/homeless shelter hybrid in the world.
Not Another hostel has been around since 2012, originally only focused on housing travelers. In 2015, I purchased multiple houses to be able to not only host travelers, but the homeless of Pittsburgh as well. The travelers are in one house, and the formerly homeless in another. Both are highly screened before acceptance, and I have had 4,000 guests without incident. The shelter focuses on helping families, as there are not many options for families to stay together in the homeless shelter system in Pittsburgh. They can stay for free for as long as they need as long as they are actively trying to get a job or save money for their own home. Usually people save up enough money to get back on their feet in 3-6 months.
For the hostel, I believe that by charging a guest money, you start off with a business contract where you cannot truly be friends. With a donation based model, you build a social contract where we interact as people, instead of a business owner/customer. The hostel truly runs on a "pay it forward" model where travelers can stay for free, but have the option to contribute to help others get housing in the future, too. Unlike some donation based business models, I do not pressure donations in any way. I feel that all contributions should be organic and voluntary. 100% of donations go towards keeping the project running, and all donations are tax deductible under Not Another Hostel's 501 (c) (3) non profit charitable status. I do not take a salary from these projects.
Life can be a scary and dark place sometimes, but my belief is that at our core, "people are good". In a world plagued by violence and hate, it's hard to believe that sometimes.
Stay at Not Another Hostel, and let me prove it to you.

Hello Jets Nation. You may remember me from about a month ago when I introduced you to Carter Jansen and his friend Graeme.
For those of us who didn't read the first article (link above), Carter Jansen was a young man who was planning on attending his first ever Jets game since the team came back to Winnipeg last season. He was going to do so with his friend Graeme (whom he had met playing EA's NHL games). Tragically, Carter never got to that game as he was killed in a car accident prior to the season. His friend Graeme resolved to do something for this young man who was taken far too soon and so he put together this jersey tour. A jersey with Carter's name on it will be sent to fans who volunteer their time to him, to then take to their assigned team's game and take a picture with the jersey on a seat at the game. Anything else they can do will be graciously accepted and thanked. Then the jersey will be sent back to Graeme to continue on. We at Jets Nation heard of Graeme's plans and offered to help facilitate in any way.
The response we received was absolutely heart warming and just went to prove that hockey fans are indeed the best. I will be making every effort to keep everyone updated on the on-going trek around the league and then the final presentation to Carter's family.
I will be providing Jets Nation and all fans with updates as the season goes on with the travels of Carter's jersey and with anything else Graeme might need in getting the jersey around.
The cost of the new jerseys and the transit of these jerseys to Graeme has become a little heavy so some adjustments to the tour will happen. He is now going to be purchasing a Reebok jersey for the traveling one. It's more cost effective to purchase and if something did happen, a new one should be easier to get for a reasonable price.
We need your help:
We also have run into some snafus with the schedule of some of the people who had offered to do it previously (and that is completely understandable.) So as of right now we really need fans who will be attending games in these listed cities to offer to help out.
Sharks
Panthers
Lightning
Capitals
Flyers
Bruins
Blackhawks
Remembering that Graeme is scheduling a trip to the other 30 arenas. He is doing his best to make dates work for everyone. So please share with anyone you can.
Graeme will be on CBC Radio in Winnipeg (who when they read our story sought out Graeme) this Monday September 18th at 8am.
Contact me anytime through twitter @TheNationDan or email dan@thenationnetwork.com
Please share this story with anyone you can. Please put us in contact with hockey fans from around the league (in the list above) and lets give Carter his proper remembrance.
World of Final Fantasy is upon us, and you can pick it up on a store shelf near you. And you'll definitely want to, considering everything it offers for both Final Fantasy fans and those with an affinity for the Pokémon series. It's definitely one of the most stark departures from the norm the Final Fantasy franchise has ever taken, but that's exactly what makes it so much fun.
It might be a little difficult to discern what you actually do in the game, however, since it's gotten little or no mainstream advertisement and the trailers that are available online don't exactly communicate the nature of the game itself. You'll almost certainly love it if you enjoy Final Fantasy lore or Pokémon, but in case you need help making a purchasing decision, here are five things you should know before playing World of Final Fantasy.
It's Basically Pokémon, In All Actuality
The main task you're given in World of Final Fantasy is to collect beings known as “Mirages.” Without spoiling too much, you were previously masters of these creatures and commanded a veritable army of them. They're essentially smaller versions of Final Fantasy enemies and characters, like miniature Tonberries or chocobos, and you can “capture” them during battle to befriend them.
You'll use items called “prismariums” to do so, but only after whittling some of their health down or reaching a state where they're vulnerable to being captured. From there you can carry a select few with you as you travel and you can swap them out at a later time. You can even watch them evolve into more powerful forms. Sound familiar? The core gameplay is basically identical to Pokémon, if you haven't gotten that already, from the main structure of the game to the adorable creatures you befriend who aid you in battle.
It's A Nostalgic Love Letter to Final Fantasy Fans
Do you get choked up at the thought of listening to the Final Fantasy VII soundtrack? Do you have a carefully curated collection of Final Fantasy action figures? Can you name all of the summons throughout the different games? You'll absolutely love World of Final Fantasy. From the villages you discover to the characters you interact with, the game is positively teeming with references to the entire Final Fantasy mythos. There are Easter Eggs hardcore fans can appreciate as well as simple references any casual fan will get as well. It's a carefully written love letter to anyone who's invested in the series since its inception, and you'll get that from the moment you boot up the game. This is the game fans have been waiting for.
You'll Need To Strategize If You Don't Want to Die Over and Over Again
As adorable World of Final Fantasy may be, it can also be extremely difficult. There's a stacking mechanic that comes into play where you can place your Mirages on top of your characters or vice versa, and this is often the key to performing well or absolutely terribly in battles. Stacking your Mirages can add HP to your characters, special abilities, and more. You're infinitely more powerful with Mirages on top of you and below you. So if you don't spend any time figuring out a strategy that works best for you, you'll find yourself losing battles left and right. Even when you do know what you're doing it's still a challenging game. It's a refreshing sort of challenging, however, so you'll still have fun.
Cross-Save Lets You Play At Home or On The Go With PlayStation Vita
World of Final Fantasy is available for both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, and it supports the Cross-Save feature. This means that your save files are uploaded to the cloud so you can leave your home after a PlayStation 4 session, grab your Vita on the way out the door, and pick up where you left off while playing on your work commute or at a friend's house. Unfortunately, the game doesn't support Cross-Buy, so you'll have to purchase both versions separately if you're interested in that kind of portability. Given its many similarities to Pokémon, it's a great candidate for play on the go since it's very conducive to enjoying for small chunks of time.
If You're Expecting A Serious Final Fantasy, You'll Be Disappointed
World of Final Fantasy is like Pokémon, it's challenging, and it's awesome for fans of the series. What it isn't, however, is serious business. There's silliness going on from the moment you start the game, and it permeates nearly every scene. From Lann's constant stream of stupid questions and exclamations to the bizarre way that their constant companion Tama speaks. It's a lighthearted romp that belies its more difficult side. You won't find angsty Final Fantasy characters here except for adorable versions of Cloud and Squall and others, and while it can have its darker moments it's still a fun, silly adventure rife with strikingly cute characters.

US Air Force Colonel Thatcher Cardon, MD, has won a competition to develop a new diaper to cradle astronauts' soiled nethers for up to six days of spacefaring.
While no details were given on the design of the space nappy, Cardon has been declared the recipient of $15,000 for submitting his MACES Perineal Access & Toileting System (M‑PATS) to NASA's Space Poop Challenge.
NASA had launched its global crowdsourcing competition for "solutions to human waste management inside a spacesuit" last year, which required that astronauts' health and safety be protected from their own excrement for up to six days.
The current ablution solutions can only handle less than 24 hours of waste, but over the 60-day competition, the Space Poop challenge received more than 5,000 proposed replacements from 19,000 individual registered competitors, with more than 150 teams from "every country and continent on Earth (including Antarctica)" participating.
The second-place $10,000 prize went to Katherine Kin, Stacey Marie Louie, and Tony Gonzales, known as the Space Poop Unification of Doctors (SPUDs) Team, for their Air-powered Spacesuit Waste Disposal System. $5,000 was awarded to Hugo Shelley for SWIMSuit, offering Zero Gravity Underwear for 6‑Day Use.
"The response to the Space Poop Challenge exceeded all of our expectations," said NASA Tournament Lab deputy director Steve Rader. "The level of participation and interest went far beyond what we expected for such a short competition."
"It was wonderful to see the global response from our crowdsourcing challenge," said Kirstyn Johnson, space suit technology engineer at NASA. "We enjoyed seeing the innovative approaches that were sent in, given such a demanding scenario. Others at NASA are now thinking about ways we can leverage a crowdsourcing approach to solve some more of our spaceflight challenges." ®

The teams picking at the top of drafts are always hoping for immediate impact.
But for teams deeper in the order, patience is a necessity, especially with a growing sense that players entering the NFL aren't as ready as they used to be. Whether it's because of increased early entrants or the systems college teams are running, more and more teams end up drafting players who can't be immediately useful.
Panthers General Manager Dave Gettleman invoked former 49ers coach Bill Walsh saying he had a “two-year rule” to see if a player had a future with the team, but said it now has to be a three-year process.
“We're not getting instant oatmeal anymore,” Gettleman said. “And you've got to understand there's going to be growing pains. Nothing's easy. A guy can have all the talent in the world. But this game is about fundamentals and when we're getting them they don't have it. So our coaches have to really coach and teach, and it takes longer.”
Gettleman illustrated his willingness to take the long view last year, drafting linebacker Shaq Thompson with the 25th pick, choosing a guy who might eventually replace Thomas Davis. Thompson started 10 games but played a fairly limited role for the Panthers this year (only 34.3 percent of their defensive snaps), as they try to get the college utility player ready to contribute more.
And the guy Gettleman might have preferred to Thompson also illustrates that principle. The Panthers would have taken Florida offensive tackle D.J. Humphries, but the Cardinals chose him a pick before. Humphries wasn't ready to win a starting job out of training camp, and was inactive for all 16 games this season.
“We drafted D.J. last year knowing we were going to redshirt him because we had so much to teach him,” Cardinals coach Bruce Arians said. “If he threw him out there, he was going to fail. Once they fail, it's hard to get those scars off. He didn't dress a game purposefully just to get better and better.”
For teams like the Panthers and Cardinals which have had success recently, it's easier to give a guy time to learn, since the staffs have a sense of security that allows development. Bad teams with coaches under pressure don't have the luxury. It also takes a roster talented enough that rookies aren't forced into situations they're not ready for.
The PBE has been updated with Sivir's relaunch - this mean's updated model, skins, particles, lore animation and everything else for our favorite Battle Mistress! In addition to that, we also have a slew of TENTATIVE balance changes aimed at Aatrox, Olaf, and the volatile Xerath rework.

"When the people of Valoran speak of the ''Battle Mistress,'' there is only one woman to whom they refer. Combining unflinching bravery with prowess in combat and endless ambition, Sivir's reputation as a fortune hunter is only rivaled by her amassed wealth and acclaim. Faced with the revelation of her mysterious heritage, Sivir must now weigh her desire to follow her own path against the burden of a greater legacy.
Sivir grew up among the desert nomads of Shurima, mastering the art of tomb robbing and enjoying a life without strong ties to any one place. She excelled at the mercenary life, accumulating riches, followers and reputation with ease. As her fame spread beyond the desert sands, she caught the attention of wealthy patrons across all of Valoran. The most influential of these benefactors was Noxus High Command. Sivir served the whims of the brutal nation with little concern for consequence. Their partnership proved to be a profitable one until the Ionian conflict broke out. She chose to take no part in the messy invasion and severed her ties.
It was no surprise to Sivir when the Noxians next paid her a visit, but where she expected assassins, she instead received an offer. Cassiopeia, the daughter of one of Noxus's most influential families, claimed to have unearthed the location of ancient Shurima's greatest treasure. All that the noblewoman required was an experienced tomb robber as an escort.
The expedition proved to be more than Sivir and Cassiopeia bargained for. The ancient tomb held neither the treasure Cassiopeia had promised, nor the weapon she coveted. Despite Sivir's warnings, the Noxian flung open the door to the entombed vault, setting events in motion that would change not just Sivir's life, but all of Shurima forever.
'What's lost can be found... and sold.''

Republicans are finally beginning to question Donald Trump as their 2016 presidential nominee, saying Trump's doubling down on attacking a federal judge with Mexican heritage was one of the more overtly racist statements from the GOP in years.
“If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-SC, told the New York Times . “There'll come a time when the love of country will trump hatred of Hillary.”
“There are a lot of people who want to be loyal to the Republican Party, including me,” Graham told NBC on Tuesday. “There'll come a point in time where we're gonna have to understand that it's not just about the 2016 race, it's about the future of the party, and I would like to support our nominee: I just can't.”
Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said Trump's statements that Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is overseeing a lawsuit brought by Trump University students who say they were ripped off, should recuse himself because of his ethnic heritage are “textbook racism.”
“Claiming a person can't do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment,” Ryan said Tuesday, at a Washington press conference to feature his latest anti-poverty plan. “It's absolutely unacceptable.”
Whether the Republican Party will coalesce around the need to pick another nominee is a big and open question. Some Republican National Committee members have said the party's rules allow its national convention delegates to break with results from primaries and caucuses. However, that would have to be the first order of business when the convention convenes in late July.
In the meantime, the question of how far Trump can go before being rejected by the GOP is escalating. Trump knows that disclosures surrounding his predatory business practices as part of the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in California are exceptionally damaging. It is his pattern to ramp up the rhetoric to distract from coverage he dislikes. However, in this case, Trump's racist attacks appear to be crossing a line even among Republicans, who for years have pursued many policies alienating communities of color.
On Tuesday afternoon, apparently bowing to pressure, his campaign On Tuesday afternoon, apparently bowing to pressure, his campaign issued a statement in which Trump did not apologize and again said the judge should be removed, but added he would not be commenting further.
Below is a list of comments from more than a dozen Republicans who have slammed Trump's attacks but not rejected his candidacy. The comments were compiled by the Clinton campaign, which issued a release saying, “While it's striking that so many Republicans have called out their nominee for his attacks on Judge Curiel, many Republicans are continuing to stand by their endorsement of Trump, seemingly unconcerned about the power a President Trump would have to actually nominate judges and justices.”
Coventry boss Mark Robins says he was confused by the decision to book Cyrus Christie for tripping a pitch invader.
After a fan ran onto the pitch in their Johnstone's Paint Trophy northern final first leg 3-0 loss to Crewe, Robins supported the City defender's actions.
"He stopped him in his tracks and waited for the stewards to remove the supporter," Robins told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire.
"To produce a yellow card for that was strange to say the least," he added.
"He's stopped the fan from running all over the place.
"He had better movement than some of our players today."
Two goals from Newcastle United loan man Brad Inman and one from AJ Leitch-Smith at the Ricoh Arena helped Crewe take a three-goal advantage going into next week's second leg.
The Alex will be looking to reach the final of the competition for the first time.
We wanted to choose someone else. We really did. But in the end, Colorado once again produced the best video college sports had to offer in 2015.
Following last year's triumphant “Seasons” epic, Colorado provided a sequel in “Forever” that matched its predecessor in scope and execution. “Forever” successfully and elegantly informs recruits what life will be like when they are Colorado football players while also appealing to the fans who always wished they could be. The cinematography, editing, writing and overall concept are simply a step above the rest of the industry.
The FootballScoop staff would like to issue a congratulation to Jamie Guy and the rest of his staff and Boulder, and another congratulations to the five other finalists – Appalachian State, Clemson, Colorado State, Georgia and Mississippi State – as well the dozens of other entrants.
Now, without further ado, “Forever”…
The Kensington Police Service has surprised its citizens by announcing a decidedly unconventional new punishment for drunk driving. With the holiday season approaching, the department expects to see a rise in drivers getting behind the wheel after consuming alcohol at social events and staff parties. If they catch someone drinking and driving, there will now be an extra punishment on the ride to jail: criminals will be forced to listen to Nickleback in the police cruiser.
The department posted a picture of an unopened copy of Nickleback's Silver Side Up album, and shared their hopes that they wouldn't be forced to open it this holiday season. Silver Side Up was released in 2001; despite massive sales numbers around the world at the time of its release, police believe that few people would choose to listen to the album today.
Some outraged citizens have pushed back against the new punishment. One protested a Canadian police force's defamation of a (supposedly) beloved Canadian band; another claimed that he would attempt to be arrested just to have the pleasure of listening to the album in the cruiser.
Other commenters took a harsher stand against drunk driving, arguing that criminals should be subjected to opera, disco, Justin Bieber, Milli Vanilli, and other polarizing musicians. One pointed out that the punishment is especially ironic because Chad Kroeger, the lead singer of Nickleback, was convicted of driving under the influence after a traffic stop in 2006.
How to stay safe (and Nickleback-free) this holiday season
Fortunately, no one has to endure any unwanted Nickleback this holiday season. Here's how to have fun without getting nabbed for a DUI:
Choose a designated driver . If you must drive to your designation, plan on carpooling, and find someone in your group who's willing to spend the night sober.
. If you must drive to your designation, plan on carpooling, and find someone in your group who's willing to spend the night sober. Call a cab. Yellow taxis, Ubers, Lyfts, and other rideshares will all be out in full force this holiday season. You don't have to get behind the wheel drunk—let someone else get you home.
Yellow taxis, Ubers, Lyfts, and other rideshares will all be out in full force this holiday season. You don't have to get behind the wheel drunk—let someone else get you home. Use public transit . It's not as fast as a cab, but it's much cheaper. Get home on a bus or train instead of driving drunk.
. It's not as fast as a cab, but it's much cheaper. Get home on a bus or train instead of driving drunk. Call someone to pick you up. It's better to plan this in advance, but calling a friend or family member for help is still safer than driving yourself home while you're impaired.
It's better to plan this in advance, but calling a friend or family member for help is still safer than driving yourself home while you're impaired. Get a hotel room. Many hotels are located near nightlife spots. The only way to sober up is time, so if you're still drunk after last call, it's better to rent a hotel room than to try to drive home.
If you have been the victim of a drunk driving accident, call Davis Law Group to learn more about your legal rights and options. If we believe we can help you achieve the best possible outcome for your case, we will meet with you for a free legal consultation.

New Japan Pro Wrestling's roster has grown rapidly in the past few years. With each of the five current factions pushing capacity, which NJPW star could lead a new group into battle?
Credit: NJPW1972 Twitter
NJPW's growing fanbase are enjoying the historic era we are witnessing. IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kazuchika Okada is leading a roster that is wall-to-wall excellence, and the matches being had been reflecting that. Each tournament and each major show builds on the last. It's no wonder so many of us are getting blissfully caught up in the New Japan hype.
As much as we are enjoying the performances, we also want to be there for the company's next major story development. Many new fans missed out on the forming of Los Ingobernables de Japon, which has taken the wrestling world by storm. Naturally, we want something new to come along that we can witness from its inception.
From a locker-room standpoint, it makes sense that a new stable would emerge. Each of the current groups are swollen, with LIJ being one of the few to maintain true exclusivity. Taguchi Japan's open-door policy means any of the part-time fly-ins, such as IWGP Tag Team Champions War Machine, can take part in the faction struggle without committing fully to a team. However, as NJPW becomes a legitimate spot for wrestlers to build their legacy, many will want a more stable group dynamic (excuse the pun).
Speculation has already begun with the ‘Switchblade' promos, but there are also returning Young Lions like Jay White and The Tempura Boyz, who will need homes. CHAOS, Bullet Club and Suzuki-Gun have too many members, so who could help create a new faction for all this incoming talent?

Honda is set for a massive transformation from sensible to sporty, and leading the revolution are three new sports cars, which include a spiritual successor to the S2000 and an all-new NSX.
Like the original Honda S2000, this mid-engined sports car – revealed in our exclusive image - is set to be a coupe rather than a convertible and it will sit in the middle of the three cars.
The Honda S660 with its three-cylinder turbo engine will sit below it, while the the hybrid Honda NSX will be the manufacturer's flagship performance model.
A Honda insider told us about a secret in-house meeting at Honda's Tochigi R&D centre in Japan to discuss the potential for this new mid-sized sports car, which would be part of the world's first-ever mid-engined trio of sports cars from one manufacturer. From what we've heard, there's a strong chance this new Honda S2000 will get the green light.
The Honda S2000 is similar in looks to the S660 and NSX, with all three cars getting sharp lines, a bold grille and narrow headlights giving them a character unlike any of Honda's current models.
Hybrid tech to combine performance and economy
Under the skin of the new Honda S2000, we've been told to expect a revised version of the 2.0-litre 350bhp turbo engine, which will power the next generation Honda Civic Type R.
Some hybrid tech - developed in conjunction with the McLaren Formula 1 team - should also feature and it's set to allow for 0-62mph in around five seconds, but with an economy of around 40mpg.
Honda is looking at adding a simplified version of the all-wheel-drive petrol-electric system used in the NSX.
The mid-size Honda S2000 replacement will be the last of Honda's three new sports cars to arrive and it's expected to go on sale in 2017 for around £35,000. The new Honda NSX is expected to arrive by the first part of 2015, making it the first of the new models to go into production.
The new Honda NSX will be powered by a V6 engine and three electric motors, which develop more than 400bhp. The front wheels get one motor each for the ultimate in torque vectoring. Honda is aiming for a price of around £100,000.
The Honda S660, meanwhile, is first expected to arrive in Japan towards the end of 2015. It'll be powered by a 600cc, 64bhp engine, although a more powerful 1.0-litre turbocharged three-cylinder is rumoured to be on the way for Europe.

MOAR PONIESOk, so i noticed that were holding a contest where you had to draw Dinky with the other Cutie Mark Crusaders....and(looks like someone wanted me to enter...so...um...thank you?glee!), I wanted to draw a pic in that theme as I think Dink would get on great with the other CMC'sI love Derpy in the background there, really pleased with how this turned outMINI STORY TIME:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~What did Dinky do to help the CMC? Hell if I know, this picture doesn't really have a storyline to it ;D If anyone is inspired to write snippets about it then go right ahead. Otherwise, ENJOY THE PICTUREOop, almost forgot, the Cutie Mark Crusaders logo on the capes was vectored by the very awesome and the original is HERE:Thanks AtomicG!
The original Splatoon on Wii U garnered a reputation for being home to some spectacular hand-drawn fan art, posted through Nintendo's Miiverse service. Some Splatoon 2 players are continuing that tradition, even though illustrating on the Nintendo Switch touchscreen isn't as straightforward as it was on the Wii U GamePad.
Splatoon 2 players have managed to find some workarounds, however, that have led to impressively detailed, photorealistic — and heavily meme-inspired — illustrated posts.
Take, for example, this Splatoon 2 fan art of Arms' Helix, recreated pixel by pixel, according to its creator.
THERE. IT TOOK ME OVER A DAY TO MAKE, PIXEL BY FUCKING PIXEL. (also :eyes: @SplatoonSwitch) pic.twitter.com/TlF65uxzIL — bepis (@bepisTM) July 24, 2017
Or this illustration by developer Steve “Fobwashed” Kim, who turned a drawing of ex-Giant Bomb staffer Drew Scanlon (aka “White Guy Blinking”) into commentary about the Splatoon art scene.
(Nice.)
Or this dig at Nintendo's voice chat solution (or lack thereof) for Splatoon 2...
...which blew up on Reddit this weekend as players dove into Splatoon 2.
That post's creator, who goes by Tobi on Twitter, explained the process of recreating the Roll Safe meme in a Splatoon 2 post.
“Those who are wondering, I just used a capacitive stylus for rough shapes, a zoomed in copy of the guy's face in 2-colour mode which I constructed in Photoshop, and a looooooooooot of patience to recreate the face,” Tobi wrote in a reply on r/gaming. “You don't have to be pixel perfect, because the entire thing hinges on visual noise to begin with, but it's nice if the face had some semblance of coherence to it. The clothes and hair are mostly random dots, whose only purpose were to create the illusion of texture and depth.”
Drawing on a Nintendo Switch isn't quite as simple as it was on Wii U. The Switch uses a capacitive touchscreen and — unlike the Wii U GamePad, with its resistive touchscreen — doesn't come with a built-in stylus, so many users simply draw using a fingertip. Others have been slaving over their drawings pixel by pixel; Switch users can use the d-pad and face buttons to paint their pixels one by one on the 320 x 120 canvas.
There's another solution, however, that led to this realistic recreation of Star Wars' Chancellor Palpatine.
That image was “printed” using software written by Shiny Quagsire to trick the Switch into thinking a fighting game controller — specifically Hori's Pokkén Tournament game pad — is attached. The software then turns 1-bit image files input a series of inputs, which are printed left to right. Or, in Shiny Quagsire's own words:
“I repurposed Switch-Fightstick to output a set sequence of inputs to systematically print Splatoon posts. This works by using the smallest size pen and D-pad inputs to plot out each pixel one-by-one.”
Here's what it looks like in-game.
This is just the beginning for Splatoon 2's art scene, so expect more impressive illustrated work to come.
Python Programming, news on the Voidspace Python Projects and all things techie.
Reasons to Love Python
I've been dabbling in C# recently, and I'm afraid I like it. As statically typed languages go it's a good one. However, on coming back to Python I remember how much I like it. It is not just that it is dynamically typed, but it is all the language features that make it concise and expressive.
A programming language is a medium of expression. —Paul Graham
Here are a few of my favourites (in no particular order):
Generator Expressions
Python generators are very cool, and have been around since Python 2.2 (2002). They behave very similarly to the Yield Return introduced in C# 2.0 in 2005.
Also in Python 2.2 were list comprehensions (similar to LINQ over objects introduced in .NET 3.5 in 2007) that allow you to combine a loop and filter in a single expression:
result = [ f ( value ) for value in iterable if value > 0 ]
The expression in the square brackets is evaluated immediately and is identical to:
result = [ ]
for value in iterable :
if value > 0 :
result . append ( f ( value ) )
Python 2.4 (2004) introduced a novel extension to list comprehensions: generator expressions. Generator expressions are similar to list comprehensions, but instead of square brackets they use parentheses.
generator = ( f ( value ) for value in iterable if value > 0 )
The major difference is that instead of being evaluated eagerly they are evaluated lazily. The generator expression returns a generator object that is not executed until you consume it by iterating over it. This means they can be more memory efficient as you can consume individual items from the generator without creating the whole list up front.
One side effect is that they look nicer as the arguments to a function that takes an iterable:
sum ( f ( value ) for value in iterable if value > 0 )
Generators are naturally first class objects that you can pass around your code. David Beazley has an excellent set of slides on using generators for systems programming (and will be giving a tutorial on them at PyCon UK): Generator Tricks for Systems Programmers
One of the examples he gives is a pipeline of generator expressions for parsing Apache log files and summing the amount of data served:
wwwlog = open ( "access-log" )
bytecolumn = ( line . rsplit ( None , 1 ) [ 1 ] for line in wwwlog )
bytes = ( int ( x ) for x in bytecolumn if x != '-' )
print "Total" , sum ( bytes )
None of the generators are consumed until the final call to sum . As it iterates a line at a time (not keeping the log file in memory) it can handle huge log files - and as a bonus it runs faster than a typical solution with loops!
Everything is an Object
Everything in Python is an object (even None ) - functions, classes, methods and modules are all first class objects.
This allows for wonderful programming techniques including higher order functions, factory functions (for classes and functions), creating modules at runtime from databases, meta-programming and so on. It makes testing massively easier and is particularly useful when combined with Python's powerful introspection (inspect any object at runtime to determine its capabilities).
Tuples, Tuple Unpacking and Multiple Return Values
Tuples are one of the built-in container types. Although experts may 'decry' the description, they are effectively immutable lists.
The syntax is straightforward: (1, 2) is a tuple containing two numbers. They can be indexed or iterated over like lists and are a fantastic way of grouping values where otherwise you might create a custom class just to hold a pair of values! They are not unlike the new anonymous types that were introduced along with LINQ in C# - but those you can only use inside the scope where you create them.
Tuples in Python turn up implicitly in a few places, and one of these is where a function or method returns multiple values:
def function ( a , b ) :
return a * b , a - b
The return value from function is a tuple of two values. Being able to return multiple values is enormously useful - especially if you use it with tuple unpacking. Python can 'unpack' tuples in assignment statements:
product , difference = function ( a , b )
It is fair to say that out parameters are only needed in C# because it can't return multiple values (again the alternative is creating a custom class and returning an instance of that instead).
You can also unpack tuples into function calls:
parameters = ( a , b )
product , difference = function ( * parameters )
And the converse is collecting all positional arguments into a tuple (similar to the C# params method signature):
def function ( * args ) :
a , b = args
return a * b , a - b
Keyword Arguments
Another small language feature, but invaluable for creating flexible and usable APIs: keyword arguments with default values.
def function ( arg1 = 3 , arg2 = None , arg3 = 'fish' ) :
. . .
function ( arg1 = 2 )
function ( arg1 = 2 , arg3 = 'nothing' )
function ( 2 , None , 'something' )
Arguments with default values can be called positionally (as normal) or by keyword. This allows you to call a function or method only overriding values that differ from the default.
In fact it is so useful that support for it has been built into IronPython for working with .NET objects. Keyword arguments used in a constructor are the equivalent to constructing the instance and then setting properties afterwards:
form = Form ( Text = "Form Title" )
Decorators
One consequence of first class functions is that 'wrapping' functions (one example of higher order functions) becomes possible. Decorators were introduced to provide a convenient syntax for doing that. I didn't follow the debate as I wasn't interested in the feature and I didn't think I would use it. I was wrong - they turn out to be massively convenient for all sorts of things.
A simple example of wrapping a function (without decorator syntax) for exception handling and logging:
def wrapper ( function ) :
def inner ( * args , ** keywargs ) :
try :
return function ( * args , ** keywargs )
except Exception , e :
logger . log ( "Exception occurred in function '%s': %s" %
( function . __name__ , e ) )
return inner
wrapped = wrapper ( function )
The wrapper function takes a function as an argument. It defines an inner function that calls the original function (keeping a reference to it through a closure) with exception handling and logging. It returns the inner function that can be used in the place of the original. (The *args, **keywargs syntax captures all the positional and keyword arguments that inner is called with and calls function with the same arguments.)
Having created the wrapper function we can actually do the wrapping with the decorator syntax:
@ wrapper
def function ( a , b ) :
. . .
We use this all the time at Resolver Systems - for profiling, mocking out names and 'auto-unmocking' them within the scope of a single function, invoking methods onto control threads and so on.
The Interactive Interpreter
No discussion of useful Python features can be complete without a mention of Python's REPL ; the interactive interpreter.
You can explore new libraries or check out language features in a matter of seconds. You can even do real work from it - Tim Golden (a Python DBA and WMI guru) says that when working with databases he often uses the interactive interpreter and "slurp the data in, transform it, push it back out and walk away".
I've saved the most important (and most controversial) two for almost last:
Explicit Self
Explicit self certainly stirs up some debates. I like it - it makes Python scoping very explicit. When declaring an instance method in a class body, you declare the instance as the first argument to be passed in to the method - and by convention you name this argument self .
class SomeClass ( object ) :
def instance_method ( self , arg1 , arg2 ) :
. . .
The useful thing about this is that you can see at a glance which instance attributes your method is using - they are all prefixed with self .
It also makes calling up to base class methods straightforward and consistent without requiring additional syntax:
class SomeClass ( BaseClass ) :
def instance_method ( self , arg1 , arg2 ) :
BaseClass . instance_method ( self , arg1 , arg2 )
Of course if you really can't cope with the explicit self then you can always use my Selfless Metaclass that uses bytecode hackery to remove the need to declare it.
Indentation Based Block Structure
Some people really don't like this, which to be honest baffles me a bit. Here's what I wrote for the Why Separate Sections by Indentation Instead of by Brackets or End question on the Python wiki:
In order to separate blocks of code (like for loops, if blocks and function definitions) the compiler / interpreter needs something to tell it when a block ends. Curly braces and end statements are perfectly valid ways of providing this information for the compiler. For a human to be able to read the code indentation is a much better way of providing the visual cues about block structure. As indentation also contains all the information for the compiler, to use both would be redundant. As indentation is better for humans, it makes sense to use that for the compiler too. It has the advantage that Python programs tend to be uniformly and consistently indented, removing one hurdle to understanding other people's code. Python does not mandate how you indent (two spaces or four, tabs or spaces - but not both), just that you do it consistently. Those that get used to the Python way of doing things tend to start seeing curly braces as unnecessary line noise that clutters code. On the other hand, 'the whitespace thing' is possibly the single biggest reason why some developers refuse to even try Python.
Interesting to note that both Haskell and F# also allow you to delimit block structure by indentation (plus Python influenced languages like Boo and Cobra).
I haven't even mentioned language features that come as a consequence of being a dynamically typed language: duck typing (protocols instead of interfaces), heterogeneous container types (no need for generics) and many more...
PyCon UK: IronPython Tutorial, Socials and Volunteers Needed
The PyCon UK conference (national UK Python conference) draws inexorably nearer - just over a week to go now. We've currently got over 200 people registered and about 80 for the tutorials so it should be a great conference.
If you're coming, don't forget to register for the social events on the Thursday and Friday evenings:
Today Christian, Menno and I have been working on our IronPython Tutorial. The handout notes and example code are basically done, just a little polishing off to do.
The tutorial is based around a simple Twitter client, which Menno has named Twatter! We've been testing Twatter on Windows, Linux and the Mac (it doesn't look bad on the Mac).
At each step we will be introducing a new topic and explain the principles. We'll give the attendees the skeleton of the code and then assist you to add new functionality. It is a very simple application, but we will manage to cover topics including (all using .NET APIs from IronPython):
Windows Forms
Databases
Web services and network access
Handling XML
Threading
Preparations for the conference itself are going well. We have great sponsorship this year from quite a few companies. Resolver Systems is paying for the drinks on the Saturday night dinner!
What we still need is more volunteers to help with the practical arrangements. We particularly need volunteer Session Chairs who will introduce the speakers and make sure they finish on time! We also need help putting up the signs on the Thursday and Friday. If you can help please sign up on the volunteer wiki pages or email us using the address from the main PyCon UK website.

Armorer's wrench
5 out of 5
Otto Location: Dallas, TX
I had gone to a gun store in Dallas because their web page advertised a wench. They wanted $39.00 for a wrench they had a length of approximately eight inches and was very light. I felt that was not a good value so I got on the internet and searched for a wrench. I found the NcSTAR AR-15 Armorer Wrench Tool for approximately $15.00. A few days latter a box appeared at my door with the wrench. I didn't measure it, but it was about thirteen inches, and was substantially heavy and felt like a real tool. It has all the appropriate cutouts and slots that work with an AR type rifle, it was exactly what I needed. I highly recommend this product.
Minnesota will let health insurers increase their rates by at least 50 percent next year to protect the state's Obamacare health insurance individual market from “collapse,” the state announced Friday.
The announcement came from Minnesota commerce commissioner Mike Rothman, who explained bluntly that the state's individual market was barely staying afloat.
“The Commerce Department pursued every option within its power to avert a collapse this year,” said Rothman. “We succeeded in saving the market for 2017, with only Blue Cross leaving. But the rates insurers are charging will increase significantly to address their expected costs and the loss of federal reinsurance support.”
The increase in premiums for next year will range between 50 percent and a staggering 67 percent. This comes on the heels of an increase of between 14 percent and 49 percent for 2016. After those increases, Rothman warns, the annual growth rate will be completely unsustainable, showing a desperate need for reform. (RELATED: 8 of 10 Obamacare Co-ops Are Likely To Fail This Year)
“Middle-class Minnesotans in particular are being crushed by the heavy burden of these costs. There is a clear and urgent need for reform to protect Minnesota consumers who purchase their own health insurance,” Rothman said at the time.
About five percent of Minnesota residents, roughly 250,000 people, are dependent on the individual market for their health insurance. Obamacare requires all American adults who do not receive health insurance from their employer to either buy individual health insurance or pay a fine. The persistent increases in the price of individual insurance are a sign of a potential “death spiral” in the individual market, as the massive cost increases will likely encourage more people to go without insurance and pay the fine instead, thereby reducing the customer base for insurers and forcing additional rate hikes.
The federal government offers tax credits for the purchase of health insurance on the individual market, but these credits disappear at income of $47,520 for an individual and $97,200 for a family of four.

Consider my headline a little play on words which I'll explain in a moment. Everyone wants to be a bit more productive, more efficient, and save time.
If you slave over a hot keyboard for a few hours a day then you understand why some Mac utilities are worth their weight in, uh, Bitcoin? Let me back up to the basics. Cut, copy, and paste. Those are keyboard shortcuts we learn early on, right?
Has cut, copy, and paste changed much since the original Mac? No. That needs to change, but Apple seems stuck in the 20th century when it comes to such improvements. Look how long it took Apple to get to a two-button mouse?
Take a look at one of my favorite Mac utilities. It's called CopyPaste Pro. It's a multiple clipboard manager. That means anything you cut or copy gets stored in a library so it can be pasted again later without having to find it and copy it again. That is a huge time saver.
Viewing all your clipboards is a click or keyboard shortcut away.
Whatever you've copied or cut to the Mac's clipboard gets saved by CopyPaste Pro so you can paste it in again whenever you want; even if you restart your Mac.
At the most basic level that's what CopyPaste Pro does, but as a mature Mac utility there are many other useful features to help you save the day.
The Clip History even stores drag and drops (in addition to cuts and copy). The Clip Browser is horizontal or vertical, depending on your screen size and what you want to view. You can even drag images from Safari directly into CopyPaste Pro.
The built-in clip editor lets you open clips in PDF, RTF, HTML, Apple's Archive format, text and more– so you can even edit what you saved in the Clip History.
There's much more going on in CopyPaste Pro, but suffice it to say that if you don't have a multiple clipboard manager, this is a good one; one of the best. Try it before you buy it, too. OK, what is ‘plum amazing' about CopyPaste Pro? It's a play on words. The app developer is Plum Amazing.
Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's May-December marriage was on the rocks after just three months, sources exclusively tell Page Six — but the starry couple agreed to give their shaky union a year before calling it quits.
Depp, 52, and Heard, 30, tied the knot in February of last year, but by May it was all but over, we hear. They decided to give themselves “a year” in hopes of patching things up and avoiding the embarrassment of a three-month marriage.
Sources close to the former couple told Page Six that grizzled star Depp quickly grew tired of Heard's enchantment with Hollywood glitz. “Their relationship turned sour almost immediately. She's really young and affected by the industry and ‘the scene' at times,” said an insider, adding, “Don't get me wrong; she's a cool chick, but Johnny doesn't tolerate that.”
We're told Heard's bisexual past also proved a problem. By Heard's birthday in April last year, “she went to meet him to work on damage control,” we're told, because her close friendship with photographer Io Tillett Wright, an activist in the gay and lesbian community, was causing drama in their marriage. We were told back then that Depp “doesn't like Io” and believed they “were spending too much time together for it to be comfortable.” Wright was staying in Depp's guest house and moved out.
“He started making her travel with him,” said an insider of Depp and Heard, “and she started distancing herself from her lesbian friends.”
The debacle with her dogs also helped sink the relationship. During an April 2015 trip to Australia, when Depp was shooting “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,” Heard was infamously charged with illegally bringing along two terriers, Pistol and Boo — a drama that ended with a much-mocked video in which the couple awkwardly apologized. “[It] made him look so stupid and it was her fault,” sniffed another source.
Meanwhile, hard-partying and -working Depp is beginning to show his age. Another insider said, “Amber was like, ‘What am I doing with this old man who used to look like Johnny Depp?' ”

Even in a Senate then controlled by Democrats, President Obama's National Security Adviser, Susan E. Rice, could not be confirmed as his second term Secretary of State. That's because she notoriously went on five Sunday television news talk shows to claim that the September 11, 2012 attack on our diplomatic compound at Benghazi was provoked by an anti-Islamic video. It soon became clear that cover story was false. She was then our Ambassador to the UN.
Now, Amb. Rice is on TV making news again. She told PBS's Charlie Rose that the address by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Congress slated for next week “injected a degree of partisanship” into the U.S.-Israeli alliance that was “destructive to the fabric of the relationship.”
Let's hope Amb. Rice goes on all five Sunday shows again to level that charge. That should certainly build the audience for the Prime Minister's address. She needs a bigger audience than just those insomniac liberals who watch Charlie Rose.
Has there ever been a greater example of swallowing camels while choking on a gnat? The gnat, of course, is the invitation to Netanyahu to address Congress. President Obama's supporters are furious, claiming it is a deliberate attempt by the Israeli leader to stick a spoke in the wheels of the U.S.-Iran negotiations over nuclear weapons. And, the speech to Congress has been dismissed by Mr. Obama's backers as a partisan gesture by Netanyahu just days before Israel's scheduled elections. Campaign operatives who helped Barack Obama win back-to-back victories here are known to be in Israel now, working for Netanyahu's opponents.
If the Obama administration is so confident of the rightness of its position in the U.S.-Iran talks, why should it worry what Mr. Netanyahu thinks? If their position in the talks could clearly command the assent of the American people, President Obama could simply go on national TV and proclaim the final agreement as a victory for “peace in our time.”
This president, as Newsweek editor Evan Thomas famously said, “hovers over the nations like a sort of god.” Surely, President Obama would be more persuasive in selling a nuclear pact with Iran's mullahs than Netanyahu might be in criticizing it. Mr. Obama—in his best professorial style—could simply take apart the Netanyahu speech, one paragraph at a time. He is so eloquent, the seas have ceased to rise at sound of his voice. Or so we were promised.
If Amb. Rice is choking on a gnat—the invitation to Netanyahu, its timing, its location, its appearance of partisanship—then what is the camel we are supposed to swallow? Let's try this:
President Obama and Secretary Kerry are about to conclude an agreement with Iran's mullahs to that will not allow them to develop a nuclear weapon now but will allow them to “phase out” strict limits on their nuclear program . This plan, if inked, and if ratified by the Senate, would permit Iran to move toward a nuclear weapon in the “out years” of the ten-year agreement.
Messers Obama and Kerry are working with an Iranian leadership that seized our embassy in Tehran in 1979. They held our 52 embassy staff hostage for 444 days. They subjected them to beatings and to psychological torture—like frequent mock executions before firing squads. The mullahs hold our embassy property—sovereign U.S. territory under international law—to this day. Messers Obama and Kerry want us to trust the mullahs who murdered 241 U.S. Marines and Navy corpsmen as they slept in their Beirut barracks in 1983. They want us to rely on the good words of mullahs who have equipped Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon with 50,000 missiles to fire at Israel. Our crack negotiators want us to wave away the regular “Death to America” rallies ginned up by the muillahs in Tehran. Their agent, Hezbollah chief Hasan Nasrallah, welcomes the exodus of European Jews arriving in Israel because, as he says, “it will save us the trouble of hunting them down.”
President Obama, Secretary Kerry, and Amb. Rice are not asking us to swallow a camel. They are asking us to swallow a herd of camels. While they fussily object to Prime Minister Netanyahu's address to a joint session of Congress, they are lurching toward an agreement that leaves his country in mortal peril—and very possibly our own nation, too. That is what Netanyahu is likely to explain. Kerry has been wrong on every foreign policy issue of the last forty years. His presence at the negotiating table should give no one confidence.
On one point, however, I can agree with this administration. As a sign of their displeasure, the Obama administration is removing the Vice President from the evening's proceedings during the Prime Minister's speech. President Obama is right to pluck Joe Biden from his customary chair. Just the thought of Netanyahu's presence in the well of the House, and Biden's absence from the chamber, assures that the intelligence of Congress will be doubly enhanced.

When Brad and Molly Nemec's Dodge Durango broke down in downtown Stillwater last month, they called City Hall to explain that it would be stranded overnight.
The Lindstrom, Minn., couple, who rescue Jindu dogs destined for slaughter in Korea, were on their way to pick up six dogs in Wisconsin when their SUV overheated near Teddy Bear Park.
The dogs, flown from Seoul to Chicago, had been picked up at O'Hare International Airport by a friend of Nemec's. The friend planned to meet the Nemecs near the Wisconsin Dells, a halfway point between their home and the Chicago airport.
“We called and asked them not to tow us,” Molly Nemec said. “We were trying to get a rental car, but all the rentals were full because it was the holiday weekend. We needed one large enough to fit six dog kennels.”
Brad Junker, the Stillwater Police Department's community service officer, went to check on the Nemecs about 2 p.m. June 30.
“Their hood was up,” Junker said. “I asked if there was something I could do — if they needed food or if they needed water.”
Molly Nemec started crying as she told Junker their situation.
“She explained that they might be missing their meeting point, and they didn't know what to do,” he said. “They were trying to make contact with some people back in Lindstrom … and they just weren't having any luck.”
Junker, who owns a 2002 Chevrolet Suburban, quickly realized he could help. He went and got it and let them borrow it for their rescue mission.
“I don't know; it just seemed like the thing to do,” Junker said. “I said, ‘Why don't you just take my vehicle? I have to work for another four or five hours. I won't be using it. It's just sitting in the parking lot, so why don't you just use it?' ”
Molly Nemec, 40, an elementary-school counselor, said she couldn't believe his offer. She made him say it twice.
“He said, ‘Sure, just take my vehicle, if that's all you need,'” she said. “He didn't even know us, and that's when he said: ‘I'm going to go and get my Suburban for you to use.' … He was back within eight minutes, and he just handed us the keys.”
Junker warned the Nemecs that a tire was low and the tank was almost empty. They went right to Lucky's Station on North Main Street and “filled it up and put air in the tire, and we're driving on I-94 and we look at each other, and we're, like, ‘What just happened?' ” said Molly Nemec, who volunteers with Ruff Start Rescue in Princeton, Minn.
“My husband said, ‘You know he must have been an angel in disguise,'” she said.
Junker, 47, who lives in Stillwater, said he was moved to learn of the couple's rescue work and knew his daughter, Molly, 18, would be, too. She had just been telling him about the controversial annual Yulin Dog Meat Festival in China, where thousands of dogs are rounded up and slaughtered for food.
“She is the biggest animal lover that you could possibly imagine, and I knew she would just be beside herself if she knew we could help out in some way with this,” Junker said. “I was just delighted that they said they would (use my vehicle). I honestly didn't feel like it was that big of a deal. It just seemed like enough bad things had happened; let's do something right.”
The Nemecs returned Junker's SUV — with a full tank of gas — about 10 that night. Junker and his daughter also got to meet the six dogs — Maple, Monarch, Lilac, Laker, River and Honeycrisp — before they were taken away by their foster families.
“All the fosters got to see him and got to sing his praises,” Nemec said. “He saved the day.” Related Articles Prosecutor: No charges against Stillwater officer who shot reportedly suicidal man

The dogs, which look like a cross between a yellow Labrador and a Siberian husky, are available for adoption through Ruff Start Rescue, Nemec said.
Junker, an eight-year veteran of the police department, is “known for paying things forward,” said Police Chief John Gannaway. “He's very good at that. He just does little things throughout the community that he doesn't get recognition for.”
Nemec wrote a post praising Junker and shared it on the city's Facebook page.
“I have to admit I'm a bit overwhelmed and sort of embarrassed by the attention, when I feel like all I was doing was offering a simple solution to someone who was having a bad day,” Junker said.
“I am number 6 of the seven children raised by Don and Shirley Junker, who showed us time and time again to help out wherever you can — and each of whom would have probably offered the same solution to the Nemecs,” he said. “I am my father's son.”

While millions around the world watch Everton take on Liverpool in the Merseyside derby, local historians are pondering one of the football-mad city's great "what-ifs".
Long before the blue and red rivalry that dominates derby day another team - Liverpool Caledonians FC - were among the city's leading Victorian era clubs.
They took up residence at a 30,000-capacity stadium in Wavertree, known as Woodcroft Park, at a time when Everton had just settled into Goodison Park having previously played at Anfield, later the home of Liverpool FC.
Image copyright Liverpool Post Image caption Liverpool Mercury reported the formation of the club's company in 1892 to take over Woodcroft Park
An appeal has now been made for information about Liverpool Caledonians, with local councillor Tim Beaumont admitting "there does not appear to be a great deal known about them or where they played".
It appears the club, which gained admission to the Lancashire League, didn't last for long.
Local historian Mike Chitty, from the Wavertree Society, says: "They were around in 1891 and they sought entry to the Football League a year later, and they went into liquidation by December 1892 so that was the end of the club."
Despite their short existence, Mr Chitty says they reached the fourth qualifying round of the FA Cup in 1892 - "one round further than Liverpool FC" - before losing to Northwich Victoria.
Mapping mystery
In a Liverpool Mercury report from 1892, the Caledonians were described as being "so successful during [their] first season that, besides being in the semi-final in the Liverpool Senior Cup Competition, [they] won the Liverpool Challenge Shield".
Ultimately their bid for a place in the Football League was unsuccessful.
Their Woodcroft Park stadium was described as "suitable for football and cricket" while a "fast cinder track of a quarter of a mile fits them for cycling and athletic purposes".
It also possessed "perfectly level and well-drained" turf - more than can be said for some current grounds - while reporters enjoyed "ample press conveniences".
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Goodison Park, seen here in 1928, hosted its first Everton match in 1892
Yet the Woodcroft Park stadium doesn't appear on the Ordnance Survey maps published in 1893 and 1905, says Mr Chitty.
"It looks like the football ground had come and gone in between... but other clubs are known to have played on the ground until around 1900 or possibly a bit afterwards," he adds.
According to a Mercury story from 1893, the Liverpool Old Boys club took over the ground from the Caledonians, although it's not clear whether the former was a football or rugby team.
"There may be stories in families about an ancestor who played for [the Caledonians]," says Mr Beaumont. "Or there could be medals or other memorabilia which have been gathering dust in a loft but which could provide valuable information."
The Mercury cuttings say Woodcroft Park was "a minute's walk from Wavertree Station, and within easy distance of Sefton Park, Wavertree, and Fairfield".
Scottish connection?
Attempts to pinpoint the stadium's exact location throw up various possibilities, including a now-demolished country house known as Woodcroft Cottage, and a nearby housing development close to Lawrence Road.
As the team's Roman suffix suggests, they may have had a Scottish link.
"Liverpool was a very cosmopolitan place around 1900," says Mr Chitty.
Image copyright Liverpool post Image caption The Mercury reported the ground had a "good racing track"
"It had drawn people from all over the world but mainly from different corners of the British Isles, being a port.
"Therefore there were very strong communities - Irish, Welsh and Scots - and we assume that Liverpool Caledonians FC was set up to appeal to the ex-pat Scots who lived in Liverpool."
Mr Chitty initially thought a cluster of streets in Wavertree - possibly named after Scottish men with connections to the South African Boer War between 1899 and 1902 - could have been a nod to the Liverpool Caledonians.
But he now believes this could be a red herring.
"As the Caledonian FC was only in existence for a few months - whereas Woodcroft Park continued in use for another eight years or so - would anyone really have remembered the Caledonian connection when choosing to name a set of new streets?"
He adds: "This is the thing about local history - you start off on one thing and it leads you off on all sorts of other things."
Anyone with information is asked to contact the Wavertree Society.
Nearly one year after the demonetization of high-value notes, India's neighbours in the Himalayan region Nepal and Bhutan are still grappling to find a window to exchange old notes. Since Indian currency is a legal tender in both the countries, they are sitting on a huge cache, yet to find a way back to the Reserve Bank of India's lockers.
Talking to a select group of reporters at the Foreign Correspondents Club here, Nepal ambassador Deep Kumar Upadhyaya admitted that despite raising the issue at the highest-level and several rounds of discussions, the issue has eluded a solution. Upadhyaya said that while people living in the border areas had succeeded in exchanging old notes, the poor mostly living in far-off mountains were hit hard.
According to figures released recently, a total of Rs 15.28 lakh crore (Rs 8.58 lakh crore in Rs 500 and Rs 6.86 lakh crore in Rs 1,000 denominations) out Rs 15.44 lakh crore returned to the RBI, leaving only Rs 16,000 crore under speculation. Many believe that huge chunks of this unreturned money is lying in Nepal and Bhutan.
Diplomatic sources here said that since Nepal, right now, is undergoing through different stages of elections, many political parties and leaders are using demonetization as a tool to raise anti-India feelings. There are 32,000 Nepali Gorkha soldiers in addition to 90,000 pensioners enrolled in Indian Army, besides 60 lakh Nepali citizens working across India, sending Rs 3,840 crore remittances annually to their country.
Sources here said the negotiations between Nepal and India have been stagnant as the RBI is not willing to exchange more than Rs 4,500 per person. Nepal has been insisting to raise this amount to Rs 25,000 for each account. Confirming that there were differences, the envoy said his country must be provided with a mechanism.
Upadhyay explained that nearly every family residing in the hilly regions of Nepal has a member employed in some part of India. "There are pensioners, also almost every family has a member in India. During festive seasons, when they return they take money for various needs such as medical... It is our moral obligation. Nepal must get some kind of window," he said.
Also, Nepalese citizens working in India send remittances to their families in Nepal in higher denomination notes. Nepal, a landlocked country, depends on India for trade and supplies.
According to a rough estimate, banned notes worth as much as Rs 3,302 crore are locked in Nepal and Bhutan. But the Ambassador said he cannot confirm to the exact amount as unlike Bhutan, the Nepal Rashtra Bank (NRB) had not called for depositing scrapped money. "The money is lying with individuals, so there are no estimates with our government," he said. Diplomats here believe that an indifference towards attended demonatisation issues of neighbours would hit hard ties with these countries in future.
The RBI had set up a task force headed by the finance ministry and including an official from the external affairs ministry, to find solutions to questions arising from demonetization that had an extra-territorial component. The government sources here say the cautious approach by the RBI owes its concern about the availability of fake Indian currency and possibility of 'black money' travelling from India into Nepal.
Anti-india feel

The German Grand Prix did not deliver the weekend I had hoped for. Leaving Hockenheim with a DNF was not what I had anticipated on the eve of the race, and was especially disappointing after the good results that Williams Martini Racing had delivered in qualifying.
On Saturday, things had looked good as in Q3 there was just one tenth of a second separating us and the Force Indias, so there seemed to be a very good opportunity to score points that would be important for the championship standings.
But the race turned out to be a bit of a frustrating one. After the start I was running down to Turn 6 and, when I hit the brakes, everything was going well. But when I got ready to get back on the throttle at the exit of the hairpin, I felt a jolt in the back.
It was Jolyon Palmer, who had hit my right tyre, and from that moment on I immediately felt something strange as the car was not working as it should.
After a few laps I was already in crisis with my tyres and I could no longer keep the race pace that we had wanted. I dived into the pits hoping that the Renault hit had damaged the tyres, but when I started running with fresh rubber, the grip lasted pretty much as long as on the first set – so I was back in to the same difficult situation.
As I was lapping two to three seconds slower than what I should be doing, it did not make much sense to stay out on the track. So the team decided to call me in for the final time, which was a decision I shared.
Investigations are still ongoing to find out what happened, but I have no doubt that after the contact with Palmer something on the car had stopped working.
It was terrible luck, because unlike at Silverstone, where we had struggled because of the unforeseen weather conditions, at Hockenheim we had much better expectations and were expecting to be able to finish in front of the Force Indias.
The longest calendar
With 21 races this year marking the longest Formula 1 calendar, most people in the paddock have arrived at the summer break with the need to recharge the batteries.
But if I could choose between having this number of races, or testing more, I think I would always rather be going to a track to compete in a grand prix. I guess my opinion is shared by many drivers.
We love competition, and the race is the moment when you really feel all that adrenaline. Tests can be useful, but emotionally they are not the same thing.
Saying that, four races in one month is a lot, especially if you do not get the desired results.
In my case, the August break has come at the right time to help me recharge my batteries and think of a more positive second half of the championship.
I had a very good start to the season, but the month of July did not bring me much luck. In three of the last four races I suffered technical problems, and my position in the championship has suffered.
As a team, we have the goal of fourth place in the constructors' championship, and I think we have everything in our hands to be able to achieve it. We just have to keep working as we do, and I am sure that we will be able to return to the strong results we obtained earlier in the season.
Rule changes
Ahead of the Hockenheim weekend, F1 took some important decisions on the rules front. And, as happens quite often in this sport, there were pros and cons to what happened.
The scrapping of the limits on team radio communications between drivers and the teams helped improve things for fans. We returned to being able to talk freely, and those that watch the sport can follow what happened with greater transparency because there are no more limits on what we can talk about.
Before this change happened, there were often some very interesting race situations but the drivers could not speak freely, and that made things hard to understand.
But I am always sceptical when rules get changed in the middle of the season. And in my case what was decided ahead of the German Grand Prix did not make a big difference.
I got used to the radio silence before Hockenheim, and I started to talk without problems last weekend. But there were also some penalties imposed on drivers in the two races before Germany, so some doubts remain.
My view is it is not ideal to change the rules of a grand prix from one race to the next unless there are good safety grounds.
Enjoying the Olympics
After leaving the German GP, I made my way to Brazil where in a few days the Olympic Games will begin.
It will be an incredible event, and I will not miss the opportunity to breathe the air of this truly global occasion. This break of the Formula 1 world championship will allow me to enjoy the city of Rio, and I will try to feel my support to all Brazilian athletes.
Enjoy the summer, and I will see you all in Belgium.
It was a homecoming of sorts Tuesday as Kevin Glenn donned blue and gold for the first time in about eight years.
"I'm happy," the five-foot-10-inch tall quarterback told reporters Tuesday.
Glenn was traded from the Montreal Alouettes back to his former team Sunday in exchange for a fourth-round draft pick in the 2017 draft. He played with the Bombers between 2004 to 2008 and has since spent time with six different CFL franchises.
"I always got told by my father and Jerry Maslowsky that I was going to end up back here one day before my career was over," Glenn said, mentioning former Bombers executive Maslowsky, who passed away Sept. 4.
"I never thought it would happen, because a lot of times when you leave somewhere ... it's hard to get back there."
Glenn said he is happy to be back, but admitted he didn't think his time in Montreal was finished and the trade took him by surprise.
"I didn't think it was at an end, but this is the CFL and you never what can happen," he said.
Kevin Glenn is back on the practice field with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. 1:46
He joins the Bombers (7-4) in the middle of a six-game winning streak. Glenn said he picked up on how that record has influenced the team's mood during practice Tuesday.
"Just coming into the locker room this morning when the guys are coming in, they're excited, they're alive," he said.
"Sometimes you think that a team that has had six wins is complacent. You get on the practice field and it's not: those guys are flying around.... You've got to give credit to the organization and what they're stressing."
Bombers general manager Kyle Walters said Monday that Glenn will serve as the second-string quarterback — something he seems fine with.
"I'm ready to come in and help the team anyway I can," Glenn said.
'Thought it was a joke'
Defensive back TJ Heath also hit the practice field for the first time Tuesday with his new team.
The Bombers acquired Heath from Toronto in exchange for former quarterback Drew Willy, a first round draft pick in 2017 and a third round pick in 2018.
Heath, who incidentally was just named the CFL top performer of the week, said he was shocked to hear he had been traded Sunday.
"I thought it was a joke," he said.
Heath said he had formed strong bonds with his defensive teammates in Toronto and it was hard to say goodbye.

"In the same way, I created a bond with them, doesn't mean I have to stop bonding with those guys over there," he said.
"Just means I get to bond with a lot more people here and that's the approach I'm going to take. This is my team, this is my home now."
The club reportedly insisted Heath is a part of the deal with Toronto.
"That makes me feel good, somebody thinks highly of me like that," he said, adding he received a warm reception from his new teammates on arrival. "It feels like I'm home. They treat me like I've been here for a while."
Heath was in a serious car crash a few years ago that he says keeps him motivated and focused on the game he loves.
"Nobody even thought I'd be able to play football again, so once I got the opportunity to play football, I made sure that I never took it for granted. I think that's why I work so hard," he said.
"I use that because you never know when [will be] the last time you might step on the field, when the last time you might take your last breath," Heath said.
The Bombers next game is Saturday in Winnipeg against Heath's former team.

Sound personal finance and investing decisions flow from two things: (1) knowing the numbers and knowing ourselves. If we know the numbers but not ourselves, our decisions will look good on a spreadsheet, until our real world decisions deviate from the plan. If we know ourselves but not the numbers, our decisions may feel right, but lead us down the wrong path. So what's the answer? We need to think like Mr. Spock, but act like Captain Kirk. Allow me to explain.
Mr. Spock was a human computer (at least when he wasn't mating). He took in data, processed it and spat out an answer. He could calculate the odds of the outcome of an action to multiple decimal places. Any decision that deviated from his statistical analysis was, in a word, illogical.
And that brings us to Captain Kirk. Kirk was one big ball of energy, emotion and passion. He made decisions based on instinct and gut feeling. He listened to Mr. Spock, but he didn't always follow his advice. He was the yang, Mr. Spock was the yin.
And that brings us back to personal finance and investing. To make sound money decisions, we need to know the hard, cold numbers like Mr. Spock, and we need to know our own emotions and human nature like Captain Kirk. To show you what I mean, let's apply this way of thinking to some real life money decisions many of us have or will face:
Buying versus renting a home
There's been a lot of discussion lately about whether it is best to buy or rent. A few years ago, home buyers were king of the hill. Today, as the market declines, renters are grinning like a Cheshire Cat. When the market eventually improves, homeowners will be back on top, and the cycle will repeat itself. So how should this decision be made?
The Numbers: Crunching the numbers on renting versus buying is not an exact science. In addition to considering the interest rate, maintenance costs, insurance, and taxes consequences, you have to make the best guess at future rent increases and home prices. Fortunately, online calculators make this analysis easier. Here is one of my favorite rent versus buy calculators. Once you've figured out the numbers, there's still more to consider before making a decision.
The Decision: One significant benefit that renting sometimes offers comes from investing the money you save from avoiding a higher mortgage. If you lack the discipline to invest the difference, however, buying may be the better choice even if the numbers say otherwise. Buying can “force” you to save each month as you pay down the loan and as the value of your home goes up. If the numbers support buying a home, renting could still be the best choice if you will be tempted to use your home equity like an ATM machine. Constantly refinancing and taking money out of the home to finance vacations, cars and other purchases can quickly erode the benefit of buying. This is a perfect example of the importance of knowing ourselves, not just the numbers.
Paying down debt or investing
I reader recently asked me this question: Should he borrow from his home equity line of credit to invest in the stock market. A related question we often face is whether to use extra cash to pay off debt or to invest.
The Numbers: The question here is whether the returns from the investment will exceed the cost of the debt. To answer that question, we'll need to make some assumptions about future returns, which is always a dangerous business. We”ll also need to consider whether any of the interest we pay is tax deductible. If it is, we'll need to reduce the interest rate by the tax benefit before making the comparison. For example, a 7% home equity line of credit that's tax deductible becomes 4.9% assuming a 30% tax rate at the margin (interest rate * (1 – tax rate) or 7% * 70%). So if we also assume an 8% return on our investment in a Roth IRA, the numbers tell us to invest the excess cash rather than pay down the debt. Note that if the investment were in a taxable account, we also would need to reduce the investment returns by our expected tax bill. If we assume 15% long-term capital gains, the 8% before tax return still beats the 4.9% effective rate on the line of credit (8% * 85% or 6.8%).
The Decision: There are many factors beyond just the numbers to consider here. For example, consider whether you are disciplined enough to pay down your debt without borrowing more money. I know some who have decided to pay down their debt before investing, but then get caught in the cycle of paying down debt–borrowing–paying down debt–borrowing–repeat until broke. The result is that they never invest. For some (like our government), the best cure for deficit spending is not to have any available credit. I'm not suggesting, of course, that we run out and max out our credit cards. But for somebody who has trouble controlling their spending, waiting until their debt is paid off to begin saving may mean they never save.
A second important factor to consider is risk. While over the long run stock investments may beat the 4.9% effective rate on a line of credit, the investment comes with more risk. The 4.9% return from paying down your debt is guaranteed. The stock market guarantees nothing. And over the short term, the risks in the stock market are even greater. It's because of this factor that I never borrow to invest in the stock market.
Which debt to pay off first
The Numbers: This one seems easy–pay off the debt with the highest interest rate first. Of course, as with the example above, we'll need to consider taxes if any of our interest is tax deductible. After considering the tax, paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first will retire our debt in the shortest time for the least amount of money. Spock would be proud.
The Decision: There are at least two other factors to consider. First, many (like Dave Ramsey) suggest paying off the debt with the lowest balance first, regardless of the interest rate. Why? It will motivate many people because it will allow them to achieve some successes early on in the process of debt reduction. If you pay the highest interest debt first and it happens to be a large balance, it could take years before your first debt is paid off. Also, paying off a loan frees up additional cash flow, although if it's all going to debt reduction anyway, this factor seems less important.
Second, it's important to consider whether the loan is revolving credit (e.g., credit cards and home equity lines) or an installment loan (e.g., car or school loans). Why is this important? Two reasons. First, if you are concerned that you'll be tempted to charge more as the balance goes down, it may make sense to focus on installment loans first. You can't run up your car loan after you've paid it down. Second, if you're concerned about having available credit during an emergency, paying off revolving debt may be the best place to start. That's what I do. My main debt is on a home equity line of credit, and I pay it off rather than my school loan so that I have available credit if I need it. Yes, a cash emergency fund is best. But reality doesn't always cooperate with what's best.
Invest in a traditional or Roth 401(k) or IRA
The Numbers: I recently wrote a lengthy article called The Ultimate Guide to Traditional and Roth 401(k) and IRA Retirement Accounts. A section of the article describes whether it's best to invest in traditional or Roth retirement accounts, and for the numbers, you can check out this Traditional versus Roth 401(k) calculator. The calculation requires an assumption about your tax rates in retirement, although most assumptions favor the Roth over a traditional account. Why? Let's go to the decision.
The Decision: Let's assume you max out your 401(k) contribution at $15,500 ($20,500 for those 50 or better). With a traditional 401(k) you'll save the income tax on this contribution up front. Assuming 30% tax rate, you'll pocket $4,650. With a Roth, you'll pay that tax now, but won't pay tax when you withdrawal the funds during retirement. Here's the question: what will you do with the $4,650 you save in taxes if you invest in a traditional 401(k)? If you don't invest it, the Roth is the best choice because it in effect forces you to “invest” it. This is where being honest with ourselves before we make a financial decision can make all the difference.
OOooo–oooOO
Personal finance and investing decisions are not one-size-fits-all. While it is critical to know the numbers before making a decision, we can't live life in a spreadsheet. Understanding our own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to money, and making decisions in light of them, will help us make the right financial decisions for ourselves.
And as a parting note, here is a great montage of Mr. Spock and Captain James T. Kirk:
May you live long and prosper.

RADIOACTIVE NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL -- WHERE AND HOW?
Danger of Nuclear Power -- Whether or not we ever build another nuclear power plant, the fact is that at present we have literally millions of tons of low, medium, and high-level radioactive waste scattered all around our country in hundreds of dump sites, with no plan for final disposal of all that dangerous waste. The containers and storage pits are gradually and steadily corroding; radioactive isotopes are already showing up in the local groundwater in several parts of our country. Over time, this problem is only getting worse, not better.
Consequences -- If we don't find a provably safe, secure, permanent and affordable solution to this problem in the next several years, our children and grandchildren will later pay a mortal price for our negligence. Thirty-five nuclear power countries around the world have an identical problem: millions of tons of dangerous, radioactive nuclear waste, and no plan in sight for its ultimate, final disposal.
Our Proposal -- Here at North Star, we firmly believe that we have discovered and created a thoroughly effective solution to that problem. We believe our proposal is elegantly simple and direct, and ecologically pure in its details. It consists of two critical and unique elements: a strong, safe container, and a provably safe disposal site.
The North Star container (patent pending) is made of UHP (ultra high performance) concrete, designed to withstand pressure above twenty tons per square inch, compressive strength. Our disposal site is deep within the sediment layer of the deep trenches of the subduction zones of the world's oceans. These two elements -- a strong, safe container and a safe disposal site -- used in concert, provide a solution to the problem of radioactive hazardous waste disposal in a manner that is provably "safe, secure, permanent and affordable" for countless generations into the future. Go to our company web site for further information and details: www.nukewastedisposal.com.
The Results --
North Star is launching this fund raiser in order to proceed to the next stage in the realization of our plans. With the success of this fund raising campaign, we will be able to hire about ten or fifteen top-level scientists from a half-dozen special fields of science, including the fields of nuclear energy, nuclear waste handling and transportation, oceanography, plate tectonics, cement engineering, and other related sciences and industries. We will commission each of a to write a well-documented, five or ten-page paper validating the main points of our research. Then, based on our own research and their language, their data, and their national and international reputations, North Star's research and proposal will have positive credibility with other scientists, nuclear power industry leaders, and national political leaders.
These leaders will then be able to take the necessary practical and legal steps to enable us to put our proposal into practice, and actually dispose of all our radioactive nuclear waste, forever. With their support, the general public will see, understand and believe in our proposal for the "safe, secure, permanent and affordable" disposal of all our dangerous radioactive waste. With your active financial support, we will make all this happens in the near future. Go to our company web site for further information and details: www.nukewastedisposal.com.
Like it or not, Avicii is running things right now. He's killing it on Billboard, with his True making actual history for EDM acts. He's a beast when it comes to marketing himself, aligning with a number of brands and further lining his pockets. He makes the kind of EDM that people who had EDM cringe at, and if you're new to dance music and detest Avicii's sound, you might end up writing off an entire scene without doing much digging. While DAD respects Avicii's work, and hold a number of his productions in high regard, we definitely understand if you dislike his material. In light of that, we felt the need to give you, the Avicii-hating consumer, some viable options in terms of the electro house/EDM sound. Some are names you should be familiar with, others are ones you might need to get to know. Don't abandon the EDM scene just because you don't rock with Avicii - try some of these options out!

It's not possible to say too much about who or what she's playing, but she is going to challenge the Doctor in very unexpected ways.
Maisie has already found global fame and is renowned for her role as Arya Stark in the international fantasy drama series Game of Thrones. She also starred in the one-off docu-drama Cyberbully and was cast as one of the leads of Carol Morley's drama The Falling. As well as being a three-time Screen Actors Guild Awards nominee, in February of this year she was awarded with a Shooting Star Award at the Berlin Film Festival.
On her first day on set, Maisie Williams said: “I'm so excited to be working on Doctor Who as it's such a big and important part of British Culture. I can't wait to meet the cast and crew and start filming, especially as we'll be shooting not too far from my home town.”
Steven Moffat, lead writer and Executive Producer, added: “We're thrilled to have Maisie Williams joining us on Doctor Who. It's not possible to say too much about who or what she's playing, but she is going to challenge the Doctor in very unexpected ways. This time he might just be out of his depth, and we know Maisie is going to give him exactly the right sort of hell.”
Bursting with drama, wit and heart, the show continues filming with two period adventures - The Girl Who Died written by Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, and The Woman Who Lived by Catherine Tregenna. Starring Peter Capaldi (The Doctor) and Jenna Coleman (Clara Oswald), the duo continue to time travel through epic adventures directed by Ed Bazalgette (BBC One's 18th-century drama Poldark).
Comedian and actor Rufus Hound, who recently appeared in the series Cucumber, also joins the guest cast alongside BBC Three's Siblings and CBBC's Horrible Histories star Tom Stourton, Ariyon Bakare, Simon Lipkin, Ian Conningham, Murray McArthur, Barnaby Kay, John Voce, and Struan Rodger.
Doctor Who has had a decade of success since its re-launch and is one of BBC One's most highly regarded dramas. The much-loved brand is already a phenomenon delivering on a global scale, with the last series' (series 8) consolidated average at 7.4 million.
The BBC Cymru Wales-produced drama will return to BBC One this autumn with further casting to be announced in due course.

The oil market is well supplied, with inventories at record levels globally, and the market continues "to be a bit soft," but prices are getting a big boost from the dollar's fall, Exxon Mobil CEO and Chairman Rex Tillerson told CNBC Friday.
"Inventory levels are at historic highs levels — especially in the U.S.," Tillerson said. But "a foreign exchange effect" is keeping prices higher, despite the amount of oil available.
"If you put the price of oil, which is priced in dollars around the world, and if you look at what some of the currency effects are with the weak dollar — in our view that is contributing about $20-25 a barrel to the price," he said.
The weakness in the dollar is one of the key reasons for this year's move higher in commodities, analysts told Reuters. The greenback's weakness makes dollar-priced commodities like oil and gold more attractive as a physical hedge for investors, analysts said.
Analysts told CNBC higher oil prices and a weaker dollar could affect the global economy's fragile recovery.
Because this is a story about Loudon Wainwright III and his new album, Haven't Got the Blues (Yet), it seems appropriate to begin by writing about myself. After all, Wainwright was oversharing on his albums years before Mark Zuckerberg was invented, much less Facebook. His career is a case study in how personal minutiae can translate on a universal scale — or at least among a small but committed cadre of followers.
So here goes: I became a Wainwright fan in my late twenties, gravitating to his first four albums, released between 1970 and '73, which, coincidentally, Wainwright made when he was around the same age. The first songs of his that I remember hearing were “The Swimming Song,” which is either a straightforward narrative about learning how to swim over the course of several summers or a metaphor for growing up; and “Motel Blues,” which is definitely about how a semi-but-not-really-famous folksinger turns into a groupie-hunting dog once he exits the stage.
For a student like me of '70s-era singer-songwriters, Wainwright was a rare find — like Randy Newman but more autobiographical, or Townes Van Zandt but funnier and more Northeastern. As I delved deeper into Wainwright's discography, my connection to the guy in his songs deepened. I came to view him as a kind of confidant, a person who understood the worst aspects of my personality because he was at least as bad as I was. Wainwright was a strikingly ordinary guy — on his album covers he resembled the preppy, suburban family-man archetype, though his songs always pointed to a deeper rot beneath the facade. He wrote about getting married, having kids, getting divorced, trying to raise his kids as a somewhat reluctant dad, and getting older. Always getting older.
Wainwright sang about drinking a lot on his early records, and sometimes it was like a joke, but often there were hints that this behavior made him a not-good person. I still think a lot about “Red Guitar” (from 1972's Album III), where he drunkenly smashes a guitar in the fireplace (“as Peter Townshend might”) in front of his horrified, tearful wife. When he sings, “Kate, she says, ‘You are a fool, you've done a foolish thing,'” you feel ashamed for him. You may even feel ashamed for yourself, for reasons not appropriate to expound on at this time.
When I phoned Wainwright a few months ago, I told him all of this — how his albums guided me from my immature bachelor years to the beginning of my marriage and real adulthood, and how I'd recommend that anybody go through that transition seek out those records, like new parents finding solace in Ferber and Dr. Spock. Unsurprisingly, this provoked Wainwright's acidic, self-deprecating streak.
“Gee, well, that's good to hear,” he said, laughing. “I have wisdom and stupidity which [people] can relate to. I mean, I express my own stupidity and that makes them feel a little more comfortable.”
Wainwright, who turned 68 last week, is obviously in a much different place in his life now from when he was when I first discovered him. The day before we talked, he was filming an indie movie with Gabriel Byrne and Nathan Lane. Wainwright occasionally pops up in movies and on television as a senior, wizened authority figure. Longtime fan Judd Apatow cast him as a priest in The 40-Year-Old Virgin and a doctor in Knocked Up. (Wainwright was also a regular on Apatow's short-lived, early-'00s Fox TV series Undeclared). You might have also seen him play a sheriff on Person of Interest, but probably not. (“I got to carry a gun!” he enthused.)
As for Wainwright's day job, instead of writing about early adulthood, he's now confronting the realities of living a life with nearly seven decades in the rearview mirror. Wainwright irreverently describes Haven't Got the Blues (Yet) as an album about “death, decay, depression, and alternate street parking.” It's a companion album of sorts to Wainwright's great 2012 LP, Older Than My Old Man Now, which was about just death and decay, as well as his relationship with his deceased father, Loudon II, a former columnist for Life magazine. Not that these are necessarily new topics for Wainwright — his first album, Album I, opens with a song reflecting ruefully on his immediate past (“School Days”) followed by a song ruminating irreverently on death (“Hospital Lady”).
How often does he think about death? “Every day. How about that?” he said. “Not all day long, but I'm aware of my mortality and have been for a long time. So that stuff is in the records and has been in the records for a long time. My goal is not to bum the audience out — I don't want to bring them down — but I happen to think that they're thinking about it, too.”
Blues' “death and decay” theme occasionally takes the form of morbid story songs (like “The Morgue,” in which the narrator gloats over the body of a former lover) and even social commentary (like the gun control ode “I'll Be Killing You This Christmas,” written after Newtown). But mostly Wainwright does what he's always done, taking the facts of his life and plugging them into his songs, to sometimes excruciatingly sad effect.
One of the album's most moving songs is “I Knew Your Mother,” written for Wainwright's late ex-wife, the folk singer Kate McGarrigle (the same Kate from “Red Guitar”), who died in 2010. The song is written with affection, but there's also a strong dose of self-recrimination: “Having a father is the most dangerous game / And when dad takes a powder it's more than a shame / But I knew your mother and your mother knew me / And as long as it lasted was how long it could be.”
Given how closely Wainwright's art hews to his life, it seems like it would be impossible for him to ever be fully present in his daily existence. On some level, the songwriter is always observing. Rufus Wainwright, Loudon's more commercially successful and occasionally estranged singer-songwriter son, once claimed to “never have known a more tormented artist” than his father. Loudon, however, disputes this.
“I will admit to bouts of depression and you know, being blue,” he said. “Maybe in the context of being the grumpy, distant, absent father I would appear to be a little more tormented. I was gone for Rufus's life a lot. When he was 3, his mother moved him and our recently born daughter Martha back up to Montreal. So then I became like a part-time father, and so maybe it seemed to him like I was tortured because I wasn't around a lot.”
From a creative perspective, Wainwright has arguably never been in a better place. While he likens songwriting to sex — “I don't do it as much, but it's still fun when it happens” — his output lately speaks to a resurgence. Not only have there been a lot of albums, with one coming nearly every other year since 2005's Here Come the Choppers, but they've also covered a lot of ground, including soundtracks, tribute albums, and protest records. And he can still write bittersweet gut-punches that linger in your mind and heart for years afterward.
“Writing songs is not particularly therapeutic. I'm not working things out by writing songs. But I'm focusing on a part of my life, which is the way that I feel. And sometimes I feel like shit. Like a lot of people,” he said. “I've been writing songs for, I don't know, 45, almost 50 years now. So it's hard to know how that mechanism started. I guess like everybody else I started to write songs to get people to pay attention to me, maybe get laid. But I've always chronicled what's going on in my life, and I continue to do that.”

Kevin Mirallas is gutted Everton blocked his return to Olympiakos.
Mirallas wanted to rejoin the Greek side - despite signing a new three-year deal at Everton in May - because he has not been a regular starter under Ronald Koeman this season.
But the Blues rejected Olympiakos' loan offer and they would only have considered a permanent cash deal for the Belgium midfielder.
Mirallas, 29, is deeply disappointed to be denied the move and insists he will return to the Athens side one day.

Mirallas played for Olympiakos for one year before joining Everton in 2012 and told Belgian website DHnet.be : “I really wanted to join Olympiakos. I'm really sad. Everton didn't want to let me go.
“I would like to thank all Olympiakos supporters for the many messages they sent me.
“And they must know that I love their club and, as I said before, one day I will come back to them.”
Mirallas faces a fight to win back his place at Everton and Koeman dropped him completely from his squad for their last game at Chelsea, questioning his attitude.

OLYMPIA — The Washington State House of Representatives today approved a bill to reduce youth access to vapor products with a bipartisan vote of 74-20. The state Senate had previously passed the legislation — which combined multiple proposals, including agency request legislation from Attorney General Bob Ferguson and Governor Jay Inslee, as well as a bill introduced by Sen. Bruce Dammeier (R-Puyallup) — in a 37-6 vote.
Senate Bill 6328 now heads to the Governor's desk, where it is expected to be signed into law.
“This bill is an important step in protecting our kids from a largely unregulated industry,” Ferguson said upon passage in the Senate yesterday. “By increasing enforcement and labeling requirements, we increase public safety and empower consumers to make informed decisions on what they consume.”
Further details about the legislation are available in the Attorney General's Office's media release issued following the Senate vote.
Ferguson reiterated his thanks to the coalition of advocates and lawmakers whose work made today's legislation possible: Gov. Inslee, Secretary of Health John Wiesman, the American Cancer Society, Rep. Gerry Pollet (D-Seattle), Sen. David Frockt (D-Seattle), Sen. Dammeier, Rep. Eileen Cody (D-Seattle), Sen. Annette Cleveland (D-Vancouver) and Rep. Paul Harris (R-Vancouver).
Legislative Affairs Director Mike Webb and Assistant Attorneys General Rusty Fallis and Janis Snoey worked to draft the original agency request legislation and craft the final bill passed today.

White House senior adviser Jared Kushner. (Jim Bourg/Reuters)
“Back channels” have been used by every modern president, from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama. If that's so, what's the problem with the pre-inauguration contacts between White House adviser Jared Kushner and two Russian intermediaries?
It's a fair question. But that doesn't mean that the right answer is a reflexive approval of Kushner's contacts, as offered Sunday by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who said of such offline communication: “It's both normal, in my opinion, and acceptable.”
The devil here, as in most things, is in the details. Most analysts agree that it's appropriate for presidents and their senior aides to use secret contacts to advance U.S. foreign policy goals. And it's fairly routine for incoming administrations to have get-acquainted talks with foreign governments, too. Such back channels can add stability and predictability in foreign relations.
What's not okay is when an incoming administration seeks to undermine the policies of the incumbent. We have “one president at a time.” That's not just a political truism but a matter of law, enunciated back in 1799 in the Logan Act, which prohibits private meddling with official policy during a dispute. The fact that this statute has never been enforced criminally doesn't blunt its importance.
[Many think this law is obsolete. It could actually be a big problem for Trump.]
And it's not okay, either, for any citizen, even the son-in-law of the president-elect, to propose contacts that would use the communications tools of a foreign intelligence service to evade detection. As Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said Sunday: “You have to ask, well, who are they hiding the conversation from?”
The secret Kushner contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and Kremlin-friendly banker Sergey Gorkov raise similar questions to Michael Flynn's contacts with Kislyak. Flynn resigned as national security adviser in February after it was revealed that he had misled Vice President Pence and the public about whether, in a Dec. 29 conversation with Kislyak, he discussed easing anti-Russia sanctions after Trump's inauguration.
The reason that Flynn's conversations were “problematic,” in the words of former acting attorney general Sally Yates, was that they might have undermined the penalties the Obama administration had imposed that very day against Russia for hacking the 2016 presidential election.
Did any of Kushner's conversations have a similar effect of undermining existing policy? That's one of the questions investigators will explore. Published reports have said that Kushner wanted to discuss better coordination with Russia of U.S. policy toward Syria. Did those contacts help frustrate the efforts of then-Secretary of State John F. Kerry to reach a peaceful transition in Syria? Again, a question worth asking.
One difference between the Kushner and Flynn cases is that when press reports surfaced about Kushner's Russia contacts, he doesn't appear to have provided misleading information, as Flynn allegedly did to Pence and the public.
The basics of the Kushner case were reported in late March, by the New York Times and in my column. I wrote then: “Kushner's Russia problem was that he met after the election not just with … Kislyak but also with … Gorkov, who was prepared to act as an intermediary to President Vladimir Putin.” I noted that Kushner had agreed to testify to the Senate Intelligence Committee about the meetings.
I speculated that when Kushner testified, he would “tell the Senate that he wanted to explore opening a discreet channel to Putin, similar to those he established with numerous other global leaders during the transition. But after the secretary of state nomination went to Rex Tillerson, a genuine friend of Putin, Kushner apparently concluded Trump didn't need any such back channel.” Kushner still hasn't testified, and we don't yet know the whole story, but the basic template has been evident for two months.
The reason back channels sometimes make sense is that it's hard to explore options under a public spotlight. The Soviets sent a spy to meet Robert Kennedy before the 1961 inauguration to get a sense of JFK, according to historian Tim Naftali in Slate. President Kennedy used his brother for discreet contacts with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin during the Cuban missile crisis, partly because JFK didn't want his advisers to know what trade-offs he was considering. President Richard Nixon and his top adviser Henry Kissinger used back channels so often and widely that they became habitual.
The Obama administration continued this pattern: Obama explored options with Iran through an Omani intermediary, and used a similar, secret channel to begin discussions with Cuba about the normalization of relations.
These crisis contacts are powerful, but potentially destabilizing. That's why they're left, by law, to official representatives of the U.S. government.
It's no secret that the St. Louis Cardinals have a pretty good team this year. Their 59-34 record is easily the best in baseball, as are their 98.8% playoff odds. Yet, for all that's right with the Cardinals, there's been one gaping hole in their lineup of late: first base.
Since Matt Adams‘ season came to an end when he tore his quad in late May, the Cardinals have had a tough time filling the left void at first base. Most of the plate appearances have fallen to Mark Reynolds, who's managed just an unspectacular 95 wRC+ from the position. Xavier Scruggs and Dan Johnson have also kicked in a combined 46 plate appearances of sub-80 wRC+ work.
To help sure up their first-base situation, the Cards called up prospect Stephen Piscotty, who was hitting a strong .272/.366/.475 in Triple-A Memphis. Although the Cardinals have mostly deployed him as an outfielder in the minors, the plan appears to be for him to slot in at first base for the time being. Unlike many of the guys who have gotten the call over the past couple of months, Piscotty's not a consensus top-tier prospect. Although he did manage to crack the top 50 in both Baseball Prospectus' and John Sickels' mid-season lists. Our very own Kiley McDaniel had him 81st in the preseason.
Piscotty's been an intriguing offensive prospect for a few years now. The Cardinals took him with the 36th overall pick from Stanford in 2012, and he immediately began to prove his mettle in the low minors. He closed out his draft year by hitting .295/.376/.448 in the Low-A Midwest League, on the strength of modest power and an excellent 11% strikeout rate. He performed similarly the following year, splitting time between High-A and Double-A. Once again, he struck out in a mere 10% of his plate appearances, and sprinkled in a bit of power. He also complemented his .295/.355/.464 batting linewith decent speed by swiping 11 bases in his age-22 campaign.
Piscotty opened 2014 at the Triple-A level, and many expected he'd find his way onto the Cardinals roster by year's end. He never got the call, however, as Piscotty's bat sputtered in his first taste of Triple-A. He made his usual amount of contact, but stopped hitting the ball with any sort of authority. He posted an isolated power of .118, down from .152 and .169 in his first two seasons. Piscotty's .288/.355/.406 batting line looked good at first glance, but was merely average fot the hitter-friendly the Pacific Coast League. Not very exciting coming from a corner outfielder. As a result, the Cardinals passed over Piscotty for Randall Grichuk and the late Oscar Taveras when they needed outfield help last year.
Piscotty returned to Triple-A this season, where he rediscovered his power stroke — and then some. With 41 extra base hits, Piscotty matched his total from all of last season, despite playing less than two-thirds as many games. His .203 ISO is easily his best mark as a pro.
His power outburst has coincided with a spike in his walk rate. He's walked in over 12% of his trips to the plate this season, compared to less than 8% last year. The increase likely had something to do with pitchers beginning to pitch him with caution given his newfound pop.
Piscotty's power surge wasn't completely unexpected. At 6-3, 210 pounds, he always had a good deal of strength, which is why Kiley McDaniel pegged him for 55 raw power in the offseason. However, prior to this year, Piscotty had trouble getting that power into games. Despite his above-average raw power, Kiley slapped a 35 on his game power heading into the year. Still, he projected Piscotty for 50 in-game power down the road, which equates to 15-18 homers per year.
According to Kiley, Piscotty is incorporating a bit more loft in his swing path this year, which explains why his power is finally showing up in games. And according to Piscotty himself, this change hasn't occurred by chance. It's the result of a conscious effort to hit the ball with more authority, per a recent interview with Derrick Goold of the St. Louis Post Dispatch:
“My goal for each game has really changed,” Piscotty said. “I was really bogged down with hitting for average and getting hits even if they were weak hits. Now, my focus is getting extra-base hits. There are going to be some more strikeouts and that's part of hitting for power. But I'm piling up the walks. I can see hints of things coming together.”
Piscotty's right that his power and walks have come with more strikeouts. His strikeout rate has ticked up from 11% to 17% between this year and last.
However, these strikeouts have been outweighed by the other changes, causing his wRC+ to improve from 100 to 125. Piscotty has improved, but he's also grown a year older, causing his KATOH forecast to tick down from 3.9 to 3.5 WAR through age-28. As a result, he dropped from 113th to 130th in KATOH's preseason rankings. But even after this slight downgrade, KATOH still thinks Piscotty's an intriguing prospect.
It's worth noting, however, that Piscotty's improvements have also come with a substantial drop in his zone contact rate, which is often a bellwether for a smooth transition to the big leagues. He made contact on an impressive 90% of swings in the strike zone, according to Minor League Central. But as of June 18th of this year, when MLC stopped updating due to technical difficulties, his zone contact rate was just 78%. On average, a guy with a 90% contact rate (2014 Piscotty) can be expected to undershoot his Triple-A wOBA by .050 points, while a guy with a 78% clip (2015 Piscotty) will undershoot by closer to .075.
Let's get some comps up in here. Using league-adjusted, regressed stats, along with age, I calculated the Mahalanobis Distance between Piscotty's performance and every Triple-A season since 1990 in which a batter recorded at least 400 plate appearances. Below, you'll find a list of historical players whose performances were nearest and dearest to Piscotty's, ranked from most to least similar.
*Batters who have yet to play their age-28 season.
And here's a list containing only players who were primarily outfielders in Triple-A, just like Piscotty was.
*Batters who have yet to play their age-28 season.
As always, there are quite a few flops among Piscotty's comps. But there are also some powerful hitters mixed in. Although they peaked rather early, Carlos Quentin, Trot Nixon and Craig Monroe were all productive corner outfielders for a time. Matt Stairs was too, although he didn't really get a chance to play until his age-29 season. These players represent reasonable upsides for Piscotty, assuming his power sticks around.
On the defensive side of things, both the scouting reports and the data suggest that Piscotty's more than adequate in an outfield corner. On the strength of his fringe-average speed and plus arm, he's been 13 runs better than average according to Baseball Prospectus' minor league FRAA numbers, with most of that coming from right field.
For now, however, Piscotty figures to play most of his games at first base, which is a very new position for him. Piscotty was a third baseman in college, where he also dabbled at first, but that was three years ago now. Since his pro debut in 2012, he's played a total of six games at first, with all of them coming this year. So there might be a bit of a learning curve there. First base may be at the very low end of the defensive spectrum, but that doesn't mean it's an easy position to master, especially for someone with so little recent experience. Tell 'em, Wash.
(Hat tip to MLB.com for the GIF)
There's plenty to like about Piscotty's game. He doesn't strike out much, draws walks, and is finally starting to hit for power. As a corner bat, Piscotty will need to do a lot offensively to stick as a regular. But given his minor league track record, it appears he may have enough offensive talent to pull it off.
Steamer forecasts Piscotty for an 88 wRC+ from here on out, which would put him in the neighborhood of replacement level given his defensive limitations. This projection feels a tad low given Piscotty's Triple-A numbers; but might still be an upgrade over the remains of Mark Reynolds. And if Piscotty's newfound power proves to be real, he could easily be a league average — or better — hitter right away, giving the Cardinals could have yet another potent bat in their lineup.
Making Waves in “EX” History: Returning to the CNE Waterfront
By: Cameron Gallant
Last summer's Pan Am Games definitely left their mark on this city and one of those marks has had a special impact on the CNE. Thanks to the $5.5 million infrastructure investment made by the City of Toronto and the Province of Ontario, major repairs were made to the West Channel for the waterfront events, and now the CNE is making an incredible return to the waterfront after decades without. With daily shows, and competitions on both the national and international level, the 2016 fair definitely isn't one to miss. Come be a part of the beginning of a new era in CNE history!
To get you all excited for what's to come at the CNE waterfront, I took to the archives to find some photos of previous CNE shows on the lake. Check them out below!
[1962] I couldn't even water ski on my own, let alone carry someone while on the water!
[1959] Just a few squirrel friends hangin' out and having a good time water skiing.
[1962] A fancy float ready to pass by the cheering CNE crowds.

For years, scientists have thought a bow “shock” formed ahead of our solar system's heliosphere as it moved through interstellar space – similar to the sonic boom made by a jet breaking the sound barrier. But new data from NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) shows that our system and its heliosphere move through space too slowly to form a bow shock, and therefore does not exist. Instead there is a more gentle ‘wave.'
“While bow shocks certainly exist ahead of many other stars, we're finding that our Sun's interaction doesn't reach the critical threshold to form a shock,” said Dr. David McComas, principal investigator of the IBEX mission, “so a wave is a more accurate depiction of what's happening ahead of our heliosphere — much like the wave made by the bow of a boat as it glides through the water.”
From IBEX data, McComas and his team were able to make refinements in relative speed of our system, as well as finding more information about the local interstellar magnetic field strength. IBEX data have shown that the heliosphere actually moves through the local interstellar cloud at about 52,000 miles per hour, roughly 7,000 miles per hour slower than previously thought. That is slow enough to create more of a bow “wave” than a shock.
Another influence is the magnetic pressure in the interstellar medium. IBEX data, as well as earlier Voyager observations, show that the magnetic field is stronger in the interstellar medium requiring even faster speeds to produce a bow shock. Combined, both factors now point to the conclusion that a bow shock is highly unlikely.
This new finding perhaps correlates with earlier investigations by the CLUSTER mission, which found the bow shock was remarkably thin.
The IBEX team combined its data with analytical calculations and modeling and simulations to determine the conditions necessary for creating a bow shock. Two independent global models — one from a group in Huntsville, Ala., and another from Moscow — correlated with the analytical findings.
Their paper was published today in the journal Science.
How does this new finding change our understanding of our heliosphere?
“It's too early to say exactly what this new data means for our heliosphere,” McComas said. “Decades of research have explored scenarios that included a bow shock. That research now has to be redone using the latest data. Already, we know there are likely implications for how galactic cosmic rays propagate around and enter the solar system, which is relevant for human space travel.”

Building work on what will be the world's second largest hydropower station started Thursday.
The Baihetan project is located downstream of the Jinsha River, the upper section of the Yangtze, in Ningnan county of southwest China's Sichuan Province and Qiaojia county of neighboring Yunnan Province, according to the China Three Gorges Corporation.
With a total installed capacity of 16 million kilowatts, the project is expected to generate more than 60 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year, which is equal to two-thirds of Beijing's electricity consumption in 2015.
According to the construction plan, the first group of units of the project are expected to start operation in 2021 and all units by the end of 2022.
With a 300-meter-high dam, the project can manage a basin area of 430,000 square kilometers, 91 percent of the Jinsha River's basin area.
Nearly 100,000 residents in Sichuan and Yunnan will be relocated to make way for the project.
Channel 4's live coverage of Formula 1, beginning with the Bahrain Grand Prix next weekend, will feature no additional live feeds, this site can confirm.
The feeds were previously featured on the BBC's website and Red Button service from 2009 to 2015. The live video feeds included on-board cameras, a pit lane feed and a driver tracker. Instead, Sky have gained exclusivity to these feeds as part of their contract with Formula One Management (FOM).
Furthermore, Channel 4 note that they will not be continuing with BBC's F1 Forum programme as they do not have a Red Button service. The forum used to air via BBC's website and the Red Button. Again, there was the hope that the forum (or a programme of a similar nature) would air either via online, or one of Channel 4's supplementary channels such as More4. Channel 4 are keen to emphasise though that they are looking for ways to “expand our service.”
A Channel 4 spokeswoman told this site: “We don't have any access to extra feeds for live content, Sky has that exclusively as part of their deal. Although we don't have a red button service for us to do a ‘fan forum' type programme, we are looking at ways we can expand our service.”
“We have already launched channel4.com/f1 which is the home for the voice of our presenting talent – with authored columns from DC and Karun. We'll also have lots of video from all the races available online e.g. here is a highlights package we produced from Australia – http://f1.channel4.com/video/australian-grand-prix-highlights/. And we're looking to expand what we do as we move through the season. “

• Republicans insist on spending cuts without raising taxes • Obama sets 22 July deadline for action • JP Morgan chief warns of severe damage to global economy if US defaults
The US faces the prospect of a "catastrophe" as President Barack Obama stands firm against Republican demands for deep spending cuts without any tax increases as the condition for raising the country's borrowing limit and avoiding a debt default.
With Washington gripped by a growing sense that it may be too late to avert a crisis, the president has said he will give the increasingly rancorous negotiations until the end of next week to reach agreement on the terms for raising the US's $14.3 trillion (£8.9tn) debt ceiling.
The White House has said that if there is no agreement by 22 July, then discussion about budget cuts and taxes should be abandoned in favour of legislation dealing solely with raising the debt ceiling before the borrowing limit is reached on 2 August. But the Republicans have rejected legislation without agreement on budget cuts.
With European leaders also facing a potentially ruinous debt crisis, a leading Wall Street figure described the prospect of a US default as catastrophic.
Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JP Morgan, one of Wall Street's biggest banks, said: "No one can tell me with certainty that a US default wouldn't cause catastrophe and wouldn't severely damage the US or global economy. And it would be irresponsible to take that chance."
On Wednesday, Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned of a "huge financial calamity" if a political agreement is not reached. He told Congress a default would "send shockwaves through the entire financial system".
Hours later, the credit ratings agency Moody's warned that it may downgrade the US's AAA credit rating, saying there is a "rising possibility" that no deal will be reached by next month's deadline.
On Thursday, Moody's threatened to downgrade the AAA ratings of government lenders Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Federal Home Loan Banks and Federal Farm Credit Banks, illustrating the vulnerability of the already depressed housing market to a government default.
Talks continued on Thursday but failed to make progress. Obama told congressional leaders that unless a framework deal is agreed on Friday then negotiations will continue through the weekend.
China, the US's biggest creditor, added to the pressure on Thursday by publicly urging Washington to protect investors' interests. The dollar continued its fall as investors shifted to other assets such as gold, which hit a record high on Thursday.
At the heart of the political wrangling is a determination by each side to blame the other for a stagnant economy, with unemployment remaining stubbornly high at above 9%. The latest economic figures showed only a 0.1% increase in retail sales and a minor drop in the number of new jobless claims – by 22,000 to 405,000 last week – suggesting the rate at which companies are laying off workers is falling.
If the debt ceiling is not raised by 2 August, Obama will be forced to decide which parts of the government to shut down and which to keep going using continuing tax revenues, as well as how much of those revenues to direct to meeting payments to foreign holders of US bonds.
The president would have to decide whether to cut off unemployment benefits for those out of work and pension payments to the elderly. He might freeze the military payroll, a large expense but a move bound to bring stinging attacks from the Republicans. Many, if not all, government offices would close.
"You would have to make heinous choices about which bills you would pay," said the White House press secretary, Jay Carney.
The Republicans propose $2.4tn in immediate spending cuts with no tax increases. Obama says the scale of those cuts demanded by Republicans can be reached, but only in several stages, and that tax increases are essential to reduce the deficit.
But the Republicans won control of the House of Representatives in November's election on a platform of promising no new taxes. Newly elected members fear compromise will cost them voter support.
Concern that agreement will not be reached has been reinforced by Republican claims that Obama stormed out of a meeting on Wednesday evening.
Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, said the president "got very agitated, seemingly" and quoted him as saying: "Eric, don't call my bluff. I'm going to the American people with this." Democrats disputed the account.
Prospects for a deal are further undermined by divisions within the Republican party. House Republican leaders believe much of the country will blame Obama for any economic consequences of a default on the debt. But the party's Senate leadership is more sceptical.
The Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, fears his party will share the blame if the US defaults on its debt and the economy suffers. "I refuse to help Barack Obama get re-elected by marching Republicans into a position where we have co-ownership of a bad economy," he told a radio show.
McConnell noted that a shutdown of the government in 1995 helped re-elect Bill Clinton as president the following year after voters blamed Republican leaders in Congress. He has attempted to buy the Republicans a way out by proposing Congress hand over power to raise the debt ceiling to Obama without first approving spending cuts. That would shift responsibility for increased spending to the president and allow the Republicans to say they worked to keep to their commitment.
But McConnell's proposal was rejected by his own leadership in the House of Representatives, which fears anything short of substantial spending cuts will be viewed as betrayal by Republican voters.
When the beings of the world perform intolerable and many harmful activities, God throws the dice. He steps in his shoes and comes down to earth to teach these unruly beings a lesson. This is when he undergoes incarnation. In order to maintain balance in the law of nature, God manifests himself into several avatars and incarnations.
Lord Shiva who is considered to be the God of Gods and unique among all has taken innumerable incarnations to help the mankind. His stories of conquering the disastrous and the antisocials are very interesting. All the Hindus are aware of his many avatars and people also celebrate these days pompously, even today. But, there are avatars which many must not have heard of.
NAMDEVA
Lord Brahma's time cycle is different from others. It is believed that normal 4.32 billion years constitute one day of Brahma. 4.32 billion years*365 forms one year for Brahma which is known as one Kalpa. On the 20th Kalpa named ‘Rakta' the color of Brahma's skin had turned red. During his meditation, he discovered someone with a similar skin color present there. He then realized that it was an incarnation of Lord Shiva and named him Namdeva.
SADHOJAT
This incarnation of Lord Shiva was based on Brahma. It is believed that during severe penance of Brahma, Shiva took the form of Sadhojat. This is believed to be his first incarnation. As time progressed, from the body of Sadhojat, 4 of his disciples manifested. They were named Sunand, Nandan, Vishwanandan and Upanandan. This avatar represents Iccha Sakti. It is more about the appearance of the Lord and related to his fearsome aspect.
GHORESH
During the Shiva Kalpa of Lord Brahma, Shiva took an incarnation. A black smoky form aroused during the meditation of Brahma. Lord Brahma named him ‘Aghor'. This avatar represented infinite knowledge. This form depicted the intense features of nature. There are Sages today who are named as ‘Aghori baba' and they live an extremely weird life.
ISHAN
During the Vishwaroop Kalpa, manifestations of Saraswati and Lord Shiva occurred. This avatar represents space. The individual is from very less to not at all receptive to social structures. Possesses excellent qualities of controlling mortal and divine beings with ease. The individual has reduced his ego to ashes signifying absolute love for the universe and has been freed from cosmic law.
TAT PURUSHA
During the 21st Kalpa- Peetavasa, God Brahma adorned himself with only yellow apparels. God Brahma's meditation and prayers resulted in the manifestation of a beaming entity. It was an incarnation of Lord Shiva named as Tat Purusha. It represents the structure of the soul. The individual merges with infinite and is yellow in color. If you have severe difficulty in focusing on any subject, you should meditate this face of Shiva.
SHARABH AVATAR
It is the 6th avatar of lord Shiva. He was part-lion and part-bird beast. He had eight legs and possessed the ability to clear a valley in one jump. Lord Shiva had taken this avatar to calm the Narashima avatar of Vishnu. History shows the Narasimha beneath Sharabha's legs as a human. This form is extolled to usher good luck, cure all diseases and destroy all enemies.
PIPLAAD AVATAR
Piplaad was born to a sage Dhatichi. His father left him even before he was born. When he grew up he questioned the Devas about his bad luck. They said it was because of the planetary positions. On discovering this he cursed Shani Deb and hence he started falling down its celestial abode. Piplaad decided to forgive Shani on the condition that it will not trouble anyone before 16 years of age. Hence, people who suffer from Shani Dosh are said to worship this avatar of lord Shiva.

The Big 12 has a problem.
And like any massive and complicated problem, it can only be conquered one step at a time.
To retake its place as one of the preeminent conferences in college football, the league can take these steps to rehabilitate its tarnished image:
Step 1: Win the nonconference games that count
Due to its collective scheduling practices, the Big 12 doesn't have many prime opportunities for marquee nonconference victories this season. That means the league must win the few noteworthy games it does have on the docket -- Texas at Notre Dame, Oklahoma at Tennessee and Texas Tech at Arkansas.
Big 12 nonconference opponents The Big 12 has precious few spots to impress the playoff committee with nonconference games against Power 5 opponents. Only seven Big 12 teams play such games in 2015. TEAM POWER 5 OPP. Iowa State Iowa Kansas at Rutgers Oklahoma at Tennessee TCU at Minnesota Texas at Notre Dame; Cal Texas Tech at Arkansas WVU Maryland
After that, however, the Big 12 likely won't have another opportunity for a top-25 nonconference win. And when the College Football Playoff selection committee begins to deliberate, best believe it will be comparing how each Power 5 conference performed in those types of games.
A year ago, West Virginia, Oklahoma State, Texas and Kansas State all hung tough with Alabama, Florida State, UCLA and Auburn, respectively. But, moral victories won't be enough.
Without a top-25 win, the Big 12 won't compare favorably in the eyes of the committee, even if TCU beats Minnesota, West Virginia takes care of Maryland and Iowa State topples Iowa again.
Whether it happens in South Bend, Knoxville or Fayetteville, the Big 12 must have a win it can point to this time around that will enhance the credibility of the overall league.
Step 2: Schedule tougher
In short term, all the Big 12 can do is win the games on the schedule. But in the long term, the league must schedule better as a whole, to give it more than, say, three opportunities for a marquee victory.

This season, Baylor, Kansas State and Oklahoma State have nonconference slates that don't include a single Power 5 opponent. Texas and Oklahoma, meanwhile, are the only Big 12 schools without an FCS opponent.
Such lackluster schedules will damage the overall strength of schedule of the Big 12, and thus, the teams that do wind up vying for a playoff spot, regardless of how they scheduled individually.
Yes, the Big 12 is not getting enough credit from the playoff committee for playing nine conference games. Yes, the SEC is not getting enough demerits for hosting FCS cupcakes in November. And yes, Ohio State proved you can still get into the playoff without you or your conference netting a significant nonconference win.
Yet neither the SEC nor Ohio State is fighting a battle against perception. The Big 12 is.
Many of the league's members are undergoing measures to augment their nonconference schedules. Baylor, which draws criticism for weak nonconference scheduling, is working to play its 2016 opener against a Power 5 opponent in Australia.
But whether it's through scheduling mandate or by unwritten agreement, the Big 12 must enhance its schedules to give itself more chances to prove its worthiness to the committee.

Step 3: Showcase the league's budding rivalry
Two rounds of conference realignment gutted several of college football's most compelling rivalries, nowhere more than among Big 12 members. Texas-Texas A&M, Oklahoma-Nebraska, Kansas-Missouri and West Virginia-Pitt are all now mostly defunct.
But among its few silver linings, realignment revived the Baylor-TCU game. Since reconnecting as conference foes, the "Revivalry" has carried the stakes, drama and acrimony to emerge as one of the most anticipated showdowns in college football.
This season, the Big 12 smartly elected to showcase the Baylor-TCU game on Black Friday to give it even more national exposure.
The Big 12, however, didn't do TCU or Baylor any favors.
Six days before traveling to Fort Worth, Baylor has to go to Oklahoma State; six days before playing host to the Bears, TCU has to go to Oklahoma. It won't be easy for either Baylor or TCU to thrive facing such a gauntlet on short rest.
The Big 12 has the right idea in promoting this game, its third-biggest rivalry behind the Red River and Bedlam games. Yet Texas, as usual, has the weekend off before playing its annual Thanksgiving Day game. Going forward, the league should give Baylor and TCU the same consideration it also gives the Longhorns.
Step 4: Schedule smarter
The league has a great Thanksgiving weekend lineup: Texas Tech-Texas on Thanksgiving, Baylor-TCU on Black Friday and Bedlam Saturday. It's the final weekend that's a problem.
Parity and postseason hurting Big 12 Parity can be great for a league, but parity that breeds middling results isn't helping the Big 12. Add to the fact that Big 12 champions keep losing in major bowl games and it adds to the growing perception problem that the league is facing.
Brandon Chatmon • Big 12 blog
Without a championship game, the Big 12 office has been rotating teams in and out of the final weekend, with the goal of giving different schools the opportunity to use that week to focus on recruiting instead of playing.
That strategy, however, could backfire in a big way this season.
In 2015, three of the top four teams in the conference preseason poll -- TCU, Oklahoma and Oklahoma State -- will be off on championship weekend. Given how dramatically the committee altered its rankings on championship weekend last year, the Big 12's scheduling practices could deprive the Horned Frogs, Sooners or Cowboys of the chance to send the committee a message on the field when it might matter the most.
"If you're one of the teams that has a chance to be in the playoff, you'd want to have a presence that weekend, I would think," said Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops, who wants Bedlam to be moved to Dec. 5.
Since the Big 12's deadline to move games in concert with its TV partners passed on June 1, this can't change this season.
But in the future, the Big 12's playoff viability should trump all. Make the change and have the premier teams in front of the committee the day before the selections.
Step 5: Get Texas and OU back on track
These are things that only the Longhorns and Sooners can solve.
The Longhorns becoming relevant again would only serve to make the Big 12 more relevant nationally, too.

Charlie Strong appears to have Texas on the right track. But the sooner he gets Texas relevant again -- recruiting better and an upset victory at Notre Dame would be nice -- the better it will be for the Big 12.
Oklahoma hasn't been carrying its weight lately, either. Middling results and getting blown out in a bowl game just won't cut it for a conference blueblood.
It's simple: when a conference's flagships are performing (see Ohio State and the Big Ten) it changes the way people perceive that conference.
Imagine a Big 12 in which Oklahoma and Texas returned to their 2008 levels to complement the rises of TCU and Baylor (yes, there are enough recruits in the state of Texas to go around for this scenario). We wouldn't be talking about a league fighting to survive.
We'd be talking about the best conference in college football.
Step 6: Implement a championship game
Enough beating around the bush; the Big 12 is operating at a disadvantage staging only 12 regular season games without a championship. Committee chairman Jeff Long copped to this in the spring. The only question now is, how much of a disadvantage is the Big 12 at compared to the other four major conferences, who give their champs a shot at a 13th game?
The league is in no shape to be starting from behind the pack before the season even begins.
Sure, a championship game is an awkward fit in a 10-team round-robin format, but if the committee is going to punish the Big 12 for not having a 13th game and a championship, the Big 12 has little choice but to implement one.
And that's just another reason why expansion is ultimately the long-term answer.

Step 7: Target the best expansion candidates
Oklahoma president David Boren correctly assessed that in the wake of losing Nebraska to the Big Ten and Texas A&M and Missouri to the SEC, the Big 12 had become "psychologically disadvantaged."
The conference is not yet in danger of dissolving, but it will be when the grant-of-right TV contracts that have bound the Big 12 together expire in 2025. The most vulnerable get devoured. So to avoid such a fate, the Big 12 must become proactive.
In the long term, expansion would strengthen the foundation of the conference. And in the short term, it would make the league more competitive for the playoff, giving the league a 13th game and championship. It could also serve to improve the league's national perception while enhancing its strength of schedule profile.
Of course, adding any two teams for the sake of expanding won't cure the Big 12's ills.
"You don't want to just add two teams and split with whatever money you have 12 ways instead of 10 ways if they're not bringing value to it," Stoops said. "But if they're bringing value, then sure, it needs to be 12."
Houston has a new stadium and a hotshot coach in Tom Herman, who is already turning heads on the recruiting trail. Cincinnati is completing a renovation of its stadium, and has won at least nine games in all but one season since 2006. Memphis is planning facility upgrades off its 10-win season as well under Justin Fuente. All three schools are in big markets, too.
Central Florida has a massive student body and would give the Big 12 an avenue to greater recruiting exploits in the prospect hotbed of Florida. Colorado State is building a $220 million stadium. And East Carolina averaged almost 45,000 in attendance last year, which would've ranked seventh in the Big 12.
All these programs have upside worth monitoring.
But if the Big 12 expanded tomorrow, the two schools that would bring the most value to the league would be BYU and Boise State.
The Cougars have won a national title in the last 30 years. And in the last 40, only Nebraska, Ohio State, Oklahoma and Florida State have more victories.
Since 1999, Boise State has won at least 10 games in all but three seasons.

Both would bring a quality brand of football that would help quell the perception gap the Big 12 is fighting.
On top of that, they would bring more to the TV pie than they would take out. Because of the Mormon Church, BYU has an international following. Boise State has been a TV darling since it stunned Oklahoma in the 2006 Fiesta Bowl.
Whatever direction the Big 12 goes, it has to get serious about expanding. To strengthen the Big 12 for the present. And help sustain it for the future.
Step 8: Win a national championship
It's easier said than done, but nothing could elevate the Big 12 more than one of its members finally winning a national title again. The Big 12 hasn't won a national championship in 10 years. It hasn't even played in one in six.
Just look at what Ohio State did for the Big Ten. Not that long ago, the Big Ten was termed slow and outdated, and was a national punchline for its inability to hang with the SEC. Nobody is referring to the Big Ten as second tier anymore.
TCU or Baylor or Oklahoma winning a national title would achieve the same for the Big 12. Ultimately, the Big 12 will have to earn back its reputation. And that can only happen from getting on the biggest stage and beating the best on the field.
Ban on entrance of much-needed cement to Gaza enters seventh week
May 18, 2016. Late last week (May 11-12), Egypt opened Rafah Crossing, connecting Egypt and Gaza to limited pedestrian travel: 739 people exited Gaza and 1,220 entered the Strip. During this time, Egypt also allowed thousands of tons of cement to enter the Strip, as it has on several occasions over the past year (39,000 tons since the end of Protective Edge). This time the entrance of the cement was particularly significant given that Israel has not allowed any cement to enter Gaza for the private sector for more than six weeks (since April 3rd). Israel's ban on entrance of cement to the private sector was instituted, according to news reports, following the revelation that cement had been diverted in a breach of the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism (GRM). Prior to the ban, Israel had reduced the entry of cement into Gaza for some months.
Cement destined for the private sector in Gaza, when allowed in, goes through the GRM, which was established following the 2014 hostilities at Israel's request in cooperation with the Palestinian Authority and United Nations monitoring. The cumbersome mechanism is meant to enable Israel to monitor how construction materials are used. In the first three months of 2016, before the ban, 87% of the cement entering Gaza was designated for the private sector. The military admitted (Hebrew) last year already that the GRM had not managed to prevent materials from reaching the black market. The entry of cement via Egypt last week is not unprecedented either.
Gaza's need for construction materials in general, and cement in particular, is immense. According to a recent UN report, nearly 90,000 of the people who lost their homes during Operation Protective Edge, are still considered displaced.
The prohibition on bringing in cement has practically halted almost all private building in the Gaza Strip. Osama Kahil, chairman of the Contractors' Association in Gaza cited that of 320 construction contracting companies, just 70 are working at partial capacity on projects implemented by international organizations. Farid Zaqout, chairman of the Building Industry Association in Gaza, says that of 35 concrete factories in the Gaza Strip, only five remain operational and only at partial capacity. Of 180 factories that manufacture cinder blocks and are authorized to operate under the GRM, only 10 are currently operational, and of the five Gaza factories that produce concrete cylinders, only one is active. These factories provide livelihoods for about 4,000 people, most of whom are currently unemployed. Without the raw materials produced by these factories, tens of thousands of workers in related sectors, such as sewage infrastructure restoration, are unable to work as well.
The thousands of families who depend on cement for their livelihoods now await the results of apparent, ongoing discussions that we hope will inevitably lead to the cancellation of the ban. The question is, how long will it take and in the meantime, what price will be paid by residents of Gaza and of Israel? Given the needs and rights of Gaza residents and the fact that the GRM in any case is failing to meet its stated goals, Israel must renew the entry of cement immediately.

Motivation
For the uninitiated, Internet Governance (IG) as a bureacratic process was basically established by the United Nations to discuss all issues relevant to global policy implications of the internetworking. This process was kicked off by the World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) which was groundbreaking at the time for bringing together state, capital and civil society in much hyped multistakeholder discussions. Then it transformed into a series of other meetings and processes called Internet Governance Forum (IGF) which were more of a talk shop than anything else.
As Milton Mueller pictured very evocatively, this year the IGF started to leak, with participants deserting the process left and right. On the one hand, state and capital escaped in the direction of the World Economic Forum (WEF) with NetMundial Initiative (NMI), while grassroots activists and civil society boycotted by setting up the Internet Ungovernance Forum in Istanbul as a counterprocess. An ironic historical twist is that years ago the alterglobalisation movement have set up the World Social Forum process exactly against the WEF, and now activists have to battle the IGF with the UFG… so much for multistakeholder dialogue!
This post is a birds-eye view evaluation of my experience with Internet Governance which I believe echoes the feelings of many media activists of my generation. I will tell how IG began for me and why I left it behind. Rather than being lost in the details, I am trying to follow the historical arc of IG and its changing political potentials over time.
Attending the 2014 4S (Society for Social Studies of Science) meeting in Buenos Aires, I went to a panel on Politics, Publics, Participation and Practices: Governance of Technologies in Global Networks featuring leading IG scholar Milton Mueller's Syracuse University students. Here I expand on an intervention I made there, further encouraged by subsequent conversations with Sandra Braman. The reason why I actually sat down to write this is to support and contribute to the Internet Ungovernance Forum in Instanbul which starts in a few days, featuring a strategy workshop for Internet activists.
Expectations
When I first heard about World Summit on Information Society it struck me as a grave and important historical moment. The first United Nations conference which includes Civil Society. The first high-profile international event dedicated to the Internet. Will it be a chance to change fix how the Internet is run, or even how it works? Or does it usher in a new, darker era of some global organisation which Controls All the Networks? Between the two, is there a window of opportunity to counter the historical hegemony of the United States over all issues digital?
Even though convened by the ancient International Telecommunications Union (ITU) which designed the suite of Internet protocols that lost in the face of modern ones made by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), it had all the dangers and aspirations of the classic United Nations idea – dressed in shiny fresh cyberclothes. The sweet moment was soured soon as I ran into a wall of acronyms which looked unpenetrable until Bureau d'Études arranged them in a pattern which finally made sense. I had the fortune to be embedded in the flagship civil society actor, the Association for Progressive Communications (APC). They wisely chose the strategy of capacity building for activists but also for weaker states whose politicians often had no clue about what is the Internet. The idea was that we can thus find a leverage.
Results
The subsequent developments are chronicled in a series of hollow official statements and dissappointed position papers and desparate blog posts. In a nutshell, nothing really changed. IG was not just a failure of civil society as usual! Most states and capital actors were likewise frustrated in their attempts to move such a large conglomerate of issues in their direction.
On the academic terrain, a whole industry of IG literature was established, with hundreds of books, thousands of papers and even more courses and presentations given on the topic. Scholars and activists gradually got lost in the details because there was so much process going on, and the big picture was not going to change much. The final analysis was that despite appearances the fundamental rules of the Internet are here to stay, even if it is supposed to be the fastest evolving and at the same time the largest technological artefact ever created. This realisation was one of the reasons for me not to focus on IG research.
Reasons
My point is that we came in too late. By the time activists and scholars grasped IG mechanisms in their significance as a system, it has solidified. In Science and Technology Studies we call this process stabilisation, and the mechanisms which drive it closure. Every technology tends towards stabilisation and the various social groups involved in the process use closure mechanisms to fix this or that part of the system until there is a solid consensus about what is a valid, working specimen of the said technology. The WSIS was simply convened after this happened, and none of the participants managed to roll back history or find an opening through which the terms can be re-discussed. The United States and its established international organisations stuck to their powers and mandates in the face of all the discussion. There was no political situation or technological condition which necessitated budging the status quo, and nobody came up with an effective anti-closure mechanism.
Earlier we could have intervened more successfully, with greater mobilisation and strategical visions when the major organisations which hold power over parts of the instrastructure were established. Now that train is gone. I think in such a situation the most constructive scholarship is historical: the right questions to ask is how existing structures were build and especially what keeps them in place. Other than that, we have to look elsewhere to account for the rapid historical changes that nevertheless characterise the Internet landscape. Despite the growing influence of states, these are to be found at the moment in the political economy of the industry, as it is mediated through further layers of technologies on the otherwise stable basis of TCP/IP networks. (About the latter, it is astonishing how we can talk about the dynamism of ICTs when it takes forever to roll out IPv6 – a technology that doesn't even require building new infrastructure.)
Conclusion
Internet Governance is a trap. There is a smokescreen of meetings, process and discussion which take a lot of energy without any hope that things will change. Engaging with such a process in the guise of civil society even legitimises it and provides the necessary semblance of participation. The scholarly community often assists to this by reproducing either the megalomaniac rhetoric of the politicians about the significance of the process, or the narratives of the NGOs about frustrated democratic hopes. While there are a lot of small turfs to fight, the policy space is rather hopeless, until there is a political situation which can open up the solidified structures. The overhead is prohibitely expensive, and good old disruptive technologies do more to change the rules of the game.

(Yonhap)
South Korea‘s exports recorded the fastest quarter growth among the world's leading exporting countries with its first quarter revenue totaling $132.3 billion, up 14.9 percent from the same period last year, according to data from the World Trade Organization on Sunday.Despite a decline in world trade over the past two years, Korea's exports have recovered rapidly, jumping from the No. 8 spot last year to No. 6 among the top 10 exporting countries ranking for the first quarter of this year.The Korea Customs Service stated exports from May 1 to 20 totaled to $25.4 billion, up 3.4 percent from the same period a year earlier.Exports also jumped 24.1 percent last month, rising every month since last November. Despite exports to the US declining by 6.5 percent, the export-heavy Korea has seen an increase in exports for the past seven consecutive months, with exports up 3.4 percent so far in the month of May.The volume of oil and petrochemical goods exports by Korean refiners also reached an all-time high in the first three months of the year. According to the data compiled by the Korea Petroleum Association late last month, exports by SK Innovation, Hyundai Oilbank, GS-Caltex, S-Oil and others companies reached 117 million barrels -- a 6.5 percent rise compared the same period last year.Data compiled by the Bank of Korea last month showed the country‘s first quarter gross domestic product had also grown faster than anticipated, expanding by 0.9 percent quarter-on-quarter from January to March after growing 0.5 percent in last year's fourth quarter.According to the WTO, the world trade industry as a whole is seeing its first signs of rebounding this year, raking in $76.67 trillion dollars in the first three months of the year, up roughly 10.4 percent compared to 2016.The world's 71 main trading countries saw an average first quarter rate growth this year reaching roughly 9.8 percent, with 64 countries seeing positive growth.China's exports -- the world‘s largest exporter – rose by 8.2 percent, while exports from the US, the world's second largest exporter, rose by 7.3 percent.Exports across Asia also showed signs of positive growth with Japan, rank No. 4 in trade volume, saw a 10.2 percent jump in its exports.Outside the Top 10 nation's rankings in Asia, Indonesia saw a 21.1 percent spike in exports, the Philippines at 18.3 percent, India with 17 percent, Singapore with 16.2 percent, Vietnam at 15.1 percent and Taiwan with a 15.1 percent increase.By Julie Jackson (juliejackson@heraldcorp.com)
Academics from the University of Sydney are protesting against the bestowal of an honorary doctorate on John Howard, saying the former Prime Minister is "considered a racist and a war criminal" and "not a fit recipient of the university's highest honour".
The university said it is conferring the honour "in acknowledgement of his achievements including world-leading gun law reform, leadership in East Timor and contribution to Australia's economic reform".

But about 112 academics from the university had by Wednesday afternoon signed a petition opposing Friday's planned ceremony with Chancellor Belinda Hutchinson.
"To confer a doctorate on him is an insult to Indigenous people, refugees, and anyone committed to multiculturalism, peace and social progress in this country and in the world," the petition says.
The political deadlock in Germany is over after the Social Democrats led by Martin Schulz agreed to open exploratory talks on forming a government with Angela Merkel.
The two parties have governed Germany in a coalition for the past four years and after a disastrous loss in September's election the SPD initially said it would go into opposition.
"The preliminary talks are about content (issues) and about what we can realise as social democrats for this country," said SDP party leader Martin Schulz. "There will be no continuing as before, no prolonging the actual big coalition. The Federal Republic of Germany is in many ways that are important for the citizens not a modern country.
For Merkel, winning over the SPD is her only realistic chance of securing a fourth term in office without a new election.
SPD leaders hope to sell the about-face by forcing Merkel's conservatives to concede a raft of popular worker-friendly measures in exchange for their support,
The benefits of awards—even if you don't win
Awards have played an important role in Haley Gomez's career. When the professor of astrophysics and head of public engagement for the School of Physics and Astronomy at Cardiff University in the United Kingdom interviewed for a €1.8 million European Research Council grant in 2014, “the first thing I was asked about” was a Welsh public engagement award that she had received earlier that year. (She got the grant.) And winning the Royal Astronomical Society's Fowler Prize in 2015 for her scientific contributions has “made a huge difference” when applying for promotions and research grants, too, she adds. “It's almost a badge that says you are externally recognised as having achieved something by your community. It's also something to distinguish yourself against others in grant applications.”
But recognition aside, merely applying for awards or seeking to be nominated also brings a multitude of career benefits. Putting together an award application can help you reflect on your skills and career progress. It may push you to become more competitive by filling gaps in your CV and increasing your visibility. Seeking out senior colleagues who will cheer for you can help you build a strong support base for the future. Competing for awards also creates an opportunity to receive useful feedback about your work and how you are perceived from those who nominated you or awards committees, Gomez notes.
Of course, should you emerge from the process with an award in hand, all the better. But even if you don't win, competing for an award is often a worthwhile effort that will help you further your professional development.
It's all in the application
One of the greatest benefits of preparing an award application is that it encourages early-career researchers to engage in personal and professional self-assessment, says Sharon Maguire, a careers consultant at the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom. This involves “thinking about how you're developing as an individual, and how you're developing skills and experiences that can be applied in lots of different ways. That sort of self-reflection and self-awareness throughout the Ph.D. experience and beyond is really important” for developing a successful career, she says.
Studying the award criteria and looking at past winners may help you get a sense of what you want to strive for and identify skill gaps. Trying to fill these gaps will not only increase your chances of getting the award, but also put you in a stronger position for your future career planning and progression, Maguire says. Online tools such as the Vitae Researcher Development Framework or skills audits developed by your university can also give you some pointers for what may be expected of you, she adds.
Sometimes it's more a matter of adequately highlighting concrete evidence of skills and achievements you have already secured. Maguire recommends getting advice about how to do this from faculty members who have experience applying for similar awards or your university careers service. For example, they may suggest that you adapt the language in your application or emphasize certain aspects of your background or work. Going through this process will also stand you in good stead for applying for research grants in the future, Maguire says.
Get out there
Submitting an application for an award requires a certain degree of boldness, and those who are naturally shy or lack self-confidence shouldn't let that get in the way of promoting themselves. “You have to take the bull by the horns,” Maguire says. To make it a bit easier, she suggests building up confidence by asking for constructive and honest feedback from early-career researchers and your adviser or mentors about whether your work is worthy of an award and how well your application comes across. Other specialists within your university may also be able to offer such help with award applications, Maguire adds.
To give yourself a chance at the awards that require nomination by others, you need to be visible both within your department and in the wider scientific community, says Jigar Jogia, an associate professor of psychology at the American University in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates who won a Samuel Gershon Junior Investigator Award from the International Society for Bipolar Disorders in 2011. “Go and give a seminar, do a lecture at a different university, and go to a conference and present findings. That's the only way that people know about you,” Jogia recommends. Doing so will also “add to your portfolio of skills even if you don't win,” and it will aid networking and collaboration opportunities, he says.
If you're eyeing an award that relies on nomination and you are working in a place that is not supportive or does not have a culture of putting its members forward, one solution is to find allies outside the department, suggests Alfreda James, assistant director of the Career Center at Stony Brook University in New York. Mentoring schemes offered by your university could help you identify suitable mentors, Maguire adds.
Of course, one usually competes with the hope of winning. But in today's hypercompetitive environment, that can be rare, so it is worth being open-minded and creative when deciding which awards to pursue, as Gomez's experience with her public engagement award illustrates. It is also important to develop a thick skin in the face of setbacks and try again. “Don't take rejection too personally,” Jogia says. “Maybe there was a flaw in your application and you could improve that, or maybe you were pitted against amazing researchers and it was just the wrong time to apply.”
Applying for awards is time-consuming, however, and must not detract focus from research, teaching, or other duties. So, Jogia recommends, “don't just apply for everything. Apply strategically. … Really think, ‘Is this the right time for me? Have I done enough in my career, and have I got something to actually shout about, or am I just shouting?'”
As Coin Fire has previously reported, Ryan Kennedy committed fraud in the Dogecoin community last year. Kennedy, or “Alex Green” as he is known to the larger community, operated the cryptocurrency company Moolah before resigning amidst allegations of theft.
In October of last year, Kennedy allegedly stole upwards of 3,500 BTC from the Mintpal exchange. Shortly thereafter, Moolah announced it would begin filing for bankruptcy protection. Coin Fire shared a week later that both the CEO of Moolah and the company itself were under an SEC investigation for sales of unregistered securities over the Internet.
On October 16th, Kennedy posted publicly on the Moolah blog as Alex Green that he would be resigning from the company. At the time, he stated publicly,
I would like to start by saying that in context of the below, my identity is irrelevant. My identity becomes relevant if I break the law, which is something that neither myself nor my employees have done. To be as clear as I can, I could have been born as John Smith, and it wouldn't matter. This is not to be taken as confirmation or admission of anything, that will follow at a later stage. In the eyes of the law, my name is Alex Green.
It was later found that Mr. Kennedy had allegedly plundered the cryptocurrencies stored on the Mintpal exchange for his personal use. He then disappeared, even as lawsuits and injunctions began mounting against him.
Mr. Kennedy failed to repay the 750 bitcoins as ordered by His Honor Judge Seymour in a UK court in actions filed for SYScoin.
SYScoin, which suffered massive losses due to the theft of cryptocurrencies from MintPal, provided an update this afternoon about the state of the company. This update also contains relevant information about the entire Mintpal situation. A representative from the company stated,
Undoubtedly people are wondering what is going on with the legal battle regarding the 750btc stolen from the Syscoin Escrow fund, Mintpal / Moolah / Ryan Kennedy / Alex Green / etc. We are permitted to disclose that both Ryan Kennedy and Chelsea Hopkins were arrested by UK authorities. We're working with UK authorities, UK courts, Interpol and the legal bodies to resolve this properly and make sure any wrong doing is met with the full force of UK Justice. We're also ensuring any accomplices who were complicit in this crime are being held accountable. There are no free rides. We're speaking with our legal team regarding what more specifically we can release as there is much to say but until we've reviewed with our team, I can only say that the litigation continues. We've produced evidence verified by a cryptographic expert; the story the blockchain tells is not one that aligns with the explanation provided (bug stole the bitcoin) for the loss of the coins by Moolah.
Coin Fire has verified the arrest claims made by SYScoin and is able to report that Mr. Kennedy and his partner Ms. Hopkins have been arrested. Mr. Kennedy was held for failure to comply with the injunction placed against him, and both are currently being investigated regarding the alleged theft from Mintpal.
How this arrest will impact the SEC investigations regarding the activity of Mr. Kennedy, his “PIE” investments, and illegal solicitation of investment funds via an unregistered security remains to be seen.
Coin Fire will continue to follow this story.
Kickstarting Lotus Dimension, a pacifist RPG
Lotus Dimension is a tabletop, D&D-style role-playing game in which characters advance through nonviolent means -- a game that incorporates "amazing sci-fi and fantasy storytelling while also incorporating principles of nonviolence inspired by peaceful protests, historical leaders and the tenets of peaceful philosophical practices."
The creator, Scott Wayne Indiana, has already created and playtested a basic rulebook and has fully funded his $15,000 kickstarter to develop more advanced rules. $25 gets you a full ruleset.
One player acts as a guru guide, leading the other players through each quest. (The first quest, included in the Starter Set, is called "Liberation in the Zeppelins.") Players brainstorm together to solve problems, evade or defeat monsters or villains, overcome obstacles, deploy magic, obtain treasure and other rewards, free prisoners and find the way forward -- all while causing the least harm possible. Which can be super tricky. How do you escape imprisonment or confront a threat without using swords or spells that cause harm? How do you defeat an opponent to overcome obstacles and win treasure if your strategy has to consider your opponent's desires, safety and well-being as well as those of yourself and your own team? Through the challenges of each quest, players build their characters' inner strength, mindfulness and wisdom to advance to new levels.

ISLAMABAD (Web Desk) – The banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has claimed the responsibility of Gilgit helicopter crash stating that the incident was result of an attack it carried out, Express TV reported on Friday noon. ARY news, a local news
ISLAMABAD (Web Desk) – The banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has claimed the responsibility of Gilgit helicopter crash stating that the incident was result of an attack it carried out, Express TV reported on Friday noon.
ARY news, a local news channel, also reported presence of suspicious personnel in the vicinity of the crash site.
Some segments of the Urdu media have also published a statement by Taliban commander Khurrasani in which he has promised to soon unveil the missile used in the attack. According to the statement, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's was the target. It is pertinent to mention here that PM Nawaz was also traveling to Gilgit in another helicopter.
However, this could not be independently verified by our correspondents.
Pakistan government and army spokespersons have ruled out any such possibility.
Talking to journalists, DG ISPR Major General Asim Bajwa said, “the helicopter crashed due to a technical fault”, adding that as per procedure an inquiry board has been constituted to investigate the cause of the crash.
Minister for Defence Khawaja Asif has also rejected any possibility of terror attack. In a statement issued following the accident, the minister said the crash was a result of faulty tail router.
Ambassador of Philippines Domingo D Lucenario Jr, Ambassador of Norway Leif Larsen and wives of the Malaysian and Indonesian ambassadors, along with two Pakistani pilots, lost their lives in the incident.

Taco Bell is now selling warm donut holes covered in Cap'n Crunch's Crunch Berries cereal and filled with “milk icing,” a spokesperson tells TIME. The test began Thursday in Bakersfield, Calif., and the pastries are available in packs of two for $1.00, four for $1.69 or 12 for $4.49.
At first glance, they will probably make you think of milk and cereal snack bars. There are more mouth-watering photos over at the food blog FoodBeast, which first reported the story.
The Associated Press reported this week that big food companies like Taco Bell are trying out more “hipster” menus, looking for ways to “feel out changing tastes and cozy up to new customers, particularly those in their 20s and 30s.”

Alexey Navalny, the head of the Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), has published the agreement between the Russian government and the company RT-Invest that created the controversial new “Platon” highway toll system. The authorities refused to share this document with FBK, saying it contains trade secrets, but an anonymous source later delivered the materials to the foundation in a specially marked box.
The agreement is more than 400 pages. According to Navalny, a cursory analysis shows that, by the terms of the contract, RT-Invest doesn't pay the state anything, while the state pays the company more than 10 billion rubles ($139 million). Half of RT-Invest is owned by Igor Rotenberg, the son of Arkady Rotenberg (a businessman said to be personally close to Vladimir Putin).
The first demonstrations against the new Platon toll system began on November 11. They've only grown since then. The system levies a highway toll on semi trucks weighing more than 12 metric tons. There are believed to be roughly 2 million such trucks in Russia. In November, the toll for every kilometer was set at 1.52 rubles (a bit more than 2 cents). In December, that charge rose to 3.73 rubles (almost 6 cents) per kilometer.
During his annual press conference earlier in December, Putin implied that he has no intention of canceling the Platon toll system.
A Jewish grandmother was slugged in the back of the head by a young thug in Brooklyn Monday — and cops suspect it may be another instance of the violent “knockout game.”
The attacker didn't say a word or try to rob the 72-year-old Mira Harpazi, police sources said.
She had left her home in Starrett City to visit a Jewish community center in Canarsie.
She went to a nearby pharmacy and was returning to the center at around noon when the thug attacked her on the corner of Pennsylvania and Flatlands avenues.
The NYPD's Hate Crime Task Force is looking into whether the attack was an occurrence of the knockout game — a disturbing trend in which thugs sucker-punch passers-by, with the goal of rendering them unconscious.
Harpazi was not knocked out. She was treated at Brookdale Hospital and released.
The attacker, believed to be in his late teens or early 20s, was still at large Monday night.
A neighbor at Harpazi's East New York apartment was shocked about the attack, but said the grandma is one tough cookie.
“Miriam is all the over place, she's very independent,” said Barbara Fulton, 56. “She's a tough woman.”
“She has a lot friends. I'm surprised. I don't know why anyone would want to punch her.”
Meanwhile, police made an arrest Monday in another suspected knockout in Crown Heights where a 12-year-old boy was slugged.
Cops nabbed a 13-year-old and charged him with assault and aggravated harassment as a juvenile for the Nov. 6 attack.
Since Oct. 11, at least eight suspected knockout attacks have been reported in Brooklyn — in the Crown Heights, Midwood and Borough Park sections.
Police are investigating the cases, in which the victims, often Orthodox Jews, were struck by one thug as others looked on.
Harpazi, who is not Orthodox, did not report seeing any other people in the area at the moment she was assaulted
But police are seeking any witnesses and video evidence that it was a knockout-game attack.
The game — sometimes called “polar bear hunting,” because most victims are white — has been fueled by social media, with thugs boasting of their attacks online and posting Internet videos of the sucker punches.
The north London derby, Jeremy Corbyn once quipped, is the only time he doesn't support the underdog. The Labour leader is an Arsenal supporter, and for much of its history the Islington club has held the whip hand over its neighbours and fierce rivals, Tottenham Hotspur.
Nonetheless, it is Arsenal who will be at the heart of Labour HQ's attempt to rebrand its leader as a left-wing populist. Corbyn's allies worry that, for all his reputation as a raving pinko around Westminster, he is seen as just another Labour politician outside it. His much-discussed “relaunch” will therefore feature both his extra-curricular interests and a restatement of the more eye-catching parts of his programme. This is intended to tap into the hunger for radical change his team believe drove the Brexit vote and the triumph of Donald Trump. They also hope it will turn around the alarming poll ratings of both Corbyn and his party. (The most recent YouGov survey puts Labour at 26 per cent, compared with the Conservatives at 39. Corbyn has a personal favourability rating of minus 30.)
The best of the new approach was shown by a tweet sent on the evening of 9 January, in which the Labour leader promised to “talk some sense” into Piers Morgan about the question of Arsenal's manager, Arsène Wenger, whom Corbyn admires but Morgan abhors. However, its limitations were exposed by his Good Morning Britain interview on ITV the next day. There to prepare the ground for a speech that afternoon calling for “managed migration” to be part of Britain's Brexit deal, the Labour leader said that, actually, he didn't think immigration was too high and that free movement was a price worth paying to secure the best possible standard of access to the single market. His speech was stillborn before he delivered it.
Earlier in the day Corbyn also demonstrated another Trumpian tic: the casual newsmaking aside that quickly becomes the talking point of the day. Asked about high pay on the Today programme, he said: “I would like there to be some kind of high earnings cap, quite honestly.”
Was it deliberate? Probably not, but at least it dragged the economic debate in a new direction. If there is to be a left-wing mirror of Trumpism, this must be its form: tough talk on immigration and plenty of banker-bashing.
Later on, though, Corbyn tried to wrestle the discussion back to free movement. Here is the party's new position, such as it is: Labour is neither committed to maintaining free movement within Europe, nor is it committed to scrapping it.
This fudge is the result of a tricky balancing act: Corbyn wants to retain the third of Labour voters who opted to leave the European Union and the two-thirds who believe that immigration to the United Kingdom has been “too high”. But he doesn't want to lose Europhiles to the Greens and the Liberal Democrats or shred his own pro-migration principles.
Far from emulating Trump, it feels more as though Labour is returning to its Ed Miliband-era rut. Trying to avoid upsetting one group of voters, it ends up displeasing most of them equally. Had King Solomon been a Labour Party strategist, the baby would have ended up bisected.
Since Corbyn's victory, the scale of active insurrection among Labour MPs has often been exaggerated, both by a hostile press and, at times, by his allies. Although a hard core were plotting against him, the doomed attempt to remove him last summer came when an outbreak of despair and anger at the referendum result infected the mainstream of the party.
Now, after Corbyn's second successive leadership election victory, insurrectionist grumbling has given way to sullen silence. Even his natural allies fear there is no second chance at a first impression, and that the Labour leader will never recover from the impression made during his early days in the job, when he had only a skeleton staff and their priority was seeing off internal threats.
In Westminster, where most politicians are obsessed with America and pay little attention to the daily grind of politics across the Channel, it is easy to forget that Labour's dire polling is not exceptional for a centre-left party. (That said, who knows how many more liberal voters the Greens and Liberal Democrats can pick off during a national election campaign.)
Across the continent, just two centre-left parties regularly outpoll Corbyn's Labour: the Portuguese Socialists and the Italian Democrats, the latter of which averages 30 per cent on a good day. And of the two politicians held up as examples by Corbyn's internal opponents – Matteo Renzi of Italy and Manuel Valls of France – one suffered a self-inflicted defeat in 2016 and the other looks likely to join him in 2017.
Labour's Corbynsceptics have not yet accepted that the party's problems do not start or end with the leader. They describe him as an insurmountable obstacle to victory in 2020, but the bigger problem for them is that he has also proved an insurmountable obstacle to their thinking about the party's long-term future.
Corbyn may not be the solution to the question of how the party either wins over voters in Kensington or wins them back in Kirkcaldy, but he isn't the only obstacle. His team is also given little credit for their undoubted skills in navigating the new media landscape – although his defeated internal opponents ought to do so, having been outmanoeuvred on Facebook and Twitter.
Corbyn's populist rebrand at least engages with the challenge of competing with the nativist right. Critics of Ed Miliband used to say that he wanted to win by default. Jeremy Corbyn's opponents should learn from the failure of that strategy.
The year was 1949 when the concept of Ghost In The Machine possessed Oxford University philosopher, Gilbert Ryle, enough for him to write an entire discourse on the mind-body dualism. In his book, Concept of the Mind, he highlighted “the perceived absurdity where mental activity carries on in parallel to physical action, but where their means of interaction are unknown or, at best, speculative.''
Later, author Arthur Koestler, director Rachel Talalay, and pop musician Sting, were gripped by the notion, in 1967, 1993 and 1981, respectively. While literature, movies, and music were sent to the corner to mull over the possibilities, football allowed itself to be excused from such existential debates. However, in late 2016, the peculiarities of Roberto Firmino's forays in a Liverpool shirt have raised footballing philosophers from their deep sleep, and onto the edges of their seats.
In the recent past, football has had a brain drain, where physical stature was yardstick enough for one to forage for a feasible career in the sport. The quicker and stronger, the better. For every Andres Iniesta there are hundreds of Gareth Bales; for every Andrea Pirlo, a hundred Renato Sancheses; for every Francesco Totti, hundreds of Romelu Lukakus. This is not to say that they aren't as effective in the end-justifies-the-means world of modern football, but midfield marauder, Firmino seems to be the perfect calibration of German efficiency and Brazilian dare, of precision, physique and panache, and ultimately, of the body and the mind.
Physical off the ball, no other attacking player has made more tackles in the opposition half than the Brazilian with the German football education. (The one player who has won more tackles, in this year's edition of the Premier League, is Chelsea's N'Golo Kante, a designated defensive midfielder.) Cerebral on the ball, his core strength and poise to slip past defenders adds seconds to his minutes.
Anfield has seen the brute force of German engineering over the past few months; in the driver's seat of Jürgen Klopp's Liverpool juggernaut, is a ghost, with 22 goals in 34 appearances. A clocksmith on the football pitch, Firmino's frictionless aura of axle-grease oils the cogs and cranks in the grand device of demolition, springing traps all around the fields of Anfield Road. Ghosting through the corridors of opposition defences with untraceable ease, he hangs about in the fringes of the immediate play like the phantom of the grand opera, tugging on invisible strings. A master of puppets, passing 33 times and creating 19 goal-scoring chances in the penalty-box – a feat unmatched this season.
Bayern Munich has Thomas Muller in the similar cut of shroud, but Liverpool's Firmino comes back for an encore: 34 attempted dribbles near the rival goalmouth, 21 of them being successful, with a jaw-dropping hit rate of 61.77%.
You know how those floor boards always creak in horror movies, as the camera tiptoes its way around a narrow hallway, followed by a faraway cry of impending doom?
The varnish of the hardwood floor sanded off by time, with the mansion riddled by claw marks of old glory and better days. There is, however, something still lingering in the air and churning inside the walls, something picking off a group of none-the-wiser tourists, one by one. Visiting teams coming to Anfield this season may have felt the same uneasy feeling - collective goose-fleshing, as Firmino channels the spirits of the past, and, with the deadpan sense of humour that spirits have, executes defenders one pass at a time.

Israeli troops raided two Palestinian television stations in the West Bank city of Ramallah overnight, seizing computers and broadcasting equipment, employees told AFP on Wednesday.
The Israeli military confirmed the raids, saying the stations targeted had been broadcasting illegally, a charge rejected by the Palestinian telecommunications minister.
The two stations affected were Watan Television, a local private station, and Quds Educational Television, affiliated with the Palestinian Al-Quds University.
“They came at 2:00 am (0000 GMT) and took around 30 computers and all the transmitters. The station is totally shut down,” Watan's editor-in-chief, Ali Daraghmeh, told AFP.
“One of our guards tried to stop the army, but they told him they had official orders to close the station.”
Haroun Abu Arra, director of Quds Educational TV, said troops raided his station shortly afterwards.
“At 3:00 am (0100 GMT), the Israeli army entered the television station's office and took all the transmitters, and the station is now unable to broadcast,” he said.
Moammer Orabi, Watan's director general, said there were no warnings before the raid took place.
“It was a surprise. We still don't know why they confiscated the equipment and shut down the station, even though we work in areas belonging to the Palestinian Authority and we have a licence from them,” he said.
An Israeli military spokeswoman said the raids came after “multiple requests” from the Israeli communications ministry to the two stations to halt operations.
“IDF (Israel Defence Forces) soldiers accompanied an operation of the ministry of communications to close two pirate television station in Ramallah,” she said.
“This station significantly interrupts other legal broadcasting stations and interferes with aircraft communications.”
No one at the communications ministry was immediately available for comment.
But Palestinian telecommunications minister Mashour Abu Daqqa angrily rejected the claims, saying Israel had failed to make any official complaint through the proper channels to the Palestinian Authority.
“They are liars,” Abu Daqqa told AFP. “If there is any problem, we have an Israel-Palestinian coordination committee and we discuss any problems regarding frequencies all the time.
“We didn't receive anything through this committee and we believe that the Israeli army wants to change realities on the ground, ignoring all the committees formed.”
Daqqa said the stations were both registered with the International Broadcasting Union and broadcast on legal frequencies.
They are both based in Ramallah, which lies within a part of the West Bank designated as under full Palestinian civil and security control. Israel carries out frequent raids in the area nonetheless.
The raids were condemned by Palestinian prime minister Salam Fayyad, who visited Watan's offices after the raid, describing it as “a new and very dangerous Israeli escalation against the Palestinian Authority.”
Journalists said they would hold a demonstration in Ramallah's central square later on Wednesday to protest against the raid.

Today is tax day: America's annual tradition of muddling through complex paperwork and impenetrable jargon to stay in the Internal Revenue Service's good graces.
Fortunately for us, companies like Intuit and H&R Block provide services and software like TurboTax to make the process more comprehensible. Obviously, they don't do this for free: Americans will pay the tax preparation industry around $12 billion this year for their help. But private companies must make a profit, after all.
So we taxpayers should be grateful, right?
Actually, Intuit and H&R Block and their fellows are a big reason why doing your taxes is so unpleasant.
Admittedly, one problem here is just that the tax code is really complicated, thanks to all the deductions and credits and carve-outs. The mess tends to build over time until, roughly every 30 years, Congress does a housecleaning. And we're due for another round of reform.
But regardless of how complicated the tax code itself gets, there's a lot we could do to make the process of filing our taxes quicker and simpler.
Right now, Americans prepare their tax returns themselves. But when most Americans fill out their wages and dividends and mortgage payments and all the rest on their tax forms, they're not telling the government anything it doesn't already know. So once Americans have filed their returns, the government checks their work against its own calculations, and decides whether it agrees. If the government doesn't agree, taxpayers then choose whether to fight it.
In other words, filling out your own tax return is often an entirely superfluous step. That's why plenty of other countries — Japan, Israel, the Netherlands, Britain, Peru, Sweden, Spain, etc. — don't include it in the process. The government just cuts to the chase: It prepares everyone's tax returns itself, sends them out, and then taxpayers check the returns for errors.
It's called a "return-free filing" system.
T.R. Reid recently described how this system works for his friend Michael, "a Dutch executive with a six-figure income, a range of investments, and all the economic complications that come with an upper-bracket lifestyle."
An American in the same situation would have to fill out a dozen forms, six pages long. Michael, by contrast, sets aside 15 minutes per year to file his federal and local income tax, and that's usually enough. But sometimes, he told me, he decides to check the figures the government has already filled in on his return. At this point, Michael was getting downright indignant. "I mean, some years, it takes me half an hour just to file my taxes!" [T.R. Reid, The New York Times]
Imagine that! Getting upset because the entirely free process took half an hour instead of 15 minutes. Here in America, by contrast, the average taxpayer will spend 13 hours and $200 to get their tax return finished and filed.
Past studies estimate that at least 40 percent of Americans would be eligible to get return-free filing, should we move to such a system. So why on Earth don't we?
That's where Intuit, H&R Block, and their ilk enter the picture. As ProPublica and the Sunlight Foundation have documented, the tax preparation industry spends millions upon millions lobbying Congress. And one of the main things they lobby against is moving to return-free filing. Multiple congressional attempts to create such a system have crashed and burned, including a 2016 effort by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and others. The industry even fought similar efforts at the state level, and pushed bills that would explicitly bar the U.S. government from embracing return-free filing.
America does have a public-private partnership between the IRS and the tax preparation companies, which ostensibly offers free online tax filing to lower- and middle-class families. But it's confusing. And, not surprisingly, it nudges users towards products that require payment. While 70 percent of Americans could use this option in theory, under 2 percent actually do. Meanwhile, the industry uses that partnership as leverage to get the IRS to sign agreements that it won't create a free-return system.
Warren called the setup "a front for tax prep companies who use it as a gateway to sell expensive products no one would even need if we'd just made it easier for people to pay their taxes.” Her staff even issued a long and detailed report based on much of ProPublica's work.
The tax preparation industry and its allies in Congress argue that making the IRS both tax collector and tax preparer would create a conflict of interest: The government wants more tax revenue, so it might inflate your tax liability by not giving you all the credits and deductions you qualify for. But both systems end at the same place: The government tells you what it thinks your liability is, and you either challenge it or you don't. In return-free filing systems as in our own, you don't have to accept the government's version. You can disagree, make adjustments, etc. Return-free filing just cuts out the nonsense beforehand.
Now, there's a more likely reason the industry opposes return-free filing: It would massively cut into their customer base and revenue. "We anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future," Intuit told its investors recently.
Even worse, poor Americans are particularly vulnerable to exploitation. First off, they desperately need what tax breaks they get, and have less time or resources than anyone to claim them. Second, in an echo of the problem with payday lenders, poor Americans often lack bank accounts and face other challenges that give tax preparation companies even more opportunities to fleece them.
In short, making the process of filing your taxes as unpleasant as possible is a very big and very lucrative business.
There were rumors posted on some gun forums last week that Para USA was “going under” and that Para USA double-column 1911-style pistols would no longer be made.
We can now put those rumors to rest thanks to a very candid press release from Remington.
At Remington Outdoor Company (“ROC”) we develop, manufacture and market the highest quality firearms, ammunition, and related products. We have built ROC by acquiring and cultivating great brands and products, such as the Remington 870 and 700, DPMS rifles, AAC suppressors, Barnes Bullets ammunition, Para USA handguns, and more while continuously investing in our people and facilities. In 2011 Remington re-entered the handgun market with the critically acclaimed R1 1911, an updated version of the 1911 Remington made for the US government in World War I. Most of ROC's new product launches and acquisitions have gone well, but they aren't always perfect and, candidly, we did a poor job with the Marlin factory relocation and the R51 launch. These were expensive but valuable. In 2012, with a goal of expanding its handgun line, ROC acquired Para USA (“Para”), a company that specialized in the production of competition, high capacity, and double action 1911-style pistols. Following Remington's acquisition, Para, which had been experiencing quality control issues, saw a steep decline in warranty claims. In 2014, ROC announced its new, world-class firearms center of excellence in Huntsville, Alabama. Here, Remington is integrating product development, engineering, production, and quality control – a first in Remington's 200-year history. The integration of modern sporting rifles, suppressors, and Remington pistols commenced immediately, and Para is scheduled to move to Huntsville next month. Para's products have a strong following due to their key technical and performance features, which are different than many 1911s, including Remington's own R1 line. ROC intends to keep these features and benefits that our customers have come to trust, while transferring Para's operations to Huntsville and rebranding Para to Remington. We have learned from our mistakes, listened to our customers, and have a clear plan to smoothly integrate Para. This includes keeping popular Para products, characteristics, and names such as the “Warthog,” while improving quality with state-of-the art machining and engineering in Huntsville, AL. Further, ROC will recognize and continue to support Para's Lifetime Warranty promise on all Para handguns.
In other words, Remington is integrating Para USA's pistols into the Remington 1911 line.
I think that this is going to be a great thing for fans of both Remington and Para USA.
Para has long been knocked by serious shooters for inconsistent quality control, and bringing the line in-house at the new Huntsville, AL location should make it easier to address those concerns and churn out a consistently higher quality pistol. I've recently fired an R1 (Remington's 1911) and I was impressed by the fit and finish of the pistol.
If this merger results in a single, much broader product line with better quality control, then I think this has to be viewed as a win for shooters.
In Uganda, gay people are being forced into exile. If a new bill becomes law, homosexuality will be punishable by death – which means many people are choosing to leave and seek asylum elsewhere
Five police officers force three young men out of their one-room slum dwelling in Kampala, with no explanation. As they are dragged down the slum's main shopping street, their neighbours' hateful shouts make their "crime" all too clear: "Beat those gays up!" "Kill those monsters!" "Give them what they deserve!"
Threats were also issued – threats they had heard before:
"We'll burn down your house!"
After two days in a small, dirty prison cell they are released. Now they've gone underground, and hope to gain asylum in another country.
"We don't dare to live here any more. We have felt unsafe for a long time and it only gets worse. It's all the talk about that law that agitates people. If it is passed I am sure they will burn down the house," says one, a 23-year-old transsexual who prefers to be called "Bad Black" for safety reasons.
The law he refers to is the so-called "Kill the Gays" bill, which is set to become reality in Uganda within days. It is already illegal to commit a homosexual act in the country, but a unified parliament now supports a tightening of the law, which, among other things, will make it punishable by death to be a "serial offender".
The parliamentarian behind the bill is David Bahati. He describes homosexuality as an evil that has to be fought. He also says that he and his peers "do not hate the homosexuals but the sin in them".
Bahati's reference to sin reveals the direct connection between Uganda's politicians and a group of very influential pastors. One of these pastors is Moses Solomon Male, who travels the country presenting his talk, Understanding the Challenges of Homosexuality (Sodomy).
"Those homosexuals … They call it anal sex. It ruins the anus. And they say they enjoy it," said Male in a recent speech to Sunday-school pupils in a Kampala suburb. He also described the cornerstone of both the pastors' and the politicians' argument against homosexuals: That they are "recruiting" innocents to their side – especially children.
LGBT rights advocates are doing their best to challenge these views – and the bill. One of these, transsexual activist Pepe Julian Onziema, has courageously come out with his message as well as his sexuality. Homosexuality is not something you become, it is something you are, he stresses.
"The only thing we can do is to try to inform as many people as possible about how we're human beings just like them – just with different sexual preferences," he explains.
In the original three "Spider-Man" movies, we got a good look into the life of Peter Parker. But in the first trailer for next year's new version, "The Amazing Spider-Man," we actually get to see through his eyes as he runs, climbs, and swings across the skyscrapers of New York City.
"The Amazing Spider-Man" takes the character of Peter Parker -- played this time by Andrew Garfield ("The Social Network") -- back to high school before he was bitten by a spider and given superpowers. But certain elements of his story are different than in the original movies. His crush is not Mary Jane Watson, but Gwen Stacy (played by Emma Stone). In the comic books, Peter met Gwen before he was introduced to Mary Jane.
Watch the trailer for 'The Amazing Spider-Man' >>
The first trailer focuses mostly on Peter's backstory, including a scene with his parents who died when he was just a boy. Their deaths, which was never addressed in the original trilogy, look to be an important story element here. After Peter was orphaned, he was raised by his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field). The preview also gives a look at Dr. Curt Conners (Rhys Ifans), but it only shows him before he's transformed into the movie's monstrous villain, The Lizard.
The preview shows Peter getting bit by the spider, developing his powers, and beginning to climb walls. But the big moment comes at the 1:40 mark, when you get a long point-of-view shot as Spider-Man races across rooftops. He leaps over city streets from one building to another, crawls across walls, and finally leaps and swings through the air. It's one unbroken shot, culminating with Spidey running into his own reflection in the mirrored glass of a skyscraper.
Watch the trailer in the video player below, two days before it hits movie theaters. And if you go see "Captain America: The First Avenger" this weekend, you might also catch the trailer playing in 3D before the movie. "The Amazing Spider-Man" opens on July 3, 2012.

The Toronto Maple Leafs filled out their depth chart by signing goaltender Jhonas Enroth on Monday afternoon.
Enroth, 28, will earn $750,000 on a one-year deal and is expected to be the No. 2 goalie in Toronto, behind new starter Frederik Andersen.
The veteran Swede spent last season with the Los Angeles Kings, registering a 7-5-1 record with a .922 save percentage in 16 games.
The Maple Leafs completely changed their goaltenders over the off-season, first trading for Andersen from the Anaheim Ducks before the 2016 NHL Draft and then later trading last year's starter, Jonathan Bernier, to the Ducks in exchange for a conditional pick.
Enroth has appeared in 118 career games (106 starts) with the Kings, Dallas Stars, and Buffalo Sabres.
He was originally selected in the second round (No. 46 overall) by Buffalo in the 2006 NHL Draft.
A few years ago at this time of year, a fellow mother in the schoolyard asked me if we were "doing the Elf" this Christmas. What was "the Elf," I asked.
The Elf on the Shelf, she told me, was this brilliant new thing: a children's book that includes a little toy elf that you, as parent, place in various locations around your home to keep an eye on your children. At night, the elf reports back to Santa whether the juniors have been naughty or nice. My friend's six-year-old son was having a ball with it and my friend was enjoying the felicitous impact it seemed to be having on his behaviour.
I made a mental note to avoid the Elf, which bore all the markings of a commercial Trojan Horse – let the thing into your house and become target of a merciless franchised assault. And indeed, last week while buying that marginal product known as a book, I bumped right into the Elf on the Shelf display case and saw with my own eyes what the empire has become: There's a movie, floor puzzle, cooking set, activity book and countless Barbie-style accoutrements including "classy capelet sets" for she-elves and "dapper tuxedos" for he-elves.

According to Fortune magazine, annual sales of Elf on the Shelf hit $16.6-million USD in 2011 and have continued to grow, as helium-filled Elves now routinely float over Macy's annual Thanksgiving Parade in New York and CBS runs an Elf on the Shelf animated feature as part of its holiday special.
Enjoying this, no doubt, are the Elf's creators, a mother and daughter team from Marietta, Ga., who, in 2005, self-published a cute little rhyming book based on their family tradition of having a toy elf sit around their house from Thanksgiving on, spying on the kids for Santa. "From my family to yours," Carol Aebersold writes benevolently in the introduction to the book.
Also enjoying this, apparently, are parents with a whole lot of time on their hands, who are bombarding social media with pictures of the best locations they have found for their family's Elf – cuddled up with the knives in the cutlery drawer or perched on the toilet seat, taking a cute little elven dump of red and white mints.
Meanwhile the critics are piping up. In this NSA-bedeviled age of the surveillance state, should we really be inviting non-familial agents into our own homes? Is it not pedagogically problematic to reward good behaviour with stuff?
If anyone ever needed a definition for first world problem, this would be it. But maybe one Elf-related question is worth asking: Why are we lining up in big-box stores in exurbia to buy something inferior to what our kids can happily supply themselves?
Children's imaginations are marvellous things. Feed and water a child and they develop one. It costs nothing and will provide that child with just the elf or non-elf they need for their Christmas purposes. Their elf will require no parent to relocate it every night or to find a top-secret storage space for the 11 non-Christmas months (and then remember where that was). The elf of a child's creation will not be beholden to some Georgian woman's definition of good behaviour – "you've said your prayers, helped to bake cookies or clean the stairs" – nor will it appear on Pinterest which, frankly, is a good thing.
The magic of Christmas rests largely on fictions and these should be fully enjoyed. Santa's elves have made a few fleeting appearances around our house in recent years, but they typically disappear behind the garage into the local raccoon lavatory before the sighting can be verified. That's as is should be. Christmas is a time of mystery.

This year's El Niño event is shaping up to be one of the strongest in recorded history, and its effects are making themselves apparent across the globe in the form of droughts, floods and changes in local weather patterns. A less talked-about consequence of warm ocean temperatures, however, is their effect on coral. Warm water can lead to widespread coral bleaching, and scientists are observing just this effect around one of the world's most ecologically unique islands.
Christmas Island, also known as Kiritimati, belongs to the collection of atolls forming the Pacific nation of Kiribati and is the largest atoll in the world. (It's not to be confused with the other Christmas Island, found in the Indian Ocean, which is most famous for its huge population of red crabs). It's home to a large and diverse array of corals, which scientists say are now suffering the extreme effects of this year's El Niño event, which are particularly strong in the area of the Pacific — close to the equator — where Christmas Island lies.
But while the pervasive bleaching going on in the area is worrying, scientists say the current conditions at Christmas Island offer a unique opportunity to learn about the way different types of corals respond to environmental stressors, which could lead to better conservation strategies for corals in a warming world.
A team of researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology, led by professor Kim Cobb, spent two weeks on Christmas Island in early November conducting photographic surveys of the corals there and installing devices to capture data on environmental conditions, such as temperature. While there, they discovered that 50 to 90 percent of the corals they observed had bleached, thanks to the warm-water effects of El Niño. Even more concerning, up to 30 percent were already dead at some sites.
This response was likely caused by the extreme increases in water temperature observed with this El Niño event, Cobb said. While water temperatures normally hover around 81 degrees Fahrenheit, she and her team measured temperatures up to 88 degrees during their expedition.
“The aggravating factors have been that these water temperatures have been a lot warmer than average for a very extended time, stretching back earlier into 2014,” Cobb said, noting that scientists thought for a time that there would be an El Niño event last year. “This has become a very extended warm period for this reef.”
Corals are living animals themselves, but they thrive by maintaining a symbiotic relationship with certain species of algae, who live inside the corals (incidentally giving them their brilliant colors) and provide them with energy and nutrients. But under certain types of environmental stress, including extreme water temperatures, corals will expel their algae, turning white, or “bleaching,” in the process.
Bleaching doesn't necessarily spell a death sentence for the coral — if conditions return to normal, they can recapture their algae and eventually recover. If conditions become too extreme or too prolonged, however, the coral can die, which is what is starting to happen around Christmas Island.
Luckily, there's still hope for recovery after the El Niño event ends, Cobb said. But she warned that it could take the reef up to a decade to get back to normal — and even then, scientists predict climate change will continue to ramp up ocean warming and acidification in the coming years, which is certainly “adding pressure,” she said.
Notably, different types of coral seem to respond to environmental stress in different ways, with some species handling it better than others. This effect has already been observed at Christmas Island, said Cobb. “It's…important to stress that some sites showed relatively minimal impact of this thermal stress, while other sites at the same island have had this devastating effect,” she said.
Scientists aren't totally sure why some corals seem hardier than others, but they do have some theories. One major idea is that different types of symbiotic algae handle stress better than others, said Julia Baum, an assistant professor of biology at the University of Victoria. It also seems likely that coral already stressed from other factors, such as pollution, are more susceptible to environmental changes like heat stress, she said.
Baum and Cobb have both spent extensive time conducting research on Christmas Island, and see a learning opportunity in the El Niño-related events going on there. They plan to team up for an expedition in March, along with other marine biologists and ecologists, that will conduct a more detailed survey in the hopes of better understanding which types of coral are the most resistant to stress and why.
Christmas Island may be one of the best places in the world for this kind of research, thanks to several key characteristics. First, it's home to a diverse collection of coral species, which are already showing differing responses to the El Niño event. Second, corals in different areas of the atoll are subject to differing levels of human pressures, such as heavy fishing and pollution, making it convenient to study the ways different stressors compound each other and affect a coral's ability to stand up to heat stress.
“We have 40 different sites around the entire atoll that basically span an unparalleled gradient in human disturbance, from the most degraded to most pristine,” Baum said. “You can go from site to site and basically see how coral reefs fall apart.”
The March expedition, which will include a diverse interdisciplinary team, according to Cobb, will include detailed measurements on temperature, salinity and other environmental factors. The scientists will also take samples from the corals to analyze in the lab in order to figure out what types of algae live inside them and how heat tolerant they might be. The scientists have already tagged certain corals and taken measurements on them during previous expeditions, so they've been able to follow the progress of certain colonies over time.
The insights from the Christmas Island expedition could give conservationists a huge leg up when it comes to protecting corals all over the globe in the future, especially in the context of a warming world.
“I think we need to be strategic about where we're implementing marine protected areas,” Baum said. “We could use the knowledge that we gain from this stress event to actually think about where are coral reefs likely to survive and thrive over the next 50 years of climate change and ensure that we really strongly protect those coral reefs.”
“And especially if we actually can provide definitive proof that minimizing background stressors helps corals survive these events, that provides a lot of ammunition for protecting coral,” she added.
It's classic scientific pragmatism in the face of an otherwise worrying situation. Christmas Island, among the world's other reefs, will only be subject to increasing environmental stress in the future — this year's El Niño event is a kind of window into what the future may be like for the planet's marine ecosystems. Nonetheless, the circumstances provide a clear opportunity for the kind of work that might make that future easier.
“In the coral reef world, the situation can seem dire a lot of the time,” Baum said. “And I think that in trying to convey that to the public, what's happened is that we sell out this very negative situation — which it is, and it's scary — but I think what we have the opportunity to do here is actually focus on the bright spots.”
The Larsen C Iceberg Is on the Brink of Breaking Off
The saga of the Larsen C crack is about to reach its stunning conclusion. Scientists have watched a rift grow along one of Antarctica's ice shelves for years. Now it's in the final days of cutting off a piece of ice that will be one of the largest icebergs ever recorded.
It's the latest dreary news from the icy underbelly of the planet, which has seen warm air and water reshape the landscape in profound ways.

The crack has spread 17 miles over the past six days, marking the biggest leap since January. It's also turned toward where the ice shelf ends and is within eight miles of making a clean break. There's not much standing in It's way either.
“The rift has now fully breached the zone of soft ‘suture' ice originating at the Cole Peninsula and there appears to be very little to prevent the iceberg from breaking away completely,” scientists monitoring the ice with Project MIDAS wrote on their blog.
The growth follows reports from early May that the crack across the ice shelf had sprouted a branch, further underscoring how unstable the ice is becoming. Ice shelves float over water and essentially act as doorstops that hold back the vast Antarctic ice sheet.
The breakup is sure to be a spectacle both awe-inducing and horrifying. The iceberg on the verge of splitting off is estimated to be the size of Delaware, covering an area of 1,930 square miles. That's equal to 10 percent of the ice shelf's total area.
Once it breaks off, scientists are concerned that the rest of ice shelf could collapse afterwards, a fate that befell Larsen A in 1995 and Larsen B in 2002. In Larsen B's case, the ice shelf collapsed in the span of a month following an influx of mild air.
In February, the New York Times reported that when the iceberg breaks off, it will weaken or destroy two key areas where ice overlaps islands. Those areas help keep the ice shelf from falling apart. Losing them could dramatically reduce the remaining ice shelf's stability. Larsen C is substantially larger than its former neighbors Larsen A and B, and its loss would be a huge blow to ice on the Antarctic Peninsula.
The changes don't just stop with the Larsen C crack or the Antarctic Peninsula in general. The vast majority of ice shelves are losing volume due to rising ocean and air temperatures. That's helped prime parts of West Antarctica for what might be unstoppable melt that could raise sea levels at least 10 feet.
Researchers also recently found meltwater ponds are much more common than previously thought. They even discovered a roaring seasonal waterfall on the Nansen Ice Shelf.
These and other findings make clear that the Larsen C crack is just one of many changes happening to Antarctica. Global warming has pushed temperatures up to 5°F higher in the region since the 1950s and they could increase up to 7°F further by the end of the century, putting more stress on ice.
Though the changes are happening in the most remote part of the planet, they're being felt thousands of miles away as ice turns to water and starts to lap against increasingly beleaguered coastal communities around the world. And the impacts will only grow more severe unless carbon pollution is reined in.
