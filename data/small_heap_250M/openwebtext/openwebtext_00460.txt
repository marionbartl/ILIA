Even though the venture capital world is in a frenzy — valuations are ballooning, more and more so-called “unicorns” are appearing every day — First Round Capital is staying the course.
That was the message managing partner Josh Kopelman sent in May to his venture capital firm's limited partners in his quarterly letter. It was leaked this week, racking up nearly 55,000 views on Scribd.
Here's Kopelman explaining his strategy:
He continued: “So even though there's almost a 10x increase in the availability of capital for seed-stage funds right now, we've chosen not to materially increase our fund size (our current fund is just 2.8% larger than our prior fund).”
He also noted that it's been First Round's slowest two quarters in six years, making just 10 investments since Q4 2014.
“We don't expect that our pace will permanently remain this low — already one month into Q2, we've seen an uptick in new investments,” he wrote.
Find more analysis here on the newly paywalled PandoDaily, which happens to be backed personally by Kopelman.

During Synod16, one thing we talked about at length was how parishes and the archdiocese could help create a church filled with joyful missionary disciples. Since then, I've reflected a lot on this question and come to the conclusion that our churches have to be different.
When someone new walks through the doors of our sanctuary, it needs to feel different than the social gathering space of the vestibule, it needs to be different than a local VFW hall, it needs to be different. It needs to feel sacred.
One of the things I love about Catholicism is it's a full sensory experience. We praise God with our eyes through reading scripture or watching the priest during consecration. We praise God with our ears through music or listening to the homily. We praise God with our mouths by singing or professing our faith. We praise God with smell by offering incense. We praise God with our touch by receiving Him in the Holy Eucharist.
When we walk into a church for Mass or private prayer, the silence of the sanctuary is a reminder that this isn't about us. It's different. It's drawing our focus to the mystery of Christ in the Eucharist being present in the Tabernacle. If we're telling people that He is truly present in our church, then reverence to the Eucharist makes an impact on that experience.
“Even before the celebration itself, it is commendable that silence be observed in the church, in the sacristy, in the vesting room, and in adjacent areas, so that all may dispose themselves to carry out the sacred action in a devout and fitting manner.” General Instruction of the Roman Missal Number 45
In addition to silence, we must ensure our church is beautiful. That our tabernacles are out, accounted for, and properly reverenced. That our whole congregation acts as if they are actually in the presence of God. Those things will reinforce the personal testimonies that we share.
Thankfully, I'm not the only one who thinks beauty can point us to truth. It's part of a lot of Catholic philosophy. Pope Benedict said in 2008 that there is an “urgent need for a renewed dialogue between aesthetics and ethics, between beauty, truth and goodness.”
My biggest fear in evangelization is this:
I share my personal faith journey with someone, complete with the amazement of Jesus Christ present in the Eucharist. Maybe it's a one off conversation, maybe it's a continuous relationship. It starts something in their heart. Maybe it's that next Sunday, maybe it's in 10 years. They seek out Mass. Maybe we've lost touch, maybe they don't want to get my hopes up that they're interested, maybe they're just not comfortable telling me. They walk into Mass and are confused. The way I described Jesus's presence is not portrayed in the Church they went to. It's just feeling like another place, not the mystery and mystical experience they were told about. And then they're lost and my credibility as a Catholic is shattered.
I don't think beauty means it has to be fancy European-style architecture. Simplicity is beautiful. The key is to make sure the sanctuary is different. It's prayerful. It's beautiful. Both of the pictured churches have been key parishes in my faith journey. They both have very different physical characteristics, but both have a few things in common, including the prominence of the tabernacle and a proclivity for quiet before Mass.
St. Mary's, Mt. Pleasant St. Hyacinth, Detroit
My prayer these days is that every church may be beautiful in proclaiming the True Presence of Christ. If the New Evangelization is going to work, then churches everywhere will have to be ready for the seeds of evangelization to sprout.

Olivia Chow says she continues to think about running for mayor of Toronto, but is nowhere near formally throwing her hat into the ring.
The NDP MP and transportation critic made the comment to CP24 during an interview Wednesday afternoon.
“I am thinking about that. Yes I am,” Chow told CP24 when asked about her possible city hall ambitions. “In the meantime, I am thinking about subways, streetcars, buses, fixing the Gardiner and renewing the sewage system so your basement doesn't flood next time there is a storm.”
A former city councillor, Chow has been long rumoured as a possible candidate in the 2014 municipal election and has topped the list of possible contenders in a number of polls conducted in recent months.
Asked if she was laying the groundwork for a campaign Wednesday, Chow was coy.
“I am laying the groundwork to get some extra dollars back from federal government to Toronto,” she said. “As an MP that's what I want to do, get some money back to Toronto.”
Candidates can't officially register for the 2014 municipal election until January 2.
Others who have openly discussed entering the race include former Ontario Progressive Conservative party leader John Tory, TTC Chair Karen Stintz and Public Works Chair Denzil Minnan-Wong.
The settlers on the frontier must survive the harsh conditions that frontier life brings and they must get along with the sometimes friendly and sometimes fierce wild animals that come around. Pa often goes out to the woods to look for food while ma fixes dinner and the children help with the chores around their cozy log cabin. They all work hard to survive the harsh conditions, and to make this new land feel more like home.
About the Project
The Settler's Frontier Cabin, is designed to show a different side of the various western themes and lines that LEGO has sold in the past. This build focuses more on the settlers who moved west in hopes of finding new and better land where they could build a home and begin a new life.
My goal for this The Settler's Frontier Cabin was to design a one room log cabin similar to the log cabins that settlers would build as they headed west across North America, while still maintaining playability. As much detail as possible was included, keeling the goal of playability in mind. This build includes frontier family (frontiersman, frontier woman, son, daughter, and infant child), brown bear, water well with bucket, firewood, frontier tomahawk, tree and stump, cooking pot and pan, turkey drumsticks, table and chair, wood box, fireplace, rifles, bed with patchwork quilt, infant cradle, and loft with ladder. The roof, rear wall, and loft come out so you can see and play inside.
Your support and comments are greatly appreciated.

SAN FRANCISCO (BCN) A suspicious incident near San Francisco's Hall of Justice was deemed safe this afternoon after a police response that prompted the shutdown of Interstate Highway 80 and U.S. Highway 101 in the area, police said.
Officers responded shortly before 11 a.m. to a parking lot near Seventh and Harrison streets underneath Highway 80 after receiving suspicious information about a vehicle there, San Francisco police spokeswoman Officer Giselle Talkoff said.
More details about what exactly prompted the police response were not immediately available from the Police Department, which sent its bomb squad to investigate.
Highway 80 was closed along with U.S. Highway 101 in the area. Northbound traffic on Highway 101 was diverted to Interstate Highway 280 and city streets, while westbound Highway 80 traffic was diverted to the Fifth Street off-ramp, according to the California Highway Patrol.
The highways reopened as of 2:20 p.m. and minutes later, San Francisco police said that the scene had been deemed safe and all shelter-in-place orders were lifted.
One of the locations locked down was the Hall of Justice at 850 Bryant St., although authorities eventually allowed people to leave the building. Court hearings there were postponed until Friday, San Francisco Superior Court officials said.

Michael Bisping fought Rashad Evans at light-heavyweight © Getty Images Enlarge
Rashad Evans has warned Chael Sonnen that he cannot possibly anticipate how good Michael Bisping is, but he still predicts the American will "maul" Bisping at UFC on Fox 2.
Evans fights in the main event on Saturday against Phil Davis. Victory will book him a shot at Jon Jones' light-heavyweight title.
The former 205lb champion has shared an Octagon with Bisping in the past, when the Brit used to operate at the light-heavyweight limit, and Evans only snuck by him via a decision. Indeed, Bisping still finds plenty of sympathisers to his claim that he beat Evans.
Casting a previewing eye over the Sonnen v Bisping encounter, which sees the winner earn a title shot against Anderson Silva, Evans swatted away the suggestion that it is a one-sided fight.
"Bisping is a scrapper man and that's one thing people don't really realise," Evans told the Bleacher Report. "You can't watch a Bisping tape and get a true appreciation for just how good he really is until you're in there. And by then, it's usually too late.
"He's very tricky and he's a lot better than what he looks. You underestimate him because he doesn't look strong but he's surprisingly pretty strong."
Having complimented Bisping, it shows exactly how highly Evans rates Sonnen that he still predicts victory for the American this weekend.
"For me I think the pressure Chael Sonenn brings is hard to match with his offense, takedowns, ground and pound, hand in the face and dropping elbows and shots," Evans explained. "It kind of wears down a fighter. And, if he does that to Bisping too much, I think he'll be able to maul him."

CLEVELAND, Ohio – The Indians have made it clear that it will take an exceptional set of circumstances for Francisco Lindor to make the big-league club out of spring training this year, but that did not stop them from inviting the switch-hitting shortstop to camp for the second straight season.
No. 1 picks Lindor and outfielder Tyler Naquin were among seven minor-leaguers invited to big-league camp Tuesday. The others are catcher Jake Lowery, outfielder James Ramsey, right-hander Will Roberts, infielder Ryan Rohlinger and outfielder Jordan Smith.
The Indians, to date, will bring 20 spring training invitees to camp in Goodyear, Ariz. Pitchers and catchers report on Feb. 18.
Lindor, the Indians' No.1 pick in 2011, is rated as the team's top prospect by Baseball America and several other media outlets. The Indians, however, are in no rush to bring him to the big leagues. He's played only 38 games at Class AAA Columbus last year and the Indians are happy with shortstop Jose Ramirez, 22.
"Lindor gets talked about a lot," said manager Terry Francona at the Indians Town Hall meeting Monday. "It's kind of cool because there's a reason he's a high-profile prospect based on what he's done in his journey through the minor leagues.
"But he's still a prospect. We need to let him develop. Getting a guy here too quick isn't developing, that's getting him beat up. When Lindor gets here, we want him to impact our team offensively, defensively and on the bases. That takes time."
Last year Lindor, 21, hit a combined .276 (140-for-567) with 16 doubles, four triples, 11 homers and 62 RBI at Class AA Akron and Columbus. He scored 75 runs and stole 28 bases in 126 games.
In the Arizona Fall League, he hit .265 (26-for-93) with three homers and nine RBI.
Naquin, the Indians' No.1 pick in 2012, had his 2014 season interrupted by a broken left hand when a pitch hit him. Naquin, 23, was hitting .313 (95-for-304) with 12 doubles, five triples and 30 RBI at Akron when he was injured. He stole 14 bases and scored 54 runs in 76 games.
In winter ball, Naquin hit .220 (9-for-41) in the Dominican Republic with Gigantes del Cibao.
Lowery, 24, had his 2014 season interrupted by injury as well. He was hit in the face by a pitch on April 18 and missed seven weeks. Lowery hit .201 (44-for-219) with five homers and 19 RBI in 66 games at Akron.
The Indians acquired Ramsey, 25, from St. Louis for Justin Masterson on July 30. He hit a combined .295 (104-for-352) with 23 doubles and 16 homers for Class AA Springfield and Columbus. Ramsey missed three weeks last season with St. Louis because of an abdominal injury.
Your browser does not support iframes.
Roberts, 24, went 12-12 with a 4.08 ERA in 27 starts at Akron. He pitched an Eastern-League high 161 innings and led Akron in starts and strikeouts.
Rohlinger, 31, was invited to be league camp after re-signing with the Tribe after last season. He hit .233 (68-for-292) with 16 doubles, five homers and 27 RBI last year for Columbus.
He's been in the big leagues with the Giants for parts of the 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons.
Smith hit .248 (11-for-459) with 24 doubles, two homers and 50 RBI in 26 games last year for Akron. In the Arizona Fall League, he hit .304 (21-for-69) with one homer and 10 RBI.
Here's the breakdown on the spring training invitees:
Pitchers (nine): Lefties Scott Downs, Michael Roth and Nick Maronde and righties Jeff Manship, Shaun Marcum, Dustin Molleken, Bryan Price, Will Roberts and Anthony Swarzak.
Catchers (three): Brett Hayes, Lowery, Adam Moore and Audy Ciriaco.
Infielders (four): Lindor, Rohlinger, Audy Ciriaco and Jerry Sands.
Outfielders (four): Naquin, Ramsey, Jordan.
((Signups to help Ellis take on the guys that killed his brother. Not part of the event. Expect interviews.))
Three days.
Three days on constant moving, and killing everything that was living and got into his way. Ellis brother, Johnny; the one who watched over him, protected him, and helped him his entire life, was killed right in front of Elliss eyes and Ellis didnt do a damn thing to help him.
Now, he was nearing the outskirts of Bucket town coming upon a small pre-war house. It was only one story, the type that the government made for the returning veterans as a place to live after they came from Alaska.
Ellis moved towards the frontdoor, gripping his homemade shotgun. Kicking it in, Ellis moved into what was once the living room, as evident by the TV in the living room. Inside, a small family sat on the couch looking up at the swamper.
A tense moment passed, as the father and Ellis looked at each other.
Daddy, whos this man? A small girl asked, looking up at Ellis.
Katie, were leaving. Now. The father said, picking up the small child and heading for the kicked indoor. A woman passed Ellis, bumping shoulders with him. Ignoring that, Ellis grabbed the father by the shoulder and looked him in the eye.
Do me a favor. Spread the word that I need some friends to help me with something. When I leave, you get the house back. I wont be here for long. Ellis said, his eyes hollow and his tone indifferent.
The mans wife passed Ellis, bumping shoulders with him. Ignoring that, Ellis sat down on the couch and placed his hands on his face and his elbows on his knees. His eyes welled with tears for his dead brother, who was now problay laying in the courtyard with his dead wife.
Breathing deeply in an attempt to calm himself, all that Ellis could think about was the clan leader pulling the trigger on Elliss brother. Flipping over the coffee table that was in front of him with one arm, Ellis smashed in the TV with his foot before throwing a random chair out of a sliding glass door. That was bound to attract somebody watching.
So, it's been a year since Buggerlugs was born. It feels as though I should be taking a moment to reflect on the transformations wrought, the life lessons learned, the great mysteries of existence penetrated and the eternal verities at their hearts revealed. That sort of thing, you know?
Unfortunately, the greatest surprise of the past 12 months has been how utterly unchanged I am – except at the superficial level on which nappy-changing, food-puréeing and night-feeding operate. I think this is because most of the things that stagger new parents were already present in abundance in my life. To wit:
1. Guilt There's nothing you can teach me about guilt. Guilt is the fuel I run on. For as long as I can remember, I have lain in bed greeting each new dawn by running through a mental checklist of all the ways I am failing myself, my loved ones and the world at large. Don't have a pension. Don't recycle, support my sister or vacuum the stairs enough. I'm overweight and behind with all my domestic, administrative and professional tasks. I'm selfish, lazy and still haven't found the moral courage to give up my job and retrain as something worthwhile, such as a teacher or social worker. And I lie in bed too long worrying self-indulgently. Once the surging tide of nameless remorse, shame and generalised culpability has subsided to manageable proportions, I get up. If it ever receded completely, I don't know whether I would find myself gasping and choking to death, unable to breathe on dry land, or quickly, joyously sprouting new legs and scurrying off to explore this strange and beautiful new world.
So you can't daunt me with the constant fear of failing a bundle of helpless new life that I've ushered unasked into the world! Pah – 'tis but a bagatelle.
2. Chaos If anything, having a baby has imposed more, not less, order on life. There are now three, relatively evenly-spaced points in the day at which food happens in our house, where there never were before. Bins get emptied, papers and assorted other detritus put away, leftovers refrigerated. If I don't, the baby will eat something bad, slip on something or stab himself with something and die. It is a spur to decluttering, I can tell you.
3. Curtailment of liberty This is a problem only if you ever used your liberty while you had it. I once spent eight straight days indoors. I noticed only when I walked through a shaft of sunlight coming in down the side of a half-fallen-down blind and flinched like a Mogwai being splashed with water. An infant would have to try a lot harder than this one to put a crimp in that sort of style.
So I cannot say that the lustre of my social life or the glamour of my evenings has been noticeably dimmed. The imminent end of Desperate Housewives may reduce its wattage slightly, but this is hardly the baby's fault.
Of course, this only goes to show how very much better at life other people have always been than I am. I feel genuinely sorry for anyone who has been busted down to my standards overnight by the advent of offspring. If it helps, you become used to the guilt after a while. It wears a sort of calloused groove in your soul, always aching but never sharply painful. Takes about 10 years. You're very welcome.
Four state Registry of Motor Vehicle clerks along with two other people were arrested Wednesday after authorities say they were making false identifications through the registry and selling them to people living in the country illegally, some of whom had been deported in the past.
Some of those phony licenses and identifications were used to fraudulently register to vote in Boston, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.
Evelyn Medina, 56, of Boston; Annette Gracia, 37, of Boston; Kimberly Jordan, 33, of Randolph; David Brimage, 46, of Boston; Bivian Yohanny Brea, 41, of Boston; and a 32-year-old man identified as John Doe were all charged in federal court with aggravated identity theft.
Officials are still trying to determine John Doe's true identity and list multiple aliases for him.
Medina, Gracia, Jordan, and Brimage were employed as clerks at the Haymarket Registry of Motor Vehicles. Authorities said Brea and Flako worked with the RMV clerks to operate the scheme.
The case against the six people began after Massachusetts State Police received an anonymous letter in October 2015 claiming a "corrupt RMV employee" was providing stolen identifications and drivers' license to people seeking the phony documents.
"An investigation revealed that several Haymarket RMV clerks - Medina, Gracia, Jordan, and Brimage - were allegedly working with Brea, who acted as the document vendor, and Flako, who acted as the document dealer, to provide licenses and identification cards to illegal aliens for cash," the U.S. Attorney's Office said.
Flako, according to authorities, worked as the document dealer. Flako allegedly sold a Puerto Rican birth certificate and U.S. Social Security card to Brea, the document vendor, for approximately $900.
Brea, in turn, sold the stolen identities for more than $2,000 to clients seeking legitimate identities in Massachusetts. These clients included people living in the country illegally, individuals who were previously deported, and an individual who admitted to previously facing drug charges.
Brea allegedly also used the fake documents to register people to vote in Boston. The four RMV workers are accused of accepted cash to illegally issue authentic RMV documents - licenses and identification cards.
"The clerks also accepted cash to use the RMV's system to run queries, including Social Security number audits, to confirm that the identities the clients were stealing actually belonged to verifiable individuals," the U.S. Attorney's Office said.
The investigation into the corruption and identity theft scheme is ongoing.

Do you want to remote into your Raspberry Pi and see a graphical desktop? It's actually really easy. If you don't want to dedicate a monitor or the TV to the pi but still want to use it, here's your solution.
My New Course: Hands on Internet of Things with the Raspberry Pi
I have just released my new course titled ”Hands on Internet of Things” which is intended to be a course for people who want to get started with IoT. I'll take you through blinking lights and reading sensors to creating YOUR own IoT endpoint and dashboard. I'm offering this special coupon for readers of my site: get %50 off this course here.

Ok, another Raspberry Pi article. Due to the overwhelming response I'm going to keep putting stuff up here as I hack and play around, and hopefully it gets people even more stoked about this awesome product. If these tutorials seem “too basic” remember they're not targeted at hardcore techies, they're geared towards kids and newbies, which all of us were at one time.
Anyway, so let's say you're like me and you have a bunch of computers around all the time. You have your Raspberry Pi that you want to play around with but you don't want to fiddle back and forth with cables or hook it to your TV, well this method will let you have a graphical desktop on your own desktop of your PC or Laptop like this:
Pretty cool, right? Let's get started.
Configure the Pi
Make sure your Pi is connected to the Internet, and your local network containing the other machines you want to connect with.
To set this up, you'll need the Pi to run a service that your other computers can connect to. I'm using Raspian Wheezy for this, as I do with most of my tutorials.
I chose xrdp for this, as I've had good experiences with it in the past. To install it in Raspian, you simply type:
sudo apt-get install xrdp
This will install everything you need on the Pi. It will start up every time you start up your Raspberry Pi.
Now get your IP address
ifconfig eth0 | grep inet | cut -c21-30
Remember this IP as you'll need to use it to find your Pi from another machine.
Connect to the Pi with Windows
You can connect to the machine from multiple environments; I suspect most beginners will be using a Windows system.
To start simply go to
Start -> All Programs -> Remote Desktop Connection
Put your IP address in the box:
And connect! You may see a message saying the remote computer cannot be verified like this:
You can safely ignore it. It comes up because your Raspberry Pi is running Linux, instead of Windows which is what remote desktop expects.
You should get the following screen next:
Log in, and you're ready to go!
Connect to the Pi with Linux
If you want to connect to your Pi from Linux that's equally easy.
I generally use rdesktop to connect. If you're using Ubuntu or another Debian based installation, type in
sudo apt-get install rdesktop
After that installs, type in the following:
rdesktop < the IP address of your Pi >
You'll see the familiar xrdp screen again.
If you are running a different distribution you can always build it from source, the latest version as of this writing is rdesktop 1.7.1 and it's a pretty easy setup.
Connect to the Pi with Mac OSX
I don't actually have a Mac to test this on, but you can find something like CoRD that should work just fine.
I will try to get my hands on an OSX machine soon and find a good solution for this.
Additional Options
One thing you may notice is the Pi can go really high with it's screen resolution, possibly higher than your monitor will allow. This will make it so you have to scroll around and end up with something like this:
Obviously not a great solution right? Well in Windows, you can adjust your resolution settings in Remote Desktop fairly easily. Click on the Options dropdown:
And select the “Display” tab:
You will see a slider with multiple options for resolution and color. Then go back to the General tab and click “save” to save your changes.
In linux you can pass some parameters to the command:
rdesktop -r 1024x768 < the IP address of your Pi >
and rdesktop will automatically resize to whatever resolution you want.
Why use RDP?
Someone may ask this, and it's a valid question. If you're running Linux and want to connect a Linux machine, why use a Microsoft protocol? The reason I suggest using xrdp is because it's fast, stable and works well with multiple operating systems. There are several other VNC options you can use but for simplicity I chose this one, and it works well on both Windows and Linux machines.
Summary
I hope this has helped answer your questions about running your Pi as a virtual desktop. If you're like me you might have your Pi stashed away somewhere and it's more convenient to make it headless. For me it sits in my “datacenter” (the closet in my office) amongst other equipment, so when I want to play with my Pi, I either SSH into it or use RDP and it works great.
Till next time, keep sending me ideas and feedback!

This is NOT a haunted house.
This is NOT the same event as the smash-hit “This is Real” from 2016-2017
This is it's own thing. This is an “out-of-town tryout” in COLD SPRING, NY for an actual haunted house we intend on doing in NYC next year where you walk through blindfolded. This is not that. It is only a conceptual experiment of the concept, but much smaller and very intimate. You will be blindfolded the whole time. Your other senses will be engaged, including taste, but you will not be traveling through a maze like you will be in the future. This is largely static, but you will be engaged the entire time. It will last around 30 minutes where you are given some intense attention the entire time.
Psycho Clan will be producing a series of shows in the future under the aegis of This is Real, as shows that try and achieve a higher level of reality than traditional theatrical or haunted house experiences.
This is Not a Haunted House, but it is a horror experience just in time for the Halloween season.
She is seeking $12,500 in a test case, and as many as 140 former East German athletes, including Krieger, are deciding whether to file similar complaints. Last month, a state court in Frankfurt ruled that König's case could proceed. Indications are that the case could be settled out of court, according to German news reports.
Jens Steinigen, König's lawyer, said in a telephone interview that he was also exploring the possibility of suing the pharmaceutical company VEB Jenapharm, formerly state-run and now a subsidiary of the Schering AG Group. According to evidence in the criminal trials of the late 1990's, Jenapharm produced the steroid Oral-Turinabol that was given to East German athletes.
''We won't be able to make these wrongs undone, but the athletes can still use the money for medicine or therapy,'' Steinigen said.
As Krieger sees it, no amount of money could restore his health, which he considers harmed by steroid use and secondary effects. He experiences such intense discomfort in his hips and thighs, from lifting massive amounts of weight while on performance-enhancing drugs, that he can no longer sleep on his side. Only the mildest physical exertion is tolerable. Long unemployed, he now works two days a week as a clerk for a real estate agent.
On Tuesday, the same day that President Bush called for an end to steroid abuse in American sports in his State of the Union address, Krieger again told his own story, feeling compelled to shed more light on one of the darkest chapters in the history of performance-enhancing drugs.
As many as 10,000 East German athletes were involved in a state-sponsored attempt to build a country of 16 million into a sports power rivaling the United States and the Soviet Union, recent trials and documents of the East German secret police have revealed.
An estimated 500 to 2,000 former East German athletes are believed to be experiencing significant health problems associated with steroids, including liver tumors, heart disease, testicular and breast cancer, gynecological problems, infertility, depression and eating disorders. Some female athletes have reported miscarriages and have had children born with deformities like club feet.

In 2002, two years after the criminal trials ended, the German government established a compensation fund of $2.5 million for the doping victims, with a maximum payout of $12,500. Only 311 athletes, however, made claims -- Krieger among them -- by the deadline of March 31, 2003, according to Birgit Boese, a board member of Doping Victim Aid, an assistance group.
Some athletes were unaware of the fund, while others were embarrassed, afraid of losing their jobs, unable to gain full access to their medical files or unsuccessful in convincing doctors that their ailments were directly related to steroid use, Boese said.
''There was a lot of denial and still is,'' Boese said of the athletes. ''Many have never, or only now, understood that they were abused by people they trusted.''
Some of the most outspoken have faced harassment and threats. Ines Geipel, a retired East German sprinter who chronicled the doping system in a book, ''Lost Games,'' said she had been confronted at readings in 2001 by former East German officials. As recently as Jan. 18, she said, an anonymous phone caller told her, ''You know there is not much time left for you.''
Neither she nor Krieger has been deterred.
''People should know what happened, what side effects can be generated,'' Krieger said, speaking through an interpreter inside a concrete-block apartment building left from the Communist days in Magdeburg, a 90-minute train ride west of Berlin.
As Andreas, he has a goatee, wide shoulders and a narrow waist, and is handsome in a Three Musketeers kind of way. Told this, his wife, Ute Krause, said, ''D'Artagnan,'' and he gestured as if sword fighting, saying ''en garde'' to an imaginary foe.
When discussing the effects of doping, Andreas became serious and animated, sometimes emotional, smoking cigarettes and nervously rubbing his palms. When he was Heidi Krieger, scratching of the hands became a compulsive act and sometimes drew blood.
Though Krieger said he was happy, his life remains complicated. At 38, he is married to Krause, 41, a former East German swimmer. They met in Berlin at the criminal trials. Before Ute and Andreas were wed, he explained to her teenage daughter, Katja, that he, too, was once a girl. Katja accepted his explanation and her mother and Andreas married in May 2002.

Theirs began as a desperate kind of love. Ute and Andreas were former elite athletes, damaged by steroids, betrayed by coaches and officials they trusted and eager to testify against them. Both were once given to thoughts of suicide. They leaned on each other for information and support during the trials. Both had come to believe their drug-fueled performances were no longer legitimate.
Andreas's gold medal from the 1986 European championships, now part of a trophy designed as a steroid molecule, is given as an annual award to Germans involved in anti-doping efforts. Ute keeps a framed certificate of her 1978 world rankings in the backstroke in a symbolic location, over the toilet.
He is glad that he became a man, Krieger said, explaining that Heidi felt out of place and longed in some vague way to be a boy. What makes Krieger angry, Krause said, is a belief that the steroids essentially made the decision for Heidi, leaving her unable to sort out her sexual identity on her own.
''They pushed her out of her sex,'' said Geipel, the former sprinter and writer who is a friend of Krieger's.
A Teenager's Torment
In 1979, at age 14, Heidi Krieger began attending the Sports School for Children and Youth in Berlin. It was affiliated with the powerful sports club Dynamo, which was sponsored by the Stasi, the East German secret police.
At 16, Heidi began to receive round blue pills wrapped in foil. This was the steroid Oral-Turinabol, but coaches typically called them vitamins that would increase strength and help the athletes endure the stress of training. In Heidi's case, the Oral-Turinabol was given in tandem with birth control pills.
Six months later, Heidi's clothes no longer fit and she felt ''like the Michelin Man or a stuffed goose,'' Krieger said. By the time she was 18, she weighed 220 pounds, had a deep voice, increased body and facial hair and appeared mannish. On the streets of Berlin, Krieger said, Heidi was derisively called a homosexual or a pimp. Once on a commuter train, in the presence of her mother, she was called a drag queen. She went home, removed her skirt and never wore one again.

At the airport in Vienna, where Heidi had gone for a track meet, a flight attendant gave her directions to the men's bathroom. Even later, as she considered a sex-change operation, Krieger said, a psychologist asked, ''So you want to change from a man to a woman?''
The insults stung, but Heidi kept taking the blue pills. She had wild mood swings, from depression to aggression to euphoria. Once, she swiped at a boxer who had taunted her. When she stopped taking the birth control pills, her breasts began to hurt severely. She felt out of place at the sports school and in her own body, but the shot-put was a way to measure up, to fit in. By 1986, she had become the European champion.

''The only thing I could do was sports,'' Krieger said. ''I got to travel, I received recognition. I got the feeling that I belonged. That's what I wanted, to belong. From my point of view, I deserved it. I had worked hard. To question whether these were hormones I was being given, I didn't ask or suspect.''
Clearly, though, the steroids had a profound effect on her performances. And Heidi received drugs in large doses. As a 16-year-old, she put the shot just over 46 feet. Three years later, she pushed beyond 65 feet 6 inches. Trainers and doctors referred to her as Hormone Heidi.
According to medical research records uncovered by Brigitte Berendonk, a onetime West German Olympian, and her husband, Dr. Werner Franke, a molecular biologist from Heidelberg, Heidi Krieger received 2,590 milligrams of Oral-Turinabol in 1986, the year she won the European championship.
''That's about 1,000 milligrams more than Ben Johnson got in 1988,'' Franke said in a telephone interview, referring to the Canadian sprinter who was stripped of his gold medal at the Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, after testing positive for the steroid stanozolol.
After the Fall
Eventually, Heidi's powerful muscles and strenuous workouts began to overwhelm her joints and skeletal system. Retrieving a training log from June 1988, Krieger displayed a regimen indicating that Heidi lifted more than 100 tons of weights in a two-week period. Such physical strain took a toll on her knees, hips and back, and by 1991, her career ended.
That same year, Berendonk's seminal book about East German doping, ''From Research to Cheat,'' appeared. But even after Heidi's mother showed her the book, which detailed Heidi's steroid dosage, she did not want to believe that her performances had been achieved through doping rather than simply by skill and determination.
''Even then, I was in denial,'' Krieger said.
Retired, unemployed, the social safety net of her country no longer available to soften her fall after reunification, Heidi began to experience a deepening sense of dislocation, despair and ambiguity about her sexual identity. She never had a relationship with a man. She did have relationships with two women, but did not consider herself a lesbian, Krieger said.
By 1994, Heidi grew so depressed one day that she filled her tub with water and sat inside with a razor blade, intending to slit her wrists, seeing the blood flow in her mind, Krieger said. At that moment, Heidi's dog, a shepherd named Rex, nuzzled her arm, signaling it was time for a walk.

''The dog nudged me with that cold nose and it was like a shock, like I woke up from a dream,'' Krieger said.
In 1995, Heidi met a transsexual and began considering a sex-change operation, Krieger said. Two years later, she had her breasts removed and underwent a hysterectomy and other surgical procedures to begin the process of becoming a man known as Andreas.
Eventually, Andreas accepted that Heidi's athletic performances had been fraudulent. This left him feeling sad and angry, Krieger said. Heidi had trusted her coaches and trainers as if they were surrogate parents. But the officials gave her drugs that pushed her in a certain direction, Krieger said, denying her the most important decision she could make.
''I didn't have control,'' Krieger said. ''I couldn't find out for myself which sex I wanted to be.''
By May 30, 2000, Andreas was ready to confront in a Berlin courtroom the former East Germany's top sports official, Manfred Ewald, and the top sports doctor, Manfred Höppner. As described in the book ''Faust's Gold,'' (St. Martin's Press, 2001) written by an American psychologist, Dr. Steven Ungerleider, Andreas had a dramatic encounter with the presiding judge.
First, Andreas presented a wrinkled photograph of himself as Heidi. Then he said of the East German officials, ''They just used me like a machine.''
He described hating his body, and spoke of a mind ''crazy with panic,'' filled with thoughts of suicide. He told of the sex-change procedure, and in a moment of brutal poignancy, said of his mother, ''She says no matter who I am, boy or girl, she will always love me.''
Ewald and Höppner were both convicted of accessory to the intentional bodily harm of athletes and were given probation. Upon testifying, Andreas said he lost his fear of the two men. And he got some confirmation of his beliefs from the verdicts.

''The words used in court were that the giving of relatively high doses of Oral-Turinabol to a girl around puberty has significantly contributed to development into transsexuality,'' said Franke, the molecular biologist whose research into the East German doping system formed the basis of the criminal prosecutions.
Although the complex decision to have a sex change could not precisely be connected to steroids, the psychologist Ungerleider said, ''Emotional fallout from high levels of testosterone can make people unsure who they are.''
Facing Life Today
In a twist to his story, Andreas Krieger is again receiving hormones every three weeks, this time as therapeutic injections to maintain his maleness. The hormones are more benign versions of the testosterone derivatives that East German officials fed him. He still feels depression near the end of each hormonal cycle, and he worries that he is at a higher risk of cancer.
Still, Andreas said, ''It's better than I had before.''
In Krause, his wife, and her daughter, Katja, he has a renewed sense of family and belonging. And Ute understands what Andreas experienced as an athlete in a way that does not need words. As a swimmer, she had her own problems, developing bulimia in an attempt to stem weight gain from steroids. She struggled with bulimia for 20 years, she said, and once tried to kill herself by swallowing sleeping pills and vodka.
''Since we have been together, she has not thrown up,'' Andreas said.
Ute manages a pair of nursing homes as Andreas struggles to find a job in graphic design in a region with high unemployment. When they watch sports, it is with a certain skepticism about doping. Now, when he sees a woman throw the shot more than 65 feet, Andreas said, ''I know this is not only from drinking water.''
He is adamant that athletes caught using drugs should be treated as criminals and banned permanently from sports. And he considers it hypocritical for other countries to hire coaches from the former East Germany. Through it all, Andreas keeps Heidi close, memories pressed between the pages of a scrapbook.
''I have to accept that Heidi is part of my history,'' Andreas said. ''The more open I am, the fewer problems I have. Less than if I try to deny her.''
Fourth in a massive series on the media's treatment of Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Recent days have seen some thoroughly reported work on Clintonland — a profile in New York Magazine featuring the first big post-State Department interview for the former secretary and a deep story in the New Republic about Doug Band, a longtime aide to Bill Clinton whose work could complicate the political future of Hillary Rodham Clinton. And in the midst of the big takeouts, there's a lot of cable chatter.
Today's “Morning Joe” featured a dose of the latter in all its un-glory. Responding to a question about whether tea party opposition to Democrats might subside a bit if Hillary Clinton jumped into the presidential race, “Morning Joe” panelist Cokie Roberts proclaimed, “I also think — and just calling it — that some of this tea party anger is racist and that having a non-black person on the ticket will defuse it to some degree.”
Host Joe Scarborough took issue, citing all the “awful things” that he and fellow then-Republicans said about President Bill Clinton in the '90s. “There is nothing I've heard said about Barack Obama that we didn't take 10 degrees further,” said the host.
And just to keep this Hillary Clinton story addled with throwaway platitudes, Scarborough explored the dynamics of presidential ambition: “There's something that happens between that stage where Hillary Clinton is Hillary Clinton, not running for president, very likable — and the second she starts to take that step over, she looks calculated, looks stiff, looks Machiavellian. It's just like a light switch goes on.”

Shrewd Moves and Differentials: Gameweek 36 FPL Tips – Fantasy Premier League Tips
This is probably the first and last time you'll ever see Chelsea's Eden Hazard listed as a differential selection for a Fantasy Premier League gameweek…
Welcome back to another Shrewd Moves and Differentials article, where we look to select 4 tasty options for the upcoming Gameweek 36 fixtures, whilst also taking in to consideration the DOUBLE Gameweek 37 which soon follows.
As always, I hope that my weekly selections continue to offer you food for thought and help give you the edge over your mini-league opponents.
Heurelho Gomes – Watford
Price/Ownership: £5.0m / 11.0%
Next 3 Gameweek Fixtures: Aston Villa (H), Liverpool (A) & Norwich (A), Sunderland (H)
Last 3 Gameweek points: 2, 4 & 19, 2
Early in the season, Watford showed that they are capable of keeping clean sheets. Their second half of the season has brought more struggles and Watford have not performed to their full potential in my opinion. So, why am I suggesting a Watford goalkeeper?
Well, Watford have arguably the best fixtures (on paper) for the last 3 gameweeks of any team in the league. Sunderland and Norwich will surely play out of their skins in the quest to avoid relegation, but I can see Watford keeping a couple of clean sheets and coming out on top in their remaining fixtures
Gomes is a great keeper who can win games for his team on saves alone. I think he's the best 3-week punt in the goalkeeper position for the rest of the season and is my number 1 goalkeeper selection for Gameweek 36.
Patrick van Aanholt – Sunderland
Price/Ownership: £4.7m / 3.0%
Next 3 Gameweek Fixtures: Stoke (A), Chelsea (H) & Everton (H), Watford (A)
Last 3 Gameweek points: 1, 6, 6
PVA is Sunderland's most attack-minded defender. He offers the best chance of attacking returns among Sunderland defenders, with the additional bonus of clean sheet potential. Coming off 3 clean sheets in their last 4 games, Allardyce's men have tightened up the back-line, which resulted in a clean sheet against Arsenal last week!
It's surprising that PVA is a differential pick because he's returned points consistently all season, including a goal in 4 consecutive games from GW20-GW23. PVA is also on Sunderland's free kicks from the right side of the field, which is always an added bonus for FPL managers.
PVA is an absolute steal at £4.7m and you are buying into a defence that needs to keep clean sheets if they want to avoid relegation this season.
Andy Carroll – West Ham
Price/Ownership: £6.4m / 3.1%
Next 3 Gameweek Fixtures: West Brom (A), Swansea (H) & Man United (H), Stoke (A)
Last 3 Gameweek points: 1, 16 & 7, 8
In arguably the best goal-scoring form of his career, Andy Carroll would be a shrewd differential choice for your forward line. I always like to pick players from teams who still have something to play for at the end of the season – West Ham sit in 6th, only 3 points behind both Manchester United and that coveted Europa League spot.
Carroll is currently with 5 goals in his last 3 games and is the secondary penalty taker when Mark Noble isn't on the field. The only downside to Carroll is that he hasn't seen consistent minutes, even after scoring a hat-trick, but I feel that Bilic considers Carroll his best current option up front.
West Ham also have some decent fixtures to come, playing Swansea in GW37 and Stoke in GW38. Bring this man into your team and I think he'll head you up the rankings and be an excellent differential and even a possible TRIPLE CAPTAIN candidate for Gameweek 37, for those who still have this chip available.
Eden Hazard – Chelsea
Price/Ownership: £10.8m / 11.4%
Next 3 Fixtures: Spurs (H), Sunderland (A) & Liverpool (A), Leicester (H)
Last 3 Gameweek points: 0, 0, 15
Did you ever think that Eden Hazard would find his way in to a differential's article? No, me neither.. Hazard would be one of the biggest punts you've made this season, but, there is huge potential if Hazard performs like he did in his last Premier League fixture vs. Bournemouth. Perhaps 2 goals is just what he needed to boost his confidence and get back into goal-scoring form.
Chelsea do have a tough end to the season in my opinion, so you'd be relying on his very recent form only with this pick. At £10.8m, Hazard is quite an expensive pick for a player with some uncertainty, but, if your season is over and you just want to try to make up as much ground as you can without worrying about the risk, then Hazard is the man for you.

Just a week ago, World Series of Fighting announced it is merging two events to create a super card at The Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Now, WSOF is set to announce the addition of a fourth title fight to that historic card, a middleweight bout between champion David Branch (19-3) and Louis Taylor (13-1). Branch, who is also the light heavyweight champion, is a Brooklyn native and will open the NBC Sports Network portion of the card at 3 p.m. ET as the first televised fight of the event.
Part of the reasoning behind this move was the length required for championship bouts, which are five round affairs. There could be some swing fights waiting to fill gaps if there are quick finishes in the title fights.
WSOF has also found an opponent for bantamweight champion Marlon Moraes (16-4), who will defend his belt against Josenaldo Silva (25-4) to open the main card.​ Silva has spent his last four fights split between Jungle Fights and Mr. Cage.
"I think we decided Marlon needed a new challenge and we needed a few fresh faces in the weight division. Josenaldo with his record really stood out. After watching a lot of tape and talking to his management, we decided to give him the shot," WSOF CEO Carlos Silva told Sports Illustrated.
​The other two previously announced title fights and the bantamweight title fight between Moraes and Silva are slated to fill out the main card, airing on NBC at 4 p.m. ET. Lightweight champion Justin Gaethje defends his belt against Joao Zeferino in the main event. Welterweight champion Jon Fitch (28-7) defends his belt against Jake Shields (31-8) in the co-main event. Bantamweight champion Marlon Moraes defends his belt against Josenaldo Silva (25-4) to open the main card.
Also booked for the event is UFC veteran Jared Rosholt (14-3), who will make his WSOF debut against Caio Alencar (9-1).​ Former heavyweight champion Smealinho Rama (9-2) makes his debut at light heavyweight against Jake Heun (9-4). Yushin Okami (32-10) fights Paul Bradley (23-6) in a welterweight bout and former U.S. Marine Corps veterans Shane Kruchten (11-4) will fight Jeremy Mahon (5-4) in a 150-pound "Who's The Toughest" catchweight bout.
"I think pretty much every fight is going to be exciting, and it will defintely be our best night, no doubt about it,"​ Silva said.
WSOF won't slow down pushing into 2017, with an event following on Jan. 20 and revealed that the card is coming together. Given the title belt loaded New York City card, this card will be an event loaded with top contenders.
The full fight card as it stands is as follows:
Main Card (NBC, 4 p.m. ET)
Lightweight Title Fight: Justin Gaethje (16-0) v. Joao Zeferino (20-8)
Welterweight Title Fight: Jon Fitch (28-7) v. Jake Shields (31-8)
Bantamweight Title Fight: Marlon Moraes (16-4) v. Josenaldo Silva (25-4)
Prelim (NBC Sports Network, 3 p.m. ET)
Middleweight Title Fight: David Branch (19-3) v. Louis Taylor (13-1)​
Smealinho “The Prince” Rama (9-2) v. Jake “The Honey Bear” Heun (9-4)
Yushin “Thunder” Okami (32-10) v. Paul Bradley (23-6)
Shane Kruchten (11-4) v. Jeremy Mahon (5-4)
Jared Rosholt (14-3) v. Caio Alencar (9-1)
Presenting its annual economic report in Berlin on Wednesday, the German Council of Economic Experts said the grand coalition government had largely failed to capitalize on the country's positive growth climate and labor market boost.
The panel of advisers, formerly called "Five Wise Men" but now comprised of four men and one woman, said Chancellor Angela Merkel's government should have launched a reform offensive with a view to preparing for future challenges, adding that the few measures it had taken might even harm the free market economy in the final analysis.
The advisers specifically mentioned the introduction of a minimum wage across all sectors and some cautious changes to the pension system.
They emphasized that in their view it was crucial to do away with all "hidden" and unjust tax hikes and revisit the retirement age issue against the background of people living a lot longer now.
For her part, Merkel rejected the panel's criticism.
"For us, it is always time for reforms," Merkel said. "I believe the federal government feels and thinks that it is permanently introducing reforms."
ECB policies in the firing line
The German Council of Economic Experts also called on the Central European Bank (ECB) to scrap or at least reduce its huge bond-buying program. The panel acknowledged that the lender's ultra-loose monetary policy had initially helped to crank up the eurozone economy.
"But the current scope of that program is no longer justified," the experts concluded, given the steady recovery in many of the euro area's 19 member states.
Most, but not all panel members spoke out against any measures to further regulate China's investment offensive. They said they were aware that there was no level playing field for German investors in China, but argued that even a one-way openness toward direct foreign investment could pay off in terms of more productivity and higher wages. Most panel members did not share wide-spread fears in society that in buying up German companies, Chinese investors were only after those companies' technological know-how and intellectual property.

Perdue: USDA Halting Import of Fresh Brazilian Beef
(Washington, DC, June 22, 2017) – U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue today announced the suspension of all imports of fresh beef from Brazil because of recurring concerns about the safety of the products intended for the American market. The suspension of shipments will remain in place until the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture takes corrective action which the USDA finds satisfactory.
Since March, USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has been inspecting 100 percent of all meat products arriving in the United States from Brazil. FSIS has refused entry to 11 percent of Brazilian fresh beef products. That figure is substantially higher than the rejection rate of one percent of shipments from the rest of the world. Since implementation of the increased inspection, FSIS has refused entry to 106 lots (approximately 1.9 million pounds) of Brazilian beef products due to public health concerns, sanitary conditions, and animal health issues. It is important to note that none of the rejected lots made it into the U.S. market.
The Brazilian government had pledged to address those concerns, including by self-suspending five facilities from shipping beef to the United States. Today's action to suspend all fresh beef shipments from Brazil supersedes the self-suspension.
Secretary Perdue issued the following statement:
“Ensuring the safety of our nation's food supply is one of our critical missions, and it's one we undertake with great seriousness. Although international trade is an important part of what we do at USDA, and Brazil has long been one of our partners, my first priority is to protect American consumers. That's what we've done by halting the import of Brazilian fresh beef. I commend the work of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service for painstakingly safeguarding the food we serve our families.”

Searching for a high-quality cocktail bar with live music that you'd otherwise have to travel into Philly to find? Your pursuit will end here with the grand opening of Sprout Music Collective, a new music venue and bar located on 130 E. Prescott Alley right here in West Chester. Owner Dan Cellucci states, “We go heavy with our own fusions, bitters, and heavy cocktails that you definitely won't find in West Chester besides our place. You kind of have to travel into Philly to find a bar doing the same type of cocktails we're doing.”
Sprout is also a sister to the popular Roots Café (located at 133 E Gay St.), an establishment also owned by Cellucci that serves local, organic, and sustainable food to their guests. However, “Sprout” is aiming to put more emphasis on the live music aspect compared to “Roots,” which is more of a formal food business establishment. “[“Sprout”] is definitely geared towards music,” Cellucci explains. “It's basically a 150-person max capacity room that's pretty intimate and small. The stage is quite large, and then there's a nice little dance floor. Everything is kind of geared as having the stage as a focal point.”
Formerly there was The Note, which most who live in West Chester will remember has since closed down. While “Sprout” is somewhat reminiscent of that bar and venue, Cellucci claims that Sprout is more in line with Philadelphia's The Tin Angel or Boot & Saddle. He reiterates, “It's basically a 150-person max capacity room.”
Guests shouldn't be worried about fitting a certain demographic either since the age range can fluctuate drastically depending on the night. Cellucci points out, “We just get such a wide variety depending on the music we're doing. Some nights we'll do jazz, and then on that night, it will be anyone aged 40 and up. Then some nights we'll do a reggae band, that was our opening night actually, and everyone's age varied from 22 to 60.” This past Halloween, “Sprout” threw a party featuring the psychedelic, gypsy folk group The Late Saints, a group Cellucci stated was sure to “draw in a younger crowd.”
If good food is a prerequisite, you needn't worry. “Sprout” is devoted to keeping in line with their sister restaurant, “Roots'” philosophy by offering top quality, seasonal, organic ingredients that are bought directly from local farms, all of course using sustainable methods and subsequently tying into the community and supporting the local economy. “It's not your standard chicken fingers and fries,” says Cellucci. “I'd refer to it as seasonal-farmed table bar snacks. You have sandwiched's, snacks and popcorn, but we also have things like meatballs and venison which we get from local hunters, although it's certainly still a bar menu.” In addition to those savory edibles, “Sprout” food menu offers mouthwatering appetizers such as Hickory Smoked Duck Breast Flatbread , Slow Roasted Brisket, A Pickled Veggie Board, a board of assorted cheeses, and much more.
For drinks, there's a rotating selection of quality beers and fine wines. And to an even greater extent, “Sprout” strongly focuses on the inventiveness and near artistry of their cocktail selection. Such beverages include: “A Root Down,” an orange-infused dark rum sweetened with molasses and spiced with house warm liquor. There is also “Birds & Bees,” a berry-infused purus vodka with added honey and hempseed bitters. “Up In Smoke,” contains Jim Beam Black Bourbon coupled with Laphroaig Scotch sweetened with added maple. Needless to say, they've got a wide menu selection for guests who are undecided on what drink to order.
“Sprout” is also associated with West Chester University's music department and is actively looking for musicians to play their weekly jazz and prohibition, cocktail themed night. Cellucci admits, “We are looking to book professionals,, people who take it as a job. If it's not their first job then it's definitely up there on their priority list and they're professional musicians.” He adds, “What we're doing is actually trying to steer away from cover bands. Whereas the town usually wants them,. ‘Sprout' is the opposite end of that.”
Sprout Music Collective links live music entertainment, and culinary arts. If you're in town, stop by for some easygoing tunes and top of the line, quality sourced food. The next couple of nights' line-up of events will spotlight “Old Arrows, Mike Cummings, Tyler McClure” (Nov. 5th) , “The Jost Project” (Nov. 6th), “Lovebettie” (Nov. 7th), and “Whiskeyhicken Boys” (Nov. 8th).

A granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles, from 0.063 to 2 mm diameter
Sand is a granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles. It is defined by size, being finer than gravel and coarser than silt. Sand can also refer to a textural class of soil or soil type; i.e., a soil containing more than 85 percent sand-sized particles by mass.[1]
The composition of sand varies, depending on the local rock sources and conditions, but the most common constituent of sand in inland continental settings and non-tropical coastal settings is silica (silicon dioxide, or SiO 2 ), usually in the form of quartz. The second most common type of sand is calcium carbonate, for example, aragonite, which has mostly been created, over the past half billion years, by various forms of life, like coral and shellfish. For example, it is the primary form of sand apparent in areas where reefs have dominated the ecosystem for millions of years like the Caribbean.
Sand is a non-renewable resource over human timescales, and sand suitable for making concrete is in high demand.[2]
Composition
Heavy minerals (dark) in a quartz beach sand ( Chennai , India).
The exact definition of sand varies. The scientific Unified Soil Classification System used in engineering and geology corresponds to US Standard Sieves,[3] and defines sand as particles with a diameter of between 0.074 and 4.75 millimeters. By another definition, in terms of particle size as used by geologists, sand particles range in diameter from 0.0625 mm (or ​1⁄ 16 mm) to 2 mm. An individual particle in this range size is termed a sand grain. Sand grains are between gravel (with particles ranging from 2 mm up to 64 mm by the latter system, and from 4.75 mm up to 75 mm in the former) and silt (particles smaller than 0.0625 mm down to 0.004 mm). The size specification between sand and gravel has remained constant for more than a century, but particle diameters as small as 0.02 mm were considered sand under the Albert Atterberg standard in use during the early 20th century. The grains of sand in Archimedes Sand Reckoner written around 240 BCE, were 0.02 mm in diameter. A 1953 engineering standard published by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials set the minimum sand size at 0.074 mm. A 1938 specification of the United States Department of Agriculture was 0.05 mm.[4] Sand feels gritty when rubbed between the fingers. Silt, by comparison, feels like flour).
ISO 14688 grades sands as fine, medium, and coarse with ranges 0.063 mm to 0.2 mm to 0.63 mm to 2.0 mm. In the United States, sand is commonly divided into five sub-categories based on size: very fine sand (​1⁄ 16 – ​1⁄ 8 mm diameter), fine sand (​1⁄ 8 mm – ​1⁄ 4 mm), medium sand (​1⁄ 4 mm – ​1⁄ 2 mm), coarse sand (​1⁄ 2 mm – 1 mm), and very coarse sand (1 mm – 2 mm). These sizes are based on the Krumbein phi scale, where size in Φ = -log 2 D; D being the particle size in mm. On this scale, for sand the value of Φ varies from −1 to +4, with the divisions between sub-categories at whole numbers.

The most common constituent of sand, in inland continental settings and non-tropical coastal settings, is silica (silicon dioxide, or SiO 2 ), usually in the form of quartz, which, because of its chemical inertness and considerable hardness, is the most common mineral resistant to weathering.
The composition of mineral sand is highly variable, depending on the local rock sources and conditions. The bright white sands found in tropical and subtropical coastal settings are eroded limestone and may contain coral and shell fragments in addition to other organic or organically derived fragmental material, suggesting sand formation depends on living organisms, too.[5] The gypsum sand dunes of the White Sands National Monument in New Mexico are famous for their bright, white color. Arkose is a sand or sandstone with considerable feldspar content, derived from weathering and erosion of a (usually nearby) granitic rock outcrop. Some sands contain magnetite, chlorite, glauconite or gypsum. Sands rich in magnetite are dark to black in color, as are sands derived from volcanic basalts and obsidian. Chlorite-glauconite bearing sands are typically green in color, as are sands derived from basaltic lava with a high olivine content. Many sands, especially those found extensively in Southern Europe, have iron impurities within the quartz crystals of the sand, giving a deep yellow color. Sand deposits in some areas contain garnets and other resistant minerals, including some small gemstones.
Study
Pitted sand grains from the Western Desert, Egypt. Pitting is a consequence of wind transportation.
The study of individual grains can reveal much historical information as to the origin and kind of transport of the grain.[6] Quartz sand that is recently weathered from granite or gneiss quartz crystals will be angular. It is called grus in geology or sharp sand in the building trade where it is preferred for concrete, and in gardening where it is used as a soil amendment to loosen clay soils. Sand that is transported long distances by water or wind will be rounded, with characteristic abrasion patterns on the grain surface. Desert sand is typically rounded.
People who collect sand as a hobby are known as arenophiles. Organisms that thrive in sandy environments are psammophiles.[7]
Uses

Resources and environmental concerns
Only some sands are suitable for the construction industry, for example for making concrete. Because of the growth of population and of cities and the consequent construction activity there is a huge demand for these special kinds of sand, and natural sources are running low. In 2012 French director Denis Delestrac made a documentary called "Sand Wars" about the impact of the lack of construction sand. It shows the ecological and economic effects of both legal and illegal trade in construction sand.[10][11][12]
To retrieve the sand, the method of hydraulic dredging is used. This works by pumping the top few meters of sand out of the water and filling it into a boat, which is then transported back to land for processing. Unfortunately, all marine life mixed in with the extracted sand is killed and the ecosystem can continue to suffer for years after the mining is complete. Not only does this affect marine life, but also the local fishing industries because of the loss of life, and communities living close to the water's edge. When sand is taken out of the water it increases the risk of landslides, which can lead to loss of agricultural land and/or damage to dwellings.[13]
Sand's many uses require a significant dredging industry, raising environmental concerns over fish depletion, landslides, and flooding.[14] Countries such as China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Cambodia ban sand exports, citing these issues as a major factor.[15] It is estimated that the annual consumption of sand and gravel is 40 billion tons and sand is a US$70 billion global industry.[16]
The global demand for sand in 2017 was 9.55 billion tons as part of a $99.5 billion industry.[17]
Hazards
While sand is generally non-toxic, sand-using activities such as sandblasting require precautions. Bags of silica sand used for sandblasting now carry labels warning the user to wear respiratory protection to avoid breathing the resulting fine silica dust. Safety data sheets for silica sand state that "excessive inhalation of crystalline silica is a serious health concern".[18]
In areas of high pore water pressure, sand and salt water can form quicksand, which is a colloid hydrogel that behaves like a liquid. Quicksand produces a considerable barrier to escape for creatures caught within, who often die from exposure (not from submersion) as a result.
Manufactured sand
Manufactured sand (M sand) is sand made from rock by artificial processes, usually for construction purposes in cement or concrete. It differs from river sand by being more angular, and has somewhat different properties.[19]

Speaking to a room of scientists on Wednesday, California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) vowed to protect the state's progress in the fight against global warming and challenge any attempt by Donald Trump to interfere with climate science.
“We've got the scientists, we've got the lawyers, and we're ready to fight,” Brown said at the American Geophysical Union Conference in San Francisco. “We're ready to defend. California is no stranger to this fight.”
“Whatever Washington thinks they are doing, California is the future,” said Brown. Pointing to California's record of leading the way on vehicle emissions restrictions and renewable energy, he suggested the state might even launch its own space program if Trump follows through with his advisers' efforts to end NASA's role in climate science.
“If Trump turns off the satellites, California will launch its own damn satellite,” Brown said to loud applause. “We're going to collect that data.”
The fiery remarks come amid growing concern over Trump's cabinet appointees, many of whom are prominent climate skeptics. Just hours before Brown's speech, a Trump spokesman disavowed an alarming survey that his transition team sent last week to the Department of Energy requesting the names of any scientists and federal employees who previously attended UN climate conferences and worked on other climate-related issues. The department refused, but the questionnaire sparked fear that the incoming administration might try to retaliate against civil servants who didn't agree with Trump's climate views.
Brown has been fiercely critical of Trump's stance on the issue, calling the president-elect a “fraud” at the Democratic National Convention for his continued denial of global warming.
When British voters go to the polls Thursday to decide whether or not to withdraw from the European Union they may also be determining the fate of their country's climate legacy and its burgeoning green technology industry.
That's because if the United Kingdom exits the European Union following next week's referendum it will go from being a dominant voice and second-largest economy in the 28-nation compact to being an outsider. As such, it will have to negotiate with Brussels for access to the European Union's consumer and energy markets—a situation that opponents say will give the United Kingdom less power over its own destiny than it currently has.
"As Obama told them very clearly, you're going to be a midsized economy in the middle of the Atlantic, and you're not going to have the leverage you had as the 28 when you're a one," said Michelle Egan of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. "And I don't think they realize that the other 27 have no reason to be nice in the negotiation."
Mainstream think tanks in London and Washington, D.C., are largely in favor of the United Kingdom remaining part of the compact, but they acknowledge that the numbers don't look good. The center-right London Evening Standard released polls this week giving a small but persistent edge to the "leavers" camp.
Yesterday a young Labor Party member of Parliament was assassinated—the first such assassination in more than 25 years—by a man yelling "Britain first" or "put Britain first," a possible reference to Brexit. Member of Parliament Jo Cox supported Britain remaining in the European Union. Campaign efforts on both sides were suspended after the incident.
It remains unclear what impact Cox's killing will have on the referendum, but analysts note that even if the polling bears out, the United Kingdom won't immediately sever ties with the European Union. Rather, it would require British Prime Minister David Cameron's coalition government—if it survives after the referendum—to start the process of leaving the European Union, which will require years of domestic policy adjustments and negotiations with Brussels. Britain's sway over the compact would be immediately diminished, "remainers" warn.
"If we do exit, I think that the other states could play hardball," Egan said.
What Brexit means for the Paris Agreement
The effect on Britain's domestic climate laws and implementation of the Paris climate deal would be mixed, observers say.
On the one hand, the country's 2008 climate law mandating an 80 percent cut in emissions by 2050 would stay in place unless and until Parliament voted to repeal it, which doesn't seem likely now. And the mandated two-year lag before Britain withdrew from the European Union—a timeframe that could be extended—means that Britain would likely become party to last year's landmark U.N. deal in much the same way as if it had not voted to exit. That is, Westminster would have to approve the Paris deal and then the European Union would give it the final nod when all E.U. governments have completed their processes.
The compact has made a collective commitment toward Paris to cut emissions 40 percent compared with 1990 levels by 2030. Britain would be likely to live up to its share of that commitment even if it left, and those reductions would be severed mathematically from what the rest of the union would be expected to deliver.
But Britain's exit would remove one of the strongest E.U. proponents of ambitious climate action as the process moves forward, and as players consider new targets aimed at limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Britain is scheduled to take over the E.U. presidency in 2017, right before parties are scheduled to take stock of their Paris commitments and ready new pledges.
If it "brexits," the United Kingdom would likely chart its own course within the U.N. climate process, seeing its influence shrink overall while pro-coal Poland gained clout within the group of nations in opposition to more climate-ambitious Germany and France, analysts said.
"So in terms of shifting the balance of power in Europe toward less ambition on climate, it would be quite a big deal for European power in the world," said Nick Mabey, CEO at the U.K.-based Third Generation Environmentalism.
Sir David King, Britain's special representative for climate change, noted in a recent interview with ClimateWire that his country had done much to maintain Europe's climate ambition, which in turn paved the way for the Paris deal by helping maintain the world's trust in global climate action.
"Britain has been very influential in taking Europe along that process, and it has been, I think, the greatest force for change on climate change in the world," said King. "The question of what happens if we leave is unresolved because at the moment the vote is simply a yes or no vote. It would take years to negotiate the new British position."
New trade rules also likely
A post-Brexit Britain would also negotiate for access to the European energy market from a position of weakness, Mabey said.
It needs more interconnection with Europe than it currently has to balance variability and share reserves and has battled long to achieve that access. But the European Commission would be unlikely to grant its former member many concessions if Britain withdraws.
Observers generally note that non-E.U. countries like Norway are strongly connected to the continent's grid but that they must abide by E.U. power sector regulations over which they have no influence.
"Yes, it's possible that kind of agreement can be reached, but then what would Britain have gained from all this?" said Richard Morningstar, a scholar with the Washington-based Atlantic Council. "Why are they going through all of these hoops if they're just going to have to conform without any say to European laws and regulations?"
Britain needs interconnection in part because its green energy sector has grown so swiftly in recent years. Low-carbon environmental goods and services accounted for £128 billion ($182.8 million) in sales between 2011 and 2012 and 937,537 jobs, according to a report by the United Kingdom's Department for Business Innovation and Skills. The numbers are estimated to have risen since then.
Under E.U. law and with the help from the European Investment Bank it is poised to reach its 2020 target of between 32 and 35 percent renewables by 2020—up from 7 percent in 2010. But intermittent renewable power requires backup, and uncertainty about access to the continental power market could discourage investment.
Even before the vote, foreign investment has slowed, homebuilding is down, and London-based financial firms are eyeing new homes. Currency traders are fleeing the pound. Observers note that if the vote triggers a prolonged recession, that could have an impact on U.K. energy and climate policy as well as its aid budget, which per capita is one of the largest in the world.
The Brexit would also trigger new trade rules—and probably trade barriers—with countries that remain in the European Union, and likely with third parties as well. And Washington-based Brexit opponents say those deals could be a rude awakening for Brits who expect to retain access to the European Union's single market.
By withdrawing from the group of countries, Britain may be seen to encourage anti-E.U. advocates in other countries as well, threatening further disintegration of the compact, said Sebastian Mallaby of the Council on Foreign Relations. None of this would make the European Union inclined to grant Britain special trade privileges.
"If Britain thinks it can easily negotiate a deal with the rest of Europe on the terms of its departure, it's got another think coming," he said.
Brexit leaders, supporters lean skeptic
Brexit backers tend to be conservative and thus more likely to oppose strong climate and renewable energy policies. A poll released last week by polling firm ComRes showed that Brexit supporters were nearly twice as likely as the average Brit to doubt that warming is man-made.
The leader of the movement, former London Mayor Boris Johnson, has a mixed history of statements on climate change. Johnson, who could hold political sway in a post-Brexit Britain, visited Paris during last year's talks to say it was "vitally important" that countries reach an agreement. But days later he published an op-ed in The Telegraph newspaper quoting climate skeptic and meteorologist Piers Corbyn to say London's December heatwave had nothing to do with climate change.
Johnson's conclusion: "We ordinary human beings are not so rational; we are no different from all earlier cultures in that we have to put ourselves in the story, and to attribute this or that individual weather event to our own behaviour or moral failures."
While he called it "fantastic" that Paris had ended in an agreement, he attributed the summit's success to the mild weather.
"I am sure that those global leaders were driven by a primitive fear that the present ambient warm weather is somehow caused by humanity; and that fear—as far as I understand the science—is equally without foundation," he said.
But Brexit opponents—including in the environmental movement—say leaving the European Union would be a worrying analogue to the cooperative spirit of Paris.
"It would be a massive distraction for the next couple of years, not only in the U.K. but more broadly," said Andrew Steer, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute, who is British. "It will encourage a sort of inward-lookingness at a time when we need an outward-lookingness. Ideas need to be shared across country borders, technologies need to be shared, ambitions need to be shared as well.
"So we need a race to the top, not a sort of closing down," he said.

Mexico has seen a massive influx of immigrants this year, particularly from Africa and Asia. The situation has gotten so dire that the Mexican government has been forced to set up temporary shelters as they scramble to expedite deportations. Many of the immigrants, Mexican officials say, are ultimately bound for the United States.
Speaking with El Universal on Thursday, Mexican Foreign Ministry undersecretary Socorro Flores expressed deep "concern" about the surge in immigrants, "many" of whom he said will be deported.
"Many of them will have to return to their home countries," he said, adding the "there is a concern because the flows have increased and there is also a concern because they need to cross many countries to get to their intended destinations."
The Daily Caller highlights the emergency actions taken by the government in response to the unexpected surge of immigrants, including "setting up shelters and working with the countries of origin of the immigrants on deportations," and provides some context to the situation:
Central America has recently been dealing with an influx of immigrants from abroad. It was recently reported that Guatemala has caught 56 times more African immigrants in 2016 than they did in all of 2015. These immigrants frequently have the goal of heading to the United States and seeking asylum.
While Mexico struggles to handle an unprecedented influx of migrants, many of whom are heading to the U.S., the Obama administration has dramatically slowed deportations.
"The number of undocumented immigrants deported by President Obama is falling and could hit a 10-year low in 2016 just as the issue heats up in this year's presidential race," reported The Hill last month. "Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) figures from June suggest 230,000 people could be removed or returned from the country by the end of the fiscal year next month, slightly fewer than the 235,413 deported in 2015. That was the lowest number since 2006."
Last year, Marvel Television kicked off the broadcast of its newly founded partnership with Netflix in the form of Daredevil, a “PG-16” take on the famed blind superhero of Marvel lore. Unlike its Ben Affleck-starring big screen counter-part, the show received massive acclaim from both critics and fans alike. In fact, the reception was so good that Netflix opted to order a second season of the series, something that wasn't expected to take place until it had run through all 60 episodes of its initial deal with Marvel that stated viewers would see Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist lead into The Defenders mini-series before anything move forward. Unexpected or not, that second season is now here (with a new set of showrunners), and for the most part, it's the same – very enjoyable – series it was before.
It's been a few months since lawyer Matt Murdock took on the mantel of Daredevil full time in Hell's Kitchen. Since then, the vigilante has worked tirelessly to drive organized crime out of New York City. However, some view his methods as a temporary solution to a permanent problem. To deal with that, one individual – a mystery man – decides to do what the devil of Hell's Kitchen won't… which leads to a new set of problems Matt must solve. Unfortunately, he must solve them while also dealing with the re-appearance of someone he left behind a decade earlier.
One of the larger changes that's taken place in season two of Daredevil is the series' ability to coherently carry multiple arcs at a time. Last year was almost exclusively focused on the vigilante's origin story and how it related to his war with Wilson Fisk. This year, the show bounces between's Matt's dealings with Frank Castle, his relationship with Elektra and the rest of the law firm's day-to-day business while Matt's off fighting crime. This year, Daredevil is becoming more of an ensemble than it was before, which a very nice change of pace.
Adding on to that, the series has seen a substantial improvement in its cinematography this year. Yes, season one featured some truly terrific sequences that were beautifully choreographed and directed. But the dark lighting became a running gag among viewers for a reason. It wasn't always distracting, but it was certainly noticeable. This year, while still dark, the show has veered away from thick blacks. This time, many of the fights take place under dense hues of yellow and blue light, which makes everything more visible and thus (as far as hand-to-hand combat goes), more enjoyable.
While the improvements are great, though, the big question everyone has going into the new season is, “how good is Jon Bernthal as the famed Punisher?” Luckily, that question is a very simple one to answer: he's great. This is the Punisher fans know. This is the Punisher fans want. This is the Punisher the MCU needs. While Thomas Jane, Ray Stevenson and even Dolph Lundgren put their own spin on the character in years past, Bernthal's is the one that's most true to the image that made Frank Castle a key player. He's unrelenting. He's brutal. He's terrifying. He's a killer. This is the Punisher everyone has been waiting for. This is the Punisher everyone wants, plain and simple.
Concerning the business of it all, Daredevil season two is leaving a lot to ponder about the scheduling of future Marvel TV series. Assuming the company is sticking with the plan of debuting two shows a year on the streaming service – with Luke Cage being the other series set for 2016, which will supposedly premiere in the fall like Jessica Jones – one must wonder what is to become of the 2017 slate. Will we see the ordered second season of Jones, or will Iron Fist and The Defenders finally get to shine? Or, are we going to see that rumored Punisher spin-off take shape after all? There's a lot to ponder, and no evidence to make a clear call one way or the other. But, whatever happens – especially with the reveal of Marvel's competitor planning a Flash/Supergirl crossover in March – a bigger thing to ponder is whether we'll ever finally get to see the worlds of ABC and Netflix come together. Who wouldn't want to see Coulson have a pow-wow with the devil, after all?
Daredevil season two is very much the same excellent show Daredevil season one was… but in the places it isn't, it's also very much improved. In no way has the unexpected rapid production of a second season turned Daredevil into a lesser series. The new cast additions are as wild as one may have hoped, and the new showrunners haven't missed a step. Everything is as it should be, and there's nothing to complain about with that.
Daredevil season 2 premieres Friday, March 18th on Netflix

Last week I had an in-depth interview with one of the most influential voices of the #gamergate movement, Lizzyf620. She initially made her mark by sharing and offering her opinions on #gamergate news through her Twitter account, which currently has 11.8k followers at the time of this writing. Lizzyf620 is in a unique position to sway neutrals to understand what #gamergate really is because she doesn't fit the media description of a typical #gamergater. The media can't simply slap a “misogynist” tag on her and call it a day.
Lizzyf620 isn't known for her twitter updates alone. She has written many articles regarding gamergate. Topics such as censorship, diversity, and feminism are covered in her blog. Her latest article on Buzzfeed #Gamergate Through My Eyes was marred by censorship controversy when the article was mysteriously deleted after a “technical glitch.” However, Buzzfeed quickly put the article back online after huge backlash from #gamergate supporters.
The Buzzfeed article itself was one of the best articles introducing gamergate to a new audience. Lizzyf620 precisely explained how the movement came to be leading up to the present day, debunking the mainstream media narrative of gamergate as an anti-women movement. After reading the Buzzfeed article, I decided to contact Lizzyf620 for an interview.
Can you introduce yourself to the readers at reaxxion.com, Who is Lizzyf620? What are you aspiring for as far as a career?
My name is Elizabeth Fogarty. I received a Bachelor's in Paralegal Studies, and am I working on expanding my degree within the field. I am also a freelance photographer. I haven't yet decided which I will pursue more.
What is Lizzyf620 like in person? What are some of your interests and hobbies outside of video games?
Books are my greatest weakness. I treat books like movies – I hate starting and stopping. Just wish there were more hours in the day! I'm also an avid fan of football and hockey. My favorite teams are 49ers/Bengals/Eagles, Maple Leafs/Flyers/Devils (the Devils are entirely because I am a Jagr fan, and by default like any team he's with.)
How did you first get into video games? What are some of your favorite games?
My older brother was the first to introduce me to games, when I was about 3. I fell for the trick of the “Ghost Controller” for longer than I'd care to admit. I am what you would call a “console peasant,” although I do dabble online. I became more involved in the community aspect when I was 14, and began first showing symptoms of Lupus. I was homeschooled, and had very little social interaction outside of my home. I was deeply depressed, and felt so alone. Gaming communities, in a way, saved my life.
I love Final Fantasy, MGS, Bayonetta, Halo…..but I left my heart in Hyrule. I am definitely a LOZ girl.
As a female gamer, do you feel that you get treated differently by other gamers?
The times I've been treated differently, it was people treating me BETTER honestly. I can think of very, very few instances where I ran into an asshole being an asshole for no reason to me, and even then there were plenty of people who told them to back off (not that I need the help ;))
What motivate you to be an active contributor to the #gamergate movement?
Like many others, the censorship of discussion was a primary draw for me. I largely took the position of an observer until it became clear that both forums on these sites, and 3rd party (4chan, reddit) were censoring discussion of the ethics issues, and deleting posts related to potential ethical breaches. Censorship is something that affects everyone, whether the topic interests you personally or not, and should not be tolerated under any circumstances.
Why do you think most of the mainstream media chose to portray #gamergate in a negative light? For example, Wikipedia claims that #gamergate is nothing but a misogynist movement.
In my personal opinion, this is the result the combination of 1) a sort of “professional courtesy” with media outlets, 2) laziness in reporting on a culture they typically do not cover, and are largely unfamiliar with, and 3) the attempt to expand the narrative of a “war on women”
Why do you think so many people buy into the media narrative that #gamergate is all about misogynist harassment?
Because, as far as the majority of people go, many still believe and trust the news they receive. They believe that, because it is the responsibility of the media to bring them factual accounts, that this is actually happening. As we have seen, this is not the case.
What do you think of Zoe Quinn? What do you think her motivations are?
I can't speak to Ms. Quinn's motivations, as it would be unfounded conjecture. My personal opinion of her is that she was, and likely still is, an abuser (details from The Zoe Post, which she has not disputed, despite being given a very large megaphone to speak her piece). I personally disliked her game, as there was not any strategy or actual gameplay involved, but that is just me.
What is your opinion of the Feminist Frequency web series?
I think the series is designed, intentionally, to appeal to non-gamers. A large amount of the material is misinterpretation, removal of contradictory facts, and cherry-picking, which is easily identified by people who have played the games covered. FF was fairly unsuccessful when originally covering other types of pop culture. The extremism of modern feminism has blossomed, which has called for a blossoming in extremist feminist views.
As a business, they are extremely successful, that is without question. However, they are selling IDEAS. It is troubling that a business specializing in criticism has completely cut themselves off from being open to criticism in return—disabling comments, autoblockers on Twitter, etc. I would be more inclined to pay them attention if they were willing to open themselves up to any sort of debate. Also, it is important to note, criticism of someone's point is not a personal attack on the person, yet that is how all criticism of FF is being taken.
Why do you think Feminist Frequency and Anita Sarkeesian has so much influence on the gaming industry? Shouldn't sane people see one video from the series and say “that's bullshit”?
You would think so! I definitely feel it is a sort of intimidation through influence. No one wants to be branded with the label of misogynist. And even if it is insane and untrue, it's still an awful thing to be called. I believe there is a large amount of pandering to Feminist Frequency in order to spare such a label.
You mentioned that you are a long time critic of feminism, why is that the case? Shouldn't all women be supportive of feminism?
Before I go too deeply into it, Id like to clarify that I am a supporter of Women's Rights Activists, and many Men's Rights Activists, but not the movement of feminism. And there is a difference. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Women's Rights Activist, recently slammed feminism for focusing on “trivial bullshit.”
The biggest mistake people make is assuming feminism is synonymous with “women.” 3rd wave feminism, as a movement in developed countries, is split, indecisive, and unclear on actual goals. And in comparison to struggles faced by women and girls, and men and boys, in less fortunate countries, it is almost an embarrassment to see what they are complaining about. In America, I personally feel the largest contributor to inequality is class. Focusing on a single factor and acting as if it will solve all issues is spectacularly naive.
What do you think of Intel's $300 million “diversity” initiative?
I think, as a company, they should feel more than free to spend their money in any way they choose. I personally don't have a huge issue with that in theory. The biggest issue is that they are placing demographic above qualifications and interest. While that is certainly their right, I don't agree with quotas or hiring based off anything other than merit, and their choice of partner to pursue this is definitely questionable.
Where do you see #gamergate heading in the future?
I have very big hopes that we can impact not only the games media, but the media in general. When the spin in the delivery of facts is prioritized above the facts themselves, there is a very serious problem. I have no doubt that we will all keep fighting for creative artistic freedom, and against censorship.

Update: Lizzyf620 was doxxed and her family was personally threatened. She decided to leave the movement as a result of this attack. However, She left #gamergate a final letter before leaving.
Hey guys, Liz here. There's been a lot of talk the past few hours about what happened to me. Just to clear up a few things: I won't be back to Twitter. This was professionally and thoroughly done, likely paid for, by someone who wanted to intimidate me. It worked. I kept my children private for this reason, I knew that eventually they would be used as a weapon against me. My plan, all along, was if that occurred I would deactivate. I was fully prepared for this, and intend to stick with it. I ask that anyone with any decency respect this. I will not be on Reddit. There is already a username Lizzyf620 (seemingly to share to dox further). If you see a Twitter account, Reddit account, anything, claiming to be me, it's a lie. I'm heartbroken over this. I invested a large amount of myself into GG, but – unexpectedly – invested even more of myself into you guys. I feel like I've lost all of my friends, and that hurts more than anything. I adore you all, please don't doubt that. The relationships I formed with you guys were, and still are, very real. For me, at least. BOTH sides: this was not the work of GG, or anti-GG, or KIA, or Ghazi, or 8chan, or Baph. Don't blame groups, don't guilt by association. This is the responsibility of whoever posted it, and no one else. My life and my family are not politics, nor are they chess pieces in a match. They are mine, and only mine, and I ask that both sides respect this. If anyone needs to get in contact with me, as a friend, I'm still always here for you. You can reach me through @TheBrandonMorse , @TheFartRises , or @Noprivilegeme. I sincerely and truly love you all. Go make some ethics happen, and be kind to one another ♡

Walking to Sad Pianos While Pressing W is a pretentious waste of time and space. You are some beardman walking around a city. Then it ends. It's got achievements though. Kids like those.
Walking to Sad Pianos was a mistake.
Inspired by such "masterpieces" as Polygon's Game of the Year Gone Home, the actually great Stanley Parable, and the awful, awful, worthless piece of crap created by that non-dev FoldableHuman called Resist, which this game is a parody of, or something. I forgot what I was doing half-way through.
Blah.

WHY IS THERE A TEN MINUTE REVIEW OF THE GAME — WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE? I mean, The Button Buddies guys at Digitato played my game recently apparently maybe, so there you go. (Warning: It spoils the entire "game". Did I say "warning"? I meant "pro-tip".)
Review by Prometheum5
Ashley Wood is an Australian artist most recognized for his Spawn comic book cover paintings, Hellspawn comic illustration work, Metal Gear Solid art, and Tank-Girl work. More recently he has spent a great deal of time on his original properties Zombies vs. Robots (vs. Amazons), Popbot, World War Robot, and the newest, Adventure Kartel, working with ThreeZero toys of Hong Kong to form the toy-making partnership ThreeA, through which Ashley's original designs come to life. ThreeA toys are most recognizable by their incredible detail and weathered paintwork.
Halo is a long-running videogame franchise featuring genetically modified Spartan super soldiers in tricked-out space marine battle armor that has been just BEGGING for high-end toys for a while now. Halo: Reach was the 2010 installment of the franchise, chronicling a key event in the Halo mythology and introducing players to a variety of Spartans other than the series' protagonist, Master Chief.
When ThreeA announced they had acquired the Halo license, I was cautiously optimistic. The gritty Spartan designs were perfect for toys, but considerably more detailed than the usual ThreeA fare. The first 3A Halo figure announced was Noble One: Carter, leader of the elite Noble Squad from Halo: Reach. Carter was available for preorder on Bambaland and is still available from regular retailers. Available at the same time as the Carter direct from ThreeA was the Bambaland-exclusive Spartan MkV Commando. The Commando comes packed in a beautiful box with subtle detailing, safely encased in a vacuum tray.
The box features nice graphics detailing the included weapons. It's a departure from the usual stark graphics and bold type of Ashley Wood's boxes, and I quite like it.
Out of the box, Commando stands thirteen and a half inches tall and is fairly hefty. Much of the figure feels hollow, but there are many layers and moving parts to the construction that make it feel very detailed and robust. We've got some work to do before we can get to the meat of the review, though.
There are three battery compartments to fill. The first is a large opening exposed by removing the back armor. The back armor attaches securely by clips above the shoulders and on the armpit armor. One of the armpit panels was loose on mine out of the box and had to be re-glued, but nothing was actually damaged. There are also battery compartments in the backs of both biceps, with removable armor panels and battery doors secured with very small phillips head screws. Two CR2032H batteries are required for the back, and six AG4/LR626 batteries are required for the arms. Getting the tiny LR626s into the arms is a pain.
The back armor has terminals that mate up with pins in the back cavity to power the lights on the back armor. Care is needed to align the pins properly when reattaching the armor, but the plastic alignment pin helps. The annoying thing here is that the switch for the body lights is inside the back, so the armor plate must be removed each time to turn the lights on and off. Everything feels well made, but I worry about accidentally squishing the pins or breaking a tab over time. The switches for the arm lights are small and exposed like the switches on Hot Toys Iron Man figures.
Turning the lights on immediately washes away my annoyance with the back compartment. There are fiber optic light spots all over the armor that glow bright blue for a very high-tech videogame future effect.
The lights on the back look good, too. There is very little light bleed around the illuminated spots, which would spoil the effect.
3A's Commando is a gorgeous figure. The details are sharp, the lights great, and the paint is much more refined and subtle than on the main line stuff. There are light washes and drybrushing that accent the raised and engraved detail perfectly, with fine decals scattered about the armor.
The construction is a big part of why this figure works so well. All of the armor is molded in a lightweight plastic fixed over a softer material suit. Unlike other figures with undersuits, the black suit on this guy is made from multiple parts with layers covering seams and such, allowing for maximum articulation and durability. Areas like the shoulders and hips are extremely mobile, and there is little risk of the suit stressing and getting damaged from tight poses. The whole assembly adds up to a very durable and realistic looking toy.
Commando's hands are small marvels. Each digit is articulated, with multiple points of motion at the base of each digit for extra posability. The joints are tight and the hands feel well made, but I have heard some complaints of joints coming apart, but not actually breaking. With care, they feel like they should hold up.
There are a number of small accessories included that must be attached to the armor, including the shoulder pads, a fanny pack, chest doodads, and a sweet knife with scabbard.
In a surprising move, all of the accessories except for the chest gizmos are magnetic! Attachment via magnets allows for a very clean look with no small, fragile attachment points to risk breaking.
All assembled Commando earns his name. The little pouches and packs add sci-fi future soldier legitimacy, while the shoulder pads speak to that glorious customization available in Halo multiplayer.
The fit of the magnetic parts is generally precise, except for the knife. There is a 'sweet spot' where the knife sits, but it is not quite as secure as some of the other parts.
The shoulder pads and the fanny pack all have sculpted detail that helps them sit correctly on the armor. There is some play to how the grenades sit, but I think that helps them look more natural depending on the figure's pose.
The magnets also allow for a little bit of customization. The grenades can be stuck to other magnetic hardpoints on the body and accessories, if you're into that kind of thing.
Even armed with just his knife, the Commando looks incredible. The major joints on the figure all ratchet with a satisfying click, allowing this enormous figure to hold dynamic poses firmly. The range of motion is also excellent, allowing for very natural stances for a hulking genetically modified monster in sci-fi battle armor.
As I mentioned above, the scabbard for the combat blade does not attach all that securely. Without the knife in to help balance it, the scabbard spins around freely on its magnetic hardpoint. Not a huge deal, but something to watch out for.
Posable hands and sharp looking combat knives are made for each other.
Commando can also hold his grenades with a solid grip thanks to the hands. Astute viewers will also notice another accessory has popped up in this shot...
The Designated Marksman Rifle is a gorgeous piece of future-tech weaponry. It also has two magnets in it that mate up with two magnetic points on the back armor.
One magnet is a bit weaker than the other, so jarring the figure will often cause the DMR to come loose at one point and swing around. It actually still looks pretty good like this, so I am not complaining. In general the magnetic accessories are a fantastic idea that is well realized, allowing for playability without sacrificing detail.
Now that we've gotten all of the gritty stuff out of the way, we can get down to what matters. ThreeA's first Halo figure is completely amazing. I have nothing but gushy love for this figure. The detail is incredible and the smart design allows for it to still be an incredible satisfying toy that can be handled and holds cool poses.
He's just fun to mess around with. The articulation allows for a variety of cool poses within the limitations of the armor and accessories.
ThreeA's sculpt is bulky in all the right places and mobile enough to capture what Bungie's designers were going for with Halo's super soldier designs. Commando looks stoic and determined no matter the pose, ready to defend humanity.
Removing the right chest pouch bit allows for some great aiming down the sights poses with the DMR. Commando is not quire posable enough to look through the scope, but the scope is probably wired to the HUD view inside his helmet anyway.
Just mowing down some baddies...
My Commando tends to end up firing from the hips while drawing his knife to stab some alien fools. I do find myself wishing he came with the classic Halo pistol. The magnum pistol from the original Halo: Combat Evolved has something of a reputation as a death ray capable of killing anything a skilled played could see. I played a lot of Halo PC multiplayer back in the day, and I would also kill for a future release in 3A's Halo line to come with the Halo: CE shotgun. That was a good videogame shotgun.
I also wanted to show off how 3A's Spartan stacks up against other 1/6 scale figures. I love the fact that we live in an enlightened era where 1/6 scale figures are actually 1/6 scale and not just 12" tall. Next to a standard Hot Toys 1/6 figure, the Commando is a behemoth, as intended.
Posing the Commando with a squishy human really brings home how big and powerful the Spartan super soldiers are. I would also love to see a rank and file USNC or ODST grunt in the line.
Even among other armored characters with light-up features Commando is impressive.
There are few things better in life than a cross-universe meeting of armored heroes battling side by side.
Where would a Halo guy review be without a view down the sights at some alien scum? A nicely done 1/6 scale Covenant Elite would be incredible, but some Hot Toys Predators will have to do for now.
I could happily spend the rest of my days pitting 1/6 scale figures from different lines against each other. Aliens Versus Predator would have been a very different videogame franchise if the marines had been Spartan-IIIs equipped with MJOLNIR battle armor.
ThreeA's Commando (and Carter) retail for $219.99. For that price you get the best Halo action figure ever made, period. As I posted on Twitter when this guy came, any other company looking to make high-end Halo toys might as well just pack up shop. ThreeA's got this on lock. The price is more than competitive with other high-end 1/6 scale figures like Hot Toys' or Medicom releases, and the Halo guy is much larger, and in many cases far more complex. Minor quibbles with the batteries and such are easily overlooked for how impressive the complete package is. The engineering is great, and the execution is more than competent. ThreeA ahs really stepped up their game for this line, showing that they can take the right license the extra mile and produce something special. Fans of Halo, space maries, dudes in power armor, or even tokusatsu should give these a look. The Commando was a direct-order exclusive, but the regular Carter is still up for preorder from most retailers and should be shipping soon. I know I'm going to grab one.

The Hungaroring was the setting for the 11th round of the 2011 season. The weekend saw a series of milestones for drivers and teams. It was the 100th Grand Prix for both Nico Rosberg of Mercedes and Toro Rosso. It was also the 200th race for Jenson Button. He started his career in 2000 with Williams, and has driven for Benetton, Renault, BAR, Honda and Brawn before moving to his current team McLaren. His first win came at this circuit, in 2006 for BAR, but his greatest moment is undoubtedly becoming World Champion in 2009 with Brawn. Jarno Trulli was back in his race seat at Lotus, after Karun Chandok had replaced him at the Nurburgring.
Even though he hadn't won since Valencia, Sebastian Vettel still had a healthy lead in the championship. He was 77 points ahead of Red Bull team-mate, Mark Webber. The battle behind Vettel for the best-of-the-rest tag was tight, as Webber was only 5 points ahead of McLaren's Lewis Hamilton, with Ferrari's Fernando Alonso a further four points adrift. In the constructors', championship, Red Bull were miles ahead with a 112-points cushion over nearest rivals McLaren. Ferrari were a further 51 points adrift, but were well clear in third place from Mercedes and Lotus.
2011 Hungarian Grand Prix
In both Friday practise sessions, Hamilton was on top. Alonso was third in FP1, and second in FP2. Both Red Bulls were off the pace in FP2, and their team worked overtime to improve the cars performance. It worked as Vettel topped the time-sheets in the final practise session, three tenths off second-fastest driver Alonso. Hamilton, who had been the man of the day on Friday, could only muster the seventh fastest time of the session.
There were no real shocks in Q1, as the Lotus, Virgin and HRT cars were the ones that were eliminated. Toro Rosso's Sebastien Buemi qualified 18th, but due to his incident with Renault's Nick Heidfeld in Germany, he was demoted to 23rd place for the race. In Q2, everyone used the option tyres, apart from Hamilton, who was still able to get into Q3 with the sixth fastest time. Both Renaults and Williams failed to make the cut. They were joined by Force India's Paul di Resta, Sauber's Kamui Kobayashi and Toro Rosso's Jaime Alguersuari. In Q3, the Mercedes of Michael Schumacher and Sauber's Sergio Perez decided to sit out the session to save their tyres. Red Bull, McLaren and Ferrari decided to do two qualifying stints. In the first stint, Hamilton was slightly ahead of Vettel. In the final stint, Vettel improved to take his first pole position here, with Hamilton less than two tenths behind. Button was less than five hundredths off his team-mate, with the Ferrari pair ahead of Webber.

Variable weather conditions meant that the track was damp at the start of the race, which gave the added drama of what were the best tyres to be on. At the start, Vettel made a clean getaway, with the McLarens on his rear. Webber and the Ferrari pair, struggling in the conditions, dropped a few places. Rosberg and Schumacher were up to fourth and fifth respectively. Massa took seventh from Webber, and Alonso retook the position from Schumacher at the end of the first lap. Alonso got past Rosberg for fourth a few laps later, but then went wide at turn three, resulting in the German to regain the position. Hamilton was putting pressure on Vettel, and the German went off track at turn two, and lost the lead. Massa spans off at the same place, damaging his rear wing and ended up down in ninth place. Alonso got past Rosberg at turn one, and this time was able to keep fourth position. Webber and Massa pitted for dry tyres on lap 10. Button came in on lap 11, with Hamilton and Vettel coming in a lap later. This resulted in Button getting his tyres warmed up quicker, as he had been out an extra lap, and he was able to make a move on Vettel at turn two to go up to second place.
Webber was making a charge as well, and took Alonso at turn two for fourth position. Trulli retired due to a water leak on lap 17. A cracked exhaust pipe resulted in Heidfeld's car to catch fire just as he was coming out of the pits on lap 23, and he immediately retired and safely evacuated the burning vehicle. Massa was able to get alongside Schumacher, who had just come out of the pits, and the German lost control halfway through turn three., He had to retire shortly afterwards with a gearbox issue on lap 26. After Vettel's third pit stop, he was able to close on Alonso, and pass him on the outside at turn one. The rain returned, and Hamilton span at turn eight, resulting in him losing the lead to Button. As he tired to return on track from his spin, he forced di Resta off the road. D'Ambrosio spun his car in the pit lane, and narrowly avoided his mechanics. The tricky conditions caught out Button and Vettel at turn two, and handed Hamilton back the lead of the race.
On lap 52, Button had recovered and was able to get past Hamilton at turn one, but Lewis regained the position back at turn two. Hamilton and Webber pitted for intermediate tyres, but it was the wrong choice as the dry tyres were performing better, and they had to pit again for the slicks. Hamilton then learnt he was getting a drive-through penalty for his earlier incident with di Resta. On lap 55, Kovalainen suffered the same fate as his team-mate, and retired due to a water leak. The battle for eighth place was between Kobayashi, Beumi, Alguersuari, Sutil and Perez. Beumi got past the Japanese driver at turn one, but when his team-mate tired to follow suit, he clipped the Sauber, and ended up in 13th place. Webber encountered a number of back-markers in the middle sector, and this gave Hamilton the opportunity to close up and get past the Australian at turn 12 for fourth place. Alonso, who had stayed out on the dry tyres, was able to finish third, behind Vettel and race winner Button.

6 Massa +83.176 8

8 Buemi +1 Lap 4
9 Rosberg +1 Lap 2
10 Alguersuari +1 Lap 1
Even though it was the third consecutive race that Vettel had failed to win, he still extended his championship lead to 89 points over his nearest rival. The battle of second was even tighter now, with just four points separating the trio of Webber, Hamilton and Alonso. The day belonged to Button though, as in his 200th Grand Prix, and the location of his maiden victory, he took his second win of the season, and 11th in his F1 career.

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — The father of a blogger who was killed this week in the Maldives said Friday that his son received death threats for months from local gangs who appeared to hold radical religious views.
Hussain Rasheed, the father of Yameen Rasheed who was stabbed to death on Sunday, told reporters in neighbouring Sri Lanka that his son was a Muslim who spoke out in his blog against rising radical Islamic views in the Indian Ocean archipelago state.
Yameen was found Sunday on the staircase of his apartment building in the capital, Male, with multiple stab wounds. He died later in a hospital.
Rasheed said he counted 14 wounds on his son's chest alone and there were also cuts on his throat and head.
No arrests have been made. Rasheed called on the government to invite international experts to join the investigation into his son's murder.
Yameen criticized politicians and also spoke out on issues such as health, migrant workers' rights and policing. He was actively involved in seeking justice for his friend and journalist Ahmed Rilwan, who remains unaccounted for since being abducted about three years ago.
Maldives is a predominantly Sunni Muslim state where practicing other faiths and atheism are banned.
There has been rising radicalism in recent years. President Yameen Abdul Gayoom's government has also curbed freedom of speech and assembly, with heavy fines imposed on journalists and social media users who are found guilty of defamation.
They are some of Scotland's most spectacular locales that are proving increasingly popular with holidaymakers who realise there is no need to jet off to foreign climes in order to enjoy unspoilt beaches and stunning vistas.
Accommodation providers on some the nation's best-known islands have reported a boom in bookings for the first six months of 2016.
The spike in interest suggests tourists are turning their backs on traditionally popular overseas holidays in favour of a staycation.
As a result of the demand, people who have second homes on Scotland's islands are looking to cash in by turning their properties into self-catering accommodation, according to the letting company behind the research.
It shows that the Isle of Arran has experienced the largest jump in interest, with booking figures for the Firth of Clyde outpost up by 46 per cent in the first five months of this year compared to the same period in 2016.
Bookings for holiday homes on Skye jumped by 44 per cent, while around the country, there was a 25 per cent increase, according to Cottages & Castles.
Sue Bourne, the firm's manager, said: “The Scottish isles are renowned for their unique character, dramatic landscapes and some of the most stunning beaches around, so it's no surprise that holidaymakers are drawn to them in large numbers.
“We have had more second home island property owners join our portfolio this year who have recognised the increasing demand from visitors keen to enjoy the delights of a Scottish island holiday.
The company, part of the property consultancy, CKD Galbraith, said the allure of island getaways meant that many families were looking to stay in Scotland for their break rather than head abroad.
Ms Bourne added: “Our bookings in this segment of the market have risen considerably this year as a result of more families and couples choosing to explore the beautiful holiday destinations that Scotland has to offer.”
The latest accolade will likely encourage other people with holiday homes on desirable islands to set up their own self-catering accommodation.
On Arran, there are around 800 properties are listed as second homes, more than 20 per cent of all those on the island.
The significant increase in bookings and interest among tourists travelling to the island for a break is the second major boon for the island in as many months.
In June, it pipped the likes of Santorini and Capri to be named the best in all of Europe for accommodation, thanks to its glowing hotel reviews on the travel website, Trivago.
GLENDALE, Ariz. -- Even now, Arizona Coyotes captain Shane Doan shakes his head in disbelief, a sheepish grin spreading across the veteran's face at the memory.
It was last spring's annual gathering of the McCain Institute for International Leadership in Sedona, Arizona. Led by Senator John McCain, the lineup for a wide-ranging panel and group discussions on topics that included ISIS, medical breakthroughs and international human trafficking included a half-dozen senators from both sides of the American political spectrum, international ambassadors and heads of state, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, actress Demi Moore, four-star general and former head of the CIA David Patraeus and ... wait for it ... Shane Doan.
"It was honestly one of the coolest things I've ever experienced," Doan said.
"It was such a group of people that I don't associate with ever, but at the same time really, really enjoyed it. ... I was pretty excited to get the opportunity, but at the same time pretty nervous and probably had as much anxiety about speaking as I've ever had in my life."
McCain is a die-hard hockey and Coyotes fan, but it's clear that Doan's reputation as one of the great leaders in the game was also a factor in his invitation to discuss leadership through sport. From all reports, he was exceedingly well-received.
"It seemed so trivial -- anything [I] would have to say -- but at the same time they'd asked me, and so I was very honored to do it," Doan admitted.
And maybe that's why he was asked. He's a player who has always seemed to know what he was about and what it takes to bring out the best in others around him.
Part of his message to the group was that leadership is often about being true to one's self, being honest, straightforward.
What did he take back to the Coyotes' locker room after sharing his experiences with such an impressive group of individuals?
"It challenges you to be open-minded in your understanding of situations," Doan said. "Strengthens your belief in what you believe, but at the same time opens you to understanding the world's getting a lot smaller. So I guess in here you've got guys from Germany and Sweden and Czech and Finland and you have an understanding of people do things differently than you, so you may be a little bit more understanding than the 'Canadian' way."
Certainly Doan's invitation to talk about his experiences and the nature of leadership brings into sharper focus the reality of where the Halkirk, Alberta, native is at in his career, especially as it relates to his future with the only NHL franchise he's known since being selected by the Winnipeg Jets with the seventh overall draft pick in 1995.
Twenty years ago, Doan was attending his first NHL training camp with the Jets.
"What do I remember?" he said, thinking out loud. "I remember coming to the rink the first time and getting my jersey. That was unbelievable. I loved that jersey. That was a cool jersey, man. That's still, I think -- that's one of the nicest jerseys."

It brings back memories for Doan, who could have had no idea back in the fall of 1995 that he would move with the team after his rookie season and make his hockey home in the desert for the better part of two decades.
"When you walk into the room and you see your number hanging, and I was No. 21," said Doan, Shane who turned 39 on Oct. 10. "I was like, 'That's pretty cool,' and it was sitting there. It was pretty awesome. And then your camp -- I just remember all the guys were like men instead of being boys. I was like, 'Oh my goodness, these are men. These are men-men.' Kris King and Dave Manson. Teppo Numminen, meeting Teppo. Teemu Selanne was there.
"It was awesome. And it doesn't seem like that long ago," he added with a laugh.
But time has a way of sneaking up on you, doesn't it?
Now Doan is surrounded by similar fresh-faced, eager young men hoping to make their mark in the NHL, wondering what their own path will be like. And they look to Doan to help guide them, show them how to live the life.
There's Max Domi, 20, and Anthony Duclair, 20, and Tobias Rieder, 22, and Connor Murphy, 22.
A year ago, the Coyotes were among the NHL's worst teams, and a trip back to the playoffs this season seems to be on the long side of long shot.
Doan is in the final season of his contract and in the past there has been discussion about whether he'd be willing to or want to go somewhere else -- take a run at the Stanley Cup championship that has eluded him through almost 1,400 regular-season games.
To this point, he has resisted whatever urges there have been to try somewhere else.
If this is it, will there be regrets, remorse that he didn't pursue a different path as his career was winding down?
"I understand it would be easy to look at it and be like, 'Man, this could have been,'" Doan said.
"But I've never really tried to live that way. I've always tried to be -- I mean, they're all clichés -- but if you worry about that, then I'm going to miss what's going to happen next, and what happens next might be even better than what's happened back there, so let's not be so focused on what's happened back there that I miss what's happening right now."
What if players like Domi or Duclair or Jordan Martinook light it up this season?
"I might be on the first team that has three rookies score 50 goals. If I was worrying about what was going on [somewhere else], I'd miss the opportunity of that," Doan explained.
That said, when one reaches this stage of a career, it's also natural to wonder what is next -- where the road leads to or where, in fact, the road ends and another begins.
"I think it's impossible not to think about that. I don't care how long you've been there and how long you've been doing what you've been doing, I think everybody's always going to wonder," Doan acknowledged.
"What's that saying? If you want to hear God laugh, tell him your plans. We don't know what's going to happen. But you're always wondering about it. But at the same time, I think now that I'm older I don't need it to get here any faster than it's coming. I want to enjoy, I want to enjoy this training camp. I want to enjoy this exhibition game coming up if you're playing, because you understand that there's not -- there might not be as many ahead as I've gone through.
"You want to maybe keep that in perspective that this is pretty special and it's pretty awesome to get to do this, so I don't want to worry too much about what's going on next, then I miss what's happening right now."
So, does this mean we shouldn't ask him what he expects to be doing at the trade deadline in March?
He laughs again, an easy laugh.
"Nope," he said with a great smile. "We might be in first place."

Over the past 15 years – and contrary to popular belief – the world has made tremendous progress in reducing global poverty. One billion fewer people live in extreme poverty today than in 2000. This year, the rate of extreme global poverty is expected to fall below 10%, dropping into single digits for the first time in history. Inclusive economic growth, especially in China and India, has driven this success.
This kind of economic growth, which increases the income of the poorest 40%, is critical to reaching our global goal of ending poverty by 2030.
'We can be the first generation that ends poverty' Read more
We are the first generation in history that can end poverty, but we will lose this opportunity if we do not tackle climate change, which will affect all of our lives and could devastate the poorest. It may push more than 100 million people into poverty in the next 15 years, according to a new World Bank Group report.
Extreme weather conditions are already wreaking havoc across the world. This year's El Niño is expected to be one of the strongest yet, affecting billions of people in South and North America, Africa, Asia and the Pacific. Orange farmers in Florida, coffee growers in Indonesia, and tea harvesters in Kenya are among those who could see their crops damaged. The last time El Niño was this severe, in 1997-98, floods, fires, droughts and other disasters killed 30,000 people, displaced at least 24 million in China, India, Honduras and the Dominican Republic, and caused an estimated $100bn (£66bn) in damage.
Changing weather patterns will also increase the spread of disease carriers and infectious diseases like malaria, which is projected to strike about 214 million people in 2015. Almost 90% of these cases will be in sub-Saharan Africa. Rising global temperatures could put 150 million more people at risk and have a significant impact on productivity, undermining inclusive growth.

The poor will suffer the most. They often live, farm or hold assets in areas more exposed to droughts and floods, which puts their homes, crops and livestock at greater risk. Most have little access to bank accounts or social safety nets like health insurance, so they pay more than 50% of their health costs out of pocket. Without secure savings or public support, they often cannot recover from disasters or obtain treatment when sick.
Climate change is also expected to threaten our food security, potentially causing global crop losses of up to 5% by 2030. This could force food prices higher, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, where the majority of the world's extreme poor live. Such a scenario would make access to food more difficult and, by 2030, could leave another 7.5 million children facing nutritional and cognitive difficulties.
December's global climate change conference in Paris presents a critical opportunity to stop climate change from reversing global gains against poverty. An ambitious agreement backed by strong political will, can accelerate our transition to inclusive growth that reduces greenhouse gas emissions using renewable energy, efficiency upgrades and other steps. This would limit the future effects of climate change, create jobs and raise incomes.
The World Bank Group has made its own ambitious commitment to this cause. Last month, the group pledged to use its resources to increase support for developing countries' response to climate change by up to $29bn annually by 2020. This is an important step, opening up a credible path to the $100bn in annual climate finance that is integral to reaching a climate change agreement.
Paris presents a critical opportunity to stop climate change from reversing global gains against poverty
After Paris, we will help countries to use this support to insulate the poor and others from the effects of climate change based on their national plans. Together, we can expand safety nets and financial access, and strengthen health systems. We can increase the use of heat-resistant crops and other climate-smart agricultural practices, eliminate fuel subsidies in ways that minimise the impact on the poor, and use urban design to reduce cities' carbon emissions and make them more resilient.
The benefits can be immediate. In 2013, when Cyclone Phailin hit near Gopalpur, India, it killed fewer than 100 people, even though nearly 10,000 had died when a similar storm hit the area in 1999. The difference: early warning systems and evacuation plans introduced in the interim. In 2011, Ethiopia helped replace income that 3 million people lost to drought through a safety net programme that provides cash transfers for vulnerable households at times of crisis. The programme also pays communities to work on making their land more resistant to drought in the future, through building terraced fields to reduce soil erosion, for example, and it continues to shield Ethiopians from falling into poverty due to extreme weather.
International action on climate change must reflect our new understanding of what is at stake: the fate of hundreds of millions of people who live in extreme poverty today and the wellbeing of more than 100 million more who could be pushed into it. By doing the right thing, we will also push forward the cause of justice – we can preserve the planet for future generations and end extreme poverty. The two together will be humankind's greatest achievement.
The Republican Party's platform for the mid-term elections, its “Pledge to America,” is already regarded by most progressives and moderates as something that, if enacted, would be a huge step backwards.
Now, a new report confirms what many could have easily guessed: the Pledge has a sharply racist edge.
The racism can be detected even at first glance, wrote AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka.
“It shows off photos of 384 white people by our count,” the labor leader said. “One Asian American. A musician who might be Asian. One young man in military cam who may be Latino. And if you look very, very closely, five African Americans. A total of eight people of color.”
“What America are they pledging to?” Trumka asked.
Trumka pointed out that 34 percent of the population of the United States is non-white, and went on to ask why “agenda-setters in the Republican machinery think it's OK to ignore more than a third of the population … including (no coincidence) those who look like President Barack Obama.”
But the racism goes deeper than the pictures. While the policies in the Pledge, if enacted, slash services and harm the livelihoods of all working Americans, Blacks, Latinos and Asians would suffer the most.
“The American middle class as a whole continues to struggle as the economy very slowly comes out of the worst economic recession since the Great Depression,” wrote Tony Carrk in the report, from the Center for American Progress Action Fund. But already, he noted, the economic situation is worse for African Americans and Latinos. “The poverty rate among African Americans and Hispanics was nearly double the overall rate in 2009-25.8 percent for African Americans and 25.3 percent for Hispanics compared to an average 14.3 percent.”
The rates are comparably bad in other categories as well, including unemployment, child poverty and median household income.
While the Republicans don't want to extend tax cuts to regular working people, as President Obama advocates, they do favor extending Bush tax cuts for people who make over $250,000 yearly – the richest two percent of the population. That already small percentage of the U.S. population includes just 0.7 percent of African American families and 0.9 percent of Latino families.
This tax cut, which would give an average of $100,000 to each of the richest Americans, would cost the country $830 billion over the next decade. To make up for this, a 21 percent cut in spending on non-military discretionary programs would be necessary, meaning, for example, a $15 billion cut to education.
“At a time when graduation rates among communities of color lag behind white students and an achievement gap persists in our education system, communities of color can ill afford these reductions,” noted Carrk.
The Pledge would do away with Obama's signature health care reform even though, as Carrk wrote, “the mortality rate for African Americans was 1.6 times higher than for whites; half of Latinos and more than 25 percent of African Americans do not have a regular doctor, compared to 20 percent of white Americans; and people of color are more likely to suffer from a chronic disease such as diabetes or hypertension. Communities of color represent more than half of the uninsured population.”
And, instead of promising bipartisan reform of the immigration system, as Obama and most Democrats have advocated, the Pledge looks to adopt Arizona's draconian approach.
“If people of color needed a reason to vote in the November election,” said James Parks of the AFL-CIO, “the Republican Party gave them a handful.”
Of course, while people of color would be disproportionately harmed by the Pledge, white working people would suffer as well: only the richest two percent of the population would benefit. Trumka, Carrk and others argue that, to better living standards for all working people, a united fightback is necessary.
Trumka said that the recent One Nation rally was an example of such a united fight. It was a rally that would “issue a very different pledge to America. One that I – a white guy – will be part of, along with my brothers and sisters of many colors, many beliefs, many backgrounds.”
The rally, which brought over 100,000 people out to fight for jobs, better public education and immigration reform, was initiated by the Service Employees International Union and the NAACP.
Noting “there will be no ethnic majority in the United States by the year 2050,” Carrk argued “neglecting communities of color will have disastrous consequences for the long-term prosperity of our nation.”
Trumka pointed out that the Pledge did contain a picture of the Statue of Liberty.
The statue, of course, famously declares, “Give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”
But, says Trumka, “Just don't expect to see those huddled masses included in the GOP Pledge to America.”

Witnesses to the 'Biak massacre' in 1998 tell of alleged atrocities by Indonesian security forces
Scores of unarmed civilians were tortured and killed and their bodies dumped at sea in a massacre by Indonesian security forces in West Papua 15 years ago, a “citizens' tribunal” held in Sydney has found.
On 6 July 1998, West Papuans demonstrating for independence on the island of Biak were murdered in a co-ordinated attack by the Indonesian military and police and a large number were detained, according to the findings of the Biak Massacre Citizens' Tribunal.
Many of those in custody were subsequently raped and mutilated in horrific circumstances and the security personnel responsible for the attack have never been held accountable, the tribunal heard.
The citizens' tribunal was held this year at the University of Sydney on the 15th anniversary of the incident. The event was conducted in the manner of a coroner's inquest before presiding jurists John Dowd and Keith Suter, with former NSW director of public prosecutions Nick Cowdery as counsel assisting.
The co-ordinator of the event, Jim Elmslie, said much of the testimony heard by the tribunal was “incredibly shocking”.
“The viciousness with which [the attack] was carried out has left me shocked. And it's clear that it's not just one sick person doing this, it's a system,” he said.
The alleged incident occurred several days after the raising of the banned morning star flag by West Papuan political prisoner Filep Karma, which was attended by dozens of demonstrators. The attack was well planned by Indonesian security forces and local and regional officials were also involved, the tribunal heard.
One anonymous witness told the hearing: “The army and police were everywhere. Bullets were raining down. The sky was on fire. We could hear them shooting people.”
Another testified via video: “My family and others were directed down to the harbour … We followed the other families with our hands up over our heads. You could feel the bullets starting to fly over our heads … I could see so many children who had been killed. They were shot on the wharf. They died right there.”
Navy ships were used to dump the bodies at sea, the tribunal heard. Ferry Marisan, the director of the human rights organisation Elsham Papua, told the hearing that fishermen later found the bodies offshore.
“The bodies were mutilated. Some of them lost their legs or their genitals were not there,” he said.
Other witnesses told of being tortured and sexually abused in custody in the days and weeks following the attack.
One victim described being stripped naked in a room with other women and girls.
“Then I saw a man [a soldier] showing me a little knife, the one that you use to shave, and he said ‘we are going to use this to cut off your vagina, from above and below and from the left to the right'. A lit candle was penetrated inside me, they cut off my clitoris and they raped me.
“I saw a little girl and they raped her and she died,” she told the tribunal.
Out of the 12 women in detention “eight women were killed and four of us stayed alive”, she said.
Elmslie told Guardian Australia the purpose of the tribunal was to create an official record of the atrocity.
“The Biak massacre is widely known in anecdotal terms in West Papua as being a really severe event but it's not acknowledged officially at all – certainly not by the Indonesian government,” he said.
“It's rare that a situation in West Papua is definitively investigated – you often have lots of rumours or just stories that can be denied. We thought if we could establish, to a large degree of accuracy, the details of one event, it would be powerful and useful.
“By exposing that one event you expose the broader pattern of Indonesian occupation,” he said.
The tribunal found that the Indonesian government had attempted to play down the seriousness of the actions of the Indonesian security forces in Biak and had not punished those responsible.
It recommended that the Indonesian government be presented with the evidence and findings of the tribunal, that an investigation into the massacre be carried out by an independent prosecutor and that “criminal proceedings be instituted against such persons as may be found to have committed crimes and crimes against humanity”.
The Australian government, which is “responsible for training military and naval officers of Indonesia”, should also be provided with the evidence before the tribunal and should “pressure the government of Indonesia to commence appropriate investigations and criminal proceedings”, the report notes.
Dowd told Guardian Australia that this was the first time to his knowledge that such an event had been held in Australia and that while a citizens' tribunal had no legal power “it's a very useful vehicle to make sure these issues are not hidden under a carpet”.
“The publicity of things like this makes it less likely that this sort of thing will happen again. We can't undo the atrocity that occurred, but it sends a message to [the Indonesian] government … that they may not do it again.”
The tribunal was hosted by the Centre for Peace Conflict Studies at the University of Sydney.
Guardian Australia has seen a copy of the tribunal's findings, which will be released on Monday.
Baby's probably not allergic
Reuters
Parents are more likely to think their infant is allergic to certain foods than is actually the case, according to a new UK study.
Dr Taraneh Dean of the University of Portsmouth and her colleagues found that more than half (54%) of a group of one-year-olds is avoiding some foods because their parents perceived them to have had reactions to items such as cow's milk, wheat, eggs or additives.
But overall only 2-6% of the infants had clinically confirmed food hypersensitivity, the researchers report in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.
Dean and her team surveyed a group of 969 parents when their infants were three, six, nine and 12 months of age.
At one year, the infants underwent skin prick testing to investigate their sensitivity to a number of allergens.
During the course of the study, infants whose parents reported symptoms of food hypersensitivity had a test known as an open food challenge.
If these challenges suggested food hypersensitivity, the children then underwent double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges, which are considered the 'gold standard' in diagnosing food hypersensitivity.
At three months of age, according to parental reports, 14% of infants had adverse reactions to food, while 7% did by one year of age.
Among all the children, almost 26% had been reported at some point by their parents to have food hypersensitivity.
But open food challenges identified food hypersensitivity in just 14%, and double-blind, placebo controlled testing confirmed it in 6%.
Skin prick testing found just 2% of the children had sensitivity to milk, egg, fish, peanut, sesame or wheat.
"[The findings] emphasise the need for accurate diagnosis to prevent infants being on unnecessarily restricted diets, which may be associated with inadequate nutrition in this important period of growth and development," the researchers conclude.

Gerhard Schindler, the head of the German Intelligence Service (BND), faced calls to resign on Friday after a media report claimed that the spy agency passed information about European interests to US National Security Agency (NSA).
Bernd Riexinger, leader of the leftist the Left party called for Schindler to be sacked and tried for treason along with others who were responsible. The German government needed to be "brutally honest about disclosing how much German intelligence agencies, devoid of any form of democratic control, acted as stooges of US spy services," Riexinger demanded in the daily Mitteldeutsche Zeitung.
Green party parliamentary leader Anton Hofreiter also called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to "immediately dismiss" Schindler. Merkel would have to explain "why the German government lost control over the BND," Hofreiter said in comments to be published in Saturday's Bild newspaper.
The Social Democrats (SPD) - the junior partner in Merkel's grand coalition government - also demanded a commission to investigate the case.
"If it is revealed that the NSA has conducted economic espionage and spying in Europe, then there must be consequences to be dealt with," SPD deputy head Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel told reporters.
Support for Schindler
However, Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) warned against taken any hasty steps to remove the spy chief. "The responsibility need not necessarily be with the leadership of the organization," the CDU's Patrick Sensburg told reporters, adding that the case needed to be investigated.
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert refused to comment on Schindler's status, choosing instead to say that Germany desired close cooperation with US intelligence services against terrorism. In a statement released on Thursday, Merkel's office said it had "identified technical and organizational problems with the BND" and was "sending instructions on removing these."
German magazine Der Spiegel reported on Thursday on the BND helping the US' National Security Agency (NSA) in spying on European targets, including German interests. According to the report, one of the targets was Airbus, Europe's leading airplanes and defense manufacturer.

Remember those cartoons with the feisty Confederate snarling, “Lee surrendered. I didn't.” Well, Dixie has risen, but it seems more “If you can't beat ‘em, join ‘em.” Southern Hospitality now welcomes corporations as it once did travelers.
There is little respite from the national economic doldrums Americans endure due to debased dollars, tax and regulatory uncertainty plus a popular culture increasingly resentful of success. But internal shifts signal that the South beats the North in more than just SEC football dominance.
The South long disdained Yankee capitalism, but now in many respects she exhibits freer markets than her historic rival. Slavery, the ultimate infringement on freedom, severely impeded development. Adam Smith and numerous others long observed its debilitating drain on productivity.
In addition to crushing the spirits of slaves and corrupting the character of masters, slavery thwarted technological innovation and incarcerated capital in sub-optimal uses. Southern economic prowess proved illusory. Rebel forces fought ferociously, but wilted before the better fed, equipped and armed Union juggernaut.
The war destroyed what wealth slavery did spur. For example, despite suffering minimal battle devastation Mississippi went from amongst the wealthiest states (at least nominally) to America's poorest as she had the South's most concentrated slave economy.
Southern apologists absorbed Marxist designations of Northern industry as “wage slavery,” but during the Twentieth Century, such depictions looked increasingly ludicrous. Suburbs blossomed where the “exploited” bought homes and accumulated creature comforts far less prevalent in the South. Black factory workers in thriving cities like Detroit enjoyed greater prosperity than most southern whites.
Jim Crow restrictions and a culture which embraced “good ole boy” corruption instigated economic stagnation for a century after Appomattox. Enforced state discrimination befuddled the South's economy by restricting free movement between producers, customers and resources. Arbitrary government race regulations frustrated capital from finding its maximum productivity.
Booker T. Washington observed, “One man cannot hold another man down in the ditch without remaining down in the ditch with him.” While whites tried to wrestle blacks neither rose as they might have otherwise.
Once rid of such hindrances, Dixie's markets blossomed resulting in widespread economic expansion. Free people are productive people. Simultaneously, northern industrial states, perhaps slumbered by success after WWII, began discarding the free market platform which launched their affluence.
Many northern states deny workers the right to avoid union representation, decree burdensome red-tape and generally extract higher taxes to push public services for social needs previously met privately. Even those enamored with government programs must concede public spending requires robust private production.
After segregation ended, northern companies relocated southward to escape high taxes, combative unions and officious regulations. As the South became relatively more welcoming businesses migrated bringing Yankee industriousness and capital along. After experiencing unprecedented prosperity southerners haven't looked back.
This commercial migration reflects more than what economists call comparative advantage. If Detroit progresses beyond auto manufacturing to attract more advanced industries so much the better. Michigan would profit. Unfortunately, these shifts South and West haven't been complemented by Northern gains.
In private sector job growth between 1990 and 2010, the bottom fifteen states all fought for the Union except Hawaii. All fifteen enforce unionization. The only Union state east of the Mississippi in the top half of job creators was New Hampshire. Most southern states make the list although the best performers tend to be out west.
Right to Work laws don't prevent collective bargaining, but by allowing employees to opt out demonstrate unionization's lack of appeal. Perhaps workers perceive that since 1990 states allowing worker freedom have boosted private employment 37 percent compared to forced unionization states limping in at only 17 percent.
Ohio, Illinois and Michigan have lost the most jobs nationally. They languish with persistent unemployment despite workers departing below the Mason-Dixon Line. Rust Belt economies mire in past manufacturing glories unable to compete with cheaper, more productive labor elsewhere; nor to lure the capital necessary for lucrative technological innovation.
The Midwest's economic malaise is self inflicted. These states stymie capital and thus employment through counterproductive economic policies. States enslaved to Big Labor also generally confiscate higher taxes. Ten of the fifteen worst laggards for jobs also appear in the top fifteen most heavily taxed at the state and local levels.
Illinois, which recently increased taxes, on net, lost someone to another state every ten minutes between 1995 and 2009. More went to no income tax Texas than anywhere else. By earnings, the greatest beneficiary of Illinoisans' out-migration was Florida. Southern states have become more business friendly than their Rust Belt counterparts.
Per Kristina Rasmussen of the Illinois Policy Institute:
Illinoisans are packing up and bidding adieu to our high taxes and crushing labor laws. They're heading for states with lower tax burdens and more economic freedom. Places like Alabama and Mississippi may have not traditionally been known as beacons of prosperity, but they're winning the race for families and businesses. Freer markets improve everyday life significantly, and people respond to opportunities for growth.
This isn't all about warm weather. In 1960, no southern state cracked the top five in population. Only Texas and Florida made the top ten. Over the fifty ensuing years, the South's population surged. By 2010, Texas was second, Florida fourth and both Georgia and North Carolina had entered the top ten.
Arthur Laffer and Stephen Moore noted that from “1998 to 2007, more than 1,100 people every day including Sundays and holidays moved from the nine highest income-tax states . . . to the nine tax-haven states with no income tax” and “no-income tax states created 89% more jobs and had 32% faster personal income growth.”
In addition to the obvious loss of human capital and their income potential, high taxes repel investment. Inertia may slow existing enterprises from relocating, but no such impediment inhibits start-ups and seed capital from gravitating where greater returns avail.
Instead, sickly northern states bicker over what Ms. Rasmussen deemed “relics with pricey lobbyists.” Ohio unsuccessfully wooed Sears from Illinois recently, but neither state seems willing to welcome real growth by cutting taxes, curtailing bureaucracy and implementing Right to Work policies.
It's outstanding that the South has risen; now let's rejuvenate the North.
Hey you,
Just wanted to reach out. We know you must be feeling a bit lonely right now. We bet there are a lot of loud obnoxious voices telling you that you need to quit. But we're all still here.
null
We bet there's some soft and kind voices telling you to quit, too. They're the most dangerous. The ones are telling you “for your own good and for the good of the party” that it's time to give it up, you're only doing it for your ego now, call it a day, you've made your point, you'll get Trump elected if you go any further, and so on. We all know what they're saying. They're saying it to us, too.
We call that concern-trolling, here in the internet. That sickly-sweet lullaby talk that is pitched to depress your energy and slowly suffocate your perfectly healthy anger at a corrupt system that needs to die. It's a spell the status quo cast to create inertia. We are being shamed for being angry, and people are making fun of our rage and belittling us for fighting for an actual democracy, one that is driven by the will of the people, not one that is just a stage show directed by a few shady suits behind the scenes. The desired effect is confusion, sadness, and a ceasing of action. That's what they want. We must not give them that.
But you know what, Bernie? We don't even think we could give them that if we tried anymore. We look around and we have so many options. There are many paths opening up. If we can see some, you must be able to see many. One that really interests us right now is that amazing group of bi-partisan lawyers who, with the help of the FBI, have uncovered vast amounts of evidence of vote tampering going back to 2004, and are about to land that lawsuit on the Democrats right now, along with all the correct tallies from this primary season. We won't hear about it in the corporate media, which is why they are suing them, for being complicit in the crime. But according to the data they collected, you won already. If there is any kind of justice left, you will not only go to the convention with the moral victory, but you will go there with the most pledged delegates as well.
And of course, California is far from over. When the DNC instructed the poll volunteers to give Sanders' voters provisional ballots to vote with, we were sure they thought those ballots would end up where all the other provisional ballots in every primary so far have ended up — in the trash. But they overshot the mark a little, and with millions of voters ending up using these previously useless ballots, and with the huge gap between registered voters and votes counted now being way too obvious to ignore, the party is being forced to count them. Turns out you can cheat a bit too much.
And, there's the small issue of a criminal investigation.
null
Of course, we're all being told to come on, you knew it was corrupt but that's how it is, nothing you can do about it, what did you expect, it's always been this way, blah blah — the lullaby of inertia sings on, willing us back to sleep.
The thing is, we can't go back to sleep, Bernie. You woke us up with a fright. We've seen things, Bernie! Oh man, have we seen things. Horrible, dark things that have made our heart leap into our throats. Your campaign has been a year-long awakening into the nightmare-reality of just how insanely corrupt this so-called democracy is, and just how bad it's become. It's been jaw-dropping at times. There is no way we can un-see that. Every step your campaign took forward revealed more and more evil manipulation.
The other day, you were standing in front of the Californian flag, that big white flag with the brown grizzly bear in the middle. The brown grizzly bear that was hunted to complete annihilation within the state, and now exists there only as a symbol on the flag.
It struck me that that was the perfect metaphor for the Democrats. A party that hunted democracy to extinction and exists now only as a word in the name.
We've seen glimpses of that evil from out here, but you have been living inside the monster. How deeply terrifying that must be sometimes. Bernie, we want to know — is there anything worth salvaging from that institution we now ironically call the Democrats? We ask you because you've had the grand tour. We know you said you didn't want to split the party, but that was before you knew what the party really was. Is there any point keeping any of it at all?
null
You see, the way we see it, you're calling the shots now. It's endgame for the elite. They can either bring us into the fold and unite the party with you as leader and we reform the party from within, or they leave us all out in the cold and we destroy them completely in the general election when we vote you in resoundingly. We go with you. That's our strength and that's their inevitable defeat.
Either way, it's the end of the road for Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and co. They've played all their cards, and they've been forced to do many illegal things in the broad daylight already, with only the mist of a few media-created word spells to protect them. They don't have any moves left, bar assassination (yeah, okay, so we still worry about you a bit. God bless the Secret Service, am I right?).
Anyway, up to you. We are with you, Bernie, and we are willing to be guided by you wherever you take us next. Whatever your wisdom and the wisdom of the small circle of powerful women surrounding you tells you to do, we will come with you in huge numbers and with booming voices and with love in our hearts and with righteous anger that our spirits were being crushed under a corrupt system for so long. The beast has awoken. The revolution has begun.
In your words:
“Brothers and sisters, this is the nation we can create when we stand together and not let people divide us. “The history of America and the fight for human dignity is a history of struggle. They struggle because they said, ‘I am a human being,' ‘I have rights,' ‘You can't do that to me,' ‘I need dignity,' and unions were formed and people fought and people died and people were beaten and people went to jail. “When millions of people stand up, and fight… they win.”
We know now that the days of being crushed by that system are over. It's impotent now; it's inert. We're just shaking our fist at it, as it bolts out the door.
So where to next, Bernie? We need you to guide us into creating our new earth. Let's make some plans. What do you think we should do with the place?

Love,
The people.

Though most relational databases (like MySQL) are “row oriented”, in that they keep rows stored together… experience has taught us that pivoting the data arrow so that columns, and not rows, are stored together can be beneficial. This is an old observation that most experienced programmers know about as the array-of-struct versus struct-of-array choice. There is even a wikipedia page on the topic.
For example, in Java you might have a Point object containing three attributes (X, Y, and Z). You can store an array of Point objects. Or you could have three arrays (one for X, one for Y and one for Z). Which one is best depends on how you are using the data, you should consider both.
It is fairly common for databases to have tons of columns, and for analytical queries to bear only on a few columns. So it makes sense to keep the columns together.
There is actually a full spectrum of possibilities. For example, if you have a timestamp column, you might consider it as several separate columns that can be stored together (years, day, seconds). It is impossible in the abstract to tell how to best organize the data, you really need some domain knowledge about how you access the data.
In the data science world, I have been very interested in a new initiative called Apache Arrow. One way to view Apache Arrow is a common column-oriented database format that can be shared by many database engines.
Column-orientation is at its best when used with compression. Indeed, it is arguably easier and more efficient to compress columns stored together, than one they are interleaved with other columns.
Arrow relies on dictionary compression, a tried-and-true technique. It is a great technique that can enable really fast algorithm. The key idea is quite simple. Suppose that there are 256 distinct values in your column. Then you can represent them as numbers in [0,255], with a secondary lookup table to recover the actual values. That is, if you have N distinct values, you can store them using ceil(log(N)/log(2)) bits using binary packing (C code, Java code, Go code, C# code). Thus you might use just one byte per value instead of possibly much more. It is a great format that enables superb optimizations. For example you can accelerate dictionary decoding using SIMD instructions on most Intel and AMD processors released in the last 5 years.
In a widely read blog post, professor Abadi criticized Apache Arrow in these terms:
I assume that the Arrow developers will eventually read my 2006 paper on compression in column-stores and expand their compression options to include other schemes which can be operated on directly (such as run-length-encoding and bit-vector compression).
I thought I would comment a bit on this objection because I spent a lot of time hacking these problems.
Let me first establish the terminology:
Here are some considerations:
To sort, or not to sort? Run-length encoding is very powerful when the data is sorted. But you cannot have all columns in sorted order. If you have 20 columns, you might lexicographically sort the data on column 2 and 3, and then column 2 and 3 will be very highly compressible by run-length encoding, but other columns might not benefit so much from your sorting efforts. That's great if your queries focus on columns 2 and 3, but much less interesting if you have queries hitting all sorts of columns. You can duplicate your data, extracting small sets of overlapping columns, sorting the result, but that brings engineering overhead. You could try using sorting based on space-filling curves, but if you have lots of columns, that might be worse than useless. There are better alternatives such as Vortex or Multiple-List sort. Should you rely on sorting to improve compression? Certainly, many engines, like Druid, derive a lot of benefits from sorting. But it is more complicated than it seems. There are different ways to sort, and sorting is not always possible. Storing your data in distinct projection indexes like Vertica may or may not be a good option engineering-wise. The great thing about a simple dictionary encoding is that you do not need to ask these questions… There are more ways to compress than you know. I have been assuming (and I guess Adabi did the same) that dictionary coding was reliant on binary packing. But there are other techniques found in Oracle and SAP platforms. All of them assume that you divide your column data into blocks. By using dictionary coding again within each small block, you can achieve great compression because most blocks will see very few distinct column values. That's called indirect coding.
Another technique is called sparse coding, where you use a bit-vector to mark the occurrences of the most frequent value, followed by a list of the other values.
You also have prefixed coding where you record the first value in the block and how often it is repeated consecutively, before storing the rest of the block the usual manner. (We review these techniques in Section 6.1.1 of one of our papers.) But that is not all! You can also use patched coding techniques, such as FastPFor (C++ code, Java code). You could even get a good mileage out of a super fast Stream VByte. There are many, many techniques to choose from, with different trade-offs between engineering complexity, compression rates, and decoding speeds. Know your hardware! And every single processor you might care about would support SIMD instructions that can process several values at once. And yes, this includes Java through the Panama project (there is a great talk by top Oracle engineers on this topic). So you absolutely want to make it easy to benefit from these instructions since they are only getting better over time. Intel and AMD will popularize AVX-512, ARM is coming with SVE. I think that if you are designing for the future, you want to take into account SIMD instructions in the same way you would take into account multi-core or cloud-based processing. But we know less about doing this well than we could hope for. Be open, or else… Almost every single major data-processing platform that has emerged in the last decade has been either open source, sometimes with proprietary layers (e.g., Apache Hive), or built substantially on open source software (e.g., Amazon Redshift). There are exceptions, of course… Google has its own things, Vertica has done well. On the whole, however, the business trade-offs involved when building a data processing platform make open source increasingly important. You are either part of the ecosystem, or you are not.
So how do we build a column store for the future? I don't yet know, but my current bet is on Apache Arrow being our best foundation.

What you get On Tuesdays Sydney's Jazzgroove Association presents a couple of acts. At other times during the week you get local musicians, and a few more exotic flavours such as Afro-Cuban or Middle Eastern jazz. Weekend nights welcome established artists from Sydney and interstate. Late on Fridays, from 11.30pm to 2am, there are freestyle MC, poetry and singing sessions to a naturally evolving soundtrack of live jazz, soul and hip-hop. Musicians from R&B superstars Chaka Khan and Jill Scott's bands stopped by for a jam when in town recently. Feels like someone's lounge room: The Newsagency in Marrickville. Credit:Wolter Peeters Who's playing? Tonight: pianist Chris Cody, $21.50. Tomorrow: singer-songwriter Natalie Dietz, $21.50. Thursday: Mark Isaacs Trio featuring American bassist Jay Anderson, $27.50. MISS PEACHES Where is it? 201 Missenden Road, Newtown. misspeaches.com.au, 9557 7280.
What's the vibe? A neon arrow points you above the much-loved Marlborough Hotel in Newtown to Miss Peaches. It calls itself a ''soul food kitchen'' - and there are some hearty treats on its menu, such as cornbread sliders and collard greens - but it's also a stylish bar, all exposed brick walls and low ceiling, with a decent selection of North American beers. More importantly, the satisfyingly loud, swinging blues of Thursday-night house band Ray Beadle and the Silver Dollars brings a juke-joint feel and gets plenty of people dancing. (This is unsurprising - Sharon Hanley leads dance classes at Miss Peaches on Wednesdays and Thursdays for both beginners, $14 a lesson, and intermediate, $16.) What they say Richie Haines, general manager: ''The concept and main ideology of Miss Peaches is to transport the casual Sydney bar-goer over to the deep south of the States, through music, drinks and food. If we can allow people that release from their everyday lives in Sydney, then we have succeeded. Social club vibe: The Soda Factory in Surry Hills attracts big names for late-night shows. Credit:Wolter Peeters ''We've created a little piece of the southern States and transported it to Newtown and that is a very special thing to have done … Miss Peaches isn't just one thing or another, it has it all.'' What you get The three main concepts, Haines says, are ''a very strict music policy with its roots in '50s and '60s R&B and soul, a bar with the best ingredients and a kitchen pumping out our specific twist on southern food''. It's also worth noting that Miss Peaches is only open from Wednesday to Sunday, so no spontaneous visiting early in the week.

Sundays: Rickety Racket with music from bluegrass outfit 200k and others, free. THE NEWSAGENCY Where is it? 375 Enmore Road, Marrickville. alisonavron.com/the-newsagency, 8095 0246. What's the vibe? If it feels like you're watching a show in someone's lounge room at the Newsagency, you're not far off the mark - and not just because it seats only about 40 on primary-school chairs or because its lessee, singer-songwriter and singing teacher Alison Avron, intended to use this former news agency (if you hadn't yet guessed from its name) for her own professional purposes. As the acts performing here are often fellow local musician friends of Avron - not to mention that the Newsagency is an all-ages venue and family-friendly - there's a genuine warmth to the room; headline artists watch the support acts and cheer them on, and vice versa. There's no bar or kitchen but the Vic on the Park pub across the road offers a 10 per cent discount to Newsagency patrons, while Supreme Pizza next door delivers to your seat.
What they say Avron: ''The reason I took over the lease was because I wanted a place to teach singing out of. Then it just sort of evolved into this space where everyone wanted to come and perform … and now it's kind of an institution among independent singer-songwriters. It's a real listening space. It's not like a pub or bar where there's sort of incidental music - people come here specifically to listen to the artist. The music is the main priority.'' What you get ''Because it's so small it leans more towards solo/duo kind of folk stuff,'' Avron says. ''But, having said that, jazz goes down really well here - we've had up to six people on the stage before.'' Who's playing? Saturday: Matt Glass, Jamie MacDowell, $16.50.

THE SODA FACTORY Where is it? 16 Wentworth Ave, Surry Hills. sodafactory.com.au, 8096 9120.
What's the vibe? Behind the American diner facade welcoming you to ''Bobby's Boss Dogs'' on Wentworth Avenue is a pair of double doors that take you into our favourite venue of the four, the Soda Factory. Inside it looks nothing like a factory or, indeed, a diner; rather it's a warm, dimly lit room with a stage at one end (cutely decked out like a lounge room, complete with sofa and paintings), a bar in the middle and tables dotted around. There's none of the intimidating pretentiousness of some other city bars, the cocktail list is sensational and the food is delicious, if hardly healthy - an issue that will be addressed to some extent later this month when the Soda Factory extends the menu beyond hot dogs and fries to include a selection of salads, as well as yet more indulgent treats such as cheeseburger spring rolls and popcorn shrimp. What they say ''Boss Dog'' Graham Cordery: ''We wanted to be a lot of different things under one roof: a small bar-meets-American diner-meets-live-music venue - and do all of those things really well … You wouldn't really find a cocktail bar particularly at too many live music gigs. It's like a social club kind of vibe. It almost takes it back to the days where your restaurants and bars or clubs in the '50s and '60s - you know, you've got someone on stage but at the same time there's people eating dinner and having a drink.'' What you get Among the nightly attractions are $1 gourmet hot dogs and live acoustic music on Tuesdays, Mad Men-themed cocktails and rockabilly outfit Dick Smithers & the Doo Wops (and others) on Thursdays, and yet more live bands after the 5-7pm happy hour(s) on Fridays. Also look out for late-night sets from big names - indie stars Foals and Bloc Party have played post-gig DJ sets there, while singer-songwriter Jason Mraz performed an acoustic set after his recent Entertainment Centre gig.

The longtime New Year's Eve multi-venue gala known as First Night Worcester is no longer, with First Night Worcester Inc., which celebrated its 35th�anniversary last December, opting to stop running the event.
The family-friendly celebration, billed as the second-longest running event of its kind in the country, could continue in a different form, but whether it goes off this year remains to be seen.�
�After careful review, we have decided the 35th�would be our last event,� Executive Director Howard McGinn said in an email. �We are grateful to the many supporters who have enabled us to meet our mission over these many years. Most of all, we thank the tens of thousands who have attended our annual event.�
First Night Worcester, which in recent years has struggled to draw large crowds, nonetheless survived three-plus decades as a family-friendly, arts-centered festival.
The decision to shutter the doors of First Night Worcester Inc. was a difficult one, according to Board President Kallin Johnson.
�The Board is confident it has reached the correct business decision,� Johnson said, but we�ll miss setting the stage for thousands of smiling faces on New Year�s Eve.�
One of the founders of First Night Worcester, Charlie Washburn, noted the event's numerous supporters throughout the years.
�Some of our financial supporters have been with us since the early years, and many others have been very loyal,� Washburn said. �The fact that First Night Worcester is the second-longest running event of its kind in the country speaks to the generosity of many in the community.�
With First Night Worcester Inc. no longer involved, the city appears poised to keep the tradition alive in some manner. It would do so in partnership with the Worcester Regional Chamber of Commerce and Discover Central Massachusetts.
�A lot of good things are happening throughout Worcester and in the downtown,� Chamber president and CEO Tim Murray said. �A community celebration to mark the beginning of the New Year should be one of them. The Chamber and Discover Central Massachusetts look forward to working with the city to develop a new event in downtown Worcester. Along with City Manager Ed Augustus, I want to thank the First Night board, management and volunteers for their great work over the years.�
As for the immediate future of a New Year's Eve event, Murray said the short-term goal is to fit some sort of celebration in with City Manager Ed Augustus Jr's call for 100 events on City Common.
"I think it is something we want to take a hard look at," Murray said by telephone with Worcester Magazine Tuesday afternoon.
That could mean a scaled-down version, which could perhaps be built up in coming years - or it could mean, much like the city did with baseball and hockey, taking a year off.
"We're certainly going to try to pull something off this year, maybe smaller [than First Night Worcester]," Murray said.
As for what led to the end of the original First Night Worcester, Murray said changing appetites among visitors was a factor.
"There's shelf lives for everybody and everything," he said. "More and more people are staying home for entertainment. There are lots of factors. [Planners] have done a great job trying to keep it ... relevant. They weren't facing challenges any other organization isn't currently facing."
Worcester Magazine will continue to follow this developing story.

They say the best way to learn a language is to get stuck in, immersing yourself in a culture in a way that means you have no choice other than to adapt.
Human interactions, with all the real life quirks which make language so interesting, are essential if you are to become fluent.
I think these kinds of virtual environments are really great, really good. Kids in school respond very well to these sorts of approaches. Linda Parker, Association for Language Learning Listen to the whole feature on Digital Planet from the BBC World Service
In the past, you would have to fly out to various corners of the world to achieve such a level of immersion.
But now, in our ever-shrinking, networked world, the chance to learn new languages direct from the communities that speak it naturally is just a few clicks away.
Glovico.org calls itself a "fair-trade" language learning website, empowering people in the developing world to offer language learning opportunities to students in developed countries.
Supported by the Sainsbury Management Fellows' Society, Glovico signs up language teachers in places such as Peru and the Ivory Coast, and uses Skype to bring pupil and teacher together.
For an hourly fee of around 8 euros, the language-learner gets a one-on-one video tuition session. Glovico is a non-profit organisation, thus takes only a small amount - 2 euros - of the fee to maintain administration and infrastructure costs.
The rest is sent straight to the teacher by international money transfer. Glovico says the money earned from lessons is a big contribution to a teacher's monthly income.
"This is a fantastic opportunity for fair trade," said Phil Westcott, who represents the site in the UK and North America.
"As they build up a reputation and their ratings from the students improve, it will give an open market opportunity for these people to increase the amount that they charge for their lessons."
The rating system allows the site to crowd-source feedback to benefit potential students looking for a teacher. The tutors are rated on such factors as timeliness, competence and accent - as well as connection quality.
To ensure the quality of the teaching can be trusted, Glovico uses representatives in the respective countries to vet the teachers.
"We currently have operations in Senegal and Ivory Coast for French teachers and also in Guatemala, Peru and El Salvador for the Spanish teachers," explained Mr Westcott.
Virtual learners
Glovico is not the first to bring language learning to the web.
Language Lab is an online English-learning website which launched in 2005. Built on the once hugely-hyped Second Life platform, it aims to place students in a virtual environment which emulates real-life.
Image caption In Language Lab, learners enter a virtual English city
"Our teachers are all usually English teachers in normal schools who are picking up wages by coming home at night and doing a class," said Michael Lee, head of marketing for the site.
"People are immersed in a completely English city - there's everything from airports, to hospitals, to emergency scenarios. You can utilise and learn English in a way you'd previously never realised."
One particular scenario involved students being inside a burning building, and having to work together - using English - to evacuate and deal with the problem.
The site currently has around 600 active, paying members. But they say they expect this to grow massively as they are now taking on corporate clients - businesses and authorities who need to quickly teach English to a large group of employees, but can not afford to send people to lessons or for trips abroad.
Linda Parker, director of the Association for Language Learning, is enthusiastic about the possibilities of learning languages online.
"There are lots of different ways of learning languages.
"Different people learn in different ways. I think these kinds of virtual environments are really great, really good. Kids in school respond very well to these sorts of approaches."
She says that if a language is to be truly mastered it has be studied the old-fashioned way, but for learning enough to visit and enjoy other countries, learning online is great - particularly for people who are perhaps not keen on an intimidating classroom environment.
"It takes away some of that anxiety about language learning that people can sometimes experience in when they're in classroom.
"Anything that brings language alive, whether that's in the real world or the virtual world, is a good thing."
Scully captured them all eloquently, describing the play and then stepping away from the microphone to allow listeners and viewers to absorb the sights and sounds.
LOS ANGELES -- Vin Scully's legacy may be his calls of huge, dramatic moments -- Hank Aaron's 715th home run, Sandy Koufax's perfect game, Kirk Gibson's World Series moment.
LOS ANGELES -- Vin Scully's legacy may be his calls of huge, dramatic moments -- Hank Aaron's 715th home run, Sandy Koufax's perfect game, Kirk Gibson's World Series moment.
Scully captured them all eloquently, describing the play and then stepping away from the microphone to allow listeners and viewers to absorb the sights and sounds.
In fact, near the end of Clayton Kershaw's 2014 no-hitter, Scully said:
"Now it's his moment. What he does with it after 101 pitches, we are delighted to share the moment with you. Now if you don't mind, I'm going to sit back and watch it with you."
:: Farewell, Vin Scully ::
How perfect is that? Years from now when baseball fans and linguists and broadcasting students study this man, these big moments of history and anticipation surely will define Scully.
No artist could paint a more perfect picture than Scully captured at the end of Koufax's 1965 masterpiece. Or the words he used as Aaron rounded the bases after his 715th home run in 1974.
Still, to the millions of Dodgers fans who doted on his every word, the real joy of Vin Scully will always be found in the day-to-day work, the regular games where no history was made, no record shattered.
In those games, Scully was at his best -- warm and thoughtful, kind and funny, a perfect companion in cars, living rooms and box seats.
Scully's way of seamlessly weaving stories through every broadcast was unlike any other sportscaster, maybe ever.
Topics? He had a few.
One night, it was the history of Friday the 13th when discussing ballplayer superstitions.
Video: SF@LAD: Scully discusses history of Friday the 13th
Or the dirt on a baseball diamond, where it came from and why it was special.
Some dirt history, too.
Think it wasn't interesting? Guess again.
Scully's departure from the Dodgers broadcasting booth at the end of this, his 67th and final season, will last in our hearts and minds forever.
He elevated the broadcasting of baseball games to an art form. All of us have our favorite moments.
As Scully prepares for his final game at Dodger Stadium on Sunday, with his final game ever a week after in San Francisco, here is a look back at 10 of his calls that stand the test of time:
Koufax's perfect game
"So Harvey Kuenn is batting for Bob Hendley. The time on the scoreboard is 9:44. The date, September the 9th, 1965, and Koufax working on veteran Harvey Kuenn.
"Sandy into his windup and the pitch, a fastball for a strike! He has struck out, by the way, five consecutive batters, and that's gone unnoticed.
"Sandy ready, and the strike 1 pitch: very high, and he lost his hat. He really forced that one. That's only the second time tonight where I have had the feeling that Sandy threw instead of pitched, trying to get that little extra, and that time he tried so hard his hat fell off -- he took an extremely long stride to the plate -- and Torborg had to go up to get it.
"One and one to Harvey Kuenn. Now he's ready: fastball, high, ball 2. You can't blame a man for pushing just a little bit now. Sandy backs off, mops his forehead, runs his left index finger along his forehead, dries it off on his left pants leg. All the while Kuenn just waiting. Now Sandy looks in. Into his windup and the 2-1 pitch to Kuenn: swung on and missed, strike 2!
"It is 9:46 p.m.
"Two and 2 to Harvey Kuenn, one strike away. Sandy into his windup, here's the pitch:
"Swung on and missed, a perfect game!"
Scully said nothing for 38 seconds before resuming:
"On the scoreboard in right field, it is 9:46 p.m. in the City of the Angels, Los Angeles, California. And a crowd of 29,139 just sitting in to see the only pitcher in baseball history to hurl four no-hit, no-run games…
"Sandy Koufax, whose name will always remind you of strikeouts, did it with a flourish. He struck out the last six consecutive batters. So when he wrote his name in capital letters in the record book, that 'K' stands out more than the 'oufax."

Henry Aaron breaks Babe Ruth's all-time home run record
"What a marvelous moment for baseball, what a marvelous moment for Atlanta and the state of Georgia, what a marvelous moment for the country and the world. A black man is getting a standing ovation in the Deep South for breaking a record of an all-time baseball idol. And it is a great moment for all of us, and particularly for Henry Aaron."
Video: Vin Scully Top 20: #3 Henry Aaron's 715th home run
Game 6, 1986 World Series, Red Sox-Mets
Scully was prepared to describe the Red Sox celebrating their first World Series championship in 68 years. In an instant, it went away.
"Two outs, three and two to Mookie Wilson. Little roller up along first. Behind the bag. It gets through Buckner! Here comes Knight, and the Mets win it."
Video: WS1986 Gm6: Scully calls Mookie Wilson's epic at-bat
Injured Kirk Gibson's home run to win Game 1 of the 1988 World Series
In the clubhouse, Gibson had heard Scully say he wasn't in the dugout and wouldn't be in this game. Gibson grabbed a bat and decided otherwise.
"And look who's coming up… High fly ball into right field. She is gone!"
Scully goes quiet for a long pause as the crowd roars and Gibson circles the bases.
Finally:
"In a year that has been so improbable, the impossible has happened."
Video: WS1988 Gm1: Scully's call of Gibson memorable at-bat
Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series
As the inning began, Scully said: "Well, all right, let's all take a deep breath as we go to the most dramatic ninth inning in the history of baseball."
He said Yankee Stadium was "shivering in its concrete foundation."
When Larsen struck out Dale Mitchell to end it, Scully simply did his job.
"Got him! The greatest game ever pitched in baseball history by Don Larsen, a no-hitter, a perfect game in a World Series.
"Never in the history of the game has it ever happened in a World Series. Don Larsen pitches a perfect game, retiring 27 Dodgers in a row.
"When you put it in a World Series, you set the biggest diamond in the biggest ring."
Video: Vin Scully Top 20: #7 Don Larsen
Kershaw's no-hitter
"One out to go. One miserable measly out."
When television cameras showed Kershaw's nervous wife, Ellen, Scully worked her into the play-by-play:
"Hang in there, Ellen."
Later when Kershaw got the no-hitter and Ellen joined her husband on the field, Scully said:
"And when it's all said and done, escape all the noise, and talk about a dream come true with his wife Ellen.
"Big moment in a young life."

Rockies manager Jim Tracy's tantrum to umpires
This one won't make many best of lists, but it's Scully as his best cleaning up the manager's language with humor and precision:
"He caught the ball, Jim said. He caught the blinking ball. He caught the darn ball….
"That is blinkin' fertilizer.
"I'm doing my best to translate.
"You gotta be blinking me.
"No way.
"No blinking way.
"No bloody way."
Video: COL@LAD: Scully translates Tracy's ejection
From a 2006 Dodgers-Padres game
"It has been a Friday night and a Saturday night combined emotionally, but now it's starting to feel like Monday…
"The Dodgers are asked to do what they did [before], but they've run out of innings."
When J.D. Drew homered, Scully summed it up:
"What is that line? Do not go gentle into that good night. The Dodgers have decided they're not going to go into that night without howling and kicking."
Dirt?
"Looking at Clayton Kershaw's uniform with all the dirt on it reminds us of the importance of dirt ... Umpires get a certain dirt, and they rub the new balls before putting them in the game.
"Back in 1916, the Yankees were playing in the Polo Grounds, and whenever the Washington Senators came to New York to play the Yankees -- do you believe? -- they brought their own dirt .
"They would bring their own dirt to dry their hands. They claimed the soil around home plate at the Polo Grounds was trick dirt. Have you ever heard of trick dirt? ...
"Fastball banged into right field, base hit ...
"To conclude the thought, the Washington Senators, as they were then called, said that instead of drying the moisture on their hands, the dirt in the Polo Grounds made their hands slippery and the ball and bats harder to handle. How about that?"
Video: LAA@LAD: Scully discusses Giants using 'trick dirt'
Beards
As cameras panned the dugouts and field showing several players with beards, Scully said:
"If you've been looking at players with these big beards, I decided to do a little research on beards. Way back to the dawn of humanity, beards evolved because ladies liked them. No. 2, it was the idea of frightening off adversaries and wild animals. In fact, it was so serious there was a divine mandate for beards in Leviticus and Deuteronomy."

Bonus call (No, 11): Pearl Harbor Day
"I was 14, and it was the only time I ever hard my father swear. I was listening to a football game.
"And the count goes to one and two.
"They interrupted the game to say that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. I went into the kitchen where my mom and dad were having their usual cup of tea at that time of the day.
"I asked my dad, 'Where is Pearl Harbor?' He let out an expletive, which was really shocking. He never swore. He just said simply, 'That's war.'"

Officials said several drones delayed aerial firefighting efforts deployed to the so-called North Fire on Friday. Robert Kovacik reports for NBC News at 11 on Friday, July 17, 2015. (Published Saturday, July 18, 2015)
Drones forced the landing of planes deployed to fight the so-called North Fire in southern California that burned cars and homes along the 15 Freeway Friday, delaying response to the frightening blaze, officials said.
All air units not only pulled back from the fire because of the drones, but all five were forced to touch back down at the airport in San Bernardino after jettisoning their loads, John Miller of the U.S. Forest Service said.
The drones can pose a hazard to the planes, so the airspace must be closed to fixed-wing aircraft if they are seen in the air.
"It can kill our firefighters in the air ... They can strike one of these things and one of our aircraft could go down, killing the firefighters in the air. This is serious to us. It is a serious, not only life threat, not only to our firefighters in the air, but when we look at the vehicles that were overrun by fire, it was definitely a life-safety threat to the motorists on Interstate 15," said John Miller of U.S. Forest Service,
Images: North Fire Burns in Cajon Pass
Five drones were initially spotted over the fire, which consumed five homes and more than a dozen cars as motorists frantically fled on foot through the Cajon Pass.
Two drones actually gave chase to air units, and the incident delayed response by about 15 to 20 minutes, according to Battalion Chief Marc Peebles of San Bernardino County Fire Department.
When asked if the delay contributed to the fire jumping the 15 Freeway, Peebles said “It definitely contributed to it.”
Drones appearing overhead have become a growing concern as fire crews try to battle wildfires during the busy season across Southern California.
Similar incidents occurred during the fight to contain the massive Lake Fire and others.
As of 10:30 p.m., the fire, near Phelan, had grown to 3,500 acres and was just 5 percent contained.
Jonathan Tiernan-Locke (Team Sky) has requested that his biological passport hearing be delayed. No date had been confirmed for the hearing, but it was expected to have taken place in the last two months. Related Articles Tiernan-Locke ready for Ardennes campaign

Tiernan-Locke suspension confirmed by UK Anti-Doping
Today UK Anti-Doping confirmed that his hearing would now not happen until the summer. “The hearing of the anti-doping case against Mr Jonathan Tiernan-Locke has been postponed until the summer. This is at the athlete's request. Proceedings are confidential until their conclusion, as dictated by the Anti-Doping Rules.”
Tiernan-Locke was originally suspended in September 2013, just ahead of the World Championships in Florence, Italy. The Team Sky rider had been scheduled to race at the event, but pulled out at the last minute, supposedly lacking the form. It was later revealed in a letter to the Sunday Times that he had registered anomalous values in his blood passport.
The values in question date from his time on the Endura Racing team. Due to his success during the 2012 season, a number of WorldTour teams were interested in signing him – including Team Sky and Garmin. In order to make the step up, Tiernan-Locke became part of the UCI's biological passport system at the end of the 2012 season.
The 29-year-old was later suspended from Team Sky and hasn't raced since September 2013. The case was opened in December of the same year, but due to numerous delays it has been 156 days since then with no decision. UK Anti-Doping refused to give any further details on the exact date of the hearing.
“To protect the rights of all involved and the integrity of the process, we are unable to comment further or disclose exact timeframes, which are in any event changeable depending on outcomes. However, as soon as appropriate we will publish the decision on our website.”
Cyclingnews spoke to Team Sky, who responded with the same statement they issued in December 2013.
“Team Sky notes that Jonathan Tiernan-Locke has been charged with a violation of the UCI anti-doping rules. We have been informed that he intends to defend himself against that charge. Jonathan Tiernan-Locke will not ride for Team Sky or take part in any team activities – including training camps and all team duties – until a decision is made in this disciplinary hearing process.
“We understand that the violation was highlighted by an anomaly in his Biological Passport, in a reading taken before he signed for this team. There are no doubts about his approach or performance in Team Sky. This is a team that trains, races and wins clean. At this stage, we will add no further detail until this initial disciplinary process is concluded.”

Eighteen-year-old Kevin Norton, of Ames, and 27-year-old James Stumbo, of Boone, were held without bail on gun charges pending a September 1 hearing to determine whether they are a danger to society.
Authorities say the suspects referenced Columbine and the Boston Marathon bombing on social media. They were stopped on Thursday as they were about to register for the event.
They were released, but their car was seized after authorities learned they might have guns.
Officers executing a search warrant found a 12-gauge shotgun, an AR-15 rifle, several hundred rounds of ammunition, and a hunting knife in the car. Norton and Stumbo were arrested at their hotel.

It's natural to worry whether your child is getting enough food if they refuse to eat sometimes.
But it's perfectly normal for toddlers to refuse to eat or even taste new foods.
The trick is not to worry about what your child eats in a day or if they don't eat everything at mealtimes. It's more helpful to think about what they eat over a week.
If your child is active and gaining weight, and they seem well, then they're getting enough to eat.
As long as your child eats some food from the 4 main food groups (fruit and vegetables; potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and other starchy carbohydrates; dairy or dairy alternatives; and beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other proteins) you don't need to worry.
Gradually introduce other foods and keep going back to the foods your child didn't like before. Children's tastes change. One day they'll hate something, but a month later they may love it.
Keep offering a variety of foods – it may take lots of attempts before your child accepts some foods.

FORT PIERCE, Fla .— The young American suicide bomber who last weekend blew up an explosives-laden truck halfway across the world in Syria made his home in Florida, law enforcement officials said Friday. Records indicate the man played high school basketball in Vero Beach and lived at some point in Fort Pierce.
The 22-year-old, identified late Friday in news reports as Moner Mohammad Abusalha, is believed to have been the first American suicide bomber in Syria.
Few details have emerged on Abusalha, whose name was kept secret by federal authorities for most of Friday while they interviewed his family and friends — some of them elsewhere in Florida — and traced his movements, investigating whether he was recruited or radicalized online.
Basketball statistics posted on a youth sports web site show Abusalha played in 2007 for the Indian River Warriors, a team based in Vero Beach. Records show his parents have lived there and owned several grocery stores along the Treasure Coast.
Law enforcement sources told The Miami Herald that Abusalha resided, at least for some time, in Fort Pierce, about 130 miles north of Miami. The most recent address listed for him in public records — an apartment with a blue door in a one-story Fort Pierce building — now has a different tenant who said he didn't recognize Abusalha's name.
At the nearby Islamic Center of Fort Pierce, an imam who did not give his name declined an interview request late Friday. Earlier in the day, several men leaving an afternoon prayer who were shown Abusalha's photograph said they did not know him.
Photographs posted on jihadi social media sites show the suicide bomber purportedly in Syria, smiling and sporting a reddish-brown beard. In one of them, he is cradling a cat.
Those photos seem to match a Facebook profile for Moner Abusalha, who is pictured in one of his posts there standing in front of a beach. His other posts show Abusalha was religious and frequently mentioned prayer, God and the Prophet Muhammed. He also liked football, video games and Dunkin' Donuts.
In Syria, the suicide bomber was known by his nom de guerre, Abu Hurayra al Ameriki, or Abu Hurayra the American. The original Abu Hurayra was a companion of the Prophet Muhammed and is considered one of the most important figures in early Islamic history.
One of the two groups that claimed responsibility for the joint suicide bombing Sunday in Syria's Idlib Province, the Islamic Front's Suqour al Sham, confirmed the American's participation, according to spokesman Abu Farouk al Shami, who spoke with McClatchy via Skype. The other group involved was the Nusra Front, al-Qaida's Syrian franchise.
“It was an operation between mujahedeen from both Suqour al Sham and the Nusra Front,” Abu Farouk said of the blast, which targeted a Syrian military position and included at least three bombers and tons of explosives. “Abu Hurayra was well known to us in Suqour al Sham for his kindness and bravery in combat.”
Abu Farouk said that he never knew the American's real name, explaining that foreign members of Syrian rebel groups are instructed to adopt a nickname, or Kunya, in Arabic and to never reveal their actual name for security reasons.
“Their families could be targeted by police or the CIA for coming to Syria,” he said. “He would never share his name or show his passport, but we knew him to be American.”
In a martyrdom video released on YouTube, titled “The American Martyrdom for the Nusra Front,” the suicide bomber is seen praying, playing with cats and preparing for his apparent mission. The video ends with a tremendous explosion that is said to have been from the bomb he detonated. Abu Farouk said the tape was authentic, but his claim could not be independently verified.
A statement posted online by the Nusra Front said the American took off in a truck carrying 16 tons of explosives as part of one of four coordinated attacks. The group rarely grants interviews to Western media, and spokesmen were unavailable for comment.
The U.S. government designated the group a terrorist organization in 2012, saying at the time that Nusra was an alias for al-Qaida in Iraq, which was founded by Abu Musab Zarqawi, a Jordanian, to battle the U.S. presence there. That designation was recently updated to recognize that the organization is officially seen as an al-Qaida branch operating in Syria.
The American suicide bomber's ties to Florida were first reported by CNN. The Washington Post reported he was from South Florida, and The New York Times identified him as Abusalha. The Times also reported that Abusalha traveled to Syria late last year.
The office of Florida Sen. Bill Nelson said on Friday afternoon that he had been briefed on the situation. According to his office, the Democratic senator asked broader security questions about other Americans who have reportedly been associated with groups tied to al-Qaida.
Several weeks ago, FBI Director James Comey told reporters that investigators believe “dozens” of U.S. residents may have traveled to Syria to participate in the civil war.
“With time, more people are traveling from here to there,” Comey said, adding that “it's gotten at least marginally worse.”
In a separate briefing, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper estimated upward of 7,500 foreign fighters have joined the Syrian war. Comey estimated that “thousands” of these fighters came from European countries.
“There is going to be a diaspora out of Syria at some point,” Comey said. “And we are determined not to let lines get drawn between Syria today and a future 9/11.”

In the biggest exhibition of Soviet space artefacts ever seen outside Russia, London's Science Museum has launched a unique new display.
“Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age” contains many objects that have never previously left Russia, including a lunar lander five meters high and equipment from the space station. Record numbers of people are expected to visit the show before it closes in March next year and, in an unprecedented move to ensure no one misses out, the museum has introduced late entry on Fridays until 10pm.
Space woman
In the third hall of the dramatic exhibition is the actual spacecraft, the battered Vostok 6 descent module from 1963, in which Valentina Tereshkova orbited earth for nearly three days, becoming the first woman in space. Tereshkova, now 78, was at the museum for the exhibition's launch looking proudly authoritative next to the rusting, scorch-marked sphere that helped her to make history.

“Every time I see it, I stroke it and say ‘my best and most beautiful friend',” she said. Today, she is still the only woman to have piloted a solo space mission; Mary Archer, chair of the Science Museum Group, calls her “a legend in her own lifetime.”
Selected from a shortlist of five, Tereshkova was an expert parachutist before joining the space program. When the rocket launched, Tereshkova shouted: “Hey, sky, take your hat off! I'm coming to see you!” During her mission, she orbited the Earth 48 times. As the descent module hurtled back through the atmosphere at 17,000 miles per hour, its outer shell charred and blistered. Her early skydiving experience was vital as she parachuted out of her capsule five miles above earth.
Space toilet
Tereshkova has not been the museum's only celebrity guest. Sergei Krikalev, who flew into space six times, was at the opening alongside Tereshkova. Krikalev has spent a cumulative total of 803 days in orbit and was on the space station in 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed. “Our ground control kept working,” he recalls. “I think our operations in space were more stable than what was happening down on earth.”
American lunar astronaut Buzz Aldrin and Alexei Leonov, who became the first man to walk in space in 1965, also visited the museum earlier this year.
Some of the items have personal histories - designer Sergei Korolev's glove, cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov's woolly hat and Helen Sharman's space suit. A shower, fridge and toilet from the Mir station are on display. Tereshkova mentions drily that the equipment provided on her mission did not include a toothbrush. “Luckily I am very resourceful,” she says sternly, “as any woman would be.”
Elsewhere in the exhibition, an orange-suited mannequin in a Vostok ejector seat is tensed at an expectant angle behind a navigation console with multiple dials and a rotating globe. A model of the Venus lander and parachute hangs near lunar probes and the earliest image of the far side of the moon.

Russian pioneers
The exhibition explains Russia's driving role in the global space age, charting pioneering discoveries from the 19th century onwards, that eventually made it possible to send human beings into space. Besides mindboggling historical exhibits, like a dog ejector seat or lunar roving vehicle, there are displays of posters, photographs and documents.
While less immediately compelling than the physical objects, this paper record of the last century's achievements is equally fascinating. There is a page from the notebook of groundbreaking theoretician, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and posters that celebrate the Soviet space program.

Science Museum director, Ian Blatchford, explains that they want to convey the atmosphere of these early days: “it's difficult for people now to imagine how sensational Sputnik was,” he says. His favorite celebratory item is a Sputnik-shaped samovar. Leonov's self-portrait, in orbit above the Black Sea, is also on show and conveys a powerful sense of humanity's cosmic achievements.
Tsiolkovsky sketched pencil figures in 1933 that predicted spacewalks, weightlessness and life in orbit three decades before they were actually possible. “He laid the foundations in terms of dreaming about space,” says Blatchford, “but also in terms of science.”
Unique opportunity
Most of these exhibits have never previously been seen outside Russia and some were declassified specifically for this exhibition. The 150 objects have been borrowed from 18 different collections. The museum director describes the show as “a once-in-a-lifetime exhibition that has taken years of dedication and skill … to make a reality”. His staff collaborated with Russian Exhibition Centre ROSIZO and Space Agency, Roscosmos.
Tereshkova says she has always been motivated by a desire for global cooperation: “I belonged to the generation of war children; we dreamed of peace.” She is delighted at the level of interest the show is generating in London and the links it fosters between British and Russian scientists: “such exhibitions enable them to meet more often,” she says. After a morning in the museum, she and Blatchford are already cheerfully planning to go into space together as “proof of Russo-British cooperation!”
Blatchford takes a controversial view of the space race, claiming that the first nation on the moon was actually Russia, whose unmanned Lunar 9 landed there in 1966 - three years before Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon. The exhibition seeks to celebrate achievements like this that have not been fully appreciated over the intervening decades. Blatchford calls the Russian space program “one of the great intellectual, scientific and engineering successes of the 20th century.”
The exhibition will run until March 13, 2016. For tickets and further details, visit sciencemuseum.org.uk/cosmonauts.

According to some people, if you want to go out on the pull, conventional wisdom says that you go with your friend who has that giant goiter and a weeping facial wound. Some crappy scientists have officially subscribed to this theory, presumably to drum up publicity for science and get more funding for research into how to blast meteorites out of Earth's trajectory. Unfortunately, some other scientists disagree totally and think that you've got to stand with someone so insurmountably hotter than you so the glory will reflect back on your nasty face. In an effort to get to the bottom of this heated debate, I was photographed while standing next to the assorted masses of London to see which made me look sexiest. Judge me. I can take it.
Do I look attractive while standing next to this impressively bearded man?

National Association of Theatre Owners president-CEO John Fithian -- during his joint state-of-the-industry address at CinemaCon with Motion Picture Association of America chairman-CEO Chris Dodd -- said the digital promise is being fulfilled.
Twentieth Century Fox has become the first major Hollywood studio to officially notify theater owners that it will distribute all of its films domestically in a digital format within the next year or two, bringing an end to 35mm film prints.
National Association of Theatre Owners president and CEO John Fithian, addressing CinemaCon in Las Vegas on Tuesday, revealed that Fox sent a letter to exhibitors in late 2011. Overseas, Fox already has ceased distributing 35mm prints in Hong Kong, effective Jan. 1.

"Last year, I stood on this stage and predicted that domestic distribution of movies in the format of celluloid film could cease by the end of 2013. That prediction is becoming a reality," Fithian said. "As a letter from our friends at Fox confirms, no one should rely on the distribution of film prints much longer.
"And we know that most other distributors share that belief," he added. "Given this reality, the entire industry continues our efforts to bring the promise of digital cinema to all exhibitors."
Fithian said 27,000 U.S. screens have been converted to digital, more than two-thirds of the total, and promised that efforts to help smaller cinema operators convert to digital continue in earnest. The movement to digital is designed to cut down dramatically on print fees and projection costs.
Other hot topics addressed by Fithian and Motion Picture Association of America chairman and CEO Chris Dodd in their joint state-of-the-industry address included premium VOD and the resurgence of the domestic box office.
Also, in a press briefing following their speeches, Dodd suggested that the rift between Hollywood and Silicon Valley over recent online piracy legislation could solve itself without congressional input if the sides can come to an understanding.
"SOPA is dead," he said in reference to the Stop Online Piracy Act, which lost support on Capitol Hill in January in a major defeat for Dodd and the MPAA.
Dodd said entertainment companies and technology firms could sign a memo of understanding whereby piracy sites are identified by certain means, but he didn't rule out another round of legislation that could be supported by both sides. He also conceded the consumer was left out of the discussion by the MPAA during the SOPA battle.
On the subject of premium VOD, both speakers said studios and exhibitors no longer are feuding over the topic and are working to find an acceptable compromise.
"We are not just improving and reimagining our product," Dodd said. "We are also evolving our business model, experimenting with new offerings that will allow consumers to purchase the content they want to see and view on the platforms they want to use, at a price that's right for them.
"That in no way changes the simple fact that the best way to see our movies is in your theaters, in the dark, on the big screen," he added. "I believe that very passionately, but more importantly, the studios I represent do as well."
Fithian and Dodd applauded the resurgence of the domestic box office, with first-quarter 2012 revenue up 23 percent year-over-year and attendance up 22 percent. Last year, domestic box-office revenue fell by 4 percent, accompanied by a steep 16 percent decline in attendance.
"Doomsday reporters drafted industry epitaphs, while 25-year-old Wall Street analysts questioned the continuing viability of the exhibition industry -- what a difference a year makes," Fithian said. "With diverse fare appealing across different demographics and the biggest March movie opening in the history of the business, the movies have come back to our screens, and the patrons have returned to our seats."
In the separate briefing with reporters, Dodd also addressed the recent dust-up over the R-rating assigned to Lee Hirsch's documentary Bullly for language. Dodd defended the ratings system, but said the system could be more "transparent" in terms letting the public know how decisions are made.
Former Atlanta Braves pitcher Tommy Hanson died from delayed complications of cocaine and alcohol toxicity, according to autopsy results released Friday morning.
Hanson, 29, was at a friend's Newnan-area home on Nov. 8 when he was found unresponsive in bed. That friend's girlfriend, Clare Jordan, called 911 to report Hanson's face was discolored and his hands were cold, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution previously reported. Jordan began chest compressions on the 6-foot-6 Hanson until Coweta County paramedics arrived.
Hanson was first taken to Piedmont Newnan Hospital and then Piedmont Hospital's main campus in Atlanta, where he died the following night. The GBI completed the autopsy on Hanson, but toxicology testing took an additional four weeks to complete.
The death was ruled accidental, Coweta Coroner Richard Hawk said Friday.
A preliminary report released by the Coweta County Sheriff's Office listed “overdose” as the possible crime, but said there was no indication or suspicion of foul play.
Hanson was spending the weekend with friend, Brandon Bond, when he was found unresponsive. During the 911 call, Jordan told the operator she knew Hanson had been drinking alcohol the night before, but that he appeared fine earlier that morning when she went downstairs, where he had been sleeping.
Jordan told the operator she had let Hanson's dogs outside earlier that morning, The AJC reported. When one of the dogs started barking again, Jordan went back downstairs.
“I just came down here again because one of his dogs was barking and I wanted to make sure everything was OK,” Jordan told the operator. “And he just didn't look right.”
Once a top prospect, Hanson was traded by the Braves in December 2012 and last pitched in the majors in 2013 with the Los Angeles Angels. He had a 49-35 record and 3.80 ERA in 123 games (121 starts) over five major league seasons, including four with the Braves, before shoulder problems and a concussion stalled his career.
Many former and current Braves players, including Freddie Freeman, Brian McCann and Kris Medlen, attended Hanson's funeral, along with former Braves manager Bobby Cox and current manager Fredi Gonzalez.
White-nose syndrome has now been confirmed in 26 states and five Canadian provinces, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reports.
On May 19, the U.S. Forest Service and partners released bats in Missouri that had contracted white-nose syndrome last fall but were treated with a bacterium over the winter and survived.
The treated bats will be monitored to see if they remain healthy. Early results show promise at thwarting the disease and even reducing it in infected bats, although researchers haven't figured out how to treat more than a few bats at a time.
In another study, University of California-Santa Cruz researchers in April published the results of laboratory studies that showed how bacteria found naturally on some bats inhibited growth of the fungus that causes the disease.
It's not clear how the bacteria works or why some bats have it and others don't.
Not all of the news is bad. In one Vermont cave where a quarter-million bats died a few years ago from white-nose syndrome, a few bats have returned. Scientists are trying to find out why they survived when others couldn't.
Meanwhile, a wildlife veterinarian at the University of Wisconsin confirmed the disease kills bats by causing their bodies to overheat, burning energy too quickly and at a time — in winter — when no insects are present to replace the lost calories.
Researchers also are working to find fungicides that might kill white-nose syndrome. And scientists at UC San Francisco and Brown University recently figured out the likely way that white-nose syndrome breaks down tissue in bats, opening the door to potential treatments.
“The results of this new research sound promising, and we are hopeful that it may eventually give us a safe and effective treatment to use in the field,” said Jeremy Coleman, white-nose syndrome national coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in a statement. “As more potential treatments continue to be developed, we are optimistic that we are nearing a tipping point in our ability to combat WNS.”
In the meantime, experts say the best thing that can be done for bats is to make sure as many survive as possible, that their reproduction continues and that the bats we have remained healthy, well-fed and well-sheltered in summer before they enter their winter caves to hibernate.

Asked to demonstrate computer skills, 0 of 9 law firms passed in-house hiring test
Update: Frustrated by big bills for routine matters, D. Casey Flaherty, who serves corporate counsel at Kia Motors America, struck back with a computer skills test for potential law firm hires.
Invited to submit an associate of their choice for testing, the first nine firms flunked, Flaherty, a keynote speaker, told a large group attending the LegalTech West Coast conference in Los Angeles this week. One firm, he said, flunked twice, Law Technology News reports.
Not all of those first nine firms were BigLaw firms, Flaherty told the ABA Journal. “Most were. But not all. And, indeed, the smallest of the firms also was, by far, the best.”
The issue is time, Flaherty explained in his talk on “Raising the Bar on Technological Competence—the Outside Counsel Tech Audit.” Multiply a Microsoft Word or Excel task that should take seconds by minutes, especially if it is performed again and again, and it can add up to a significant amount of money at law firms' billable rates.
“The audit should take one hour,” he said, “but the average pace is five hours.”
Examples of tasks associates had trouble completing swiftly, because they obviously aren't being trained on such skills, included providing PDF documents for court submissions and getting documents Bates-numbered.
Although Flaherty conducted the skills audit for the nine law firms himself, he is working with an outside training firm to automate the skills audit. He then plans to provide it at no cost to general counsel at other companies.
An earlier Law Technology News video and two articles (Law Technology News, Jan. 24, 2013. and Law Technology News, Jan. 25, 2013) provide further details.
Updated May 24 to include clarifications from Flaherty.
After going through nearly $150 million in funding, peer-to-peer used-car marketplace Beepi.com is shifting gears. TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that the startup is shutting down its operations outside of California, laying off 180 staff, and merging its remaining business with Fair.com, a new venture co-founded by several car industry veterans that has yet to launch.
The reduced size will leave Beepi with 80 employees. They are being told about the fate of the company this morning.
TechCrunch understands that Beepi hit some bumps this year when one of its key strategic investors out of China decided that it wanted to pull out of the startup.
A Beepi spokesperson would not confirm which backer pulled out but we believe it is Chinese automaker SAIC, which was revealed as an investor earlier this year leading a $70 million round in December 2015. Pointedly, that round had originally been targeted for $300 million when Beepi first started to raise in May 2015.
We also have learned that Beepi also approached at least one competitor to try to sell itself.
“We've suspected that this may happen; in fact Beepi even approached us recently about buying their company,” wrote George Arison, co-founder and CEO of Beepi's rival Shift, in an internal email to his staff shared with TechCrunch. Shift, which has raised $74 million, including a $50 million round from Goldman Sachs last year, has instead turned its attention to picking up customers in the wake of Beepi winding down its marketing and other business.
So into the vacuum came Fair . The still-stealth venture is fronted by Georg Bauer, formerly of BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Tesla; Scott Painter, formerly of TrueCar; and Fedor Artiles, formerly of Mercedes-Benz, Chrysler, Volkswagen, and Tesla.
There are not many details yet of what the three plan to do with Fair, or when it will officially launch, but it's fair to assume (sorry) that it will involve another go at the business of trading in cars with a very extended wrapper of customer service around that.
Fair's site, as it is now, hints at a platform for people not to buy cars outright but instead move to a flexible leasing model and a car selector based on your finances. “Enjoy the freedom to drive the car you want for as long as you want,” it notes. “And when you're ready, you can trade up, try something new, or just walk away.”
Beepi's business, which never expanded outside the U.S. but had been live in some 16 markets before today, was based around the idea of users consigning their cars to the company, which would inspect and spruce them up, sell them online, and then deliver them to their new owners.
You may have seen the company's distinctive bows across the hoods of the cars, if you've never used the service yourself. “Everyone gets a bow”, the company notes on its site. The cars would look practically new, but the prices were a huge drop on those of actually new vehicles.
In a way, however, the business of users cars is as old as cars itself, and it seems that what Beepi was doing was not as defensible as it hoped it would be. Other dealers soon also began offering the same perks, but with a far smaller cost base, since they would already have established, more localised businesses.
It will be interesting to see what kind of twist Fair.com will put on this model and whether they can drive a business that Beepi could not. Ale Resnik, co-founder and CEO of Beepi, is staying on and believes that they will.
“Georg, Scott, and Fedor are auto industry veterans that I deeply admire, and I'm excited to join forces with them to focus on the future of the car-buying industry,” he said in a statement. “Beepi will benefit immeasurably from this partnership.”
Prior to this merger, Beepi had raised $149 million with other investors including Yuri Milner, Fabrice Grinda, Comerica and Foundation Capital, among some 35 others.
Updated with revised statement, comment from Shift, more detail of new business.
The Taxpayer March on Washington (also known as the 9/12 Tea Party) was a Tea Party protest march from Freedom Plaza to the United States Capitol held on September 12, 2009, in Washington, D.C.[1][2] The event coincided with similar protests organized in various cities across the nation.[3] The protesters rallied against what they consider big government, the dismantling of free market capitalism, abortion, and President Barack Obama's proposals on health care reform, taxation, and federal spending, among other issues.[3][4][5][6][7][8]
The lead organizer of the event was Brendan Steinhauser, who was serving as the Director of Federal and State Campaigns for FreedomWorks. Organizers of the event included the 9-12 Project, FreedomWorks, the National Taxpayers Union, The Heartland Institute, Americans for Tax Reform, Tea Party Patriots, ResistNet and Americans for Prosperity.[9][10][11][12][13] The event was also promoted by Fox News commentator Glenn Beck as a symbol of what he called "national unity" following the eight-year anniversary of the September 11 attacks.[14][15] The march is the largest gathering of fiscal conservatives ever held in Washington, D.C.,[16][17] as well as the largest demonstration against President Obama's administration.[4]
A wide range of crowd estimates was suggested for the event,[18] with most media sourcing the Public Information Officer of the D.C. Fire Department, who unofficially estimated the attendance "in excess of 75,000" people.[1][18][19][20] The D.C. Fire Department later released a statement saying that they do not do crowd estimates, and any crowd estimation attributed to them was false; they also stated that an early estimate of 60,000 over Twitter was for a specific area, Freedom Plaza, not the total number of participants in the event.[21] Event organizers also reported a range of attendance. FreedomWorks suggested between 600,000 and 800,000 participants while National Taxpayers Union said 200,000 to 300,000.[18]
Event activity [ edit ]
Timeline [ edit ]
Protesters on the West Lawn looking toward the United States Capitol Building
FreedomWorks began planning the event in March 2009, according to a FreedomWorks spokesperson.[12] The political advocacy groups Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks were "probably the leading partners" in the event, according to The Guardian.[13]
On Saturday, September 12, participants gathered at Freedom Plaza, located just east of the White House.[22] The march was scheduled to proceed Pennsylvania Avenue at 11:30 a.m., led by a fife and drum corps, and march towards Capitol Hill; however due to a larger-than-expected number of protesters, the Plaza and surrounding area became overcrowded and the march set off one hour ahead of schedule.[23][24]
C-SPAN recorded the entire two-hour-50-minute rally, which was officially kicked off at 1:11 p.m. with a welcoming speech by Jenny Beth Martin, the co-founder and national coordinator of Tea Party Patriots.[25]
During the march, most protesters sang patriotic songs, chanted political slogans, waved the American flag or yellow Gadsden flag, or held signs covering a wide range of political topics.[3][5][19][26]
Signage [ edit ]
Though many of the signs were close to the original Tea Party message of "Taxed Enough Already," such as "Stop Obama's Spending Spree," some of the handwritten signs carried by protesters included statements such as "Liar Liar Pants on Fire!" and "Hey Obamacare! Hands off my body".[5][27][28] Other signs promoted Obama citizenship conspiracy theories, depicted the Obama "Joker" image, and compared Obama to Adolf Hitler.[3][5][19][29] One protester commented that many signs were "expressing concerns about the tax burdens to be carried by "our grandchildren" and other signs he didn't feel were appropriate to repeat".[30] Gene Healy, author and vice president at the libertarian Cato Institute, expressed the opinion that the signs generally focused on opposition to government bailouts, Obama's proposal on health care reform, and the appointment of presidential "czars".[27]
Speakers [ edit ]
Among the speakers at the rally were former House Majority Leader Dick Armey, chairman of FreedomWorks, and a small number of congressional Republicans including Representative Mike Pence, chairman of the House Republican Conference, Representative Tom Price of Georgia, Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, and Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. Pence said that "Americans want health care reform, but they don't want government takeover".[30][31][32]
Attendance [ edit ]
Following the event, a wide range of crowd estimates was reported by organizers, protesters, and members of the media.[18] The space occupied by the crowd extended from the Capitol lawn down around the National Mall as far as Third Street.[33] The crowd estimates mentioned in many news outlets included "tens of thousands"[17] and "between 60,000 and 75,000",[1][2][34] while many sourced the Public Information Officer of the D.C. Fire Department who unofficially estimated there were "in excess of 75,000" people in attendance.[1][18][19][20] The D.C. Fire Department later released a statement that the crowd estimation attributed to them was false and based on an early estimation of a specific area, Freedom Plaza, not the number of participants in the event.[21]
Conservative bloggers, asserting estimates reported in the news as liberal media bias, estimated much higher attendance of between 1 and 2 million people at the event.[18][34][35] PolitiFact, The Christian Science Monitor, the Los Angeles Times, and other news outlets reported that some of these bloggers, such as Michelle Malkin, had originally distributed photos from a 1997 Promise Keepers march that made the 2009 march look more highly attended.[34][36][37] Adding difficulty to crowd estimation, a section of the National Mall near the Washington Monument was dedicated to the 24th annual National Black Family Reunion on September 12.[28]
Protesters walking down Pennsylvania Avenue
Matt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks, the organizer of the event, stated on stage that ABC News had reported 1 million to 1.5 million protesters in attendance. ABC News later published an article saying that they were misquoted by Kibbe, and went on to report that 60,000 to 70,000 had attended the event, citing the unofficial D.C. Fire Department number.[20] After comparing photographs of Saturday's protest with previous events, FreedomWorks revised their crowd estimate to be between 600,000 and 800,000.[18][38] Pete Sepp, a spokesman for the National Taxpayers Union, one of the organizations that sponsored the march, said the group estimated the crowd at 75,000 in the morning and from 200,000 and 300,000 as the day went on.[18]
Farouk El-Baz, a Boston University research professor and expert on crowd estimation, told the LA Times that his informal research from media coverage indicated 75,000 as the peak attendance. El-Baz noted that, because there seemed to be no aerial photos of the event, reaching any sort of rigorous estimate might be impossible. The Washington Metro reported 87,000 extra riders that day as compared to the average ridership.[18]
2010 March [ edit ]
Another march was held on September 12, 2010, in Washington, with, according to FOX News, a "thousands-strong" crowd.[39] Two other major tea parties were held in Sacramento, California, which attracted "thousands" and St. Louis, Missouri.[40]

The Solartab is unlike any charger on the market today. A truly unique product featuring great design, a powerful solar panel and a built-in cover that ensures maximum sun exposure at all times. Solartab: the solar charger you'll want to take with you everywhere you go!
Check out our video (above) to see what the Solartab looks like in action!
MEET THE SOLARTAB
Welcome, and thanks for taking a look at the Solartab – the powerful, portable and beautiful solar charger:
• A PREMIUM SOLAR CHARGER: The Solartab was born out of the idea of creating a high quality solar charger with attractive design and a truly efficient solar panel. Solar power should never be a mere gimmick – on the contrary, we believe it's the future of power consumption! A tablet-sized solar charger makes for a powerful and essential asset that truly liberates you from the power outlets of your home. Every day.
• UNIQUE COVER: We believe in smart design. Our unique cover does not only give the Solartab a stunning and nostalgic look, it also works as a stand for the solar panel. Using the stand, you can angle the panel in three different positions, allowing your phone or tablet to always charge as efficiently as possible. Find the right angle for maximum exposure to sunlight, plug in your device, and start charging! And even more, the cover will protect the Solartab while it's tucked away in your bag – always ready to join you wherever you're headed next.
• A POWERFUL ASSET - DAY AND NIGHT: Thanks to the Solartab's large solar panel you can always charge your device directly from the sun. Even while listening to your favorite summer tune or browsing the Internet at the same time. But we also equipped the Solartab with a high capacity internal in battery, so you can even store solar power – and give your tablet another full charge after sunset. Just whip it out during the day, not matter where you are, and you've always got power stored for when you really need it!
• PUT THE POWER INTO YOUR OWN HANDS: With two USB ports and a micro USB port, the Solartab is ready to keep any your mobile devices going at all times. And instead of simply leeching energy out of your home's power outlets, your devices will become truly independent units – taking advantage of the free and green energy that the sun provides right outside of your doorstep. An environmentally friendly, portable and never-ending source of energy, always ready for use: The Solartab is the perfect companion to your favorite gadgets!
Here are a few situations where you can use the Solartab:
• The park
• The beach
• On a rooftop
• Your favorite café
• Music festivals
• When hiking
• On a boat
• A clearance in the middle of the forest
• At picnics
• On savannahs or the outback
• In your backyard with some brews
• On a desert island
• At outdoor parties
• On the Great Wall of China
• In your grandma's orchard
WHERE DESIGN MEETS CONVENIENCE
The Solartab started out with a basic idea: How can we create a powerful and environmentally friendly charger that people want to use all the time? To us, it was important to create a product that people would embrace as one of their favorite belongings. And add to their their list of essentials that they always take with them, every time they leave home.
Drawing from our previous experience with solar panels, professionally and as consumers, we knew that we wanted a bigger solar panel. Something that could truly charge your devices efficiently. Too many solar chargers on the market today feature solar panels that simply are too small – barely strong enough to charge an iPhone within a reasonable amount of time. We wanted to create a solar charger strong enough to effectively charge even devices like the iPad. A charger that would allow its user to be mobile everywhere, anytime.
So we increased the size and the quality of the solar panel, way above what you'll find on the average charger on the market today. And already after our quick initial research and drafts we found that we could still create a slim, light and perfectly portable product. A product that would still be the size of a magazine. And weigh the same.
We couldn't find a solar charger on the market that did everything we wanted, so we decided to design one. And after a lot of work, we're ready to make our dream product a reality: A charger more powerful, reliable, good looking and portable than anything out there! After all, why should solar power be an inconvenient gimmick? We believe solar power should rather be a fully integrated part of your daily life.
We wanted to create a solar charger featuring beautiful and smart design. A robust aluminium frame encloses the Solartab's highly efficient solar panel, giving the product its clean, minimalist look. The cover is made out of soft, high grade polyurethane, which is both durable and water resistant – so don't worry about placing it on wet grass. An elegant elastic band and strong magnets hold the cover firmly closed, while adding to the Solartab's irresistable and timeless notebook look. And make sure it will stay closed and safe when you put it in your bag. Simply clever Scandinavian design.
But there is more. Since solar panels can only fully release their potential when sunlight hits them as directly as possible, we designed the cover to also serve as a stand, which always ensures maximum efficiency. Thanks to the stand's three different positions, the Solartab's solar panel can always be adjusted to the current position of the sun.
On top of that we have equipped the Solartab with a powerful internal battery. This means you can charge your devices even after the sun has set! As long as you let it soak up sun during the day until it's full, the internal battery will always be able to provide a full charge on an iPad – and more. With the Solartab, you've always got complete independence in all your charging needs!
Through our long and thorough product development process, we constantly strived to design a product that would truly change the way you perceive and use solar chargers. Through our uncompromising and perfectionist approach, all the way from early sketches to physical prototypes to the final product, we believe we have made the Solartab the best portable solar charger there is. It combines efficient solar charging with an attractive and smart design. The result is a truly unique product that will become your trusted everyday companion. Power everywhere!
JOIN US: TAKE ENERGY INTO YOUR OWN HANDS, AND BRING IT WITH YOU EVERYWHERE
For urban people enjoying an active, modern and versatile lifestyle, having constant access to phones and tablets is nothing less than essential. And as technology to an ever greater degree leaves the comfort and the power outlets of one's home, the demand for alternate power sources increases.
Our generation is also an environmentally conscious one. We bear great responsibility upon our shoulders: As it becomes ever more clear how unsustainable the power consumption of previous generations has been, we are constantly on the lookout for more environmentally friendly solutions to our ever increasing energy needs. Using solar power to an increasing degree is exactly the direction we should be heading.
By the end of the day, it is up to us individuals to change the world. And the fact is, we're currently in the middle of a revolution that empowers the individual in many different fields – slowly weakening what previously used to be the rock-hard centres of power, one step at a time.
"Energy has traditionally been generated centrally, distributed over power lines and sold to consumers. (…)The Edison Electric Institute (EEI), a trade group, warns that distributed generation could do to energy companies what the internet did to newspapers." - The Economist on solar power, March 8th, 2014
We're living in an exciting age. Since fairly recently, the computer and the internet have made it possible for anyone to record music or videos, or write books, and distribute them on their own. Right from their personal tablet or laptop computer, and out to the whole wide world. We are in no way as dependent on the big record companies, movie studios publishing houses as we were just a few years ago.
In the same way, the influx of 3D printers is bound to shift production of all kinds of goods from giant factories to the comfort of our homes. And the solar power revolution will take ever more power from the big energy companies, and give each individual the ability to take advantage of the sun fuelled energy present right outside his or her doorstep. Free yourself from the power outlets of your home, and let the Solartab follow you and your smartphone or tablet everywhere – never running out of energy. It's green, it's free, and it gives us the freedom we require.

WE NEED YOUR HELP!
We've already come a long way with the Solartab, but need your help to make this project become a reality! We still need to:
- Buy the injection moulds (to get the beautiful polyurethane cover to look perfect we need to get very expensive moulds made).
- Work with our manufacturer to design an IC that is suitable for mass production and will pass standard testing. (Luckily our manufacturer has a lot of experience with this!)
- Get the Package Designed. (We want the box the Solartab comes in to be as beautiful as the product itself!)
- Get enough volume to make the Solartab a reality. (Any factory will have a minimum volume that needs to be met)
We have an excellent relationship with our manufacturer and will be on the ground in China during the entire manufacturing process. Our manufacturer can work with a very short lead-time and we have a great sourcing capability for solar cells. We are therefore confident that we can deliver the Solartab by July!
Crews setup the stage for the “An Undefeated Conversation: Athletes, Responsibility, and Violence” at the South Side YMCA on August 24, 2016 in Chicago, Ill. The conversation is taking place on August 25, 2016 and is being shown on ESPN.
Philando Castile. Alton Sterling. The Dallas and Baton Rouge police officers: A summer of horrific gun violence that continues daily from Orlando to Milwaukee is prompting athletes and activists across the country to ask themselves what can be done. This week, The Undefeated looks at some of the issues involved and holds a town hall discussion in Chicago, the site of some of the nation's worst gun violence.
UPDATED – On Thursday, The Undefeated will host a special town hall meeting that will focus on athletes, guns, violence and law enforcement. An Undefeated Conversation: Athletes, Responsibility, and Violence will be held at the South Side YMCA of Metro Chicago and hosted by Jemele Hill of ESPN's His & Hers.
The 90-minute program will air at 9:30 p.m. EST and cover an array of topics, including athletes' personal experience with racial profiling, whether sports leagues and teams have an obligation to support athletes' activism, and athletes and gun ownership. One panel will examine how athletes can use their platforms to make a difference. The discussions can be followed on social media by using the hashtag #UndefeatedConvo.
Among the panelists scheduled to participate are Chicago Bulls point guard Rajon Rondo, NBA Hall of Famer and Chicago native Isiah Thomas, SportsNation co-host Marcellus Wiley, Chicago White Sox executive vice president Kenny Williams, University of Illinois at Chicago historian Elizabeth Todd-Breland, ESPN commentator Michael Wilbon and Chicago-based Baptist pastor Jolinda Wade, mother of NBA star Dwyane Wade, former MLB player Doug Glanville, Milwaukee Bucks forward Jabari Parker and Stephanie Brown, a Chicago mother whose son was killed while playing basketball.
At 9 p.m. EST, a 30-minute radio show hosted by The Undefeated's Clinton Yates and ESPN 1000's Jonathan Hood will air ahead of the town hall meeting. A one-hour, post-town hall meeting radio show with Yates and Hood will air nationally at 11 p.m. EST.
The nation's problems with gun violence are particularly acute in Chicago, which has had 2,703 shootings so far this year, including 449 homicides.
Many athletes are beginning to speak out against the gun violence and ways to combat it. The Undefeated's editor-in-chief Kevin Merida said he hopes the town hall will help continue a dialogue that will create changes within communities.
“Sports are great bridge-builders in our country, bringing together people who think differently and live differently,” Merida said. “Athletes, in greater numbers, have been saying they want to use their influence to drive social change. We hope this town hall will help push that conversation forward.”

Eddie Hearn said he might bid for the mega fight between Wladimir Klitschko and Tyson Fury if it goes to purse bids next Monday Eddie Hearn said he might bid for the mega fight between Wladimir Klitschko and Tyson Fury if it goes to purse bids next Monday
Matchroom promoter Eddie Hearn has hinted he may make a purse bid for Wladimir Klitschko v Tyson Fury.
The 39-year-old Klitschko (64-3-0-KO53) currently holds the WBA, WBO and IBF world titles but with the deadline for agreeing terms with mandatory WBO challenger Fury on Monday, Hearn has confirmed he is considering travelling to Panama for the resulting purse bidding.
Hearn told Sky Sports: "It's a big fight for the world heavyweight title involving a Briton and a great champion in Wladimir Klitschko. There is a purse bid in Panama and maybe we'll be on the plane to put a bid in ourselves.
"When a fight is made for a mandatory defence, and Tyson Fury is that mandatory challenger, you get a period of time when the two parties' promotional teams can privately negotiate terms. Once that period is up, if terms haven't been agreed, it goes to a purse bid.
It's a big fight for the world heavyweight title involving a Briton and a great champion in Wladimir Klitschko. Eddie Hearn
"When you're not really aligned with a broadcaster - someone like a Tyson Fury - you can sit back and let it go to purse bids and see who wants to pay the most money. It's quite a unique situation and everybody will turn up with an envelope and the governing body will read out the bids. Whoever pays the most, gets the fight.
"Germany isn't our market so we'd be looking to stage that fight in the UK. It's a big fight but they could agree terms by Monday. This is the time with a few days to go that the pressure is really on. If they don't agree terms, then I'm sure there will be some interesting bidders.
"We'd look at September or October time. The deadline for that fight is October 24. Obviously Fury is from Manchester. It's a great O2 Arena fight as well. There's been plenty of talking about it happening outdoors.
"Of course I've thought about bidding. We'll have the paperwork ready to go but probably until Monday morning, we won't think that the bidding is going to go ahead because like I said, this deal can be done at any time. If the purse bids go ahead, I'm sure we'll be there.
Tyson Fury is a quality young fighter but he hasn't been in with the quality of Klitschko. People struggle with Klitschko's size but Fury has size advantage over Klitschko. Eddie Hearn
"Tyson Fury is a quality young fighter but he hasn't been in with the quality of Klitschko. People struggle with Klitschko's size but Fury has size advantage over Klitschko and is very unorthodox. He's also unusual in his approach and tactics - Peter Fury is a very bright man. He's got a chance in the fight.
"I hope Fury wins. That would open the door for huge fights in the division with Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder so I'd love to see him do it. On paper, I don't think he does but I rate him and I certainly think he has a shot in the fight."
On the future of British heavyweight knockout artist Joshua, who has accounted for all 13 of his professional opponents to date inside three rounds or fewer, Hearn added: "I'd like to see Joshua challenge for the world heavyweight title in the next 12 months.
"Probably this time next year we'll see him involved in, if not world title fights, fringe 'elite' fights. He's got people to deal with domestically and you've got to understand that he wants to go through everybody."
Novel drug beats severe malaria
WALTER AND ELIZA HALL INSTITUTE OF MEDICAL RESEARCH 24 MAY 2012

A novel anti-inflammatory drug could help to improve survival in the most severe cases of malaria by preventing the immune system from causing irrevocable brain and tissue damage.
Walter and Eliza Hall Institute researchers have shown that a new class of anti-inflammatory agents, called IDR (innate defense regulator) peptides, could help to increase survival from severe clinical malaria when used in combination with antimalarial drugs.
A research team fronted by Dr Ariel Achtman and Dr Sandra Pilat-Carotta, and led by Professor Louis Schofield from the institute's Infection and Immunity division, published the study today in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Dr Achtman said that many drugs that prevent malaria infections are not effective in sick patients at preventing tissue damage that arises from the inflammatory immune response. “The most severe forms of malaria, such as cerebral malaria which causes brain damage, are actually the result of the immune system trying to fight infection and causing collateral damage,” she said.
Dr Pilat-Carotta said the team used a treatment approach combining drugs that suppress potentially harmful inflammation with antimalarial agents that fight the parasite, in mouse models infected with the malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei. “In this study, we showed that a new class of drugs could prevent inflammation in the brains of mice with malaria and improve their survival. This is an example of a ‘host-directed' therapy – a treatment intended to act on the host not the parasite,” Dr Pilat-Carotta said.
Malaria kills up to one million people worldwide every year, particularly children under five and pregnant women, who often develop severe clinical symptoms such as brain damage and multiple organ failure.
Professor Schofield said up to 25 per cent of severe clinical malaria cases are fatal even with access to the best health care. “Antimalarial drugs are very effective, but only if they are given before serious clinical symptoms develop. On their own, antimalarial drugs fail in approximately one out of every four cases of severe clinical malaria, because by the time the patient arrives at a hospital they are already very sick and inflammation caused by the immune response to the parasite is causing major organ damage,” Professor Schofield said.
IDR peptides are a new class of anti-inflammatory agent developed by Professor Robert Hancock and colleagues at the University of British Columbia, Canada, which enhance beneficial aspects of the initial immune response, while dampening harmful inflammation, Professor Schofield said. “IDR peptides are also relatively cheap to produce and easy to use, making them a good option for medical treatments in developing countries,” he said.
Dr Achtman said the development of preclinical models of severe malaria could improve pre-clinical drug screening and potentially prevent some of the drug failures that happen at the human clinical trial stage. “Professor Gordon Smyth and Ms Charity Law from the institute's Bioinformatics division used sophisticated bioinformatics-driven analyses to identify early changes to inflammatory processes, days before the mice show visible changes in malaria disease symptoms. Host-directed therapies are a good treatment option because parasites are less likely to evolve resistance, and we believe they will eventually increase the number of successful treatment interventions in the short time window between hospitalisation with severe malaria and death,” Dr Achtman said.
The research was supported by the Grand Challenges in Global Health Research program through the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health and Canadian Institutes of Health Research, National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, and the Victorian Government.
Oxi Day has totemic significance in Greece . It commemorates the defiant Greek “No” to Mussolini's ultimatum in October 1940, and the heroic acceptance of war against a vastly bigger military machine.
It is the same word that will top the ballot sheet when Greeks vote in a snap referendum this Sunday on creditor demands, and prime minister Alexis Tsipras is not shy in evoking the same spirit of wartime resistance.
His speech to the nation on Wednesday night was peppered with talk of ultimata. He accused “extreme Right-wing circles” of forcing the closure of the Greek banks and the imposition of capital controls through liquidity asphyxiation.
He lashed out at “authoritarians” in charge of the IMF and EU institutions. He spoke of attempts to blackmail the Greek people. And he vowed to campaign against the creditor package - which, strictly speaking, is no longer on offer - deeming it the “destruction of Europe”.
Where this will take him, and take Greece, is anybody's guess. The latest Efimerida ton Syntakton poll shows the “No” side leading by 54pc against 33pc for “yes”. But that lead - if it really exists - may evaporate as the ghastly consequences of financial collapse become clearer by the day.
Distraught pensioners have been gathering in small, tense crowds outside banks trying to withdraw their weekly allowance of €120 (£85). Many have not been paid. A throng of veterans protested outside the finance ministry on Wednesday morning, denouncing EU “dictatorship” and Mr Tsipras with equal fury.
Alexis Tsipras addresses the Greek nation on Wednesday
Ambulances in parts of northern Greece have run out of fuel. The Greek Chamber of Commerce warns of “serious shortages” of basic goods and pharmaceutical supplies within days. The radical-Left Syriza government is skating on very thin ice.
If Europe's creditor powers have succeeded in bringing Greece to its knees, they have paid a fearful price themselves. As Pyrrhus said after the battle of Asculum: “Another such victory, and we will be utterly ruined.”
We can already see that the EU itself has suffered a reputational catastrophe on several fronts. This is of far greater importance in the sweep of events than daily twists and turns in Athens.
It has brought about a state of affairs where a member of its own eurozone family has become the first developed country in history to default to the IMF.
Let us be clear what this means. The currency union itself is delinquent. The rich countries of northern Europe are refusing to pay African, Asian and Latin American states. Blaming it on Greece alone does not wash.
The eurozone has shown itself unable to manage its basic moral responsibilities. Russian president Vladimir Putin could hardly resist his own wicked dig, professing “great concern” over the EU's vanishing credibility.
Customers queue to withdraw cash from ATMs in Thessaloniki
This default is doubly shameful given that the original IMF-Troika loan in 2010 was not intended to save Greece. The extra debt was imposed on an already bankrupt Greek state to buy time for the euro, against Greek interests.
Leaked documents leave no doubt that the real purpose was to save monetary union and the European banking system - and to avert a “Euro-Lehman”, in the IMF's own words - at a time when the eurozone had no defences against contagion.
Worse, the bitter showdown has made brutally explicit what many long suspected, that sovereign democracies count for nought when push comes to shove in Euroland.
The European Central Bank is not the chief villain, perhaps, in the latest chapter. It is in an impossible position. Yet citizens across Europe can see with their own eyes that the ECB has been rationing emergency liquidity (ELA) for a prostrate country as a tool of political pressure, and that it forced Syriza to take the drastic step of shutting the banks by freezing ELA at €89bn.
It is an odd spectacle to watch a central bank with a treaty duty to uphold financial stability take the deliberate decision to precipitate the collapse of banks that it regulates. But the deeper point is that the insane construction of the euro - a naked currency union without fiscal and political foundations - must inevitably tend to authoritarian monetary dystopia in the end.
It is, however, too soon to conclude that Syriza will buckle to creditor demands. It is certainly hard to read the real intentions of Mr Tsipras. His defiant stand on Wednesday night is starkly at odds with the letter he sent to EMU officials earlier in the day and the IMF on Tuesday that seemed, at first blush, to make big concessions. But nothing is ever what it seems in this weird drama.
“Those who say we have a secret plan for Greece to exit euro are lying,” he swore, with an impressively straight face. He denied that a “No” vote implies Grexit - though the leaders of France, Germany and Italy say it means exactly that - knowing that few Greeks are yet willing to take such a drastic step.
Yet one might suspect - and I have not made up my mind - that he and Syriza's inner circle concluded in April that they could not do business with an EMU regime that acts solely as the enforcement arm of the creditors.
They may have concluded that demands for further fiscal contraction were economic lunacy - a view shared by the Nobel fraternity and the US Treasury - and that no serious debt relief was on the table, and therefore they would do better to default and restore a Greek sovereign currency.
If so, they cannot admit it. They must make it appear that the decision was forced upon them, just as France's Leon Blum had to tell white lies to free his country from the Gold Standard in 1936.
Syriza officials are fully aware that the likely consequence of a “No” vote would be a parallel currency - or IOUs - along with the nationalisation of the banks along the lines of the “Icelandic Model”. Syriza's Left Platform has already drawn up plans along these lines. Variants almost certainly exist in the Greek finance ministry.
Such action implies a return to the drachma in short order. The Greeks would continue to insist that the country remains a member of the euro, with full legal rights - blaming the creditors and EU bodies for acting illegally. Only by doing so could they ensure that the full losses from Grexit fall on the ECB and the EMU bail-out funds, while the assets of Greek citizens remain legally protected in foreign accounts, free to return later to rebuild a new banking system.
If you were of a suspicious mind, you might wonder whether Mr Tsipras has not in fact lured European leaders and officials into a legal trap, and that they have fallen for the bait.
His Byzantine negotiating tactics may make perfect sense after all. Just a thought.
It's very easy for a Phillies fan to hate Chipper Jones. After all, over the course of his 19 year professional baseball career with the Atlanta Braves, he has absolutely murdered the Phillies. In his 969 plate appearances against the Phillies, his triple slash line is .332/.444/.598, good for an amazing 1.042 OPS. For Chipper's entire career, that's his highest OPS against an NL team (faring better against only two AL teams - a 1.239 OPS+ against the Rays (in 93 plate appearances) and a 1.369 OPS+ against the Twins (28 plate appearances)).
As if that isn't enough, his public persona is one that is despicable. We've chronicled and lambasted it enough throughout the years here on The Good Phight - his adultery, his forever being linked with a wife beater, his throwing teammates under a bus, his whining about injuries, his whining about umpires, his constant injuries, his naming his daughter something absurd, his looking like someone who enjoys the Tomahawk Chop too much, and his being a 40 year old man who still calls himself Chipper.
He's a loathsome public individual. We know that already. Everyone knows that.
But in his final year, maybe it's time to take a step back and appreciate Chipper Jones in a way that we haven't before. Sometimes, you just have to be a better human being than you normally are, and today, I'll try. So below you'll find my take on appreciating Larry "Chipper" Jones:
Hustle: Chipper Jones hustles, and we rarely appreciate it. Probably the most momentous display of his hustle came in December 2008. Chipper had spent a Saturday afternoon with his daughter Shea and was heading to Bobby Cox's house, where Chipper was going to leave Shea for the evening. Chipper looked at his watch, saw that it was 7:25, did some quick math, and realized that if he didn't hustle, he would miss his 7:45 reservations. He drove just a bit quicker, sprinted up the driveway at the Cox residence, left Shea with "Uncle Bobby" without giving her a kiss goodbye, and made it to Hooters with a minute to spare. That's hustle!
The Little Things: During flights to away games, on off-days, and during the off-season, Chipper Jones has long dabbled in the world of nano-technology. Nano-technology is the manipulation of matter at the molecular level. This amazing field of science has broad applications in medicine, electronics, energy, computing, and a host of other fields. Chipper's gifts, both mental and physical, combine to make him a perfect nano-scientist. His rare fine motor skills combined with an IQ that has been measured in the 170 range has lead to surprising developments in the field. His creative thinking will also impact society in the future. After all, the idea to use nanotechnology to build the fabled space elevator? All Chipper's.
Plays the Game Right: Chipper Jones is a master chess player. While not quite the level of a Bobby Fischer or Garry Kasparov, Chipper regularly advances deep into international competitions. When looking back on his chess playing days, Chipper points to his great accomplishments, such as being the first professional athlete to master the art of casting, playing and winning against twenty 8 year olds simultaneously, and even once beating Deep Blue. When asked why Chipper is so successful at chess, an internationally acclaimed coach (who did not want to be identified) responded, "he plays the game the right way."
Grit: When he's too injured to play baseball, Chipper Jones delivers meals to the hungriest of the hungry. He regularly boards planes to the poorest countries of the world and seeks out the slums facing the most devastating forms of hunger. In those areas, he finds the weakest individuals, those struggling with food shortages in ways we could never comprehend. Chipper actually delivers the meals to these individuals himself. He's not afraid to roll up his sleeves and get his hands dirty, all for the sake of his fellow human beings. If he comes home with dirt and scratches on his face from all of his hard work and long hours, he is known to tell his teammates "this is the price you pay for feeding the hungry and helping advance good in the world." His teammates, knowing only the language of baseball, look at him in awe and utter in unison: "That's grit."
Determination: Ever concerned about the quality of umpiring in the majors as well as the lack of commitment from younger players who refuse to play through injuries, Chipper Jones was determined to make a difference. Just this off-season, after battling through the bureaucracy of the players' and umpires' union, he prevailed and created the Chipper Jones Institute for Quality Umpiring and Injury Ignoring. When no one initially signed up to participate in the inaugural season of the Institute, Chipper personally stalked 18 umpires and 53 major leaguers, using text messaging, Facebook, Twitter, and personal visits at their favorite strip clubs to get their attention. He ultimately convinced them all to attend the Institute, where he himself lectured them for 10 days straight (10 hours per day) about the right way to call a game and play through injuries.
Always Gives 110%: Chipper Jones has never taken home a penny of the money he earns from baseball. In fact, he doesn't just donate 100% of his salary to charity - he donates 110% of it. In a famous quote from a 2007 biographical mini-series about Chipper's life that aired on the History Channel, he stated: "Why should I be blessed with the luxuries of the modern world when others suffer so deeply? Sure, I could give just 100% of my salary to charity, but would that really be doing enough? As ballplayers, we are trained to give 110%, so that's what I do."
Class: There is nothing of greater importance to the good folks of Atlanta, Georgia and the fans of the Atlanta Braves than class. And Chipper Jones has never missed a class for anything. Growing up in Florida, Chipper Jones was famous for attending every single class from pre-school through 12th grade. When he entered the amateur draft as a senior in 1990, it was a tough decision, as he realized it would take away from him going to college and attending even more class. But life as a professional ballplayer gave him opportunities to attend class still. At newbie class, both for the MLB and the Braves, Chipper showed up on time and never missed a day. When rehabbing all of his injuries, he never missed a rehab session. Why? Because he treated it like class. He loves class so much, in retirement he's looking forward to getting his college degree, a masters, a Ph.D., and several post-doctoral degrees as well . . . all so he can attend more classes.
It's clear all of the Chipper Jones haters have been wrong, very wrong. The man is great, and we have ignored his greatness for too long. I'm glad I've finally, in the last year we'll have to face him as a Brave, set the world straight on this point.

“The centerpiece of Malcolm's political project was to internationalise the condition of Black peoples in the United States.” Sohail Daulatzai, Black Star, Crescent Moon: The Muslim International and Black Freedom beyond America, p.36
This February marks the fiftieth anniversary of the public assassination of Malcolm X. In the shadow of the nationwide revolt against endemic police violence, economic exploitation and social alienation the embryo of a new movement led by youth of color is upon us under the banner #Black Lives Matter. Gone for fifty years, Malcolm remains a towering figure in the pantheon of the 20th century revolutionaries that sought to end systems of oppression and degradation. This generation is engaged in a struggle to define and preserve their humanity in the face of cold-blooded indifference to their suffering under capitalism and racism. Let's examine the final 11 months of Malcolm's life and legacy.
1964-The Evolution of a Revolutionary
On March 8, 1964 following a ninety day exile turned to an indefinite suspension from the Nation of Islam (NOI) following his “chickens come home to roost” statement following the death of John F. Kennedy in November 1963. Malcolm X decided to make an announcement that he was leaving the NOI and spiritual teacher Elijah Muhammad to fully engage in the struggle for civil and human rights at home and abroad. Malcolm would form Muslim Mosque Inc for NOI members who followed him to continue to practice of black American based Islam and in June developing the political arm that would allow him to fully participate in the civil rights movement; The Organization of Afro-American Unity on the model of The Organization of African Unity following the aftermath of the victories of the anti-colonial liberation struggles in the neo-colonial world.
The development of Islam in the U.S. dates back to the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the growth of Islam during slavery, the rise of black nationalism in mid-1800s, the teachings of Edward Wilmot Blyden, the father of Pan-Africanism, as well as black urban Islamist sects like the Noble Drew Ali's Moorish Science Temple of America. The Marcus Garvey movement and his Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), had been the largest black-led movement in which Malcolm's parents were active members. In the early 20th century, the Garvey movement along with socialist and anarchist were crushed under the federal government's Palmer raids, with the involvement of the young agent, notorious and future director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover. The Garvey movement comprised of cultural nationalism and black capitalism. Many former Graveyites became attracted to the Lost-Found Nation of Islam under the leadership of W.D. Fard and eventually, Elijah Poole, who would later become Elijah Muhammad.
Rise of the Nation of Islam
The Nation of Islam spoke out against the hypocrisy of American democracy, capitalism, white supremacy, and the horrid conditions faced by black people since slavery. Drawing their membership from the urban black working class, poor, prison population and semi-employed, NOI preached and practiced a combination of cultural black nationalism and pro-capitalist ideals. NOI was a top-down leadership, including a paramilitary wing (The Fruit of Islam). Theologically, NOI preached that black people are the “chosen people” to be delivered from the evil of white supremacy and Jim Crow and a global connection with people of color in Asia, Africa, Middle East and Latin America.
The NOI distinct form of black American based Islam was not recognized by mainstream Sunni Islam. The NOI had a non-engagement policy concerning the most important social movement of the time, the civil rights movement. NOI and Elijah Muhammad feared a government attack on the organization, Elijah Muhammad was arrested in 1934 when he refused to transfer his children from the movement's school, the University of Islam, to a public school. Tried in Detroit, he was found guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and placed on six months' probation. As the earth-shaking events were taking place globally with revolutions, counter-revolutions, rebellions and civil rights at home, Malcolm's political and spiritual stirrings for a fuller engagement in the struggle was palpable. As the national spokesman of the NOI, Malcolm was politicizing the theology of Elijah Muhammad to the dismay and anger of the leadership of the NOI.
After splitting from the NOI, In April 1964 Malcolm began what would be two expansive trips internationally to Africa, Middle East and Europe. It had religious and political objectives, as Malcolm sought to complete the Hajj to Mecca and formally accept the teachings of Sunni Islam. Malcolm aimed to become a point of reference in the United States for Islam theologically and organizationally. Malcolm's trips throughout the Middle East and Africa had a huge effect on his thinking on Islam. Malcolm believed spiritually and politically Islam could play a role in the liberation struggle against racism and white supremacy. Malcolm exclaims, “Our success in America will involve two circles, black nationalism and Islam… And Islam will link us spiritually to Africa, Arabia and Asia,” (Manning Marabel, Malcolm X, A Life of Reinvention, p.311-312.)
Linking Black Freedom struggle with anti-colonialism
Politically, Malcolm aimed to bring the case of twenty-two million Afro-Americans who faced Jim Crow America of poverty, police violence and political disenfranchisement to a world stage like the work of Paul Robeson, Max Yergan, Alphaeus Hunton, Dr. W.E. B Dubois and countless others with trailblazing organizations like the Council of Africa Affairs (CAA) in the 1940s and early 50s.
Malcolm had to navigate through a world situation after World War II that witnessed a period of revolution and counter revolution. The revolutions in the colonial world like in China, Algeria, Vietnam, Cuba and the non-aligned movement that produced the influential Bandung Conference of 1955 had a profound effect on Malcolm's political worldview. The anti-colonial revolutions punctuated the decline of European colonial power at home and abroad, the emergence of the United States as the preeminent capitalist super-power and strengthening of social democracy and Stalinism in Eastern Europe provided the backdrop to Malcom's evolving ideas over the span of 11 months. At home, the black freedom movement under the phase of the civil rights movement beginning in 1955 following the brutal murder of Emmitt Till and Rosie Parks defiant refusal to get up from a Montgomery bus seat, ignited a powerful social movement against slavery by another name, Jim Crow.
President Harry Truman's anti-communism Doctrine of 1947, senator Joe McCarthy witch hunts and Cold War liberalism at home and abroad had a devastating effect on the radical black freedom movement its leading left activists and radical leaders. As professor Penny M. Von Eschen writes in Race Against Empire: Black Americans and Anti-colonialism, 1937-1957, “The embrace of Cold War American foreign policy by many African American liberals as well as U.S. government prosecution of activists such as Robeson and the CAA, fundamentally altered the terms of anti-colonialism and effectively severed the black American struggle for civil rights from the issues of anti-colonialism and racism abroad.” (p.3)
Civil rights movement develops
The rise of a reformist, liberal and church based leadership under organizations like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Southern Christian Leadership Council (SCLC) would lead the civil rights movement with its non-violent civil disobedience tactics and struggle for political and social reforms from US big business and its two parties (Democrats and Republicans) during the post-WWII economic upswing became to dominate force in the freedom struggle. Due to militant social struggle by the movement, the liberal political and economic elite believed that capitalism could address poverty, racism and endemic oppression, Lyndon B. Johnson's administration was forced to implement key social programs under the War on Poverty program and passage of the Civil Rights Act 1964 and Voting Rights 1965.
The work of Malcolm in this key year was a continuum of his third world analysis that developed during his time with NOI that dates back to the late 50s, epitomized by Malcolm's meeting with Fidel Castro in Harlem in 1960. Malcolm highlighted the limitations of liberalism under Johnson which would become evident after the full involvement of the US imperialism in Vietnam economically and militarily, the role of the two-party system, particularly the Democratic Party as a dead-end and its co-option of all social movements. He highlighted entrenched white supremacy and also American democracy's hypocrisy in the face of the social explosions that gripped a number of cities like Harlem, violent repression of civil rights workers like the murder of James Earl Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael “Mickey” Schwerner in July.
Malcolm sought to re-tie the threads of the struggle in the US for civil rights to an internationalist framework, anti-capitalists, anti-imperialist, uniting the most oppressed and youth in the third world and US, and total liberation from the power structure of daily oppression and exploitation. His campaign to take the US to the United Nations and charge it with crimes against Afro-Americans human rights was crucial to place the struggle on a world stage echoing the work of Roberson Dubious and William Paterson “We Charge Genocide” petition in 1951 to be presented to the U.N. The international ruling elite, U.S. governmental forces and NOI members wanted Malcolm dead because of his potential to organize, inspire and provide an alternative to racism and capitalism.
The Meaning of Malcolm X Today
At the end of his life Malcolm draw a deeper analysis of capitalism and white supremacy providing a blueprint for black power activist, organizations and generations to follow. Malcolm matters because the conditions that produced Malcolm still exist. The abject poverty, racism, high rates of unemployment, mass prison incarceration, police violence, layoffs and massive budget cuts, are a byproduct of a sick capitalist system based on delivering super profits for a small global ruling elite. These conditions are producing a new generation of revolutionaries who will be inspired by the shining example of Malcolm X like the youth in Ferguson and nationwide.
Anthony Scaramucci, the 10-day White House communications director, reportedly threatened legal action in an email to a student who wrote a critical op-ed about the hedge-funder for his school paper.
Tufts University postponed a Monday event with alumnus Scaramucci after “he threatened to sue a student and the school newspaper for defamation following the publication of an op-ed column criticizing him,” the Boston Globe reported.
According to the Globe, Scaramucci's lawyer sent a letter to graduate student Camilo A. Caballero and The Tufts Daily newspaper demanding a retraction of “false and defamatory allegations of fact” allegedly contained in an op-ed written by Caballero — as well as an apology.
“In an e-mail to Caballero, Scaramucci said the student had ‘suggested publicly' that Scaramucci had engaged in unethical behavior,” the Globe also reported.
“So either back it up or you will hear from my lawyer,” Scaramucci wrote on Nov. 16. “You may have a difference of opinion from me politically which I respect but you can't make spurious claims about my reputation and integrity.”
In Caballero's op-ed, published November 6, the student slammed Scaramucci and called into question his position on an advisory board at Tufts' Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.
“A man who is irresponsible, inconsistent, an unethical opportunist and who exuded the highest degree of disreputability should not be on the Fletcher Board,” Caballero wrote of the Mooch. “Scaramucci has, in his career and actions, demonstrated nothing that would align his values with those of the Fletcher School. His presence on the board instead places the credibility of Fletcher at risk.”
Scaramucci confirmed that he asked for an apology for the op-ed in a series of tweets responding to his critics:
I asked for an apology for defamatory statements. That is a teachable moment professor. The student is an adult, let his actions stand without any coddling. You can't defame people in America because you don't like their political views. https://t.co/q5fi8wszqn — Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) November 27, 2017

Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com
FINLAND'S vast forests are not as healthy as a casual observer might believe. A comprehensive survey of threatened species has determined forests are the habitat of the greatest number of at-risk species.
The Finnish Environment Institute SYKE has estimated that Finland is home to 2,247 threatened species. Forests are the habitat with the largest number, 814, followed by agricultural environments with 401 and shorelines with 290. The Baltic Sea, which is often in the news for environmental problems, is home to only 17 threatened species.
Endangered forests
In the report, Pertti Rassi, Esko Hyvärinen, Aino Juslén and Ilpo Mannerkoski say there are several distinct reasons why forest species are at risk.
“In the current evaluation, causes of threat related to forests are divided into five groups: forest management activities, changes in the tree species composition, reduction of old-growth forests, decreasing amounts of decaying wood and reduction of burnt forest areas.”
Selected species at risk • The flower Viola collina, often known as a violet, is listed as Vulnerable. • The mountain hare is classified as Near Threatened. • The famous Saimaa ringed seal is Critically Endangered. • The lesser white-fronted goose is Critically Endangered. • The wolf is Endangered. Regionally Extinct species • 332 species are classified as Regionally Extinct in Finland. • 59 species' extinction is blamed on changes in the forest environment. • 50 species went extinct due to the overgrowth of open habitats, such as meadows. • 42 species have chemical disturbances such as eutrophication as a primary or secondary cause for extinction. • Climate change has caused only one extinction, Arctoa hyperborea, a type of moss.
Finland is the most forested nation in Europe. Over 70 per cent of Finland's land area is covered by forest, which equates to about 230,000 square kilometres. Yet it is not in the best of health.
“The amount of decaying wood has been found to be one of the most important factors affecting the diversity of forest species, and special attention has been paid to it recently,” the authors continue. “On average, Finnish forests contain 5.4 cubic metres per hectare of dead wood, which is very little in comparison to old-growth forests in their natural state, where the amount of decaying wood is 20-120 cubic metres per hectare.”
Perversely, the authors point out the attempt to use logging residue and stumps for biofuel, which was supposed to be good for the environment, is in fact decreasing the amount of decaying wood in trees and putting species at risk. The lack of decaying wood is particularly hard on species that depend upon it, such as fungi.
“One cannot be very optimistic about developments in the coming 10-year period. For example, it has not been possible to mitigate climate change substantially. New clouds are gathering in the sky. Finland plans to cover a larger proportion of its energy demand with wood in the future. In practice, this will mean that all logging residue will be collected from forests. The planned consumption of energy wood will decrease the amount of decaying wood in forests significantly and may cause drastic changes in our forest flora and fauna.”
Saimaa seal
While forests contain the largest number of threatened species, the rate of decline has slowed. Other habitats, particularly in mires, shores and rock outcrops, contain more at-risk species than previously thought. Some organisms in aquatic locales are also threatened.
The Saimaa ringed seal, the poster boy of Finnish endangered species, is continuing to experience difficulties. The seal showed slow but steady improvement until 2005, when the population began to decline. The State Forest Management agency Metsähallitus estimates only 300 individuals survive.
“The clearest reasons for this were mild winters, during which the proportion of pups found dead in their lairs increased from 8 per cent to 30 per cent, as well as drowning caused by fishing tackle,” the authors explain.

A week before Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan is set to leave New York for Rome, where his name is being floated as a candidate for pope, he was questioned in Manhattan for three hours on Wednesday behind closed doors in a legal deposition concerning the sexual abuse of children by priests.
The lawyers deposing Cardinal Dolan represent hundreds of people who say they were sexually molested by priests in the Archdiocese of Milwaukee, which he led for seven years before his appointment as archbishop of New York in 2009. The lawyers want to know when Cardinal Dolan, as archbishop of Milwaukee, learned of allegations against certain priests, and how quickly he made those allegations public.
Cardinal Dolan is one of two American cardinals who are being deposed in sexual abuse lawsuits this week, and who plan to travel to Rome next week in advance of the proceedings to elect the successor to Pope Benedict XVI, who announced last week that he was resigning Feb. 28.
The other American is Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, the retired archbishop of Los Angeles. He is expected to be deposed on Saturday in Los Angeles, and he has been under fire since the court-ordered release last month of 12,000 pages of internal church files revealing his role in shielding accused priests from the law.
Flying Saucer McDonald's
Roswell, New Mexico
This is the world's only McDonald's shaped like a flying saucer. Its aerodynamic qualities have been compromised by its need to enclose a Playland, but there's no mistaking its distinctive saucer shape, enhanced during daylight by its metal skin and at night by its judicious used of neon piping around its window frames and ridge lines.
The large wall of an adjacent building has been filled with a mural by resident Roswell guerilla artist Larry Welz. Ronald McDonald and Birdie the Early Bird fly space contraptions around what appears to be a planet-size brain. Is McDonald's -- which commissioned the art -- suggesting that it serves brain food? The mural gives people waiting at the drive-thru something to ponder, and provides a handy photo-op for Roswell's alien-minded fast-food-chomping visitors.
UPDATE July 23: Rising tensions between the U.S. and Russia can only help SpaceX's efforts to open bidding on Pentagon missions.
Editor's Note: The article was changed to point out that Boeing's Delta IV rocket uses the RS-68 engine manufactured by Aerojet Rocketdyne of Rancho Cordova, California. The RD-180 engine is used by Lockheed's Atlas V launch vehicle.
Original story begins here:
Citing “anomalies” in Space Exploration Technologies Corp.'s (SpaceX) flights, the U.S. Air Force has yet to certify the company for Pentagon contracts.
In a letter to Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) a member of the House Armed Services Committee, the Air Force said there were problems in three of SpaceX's missions: reignition failure in a second-stage rocket engine in September 2013, an engine fire during the December 2013 mission, and “unacceptable fuel reserves” at one point in the January mission, states the letter dated May 20 and cited in a report Monday from Bloomberg.
The Air Force also said it was in talks to address “lesser but still significant flight and ground operations,” but also said the space cargo transport company founded by billionaire inventor Elon Musk has made the most progress among other private firms vying for defense contracts.
In addition to its work with NASA and companies launching commercial and research satellites into orbit, SpaceX is seeking contracts worth billions of dollars to boost secretive Pentagon satellite missions into orbit.
SpaceX wouldn't comment on its efforts, but NASA released the following statement to International Business Times Monday:
NASA has successfully returned space station resupply launches to U.S. soil, ending our reliance on other countries to get to space and bringing the associated jobs back to America. Our private sector partners in this effort are meeting their obligations under their Commercial Resupply Services contracts. The contracts and certification process allow us to work with Orbital Sciences and SpaceX to ensure that flights are as safe and reliable as possible. To date, NASA's partners have delivered about 14,000 pounds of vital supplies to the International Space Station, including science and research experiments, supplies, and hardware for the orbiting laboratory.
Currently only Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT) and the Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) have clearance to perform Pentagon missions through their United Launch Alliance joint venture. SpaceX designs and manufactures its rockets in the United States. Lockheed's Atlas-5 rocket uses the RD-180 engine while the Boeing Delta IV rocket uses the RS-68 engine manufactured by Aerojet Rocketdyne of Rancho Cordova, California.
Eddy Cue and Zane Lowe on exclusives and why their service rules hip-hop.
Apple has released the latest numbers for the music subscription service Apple Music. In the 18 months since the service was launched, the tech giant reveals that it has just crossed the 20 million paid subscribers mark. It last reported 17 million subscribers in September, marking a 15 percent jump in three months.
In addition, the company announces that 60 percent of customers using Apple Music have not bought content from the iTunes Music Store in the last 12 months -- a portion of which are dormant users but "the vast majority are new customers," Apple's svp of internet software and products Eddy Cue tells Billboard. Now available in more than 100 countries, over 50 percent of Apple Music subscribers live outside of the U.S. -- in such markets as Canada, China, South Africa, Japan, Russia, Brazil and India -- states the company.
Apple is also touting its success in launching a slew of No. 1 albums, among them releases by Drake, both solo (Views) and with Future (What a Time to Be Alive); Frank Ocean's Blonde; Future's Evol; DJ Khaled's Major Key; and Travis Scott's Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight.
"It's been quite a year," says Cue. "We were thrilled to see that we could take [artists'] passions and drive them all the way to No. 1. Chance the Rapper, who we put on Apple Music exclusively, hit the top 10 on the Billboard charts [based on streams alone], and I can't recall that being done before."
And despite a mandate from Universal Music Group chairman Lucian Grainge, exclusives will continue in the near future "where appropriate," adds Cue. "They work really well for everybody concerned -- they're great for the label, they work for the artist and for us." But an across-the-board Apple policy concerning such promotions doesn't exist. "It's really about launching things," says Cue. "Sometimes it makes sense to do that."
In the case of hip-hop artists, Apple is clearly leading the streaming charge and helping influence traditional radio and club play as well. Not surprising with Interscope Records founder and Dr. Dre bestie Jimmy Iovine at the helm, but Cue adds that Apple has long looked to give the genre more exposure, even if the Silicon Valley institution has traditionally been affiliated more with rock acts like U2 and Cue's favorite Bruce Springsteen. "We've always thought that hip-hop was underrepresented both in iTunes and in the streaming chart. And more people listen to hip-hop now than ever before so we've done a lot of work in that area."
The speed with which Apple has built the streaming service -- essentially starting from zero in June 2015 -- may be even more impressive than the latest numbers, which still trail competitor Spotify by 20 million. Cue, who spoke to Billboard alongside Beats 1's Zane Lowe, says "of course we want more and we want it to go faster -- we're hungry!" But, he adds, "We can't forget that, as an industry, we still have very few music subscribers. There are billions of people listening to music and we haven't even hit 100 million subscribers. There's a lot of growth opportunity."
There is also increasing competition, with Amazon and iHeartRadio jumping into the subscription game and Pandora having just launched Pandora Premium. Is there room for all these services? Cue seems to think so. "If they drive more people to pay and buy music then that's a good thing for all of us," he says. It's a sentiment shared by Lowe. "It's great for fans. Here are people trying to make music valuable, and that's part of the conversation. Whether it's Chance or Car Seat Headrest or Russ, our job to reflect the most exciting music of the day. And personally, I want music to take its rightful place as a priority in people's lives. I want it to be front and center."

A swarm of internet nasties descended on Laila Alawa, an American Muslim writer, publisher and activist, after she was targeted last week as public enemy #1 by an assortment of right-wing sites — starting with The Daily Caller then spreading to assorted even more fringey sites from JihadWatch to PamelaGeller.com.
Alawa's most horrendous crime, in the minds of her attackers? She once tweeted that the 9/11 attacks permanently changed the world.
No, really. Here's the tweet that triggered the onslaught of Internet harassment that's made Alawa's life a living hell:
You may notice that she did not say that 9/11 changed the world “for the better.” She said “for good,” a phrase that everyone with even a rudimentary grasp of English should know means “permanently.”
But somehow every right-wing Muslim-hater who saw the Daily Caller post that launched this wave of hate decided that she was praising the terrorist attacks on 9/11/2001 in that tweet. Adding to their indignation: the fact that Alawa had participated in the making of a recently issued Department of Homeland Security report on violent extremism.
Professional Islamaphobe Pamela Geller gave her post on the subject this absurd headline:
Freedom Daily meanwhile, declared:
A site called The Political Insider offered a similarly twisted misreading of Alawa's tweet; the site also managed to transform her work last year with the Department of Homeland Security into a direct appointment by Obama after the Orlando massacre.
Within a few days, there was so much nonsense about Alawa floating around the internet that the urban legend-busting site Snopes.com felt obliged to weigh in with a lengthy rebuttal of the most outrageous false claims, leading the author of the Daily Caller piece to attack the author of the Snopes.com piece as a “failed liberal blogger.”
As assorted right-wing websites and blogs fanned the flames, a virtual army of the internet's worst people descended on Alawa, flooding her Twitter and Facebook mentions with an assortment of angry and threatening messages.
“On Tuesday, June 14, 2016, I woke up to a hell that even I could not have predicted,” Alawa wrote yesterday in a post on The Tempest, an online publication she founded and runs. “Hundreds of people were tweeting at me, the vitriol, hatred and fury in their messages each worse than the last one.”
Here are some of the messages she collected, one of which I've lightly censored:
This fellow gave Alawa a promotion to the top job at Homeland Security:
This fellow showed that he actually does know the difference between “for good” and “for the better” — unless the person using the phrase “for good” is Muslim.
And this lovely lady tossed in a plug for Donald Trump after wishing Alawa a gruesome death:
Meanwhile, this familiar face did his part to spread the Daily Caller's blatant misinformation:
And all of this because a “reporter” at The Daily Caller searched through at least two years of her tweets in order to find a “smoking gun” tweet that turned out to be neither smoking nor a gun.
In her post on The Tempest, Alawa put the tweet that offended the world in context:
“Just like every American, 9/11 was a tragedy that hit close to home,” she wrote.
I was 10 when it happened, living in upstate New York, and the event and ensuing aftermath left me – and the nation – reeling. So much so that it changed my career path for good – I now fight to ensure that every woman, no matter who or where or how she is, has a media outlet to find a space in. So in 2014, upon the anniversary of the attacks, I sent out a tweet, like I do every year, about the events that had transpired.
She explained the difference between “for good” and “for the better,” knowing full well that it wouldn't make any difference to
the thousands and thousands of people taking it upon themselves to comb through my private history, any public articles I had written, any photos I had online.
She recounted the abuse she'd gotten over the past week:
I received rape threats, death threats, and images that made me almost throw up. People, furious and filled with a hatred against someone they didn't even know, had decided I was the perfect target for the entire week. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. Each morning, I'd wake up, and suddenly remember what was happening online, and want to go back to sleep. All I could do was numbly block and report, block and report. … I kept laughing when I told the story in public, because if I stopped, I knew I'd start crying. I'd step away from my phone for 5 minutes, and come back to a hundred notifications.
People told her it would get better.
It didn't get better. It still hasn't gotten better. I'm now enemy #1 of racist, conservative, Trump-loving America, the favorite obsession of white supremacists and “patriots,” clickbait for every possible conservative platform and bigots like Pamela Geller, Allen West, and Milo Yannoupolis.
The bitter irony at the heart of all this hate? These abusive, vicious, barbaric right-wing bigots have somehow managed to convince themselves and their followers that they're the ones defending Western civilization from barbarism.
H/T to Orion Anderson for sending me Alawa's post.

Well, it appears that Muammar Gaddafi's reign of terror is at an end. For decades he's ruled over Libya with an iron fist. For perspective, realize that, a joke about him dying in a sitcom made all the way back in 1987 got a thunderous applause from the audience. Pretty crazy, huh? What's even crazier though, is that that sitcom actually predicted his death as happening in…you guessed it…2011.
For some reason, 2011 was a good futuristic year for the entertainment world to set predictions in. And the strange thing is some of them have come true.
The sitcom in question was called Second Chance. It aired for one season in 1987 through 1988. Here's the premise from Wikipedia:
“In its original format, the show starred Kiel Martin as Charles Russell, a deceased man, and Matthew Perry as his younger self, who is nicknamed Chazz. In the year 2011, Charles dies in a hovercraft accident, and his soul is promptly sent to the high spiritual palace of Saint Peter (Joseph Maher). It is there that Saint Peter determines that Charles is too good for hell but not good enough to get into heaven; therefore, Charles is sent back to Earth in the year 1987, to re-join his life during the teenage years in order to help himself, through the younger Chazz, make more moral choices.”
In the first scene of the pilot, set in this wacky space-age year, we see Kiel Martin's character arrive at the Pearly Gates for judgment. However, before he does, Gaddafi gets his chance. Quote St. Peter; “Ah, Colonel Gaddafi. Dead at last.” Gaddafi is then condemned to be a human bomb in Hell, blown up every two minutes. Cue rapturous studio audience applause.
Pretty clever, Second Chance. But where's my hovercraft?
Side note: Do you think an actor goes through an existential crisis when they realize they've played both the young and old sides of an age-swap story?
Watch the scene in question below. The Gaddafi stuff begins around the 2:20 mark. Although, please feel free to enjoy a bunch of wacky “dumb beauty pageant winner” jokes beforehand:

Fifty-four years after a federal court placed Huntsville City Schools under a desegregation order, the school district is still trying to prove it's making progress despite changes in leadership, school board drama and new discipline procedures.
"The past school year was a pretty rocky year," U.S. District Judge Madeline Hughes Haikala told a crowded courtroom on Wednesday during a public hearing designed to let Huntsville City Schools update the court on steps the district is taking to implement a plan - called the consent order - that would allow the school district to prove it no longer operates as a racially segregated system.
The hearing lasted all day, as attorneys for the U.S. Department of Justice and for the school system presented data and information related to the consent order's implementation.
The courtroom remained near capacity the entire day, with a mostly even split of black and white spectators that included the school board, central office administrators, representatives from auxiliary groups like the PTA and the Schools Foundation, members of the Desegregation Advisory Council, and North Huntsville community groups.
When Haikala addressed the courtroom at the beginning of the hearing, she noted the system's lack of stability in recent months. The district has had two superintendents and an interim superintendent over a year that's been marked by squabbles among the school board, yet another overhaul of the discipline system, and the reworking of the district's alternative school program.
Constant change has made it more difficult for the district to move forward on the consent order, said Haikala. "I don't think the school system had the baseline (stability) last year that was needed."
She heaped praise on new Superintendent Matt Akin, saying she was impressed by what he has been able to accomplish in his six months on the job. She toured schools with him this week and said it was "incredible" to see him shake every teacher's hand and greet many by name. The district has made strides, she said.
"I've never seen a school district with as many assets as this school district (has)," she said.
Akin told the court that implementing the consent order is "vital" to achieving his oft-stated goal of Huntsville becoming a model school system for the nation.
"Everyone sitting here knows there are division in the community and divisions on the (school) board," said Akin. "Each of our districts has challenges," from the geographic challenges facing the sprawling west Huntsville district to the extreme poverty in North Huntsville, he said.
But, he added, "I believe the provisions of the consent order push the school system to (benefit) all children."
Public concerns
Catherine Hereford addressed the court during public comments at the end of the day. Her grandfather sued the district more than a half-century ago to end dual schooling and launched the legal case that continues today.
She urged the district and the court to not ignore concerns of the black community in Huntsville, particularly in the north part of the city.
"A lot of people in North Huntsville feel they have been treated as less-than, particularly in the decisions that have been made for North Huntsville," she said.
One concern that she said seems to have fallen on deaf ears is the North Huntsville community's concern over the district's decision to build the brand-new Jemison High School and McNair Junior High on the same campus. Some have worried it exposes the middle-school students to more discipline issues at the high school. She wondered aloud if the same decision "had flown in South Huntsville."
Ayoka Billions, the mother of students at Blossomwood Elementary School, said she pulled one of her children out of the school after he was bullied and she felt the school wasn't able to adequately discipline those who bullied him. She worries about friends who have withdrawn their students from schools.
"We've talked a lot about black and white, but where are these kids coming from? They are in unstable homes," she said. "I've spent hours (volunteering) with children who, when there's a noise down the hall, they wonder if it's a gunshot. And we wonder why they can't read. Obviously schools can't always address those things, but that piece is something you can't measure through black and white."
Elizabeth Flemming, executive director for The Schools Foundation, said she has a kindergartener in a Huntsville school and "this process has not been easy for families across the board. I've had friends pull their students out from Huntsville City Schools, and I've had friends who put their students back in Huntsville City Schools.
"Change is not always easy, but in my heart, and after seeing the data we've seen today, we needed to do better by all students across the system."
Teacher ratios
Attorneys for the Department of Justice acknowledged that their interactions with the district overall "have been positive" and that schools had been cooperative in granting access to inspectors. The DOJ has visited several Huntsville schools.
The Department of Justice has been particularly focused on discipline, minority transfers and equitable access to course offerings.
Rolling Hills Elementary in north Huntsville is one school where administrators have not been able to maintain the ratio of black to white teachers outlined in the consent order - the proportion of black and white teachers has to be roughly the same as the proportion of black and white students in the district. Rolling Hills has a higher ratio of black teachers.
This is because the principal has had difficulty finding white teachers who are even willing to interview for teaching positions at the school, said Chris Pape, attorney for the district.
"Of the white candidates (the principal) asked to interview, 77 percent of them declined to even interview," he said. The DOJ attorneys will visit Rolling Hills on Thursday.
Five of the 38 schools in the district have a racial makeup of teachers that is markedly different from the district as a whole.
Another school on the DOJ's watch list is Huntsville High, which began reporting a series of incidents of racial harassment and discriminatory behavior last year.
One of the most egregious events happened shortly after the presidential inauguration in January, said schools attorney Chris Pape, but he didn't give details about the incident. Since that time, school administrators have been working to develop a better climate of inclusion in the school, and streamlining the formal process for reporting harassment.
There's now a formal process for reporting harassment that can be done through the school's website, and reports go directly to the principal and to district staff.
"(Having new harassment reporting procedures) was a positive outcome of what was a challenging time," said Pape.
At predominantly white Blossomwood and Jones Valley elementaries, the district has seen a high number of students withdrawing from the schools. As part of the federal negotiations, both schools saw their zones expanded west of Memorial Parkway to increase student diversity.
"Blossomwood and Jones Valley are two of our most integrated elementary schools," said Pape. The schools struggled through multiple changes to the student code of conduct over the past few years - four different codes without the past four years.
Hamilton said the feedback the DOJ has received indicated the climate at Blossomwood has stabilized, and that while Jones Valley initially better adapted to the new code of conduct, behavior issues have cropped up again more recently. The DOJ has requested more information "about the situation there."
Discipline & behavior
The DOJ heard more concerns and complaints regarding discipline than almost any other topic, said Andrea Hamilton, attorney with the Department of Justice.
The district has overhauled the student code of conduct four times in the past four years as schools struggled to implement programs meant to close the gap between the percentage of black and white students who are disciplined. Several years ago, according to Hamilton, black students were disciplined ten times the rate of white students.
"Those racial disparities meant black students were spending significantly more time outside classroom than white students for similar infractions," she said.
That gap has narrowed slightly in recent years. In the 2015-2016 school year, four times as many black high school students received a disciplinary infraction as white students. Last year that difference shrank a few percentage points to just over three times as many black high school students receiving disciplinary referrals as white students.
Overall, the percentage of students with at least one disciplinary referral rose last year for both black and white students.

Achievement gap
Akin identified the gap in academic performance between white and black students as one of the district's biggest challenges.
Last year, only 16 percent of black students passed at least one AP exam, compared with 56 percent of white students. The rate for black students rose slightly from 10 percent in the 2014-2015 school year while the percentage for white students fell during the same timeframe, from 61 percent.
"We still see the same disparity that brought us to the need for the consent order in the first place," said Pape, attorney for the district.
Haikala also addressed the achievement gap:
"The achievement gap isn't unique to this school district but it is a challenge," she said. "if you all close that gap, you will truly be one of the greatest school systems in the nation."
Since Donald Trump won the 2016 election, the stock market has undergone an extraordinary boom. But the market's winners and losers haven't been entirely predictable. The new president filled his cabinet with conservatives interested in lowering taxes, slashing regulations and boosting law enforcement and border security — raising expectations that fossil fuel corporations, financial firms, private prison companies and other businesses would see major gains.
“The irony of this is, some sectors that people generally thought would benefit the most from the Trump presidency are actually negative,” John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, told International Business Times. “But in other cases, where sectors were supposed to be disfavored, they're doing terrific.”
Stock prices in industries including defense, technology, finance and health care are up, while others such as telecom and energy are down. Real estate and utilities have underperformed the market as a whole.
The economy has grown relatively slowly since the election. Economists expect second-quarter growth to be around 2 percent, an average figure in the country's economic recovery, and jobs are growing modestly each month. Wage growth continues its slow, upward crawl.
But stock market indexes, which reflect the stock price values of select major companies — as opposed to the overall strength of the economy — have climbed substantially since Election Day, with the Standard and Poor's 500 up 15.5 percent since Nov. 8. Stock indexes continue to hover around record highs. However, stocks in some closely-watched industries appear to have already crested as the post-election bump subsides.

Adam Johnson, founder and author of investment newsletter Bullseye Brief, says the market is up for two main reasons that have little to do with the new president. “I call it the two e's: earnings and employment. We have earnings growth at 7 to 10 percent and the highest number of people working in four decades.”
Here's how some of the major companies and industries have fared under Trump so far.
Defense Spending Leads To Booming Stocks
The aerospace/defense industry has been on a tear since Trump's election, with stock gains of roughly 25 percent since early November. The president initially proposed boosting military spending by $54 billion and has escalated the United States' involvement in wars in Syria and Afghanistan. After Trump made a $110 billion deal with Saudi Arabia in May, defense stocks hit record highs. The industry expects a significant, long-term shift towards increased military spending.
Raytheon saw its stock surge on April 7 after the U.S. launched the company's Tomahawk missiles in response to a chemical attack on Syrian citizens. The defense manufacturer's stock went from a price of $136.51 on Election Day — Nov. 8, 2016 — to almost $169 as of July 19, an increase of close to 24 percent. Raytheon is among the companies that will likely benefit from increased missile defense spending due to North Korea's recent missile testing.

Trump himself owns between $1,000 and $15,000 in Raytheon stock, according to his 2015 financial disclosure to the Federal Election Commission. The president owns between $50,001 and $100,000 worth of stock in military contractor Boeing.
Aerospace company Lockheed Martin took a hit in December after Trump tweeted that the company's F-35 stealth fighter jets were too expensive, but its stock price has climbed since then. The current contract for the F-35s just increased its price tag to $406 billion. The implementation of Lockheed Martin's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in South Korea, originally scheduled for later this year, was hastened because of tensions with North Korea.
Private Prisons Are Raking It In
With Trump's focus on deporting undocumented immigrants, increased funding to border security and law enforcement, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions' push to crack down on gangs and drugs, private prison companies are having a bonanza in the stock market. By late February, private prison stocks were up 100 percent since Trump's victory.
One of the largest private prison operators, GEO Group, has seen its stock nearly double in value since the election, from close to $16 per share to $30 as of June 19. The company has come under scrutiny for, along with its subsidiary GEO Corrections Holdings, donating $275,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC called Rebuilding America Now, which spent over $21 million on ads attacking Hillary Clinton or praising Trump, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. After Trump won, the company gave another $250,000 to Trump's inauguration committee.
The GEO Group scored a contract to build a large immigration detention center in Texas that will generate $44 million in annual revenue, despite the fact that the company is in the midst of a class-action lawsuit accusing it of violating anti-slavery laws by forcing immigrants to work for less than one dollar per day at a detention center in Colorado.
CoreCivic, formerly the Corrections Corporation of America, has seen a similar increase in its stock value.
The company also put $250,000 towards Trump's inauguration festivities.
Other Winners
With the executive and legislative branches controlled by conservatives, including Trump, who want to weaken oversight of Wall Street in ways such as softening or repealing the Dodd-Frank financial regulations, the finance industry has rallied since November. At the market's opening on June 9, for example, the day after the House passed a bill dismantling Dodd-Frank, one key financial index had gained more than 2.3 percent since the previous morning. And with an improving economy, there will be loan growth, which expands banks' operations and profits.
Johnson sees the contrast between a Trump and a (theoretical) Hillary Clinton White House as substantial. “Banks should be up because [Democratic Sen.] Elizabeth Warren didn't come in to quash them, because [former Goldman Sachs COO] Gary Cohn is the president's counsel and may become the new [Fed chair] come January.”
Goldman Sachs, which has numerous alumni besides Cohn in powerful posts in the Trump administration, has seen a stock value increase of 22.5 percent since Nov. 8.
Materials companies have done well in the market, due in part to investors' confidence that the Trump administration will impose tariffs on imports of foreign-made steel. U.S. Steel had a catastrophic first quarter, but its shares gained 8 percent in June as a result of the tariff talk. Decreased prices of raw materials have also helped increase profitability of products such as concrete and aluminum, says Stoltzfus.
The price of steel has nearly doubled since late 2015, metals analyst John Tumazos told IBT. Combined with expectations of lower corporate taxes, infrastructure spending, trade protection, deregulation and a “buy American” mentality from the Trump administration have all helped the materials industry thrive. Steel production is set to exceed demand, however, and while the industry is probably doing better than it would without a Trump presidency, there are important industry factors that cause fluctuations that the government has little to do with.
“It's hard for me to imagine a scenario of a two-digit steel market growth in the US,” said Tumazos.
Unexpected Losers
The National Rifle Association warned its supporters repeatedly that if Clinton won the presidency, she'd take away their guns on Day 1. But because Trump, who sided with the NRA on gun policy during his campaign, emerged victorious, gun sales dropped significantly.
“It's like opposite day,” said Johnson. “You would think an incoming Trump is good for guns, but it's not, because it removed the urgency.”
FBI background checks, which retailers are required to run whenever selling a gun, dropped by 11 percent in June as compared to June of last year. And that's better than it's been; in January, for example, background checks were down 20 percent from the previous year. The stock prices of the two leading gun manufacturers in the U.S., Sturm Ruger and American Outdoor Brands, went way down on the day after the election, and they've continued to decline.
The NRA, which represents gun owners, spent more than $30 million in support of Trump during the 2016 campaign.
After Trump's November win, coal stocks soared as investors bought into the previously endangered companies buoyed by the victory of a candidate who promised to bring back the coal industry and to repeal President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan. Peabody Energy stock, for example, surged by 47 percent on Nov. 9. While the outlook for coal is better than it was under Obama, and some coal companies have come out of bankruptcy, Zacks Industry Rank still gives coal a negative outlook, placing it at No. 193 out of 258 industries. A glut of natural gas, and therefore low prices, continues to hurt coal usage. Even after news broke in June that Trump plans to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement, fears of a global backlash against coal interests fueled losses in share prices.
“Probably Trump's policies will give the industry a bump up and coal will decline less rapidly than otherwise, but coal still faces competition from natural gas, solar, wind and biomass,” said Tumazos.
Arch Coal rose 25 percent from Nov. 7 to Nov. 10, but it's now back down to roughly the same share price as on Election Day. Cloud Peak Energy stock has dropped 53 percent since the height of investor optimism on Nov. 10, and Southern Company stock is down about 7 percent since Nov. 8. The Dow Jones Coal Index has the industry down by more than 8 percent since Election Day.
“There are 51,000 coal mining jobs in this country. That's it,” said Johnson. “And by the way, JC Penney has 100,000 employees… Trying to save [the coal] industry is pointless.”
Energy in general is down despite the strongly pro-fossil fuel stance of the administration. The Energy Select Sector Index, which consists mainly of companies that primarily develop and produce crude oil and natural gas, is down by 5 percent since Nov. 8. Much of this decline has to do with factors outside the president's control, like growing efficiency in oil extraction and refining technology coupled with improving energy efficiency, helping create today's oil and gas glut, and therefore low prices, according to Stoltzfus.
Johnson says the Trump presidency “really hasn't” affected oil and gas stocks. “Oil is governed by its own fundamentals.”
Unsurprisingly, solar energy stocks also fell after the president announced his plans to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. First Solar quickly lost 2.5 percent, and SunPower Corp went down 3.4 percent. Uncertainty over federal solar tax credits, and likely a lobbying effort to restrict residential solar operations in the states, has also helped bring stock prices down. Despite stocks having suffered, solar jobs in the U.S. are growing at a startling rate.
Valuation is a factor, too, in terms of solar stock prices declining, says Johnson. The stocks “flew to the moon,” he says, “but very few of them make money.”
But Stolzfus is optimistic for renewable energy, especially solar and wind power, in a global context. Over the past 10 years, green energy has become increasingly more efficient and affordable, and it's widely popular, especially among millennials. “Every year traditional energy may remain king of the energy complex, but every year it becomes king of smaller kingdom,” says Stolzfus. In countries that have no vested interest in oil production, alternative energy is growing quickly. Plus, clean energy lowers health care costs and decreases expensive environmental monitoring efforts.
Overall, the market appears to be tolerating, and even feeling comfortable, with the current business environment, despite the unpredictable Trump administration. A new administration may have limited immediate impact on the nation's markets, and large-scale shifts in trade policy are difficult to enact. But the Trump administration has been in power for just six months, and there's plenty of time for more surprises.
There have been tiny hints here and there from members of the American Horror Story cast about what to expect in the show's mysterious sixth season. For the most part, though, Ryan Murphy's stable of actors has been forbidden to do any press at all. But with the year's big twist revealed during Wednesday night's sixth episode, the shackles, as it were, are finally off. American Horror Story star Angela Bassett joined Vanity Fair's Hollywood over the phone Thursday to talk about making her directorial debut on the highly anticipated episode, between bites of salad.
The hour she directed, titled “Chapter 6,” saw the format of the show flipped on its head. Instead of watching a ghostly re-enactment docuseries titled My Roanoke Nightmare, American Horror Story fans saw the in-episode creation of a new show called Return to Roanoke: Three Days in Hell. It's a Big Brother meets Paranormal Activity reality series that sees all the stars of My Roanoke Nightmare crowded into a haunted house. By episode's end, the footage available comes exclusively from hidden surveillance video, confessional-style booths, and hand-held iPhone recordings. It's a tough format for any actor—and a particularly impressive debut for first-time director Bassett, who also had to perform in the episode. Here, she speaks about those formal challenges, drops some hints about what's to come, and, like most people these days, gives her opinion of our true American Horror Story: the 2016 presidential election.
Vanity Fair: Hi there!
Angela Bassett: This is Angela eating lunch. I'm multi-tasking.
Chew away! Did it make you nervous at all to be directing the big twist reveal episode?
It absolutely, positively did. It made me shake in my boots. Fortunately, there was enough grace for each day of shooting. You start each day with some trepidation, but at the end you're like, phew, we got through it.
What surprised you most about making the transition to the other side of the camera?
Car flips, chases, and monsters. Not filming in a conventional way, and always having to remind yourself to skew it a little bit. You want it to look good—keeping in mind the idea of the surveillance cameras—but still you have to make it look lush and interesting. Though sometimes the surveillance shots can be very static. High and wide, you know? But the way the script was written, there was an opportunity to break it up a bit. Filming with iPhones, that whole idea. Not being able to see it as it's happening. Sometimes putting the phones into the hands of the actors. We were becoming our own cinematographers, you know?
How often are the iPhone shots we see actually footage the actors filmed themselves?
It increases as the season goes on. Later on in the season there is more of us filming ourselves. This one, there was a mix. But definitely iPhones in cars as they flip, you know.
You've worked with so many of these American Horror Story actors for years. Did any of them have trouble seeing you as a director and not just their co-star? Did they give you grief?
Not a day of grief, no. You speak their language, you know? I think actor to actor, knowing what an actor's language is—objectives and needs and stakes—just knowing how to communicate with them really helps. Once they squint one eye and say to themselves “oh, she's the director,” they open up both ears and their hearts.
Did you wish you had a simpler episode to make your debut?
There were some moments, oh yes—but I knew I wasn't alone. We had a brand-new D.P. on that episode: Gavin Kelly. He was ecstatic, and his energy was infectious. When I met him, I just said “I trust you!” and I just fell back and was like, “now you gotta catch me!” But with all the camera angles and opportunities [of a found footage shoot] available, we had to fight our conventional instincts of what we're used to seeing. But that meant we could have more fun, and we thought, ”Yeah, we can put cameras anywhere. Because it's all about surveillance.”
Ryan Murphy has said Kathy Bates and Sarah Paulson didn't know about the big twist until Episode 4. Did you have more of a heads-up since you were directing?
I had a little bit of a heads-up. I didn't have the script that far in advance of them, but I did have the advantage of seeing a cut version of Episode 1 and having read Episode 6. I felt more sure-handed about the journey and the arc of the character.
What were the challenges of keeping this season a secret from the world?
We were forbidden to do press, which I was happy about. We could concentrate and have lunch because that's when they want you to do press. You can get your own salad—like, what are these dried tomatoes and pecans and shrimp doing in here? Oh my god. This is too many things in a salad. So it worked for me, keeping it under wraps.
Were you surprised that more didn't leak out?
I was, because, you know, we had stuff in my episode, like the wedding scene where we had guest actors on set. I was surprised that so many kept our secrets. There were a few little things let out, and we were frustrated on set—but then what can you do? And then I had to direct the scene where Kathy's character, Agnes, is running with a cleaver down Hollywood Blvd. I said, “Listen, how the heck are we going to go on Hollywood Blvd. and keep this a secret?” But so much craziness goes on on that street that I think it just looked like another day on Hollywood Blvd.
Since you were playing a version of Adina Porter's character for the first five episodes, did you two work together on developing Lee?
No, we were actually separate until the episode [I directed]. We could only read the words on the page. But Sarah, Cuba [Gooding Jr.], and I had no idea how Adina, Lily [Rabe], and André [Holland] were playing it—which was disconcerting. Were we going to appear to be connected, or is this going to look insane? And sort of like magic, it made sense. Sarah and I would have conversations like, “Okay, it's not like I, Angela, am I playing a character and I own it emotionally.” So it was a strange removal from the character that's hard to explain. So you're playing at someone playing someone who went through something—generations removed.
What are you working on next?
Well, I'm a surrogate for Hillary. I'll be on the road, going around talking to people and trying to put this whole thing to rest.
What did you think about your episode going up against the final debate last night?
I know, that's terrible!! We do a couple of airings, and actually I watched the debate live so I missed the airing last night. But also, I've been in the editing room so I've seen it, like, 20 times. Now that you mention it, though, that's terrible.
But between the two—your episode and the final presidential debate—which was the bigger American horror story this Wednesday?
You know, I don't want to make fun of the uninformed and ill-prepared, but I loved Hillary last night. She was absolutely presidential, and she looked amazing. She came across as so assured and strong. She's got this.

At some point during your journey through life you start to become quieter inside.
For me, coming in contact with this inner stillness and embracing it was the moment that changed everything.
Up until that point, life had felt like a busy marketplace full of the loud, stimulating noises and harsh, continual clashes of energy. I not only felt lonely – it was worse than that – I felt the paradoxical isolation of an outsider; lonely while surrounded by a crowd of people.
Although we all vary in levels of Introversion and Extroversion, everyone can benefit from finding quiet moments to stop, be still, and rediscover the solace of their own company.
Rediscovering the Power of Solitude
Everyone experiences loneliness to some degree – it appears to be a natural and inescapable condition that humans have experienced all throughout the ages.
For most of us loneliness is a product of the toxic connections that we've formed with ourselves, with others and with nature. How many times have you constantly been surrounded by friends, family members, coworkers, neighbors and acquaintances … and yet still felt a sense of disconnection and isolation deep inside? This happens because we've been taught to arrange everything so that it remains separate; we've been taught to possess, to use, to compete and to fear others. Thankfully, through inner silence we can learn to encounter, to communicate and to love again.
It is only by coming to terms with your solitude that you can truly be free to relate with others from a place of inner groundedness.
One of the most startling discoveries that I made while cultivating inner quietness was that we're all alone deep at our very core. We are born alone, we die alone, and although we like to fool ourselves through superficial appearances, we live our lives alone as well. We can try to forget it, we can try not to be alone by making friends, having a lover or mixing in with the crowd. Occasionally what we do on the surface touches our very roots; a lover that reaches our soul, a friend that understands our being – but if that friend is lost, if that lover is gone, those solitary roots will still remain.
To those who rely on the outer world for happiness and fulfillment, this realization is a cause for profound despair. But when you encounter this realization from a place of inner quiet, this truth is full of joy, peace and possibility.
Redefining Quiet
From an external perspective, loneliness and solitude look very similar: they both share the quality of physical aloneness. The similarities end there.
Internally the experience is drastically different. A lonely person is miserable, anxious, incomplete, restless, off-center and dependent on others. It is only through finding the depths of inner quiet that they become comfortable in their solitude, and it is only through redefining what it means to be “quiet” that they can feel happy in their own skin, fulfilled in pursuing their authentic dreams and free from the weight of other's expectations.
Some people claim that being quiet and solitary is the ultimate state of independence, but to me being quiet and solitary is more of a state of interdependence.
When I watch a sunset with a loved one, I know that I could also enjoy it equally much alone – I don't depend on the person's company for my satisfaction. A lonely person however, is more concerned with sharing the experience with the person next to them who is filling their inner void, rather than enjoying the sunset from a grounded place of quiet inner space. Two people who share an experience from a place of inner neediness taint the experience with hidden fears and agendas, however, two people who share an experience from a place of inner wholeness embellish the experience with joy and a purity of intention.
You'd be surprised how much this feeling of loneliness affects us. We mold our entire lives around avoiding isolation and trying to find a way of “removing” it. We study subjects and get jobs that others expect from us. We worry about how to dress, what to pretend to like and what others will think about it. We enter relationships as needy conditional individuals asking the other, “How should I behave and act to make you like me so you don't leave me with this horrible feeling of loneliness?”
Perhaps the best way to illustrate this lifelong escape is by comparing lonely people to beggars who seek anyone's company to mask their inner voids. Solitude, on the other hand, means feeling like a King or Queen. Redefining quiet means being happy with ourselves and being capable of choosing someone's company not because we need them due to an inner feeling of emptiness, but because we want to be with them, from an inner place of wealth.
Cultivating that inner place of wealth requires two things, Quietness and Courage.
Becoming a Quiet Warrior
To be quiet and solitary requires the courage of a lone wolf, a Quiet Warrior.
Only sheep, full of fear and afraid to be alone, live in a crowd and move in a crowd. You've never heard of a lone sheep have you? If you've ever seen a herd of sheep move you'll notice that their bodies are in a continuous friction with one another and there is barely any space at all between them. This feels warm and comforting, and it provides a certain protection to think “I am not alone. There are hundreds of others with me.” Very soon you learn to lose yourself in a crowd.

But the amazing thing about this Quiet Warrior journey is the paradoxical solution to our deepest problem: only by becoming comfortable in our solitude can we finally realize that we are never truly alone.
This realization of never being truly alone can be compared to feeling yourself as part of a large, cosmic puzzle; you begin to feel composed of a myriad of forms and colors, with trees and animals of all types, rivers, clouds, oceans, deserts, jungles, stars, lakes and mountains. You are alone but you are never lonely; you are part of something infinitely vaster than yourself that can only be encountered in those moments of stillness in between thoughts, those moments of quietness in between emotions.
I encourage you to re-encounter and reexamine the connection that unites us with existence; our lost “umbilical cord.” Spending 20 minutes alone with yourself in silence every day is all it can take. Getting in touch with your inner quiet is getting in touch with yourself; it's an inexhaustible presence that can make you feel at home, anywhere, all the time.
Even widespread criticism of their operations has failed to dampen the Conservatives' support for Canada's many mining interests in Africa. Canadian mining companies have been accused of bribing officials, evading taxes, dispossessing farmers, displacing communities, employing forced labour, devastating ecosystems and spurring human rights violations.
• Six months after Mount Polley waste spill, First Nation takes the lead on mining regulation
• Banks Island Gold refused to shut down mine after spill in remote coastal B.C.
• Blood for gold: The human cost of Canada's ‘free trade' with Honduras
But more important than the specific instances of abuse, which I detail in my forthcoming book Canada in Africa: 300 Years of Aid and Exploitation, the mining industry contributes little to sustainable economic development. Instead it vacuums up resources to benefit wealthy people, very few of whom live in Africa.
The mining industry's other reps
The mining industry has found a set of loyal lobbyists in the Harper government. Indifferent to the deleterious impacts of the sector, International Trade Minister Ed Fast has included numerous mining executives in his delegations to the continent, and former foreign minister John Baird focused his visits to Africa on countries where Canadian resource companies sought business. For his part, International Development Minister Christian Paradis praised the sector's development benefits in a bid to (misleadingly) convince African officials that “Canada owes much of its economic growth to extractive industries.”
Prime Minister Stephen Harper has personally promoted Canadian mining companies, for instance, when Benin's president visited Ottawa in 2013. During a trip to Senegal in 2012 the PM met with representatives from several mining firms and publicly lauded the sector.
On a visit to Tanzania in 2007, Harper met with more than 10 Canadian resource firms, calling this an opportunity to discuss “the general business climate [and] what the government of Canada can do to assist in building our investments here.” In the months after Harper's visit, the Canadian High Commission lobbied Tanzania's Parliament to reject the recommendation of the country's Mineral Sector Review Committee that the government keep more of the profits resulting from higher mineral prices.
Government subsidies for extraction
Since 2012 Ottawa has pumped huge sums of public money into mining initiatives in Africa. The public money helped establish branch offices of a professional society, the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum, in Senegal and Burkina Faso as well as a Senegalese school for geomatics (combining geography and information technology to map natural resources).
Last year, Canada pledged $18.5 million of tax money to provide training in the extractives industry in Mozambique, and earlier this year Ottawa announced a $12-million grant for a project called Strengthening Education for Mining in Ethiopia “to develop more industry driven geology and mining engineering undergraduate programs.” In 2014 the government budgeted up to $25 million per year for the Extractives Cooperation for Enhanced Economic Development (EXCEED) initiative, which it described as “a new funding mechanism to expand Canada's involvement in areas of high development impact in the extractive sector in Africa.”
In addition to promoting the sector in general, the Conservatives are now channelling foreign “aid” through mining companies, ploughing millions of dollars into corporate social responsibility projects. One example of this “aid” was a $4.5-million grant to Lundin for Africa, a charity financed by mining behemoth Lundin Group of Companies, for its operations in Ghana, Mali and Senegal. Ottawa also put up $5.6 million for a project between NGO Plan Canada and IAMGOLD near the company's mine in Burkina Faso.
Legal evasion and manipulation
As the Conservatives pumped tens of millions of “aid” dollars into supporting an industry notorious for abuses in countries with weak legal structures, they also blocked domestic attempts at regulation while ensuring Canadian mining companies held the upper hand in foreign jurisdictions.
The Conservatives defeated Bill C-300, which would have withheld diplomatic and financial support from companies found responsible for significant abuses abroad. They also opposed legislation modeled on the U.S. Alien Torts Claims Act that would have allowed lawsuits against Canadian companies responsible for major human rights violations or ecological destruction abroad.
After two decades of privatization and loosened restrictions on foreign investment, mining companies operating on the continent fear a reversal of these policies. And so, in what may be their most significant support to Canadian mining corporations in Africa, the Conservatives negotiated Foreign Investment Protection Agreements with a number of African countries. FIPAs give corporations the right to sue governments — in private, investor-friendly tribunals — for interfering with profits, such as expropriating a concession, changing investment rules or requiring that value-added production take place in the country rather than abroad.
In essence, these agreements aim to counter “resource nationalism.” “Canada appears keen to negotiate FIPAs with some of the most economically and politically vulnerable but resource rich African countries before they develop a taste for resource sovereignty,” notes academic and author Paula Butler in Canadian Dimension.
Canadian policy in Africa has become largely synonymous with the interests of Canadian mining companies. The Harper Conservatives have sought to ensure that the continent's mining policy serves the interests of foreign corporations, the majority of Africans be damned.
Wide ranging report into minority ethnic groups and justice system urges online transparency
Campaigns for more digitally-enabled openness in the criminal justice system have received backing from an unexpected but highly influential source. In his widely awaited report into racial disparities in the courts and prisons, Labour MP David Lammy recommends a substantial increase in the publication of data such as judges' explanations of their sentences - as well as online feedback of how judges conduct cases.
Lammy was commissioned by former prime minister David Cameron to report on glaring disparities between people of different races in the way they are treated by the justice system, from arrest to trial to the sentences they serve. For example black men are more than three times more likely than white men to be arrested, while more than 40% of youth prisoners are from minority ethnic backgrounds.
Lack of trust
While the reasons for the disparity are complex and often not easy to address, Lammy highlights the theme of lack of trust in the system among people of black and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. “The criminal justice system has a trust deficit with the BAME population born in England and Wales, many of whom lack their parents' reverence for our legal system,” he reports.
This has several damaging consequences. For example, people classified as BAME are less likely than whites to plead guilty at an early stage when they are charged with a crime while being more likely to change their plea when they see the weight of evidence against them. This means they are more likely to receive heavier sentences - which in turn builds perceptions that black people are treated worse, reinforcing the cycle of distrust.
Key data gaps
Lammy recommends tackling the problem by addressing “key data gaps”. Proposals include:
Publishing data on magistrates' court pleas and remand decisions. “This should be part of a more detailed examination of magistrates' verdicts, with a particular focus on those affecting BAME women [who are far more likely than whites to be given custodial sentences],” he said.
“The Open Justice initiative should be extended and updated so that it is possible to view sentences for individual offences at individual courts, broken down by demographic characteristics, including gender and ethnicity.
As part of the government's £1 billion court modernisation programme, all sentencing remarks in the Crown court should be published in audio and/or written form. “This would build trust by making justice more transparent and comprehensible for victims, witnesses and offenders.”
The judiciary should work with Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service to establish a system of online feedback on how judges conduct cases. “This information, gathered from different perspectives, including court staff, lawyers, jurors, victims and defendants, could be used by the judiciary to support the professional development of judges in the future, including in performance appraisals for those judges that have them.”
These ideas are likely to gain traction because (unlike some of Lammy's other proposals) they do not involve new up-front costs. Money for digitisation of the criminal justice system has already been earmarked. “At a time when over £700 million has been allocated for the full digitisation of the courts through the court modernisation programme, publishing sentencing remarks would be an important step to a more comprehensible and trusted system,” Lammy notes.
The snag is that Lammy's transparency proposals will require enthusiastic support from judges, currently in a state of cold war with the government over issues ranging from legal aid cuts to the tabloid press to the judicial pension scheme. But the consensus throughout the system that glaring discrepancies in experiences must be addressed will build pressure for something to be done.
David Hawkes's TLS review of Marisa Cull's Shakespeare's Princes of Wales sums up the influence of Wales on Elizabethan England, and on England's Bard in particular:
“The Bard (the very term has a specifically Welsh provenance) had a Welsh grandmother, Alys Griffin. The man who taught him his ‘small Latin,' the Stratford grammar school teacher Thomas Jenkins, was Welsh. At least four of Shakespeare's colleagues in the Lord Chamberlain's men were from Wales. Welsh characters feature in all the English History Plays except King John, as well as in The Merry Wives of Windsor. Cymbeline and King Lear are set in Celtic Britain, at a time before the English bestowed their current, paradoxical appellation on the Welsh. Even the historical Macbeth had Welsh connections.”
The Welsh were, quite literally, the Elizabethan “other”: “The Saxon word Welsch means ‘foreigner.' The verb elschen, to speak gibberish, literally means to speak like a Welshman. The history of English colonialism begins with war on the Welsh, and the colonial dichotomy between centre and periphery has its original in the fraught relations between England and Wales. The contradictory nature of this relation is encapsulated in the very title ‘Prince of Wales.'”
Cull's book uncovers the influences of Wales on Shakespeare's work by examining the various princes of Wales that appear in his plays. Shakespeare comes across as “acutely sensitive to Wales's fundamental role in the construction of English national culture and character. As Cull demonstrates, he embodied and explored the resulting ambiguities through the indisputably central, yet simultaneously marginal, figure of the Prince of Wales.” The sensitivity to the Welsh contribution to England comes most clearly in Henry V's declaration, “I am Welsh, you know.” He's not Welsh; nary a drop of Celtic blood in those veins. Yet, as Hawkes puts it, in Henry “the Other becomes part of the Self.” Not only in Henry, but in the Bard who created the dramatic Henry.
A Hamilton-area father is taking his local school board to court, accusing teachers of failing to accommodate his family's Christian beliefs.
Steve Tourloukis, a dentist and follower of the Greek Orthodox Church, has a daughter in Grade 1 and a son in Grade 4 at the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board. He says that teachers at his children's school have dismissed his requests for advance notice whenever they discuss family, marriage and sexuality in the classroom.
He would like the warning in order to determine whether he should coach his children ahead of the lesson, or pull them from the classroom altogether.
Story continues below advertisement
"My children are my own. I own them. They don't belong to the school board," Dr. Tourloukis said.
He dismissed the idea of sending his children to a private or Catholic school.
"Why should I send my children to another school?" he said. "I pay my taxes…I don't see why somebody else's discrimination should cause me, should influence where I send my children. Not in a free country. Not in Canada."
Dr. Tourloukis told reporters Monday that the school board had rejected his requests to have his children withdrawn on the basis that it discriminated against other students. He filed a lawsuit against the board on Friday. None of the allegations have been proven in court.
The school board's director of education, John Malloy, said he couldn't discuss the specifics of the case, but said broad requests for religious accommodation were relatively rare. It's more common for parents to request specific accommodations around a section of a course such as sex ed.
Broad requests for accommodation may impact other students – who would like to discuss spending the day at the park with their two dads, for example – and are much more problematic.
"It's imperative that any accommodation doesn't hurt someone else in that classroom who has a right to be accepted," Mr. Malloy said.

The board's religious accommodation policy states that schools should "study what all people believe, but should not teach a student what to believe."
Education Minister Laurel Broten said the government took the politics out of creating the curriculum by asking an expert panel to help draft it in 2003.
"We really focus on vetting a number of key components across all of our grades," Ms. Broten told reporters on Monday.
by
Finance Minister Mathias Cormann has hit back at criticisms that his government have not factored in the redundancy costs for the increased number of public servants now facing the axe after this week's Budget.
“The Age of Entitlement is over, as has been made very clear this week,” Cormann emphasised.
“Remember, these people are public servants. There has been way too much emphasis on the public side of the equation and too little attention to the servant side. That will be changing and we know the Australian people will understand these are decisions that have had to be taken.”
When asked about the basic rights any employee enjoys, Cormann was unrepentant. “These people have essentially been on a holiday since Kevin Rudd got his claws out of them. They should consider the last 9 months as entitlements in lieu and leave it at that.”
Under repeated questioning from those assembled, Cormann was visibly strained and ended the press conference promptly when it became apparent no-one was going to ask a question that gave him the option of replying ‘I'll be back”.

Firefighters were still on the scene Monday night after huge flames consumed businesses along Route 101 A in Amherst during the afternoon, leaving just a pile of rubble where the buildings once stood.Click to watch News 9's coverage.The smoke could be seen for miles and the fire quickly reached four alarms.Watch raw videos from the scene: Video 1 | Video 2 | Video 3 “This building was completely engulfed in flames,” said one witness. “There was black smoke – you could see it from Exit 6 or so – the heat was tremendous."View images from the scene.Dramatic eyewitness video recorded during the blaze showed wind-driven flames and smoke destroying Sundance Spas and Amherst Kayak & Canoe.Witnesses said the fire started outside.“The fence line was on fire, and it was jumping – like, eight-foot, 10-foot flames, and then it started going toward the roof so we called 911,” said Mary Winch.The heat from the fire grew so intense, drivers could feel it out in the street.“Oh my God, driving by in my car with the windows closed, it was tremendously hot,” said Jan Lessard.Firefighters from seven communities battled the flames, the wind making their task more difficult by starting spot fires – one of them on top of another business 200 feet away."The building collapsed, the roof collapsed, and it's gone over to this building,” a witness said.Crews halted that fire on the rooftop and slowly knocked down the rest of the flames."It was a task right from the get-go to get this under control,” said Amherst fire Chief Matthew Conley.While Conley said initial reports indicated the fire started in a Dumpster, the point of origin and cause remain under investigation.For now, the fire is not considered suspicious."Not at this time – and again, we're really in the early stages of figuring out 'Was it an external component?' based on reports, and taking that information,” Conley said.Eyewitnesses said there may have been some initial confusion over who was going to call 911, causing a delay.Conley said the first engine made it on scene five minutes from dispatch, and upon arrival, the fire looked like it had a bit of a head start.The site of the fire is the same place where a tragedy occurred on June 16, 1989.The Amherst community was shaken that day when a gunman walked into Farfar's Ice Cream and started shooting.Two people, the owner and a 17-year-old employee, who was the girlfriend of the shooter, were killed, and the gunman took his own life.The tragedy sparked debate at the State House for increased background checks.Get the WMUR app

A Wayne County judge today tossed out a lawsuit filed against Little Caesars Pizza alleging that pork was sold as “halal pepperoni” at one of its Dearborn locations, according to court documents provided by an attorney for the pizza company.
Michael Huget, an attorney representing Little Caesars Pizza, said that Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Susan Hubbard granted the pizza chain a summary disposition — or a motion to dismiss via the court rather than by a jury — in a case brought against the pizza company by Dearborn resident Mohamad Bazzi in May.
A second lawsuit involving different plaintiffs making the same allegations was allowed to proceed.
Majed Moughni, the attorney for Bazzi, said an appeal is being considered because the judge may have made a judicial error in not letting the complaint be amended a third time to prove that there was a cause of action.
In an e-mailed statement sent by Huget on behalf of Little Caesars, the company said it will file counter claims to protect the company against “frivolous actions.”
“Little Caesars is extremely pleased with the court's complete dismissal of this meritless claim,” the company said in the statement.

On the eve of Ramadan, Bazzi filed the complaint saying he twice ordered halal pizza from the Little Caesars on Schaefer in Dearborn.
He alleged that the boxes were labeled "halal," but that the pies inside were topped with regular pepperoni made with pork, food prohibited under Islamic law. Bazzi is Muslim.
Moughni said that in the past week, it was discovered via calls from customers that Little Caesars is no longer selling halal pepperoni and that the halal pepperoni signs at the Schaefer Road location had been removed.
Huget said that according to his client, the “halal pepperoni” sign that has been in the window of the Dearborn store has been taken down because “they are presently out of stock” of halal pepperoni.
“The victory is that've conceded that they've been defrauding the community for a number of years, that they've removed the halal sign, and they removed the pepperoni from their stores,” Moughni said.

According to the court documents provided by Huget, Hubbard denied Little Caesars Pizza's motion for a summary disposition today in a second case also alleging the company sold pork pepperoni as “halal.” That case involves plaintiffs Ali Bazzi and Michelle Meade and is also being represented by Moughni.
“Our next step is to uncover the truth, and the truth is ... they've been negligent and reckless,” Moughni said.

AAP is a party in a hurry.
The first signs of this came up in a hastily convened press conference on Tuesday, when AAP leader Prashant Bhushan levelled a new set of allegations against the DMK and party leader Karunanidhi in particular, claiming that they had access to an incriminating telephone conversation that proved his involvement in the 2G scam.
Today, Chief Minister Arvind Kejirwal directed the anti corruption bureau to file an FIR against his predecessor Sheila Dikshit in connection with the CWG scam, where government and games organisers allegedly siphoned off huge sums of money.
With their image of a 'viable political alternative' to big guns BJP and Congress taking a battering thanks to their recent antics in Delhi, the party is clearly keen to regain their image of anti-corruption crusaders as opposed to the current perception of vigilante moral police.
And with Lok Sabha elections months away, they barely have any time. Law Minister Somnath Bharti's actions have found few takers, and Kejriwal's dharna was quite frankly a disaster.
Many of Kejriwal's middle class supporters who shook off their lethargy to actually stand in line and vote for him were conspicuous by their absence at his recently concluded dharna.. This is a constituency that has come out in droves previously for the Lokpal agitation and the Delhi gangrape protests, a history that makes their absence all the more conspicuous.
And although there were initial attempts to paint the opposition to AAP's actions as the opinion of 'elitist' people who were 'benefitting from corruption', the fact is that AAP cannot afford to alienate this class. For one thing, it pays the bills.
The Economic Times did some basic number crunching and discovered that AAP's online donations declined sharply the day after Bharti's midnight shenanigans were revealed in the media, and continued to drop as Kejriwal went on his dharna. This is a situation that AAP quite literally, cannot afford.
Secondly, the urban middle class is more relevant today than it has ever been before. They cannot be simply discounted, a lesson that Congress has learned much to its discomfiture. For AAP, which has pretty much swung to power on the disgruntlement of this very class, it would be suicidal to continue ignoring the writing on the wall.
So by bringing up in quick succession two scams that triggered off mass public anger, culminating in the formation of the India Against Corruption movement and subsequently AAP itself, the party is clearly trying to remind people why they voted for them in the first place. It's back to square one in many ways. Forget the dharna, forget the moral policing, forget Somnath Bharti. It's the aam aadmi versus big gun corruption.
As Firstpost editor R Jagannathan wrote in this piece, it is this same mentality that has also caused AAP to target the BJP, accusing Arun Jaitley of trying to bribe one of its leaders, Madan Lal, into toppling the Delhi government.
He says, "This involves making wild allegations against both and hoping that Congress will pull support and help AAP achieve martyrdom. It is also intended to provoke the BJP so that it acts like a big bully and make AAP appear like a poor victim".
Its allegations against the BJP and DMK have both fallen flat so far. As far as the DMK was concerned, AAP's actions were very much akin to flogging a dead horse. In terms of the anti-BJP allegations, Madan Lal could not provide proof, and many people discounted it as a publicity stunt.
In targeting Sheila Dikshit, AAP may have finally got it right. But coming as it does on the back of so many mess ups, will this FIR be seen as genuine or yet another publicity stunt?

For the first time in our state's history, wild turkeys are now found in every county of the Lower Peninsula, as well as in several areas in the Upper Peninsula. (Photo: Courtesy photo)
Aside from our vegetarian and vegan friends, how many of us have taken a moment to consider the turkey pre-oven and pre-tryptophan-induced bliss?
With the Thanksgiving season in full swing, let's take a moment to learn a bit more about a seemingly boring bird that has an all but boring history here in Michigan.
For the first time in our state's history, wild turkeys are now found in every county of the Lower Peninsula, as well as in several areas in the Upper Peninsula. This is remarkable when you consider that what was once an abundant population had virtually vanished in those same counties by the mid-20th century.
Humans had overhunted and destroyed the habitat of wild turkey for generations — to the point of extirpation (local extinction). It would take years and the efforts of conservation heroes to bring this bird back from the brink. The comeback of the wild turkey is arguably one of the greatest conservation stories we have to tell.
Now that they're here to stay it's time to learn a few fun facts about this comeback bird:
•The wild turkey is one of the largest birds in North America.
•Wild turkeys live in open fields and woods and nest on the ground.
•Wild turkeys prefer to eat insects, grasses, nuts and berries.
•A baby turkey is called a poult; a teenager is called a jake or jenny; an adult male is a tom; and an adult female is a hen. A group is called a rafter.
•The "beard" that grows from the center of a wild turkey's breast is actually a group of modified feathers that look like hair. Beards are most commonly found on toms, although hens will grow them occasionally.
•Benjamin Franklin wanted the wild turkey, not the bald eagle, to be the country's national bird.
•Wild turkeys are powerful fliers, reaching speeds of up to 55 mph over short distances.
If you've only ever seen a turkey on the dinner table, come on out to Fenner Nature Center to check them out in their natural habitat! Fenner currently has two active flocks of eight to 12 turkeys that frequent the oak tree stand and prairie on the property. They often can be seen crossing the parking lot early in the morning on their way over to the river trail.
For more information on Fenner programs and events visit www.mynaturecenter.org. And be sure to share the cool history of the turkey around your table this Thanksgiving!

Nintendo's new development building located near Minami-Ku, Kyoto officially opened on Wednesday. This will be a new base where both Nintendo hardware and software will be produced, and it will promote the product development and initiative of next-generation game consoles.
The building was created in about a 40,000 square meter area, which was originally a golf driving range site that is about 300 meters north of the new head office building development. It is seven stories high, has one floor basement, and is about 50,000 square meters in total. The total cost was about 19 billion yen. Nintendo has roughly 1,000 employees from the development department of the head office and aggregated about 100 people from a software development center in Higashiyama District called “Kyoto Research Center”.
Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said, “We'll be interacting more deeply with hardware development, but we'll also be able to develop integrated software.”

One of the best years in years
From the rain-slick streets of Gotham City, to the arid desert of Afghanistan, 2015 has transported us across the globe and to worlds beyond. We have slain monsters for coin and breathed new life into an irradiated wasteland. The incredible size and scope of this year's biggest releases is truly staggering, and I am confident we will still be uncovering new surprises within these games throughout 2016 and beyond. This undoubtedly has been the year of the open world, but orbiting those titans are exciting, emotionally-charged games that stand apart from the shadows of their competition and stride alongside them as equals. Without further ado, here are our definitive picks for Game of the Year 2015.
20. Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate
I spent as much time this year using talking cats to fish for lobsters as I did suck the toxic juices out of mega-beetles faces - and that, in essence, is what makes Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate quite so special. An action-RPG built around loot, with no levelling to speak of, your characters skills are determined by the arms and armour they wield - and almost all of that equipment is crafted out of monster pieces youve chopped off in the course of the game. It makes every suit, every blade a map of how you played this strange, massive game. See someone strides into a multiplayer lobby wearing full Khezu armour, and you know theyve had to kill a lot of monsters that look like angry, flying penises.
Stellar localisation, massively improved tutorials and combat systems deep enough to give you vertigo make this a game designed to offer something at all times - Ive farmed in the space between train stops, spent eight hours fighting Elder Dragons on a plane, and spent countless days screaming at friends in my bedroom (mainly because I was playing Monster Hunter). I cant fully explain how something like MonHun exists, never mind on a 3DS cart, but we are very lucky to have it.
19. SOMA
In the five years since Frictional Games released Amnesia: Dark Descent, the studios distinctive horror went from being a calling card to a trendy design style. SOMA wasnt just saddled with being a follow up to one of the most affecting thrillers in video games, it had to teach challengers like Slender: The Arrival, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and myriad others how its done. SOMA is so much more than the "Sci-Fi Amnesia" it first appeared to be, though. Simultaneously defying and exceeding all expectations, it cements Frictional Games reputation as one of the most potent developers working in the field today.
For horror junkies, SOMA is initially befuddling. There are few jump scares, and the games the weakest moments are those infrequent sequences when it reprises Amnesias boogeyman chases forcing you to hide behind corners rather than exploring the games sunken, ravaged research facility. As you plumb further into its world, though, uncovering the sad history of what happened to both the crew and life as we know it, SOMA reveals its true identity as a more classic, existential type of science fiction horror. It excels not at eliciting involuntary screams, but at making you wallow in universal doubt. There were many exciting, frenetic games released in 2015, but SOMA thrilled slowly by asking very big questions before answering them in a variety of equally unsettling and inspiring ways.
18. PES 2016
After years locked in a mutually-destructive physics and AI arms race with EAs FIFA series exchanging blows over enhancements like PES ID, M.A.S.S. Collision System and Emotional Intelligence - PES 2016 nukes the jargon to feel like football. You dont need lightning-fast right-stick tricks to dribble past players, just an intuitive understanding of your players' real-life attributes, and measured sweeps and pokes of the left stick. Yet Konamis defining success isnt individual, but collective: in the way your players make incisive off-the-ball runs, hustle and harry in packs, or segue into preset formations like migrating swallows; mirroring real-life team attributes. The fluid formation system allows your team to seamlessly shift tactics based on phases of play: at kick off, in possession or when chasing the ball. It transforms single-player games against the AI, but makes online multiplayer matches against humans almost maddeningly tactical.
PES 2016 isnt just played on the pitch, but in the 90 seconds of pre-match tactical adjustment, with players reacting to their opponents play-style - or trying to impose their own - desperately shifting players into intricate 11-point-polygons, precision-matching team compactness to passing length, or doubling-down on aggressive pressing. Its the Hearthstone of football tactics, but youll need sublime reflexes and, well, luck to triumph on the pitch. Yeah, the licenses still suck, and Japlish translations jar, but PES 2016 is the series the finest distillation of footballs bittersweet juxtapositions since its PS2-heyday - walking a tightrope between scientific precision and maddening, delightful, unpredictability.
17. Halo 5: Guardians
Much has already been said about Halo 5: Guardians' lackluster (to put it lightly) story, but you can't say that developer 343 Industries didn't take risks, and that attitude extends far beyond plot. Adding aim-down sights was considered by some to be heresy of the highest order, the removal of split-screen prompted petitions, and the news of microtransactions riled the playerbase. A new character taking the spotlight away from Master Chief was equally surprising, as was the new multiplayer mode, Warzone.
While some of these experiments didn't pan out quite the way we hoped, those that succeeded did so in a resounding way. Larger, more vertically-designed battlefields in the campaign kept us challenged, aim-down sights haven't changed the feel of combat, microtransactions feel fairly priced and aren't a slog if you opt to earn them, new traversal options make Halo 5 the fastest and most freeform Halo yet, and Warzone is the best new mode since Firefight. It's a shame about Halo 5's story, but that shouldn't stop you from appreciating an otherwise impeccable package.
16. Ori and the Blind Forest
Theres been a lot said about how Ori and the Blind Forest might make you cry actual tears out of your stone-like gaming eyeballs. Its Ghibli visuals and Pixar storyline hit people where they least expected it - their emotions. I cried too - but primarily at a section where I was using fireballs and my enemies corpses as mid-air catapults to escape being crushed. Ori is arguably the most lushly beautiful 2D game ever created - a neat disguise for a Metroid-inspired platformer with sections designed by, I think, Pol Pot or the Devil.
Its retro, through and through - gear gating, skill trees and pixel-perfect jumps all included - as you help the titular forest spirit traverse the Forest of Nibel to save lives and break hearts. But theres a smattering of modern thinking used to tie it all together. Those looks notwithstanding, a Dark Souls-inspired save system and Bash - one of the single most satisfying new platforming mechanics of the last few years - give Ori the touch of unfamiliarity that makes it feel quite so special. In a year of reboots, this felt more like the platforming genre itself was getting spruced up. It's enough to make you want to cry.
15. Star Wars Battlefront
There's no denying it: The Force is strong with this one. Star Wars Battlefront is easily one of the best Star Wars gaming experiences you can get. Everything from the blaster models and environments to the sound effects and music score is spot on authentic. We can't count the times we just stopped mid-battle to marvel at the space-age chaos, watching the battlefield light up in blaster fire as an AT-AT goes down or getting a closer look at the icy interior of a Wampa cave. As soon as you drop into battle, you feel like you've just taken your first steps into Star Wars' larger world.
The gameplay takes a bit more of a mainstream approach to it, foregoing shooter staples like character classes and intricate loadouts for in-game power-ups and point-and-shoot blaster mechanics that anyone can get a handle on. This is a game for the masses. It's for those fans who have stuck with the series for the last three decades, and the padawans who got a fresh taste of the Star Wars universe with The Force Awakens. What Battlefront does for its audience, it does exceptionally well, and with a massive amount of free DLC and Season Pass expansions on the way, it has the potential to be even better.
14. Life is Strange
When you're a teenager balancing schoolwork, budding romance, peer pressure, and hiding the fact that you're a social trainwreck, you don't need anything else to worry about. But that's not an option for Max Caulfield, who suddenly develops time-rewinding powers in time to save her childhood friend Chloe's life. Thus begins the story of Life is Strange, which manages to combine the supernatural, teenage detective work, and a touching story of friendship (or love, depending on your perspective) into one genuinely engrossing, time-bending bundle.
It would have been easy for a premise like this to go wrong (adults trying to write realistic teenagers and use the appropriate amount of hellas often ends badly), but Life is Strange thrives on the fact that the creators' approach its subject matter with utter sincerity. Domestic abuse, lack of faith in educators, gun violence, suicide - they're all treated with the respect they deserve, and anchored by Max and Chloe's deep and abiding friendship. The story occasionally stumbles along the way (particularly toward the end) and can sometimes feel melodramatic, but its genuine look at what it feels like to be a teenager makes it stand out in a powerful, affecting way. It proves that video games are only limited by what we imagine them to be, and if we open our minds a bit, there are a whole lot of different stories they can tell.
13. Her Story
Were still debating the "real" solution to the mystery at the heart of Her Story, a brilliant tale that plays out over several videotaped interviews in a police interrogation room. I dont mean the whodunnit, though youll likely have a few arguments about that, too, I mean how scribe Sam Barlow managed to tell a story completely out of order and still have it make perfect sense. No two players take the exact same path through the snippets of video tape stored in the polices database, yet the story always seems to unfold exactly as it should.
Her Story is also that most rare of detective games: one that trusts the player to think. Youre given a few important keywords to begin your search through the video archives, but after that, you must rely on your own intuition to locate more clips. Some of your searches will lead you down blind alleys, others will open up entirely new branches of investigation, exactly the way any good mystery should. Her Story is positively ingenious, and were pretty sure the answer is one. Right? It has to be. But then again...
12. Assassin's Creed Syndicate
After the seriousness of Unitys Paris, twin criminals Jacob and Evie Frye are a veritable breath of fresh yet oh-so-polluted Victorian air in this stabby slice of 1868 London. The most modern Assassin's Creed in the franchise, Assassin's Creed Syndicate doesnt just deliver the Batman style rope launcher for portable aerial assassination - stab and go! - but also vehicles to hurtle around the city and induce horse packed chaos. Admit it, you like shooting the equines just a little too much.
For the first time in literal Creed centuries, our twin Assassins not only have a sense of humour but are genuinely entertaining to spend time with. However, if you say that your favourite character is Jacob instead of Evie, you might actually be broken. Add in a rollicking story that manages to juggle a dual-bladed narrative of hunting for Creed maguffins as well as causing as much gang-related chaos as possible across London, and Syndicate is the most fun weve had with the series in years. To severely paraphrase Oliver Twist, more like this please.
11. Tales from the Borderlands
Nobody saw Tales from the Borderlands coming. Developed by a company renowned for their narrative-heavy episodic games, yet based off a franchise that's notoriously light on story, it seemed like a strange little side-project. But Tales from the Borderlands is full of surprises - stomach-turning, nerve-rending, guffaw-worthy surprises - and works so well that it sets a new standard not just for episodic adventures, but all comedy titles to come.
Starring a goofball salaryman way out of his element, a con-artist who isn't nearly as smooth as she thinks, and a huge supporting cast brimming with eclectic charm, Tales from the Borderlands tells a bizarre story the perfectly captures the best parts of Borderlands and repackages them for fans and non-fans alike. It's hard not to laugh when two characters share a tearful goodbye before falling two feet, feel solidarity with a sassy robot that questions the protagonists' life choices, or twitch uncomfortably when impromptu surgery comes into the picture. It's a ridiculously fun thrill-ride and over before you know it, and soon enough you'll be banging on the Vault gate for more.

Ubisoft's upcoming stealth-action game Assassin's Creed Unity is targeting 1080p/60fps for both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions, level designer Bruno St-André revealed in an interview with GamingBolt conducted at E3 but published today. According to the report, St-André initially said he was unsure about the game's resolution and frame rate, before eventually confirming the details.
Last year's Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag ran in native 1080p (after a day-one patch) on PS4, while the Xbox One version outputted in something below that level. A notable difference between Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and Assassin's Creed Unity, however, is that this year's game is not in development for last-generation consoles like the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.
Assassin's Creed Unity launches October 28 for PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Ubisoft has strongly suggested that a new Assassin's Creed game is coming to Xbox 360 and PS3 this year, but Ubisoft has yet to formally announce a 2014 title for those platforms.
Currently, many multiplatform games--including heavy-hitters like Battlefield 4 and Call of Duty: Ghosts--run in a higher resolution on the PS4 than the Xbox One. But, thanks to an Xbox One developer update released this month, it now appears that Sony may not hold a resolution advantage forever.
All Evidence Points to an Immersive Racing Experience in Gran Turismo Sport
We are racing closer to the release of Gran Turismo Sport; such is what we deduced since Sony has just revealed new content at the Geneva Motor Show. Their latest entry in the popular racing series is gearing up its release on the PS4 and PS4 Pro, and fans can witness for themselves the stunning, dead-defying races as they'll appear on console. Watch the new trailer below:
With stunning visuals and lighting, the amount of work gone into development is on display. Gran Turismo Sport has been optimized for HDR and will most likely serve another pillar for the PS4 Pro. It might also explain the delay from its initial release last year. In addition, supplementing their focus on an immersive racing experience, Sony has announced its partnership with TAG Heuer; the Swiss company shall serve as the game's official timekeeper.
“On the 8th of March 2017, at the TAG Heuer booth at the 87th Geneva International Motor Show, it was announced that TAG Heuer would be the official timekeeper for Gran Turismo Sport. TAG Heuer will appear as the official timekeeper and official watch of Gran Turismo Sport in all areas of the game, and TAG Heuer's Live Timing technology will be used to provide players with an experience that's just the same as real motor racing.
“TAG Heuer has a long history of partnerships with some of the greatest legends in motorsports, and Gran Turismo Sport is attempting to redefine the next century in the history of motorsports. Please enjoy a small selection of images, designed to represent the worldview envisaged by this collaboration.”
Moreover, a new series of screenshots was released that you can check out below:
While we still don't know the game's release date, we know developers are hard at work to deliver a premium experience when it hits shelves. We gathered as much from the 140 cars they announced would be available upon launch. With so many beautiful vehicles and stunning races on the fringes of sanity, it is clear we have much to look forward to.

Security researchers have found a live Web exploit that detects if the target is running Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux and drops a different trojan for each platform.
The attack was spotted by researchers from antivirus provider F-Secure on a Columbian transport website, presumably after third-party attackers compromised it. The unidentified site then displayed a signed Java applet that checked if the user's computer is running Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux. Based on the outcome, the attack then downloads the appropriate files for each platform.
"All three files for the three different platforms behave the same way," the researchers wrote in a blog post. "They all connect to 186.87.69.249 to get additional code to execute. The ports are 8080, 8081, and 8082 for OS X, Linux, and Windows respectively."
The growing popularity of Macs has ushered in a rash of new malware attacks that target the platform, most notably the Flashback menace, which infected more than 650,000 machines. Reports of real-world attacks on the Linux operating system are less common, but they do happen, most notably those from last year that infected some of the top Linux developers. But single attacks that have the ability to infect any one of the three OSes are even rarer.
Surprisingly for such an advanced exploit, it was unable to infect modern Macs unless they were modified to run software known as Rosetta. The software allows Macs using Intel processors to run applications written for Macs using PowerPC processors, which were phased out about five years ago. Rosetta is no longer even supported on Lion, the most recent version of OS X.
The F-Secure post said the hacked website and the server used to control infected machines have been reported.

Rod Hadley's story; hope for people with serious disability December 18, 2013
Back in May 20 12 a post popped up on the OMS Facebook page from Suzanne Hadley in North Queensland. She was sharing her husband Rod's story, and her own distress at feeling she may have to put him into full time nursing care because his needs were so great. Unable to walk or stand, or transfer from his power chair, Rod was incontinent, living under a cognitive fog, unable to feed himself. He had recurrent bladder infections that saw him regularly hospitalised, and he had very high anxiety.
But the reason for Suzanne's post to the OMS site was that after 20 years of MS decline, and faced with the hardest decision of their lives, Rod had made some lifestyle changes and started to see some slight improvements.
It is now over 18 months since that first report on Rod's progress. Since then the couple have attended a retreat, tightened up further on their diet (they both eat a vegan plus fish diet), raised vitamin D levels, and remained hopeful and positive. This week Suzanne talked about their journey of the last 20 months, the improvements they have seen, and the difference it is making to their lives. She really wanted to be able to write this blog herself, but too little time (she runs a full-time legal practice) and too much emotion kept getting in the way. We're very grateful to both Suzanne and Rod for sharing it this way; it is an inspiring story, and it's not over yet…
Rod Hadley was diagnosed with MS back in 1993 when he was a sales manager and business owner, a very sociable family man with an outstanding memory and a passion for adrenaline – think motorbike riding, spear fishing, hang gliding, go kart racing to name a few. From the start his critical thinking skills were affected and within two years he was out of work and having trouble with walking and fine motor control. By 2000 he was told his MS was progressive so the pharmaceutical drugs he'd been taking were abandoned. Rod didn't feel they'd done much to help him anyway.
At his 50th birthday party in 2002 Rod could barely stand up; Suzanne had to hold him up while he was making his speech.
He started using a walking frame, then when his legs would crumple beneath even that, he moved on to a wheelchair. For a while he drove a power scooter to get out and about, but by 2011 he had given that up too – his hands didn't have the strength to operate the controls and he couldn't concentrate enough to drive it. In late 2011 Rod started having recurrent bladder infections needing hospital treatment. “It was the most awful time of my life and by the time February 2012 came around I really felt he was nursing home material,” Suzanne says.
But then in March two things happened. First, Rod was referred to a therapist in Tully for Fast Magnetic Pulse Induction, a procedure where lengths of electrical cable were placed around his neck while emitting a pulse. Rod had been completely bladder incontinent for years, but after that he sensed some improvement.
And importantly, the other thing that happened was OMS. “We found George Jelinek's Overcoming Multiple Sclerosis book, and I read it since Rod had lost the capacity to read a few years earlier,” says Suzanne. Rod's vitamin D level was 60nmol/L at that time, and he started supplementing to get it above 200 where it sits today. They also moved to a vegan plus fish diet, removing chicken and beef as well as dairy. They later removed coconut milk and palm oil as well.
Another infection saw Rod hospitalised in May 2012, and Suzanne remembers him whispering to her through his exhaustion “tell them I'm vegan”. When Rod came out of hospital on 19th May he announced “I feel really good,” and the next day he declared “I'm going to walk”. He wheeled out onto the couple's deck, stood up and grabbed hold of the rail and walked the length of the deck. He continued to do that every day for a while, and although he has suffered some setbacks with his walking following an illness in June he is still more mobile than he has been for years.
At the same time Rod's thinking skills, pain levels, general mobility, anxiety, and incontinence issues have all improved. And he's only been in hospital once in the last year, which is a huge improvement.
One of the first things Suzanne noticed was that Rod could sit up at night until 10pm, whereas he used to be in bed by 8pm. And his critical thinking skills started to return. He was able to understand and follow TV shows again, and he no longer felt that he was living through a fog. “There was something on the radio this morning and he actually followed it and was laughing,” Suzanne says. “Those little milestones make me very happy.”
All this means that Rod is becoming a more active participant in his own life, and in Suzanne's life too. Last week she asked him what he would like to eat and he said “what are you having?” which was a big thing because communication has been a bit of a one way street for years.
Rod is once again able to feed himself, mostly, and has started to dress himself again. Previously needing total assistance to shower, he now drives his wheelchair into position, stands up, takes a backward step into the shower chair, sits up and showers himself. He is then able to step out of the shower and help putting on his clothes. When they go out in the car Rod drives his wheelchair to the back of the car, walks (using a handrail) the length of the car to the passenger seat, gets himself in and puts on his own seatbelt. Previously Suzanne had to struggle him into the seat by herself.
Rod's pain from trigeminal facial myalgia – “wicked pain that we both used to cry at” – has vanished. He sleeps through the night pretty much every night, and after years of total bladder incontinence he is now re-gaining control.
He still uses a wheelchair.
The photo at the top of this blog was taken during a day trip to the races last month. Starting at 5.30am the couple travelled by boat from Cairns to Cooktown, getting changed into their race gear on the way. Rod entered, and won, the competition for the best dressed male, and Suzanne came home with the ladies classic. The weather was pretty rough on the way back and they finally made it home by around 11.30pm. “For Rod to go on a trip like that and actually have a really great time was just the most amazing thing,” says Suzanne.
This story offers hope to anyone who has been severely disabled by MS, anyone who has been diagnosed for a long time and perhaps feels that OMS is not for them, that it only works for the newly diagnosed, or for people with relapsing remitting forms of the disease. Rod Hadley was almost totally incapacitated by MS – in his wife's own words he was “nursing home material”.
But not any more.

Police in Saanich, a Victoria suburb, say the motorcycle in the video is this Yamaha R1, which was seized in April. (CBC)
A man allegedly responsible for a viral YouTube video showing a 300 km/h motorcycle ride on a highway outside Victoria, B.C. has turned himself in to police, Kelowna RCMP say.
In June, Saanich police issued an arrest warrant for Randy George Scott, 25, for the dangerous operation of a motor vehicle.
Scott is in custody after turning himself into police Tuesday night and will appear in court on Wednesday, Kelowna RCMP Const. Kris Clark said.
"He came to the front counter and made an admission as to his identity — that he had a warrant out for his arrest," Clark said.
The video shows the driver of a motorcycle going at high speeds, at one point nearing 300km/h, weaving between vehicles and sometimes passing along the centre line. At the time, veteran traffic officers and professional motorcycle riders were shocked by the footage, and said it was lucky no one was killed.
"It should be noted that videos such as this glorify dangerous driving behaviours, which is a direct contradiction to our commitment to road safety" Clark said.
The video was posted to YouTube on April 8, and just over a week later, Saanich police seized a blue Yamaha R1 — the motorcycle believed to have been used in the video.
Officers said the bike was registered to the rider's mother. They said the rider was unlicensed, uninsured and believed to be a 25-year-old man with 25 previous infractions.
University Student Government Can't Take A Joke; Pulls Paper's Funding After 'Offensive' April Fool's Issue
from the just-because-you're-not-laughing-doesn't-mean-it-isn't-funny dept
April 1st is generally acknowledged to be the shittiest day on the internet. Suddenly, everyone who isn't The Onion thinks they are, and trusted sources of information become sketchy entities in need of copious amounts of side eye.
That's the worst of it. Then there are others that celebrate the most worthless of quasi-holidays by going completely overboard. The Record, Buffalo State College's newspaper, turned itself into the The Wreckard on April 1st, publishing several satirical stories.
Some on campus weren't wild about The Wreckard, including student government president Emily Leminger. She emailed the newspaper staff and told them their April 1 edition was “a very serious matter.”
She wrote:
It has come to our attention from many students and faculty members that some of the topics discussed in the ‘Wreckard' satire addition [sic] were offensive to members of Buffalo State and the surrounding community.”
Please note that your budget has been frozen, all publications of ‘The Wreckard' must be removed from campus tomorrow by 5PM and relocated to your office.
“The April Fools edition of The Record clearly was satire from the obviously altered name and typeface to the topics,” Franczyk said, “which no one should believe to be true. The edition was witty, smart and sharply written and was meant for nothing more but the entertainment of the student body.”
Hello Community & The Record, After much consideration; we have reconsidered our actions about freezing your newspaper budget. Our initial actions were made based on the concerns we received from several students. As United Students Government, students come first. The removal of the "April Fools" edition of the paper was called in order to protect our students from feeling uncomfortable. However, The Record you're our students as well! & the freedom of speech and press proves that us limiting your distribution, is not right. After considering both sides of concerns, we will continue on reaching out to The Record for a meeting where a medium can be reached. We appreciate all of the efforts from alumni, media, and students pertaining the issue. Communication is the most important tool of all, and we would like for The Record to be a wonderful platform for communication to our community, as well as making sure students feel comfortable and protected by USG. Once again, we look forward to talking to The Record at their earliest convenience. Thank you to all. -USG Team
And, in doing so, found out its student government not only couldn't take a joke (like "President Conway-Turner authorizes drone strike on top UB leaders, killing 12"), but was also capable of being offended on behalf of everyone in the community The offended students and community members failed to materialize in defense of Lemminger's decision. Butadviser and journalism professor Annemarie Franczyk showed up to criticize the student government's demands Realizing the decision to play on the Unspoken (and Unbidden) Feelings of the Unspecified Masses was gaining it zero traction anywhere but in the student government's collective imagination, it swiftly reversed its decision. This announcement followed shortly after its budget-yanking statement. Fortunately, the student government only controls the purse strings, rather than writes the articles.As an ode to free speech, it's anything but. It possibly works better as a paean to the flaws in our higher education system -- from its inexplicable desire to protect young adults from any sort of unpleasantness to the unavoidable feeling that the university is cranking out a generation of graduates who can't communicate fluently in their native language, much less be convinced that punctuation isn't the "salt" of written communication: something to be scattered liberally and randomly across bland and badly-composed prose in hopes of "taking it to the next level."Lessons were learned… and quickly. But will they stick? The announcement suggests the student government prizes "comfort" and "protection" over free speech. This isn't exactly comforting, considering it holds the financial means to sacrifice the latter for the former.

President Trump has nominated Neomi Rao, a conservative lawyer to run the obscure but powerful Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, a gateway through which federal regulations must pass. (George Mason University)
Neomi Rao, a little-known law professor at George Mason University, could soon become one of the most powerful officials in Washington.
President Trump has nominated the conservative lawyer to run the obscure but powerful Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, a gateway through which federal regulations must pass.
The office, known as OIRA (pronounced oh-eye-rah), would make Rao the Trump administration's regulatory czar, responsible for vetting and tallying cost estimates for most regulations. The office also resolves conflicts between agencies, and can either sink a rule or send it back for major rewrites.
Rao would also be in a position to promote her conservative views. A critic of “the administrative state” that White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon has vowed to deconstruct, Rao has written that the independence of federal agencies should be abolished, their rules subject to White House review, and the heads of those agencies subject to dismissal by the president.
In past administrations, the OIRA administrator has played the role of a check on ideology, but with Rao and many department chiefs all pushing for deregulation, OIRA's role as objective analyst could be compromised.
“OIRA is the mediator, the referee when agencies are trying to put through regulations,” said Ted Gayer, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. “It could be enormously influential in any administration and in this administration even more so because so much of the efforts are going to be on the deregulation side rather than legislative accomplishments.”
Trump's executive order that two regulations must be eliminated for every new regulation — and with costs and benefits that match — hands even greater authority to OIRA.
In addition, because of the growth of science-based regulations, OIRA has increasingly weighed in on controversial science debates. About a decade ago it hired experts in public health, toxicology, engineering and other technical fields to supplement its experts on policy and economics. Under Trump, it may also have to deal with climate issues.
People familiar with Rao's writing say it does not show whether as OIRA director she would stand up to an administration bent on tearing down much of the government's regulatory regime. Trump has said that “we can cut regulations by 75 percent.” But the OIRA director typically lays out the cost of eliminating regulations as well as adopting them.
Among the more controversial aspects of Rao's writings is her support for the power of the president and the need to bring independent agencies under control of the White House.
One example: Rao has written that the Dodd-Frank financial reform law's creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whose director can be removed only for “inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office,” violated the Constitution and was based on acceptance of “virtually unlimited congressional authority to impose limits on presidential control.”
A case challenging the CFPB's independence is before the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. But Rao's critique extends far beyond the CFPB.
Rao “appears to support bringing independent regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Reserve under OIRA review, which would be a major expansion of OIRA and White House control,” Curtis W. Copeland, formerly a specialist in American government at the Congressional Research Service, said in an email.
“There is also a recent article where she indicates that the President should be able to fire the heads of independent regulatory agencies (who currently have ‘for cause' removal protection),” Copeland added. “Congress set up these agencies to be independent of the President. If the President can fire the heads of these agencies, and (through OIRA) can say whether or not they can issue significant regulations, that is a huge change.”
The Supreme Court has upheld the independence of certain agencies going back more than a century to cases involving the Federal Trade and Interstate Commerce commissions.
Not surprisingly, some liberal groups have opposed Rao, who must be confirmed by the Senate.
“President Trump has proclaimed that his intent is to defang regulatory agencies and gut regulatory protections,” Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, said in a statement. “But the OIRA administrator has a duty to ensure implementation of the laws of the land, which require government agencies to issue new rules to advance their missions, not to give corporations a free hand to pollute and pilfer, poison and profiteer.”
In articles and congressional testimony, Rao has also advocated limiting the authority of federal agencies to draw up rules in areas left ambiguous by legislation. She has said that Congress must spell out clearly what it wants agencies to do. Critics, however, say that when it comes to technical regulations, lawmakers lack the expertise to write detailed regulations the agencies are better equipped to draw up.
Rao has called on the courts to review the judicial principle known as Chevron deference, which leaves it up to agencies to interpret ambiguously worded statutes to fulfill legal mandates.
“Deference is one consequence of Congress leaving a significant interpretive space for administrative agencies,” she said in March 17, 2016 testimony to the Senate Homeland Security Committee's governmental affairs subcommittee. That error has been compounded by the courts, she said, which have also deferred to agencies and have “allowed for the expansion of the administrative state outside the checks and balances of the Constitution.”
Rao has an impeccable conservative track record. A graduate of Yale University and the University of Chicago Law School, she clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. In 2016 when Thomas's clerks set up a laudatory website about him, Rao told USA Today that he was “more willing to go back and overturn precedents, to go back and find the original meaning of the Constitution.”
Rao also served as an associate counsel and special assistant to President George W. Bush. Later, she moved to George Mason where she received tenure in 2012. In 2015, she founded the Center for the Study of the Administrative State. Events there have featured critics of federal regulation.
OIRA, created as part of the Office of Management and Budget by the Paperwork Reduction Act in 1980 under President Jimmy Carter, was given a broader role under President Ronald Reagan to review the impact of regulations. Under Reagan's OIRA director James Miller, the office became known as “the black hole where rules would go and disappear,” said Thomas O. McGarity, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin.
Some administrative law experts fear that Rao and Trump's agency heads will all be pushing in the same direction.
“It is important for OIRA to act as a counterweight to the agencies in the regulatory process,” said Ryan Bubb, a law professor at New York University and a former policy analyst at OIRA.
During the Obama administration, for example, OIRA Director Cass Sunstein — a respected friend of the president — “played an important role in forcing the Environmental Protection Agency to improve its cost-benefit analysis of proposed regulations, often leading to an improvement in the final rulemaking in the form of a less-costly alternative,” Bubb said. In the most public case, Sunstein rejected a version of the EPA's proposed ozone rule, and the president backed him up.
“What you want, in my view, is an energetic, activist agency, counterbalanced by a more centrist, analytical OIRA,” Bubb said. “Key to OIRA's function is for it to inject some conflict and friction into the rulemaking process.”
But there may be little friction between Rao and other Trump officials.
“Scott Pruitt is by all accounts going to focus on rolling back EPA regulations. Given his deregulatory tilt, the key question about Neomi Rao is whether she will be an effective counterweight and force the EPA to justify its deregulatory actions on cost-benefit grounds,” Bubb said.
“When Cass Sunstein was nominated, there were plenty of environmental activists on the left who were disappointed, because they (correctly) viewed him as a likely roadblock to expanding environmental regulation,” Bubb added. “But I am not aware of anyone on the right who is worried that Rao might hold up Pruitt's deregulatory agenda. Hopefully OIRA under Rao will continue to play the centrist, analytical role that it has historically.”

This story was updated to remove a reference to an individual named in an earlier version.
The Utah Legislature took a step last week into territory where state lawmakers rarely tread.
It passed a law giving children conceived via sperm donation access to the medical histories of their biological fathers. The law itself stirred no controversy. The oddity was that the legislature ventured into the area of “assisted reproduction” at all.
Assisted reproductive technology (ART) helps infertile couples to conceive. Compared to many other industrialized nations, neither the U.S. nor state governments do much to oversee the multibillion-dollar industry.
“The United States is the Wild West of the fertility industry,” Marcy Darnovsky, executive director of the Center for Genetics and Society said, echoing a description used by many critics of the regulatory environment surrounding ART.
The federal government requires laboratories engaged in assisted reproduction to be certified by organizations, such as the American College of Pathologists, and to report certain data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). (One exception to minimal federal intervention: President George W. Bush's ban in 2001 on the use of newly created embryonic stem cell lines in research.)
States are split about whether surrogacy contracts, usually between prospective parents and an egg donor, are permissible. But other aspects of ART are simply unaddressed by the states. For example, states don't regulate how many children may be conceived from one donor, what types of medical information or updates must be supplied by donors, what genetic tests may be performed on embryos, how many fertilized eggs may be placed in a woman or how old a donor can be.
Lawmakers are wary of touching assisted reproduction, Darnovsky said, because of the incendiary politics that surround the issue of abortion, which touches on conception and embryos.
In terms of the number of people involved, the issue is significant. The CDC reports that about 12 percent of women of childbearing age have used infertility services and that 1.5 percent of all infants born in the U.S. are conceived using ART.
The first infant conceived through ART in the U.S. was born in 1981. Since then, assisted reproduction has experienced enormous growth. The CDC reports that in 2012, more than 65,000 live births in the U.S. resulted from ART, which generally refers to fertility treatments in which either eggs or embryos are handled. That number does not include artificial insemination, which experts believe results in far more births.
Other countries, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany and Australia, heavily regulate many aspects of reproductive technology. Many scholars, as well as some who have been through the assisted reproduction process in the U.S., believe this country should do the same.
“I think in the United States we need more regulation of assisted reproductive technologies to protect the rights of children, donors and parents,” said Naomi Cahn, a law professor at George Washington University and co-author of the book “Finding Our Families: A First-of-Its-Kind Book for Donor-Conceived People and Their Families.”
Cahn believes donor-conceived children should at least have access to full medical information about biological parents, if not information about ethnicity and country of origin. Parents, she said, should have the right to know how many times a donor's sperm or eggs were used to conceive a child. And donors should have a right to know what happens to their sperm or eggs.
Lack of Regulation Disputed
The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) takes umbrage at the suggestion that ART is lightly regulated.
“I used to call it the ‘myth of un-regulation,' but it's actually a malicious and often deliberate falsehood most often conveyed by folks with ideological opposition to reproductive medicine,” Sean Tipton, the ASRM's chief lobbyist, wrote in an email message. “Reproductive medicine is one of the most heavily regulated fields of medicine in the US.”
As evidence, Tipton points out that the federal government regulates all drugs and medical devices, as well as the reproductive tissues used in ART. States, he said, license practitioners (as they do all medical professionals). But the heart of his argument is that “the professional self-regulation is extensive.”
ASRM does issue lengthy guidelines to its membership, which consists of fertility clinics and sperm banks. However, critics point out, it does not sanction those who are in violation of guidelines.
Critics argue that ASRM's main function is to advance the business interests of its members, unfettered by government regulation.
“It's a field characterized by strong anti-regulatory sentiment because it evolved as a business, not a research enterprise,” said Arthur Caplan, director of the division of Medical Ethics at New York University's School of Medicine.
Debra Mathews of the Berman Institute of Bioethics agrees that the industry is lightly regulated because “assisted reproduction has grown up as a medical services business not under the auspices of medical research.” The federal government ensured that situation would continue when, in 1996, Congress passed an amendment banning the use of federal funds in research related to the creation of embryos.
There are also political reasons politicians have little interest in taking up ART legislation.
“It is unregulated because it touches on two, ‘third-rail' issues,” said NYU's Caplan. “It touches on abortion and also the creation of embryos, which politicians run away from because too many people still disagree about the right to use reproductive technologies, particularly who should pay for them and how much.”
The lack of regulation does have some benefits, critics say. Without regulation, for instance, gay couples and single people don't face any built-in barriers to using ART to produce children.
But others see disadvantages, none more loaded than a lack of restrictions on the number of children that can be produced by any single donor. The concern is that offspring of a frequent donor could inadvertently meet and fall in love, raising the possibility of “accidental incest.”
Donor-conceived children also argue that donors should be subjected to better medical screenings. Generally, donors are only tested for sexually transmitted diseases. There are no laws requiring medical testing for genetic diseases or requiring that donors – usually in their 20s at the time of donation – update medical information as they age and inherited diseases may surface.
Many donor-conceived offspring believe that they, like their counterparts in Britain, should have a right to more than medical information and that the identity of biological parents should be revealed to them.
Many of those who donated eggs and sperm did so in the expectation of a lasting anonymity. They didn't want unknown offspring to one day knock on their door.
But in the Internet age, the expectation or anonymity is increasingly diminished. Several websites, such as donorsiblingregistry.com and 23andme.com, enable those who share the same DNA to connect with one another. Through those websites and other Internet searches, thousands of people have been able to circumvent the anonymity offered by sperm banks and fertility clinics to identify biological parents, half-siblings or cousins.
Donors, Offspring May Drive Action
If there is more regulation in assisted reproduction, it will probably come from those who have gone through the process or were the result of it.
That is what happened in Utah. The sponsor of the bill, Republican Rep. Dixon Pitcher, was buttonholed by an old friend who in her late 60s learned that the beloved, now-deceased man who raised her was not her biological father. The truth unraveled after a nephew with health problems underwent DNA testing.
“It was devastating,” she said. “I think I cried for about three months.” The woman, who asked that she only be identified as "Marie" to avoid embarrassing others, said she has since learned of eight half-siblings, some of whom she has now met.
Through the DNA research and other clues, Marie said that it became clear that the father of all of them was her mother's doctor. Geneticists say that prior to modern fertility technology, doctors of women with infertile husbands often provided the sperm that enabled their patients to conceive.
Marie said she had hoped Pitcher's bill would enable donor-conceived children to learn the identities of their biological parents, but she is pleased that at least some medical information will be made available as a result of the new law.
Other people also are clamoring for information about their donations or their biological parents.
Martin Garrison made donations to a sperm bank that was recruiting students at UCLA when he was a student there in the 1980s. He made $500 a month for making three donations a week. “It was work you could do that wasn't painful,” he said. When he tried later to learn how many children he had fathered as a result of his donations, he kept getting different answers, ranging from one to 10 children. He said the bank never contacted him to ask him for a medical update.
Lisa Swanson, a lawyer, learned at age 30 that she was donor-conceived. When she tried to learn about her biological father, she ran into a dead-end with the clinic that arranged her conception.
“They told me all the records had been destroyed,” she said. “They also said they had no idea how to reach the doctor.”
“I know nothing about half of my genetic health information,” she said. More should be required of the industry, she said. Physicians “are creating human beings but destroying our ability to know where we came from.”

Justin Bieber has landed himself in more hot water after the pop star was photographed spitting from his hotel balcony in Yorkville.
The star separately posted a picture of a crowd that gathered below his hotel room hoping to catch a glimpse of him.
It wasn't clear if the crowd was below his balcony when he spat.
The photos of Bieber spitting were nonetheless reposted around the world.
This isn't the first time the "Baby" singer has been picked out for acting this way. A neighbour, a woman at his gym and a DJ in Ohio have each accused him of spitting at them.
Bieber performed the first of two sold-out shows at the Air Canada Centre Thursday, arriving onstage about 30 minutes late.
His second Toronto show is set to take place tonight at 7 p.m.
eTalk will have exclusive details about the photos at 7 p.m.

A three-day cease-fire in Gaza hit the midpoint on Tuesday as talks of a more permanent truce between Israel and the Palestinians appeared to be stalled.
A senior Israeli official made clear that large gaps between the sides remain to be bridged. The announcement came after it emerged on Monday that Israel has agreed during the negotiations in Cairo to ease conditions in the Gaza Strip.
A 72-hour temporary break in fighting went into effect at midnight on Sunday and was respected by both sides throughout Monday. With the cease-fire holding, the Israeli delegation to the talks retrurned to Cairo.

Palestinian officials told The Associated Press early Wednesday morning that Egypt's proposal calls for easing parts of the Israeli blockade of Gaza, bringing some relief to the territory. But it leaves the key areas of disagreement, including the Islamic militant group Hamas' demand for a full lifting of the blockade and Israeli calls for Hamas to disarm, to later negotiations.
One of the Palestinian officials who spoke to AP said that according to the Egyptian proposal the blockade would be gradually eased.
He said it would stipulate that Israel would end airstrikes on militants, and a 500-meter (547-yard) buffer zone next to the Gaza and Israel frontier would be reduced over time, he said.
The Israeli and Palestinian negotiating teams retired after 10 hours of discussions and will resume the talks later Wednesday, about 12 hours before the current cease-fire is set to expire at midnight, the officials said.
It was not immediately clear if either side would accept the deal. (AP)
11:51 P.M. Disagreements over the opening of the border crossings between Israel and Gaza, including how the crossings will be supervised and what kind of merchandise will be allowed into Gaza, are among the key issues delaying the signing of a cease-fire agreement in the Gaza Strip. A Palestinian source told Haaretz that Hamas is insisting on a complete end to the blockade of Gaza rather than a mere easing of it, which he termed “a more comfortable occupation.”
The Egyptian mediators are trying to find a formula that will satisfy both Israel and Hamas. “The debate is mainly over the wording, not over the fundamental positions,” the source said. Hamas has agreed to allow representatives of the Palestinian Authority to be stationed on the Gaza side of the border crossings, but it rejects any limitations on the entry of construction materials like cement and steel, which are needed to repair the damage caused by the war. Israel, however, is concerned that Hamas would use such materials to rebuild its network of attack tunnels rather than for civilian purposes. (Zvi Bar'el) Read the full article
11:07 P.M. Israel's embassy in the U.K. published a statement in response to the U.K.'s threat to suspend arms export licenses to Israel: "Israel notes the U.K.'s decision to leave in place current criteria for arms export licenses. We share the U.K.'s hope that the current ceasefire will continue and lead to a long term solution. At the same time, should Hamas violate the current ceasefire, as it has previous ceasefires, Israel maintains the right to defend itself, a right which has been recognized and supported by the U.K. leadership. Israel regrets calls to cancel or freeze export licenses, or to condition them on a non-recurrence of hostilities. Political decisions of this nature do not reflect Hamas' responsibility as a serial violator of past cease-fires, and are unlikely to contribute to the goal of negotiating a sustainable solution to the current conflict." (Barak Ravid)
8:43 P.M. The British government has announced that if "significant hostilities" resume in Gaza, it will suspend 12 arms export licenses to Israel. Licenses that might be suspended include radar systems, combat aircraft and tanks used by the IDF in Gaza. The Iron Dome is not included. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: “No new licences of military equipment have been issued for use by the Israeli Defence Force during the review period and as a precautionary measure this approach will continue until hostilities cease.” (Barak Ravid) Read the full article
8:00 P.M. Prof. William Schabas, appointed on Monday as head of the United Nations probe into Operation Protective Web, has acknowledged in an Israeli TV interview that "there are many instances of double standards" at the international body. Schabas was asked by a Channel 2 interviewer why investigations had not been conducted into the American invasion of Iraq, the Russian attack on Chechnya and other incidents in which thousands of civilians were killed while Israel has been probed twice in six years. "The fact that there have not been investigations into certain atrocities in certain places can be explained by the political balance and the relative strengths of the players," Schabas said. "It's very regrettable, but that's the situation." Read the full article
6:42 P.M. The Defense Minister's office has announced that "the defense minister intends on assisting reserve soldiers who have devoted recent weeks to participating in Operation Protective Edge, and make life easier for them by granting them broad flexibility in various payments they are obliged to pay." (Gili Cohen)
6:21 P.M. Saudi Arabia said Tuesday that Israel must reach a peace agreement with the Palestinians if it is to survive as a nation, and criticised Muslims for being divided and failing to stop Israel's military operation. "Israel has to realize that peace is the only solution for its survival," Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal told a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the world's largest Muslim body, on the situation in the Gaza Strip.
"As we see, Israel does not shy away from taking its terror to any level, with total disregard to any laws, rules, religious edicts or humanitarian considerations to achieve its goals. "Its only objective is to uproot the Palestinian existence wherever it is," Prince Saud told the meeting in Jeddah, attended by Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah and ministers from the 56-member OIC.
The veteran foreign minister also rejected Western backing of Israel's right to defend itself against Hamas rockets. "Israel does not have a right of self-defense as an occupier. There is no rule under international law that says an occupier has a right of self-defence. For any country to take that position shows bad intentions towards the region and bad intentions towards peace in the region," Prince Saud told a news conference after the OIC meeting.
"I don't think it's fair to equate the actions of Hamas and Israel, either in scale or in substance. How can you say that Israel has a right to defend itself when it is the occupier and you do not give the same right to Hamas?"
"Would it have been possible for Israel to carry out an aggression after another, had the Islamic nation been united?" Prince Saud said. "What tempts Israel to commit its continuous crimes against the Palestinian people and Muslims as a whole is the weakness it sees in the Muslim nation due to fragmentation and divisions and the spread of sedition within it." (Reuters)
5:23 P.M. The state responded to a petition to the High Court asking to order the declaration of Operation Protective Edge as a war, and not just a military operation. The state says the petition, which would have serious financial consequences, should be rejected. Defining Protective Edge as a war would require the state to pay compensation, estimated at billions of shekels, to businesses or workers who suffered financially during the operation. (Revital Hovel)
5:15 P.M. "Operation Protective Edge is not over yet, but without a doubt, Hamas and the rest of the terrorist organizations in Gaza have suffered a hard blow," says Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon during a visit to the Israel Navy base in Ashdod. He adds, "If I totaled the hits and damage caused to them, they would exceed those caused in operations Pillar of Defense, Cast Lead and the Second Lebanon War." (Gili Cohen)
4:54 P.M. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is working to gain the support of cabinet ministers for the long-term cease-fire proposal in the Gaza Strip that is currently being negotiated by Israel and Hamas with Egyptian mediation. According to a senior Israeli official, after Netanyahu canceled the cabinet meeting that was supposed to take place today, he summoned Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, Communications Minister Gilad Erdan, Justice Minister Tzipi Livni and Economy Minister Naftali Bennett for private meetings. At the meetings, Netanyahu is likely to present the ministers with the cease-fire proposal that is being shaped, and try to convince them to support it. (Barak Ravid)
5:02 P.M. The International Tennis Federation board of directors has rejected an appeal by the Israel Tennis Association to move a September 12-14 World Group playoff match against Argentina that was meant to take place in Israel because of the conflict in Gaza. The Davis Cup match was to have been held in Tel Aviv. The board meanwhile accepted an appeal asking to move a match from Ukraine that was submitted by Belgium. Ukraine can suggest a neutral location, SBS reported. Israel can nominate an alternative location in another country by Thursday.
2:39 P.M. The Israel Navy fired into the air after an engine boat began exiting the from the Gaza coast in the Rafah area. The IDF said that the shots were part of its distancing procedure, and that the boat returned to shore immediately thereafter. There were no injuries. The IDF has prevented Gazan boats from leaving the coast since the beginning of Operation Protective Edge. (Gili Cohen)
1:32 P.M. Turkish activists from the Freedom Flotilla Coalition said Tuesday it planned to sail to Gaza "during 2014." It did not specify how many vessels would participate, but said the flotilla was "a reflection of the growing worldwide solidarity with the Palestinian people."
It said it will also organize demonstrations in ports worldwide in coming months.
The group organized two previous flotillas, in 2010 and in 2011.During the first, Israeli forces stormed the Turkish boat Mavi Marmara, killing nine people on board. The incident led to a breakdown in Turkish-Israeli relations. (AP)
12:20 P.M. William Schabas, the head of the UN commission of inquiry into war crimes in Gaza, rejects claims that he is anti-Israel in an interview with Channel 2. He further asserts that he won't let his views affect his ability to reach impartial and fair conclusions.
10:59 A.M. Palestinian sources said Tuesday that the cease-fire would likely be extended by another 72 hours, due to lack of progress on a number of issues under discussion in Cairo. The sources added, however, that if progress was not reached in the next few hours, there would be no point in extending the truce.
"The first cease-fire did not achieve anything," Hamas' deputy political leader, Moussa Abu-Marzouk said. "This cease-fire will be the second and the last." Abu Marzouk said that the talks so far were difficult, but contained "signs of seriousness." Hamas has not conceded on any of its demands, Abu Marzouk added, including the openings of border crossing and the construction of a port.
Palestinian sources said the gaps were still large, due in part to the sides' different readings of the understandings stipulated in the outline. On the issue of border crossings, for example, the Palestinians have accused Israel of trying to formalize the blockade by easing conditions but not lifting the siege. (Zvi Bar'el)
10:25 A.M. A Palestinian is moderately wounded by IDF gunfire after throwing firebombs in Qalqilyah. (Gili Cohen)
8:25 A.M. Israeli ministers are informed that a cabinet meeting on the truce talks, scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, has been canceled. The announcement was made shortly after senior Israeli officials briefed the media on the gaps in the negotiations in Cairo. (Barak Ravid)
8:07 A.M. A senior Israeli official says no progress has been made in the talks between Israel and the Palestinians, and that the large gaps remain to be bridged between the sides. (Barak Ravid)
01:31 A.M. British-Lebanese attorney Amal Alamuddin released a statement on Monday night saying that she will not be serving on the United Nations Human Rights Commission inquiry into the war in Gaza.
"There are various reports published today stating that I have been appointed as one of the three members of the UN Commission of Inquiry for Gaza," Alamuddin said in the statement.
"I am horrified by the situation in the occupied Gaza Strip, particularly the civilian causalities that have been caused, and strongly believe that there should be an independent investigation and accountability for crimes that have been committed."
However, she said, she had decided to turn down the offer of a seat on the commission "given existing commitments—including eight ongoing cases.
"I wish my colleagues who will serve on the commission courage and strength in their endeavors."
01:03 A.M. Israel has agreed to substantially ease conditions in the Gaza Strip during the Cairo cease-fire talks, a senior official in Jerusalem said yesterday.
While no final agreement has been reached, Israel is prepared to ease conditions in a number of areas beyond those agreed to after Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, Israeli officials said.The security cabinet is to meet this afternoon in the prime minister's bureau in Jerusalem to discuss progress in the Egyptian-brokered negotiations in Cairo for a long-term stable cease-fire between Israel and the Palestinian factions.
The Israeli delegation to the Cairo talks spent yesterday in Cairo and returned to Israel in the evening, at which point they reported to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon on the details of the talks. Barak Ravid, Zvi Bar'el)

A lawsuit was filed Friday aiming to block a Dec. 9 referendum on thepassed Aug. 20 by the FThe ordinance provides for penalties against discrimination against people on a variety of grounds — including gender and race, but the addition of protection for gay people from housing and employment discrimination triggered a petition drive for a referendum. Conservative church groups and the anti-gay Family Council have led the fight to protect legal discrimination against gay people.The lawsuit, with Kristin Higgins of Fayetteville as a plaintiff, says, among others, that the petitions were filed a day after 31 days allowed by law to call a referendum. Counting the day the ordinance was passed, the deadline was Sept. 19, the lawsuit contends, and petitions were filed the next day. The lawsuit also said the petitions did not bear the revised versions of the ordinance approved by the City Council and failed in other ways to comply with state law on referendums. It also alleged irregularities in signatures found valid by the county clerk because canvassers didn't attest to residences and some of those approved have residences outside of Fayetteville.The suit also notes the dispute that emerged this week in which the County Election Commission decided voters should cast ballots for or against repeal of the ordinance. The suit contends this is confusing and misleading. The lawsuit contends the state law requires that votes on referred ordinances be for or against the ordinance itself.. The lawsuit notes the county clerk made additions and deletions to the list of signatures she'd certified as valid after the certification decision was issued. And the lawsuit says signatures were dated after the date they were notarized, evidence of fraud in the process.The suit asks that certification of the petitions by Clerk Sondra Smith be voided. If the special election is held, the votes shouldn't be counted, the suit says.Jeff Priebe and Deborah Riordan of Little Rock are attorneys in the lawsuit.

A newly discovered planetary system orbiting a sunlike star may conceal a rare super-Earth, according to data from NASA's Kepler space telescope.
Launched last March, Kepler was designed to look for extrasolar planets, aka exoplanets, via transits—the periodic dimming of light from stars due to planets passing in front them, as seen from the telescope's vantage point. (Read about Kepler's first planet discoveries.)
After analyzing seven months' worth of data from Kepler, a team led by Matt Holman of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics found two transiting exoplanets orbiting the star Kepler-9, which lies about 2,300 light-years from Earth.
One of the planets, dubbed Kepler-9b, takes just over 19 days to orbit its star. The other, Kepler-9c, takes almost 39 days to complete an orbit. (Find out how exoplanets get their names.)
The researchers noticed that both planets' orbital periods speed up and slow down at regular intervals. This means the two planets are locked in gravitational "resonance"—so that each planet's gravity is affecting the other's orbit.
Using that data, the scientists were able to calculate the masses of the planets, and they found that both worlds are slightly less massive than Saturn.
Newfound Planet System Includes a Hot Earth?
When the astronomers accounted for the amount of stellar dimming the two planets should cause, they found another, faint source of interference.
This signal could mean that a third planet, smaller and nearer to the host star, is transiting Kepler-9 every 1.6 days. The third planet would be about 1.5 times the mass of Earth and made of rocks rather than gas.
But the researchers aren't celebrating just yet—interference from background stars or stellar companions can look a lot like the signals of transiting exoplanets.
"At this point, we have a very, very interesting candidate, and I hope soon we may be able to see something more," Holman said. (Read about the search for new Earths in National Geographic magazine.)
And even if the unknown object turns out to be a super-Earth, humans won't likely be colonizing it: Based on its tight orbit, the planet's surface temperature would be about 2,200 Kelvin (3,500 degrees F, or 1,900 degrees C).

Real-Time Garbage Collection Is Real
Real-Time Garbage Collection (RTGC) tests the limits of what we typically think is possible in production software. You might hear “Real-Time” and “Garbage Collection” together and think “If you truly need real-time guarantees, why would you use garbage collected language?” or “How is real-time Garbage Collection even possible?” Or if you're like me, you might even want to know “What is Real-Time?” It turns out that RTGC is very real, and research on it is very active. If you want to learn more, there is fantastic coverage of the subject in Jones et al's The Garbage Collection Handbook, which heavily influenced the writing of this post: unless otherwise noted, quotes are from Jones.[5]
This post is a brief introduction to the concepts of RTGC with a focus on how the work in such a system is scheduled. Along the way, the casual observer can maybe learn a lesson about the ever-present trade-offs that stretch our limits as programmers and thinkers, and make insane ideas like RTGC possible.
What is Real-Time?
Since Garbage Collected languages have conquered the enterprise and are thoroughly mainstream, their benefits are desired in real-time scenarios. These days, Real-Time Garbage Collected software can be found running everywhere from dedicated server applications to embedded devices.[6] In order to be able to discuss some interesting aspects of implementing RTGC, it would be helpful to have some definitions. Here are a few key terms:
Garbage Collection (GC) is a form of Automatic Memory Management which gives a program the appearance of infinite memory by reclaiming allocated objects which are no longer in use. The implementation details of GC include how memory is allocated, stored and referred to during program execution, and eventually reclaimed and freed.
(GC) is a form of Automatic Memory Management which gives a program the appearance of infinite memory by reclaiming allocated objects which are no longer in use. The implementation details of GC include how memory is allocated, stored and referred to during program execution, and eventually reclaimed and freed. A real-time system is “a hardware or software system that is subject to deadlines from event to system response.” Some soft real-time systems such as video displays can tolerate the occasional failure; a dropped frame isn't the end of the world. There are also hard real-time systems such as those running internal combustion engines, which rightly consider even one missed deadline a total system failure: missing a deadline can mean damaging an engine.

The mutator is the part of a running program which executes application code, so called because “from the collector's point of view it simply mutates the graph of objects”

is the part of the running program which handles the duties of GC Mutator utilization is the “fraction of CPU time used by the mutator, as opposed to by the collector”
With those in place, Real-Time Garbage Collection is Automatic Memory Management capable of:
Guaranteeing a certain amount of mutator utilization in a given time window
Accounting precisely for all mutator interruptions
Ensuring that space bounds are not exceeded
Which is a pretty amazing feat, even once you understand that RTGC isn't a magical formula that somehow makes the trade-offs present in regular GC go away. In order to put a finer point on the requirements listed above, consider the following illustration of program execution and GC behavior:
Mutator (white) and Collector (non-white) timings
during normal execution and two GC runs.
Top: Stop the World, Middle: Incremental, Bottom: Real-Time [3]
The top band shows two long GC pauses which reflect normal behavior of Stop the World GC such as vanilla Mark-and-Sweep. While the pauses appear consistent, they are each too long. For this reason, RTGC is not often pursued in a non-incremental context: it is too difficult to keep pause times below a desired threshold. The middle band, which shows shorter but more irregular GC pauses over two collections, illustrates a normal incremental GC such as a Baker copying collector. While the lengths are better, the pauses are simply too irregular. This prompted Jones to say, in the last chapter of a textbook which covers every classic and most well-known modern collectors:
“…as real-time systems are now understood, none of the previous algorithms live up to the promise of supporting true real-time behavior.”
The bottom band above shows ideal behavior for RTGC. Pauses are short and regularly spaced out - in a word, predictable. I was drawn to this means of visualizing GC behavior by the authors of a very interesting approach to RTGC, known as The Metronome.[1] [3] The algorithm is interesting for a number of reasons, but I found one detail particularly striking, as a tweak to the algorithm is made in an area not often explored in GC. The authors suggest that a different means of scheduling the collector execution is key to guaranteeing sufficient mutator utilization.
Scheduling Real-Time Garbage Collection
In order to satisfy the guarantees described above, RTGC algorithms need to pay special attention to how the collector will be called to do its work. There are three primary ways of describing how RTGC can schedule the work for its collector:
Work based scheduling executes small amounts of collector work each time the mutator does work
executes small amounts of collector work each time the mutator does work Slack based scheduling runs the collector when the mutator is not working
runs the collector when the mutator is not working Time based scheduling periodically schedules and runs the collector according to an interval
The Metronome authors made some headway in the area of RTGC scheduling. As they state:
“We show both analytically and experimentally that time-based scheduling is superior, particularly at the short intervals that are typically of interest in real-time systems. Work-based algorithms may achieve short individual pause times, but are unable to achieve consistent utilization.” [2]
I found this to be fascinating - it's true that work and slack based scheduling approaches can provide predictably short pause times, but they do not have the ability to make the decision to also guarantee an acceptable amount of mutator utilization. Jones brings up another very interesting paper, A hard look at hard real-time garbage collection where the author concurs:
“I see a growing consensus that time-based methods, in which the garbage collector is treated as a separate task in the real-time scheduling problem, allow more realistic timing analysis of the real-time code, by decreasing GC “taxes” on mutator operations.” [4]
That's just how the Metronome functions when it is run with the time-based scheduler. During programming execution, many times per second, a heartbeat runs which causes the system to schedule small units of collector work if necessary. The algorithm can target a particular percentage of mutator utilization and guarantee that it will be preserved over a sliding window, scheduling even sized slices of time for either the mutator or the collector.
A Trade-Off and a Send-Off
Just to remind you that I'm not lying, Real-Time Garbage Collection is real, and this is not magical: there are trade-offs to be made. In order to be able to provide a consistently scheduled amount of memory, we have to ease off on our requirements for space bounds - our running programs may exceed the amount of space we want them to take (but not the amount of space that we estimate they could possibly take).
While reading the literature about RTGC, I was struck again and again by how the basic principles that non real-time software developers operate by are invalid in a world of such strict guarantees. In order to consider deploying real-time code, an enormous amount of testing, measurement, prediction, proof, etc. has to occur. The Garbage Collector can operate with the knowledge that it can expect a consistent amount of work, within a reasonable degree. Jones points out that work-based scheduling can guarantee our requirements as long as the amount of work done can be properly estimated. Time-based scheduling can provide stronger time guarantees but will have to use more space during times of heavy use if the system is not expecting it. Trade-offs. Always trade-offs.

After Utrecht, another Dutch town is joining the basic income social experiment to see whether receiving an unconditional sum of money each month will make society more productive or slacking.
The second city in Holland to join the experiment is Tilburg, a city numbering 200,000 inhabitants found near the border with Belgium. For now, however, only 250 people will participate in the pilot program which will see each person receiving a monthly check ranging from €900 ($1,000) to €1,300 ($1,450). It's important to note that each participant is currently on welfare, but by being included in this program the previous welfare conditions don't apply anymore. This means no meetings, no paperwork, no job hunting. Free cash each month, no strings attached.
Why would a government do this? Well, working just to support yourself is definitely not good for you, as a person, nor for society. A bad job is worse for your mental health than unemployment, and an unsatisfied employee is unproductive to a company and society. So, instead of flipping burgers to support yourself on minimal wage, you could stay home or go back to school, learn a new skill – something you can really be good at – then get back to work. Or you can just stay at home, cash in and exploit the system. This latter scenario is what gets most people to criticize the basic income initiative, which is why pilot programs like these in Utrecht or Tilburg are very important to follow. The aim is: will this make the city more productive or will it backfire?
So far, there are reasons to believe the basic income works. A program ran in Ojivero-Omitara from January 2008 to December 2009 by the Namibia BIG Coalition found decrease in poverty, an increase in economic activity, reduced crime, reduced child malnutrition and increased school attendance as well as other positive effects after basic income was introduced. Two pilot programs launched in India (2010) resulted in an “increase in economic activity as well as an increase in savings, an improvement in housing and sanitation, improved nutrition, less food poverty, improved health and schooling, greater inclusion of the disabled in society and a lack of frivolous spending.”
As early as 1795, American revolutionary Thomas Paine called for a Citizen's Dividend to all U.S. citizens for “loss of his or her natural inheritance, by the introduction of the system of landed property.” Napoleon Bonaparte echoed this liberal idea, being quoted as saying”man is entitled by birthright to a share of the Earth's produce sufficient to fill the needs of his existence.” Today, there are some places where this has been applied – sharing dividends with the citizens. For instance, in Alaska, each citizen receives roughly $1,200 annually as a rightful share of the profit made from oil in the state. Far too little to live on, unfortunately.
The simple fact is that not all people have to work. Sure, most people work because they have to survive, but if working just for the sake of buying groceries and paying rent is put out of the equation what kind of progress could society see? It's a highly interesting prospect, and yes I believe it could actually work. Moreover, a couple of decades from now it will have to work. As more and more tasks and skillsets become automated, as many as half of all current jobs will disappear in the coming decades. Many will get new jobs – jobs that don't exist yet, not at a mainstream level at least – but most won't have the time to re-purpose their skill set. In a recent interview, this is what Edward Snowden thought of this particular issue:
“As a technologist, I see the trends, and I see that automation inevitably is going to mean fewer and fewer jobs. And if we do not find a way to provide a basic income for people who have no work, or no meaningful work, we're going to have social unrest that could get people killed. When we have increasing production—year after year—some of that needs to be reinvested in society. It doesn't need to be consistently concentrated in these venture-capital funds and things like that.”
But until our robot overloads take over, who's going to flip burgers, serve meals, drive the school bus and so on if everybody has a basic income? Well, people will still want to get a job because: a) contrary to what most would think (hey, even you), people actually get bored and want careers and b) the basic income will be designed to cover your minimal expenses; if you want to party each weekend, travel or buy gadgets you'll still have to find a job. It's just that, with a basic income you don't have to stress that you'll end up on the streets or that you don't have anything to put on the table for your kinds the next day. Poverty hurts.
In all event, it will be very interesting to follow events in Holland. Soon, the cities of Groningen, Maastricht, Gouda, Enschede, Nijmegen and Wageningen might also join.

The U.S. attorney's office has scheduled a noon news conference that it said would deal with "charges being filed in a political corruption matter and a case involving a massive healthcare fraud scheme."
A law enforcement source with knowledge of the case said the announcement will involve the yearlong investigation into Calderon (D-Montebello).
GRAPHIC: Calderon family connections
An affidavit obtained last year by Al Jazeera America includes allegations that Ronald Calderon accepted $88,000 in bribes from an undercover FBI agent and a businessman to affect legislation to extend film-industry tax credits and to change workers' compensation laws.
The document also said there was also probable cause to believe that Ronald Calderon "participated in a separate bribery scheme with Michael D. Drobot," the chief executive officer of Pacific Hospital of Long Beach. The lawmaker allegedly accepted $28,000 from Drobot in exchange for "supporting legislation that would delay or limit changes in California's workers' compensation laws," the affidavit said.
The Times has also reported that the FBI investigation has looked into the Central Basin Municipal Water District, where Calderon's brother Tom worked as a consultant.
Both Calderons have denied wrongdoing.
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to provide specifics about the charges but said several people faced criminal charges in the matter.
Last Friday's resolution in the United Nations Security Council urging a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip passed 14-0, with the abstention of the United States. The abstention came after President Bush sent last minute orders to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who worked hard winning support for the watered down resolution only to not vote in favor of it. The move surprised virtually everybody, who assumed the US was going to vote in favor.
But where did Bush's orders come from? If you believe Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, it came from him. Olmert claims to have called President Bush, demanded to speak to him even though he was in the process of giving a lecture, and ordered him to stop Rice from voting in favor of the deal. Olmert seemed quite pleased with himself, adding that his move embarrassed Rice.
The State Department has denied the report, of course, and sparked something of a war of words between Prime Minister Olmert and Secretary Rice. Israeli newspaper Haaretz did some digging into the reports, and found that Rice had indeed told her French and British counterparts she was “on board” for the resolution, only to be thwarted by the last minute phone call. In their denials US officials insisted they had intended to abstain all along, bolstering Olmert's case that something, namely him, changed Bush's stance at the last minute.

Bachelor's Grove Cemetery
Bachelor's Grove Cemetery is a cemetery in Bremen Township, Cook County, Illinois, in Chicago's southwest suburbs, known for its alleged ghost sightings. The cemetery has also been called Bachelor Grove, Batchelor Grove, Batchelder's Grove, and Everden (or Everdon).
Location [ edit ]
Bachelors Grove Cemetery is just northwest of Midlothian and Oak Forest, near the Rubio Woods Forest Preserve on the Midlothian Turnpike (near its intersection with Central Avenue), in the southwest Chicago suburbs.[1][2]
Background [ edit ]
The land surrounding Bachelors Grove Cemetery was originally settled by English homesteaders who relocated to the area from New England, including Stephen Rexford, arguably the most well known of the first wave of Anglo settlers, around 1833.[3] Ursula Bielski, author of "Chicago Haunts," asserts the actual cemetery was originally named the Everdon Cemetery after the original holder of the property title, Samuel Everdon. The site saw its first official burials around 1840 and contains 82 plots, many of which were never sold or used.[4] Burials, however, possibly go back as far as 1834, when German immigrant workers killed while working on the Illinois and Michigan Canal were reportedly laid to rest at the site.[5] The site is often reported to have been a dumping ground for victims of Chicago's organized crime families of the 1920s and 1930s (including Al Capone), but no evidence of this has been proven.[5]
Reported phenomena [ edit ]
The most common of the reported phenomena at the site typically involves floating orbs of light over tombstones and near collisions with a phantom vehicle.[5][6]
Specific manifestations reported [ edit ]
Besides orbs and phantom vehicles, there have been additional reports of supernatural events at the cemetery, including:[5]
The white lady (or "white madonna")– she walks the grounds carrying an infant during the full moon. [5]
Phantom farmhouse– a ghostly farmhouse which is purported to shimmer, float, and then vanish; [5] [7] this was most often reported during the 1950s. There are also reports by witnesses of the house shrinking as they approach it, then disappearing altogether. [6]
this was most often reported during the 1950s. There are also reports by witnesses of the house shrinking as they approach it, then disappearing altogether. A farmer and his plow-horse– both victims of a plowing accident, dragged to their deaths into the nearby slough.
A two-headed ghost– near the same slough.
Religious monks– as late as 1984, witnesses reported seeing numerous figures dressed in monk's robes throughout the cemetery. [5] [6]
A black dog– witnesses in the 1990s reported seeing this manifestation at the cemetery's entrance; it would disappear when they approached it. [6]
The "woman sitting on the grave"– a notable photograph which ran in the Chicago Sun-Times, purportedly showing a transparent woman sitting on a tombstone; the apparition was not visible when the photograph was taken. [5]
Phantom cars- Many visitors have reported hearing & seeing ghost cars on a nearby road
Paranormal investigations [ edit ]
Claims of hauntings peaked in the 1970s and 1980s.[6]
Paranormal researchers James Houran, Timothy Harte, Michael Hollinshead and Ursula Bielski conducted a series of experiments at Bachelors Grove Cemetery in the 1980s and 1990s. One of these, a photography experiment, was published in the Journal of Perceptual and Motor Skills (1997) and found that, while no anomalous images were obtained from Bachelors Grove Cemetery, approximately half of the frames on both infrared and black and white films were unexposed. The results are discussed in terms of ambiguous events being interpreted as meaningful due to paranormal contexts.[8]
The Ghost Research Society has conducted numerous investigations into the reported phenomenon, and their results have included images which contain light resembling ectoplasm as well as orbs.[6][9]
One photograph, taken by Judy Huff Felz in 1991, includes a "supposed" full image of a ghostly figure.[6][10] Researchers have reported electronic voice phenomena in the area.[6]
In 2012, the cemetery was featured on an episode of Ghost Adventures.

AC Milan forward Jeremy Menez has undergone surgery to correct a slipped disc in his back.
The operation was to relieve a recurrent problem emanating from the player's back, with the objective being to have Menez back up and running in time for pre-season.
The French international was operated on this morning in Monte Carlo, where Professor Bernard Massini, the same surgeon used for a similar injury three years ago performed the routine procedure, a club statement confirmed.
A rest period of around three weeks is believed to be required before the 28-year-old can resume strenuous physical activity.
Menez has recently dispelled rumours linking him with a move away from the Rossoneri by revealing he is content to be at the club and is looking forward to future success with the Serie A giants.
Milan are apparently planning a major rebuild of their playing squad during the summer following the €480 million investment from Thai businessman Bee Taechaubol, with around €150m being made available for transfers.
The former Roma winger scored 16 league goals during the 2014/15 campaign, ending the season as Milan's top goalscorer despite the Diavolo's poor season.
The drain on Medicaid funding would worsen over time under the bill that Senate Republicans are working to pass, with the new funding limits starting in 2021 and having the biggest impact more than a decade from now. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that Medicaid spending would be 26 percent lower under the Senate plan than it would be under current law in 2026 — and 35 percent lower in 2036. The office predicted that states would be forced to “eliminate optional services, restrict eligibility for enrollment or adopt some combination of those approaches.”
Under the Senate plan, states would receive a fixed annual amount for each Medicaid beneficiary, with each category of beneficiaries, like children and the disabled, getting a different base amount based on recent costs. The amount would increase every year by a formula that is expected to grow more slowly than average medical costs after 2025. Disabled children would not be subject to the spending caps.
Avalere Health, a consulting firm, estimated in a report that federal spending on individual state Medicaid programs could decline between 6 percent and 26 percent under the Republican plan by 2026. The biggest drops would be in states that expanded Medicaid, but the cuts would compound more sharply for every state in later years.
Conservatives say Medicaid spending, which consumes a major and growing portion of the federal and states' budgets, needs to be reined in. The current system of unlimited federal matching funds, they say, has encouraged states to milk as much as they can, sometimes wastefully; capping funding, their argument goes, would make Medicaid more efficient and ensure it can continue to help the most vulnerable Americans, including people with disabilities.
“The fiscal sustainability of Medicaid is essential to making sure that those who depend on the program can know it will be there for them in the future,” Avik Roy, a conservative health care analyst, wrote last week in Forbes.

Two sailors who were shooting pellet guns were taken into custody at Naval Base Point Loma after a person mistook the guns as real, prompting parts of the base to shelter in place Thursday, a Navy spokesman said.
A person reported seeing a sailor brandishing what they thought was a weapon at the base on Rosecrans Street about 10 a.m., base spokesman Lt. Commander Steve Ruh said. No gunshots were reported.
Base security and a multi-agency task force were notified of the incident, which includes Naval Criminal Investigative Service, Naval security forces, FBI SWAT members and San Diego police, Ruh said. A shelter-in-place order was also issued for parts of the base, a Navy spokesman said. A lock down was never in place.
Authorities determined where the sailor who was seen lived. Following a phone call from his Master Chief, the sailor and another sailor were taken into custody without incident, Ruh said. They are both junior enlisted personnel.
The sailors explained they were shooting two pellet guns at a mirror on a parking garage wall from their barracks room, Ruh said. Evidence of the pellet gun shooting was found in the garage. Base policy prohibits the possession of pellet guns.
“We train for these things,” Ruh said. “The safety and security of the personnel on this instillation is our top priority. We conduct annual training for an active shooter drill and periodic training which allowed our first responders to resolve the situation without incident.”
The sailors were still in custody about 3 p.m.
Zhang Ruifang, 101, of Henan province in China, appears to have a horn growing on the left side of her forehead. Another is reportedly sprouting on the right side, according to the Daily Mail. I know, I know, the Daily Mail... but look at that horn. Just look at it. From the Daily Mail:
Although, it is unknown what the protrusion is on Mrs Zhang's head, it resembles a cutaneous horn.
This is a funnel-shaped growth and although most are only a few millimetres in length, some can extend a number of inches from the skin.
Cutaneous horns are made up of compacted keratin, which is the same protein we have in our hair and nails, and forms horns, wool and feathers in animals.
They usually develop in fair-skinned elderly adults who have a history of significant sun exposure but it is extremely unusual to see it form protrusions of this size.
The growths are most common in elderly people, aged between 60 and the mid-70s. They can sometimes be cancerous but more than half of cases are benign.
For people with diabetes, the right workout does so much more than blast fat and improve stamina.

It's no secret that exercise is a vital component of a healthy lifestyle. For people with type 2 diabetes, however, it could be a life-changing part of their treatment plan. Those are the findings of a new study from the University of Turku that assessed the health impact of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on both healthy people and people with diabetes.
In the study, published April 10 in Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports, the healthy men (all in their 40s and 50s) undertook a two-week training program consisting of either HIIT or traditional, moderate intensity training. A group of people with insulin resistance (some had type 2 diabetes and some had prediabetes, meaning their blood sugar levels were elevated but not yet high enough to indicate type 2 diabetes) completed a similar two-week fitness routine.
“Before the training started, the glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity of the insulin resistant people were significantly reduced compared to the group of healthy individuals,” says doctoral candidate Tanja Sjöros, as reported in Science Daily. “However, already after two weeks of high intensity training, which amounted to six training sessions, the glucose metabolism in the thigh muscles achieved the starting level of the healthy control group.”
It's important to increase blood glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in diabetics to avoid damage to the nerves and blood vessels, which can lead to complications such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-limb amputations.
Glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity improved after both the high-intensity training and the moderate intensity continuous training, suggesting that both are helpful, even though HIIT is definitely more effective. “The group that did moderate intensity training achieved only half of the improvement experienced by the HIIT group during the two-week period. Therefore, this type of training requires a longer period of time. If you have only little time to spare, high-interval training could be a great alternative to traditional training that requires more time but is lower in intensity,” says Sjöros.
Leading New York cardiologist Jennifer Haythe, MD, welcomed the results. “This is an important study demonstrating the benefits of high intensity interval training (HIIT) on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetics,” she says. “Unlike type 1 diabetics who have an absence of endogenous insulin, type 2 diabetics have impaired insulin sensitivity leading to delayed and inadequate uptake and metabolism of glucose. The fact that HIIT can actually improve insulin uptake and sensitivity is terrific news for Type 2 diabetics. In addition, HIIT improved endurance. This is just more evidence that exercise, in this case HIIT, improves health and wellness, and can actually work like medication in patients with DM2.”

Tainan Mayor William Lai (賴清德) of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has maintained his place as the best-performing head of a local government and also has the highest public approval rating, according to an annual survey published by CommonWealth Magazine yesterday.
In the performance ratings, Lai scored 79.06 out of 100 points, followed by Lienchiang County Commissioner Liu Tseng-ying (劉增應) of the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT), DPP Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu (陳菊), DPP Yilan County Commissioner Lin Tsung-hsien (林聰賢) and DPP Penghu County Commissioner Chen Kuang-fu (陳光復).
Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲), an independent who has been in the media spotlight since his election in November last year, was ranked ninth among the 22 city and county heads, according to the survey.
Ko said the survey indicated that there was still room for him to improve.
New Taipei Mayor Eric Chu (朱立倫) of the KMT fell in the rankings from 15th last year to 20th this year in the wake of the explosion at a water park in the city in June, which left 11 people dead and hundreds injured.
The performance rankings are based on public opinion and the views of experts, comprising 80 percent and 20 percent respectively. In the public approval segment of the survey, Lai, who has been boycotting city council meetings for eight months in protest against alleged vote buying by the Tainan council speaker in last year's local elections, received a public approval rating of 88.1 percent, the highest among all the city and county heads.
However, that marked a 2.4 percentage point decline from last year, which the magazine attributed to strong public opposition to a rail project in the city. The survey was conducted before the sharp escalation of dengue fever in the city over the past two weeks, the magazine said.
Lai said he appreciated the support of Tainan residents and that the poll showed his city government team had not relaxed its efforts in his second term.
In other cities and counties, some newly elected local government heads gained significantly higher public approval ratings than their predecessors, the magazine said.
Keelung Mayor Lin You-chang of the DPP's (林右昌) approval rating was 53.3 percent, almost twice as high his predecessor, Chang Tung-jung (張通榮), the magazine said.
Nantou County Commissioner Lin Ming-chen (林明溱) of the KMT and Taichung Mayor Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍) of the DPP, whose performance rankings were 16th and 17th, respectively, also had higher public approval ratings than their predecessors, the magazine said.
Some 80 members of Iraq's Yazidi minority have been massacred by Islamic State militants in a village in Iraq's north, Kurdish officials said.
“They arrived in vehicles and they started their killing this afternoon,” senior Kurdish official Hoshiyar Zebari told Reuters. “We believe it's because of their creed: convert or be killed.”
In addition to the murders, local women were kidnapped from the village, another Kurdish official source told Reuters. A local Yazidi lawmaker confirmed the information.
According to BasNews, a Kurdish website, it was the Yazidi minority village of Kojo some 20 km south of Sinjar that came under attack by the Islamic State (former ISIS) radicals.
BasNews reports that around 80 men – the village's whole male population – was slaughtered, while all the women were kidnapped.
The killings in the village lasted for about an hour, according to eyewitness reports, based on the testimony of Yazidi MP Mahama Khalil who spoke to survivors. Apparently, the massacre followed a five day ultimatum to convert to Islam or die.
“[An IS fighter] told me that the Islamic State had spent five days trying to persuade villagers to convert to Islam and that a long lecture was delivered about the subject today,” Reuters quotes a man from a neighbouring village as saying. “He then said the men were gathered and shot dead. The women and girls were probably taken to Tal Afar because that is where the foreign fighters are.”
The ISIS fighters – known for torture, public punishments and executions of those opposing them – have gained significant ground in both Syria and Iraq after its initial assault on the city of Mosul in mid-June. The group has since declared the creation of an Islamic State, or caliphate, straddling the Iraq-Syria border.
Its presence continues to hang over the Iraqi capital Baghdad, although it seems to have halted after capturing key Sunni areas. Islamic State has also been gaining ground in the autonomous region of Kurdistan.
Last week it was reported that extremists from the Islamic State killed at least 500 people, including women and children, Iraqi officials said. Some of the victims were buried alive.

The threat posed by the militant offensive sent an estimated 130,000 of Iraqis, many of them Yazidis, fleeing for their lives. They were seeking refuge in Iraqi Kurdistan, where Kurd militias have been battling with the Islamic State for weeks.
Around 40,000 Yazidis according to UN estimates have been stranded in several locations on Mount Sinjar in north of Iraq, where food and water are scarce.

Meanwhile on Friday, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution freezing the assets and imposing an arms embargo and travel ban on six of ISIS jihadists.
The resolution stated that the UNSC “deplores and condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist acts of ISIL (Islamic State) and its violent extremist ideology, and its continued gross, systematic and widespread abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law,” adding that those who finance, recruit or supply weapons to the insurgents might be sanctioned as well.
The list includes the group's spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnan and Abdul Mohsen Abdallah Ibrahim al-Charekh of Saudi Arabia from the Nusra Front in Syria.
Jon Hamm and Rashida Jones are also playing tag.
Isla Fisher has joined the all-star cast of the New Line comedy Tag.
The actress will team with Ed Helms, Jeremy Renner, Jake Johnson, Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Annabelle Wallis and Rashida Jones for the film, which is set to begin shooting later this month in Atlanta.
Tag is based on a true story featured in The Wall Street Journal about a group of friends who have been playing a no-holds-barred version of the children's game Tag for the last 30 years. Mark Steilen and Rob McKittrick penned the script.
Fisher will play Helms' wife, who is the brains behind this latest and most important tag game in the men's lives.
Jeff Tomsic is directing the pic, which is being produced by Todd Garner, Mark Steilen and Sean Robins.
Tag is slated for a June 29, 2018, release.
Fisher last starred with Hamm in Fox's Keeping Up With the Joneses and was part of the high-wattage cast of Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals. She is repped by UTA and Sloane Offer.
Nobody understands the GIL - Part 2: Implementation
Published on June 14, 2013 by Jesse Storimer
Last time, I began wanting to take you on a deep dive into MRI to see how the GIL is implemented. But first, I wanted to make sure I was asking the right question. Part 1 formulated the question, but today we'll look for answers inside MRI itself. We'll go looking for that elusive creature they call the GIL
In the first draft of this post, I really emphasized the C code that underlies the GIL, showing as much of it as I could. But after a while, the message was drowning in the details. I went back and reworked things so that you now see less C code with more explanations and diagrams. But for the source code divers, I'll at least mention the C functions, so you can go track them down.
Last time on...
Part 1 left off asking these two questions:
Does the GIL guarantee that array << nil is atomic? Does the GIL guarantee that your Ruby code will be thread-safe?
The first question is answered by looking at the implementation, so let's start there.
This snippet was spinning us around last time:
array = [] 5 . times . map do Thread . new do 1000 . times do array << nil end end end . each ( & :join ) puts array . size
If you assume that Array is thread-safe, the expected result would be an Array with 5000 elements. Since Array isn't thread-safe, implementations like JRuby and Rubinius produce an unexpected result; something less than 5000. It's the interaction, and switching between, multiple threads that corrupted the underlying data.
MRI produces the expected result, but is it a fluke or a guarantee? Let's begin our technical deep dive with a snippet of Ruby code to study.
Thread . new do array << nil end
From the top
To study what happens with this snippet, we need to look at how a thread is spawned inside MRI. We'll mostly be looking at functions from the thread*.c files in MRI. There's lots of indirection in these files to support both the Windows and Posix thread APIs, but all of the functions we look at come from those source files.
The first underlying operation of Thread.new is to spawn a new native thread to back the Ruby thread. The C function that becomes the body of the new thread is called thread_start_func_2 . Here's a look at this function at a high-level.
There's a lot of boilerplate code here that you don't need to see. I highlighted the parts of the function that we care about. Near the top, this new thread acquires the GIL. Remember that this thread remains idle until it actually owns the GIL. Near the middle of the function, it calls the block that you pass to Thread.new . After wrapping things up, it releases the GIL and exits the native thread.
In our snippet, this new thread is spawned from the main thread. Given this, we can assume that the main thread is currently holding the GIL. This new thread will have to wait until the main thread releases it before it can continue.
Let's look at how that happens when this new thread tries to acquire the GIL.
static void gvl_acquire_common ( rb_vm_t * vm ) { if ( vm -> gvl . acquired ) { vm -> gvl . waiting ++ ; if ( vm -> gvl . waiting == 1 ) { rb_thread_wakeup_timer_thread_low (); } while ( vm -> gvl . acquired ) { native_cond_wait ( & vm -> gvl . cond , & vm -> gvl . lock ); }
This is a snippet from the gvl_acquire_common function. This function is called when our new thread tries to acquire the GIL.
First, it checks if the GIL is currently acquired. If it is, then it increments the waiting attribute of the GIL. With our snippet, this value should now be 1. The very next line checks to see if waiting is 1. It is, so the next line triggers a wakeup of a timer thread.
This timer thread is the secret sauce that keeps MRI's threading system humming along, and keeps any one thread from hogging the GIL. But before we jump too far ahead, let's illustrate the state of things with the GIL, then introduce this timer thread.
I've said a few times that an MRI thread is backed by a native OS thread. This is true, but this diagram suggests that each MRI thread is running in parallel on its native thread. The GIL prevents this. We need to draw in the GIL to make this more realistic.
When a Ruby thread wants to execute code in its native thread, it must first acquire the GIL. The GIL mediates access between a Ruby thread and its underlying native thread, severely reducing parallelism! In the previous diagram, the Ruby threads could execute code in their native threads in parallel. This second diagram is closer to reality for MRI, only one thread can hold the GIL at any given time, so parallel execution of code is completely disabled.
For the MRI core team, the GIL protects the internal state of the system. With a GIL, they don't require any locks or synchronization around the internal data structures. If two threads can't be mutating the internals at the same time, then no race conditions can occur.
For you, the developer, this will severely limit the parallelism you get from running your Ruby code on MRI.
The timer thread
I said that the timer thread is what keeps one thread from hogging the GIL. The timer thread is just a native thread that exists internally in MRI; it has no equivalent Ruby thread. The timer thread is started up when MRI starts up with the rb_thread_create_timer_thread function.
When MRI boots up and only the main thread is running, the timer thread sleeps. But remember, once one thread is waiting on the GIL, it wakes up the timer thread.
This is closer to how the GIL is implemented in MRI. Harking back to the snippet that kicked this off, the thread on the far right is the one we just spawned. Since it's the only thread waiting for the GIL, it wakes up the timer thread.
This timer thread is what keeps a thread from hogging the GIL. Every 100ms, the timer thread sets an interrupt flag on the thread currently holding the GIL using the RUBY_VM_SET_TIMER_INTERRUPT macro. It's important to note the details here because this will give us the clue as to whether or not array << nil is atomic.
If you're familiar with the concept of timeslices, this is very similar.
Every 100ms the timer thread sets an interrupt flag on the thread currently holding the GIL. Setting an interrupt flag doesn't actually interrupt the execution of the thread. If that were the case, we could be certain that array << nil was not atomic.
Handling the interrupt flag
Deep in a file called vm_eval.c is the code for handling Ruby method calls. It's responsible for setting up the context for a method call and calling the right function. At the end of a function called vm_call0_body , right before it returns the return value of the current method, these interrupts are checked.
If this thread's interrupt flag has been set, then it stops execution on the spot, before returning its value. Before executing any more Ruby code, the current thread will release the GIL and call sched_yield . sched_yield is a system function prompting the thread scheduler to schedule another thread. Once this has been done, this interrupted thread attempts to re-acquire the GIL, now having to wait for another thread to release it.
Oh hey, this answers our question. array << nil is atomic. Thanks to the GIL, all Ruby methods implemented in C are atomic.
So this example:
array = [] 5 . times . map do Thread . new do 1000 . times do array << nil end end end . each ( & :join ) puts array . size
is guaranteed to produce the expected result every time when run on MRI.
But keep in mind that this guarantee isn't spelled out in the Ruby code. If you take this code to another implementation with no GIL, it will produce an unexpected result. It's good to know what the GIL guarantees, but it's not a great idea to write code that depends on it. In doing so, you basically put yourself in a vendor lock-in situation with MRI.
Similarly, the GIL is not a public API. It has no documentation and no specification. There's Ruby code out there that implicitly depends on the GIL, but the MRI team has talked before about getting rid of the GIL or changing its semantics. For these reasons, you certainly don't want to be writing code that depends on the current behaviour of the GIL.
Non-native methods
All I've said so far is that array << nil is atomic. This is an easy one because you have the Array#<< method taking a parameter that is a constant. There's only one method invocation in this expression and it's implemented in C. If it's interrupted during its course, it will simply continue until finished, then release the GIL.
What about something like this?
array << User . find ( 1 )
Before the Array#<< method can execute, it must evaluate the expression on the right hand side so it can pass its value as a parameter. So User.find(1) has to be invoked first. And as you know, User.find(1) will call lots of other Ruby code inside its implementation.
So, methods implemented with Ruby code have no atomicity guarantees on MRI. Only methods implemented with native C code have this guarantee.
So, does that mean Array#<< is still atomic in the above example? Yes, but only once the right hand side has been evaluated. In other words, the User.find(1) method will be invoked with no atomicity guarantee. Then it's return value will be passed to Array#<< , which retains its atomicity guarantee.
Update: @headius wrote an excellent comment that expands on what guarantees the GIL provides. If you've read this far, consider it required reading!
What does it all mean?
The GIL makes method invocations atomic. What does this mean for you?
In part 1, I showed what could happen to an example C function when a context switch happened right in the middle of it. With a GIL, that situation is no longer possible. Rather, if that context switch were to happen, the other thread would remain idle waiting for the GIL, giving the current thread a chance to continue uninterrupted. This behaviour is only applicable when MRI implements the Ruby method in C.
This behaviour eliminates a host of race conditions that would otherwise happen inside MRI and need to be guarded against. From this perspective, the GIL is strictly an internal implementation detail of MRI. It keeps MRI safe.
But there's still a lingering question that wasn't answered. Does the GIL provide any guarantee that your Ruby code will be thread-safe?
This is an important question for anyone using MRI, and if you're familiar with multi-threaded programming in other environments, you probably already know that the answer is a resounding no. But this article is long enough, I address this question more thoroughly in part 3.
Rangers backup goalie Antti Raanta nearly recorded a shutout Sunday night in his first career appearance against the Lightning — Steven Stamkos deflected a shot past him at 16:36 of the third period in the Blueshirts' 6-1 win — but Raanta was pleased with the result.
“Our guys were lighting it up today,” said Raanta, who made 31 saves. “[Tampa Bay's] d-men like to shoot the puck, but I always had sight of it. If there was a rebound or something, our guys were helping me. They were blocking shots and making sacrifices. That's what we need if we're going to win.”
Coach Alain Vigneault said he “wasn't worried at all about Antti [against the potent Lightning]. The way he's played for us in the past, how hard he's working during practices and the extra work he's doing with [goaltending coach Benoit Allaire].”
Said Ryan McDonagh: “He was big, no question about it. He made some key saves, especially in the second. Hats off to him . . . He's been great ever since he joined the team.”
With five games in eight days beginning Tuesday night and eight games in 15 days, Raanta is sure to get more chances in November.
Center of attention
As Tampa Bay's defense pinched along the boards, the Rangers used the center of the ice and succeeded. “We found the middle a little bit more and just kind of chipped it over their heads, got into footraces and that allowed us to find some odd-man looks,” said McDonagh, whose assist on Michael Grabner's second goal was his eighth of the season. “We were able to finish, and that's a good sign.” . . . Before Grabner, the last Ranger to score a hat trick was Mats Zuccarello against Toronto on Oct. 30, 2015.

Kreider likely to play Tuesday night
It appears that Chris Kreider, who missed his fourth straight game Sunday night after developing neck spasms, will be ready to return Tuesday night when the Rangers face the St. Louis Blues.
Kreider, who was off to a hot start with three goals and four assists in the first five games before his injury, skated with the team at Madison Square Garden on Sunday morning.
“He looked fine out there,” coach Alain Vigneault said. “I'm confident he'll be good to go on Tuesday.” The plan is for Kreider to participate in a full practice Monday.
Kreider agreed to a four-year contract worth $4.625 million annually in July.
Clendening sits again
Defenseman Adam Clendening was a healthy scratch for the fourth straight game as Vigneault stuck with the same six defensemen, although he dropped Kevin Klein to the third pair, on the right side of Brady Skjei. Klein missed the first three games of the season because of a back sprain.
Klein blocked four shots and had three hits and three shots on goal against Carolina on Friday night but is a minus-2 and has no points in six games.
“Any time you have an injury,” Vigneault said, “you've got to do a little more to find your rhythm. For the most part, he's been all right. I'd like him to move the puck a little bit quicker, have a little more jump to that first step and that first pass. But he's doing what we expect from him.”
Busy week
With five games in eight nights — four against Western Conference teams and a back-to-back (in Boston on Saturday before hosting Winnipeg) — both Henrik Lundqvist and Antti Raanta “are going to play this week,” Vigneault said.
A day after he was detained and questioned at Heathrow Airport by custom officials for over eight hours, Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev claimed that the customs officials seized documents from him that carried corruption proof against the Congress, reported CNN-IBN.
"They took two diaries. Both were on corruption done by the UPA government," Ramdev said.
Ramdev said he was not given any explanation for the action by the authorities and claimed he was not involved in anything illegal.
"I have never done anything wrong or illegal in my life. I was detained for eight hours at the airport, but was not given any explanation. I asked them repeatedly to give me a reason for detention; but they told that they cannot disclose it to me," Ramdev said.
Ramdev's detention has drawn criticism from the BJP which urged the Centre to intervene. BJP President Rajnath Singh termed the detention of the yoga guru as "serious" issue and asked the Centre to take cognisance of the matter.
"The reasons for his detention have not been made public...as I know, he was detained at the airport for
carrying a diary carrying mantras. The diary has been seized and he has been called for fresh questioning today also," Singh told reporters in New Delhi.
There was lack of clarity over the reason for his detention at the airport.
Ramdev went to London to attend the function organised by the Patanjali Yogpeeth on the 120th anniversary of Swami Vivekananda in the next couple of days.
According to one of the organisers of the function, Ramdev was questioned on books he was carrying which were in Hindi and Sanskrit. The officials detained Ramdev for over six hours before he was allowed to go.
However, a source said, Ramdev was questioned by customs officials as he came here on a visitor visa instead of a business visa.
Some media reports also said that Ramdev was questioned about certain medicines he was carrying with him.
Ramdev's spokesman SK Tejarawala described as "baseless" that he was being questioned on carrying some medicines.

In December of 2006, Mexico's new President Felipe CalderÃ³n declared war on the drug cartels, reversing earlier government passiveness. Since then, the government has made some gains, but at a heavy price - gun battles, assasinations, kidnappings, fights between rival cartels, and reprisals have resulted in over 9,500 deaths since December 2006 - over 5,300 killed last year alone. President Barack Obama recently announced extra agents were being deployed to the border and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton heads to Mexico today to pursue a broad diplomatic agenda - overshadowed now by spiraling drug violence and fears of greater cross-border spillover. Officials on both sides of the border are committed to stopping the violence, and stemming the flow of drugs heading north and guns and cash heading south. ( 34 photos total
GETTY Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has urged donors to use cryptocurrencies
Mr Assange said potential donors can now use monero and zcash as well as bitcoin and litecoin payment options in an attempt to sidestep a “financial blockade”. He took to Twitter to complain about "politically induced financial censorship" that violated US donors' First Amendment rights and their right to freedom of association. Mr Assange, who has now spent eight years in exile in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, said: “US donors are the majority of our donor base.”

Eno will reissue four albums from the '90s in December
Ambient legend Brian Eno has unveiled a previously unheard song called ‘Prague'.
Eno recently announced that he'll re-release a series of albums dating back to the early-to-mid '90s later this year. Eno will reissue ‘Nerve Net' (1992), ‘The Shutov Assembly' (1992), ‘Neroli' (1993) and ‘The Drop' (1997) via All Saints Records on December 2. Each album will come with a bonus selection of unreleased material.
‘Nerve Net' comes with ‘My Squelchy Life', a previously ‘lost' album from 1991. ‘The Shutov Assembly' is issued with seven unreleased recordings originating from the same sessions. ‘Neroli' is coupled with ‘New Space Music', an hour-long piece of drone music, while the reissue of ‘The Drop' will include a bonus disc of nine tracks previously used for Eno's 2006 ‘77 Million Paintings' exhibit in Japan.
All the albums will be reissued on vinyl, apart from ‘Neroli' and ‘New Space Music' – because Eno didn't want to split the tracks up.
Listen to ‘Prague' – a bonus track from ‘The Shutov Assembly' – right now beneath.
Earlier this year, Eno teamed up with Underworld‘s Karl Hyde for collaborative album ‘Someday World' in May and its follow-up ‘High Life' in July.

Nearly 350 farmers have committed suicide in the five months since the state came into being on June 2 this year.
New state Telangana has recorded some bleak statistics in its first five months of existence - 348 farmers have committed suicide. While that will be a big issue in the state's first Budget session that began today, legislators are also pushing for a salary hike.The bigger pay package did not find mention in the budget presented by Finance Minister Etala Rajender today, but legislators from the ruling party Telangana Rashtriya Samiti or TRS say the government plans a Bill in this session to increase the salary of legislators from Rs. 1.2 lakh to Rs. 2 lakh a month.Such a hike will mean an additional expense of over Rs 38 crore per annum in a state that is reeling under a massive agriculture crisis brought on by an acute water and power shortage. While delayed and deficit rains have played havoc, social activists say no fresh bank loans and poor power supply this season have pushed debt-ridden farmers further into despair.Uttam Kumar Reddy a Congress legislator said it would be embarrassing to get a hike at a time when the entire state is reeling under drought.But Jupally Krishna Rao of the TRS said a salary hike for legislators hike was very justified and the Telugu Desam's Revanth Reddy said the increase should be even more. He said spending a little over Rs 3 crore on legislators salary was nothing at all, considering they had so many responsibilities and obligations as elected representatives.The BJP's Ramachandra Reddy said his party has not demanded the hike so they "are not responsible."Across parties, legislators however justified the hike in private, saying they need the extra money to function effectively. Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had also justified his proposal for a hike, saying that when they were presenting a one lakh crore budget, Rs 38 crore was not a big spending on legislators with many duties, responsibilities and obligations. Within the budget, a hike in Constituency Development Fund has been mentioned, from Rs 1 crore to Rs 1.5 crore that will cost the exchequer Rs 234 crores.

California Gov. Jerry Brown has expressed interest in banning cars that burn fossil fuels, the state's top climate change regulator said in an interview published Tuesday.
“I've gotten messages from the governor asking, ‘Why haven't we done something already?'” Mary Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Board, said in an interview with Bloomberg News.
California has, for years, pushed automakers to offer cars that produce no emissions, turning the state into the nation's largest market for electric cars. It has not, however, proposed an outright ban on cars running on the internal combustion engine.
Other governments have.
France and Britain will bar sales of new gasoline and diesel vehicles by 2040. Norway is aiming for 2025, even though the country remains a major oil producer. India has targeted 2030. Chinese officials are working on a ban but have not announced a timetable.
“The governor has certainly indicated an interest in why China can do this and not California,” Nichols told Bloomberg.
The governor's press office referred questions Tuesday to the air board, which runs most of California's climate change programs. A board spokesman declined to say whether a ban was under active discussion, and if so, when it might take effect.
“Given the existential challenge we face, the administration is looking at many, many possible measures — including additional action on electric vehicles — to help rapidly decarbonize the economy and protect the health of our citizens,” spokesman Dave Clegern said in an email.
The board's own projections suggest California will need to phase out new fossil fuel-burning vehicles by midcentury if the state hopes to meet its climate goals. Many Democratic leaders in Sacramento also want California to achieve 100 percent renewable electric power, but a bill to do so by 2045 died in the Legislature this year.
California law calls for trimming greenhouse gas emissions back to 1990 levels by 2020, then cutting them another 40 percent by 2030. By 2050, state officials want emissions slashed to 80 percent below 1990 levels, though that goal is not enshrined in law.
One board analysis found that zero-emission vehicles — such as electric cars and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles — would need to make up nearly 100 percent of new vehicle sales in the state by 2040to hit that 2050 emissions target.
“Timing matters,” said Simon Mui, director of the California vehicles and fuels program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. “By 2050, the phaseout of combustion technologies is needed to meet our climate goals.”
Cars and trucks represent California's biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions by far. In 2015, the last year for which complete data are available, on-road transportation produced 34 percent of the state's total emissions, according to the air board's data.
California regulations already force automakers to ensure that a percentage of the cars they sell in the state produce zero emissions. Those that can't meet the target, or choose not to, can buy credits from other automakers, such as Palo Alto's Tesla, that sell zero-emission vehicles.
More than 157,000 electric cars are now registered in California, roughly half of all such cars nationwide. But they remain a small fraction of cars on the road.
Automakers note that customers have been slow to embrace electric cars, which cost more than comparable gas-burning models. And although some new electric cars — notably the Chevy Bolt and the Tesla Model 3 — can go more than 200 miles on a fully charged battery, most have ranges up to 100 miles.
A full ban on fossil-fuel vehicles in California, which represents 12 percent of all auto sales nationwide, would jolt the industry.
“We have been working with California on intelligent, market-based approaches to emissions reductions beyond 2025, and we hope that this doesn't signal an abandonment of that position,” John Bozzella, president of the Association of Global Automakers trade group, said in an email Tuesday. “To reach our goals, we will need continued investment in new technologies, the infrastructure to support them, and, perhaps most importantly, consumers who will want to buy them.”

CLOSE A row of Tamarisk Trees have segregated a primarily black neighborhood from the rest of Palm Springs for decades.

PALM SPRINGS, Calif. — This California city will remove a row of trees blocking a historically African-American neighborhood from a city-owned golf course.
At an informal meeting with neighborhood residents Sunday, Palm Springs Mayor Robert Moon, council member J.R. Roberts and other city officials promised residents they would remove the tamarisk trees and a chain link fence along the Crossley Tract property lines as soon as possible.
Many longtime residents of the neighborhood previously told The (Palm Springs, Calif.) Desert Sun they believed the trees were planted for racist reasons in the 1960s, and remained a lasting remnant of the history of segregation in the city. Residents said the invasive tamarisks, which block views of the Tahquitz Creek Golf Course and San Jacinto mountains, have artificially depressed property values and prevented black families from accumulating wealth in their property over the past half century.
More: Long ago, these trees were planted for racist reasons, neighbors say. Now they want them gone
Roberts apologized to the Crossley Tract residents for any wrongdoing by the city in the past and said he and the rest of the council wanted to make the necessary changes to ensure future generations didn't have to deal with the same problems current and past residents faced.
“You asked why it took us this long,” Roberts told about 50 residents gathered for the meeting. “I can't answer that. But guess what? We're here now.”
Moon said Sunday he and Roberts had only a combined four years on the council and the problems posed by the trees only recently came to their attention. Moon said after he became aware of the issue, he visited the neighborhood to get a first-hand idea of what residents' concerns were.
Both Moon and Roberts assured residents that the neighborhood had the support of the entire council.
“It's a new city council and a new time,” Moon said.
City Manager David Ready said the tree removal wouldn't be immediate as the full city council would have to approve the matter. Arborists also would have to be consulted and the project — like any requiring significant city funds — would have to be put out to bid, Ready said. But he estimated the trees could be down within three months.
Ready previously said estimates the city had received for removing the trees were about $169,000. Approval of expenditures more than $20,000 have to go to the city council for the thumbs up, and city officials also have to figure out where, in a city budget stretched thin by rising public safety costs and hundreds of millions of unfunded pension liabilities and retiree healthcare costs, that money will be allocated from.

“It's not about a price to pay, it's about finding the money,” Roberts said at the neighborhood meeting.
Residents, led by real estate agent Trae Daniel, who moved into the neighborhood 14 years ago, have made four demands of the city. They include: removing the trees; building a 6-foot privacy wall for residents who want it; installing netting or something similar to prevent errant golf balls from flying into residents' yards; and planting new trees similar to those seen along other parts of the course.
Roberts said taking out the trees was the first step and after that had been taken care of, they would meet with residents to discuss what should be done next.

Many of the original inhabitants of the neighborhood were families who had been forcibly removed from during the 1950s and 1960s. Now some downtown Palm Springs' most lucrative real estate, the portion of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians' reservation hosting the convention center, casino and hotels was once home to thousands of black and Latino residents. They were evicted and their homes were bulldozed and burned when the city and the tribe agreed to clear the land for new development.
The Crossley Tract was founded by Lawrence Crossley, Palm Springs' first African American resident, in 1956. Crossley intended the 20-acre tract, which at the time was outside city limits, to be a place where black families who worked in Palm Springs but were barred from living there could live. City records indicate the area was incorporated into the city about a decade later, after Crossley's death.
At the same time, residential golf resorts were popping up all over the city. In 1958, work started on the Tahquitz Creek Golf Course, which was purchased by the city the following year when the developer ran into financial issues. Luxury condo developments were built-up around the course, and in the mid 1960s the trees were planted along the east side of the 14th fairway, blocking Crossley Tract residents' views of the course and the mountains and hiding the neighborhood from view from the course.

Democracy.com announced Thursday that it has unveiled what it calls the most comprehensive searchable database of American elected officials, candidates, appointees and political organizations at all levels of government.
As techPresident previously reported, the non-partisan Democracy.com platform launched last fall with the aim of establishing a social network for politics with a focus on helping local candidates have access to a professional web presence and fundraising tools.
With the rollout of the expanded search function, Democracy.com hopes to take another step towards making the political process more accessible in spite of a fractured American political landscape, explained Talmage Cooley, founder and CEO of Democracy.com.
"We live in an average of 10 political districts each and almost none of them have the same boundaries," he said. "Each of these districts has their own authority and management and ways of storing their information ... there is no single database that lets you find out who represents whom."
Existing tools, such as the Google Civic Information API that includes data from the Voter Information Project "do not go very deep with their data," he said.
To fill that gap, Democracy.com acquired a start-up called Voter's Friend that developed a proprietary scraping method with a special focus on locating elected official and candidate information on the hyperlocal level via websites, PDFs and other documents. "It's pretty easy to find this data at the federal and state level, but drilling down to the smaller community and county information, that's where 98 percent of the candidates are...in school board or judge races that you have never heard of."
The search database of 80,000 candidates and elected officials, which will eventually grow to all 550,000 elected officials in the United States, is integrated with the Democracy.com tools that let users donate, pledge to vote or sign up to volunteer for a candidate, incorporating campaign finance compliance requirements for all 50 states, Cooley pointed out.
Democracy.com is working on making an API of its data available to developers, Cooley said, and in about 60 days plans to make it possible for voters to create accounts with a public or private profile and "become micro-organizers within the site around the candidates and issues they care about."
"It really ties into taking action, directly from the search function and a candidate's profile you can donate, you can volunteer, we're kind of providing an entry point to voters to find what they care about," Cooley said.
Since the platform went live nine months ago, it has grown to around 2,600 candidates and organizations with verified profiles and 15,000 users overall including candidates, organizations and voters who have taken an action in support of a candidate.
To grow the userbase, Democracy.com has had significant success connecting with state-level and county-level party and advocacy group organizations, Cooley emphasized, now with over 800 partners including local Republican groups in Alabama, Colorado and Louisiana and local Democratic groups in California, Florida and Mississippi, among many others. Those sorts of "big networks" came to the site "far far faster than we expected," he said, and Democracy.com is now having conversations with national party leaders about providing the platform to their entire membership. "Up until now ... the state or national party had very few resources for their downballot candidates," he said, often giving the impression that the parties didn't care about those candidates. "They cared but they didn't have the resources," he said, noting that with Democracy.com, candidates have access to a free web presence that improves their searchability and search engine optimization and that the platform has helped to raise about $100,000 a week for candidates or organizations.
Cooley said he saw Democracy.com in the context of the trend of other specialized social networks such as Pinterest or Yelp. "Facebook can't be everything to everybody."
Democracy.com is not the only platform seeking to address the lack of unified data surrounding voting and elections. The Participatory Politics Foundation gathered its own collection of data on elected officials for its AskThem platform. And Wednesday night at a panel discussion on Open Source Democracy at New York Law School, Seth Flaxman, founder and executive director of Democracy Works, which launched TurboVote, said the non-profit would be releasing an API of all the data it has gathered for its service on when elections are happening at all levels of government.

Nathan Carman, saved after he said he spent a week adrift when boat sank, said he had nothing to do with grandfather's death and did all he could to find mother
A 22-year-old man rescued from a life raft after a fishing trip that left his mother missing and presumed dead had been a suspect in the still unsolved 2013 killing of his rich grandfather, adding to the multitude of questions swirling around him and what happened at sea.
Nathan Carman was picked up by a freighter on Sunday, 100 miles off the Massachusetts coast, after what he said was a week adrift that began when his 31ft aluminum fishing boat inexplicably sank during a mother-and-son outing.
Coast guard officials interviewed Carman, and police searched his home in Vermont as part of an investigation into the ill-fated trip. He has not been charged with anything.
In an interview with the Associated Press on Wednesday, he said he had “absolutely nothing” to do with his grandfather's killing and did everything he could to find his mother, 54-year-old Linda Carman, of Middletown, Connecticut, as their boat went down. He said he blew a whistle and called out frantically for her for hours.
“I was yelling, ‘Mom! Mom!'” Carman said. He added: “I loved my mother and my mother loved me.”
According to court documents, Carman came under suspicion in the killing three years ago of his maternal grandfather, 87-year-old John Chakalos, a wealthy real estate developer who was found shot dead in his Windsor, Connecticut, home.
A 2014 search warrant obtained by the AP said that Carman was the last person known to have seen Chakalos alive; that Carman had bought a rifle consistent with the one used in the crime; and that he discarded his hard drive and GPS unit used around the time of the shooting.
Carman was never charged. According to court papers, police submitted an arrest warrant to a prosecutor, but it was returned unsigned with a request for more information.
In his will, Chakalos left an estate worth more than $42m to his four adult daughters, including Carman's mother.
Capt Thomas LePore of Windsor police said on Wednesday that the case was still open and that Carman remained a “person of interest”.
“My grandfather was like a father to me, and I was like a son to him,” Carman told the AP. “He was the closest person in the world to me, and I loved him and he loved me, and I had absolutely nothing to do with his death.”
In the course of investigating the killing, authorities said in court papers that they learned from family members that Carman had a history of violence as a child, including one incident in which he allegedly held another child “hostage” with a knife. The documents also said Carman had several alarming episodes while he was a high school student, although no details of those incidents were given.
Authorities would not discuss the investigation into the boating trip.
Mother and son set off from a marina in South Kingstown, Rhode Island, on 17 September, authorities said. Carman told the AP that their boat sank in a matter of minutes around noon the next day after he heard a “funny noise” in the engine compartment and saw water pouring in.
He said he saw his mother in the cockpit and then saw her pulling in the fishing lines. He said he grabbed three bags containing food, flares and life jackets. But when he looked back, his mother was no longer there, he said.
“One minute I was standing on the deck, the next minute I was in the water,” he said.
Carman said the life raft self-inflated, and he swam to it, about 15-20ft away, and began calling for his mother.
On Monday, authorities searched Carman's home in Vernon, Vermont, and seized a modem, a SIM card and a letter. Their search warrant indicated investigators think that Carman was handling some boat motor repairs himself and that the vessel might not have been seaworthy.
“The investigation has also revealed that Nathan had intended to go fishing further offshore in a different location than what were his mother's intentions and understanding,” the warrant said.
Family members have said Carman has Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism that can be characterized by social awkwardness and repetitive behavior. Experts say people with Asperger's are no more likely than others to commit violent crimes.
His attorney, Hubert Santos, said that Carman cooperated fully with the coast guard and that his mother's death was a “tragic accident”.

Early football writers had to rely on some creative methods to complete their match reports. Thankfully one journalist left a book to show us how it was done
“I started reporting soccer in a very humble way,” recalls BJ (Bill) Evans in his 1946 book How to Become a Sporting Journalist. As an apprentice at the Western Daily Mercury in the early 1900s, Evans was sent out to cover minor league matches on a bicycle with two carrier pigeons in a basket. At the end of each half, he would fold up his written report, attach it to one of the pigeons and release it into the sky. “The bird wheeled over the ground,” he wrote, “often cheered by the two or three hundred spectators, and then made his way to the pigeon loft of the Mercury.”
Evans went on to make his name between the wars as chief sports writer for the Star (a now-defunct London evening title unconnected to the modern daily), earning a reputation as a “master-craftsman of sports journalism”. His book, part-careers guide, part-memoir, provided inspiration for a generation of highly regarded writers. The late Frank Keating wrote several times of the book's influence on his career, saying: “It changed my whole life.”
Revisited almost 70 years after it was written, How to Become a Sporting Journalist provides an entertaining glimpse into the profession's formative years, long before Twitter, live blogs and Sky's Sunday Supplement. Evans refers to himself as “a link between the old-fashioned and the modern”. He saw sports coverage expand as newspaper circulations increased, working practices change with the arrival of new technologies and previously anonymous journalists step out from behind nom de plumes (Evans' was “Polaris”) and into the public eye.
One of the early tales recounted in the book involves a trip to report on a Plymouth Argyle reserve game, at which Evans was asked to play in goal after the team's keeper sprained an ankle while stepping from his charabanc. “I placed my basket of pigeons inside the goal net,” Evans recalled, “and I honestly believe that it was anxiety for them even more than my desire to acquit myself well that enabled me to keep my end up. I even saved a penalty.”
Evans was able to leave his pigeons behind after moving to London in the 1920s. The Star had private telephone lines connected to local football grounds, allowing him to phone in his reports. This technological advancement leads Evans to provide a related piece of advice: “Always avoid words and phrases which may sound confusing over the wire.” Some of the book's advice remains useful today. “Cliches are the refuge of the poor sports writer,” is one enduring tip.
In particular, Evans implores readers to strive for accuracy. “The sports reporter should regard himself as a historian, a purveyor of facts,” he wrote. At big matches, without the benefit of TV replays, Evans would have a friend stand behind him with binoculars to ensure that no detail was missed. “If I were at all uncertain about any happening, I went into the players' room to get my facts right, thus securing first-hand information. The reader doesn't want you to guess who scored a goal, but wants to know who did actually score it.”
As a keen sportsman (he was a champion cyclist), Evans preferred the company of footballers, cricketers and boxers to fellow journalists: “I can honestly claim that the most famous footballers in a period of 20 years regarded me rather as a friend and fellow player than as a newspaper man.” His close relationship with players helped in ghost-writing columns and life stories, which he regarded as one of the most interesting and lucrative aspects of journalism.
Evans ghosted for Jack Cock, the England and Chelsea forward who was also a music hall and movie star, one of the biggest celebrities of the 1920s. There were no agents or other obstacles to negotiate. Evans lived near Cock and visited him every weekend, ghosting his life story before Sunday evening sing-songs. Another famous friend was England goalkeeper John Sutcliffe, who once rescued Evans after he collapsed during a bike race, picking him up off the street and reviving him with hot Oxo.
That Evans is not better remembered by fans and journalists today is partly because his archive of work (plus his collection of memorabilia) was destroyed when a bomb hit the Star offices during the second world war. “All my treasures went at one fell swoop,” he recalled. Dispirited by the devastating effects of the war, Evans retired from journalism in 1945 to farm a smallholding on Canvey Island. “When you are satiated with Cup finals,” he wrote, “you can always turn to the land and grow turnips.”

Today I had the privilege of attending our APWA Chapter meeting and then touring the Stearns Road Corridor Construction Project. Tours are offered a few times a year as a regular feature of APWA meetings and always provide great information. This particular tour offered a unique opportunity to visit the construction site of a $165 million project – definitely a significant size for our local area. Primary work included relocation of 4.6 miles of roadway, a new bridge over the Fox River, the widening and resurfacing of several intersecting routes, multi-use paths and stormwater facilities.
During our drive through the site, an engineer for the project pointed out specific areas of interest and shared with us some of the challenges they faced. The project team also used several forms of media to communicate to the public information about construction. Kane County set up a page on their Website at http://www.co.kane.il.us/dot/foxBridges/stearnsRd.aspx. And they posted two related videos on their YouTube Channel which can be viewed at http://www.youtube.com/user/KDOTTransportation. A dedicated Website was also created at http://stearnsroad.com for this specific project.
There was also one additional unique piece of information our tour guide shared with us that caught my attention. He mentioned the posting online of videos related to extraterrestrial activity associated with the project. Well, if you're like me, that's not something you hear everyday about a construction job. After I got home and Googled "Stearns Road" and "UFO" I found the YouTube videos he was talking about. Now, we all have had projects where people accuse construction activities of damaging their foundation, causing mysterious sinkholes in areas of their yards not anywhere near our sites, cracking their sewer or water pipes, flooding their basements, but until now, I had not yet heard of someone accusing construction of hiding UFO activity. I embedded the first of the four movies posted to date so you can hear for yourself. And feel free to post your own out of this world accusations you may have heard on your own jobs!
Hunger in young children affects cognitive, developmental and social skills, she said. “We're watching our kids get truncated from a very early age,” said Chilton. “Nutrition assistance programs are not enough to meet the actual needs of the American public … Very depressing.” An across-the-board 5 percent cut in benefits to food stamps recipients that went into effect in November signals that “the worst is yet to come.”
“What people don't realize is that the rate of insecure households with children under 6 actually increased,” said Mariana Chilton, director of Drexel University's Center for Hunger-Free Communities and an associate professor in the School of Public Health.
In 2013 there was not enough food for families at various times during the year in 6.8 million homes, or 5.6 percent of households. In 3.8 million homes, families were not able to provide adequate, nutritious food for their children. But the number of homes with kids who experienced hunger has dropped a bit since 2011.
“It's a matter of interpretation if you think it's good news or bad news,” said Alisha Coleman-Jensen, lead researcher with the USDA's Economic Research Service. “We didn't find anything that got worse. Basically, it seems like things are holding steady or improving a little bit, but it's not down to those prerecession levels.”
In 2013, 14.3 percent of households (17.5 million) experienced varying degrees of food insecurity , according to a report released Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The change from 2012 was not statistically significant, but the latest research shows a slight dip since 2011, when 14.9 percent of households suffered from hunger or poor nutrition.
More U.S. households are having a hard time putting food on the table than before the recession. But there is a sliver of hope: The numbers are not going up.
‘What people don't realize is that the rate of insecure households with children under 6 actually increased.'
Very low food security means that some family members sometimes went hungry during the year because there was not enough money to buy food. Another concern, albeit a less serious serious one, is a decline in the quality of the food but with few members of the household suffering hunger.
Shortage of food is more likely in homes where children are raised by a single mother and where people are living alone. Black and Hispanic households and homes with incomes below the poverty line suffer more. “Why do the racial and ethnic disparities continue to persist?” Chilton asked. “There is no movement. [Blacks and Hispanics] are suffering at three times the rate of white households. That's unacceptable.”
Hunger is more prevalent in rural areas and large cities than in suburbs and exurbs. The lack of food is higher than the national average in eight states, many in the South. Arkansas had the highest and North Dakota the lowest.
That comes as no surprise to Susan Fuller, secretary treasurer of Brother's Keeper Ministries in Poplarville, Mississippi, a rural town in Pearl River County, about 45 miles from the coast.
The group's pantry distributed food to 1,328 people in August. “The numbers have exploded since Hurricane Katrina, said Fuller, referring to the 2005 deadly storm that devastated the Gulf Coast. The day after Labor Day, “it was wall-to-wall people. It's the working poor and chronically unemployed, people with food stamps, people who can't support their families. They can't feed their families on what they make.”
Joseph Holland, a food policy expert at the University of Mississippi's Department of Public Policy Leadership, said there are growing efforts to address nutrition and hunger in Southern communities.
“There's some slight movement in trying to correct this from a local level,” he said. He points to local efforts to link food stamp recipients to farmers' markets and farm-to-school programs that provide nutritional education and healthy foods to schoolkids. “Local markets are a tool that can help utilize and enhance access to healthy foods.”
Despite these programs, Holland said, the problems are multifaceted. In many households, parents are juggling two or three jobs and may not have time to cook.
“It's a major public health crisis that continues to go unaddressed and is not taken seriously by the American public and government,” Chilton said. “Congress is not paying enough attention. The administration is not paying enough attention … We can do better. We can raise the minimum wage. We can target food stamp programs to reach families that are really struggling.”
I f the reactions to f the reactions to Kendrick Lamar's performance at the Grammys on Monday night, and to Beyoncé's performance at the Super Bowl a fortnight earlier, are anything to go by, you could almost script the various responses to the next time a black artist makes a political statement on stage.
The conservative right will shake its head in disbelief, decrying the performance as racist to white people or “ inciting violence ”. The liberal left will bristle with excitement, seizing the opportunity to explain why this has all been a long time coming. What will almost invariably be missing from the conversation are black voices.
Beyoncé's Formation reclaims black America's narrative from the margins Syreeta McFadden The singer's newest video is an inherently political and a deeply personal look at the black and queer bodies who have most often borne the brunt of our politics Read more
This is a particularly difficult point to make to liberals. To suggest that white commentary on black issues is unwelcome, no matter how well-meaning, only makes you seem thankless. But it's a question of space and time.
Europeans have been describing our blackness ever since they sailed the seas and encountered Africans. But with the invention of the printing press and the camera, white people have gone from describing blackness to defining it, and that definition has often served to justify hatred and violence.
Today, there is so little space in the public sphere to address in any constructive way the myriad reasons why black people from Brixton to Bahia are so often failed by the education, health, legal or justice systems. What space does exist is being taken up by white people who don't see that speaking on your behalf only reinforces the existing power dynamics.
The Black Lives Matter movement is a slow and painful global struggle to confront not just the glaring issues of our day (among them police brutality, a systemic lack of justice, the vilification of black men and violence against black women) but also to speak out about the micro-aggressions black people face which, of themselves, feel insignificant – harmless even – but which collectively reinforce inferiority and otherness.
The young South African poet Maya Wegerif describes this well in her poem Sometimes It Pours . Her words connect the dots of the Black Lives Matter movement across continents, from the hateful stares of an Afrikaner boy in rural South Africa to the casual racism of a bartender in Manhattan. She opens with the lines: “When in a college in Massachusetts a white boy takes a laptop out of a room, he is leaving / But when you take your laptop out of the room, you are stealing / The dean on duty is called, and the white policeman's spittle lands in your face as he tells you to calm down / Everybody wants you to calm down but no one wants to acknowledge what's happening and you are arrested for disturbing the peace.”
Kendrick Lamar galvanizes Grammys with politically charged performance Performance of Alright and The Blacker the Berry powerfully alludes to the treatment of black Americans in the prison-industrial complex Read more
This is not a plea against decency or for some misguided political correctness. Good people should always speak out against injustice and stand with the oppressed. But white people need to be mindful of dominating the discussion – standing alongside someone is different from usurping their space. It doesn't matter how well-meaning you are, how strong your sense of right and wrong is, or how many black friends you have: you have no idea what it's like to walk around in brown skin. To live with the knowledge that across the world, black people are at the bottom of the social heap. That desirability, intelligence and opportunity are all measured on a melanin scale, improving as you reach enviable white heights.
The ultra light Ember quilts are an incredibly versatile sleep system that have so many possible uses. Its balance of size and weight make it an excellent choice to travel with if you hostel and couch surf. It could be used cycle touring and has a place in the ultra light weight walkers pack. It could also be used over your sleeping bag to add an extra layer of warmth.
The Ember quilts can be used in a few different configurations. You can simply sleep under it like a traditional blanket if you don't like the feeling of being restricted in a sleeping bag, this allows you to stick your arms and legs out to control your temperature.
If the weather is colder and you wish to trap more warmth you can tighten the foot drawcord to create a mummy shape foot box, and also use the press studs
down the side of the quilt to close the bottom half of the quilt. Tightening the foot draw cord will cleverly create a pocket which can secure the end of the quilt over a sleeping mat. The upper section of the mat can be secured to the quilt by the supplied adjustable strap system that connects with press studs and will ensure that you not only stay securely atop your mat, but that you trap as much warmth around you as possible.
The Ember quilt uses our ultralight 15D shell and lining fabrics, and are filled with 750+ Loft Ultra Dry Down. The EbI uses a DEW through box baffle construction, removing internal baffles for a lighter and more compact construction, suitably adequate for its intended temperature range. The EbII uses a combined horizontal/ vertical baffled construction. The vertical baffles covering the chest section holds the down in place, preventing down from thinning over the torso.
EDGARTOWN, Mass. — President Barack Obama may have finally shed his summer curse – just in time for a daunting fall.
After a string of sunny seasons gripped by controversy, crises and plummeting popularity, the summer of 2015 has been among the most productive stretches of Obama's presidency. Late June victories in the Supreme Court on health care and gay marriage, along with a win for his trade agenda on Capitol Hill, were followed by the landmark Iran nuclear deal in July and the raising of the U.S. flag over a new embassy in Cuba in August.
Instead of being overshadowed by the 2016 presidential campaign, Obama's agenda has often been driving the debate among the candidates running to replace him.
And yet to the president, one of his summer's biggest successes may simply be making it through his annual vacation on the tony Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard largely uninterrupted. While his summer troubles have often trailed him on previous vacations, he's poised to close out this year's trip Sunday without any statements to the press or public appearances, beyond a few glimpses of him on the golf course and biking with his family.
“The president has absolutely appreciated the opportunity to take these two weeks outside of the hustle and bustle of Washington and spend some time with family and friends,” White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. “Once we return to Washington, our agenda is packed, so the president is grateful for some rest and relaxation in advance of what will be a very busy fall.”
Indeed, the president returns to Washington with a full schedule and confrontations with Congress that will help determine whether his summer momentum is sustained or sputters.
Atop the president's priorities is preventing Congress from blocking the Iran deal, which curbs Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in sanctions relief. Obama will likely have to veto a resolution of disapproval by lawmakers, blemishing his signature foreign policy initiative, but he appears on track to garner enough from support from Democrats to hold off Republican override efforts.
Obama is also hoping to avoid the second government shutdown of his presidency. Some conservative Republicans have threatened to hold up funding bills to keep the government open after Oct. 1 unless federal money for Planned Parenthood is cut.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has dismissed the prospect of a shutdown, saying “We've been down this path before.” Still, the issue has spilled into the 2016 presidential campaign, which will likely intensify the debate over linking government funding to the women's health organization.
Seeking to bolster his legacy abroad, Obama will also be pushing for a global climate treaty and finalization of a free trade agreement with Asia-Pacific nations. His string of summer successes began with Congress agreeing to a fast-track approval process for the trade pact when negotiations are complete.
September also holds a White House meeting with Pope Francis, a state visit for Chinese President Xi Jinping, where Beijing's high-profile hacking will be on the agenda, and the president's annual trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly.
For Obama, now deep in his second term, a busy, high-stakes agenda sure beats the alternative. His presidency appeared to be quickly slipping into lame-duck territory last year, but began to rebound after Democrats' defeats in the midterm election and picked up momentum this summer.
Summer has previously been Obama's cruelest season: the hostile health care town halls in 2009, the debt ceiling crisis in 2011, the president's waffling on Syria's chemical weapons use in 2013. Last summer was consumed by the swift rise of the Islamic State and the group's gruesome beheading of Americans, as well as tensions in Ferguson, Missouri, after a white police officer fatally shot an 18-year-old black man.
Free this year from an all-consuming crisis, the president spent most of the two-week summer vacation on the golf course, at the beach and dining out with his family. He also attended a party on the island thrown by Democratic power broker Vernon Jordan, who also hosted an even last year where Obama was spotted on the dance floor.
But there were no images of Obama dancing this year. Perhaps in a sign that even a president riding high in his second term has a short shelf life, the band instead posted a video of a dancing Hillary Rodham Clinton, the top contender to be the next Democratic president.
Musa Ali, 20, has a broken arm and several bruises on his head. Patrick, 32, walks around on crutches and both his arms and legs are bandaged. Next to him is a young man from Cameroon with a bandage around his forehead, a bloody eye and several cuts near his eyebrow. There are other Africans here with all kinds of wounds. It is a desolate spectacle to behold, and it is taking place in a corner of the campus of Oujda University in eastern Morocco, along the border with Algeria.
Hundreds of undocumented migrants from sub-Saharan Africa live and sleep here, out in the open, in patios into which the police are not allowed and the university has been letting border transients use for years out of humanitarian concern.
The number of people with injuries here is striking. Every so often, somebody new limps in. In most cases, they claim it was the Moroccan police who did it.
"They kicked me and they hit me with a large wooden stick near the border with Melilla before deporting me to Algeria," says a nervous Musa Ali.
"They hit you and hit you. And we can't report it or do anything about it. What do they think we are, animals?" he asks.
They hit you and hit you. And we can't report it or do anything about it"
It is an undeniable fact that there are lots of wounded people in Oujda. Whether this is a result of abuse or whether there are other causes is something the courts could look into. But that is precisely another common complaint around here: the migrants say they cannot report abuse and that they do not even have the right to a lawyer during their deportation process.
"The hospitals refuse to extend medical reports and their complaints are not recorded," says Hicham Rachidi, president of a migrant support group called Gadem.
"The fact that they are taken from Morocco to Algeria immediately after their arrest makes it impossible for them to appeal, which is a right granted by Morocco's immigration law. They are being denied the right to a defense. The whole procedure is illegal."
Oujda University - or La Fac (The Faculty), as they call this ghetto - is a transit area for sub-Saharan migrants moving north to Europe. Some of them have just arrived in Morocco after passing through Algeria, but many others were deported back there from the border with Melilla (a Spanish enclave located to the west) after trying to jump the fence into Spanish territory or while waiting for a chance to do so in the mountains near Nador. In fact, many of the individuals here have been in and out of Oujda several times, in an endless loop.
When the sub-Saharan migrants reach Morocco through Algeria, their first stop is either La Fac or the mountains near Oujda; here they remain until they can put together enough money (chiefly via begging) to travel the 150 kilometers that separate them from Nador, a Moroccan city on the border with Melilla. Once they are there, if they are unable to reach Spanish territory over the fence or via the sea route, and end up getting arrested, Moroccan authorities take them straight back to the border with Algeria. This border crossing is closed, but Moroccan police officers get the migrants off the buses and instruct them to keep walking until they reach the neighboring country.
Many here have been in and out of Oujda several times, in an endless loop
" Allez, allez! [Come on, come on!]," they scream at us, explains a Senegalese man at La Fac.
"Sometimes they shove us along. As soon as they leave, we turn around and walk right back to Oujda. It takes several hours and we have to keep hiding from the police, but if they leave us at the border at night, by daybreak we are back in Oujda again."
This is the deportation procedure that Gadem association describes as illegal.
This newspaper tried unsuccessfully to reach Morocco's Interior Ministry for its side of the story. On Friday a ministry spokesman agreed to speak on the phone, and was sent a list of questions via email regarding the origin of the migrants' wounds, the medical assistance they have access to and whether they have the right to any kind of legal counsel. There was no reply, and the spokesman would not take any further phone calls, despite repeated attempts.
The immigrants' version of events is that they are being beaten for trying to reach Spain; the Moroccan police are allegedly trying to prevent them from jumping the fence into Melilla and close a route whose final destination is not Morocco. They also say they are being treated in a way that illegal immigrants would never be treated in Spain.
The migrants claim that the situation was not so bad a year ago, saying the Moroccan law enforcement agents did not display such violence back then. They say that their belongings and documents get taken away, never to be recovered, and that their basic rights are being violated.
Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the only humanitarian group to provide the Oujda migrants with medical help, said in a statement that between June 25 and July 16 its personnel in the area assisted 165 people with "wounds caused by violent assault."
"Among these were 81 individuals who were taken by force to this border town with Algeria following massive arrests conducted by Moroccan police in Nador on July 11," said MSF.
There are professionals amoung us, and yet they treat us like cattle"
"Are you journalists?" asks Ibrahim, a mechanical engineer from the Gambia who speaks in almost perfect English. Ibrahim is clearly angry. "See with your own eyes what the situation is like here," he says. "We're just looking for a better life, like any other person. Do you really find it so strange for us to leave countries where there is nothing? That is why we want to go to Spain, to Europe. There are professionals here like myself. People with things to contribute. And here they treat us like cattle. If they want to return us to our countries, let them do so, but in accordance with the law. There are no rights here. Human rights have been suspended. When Spain delivers us to Morocco, it should know that this is what they do to us."
But not everyone is so happy to see journalists around. La Fac is also home to mafias that do what they please, trafficking in people or sexually exploiting women, or both. At one point, a group of five people walk up to the two youngsters showing the journalists around and tell them in an extremely threatening tone to take the Europeans away immediately.
Moroccan humanitarian groups working in the area say they have not seen such numbers of wounded people since 2005, when thousands of Africans threw themselves at the fences around Ceuta and Melilla, the two Spanish autonomous cities that are surrounded by Moroccan territory. Some of the migrants who did were shot down. Others were taken by bus and truck to desert areas on the border with Algeria, and left there with no food or water. Others still were transferred to the Sahara desert and dumped in territory controlled by the Polisario Front, the Western Sahara independence movement. Dozens of sub-Saharans who had settled in major cities such as Casablanca and Rabat suffered the same fate.
Things calmed down after that. Spain raised the fence around Melilla from three to six meters, Morocco stepped up controls in the area, and migratory pressure relented. But last year, the number of migrants around Ceuta and Melilla began rising again, gradually reaching peaks of 1,000 people, who arrived this summer in the mountains around Melilla, according to the Spanish Civil Guard. Moroccan aid workers who assist immigrants feel that violence is on the rise again following the death of a Moroccan military officer who was allegedly killed by a stone hurled at him by a migrant trying to climb the fence.
The wounded men in Oujda are asking for painkillers. In the morning they stand in line to get examined by MSF aid workers. They also go to hospitals and health centers in the city.
La Fac is also home to mafias that traffic in people or sexually exploit women
"At La Fac, we take care of them," says the Gambian Ibrahim. "But somebody has to do something for them."
His colleague Alhaji, from Senegal, has lost half a leg. He says he was run over by a train as he was running away from Moroccan agents. "It was an accident, but now here I am, unable to walk, sleeping on this basketball court. I cannot reach Spain and I cannot return to my country. What do I do?"
Next to him, sitting on a blanket, his friend Lamine has an open atlas in front of him. He is staring at Spain. Another young man with a bandaged arm and a lost look in his eyes tells how they kicked him until he was nearly unconscious.
"I made it to Melilla. The Civil Guard turned me over to Morocco and I was beaten half to death," he says in French. "Excuse me for not standing up anymore, but I need to sit down. Do you have any medicine?"
The immigrants say there are also wounded people in Nador and around Melilla. Two support groups, Asociación Rif de Derechos del Hombre and Asociación Beni Znassen para la Cultura, el Desarrollo y la Solidaridad, issued a joint release on August 10 expressing concern "for immigrants living in the Nador region, where they are confined in precarious and unacceptable conditions, living in a state of insecurity and anguish, and bereft of any means of subsistence."
MSF says it is "very concerned" about the situation in Nador. "The number of victims of violence that we have seen in our mobile clinics in Nador has been on the rise since late May," explains the aid organization's general coordinator for Morocco, David Cantero.
"In July, 34 percent of our visits had to do with violence, when in May that figure was 18 percent." In July, MSF took 20 immigrants to Al Hassani hospital, where they were seen to by health personnel. Nine required hospitalization for concussions, broken jaws and fractured limbs. Three had to undergo surgery. Cantero underscores that "the organization wishes to improve coordination with the state health services in the area to increase the number of mobile clinics and guarantee medical assistance to migrants who require it."
Marian, 32, who is from Chad, lives in a forest near Nador and has also seen widespread police abuse. "My husband was arrested. I don't know where he is. They took his cellphone. I suppose they are taking him to Oujda right now. They hunt us down like animals."
Even as Marian is speaking, around 30 Moroccan law enforcement agents show up. They try to take the photographer's camera away and they arrest both of us. ("This is not an arrest, but you have to come down with us to the police station, whether you want to or not," they tell us.) They ask repeatedly whether we work for MSF. One police officer justifies the arrest thus: "It is illegal to speak with illegal immigrants without permission from the state." End of the interview. Two hours later, they say it was all a misunderstanding.

There are only three weeks left of football – maybe the best football we've seen all year – but still, the NFL season is almost over, and that sucks. As excited as I am to see a new champion emerge, I am equally scared to go about my life without football for the next several months, and I know there are thousands of fans who feel the same way.
Knowing the end is near changes how we view things. Playoff games are already overanalyzed, and the magnifying glass only gets bigger as the weeks go by. Here we are, the day before the AFC and NFC Championship Games, and every aspect of both games has been broken down. All positional matchups have already been covered, and I'm sure that every possible result has been predicted by one “expert” or another. This makes it awful tough for me to offer a “unique take” on it all, but I'll give it a whack anyway.
I firmly believe that despite the high-profile quarterbacks on either end, the AFC Title game will be won at –or near – the line of scrimmage. More specifically, here are a couple positional matchups that deserve more attention.
When the Patriots have the ball
The offensive line of New England has improved a great deal as the season has gone on. Although it is the same patchwork group that allowed Brady to be sacked 40 times in the regular season, their suddenly dominant run blocking has defined the team's playoff run to this point. How well they handle Denver's defensive line on inside handoffs – primarily Terrance Knighton and Shawn Phillips – will determine what role the Broncos linebackers will play. If the Patriots have difficulty moving the ball inside, that frees up Linebackers Trevathan and Woodyard to focus on pass coverage.
Another matchup that draws my attention is WR Danny Amendola versus Champ Bailey. While I'm not positive that this is how Defensive Coordinator Jack Del Rio will play things, I'm fairly certain that CB Rodgers-Cromartie will be tasked with keeping the versatile Julian Edelman in check. If this is how it works out, I think Amendola's speed creates major problems for an aging Bailey. Maybe he will get some extra safety help, which could leave DRC and Edelman 1-on-1. Regardless of how they choose to defend the two small, speedy wideouts, the Broncos are going to have their hands full without starting Corner Chris Harris in the lineup
When the Broncos have the ball
The injuries to Jerod Mayo and Vince Wilfork will most likely become targets for the Denver offense, which means Chandler Jones, Rob Ninkovich, and Jamie Collins have a lot of slack to pick up – and in recent weeks, they've done exactly that. But keeping tabs on Knowshon Moreno and Montee Ball without sending too many defenders is crucial, as the Pats will need to dedicate most of their resources to pass coverage if they have any hope of containing Thomas, Thomas, Decker, and Welker.
In my opinion, the biggest x-factor for the Broncos is TE Julius Thomas. His size and pass-catching ability often creates drastic mismatches for opposing defenses, but the Patriots may have an answer for him. New England met a similar threat in Week 6 when they faced Jimmy Graham and the Saints. Graham was held without a catch by physical CB Aqib Talib, and I feel like Thomas might be handled the same way. I could be wrong though, as Jamie Collins did a great job last week against Colby Fleener. But Fleener isn't quite Thomas, so the Pats must either risk that matchup or pull Talib off of Decker or the other Thomas. Neither of these scenarios bode well for New England.
My Prediction
Belichick has always had Peyton's number in the playoffs, but Peyton has never had so much talent around him. Denver's weapons in the passing game will spread New England's defense thin, allowing Moreno and Ball to run wild. I also expect the Patriots to move the ball well, relying heavily on the run game again. Amendola hauls in a couple long balls, and Edelman will perform at about the level that is expected from him. However, they will not be able to match Denver's scoring pace, leading to Tom Brady seeing more pressure as New England falls behind and is forced to abandon the ground game.
Denver wins 38-27

According to the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, John Sopko, who recently sat down for an interview with Sharyl Attkinson of Full Measure, the ongoing problem may have been worse than anyone realized, but was being addressed by President Donald Trump's Pentagon.
“We've been raising this concern about ghosts going back a number of years,” Sopko said. “Actually I want to say we heard about it from (Afghan President) Ashraf Ghani years ago, before he became president, he warned me about ‘ghosts,' so we started looking three years ago.” Read more: CT
What? Sopko said, “We started looking three years ago”? The DOD has been doing this since 2002! Think of all of the millions stolen for about 10 years! Pitiful!
Fox News reported in November about the $300 million annually given to Afghanistan:
The Department of Defense has pledged to closely monitor Afghan active-duty security forces so that U.S. taxpayer money is not squandered on so-called “ghost” soldiers, Stars and Stripes reported.
In a letter released Friday to the Pentagon, the office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, said it was concerned about “significant gaps between the assigned force strength of the (Afghan National Defense and Security Forces) and the actual number of personnel serving.”
The letter, obtained by FoxNews.com, cites reports indicating discrepancies between the assigned force strength of the ANDSF and the actual number of personnel serving.
In 2002 Congress appropriated $68 BILLION to “Afghan Active Duty Security Forces or ANDSF…You can only imagine the “major fraud” that took place from then on…
Kevin Nagle, chairman and CEO of Republic FC, works out of an El Dorado Hills office filled with high-end sports art and memorabilia, the highlight of which has to be a large mural reproducing the famous image of Muhammad Ali standing over a vanquished Sonny Liston in their fabled “Phantom punch” title fight of 1965.
It's quite a sight in the waiting room of the venture capital firm that Nagle runs. The piece speaks to Nagle's passion for sports, as do the vintage jerseys of Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky and other items. But Nagle's connection to athletics is about more than just entertainment. Sports helped to fill painful voids in his life and create a framework for professional success that delivered him from a difficult childhood.
Nagle, 63, made a fortune starting and then selling pharmaceutical companies before investing in Republic FC and moving the minor-league soccer franchise to the brink of a berth in Major League Soccer, a decision Nagle hopes will come in December. He also is known as a key local investor in the Kings who was recruited for that deal by his close friend, former Mayor Kevin Johnson. When Nagle joined other locals by investing in the Kings, it was a key first step in proving to the NBA that Sacramento was serious about keeping its basketball team from relocating to Seattle.
With Republic FC, Nagle is trying to up the ante by proving that Sacramento is a place that supports not only professional sports teams, but major investments of hundreds of millions of dollars. He's taking the risk himself by putting up his own money while recruiting big name investors such as Meg Whitman, CEO of Hewlett-Packard, and using that clout to finance the rest.

Warren Smith, the former River Cats executive, had the dream of starting Republic FC as a minor-league soccer team that could grow. But without Nagle, that dream never reaches its ultimate payoff. In a town full of people paying lip service to the city's potential, Nagle is the one who did more than just talk about moving Sacramento into a new realm of economic vitality. He put his money on the table and stepped up to roll the dice.
His office is a testament to the life of privilege he built for himself by taking calculated risks, though his most prized memento is one he acquired before he became wealthy.
A 1967 photo of Kevin Nagle and his baseball team in Long Beach. Courtesy of Kevin Nagle
It's a grainy photo of a 1967 Long Beach Little League team filled with 12- and 13-year-old boys wearing white baseball uniforms and red caps. The photo has faded over the decades, and you have to look closely to notice the slight-looking lad in the back row who is sporting the uniform but no cap.
It turns out that kid – the only player in the photo without a hat – was the son of a single mother who worked as a cashier and struggled to make ends meet. The kid had been earning his own money since he was 6 by chasing golf balls and selling them back to the players who had mishit them, but he didn't have the $45 he needed to buy his uniform. So after making the team he talked his coach into letting him pay installments of $2.50 per game until he reached $45. The coach reluctantly agreed, but withheld ownership of the kid's cap and official league card until his debt was paid.
So there he is, frozen for posterity in that photo, an underdog defined by tousled brown hair and a missing hat. That kid, of course, was Nagle, and that moment crystallized his formula for success: First you calculate the value of things, then you will yourself to attain them by mind, desire, diligence and patience.
Nagle said his earliest memories are of a cramped duplex he and his mother shared with a treasured uncle, and his uncle's family, after Nagle's biological father left when he was an infant. Home was in Moorhead, Minn., across the Red River from Fargo, N.D., before Nagle's family packed up and moved to Long Beach when Nagle was 8.
There, he played sports and the games awoke a competitive spirit he didn't know he had. The team structure gave him a sense of belonging that he badly needed. And playing allowed him to prove to himself that he could be as good as anyone else once he put his mind to it. That desire was stoked by living in a home where, at various times, the electricity or the phone or the water was turned off because there wasn't enough money to make the payments.
“You start to realize it's about survival,” Nagle said of his formative years. “I realized at an early age that I had to make a contribution. ... I had to go out there and bring something back in the way of resources.”
Nagle's mother, Theresa, came from an Italian family where everyone pitched in, everyone worked and complaining was frowned upon. For Christmas, Nagle got presents based on need: “Shirts, socks, undergarments,” he said.
“But we were always clean, there was always enough food. ... I vowed that I would never raise my own family in (such circumstances), but I say that without any hard feelings toward my mother. When I eulogized her I said that no other person had a greater influence on me than my mother.”
Nagle's mom taught him the value of hard work, of family and relationships. With that foundation, he excelled at using his wits to achieve his goals. He became the community college student who would get a four-year degree at Long Beach State in political science and then a master's in business and public administration at USC while on scholarship. He's the self-made millionaire who ascended without the benefit of legacy wealth bestowed by rich relatives.
Nagle was a data geek long before that became popular in business. He and his partners calculated that there was money to be made in managing the medical benefits of patients. In 2015, Nagle and his partners sold EnvisionRx, a drug benefit company, for $2 billion.
Befitting his humble roots, Nagle is approachable and cordial. He's close to his two grown daughters. He had hoped to take his 92-year-old uncle, the one who sheltered his mom and him, to the World Series had the New York Yankees made it. He likes to travel in his own plane, which he has shared numerous times to friends and employees.
He moved to Northern California two decades ago, and has used his wealth to invest heavily in the idea of Sacramento as a region on the rise. He went in with friend Mark Friedman and others on the Ice Block development project on 16th and R streets that is energizing midtown Sacramento.
Nagle is a force behind Moneta Ventures, the Folsom venture capital firm that raised $25 million – a big number for the Sacramento region. He is aiming to make his own venture capital firm, Jaguar Ventures, worth up to a quarter of a billion dollars, and the plan is to invest that money in Sacramento-based companies.
With Republic FC, Nagle assembled an ownership group that will pay for the team and a $226 million privately financed stadium in the old downtown railyards (should Sacramento get the MLS bid). The project would be a cornerstone of revitalization for a massive swath of land that has sat empty for generations.
Earlier this year, Nagle and his group submitted hundreds of pages that detailed Republic FC's plans for a stadium that will seat nearly 20,000. On Monday, consultants for MLS will be in town to review the progress Republic FC has made on its stadium plans. Those consultants will compile a progress report that will be used by a key MLS expansion committee that will meet in early November and then make a recommendation to the full complement of MLS owners, who are scheduled to promote two new franchisees to the MLS in mid-December.
At this critical juncture, Nagle thinks Sacramento has a solid chance at making the final cut. “I'm not taking anything for granted,” he said, “but I feel good.”
Considering his background, this isn't the most dire challenge he has faced in his life. Growing up without a father, and without financial resources, was much tougher. But he wants Republic FC to become an MLS team in the same way he wanted that baseball cap when he was 12, and said he sees similarities between himself and his adopted city.
“If you look at the rest of my life, it's like an underdog thing again,” he said. “If people are always writing off Sacramento before we start, (then) that's the challenge for me. I'm going to take that on.”

New York State banned fracking earlier this month, citing the potential risks to public health. In Pennsylvania, where shale gas drilling has boomed, the state has not studied those risks systematically and some say, deliberately ignored them. A new governor says he wants to take a different approach.
At a news conference the day after New York announced its ban, Pennsylvania's Democratic Governor-elect Tom Wolf summed up his views on fracking:
“I want to have my cake and eat it, too,” he said. “I don't want to do what New York did.”
Wolf wants a new tax on drilling to pay for a lot of his priorities like education. He also wants to create a health registry to measure the potential impacts of heavy drilling.
“In the absence of a strong concern for health, you have problems,” he said. “I think we ought to do this right.”
The drilling health registry is not a new idea for Pennsylvania.
In 2011, outgoing Republican Governor Tom Corbett's Marcellus Shale Advisory Commission recommended a long-term program to monitor the health of residents within one mile of natural gas development sites and to fully investigate any complaints. However, the state Department of Health has never received the funding to do the work and the intersection of public health and fracking remains a thorny issue in Harrisburg.
Black water, then strange symptoms
But if state health officials ever came to Kim McEvoy's neighborhood, she'd have a lot to say.
In 2011, her water turned grey. Then, “coal black,” she said.
McEvoy is one of several residents of the Woodlands – a rural community in Butler County, western Pennsylvania – who have complained that natural gas development has damaged their water supplies and their health.
One night, McEvoy says she almost fainted while taking a shower.
“I still had soap on my body and I just got out of the shower and I'm like, ‘I am so dizzy, I can't even stand,'” she remembers.
McEvoy's fiancé helped her to the bed where she sat, wet and soapy, trying to stay conscious.
“Just take a break, take a break,” he told her.
That wasn't the last shower episode. Also, McEvoy's long black hair began falling out in clumps and her fingernails began to grow strangely, curving with grooves and ridges.
Susan Phillips/ StateImpact Pennsylvania
Her symptoms started going away, she says, only when she stopped using her well water. The company drilling and fracking nearby provided her for a while with a storage tank known as a “water buffalo.”
McEvoy had no health insurance and no primary care doctor. So she called the state Department of Health, but the person who answered the phone told her to call the Department of Environmental Protection instead.
“They have no departments handling anything that had to do with gas and oil drilling. They told me that. Then they said, ‘You need to call the DEP,'” she said. “Well, [they] didn't care if my hair was falling out.”
The DEP had already told McEvoy and her neighbors that gas drilling did not contaminate their water wells.
Health Department officials say they have referred fracking-related complaints to their epidemiology experts, who have investigated fully.
But two former staffers say the Department of Health had policies in place that kept them quiet about fracking.
Former staffers accuse Pa. of ignoring health complaints
In 2012, health department officials circulated a list of drilling-related “buzzwords” to its community health staff. The list included phrases like “hair falling out,” “skin rash” and “fracking.” Callers mentioning these words were to be directed to the department's Bureau of Epidemiology.
The two retired staffers told StateImpact Pennsylvania earlier this year that they were also instructed not to discuss callers' concerns at any length and not to give them any information.
The Department of Health continues to dispute the former employees' claims and says it fully investigates all health complaints.
Celeen Miller is a volunteer public health advocate in Bucks County who estimates she has helped about a dozen people like Kim McEvoy lodge complaints. She doesn't believe the Health Department under Governor Corbett has fully investigated drilling-related concerns.
In 2011, people began reaching out to Miller when they “hit a wall” with staff at the department's regional offices who told them to contact the DEP instead. Early the following year, she began arranging conference calls with staff at the Bureau of Epidemiology.
“People talked about headaches, dizziness when they took a shower, rashes on their arms when water touched their body, dogs throwing up, children getting sick,” Miller said. “Some of the calls were so upsetting that I felt very teary-eyed after we hung up.”
The Department of Health claims it has logged 76 complaints, but has found no link between drilling and illness. The department has refused to release information about the location, the nature or any resolution of these complaints.
Miller argues the agency has not given its staff the time or the resources to do its job.
“Our elected officials could empower the health department either through policy or regulation to do more,” she said. “We've lost 3 and a half years at least of doing some meaningful investigation on drilling operations and its impact on water and land and on people's health.”
Last August, in response to the former staffers' allegations, the Department of Health announced changes to its policies for handling complaints about gas drilling – including regular updates to its website and bi-weekly meetings with the Department of Environmental Protection.
The Department of Health declined an interview request to discuss the changes for this story.
“Through the improvements announced earlier this summer, we have enhanced our efforts and continue our ongoing commitment to prioritizing the health needs of Pennsylvanians,” said spokeswoman Holli Senior in a statement.
Miller has seen some positive changes over the last five months. For example, she says state health officials no longer rely on people filing complaints to send them water test results.
“Now the Department of Health representatives will offer to get the lab results directly from the DEP and that is an important change,” she said, noting many of the people she works with may not have access to the Internet or a fax machine. Some of them are worried that sharing documents could compromise their lawsuits against drilling companies.
“They don't care”
Miller is optimistic that the Wolf administration will push for a more proactive approach. However, the health registry idea has never won favor with Republican leaders in the state legislature.
“What we don't want is something that unnecessarily scares residents in the district,” said Drew Crompton, a spokesman for Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati (R-Jefferson).
“We want the public health effects to be known, but we also don't want people just showing up at people's doors saying, ‘We would like you to be a participant in this study because we believe that Marcellus Shale drilling is having adverse effects on your health.'”
Crompton says Scarnati plans to reintroduce a bill creating an advisory panel that would review research on drilling and health. That bill never made it out of committee last year.
Meanwhile, Kim McEvoy wonders why her state government seemed so uninterested in finding out why she was getting dizzy, losing her hair, and watching her fingernails change shape.
“You would think they would be caring about the health and wellbeing of Pennsylvanians, but apparently they did not,” she said. “That's how I felt like well, they don't care.”
In 2012, when McEvoy grew tired of living with discolored water, she packed up her family and moved to another town. She says she was forced to foreclose on her home because no one wanted to buy a house with bad water.

Worried about kids and materialism and the constant desire for more? Learn how to raise non materialistic children and instill important values.
Piles of holiday gifts. Extravagant parties. The desire for the latest toy and discarding the perfectly good ones they already have. Worse, looking down on other kids who don't have the same things they do.
Regardless of how much a child has, it's easy to value materials and use it as a measure of self-worth. Materialism also doesn't allow children to practice the skills that will serve them better in life, such as gratitude, empathy and delayed gratification.
Materialism exists regardless of a family's income. After all, anyone—from those with the least money to the most—can still want what they don't have, and value them above other parts of their lives.
MY LATEST VIDEOS
So I do my best to raise non materialistic children, no matter our circumstances. I've found the best ways include focusing on the values you want to promote and redefining what it means to raise your child into the adult you want him to become.
What makes children materialistic?
But first, what are the common culprits that lead children to value materialism? Research points to a few sources:
From us. Parents model behaviors that kids adapt for themselves, like when you show joy from having purchased a new television, or when your kids overhear your preference for high-end brands. They learn we place high value on material items, especially expensive or extravagant ones.
From unhappiness. Like adults, kids can feel a void in their lives. These empty spaces can be due to low-income, low self-esteem and comparing themselves to others. Left unhappy, kids turn to material goods for the initial rush and satisfaction they provide.
From the media. Television and advertising sell you on the idea that you don't have enough. They want you to seek more material goods (especially their items) to fit right in. With a wider exposure to expensive lifestyles, kids turn to items for fulfillment and assume these things will make their lives better.
How to raise non materialistic children
Thankfully we can do a lot to combat these sources and raise non materialistic children. Take a look at these simple but effective ways to do so:
1. Limit how much stuff you give
Imagine having one skirt. It's a good-quality, beautiful skirt you've worn and cherished over the years.
Now imagine adding to your collection—maybe you have twenty skirts. That first skirt might start losing its appeal, its special-ness.
Take that number even higher—let's say you have 100 skirts hanging in your closet. Now how much will you cherish that first skirt—any of the skirts, really—when there are 99 others?
Abundance is good… up to a point. After a while, your possessions become plain items you toss around with no meaning. Things aren't cherished—they're not enough. Soon, we're on an endless chase for the next best thing instead of appreciating what we have.
Kids notice this. Keep toys and play things to what's enough for your kids and nothing more. Think about whether you kids need the latest learning tools (they usually don't).
Because the more you give, the higher the standards you set. Buying your son a toy car every weekend might bring joy those first few weeks, until he gets upset when you don't come home with a toy. Rightly so—he has come to expect a toy every weekend and is upset when he doesn't get one.
Read more about the downsides of having too many toys.
2. Encourage experiences over items
If you want your kids to be happy, ditch material gifts and give them experience gifts. Material gifts make us happy for three months before its novelty wears out, but the satisfaction of experiences last much longer.
Think about the first time you purchased your phone. I'm guessing you took all precautions to keep it clean and marveled at the new features you can use. Fast forward a few months later and you probably toss your phone in your purse and forgot its hefty price tag.
Then think about your last vacation, the date night with your partner, or the time you took your daughter to a museum. Those experiences make a more lasting impression compared to an item you'll forget in three months.
I asked my son what his favorite part of the day was, and he replied, “Playing the pillow game with my brother.”
“Pillow game” involves both of them taking turns hugging a pillow and laughing after the fact.
Both had a good time for something they made up and didn't need any material items (I won't count the pillow). You won't find a price tag on a play date with friends or a special one-on-one moment with you.
3. Require kids to earn treats and extras (or at least wait for them)
Should your kids want something that isn't on your priority list, teach them to save or earn the money. Start a savings account for your kids where they can learn how to budget for big-ticket items.
With a limited income, kids are forced to make hard decisions on what's important and what isn't. They'll also learn how much time and effort goes into making purchases, and that money doesn't come instantly.
If your kids aren't old enough to grasp the concept of saving, have them wait before you make your purchases. My eldest had been hankering for stickers for several weeks before I finally bought them. I could spend $2 to buy stickers, but I explained to him that I don't want to use my money to buy stickers all the time.
4. Limit and deconstruct advertisements
The American Psychological Association recommends kids under eight-years-old not see advertising targeting children. This is for good reason:
“Research shows that children under the age of eight are unable to critically comprehend televised advertising messages and are prone to accept advertiser messages as truthful, accurate and unbiased.”
When your kids watch the latest ads about toy cars and junk food, they believe them as true.
The less television and advertising kids watch, the less they'll take advertising as truth. They won't feel like they need these items to have fun, have friends and feel good.
If your child happens to catch some advertising, deconstruct the message and encourage conversation. Let him know ads are trying to sell items, and discuss the ways they're doing so. Talk about the smiling kids, the fast toys, bright colors and big text—all techniques advertisers use to get kids to buy their stuff.

5. Encourage gratitude and giving
Gratitude reminds children how much they're blessed and thwarts the desire for more stuff.
Teach gratitude and giving. If your child has toys and clothes galore, remind her how thankful you are and for how much it took to give her these.
When she receives gifts, focus more on how cool it is that Aunt Jane thought of her when she gave her a new play set. Discuss how loved she is by the people who showered her with presents.
And encourage giving with your child. She can donate to charity, volunteer, or learn to share and give with other kids. An SSBE reader wrote how she tries to raise non materialistic children by taking her daughter out to shop, not to buy gifts for herself, but for other people.
When we give, we're reminded that we still have something to give in the first place.

Conclusion
Raising non materialistic children isn't about shaming luxury or downplaying the joy of new items. I love the feeling of getting something new, and we need material items to survive and enjoy life.
But we can also help our kids shift the focus away from material goods and cast the sources of their joys wider.
Limit how much stuff you give, even if you have the means to provide them. And when you do, focus on giving experience gifts over material ones—these will have a more lasting impression and teaches your child to value special moments.
If your child wants something, have her earn or at least wait for it instead of giving it at her whim. Avoid exposing her to advertising, especially if she's younger than eight-years-old (and talk about what ads are trying to do if she happens to see a few).
Finally, teach gratitude and the value of giving to others. This reminds her of how blessed she truly is with the life she has.
Raising non materialistic children is important for every parent, regardless of income. It's our way to raise future adults who will value joy not from material items, but from experiences, from others, and from their own intrinsic selves.

Conservative leadership candidate Maxime Bernier out-fundraised his rivals over the summer, raking in $371,000 between July and September, more than the rest of the field combined.
The financial reports posted on Elections Canada's website also show the Liberals raised the most money in the last quarter, while the Conservatives and New Democrats had their worst fundraising quarters in five years.
Quebec MP Maxime Bernier raised $370,605.89 from 1,838 contributors in the third quarter of 2016, out-pacing the other contestants who were officially in the running for the Conservative leadership at the time.
Kellie Leitch, who had raised the most money in the second quarter of the year, raised $215,635.97 from 811 contributors. Her total of $450,421.56 raised so far in the campaign, still puts the Ontario MP at the top of the list.
But Bernier's successful quarter has him nipping at her heels, with a total of $427,508.72 raised between April and September.
Michael Chong raised $124,224.34 from 243 contributors, bringing his total for the campaign to $208,913.72.
Fellow Ontario MP Tony Clement, who withdrew from the contest earlier this month citing his fundraising difficulties, raised just $20,080.00 from 26 contributors.
Deepak Obhrai, an Alberta MP, raised only $1,100 from two contributors.
No fundraising data was available for official leadership contestants Chris Alexander, Steven Blaney, Erin O'Toole, Andrew Scheer and Brad Trost, who either entered the race after the end of the third quarter reporting period or had no fundraising during the summer to report.
Fundraising down for all parties
The Liberals raised the most money over the summer, taking in $3,223,064.85 from 35,180 contributors. Still, that was down about $1.7 million from the previous quarter and the lowest amount of money raised by the Liberals since the second quarter of 2014.
Fundraising was also down for the two opposition parties.
The Conservative Party raised $3,131,308.24 from 29,073 individual contributors, down about $1.9 million from the second quarter. It was their slightest fundraising haul since the third quarter of 2011, though the leadership contest may have tapped donors who would otherwise have contributed to the party coffers.
Including contributions made to the leadership contestants, the Tories brought in a total of about $3.9 million. The last time the Conservatives raised less than $4 million was in 2013.
The New Democrats saw their fundraising slide for the fourth consecutive quarter, dipping to $972,607.03 raised from 14,553 contributors. That is down just under $111,000 from the second quarter of 2016 and the NDP's worst result since the third quarter of 2011.
The Green Party raised $514,728.20 from 7,008 contributors, while the Bloc Québécois raised $99,732.58 from 874 contributors.

Best Buy today said it would open a technology development center in South Lake Union, taking the top floor of the Seattle Times Building. Set to begin operations in late spring, the office will employ more than 50 engineers, product managers, web architects and developers in the next year and is expected to expand to more than 100 e-commerce professionals over time.
I met this morning with Mary Lou Kelley, president of Best Buy e-commerce, Bala Subramanian, chief technology officer, and Jeff Shelman, director of communications for the Minneapolis-based retailer. They said the company had looked at several cities before settling on Seattle because of its technology base, talent, cloud engineering and e-commerce strengths. An initial batch of 30 jobs was posted today.
“The work done in this office will lead the transformation of the omnichannel experience for our customers,” Kelley said. “We intend for our colleagues in this office to drive breakthrough innovation at incredible scale – for the world's largest consumer electronics retailer.”
The state kicked in $200,000 in incentives from Gov. Jay Inslee's strategic reserve fund, along with expedited permitting. In a prepared statement, Inslee said,
Best Buy is an exciting addition to Washington state's powerful community of e-commerce and mobile technology innovators here in the Cloud Capital of the World. We're proud to have this dynamic, leading-edge company bringing great jobs and drawing on the talents of our outstanding tech workforce, which numbers more than 176,000, including some of the best cloud-application developers anywhere.
When up and running, the 32,000-square-foot Seattle center will be the second e-commerce engineering site, along with one in Minneapolis.
Best Buy already has one of the most trafficked e-commerce sites, accounting for $1.49 billion in online sales this past holiday season. The company is in the third year of a successful turnaround under CEO Hubert Joly. A key element to future growth is its e-commerce omnichannel, which aims to reach customers in stores, online or via their mobile phones. This will be a key focus of the engineers and developers here.
“We're uniquely positioned with 1,400 stores and we want to use e-commerce to drive true innovation,” Kelley said. “Customers still want to see, feel and touch products, but they also want to digital.”
The Seattle Times Building at 1000 Denny is owned by H5 Capital of California.

RSA Chairman: NSA Work Is 'Public Record'
Art Coviello calls for global intelligence community reforms, says RSA's work with NSA was never secret.
RSA CONFERENCE 2014 -- San Francisco -- RSA Security executive chairman Art Coviello, in his keynote address at the annual RSA Conference Tuesday, addressed publicly for the first time the security company's relationship with the National Security Agency (NSA), which he said mainly has entailed working with NSA's Information Assurance Directorate (IAD), the cyberdefense arm of the agency.
Coviello stopped short of specifically addressing details of the December Reuters report that the NSA in 2006 had paid RSA $10 million in a secret contract to use the Dual EC DRBG random-number generator algorithm in its Bsafe software in order to facilitate the NSA's spying programs. The encryption algorithm reportedly was one that the NSA was able to crack.
[For more from RSA, see RSA Conference 2014: Complete Coverage.]
"We've been doing business with the NSA for a long time. It's a matter of public record," Coviello said in an interview with Dark Reading after his keynote. "We have worked with the IAD on the defense side of the house. My purpose in the speech was to really get us past the NSA issue and the raise the level of the dialogue."
In a Dec. 22 blog post responsing to allegations of an NSA secret contract, RSA dismissed reports that it had a secret pact with the NSA, stating that "we have never entered into any contract or engaged in any project with the intention of weakening RSA's products, or introducing potential 'backdoors' into our products for anyone's use."

A judge overseeing Prince's mammoth estate ordered Monday that the affidavits from people claiming to be his heirs — and the special administrator's responses to them — be sealed until further notice.
Carver County Judge Kevin Eide issued the order without a public hearing just a week before he's scheduled to hear arguments over the genetic testing protocols that have been established by Bremer Trust, the special administrator, for determining “heirship” to the estate, which has been valued at $100 million to $300 million.
The attorneys for one of the potential heirs filed an objection to Eide's May 18 order approving the protocols, which will be considered at a June 27 hearing.
Bremer Trust and several parties to the case have objected to requests by news organizations, including the Star Tribune, for audiovisual coverage of the hearing.
At least one potential heir — an 11-year-old girl — and her aunt have asked that the hearing be closed to the public on all matters related to heirship.
Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago attorney representing the girl, said he doesn't want the girl — identified in court papers only as V.Y.N. — to be publicly identified.
Prince, found dead on April 21, left an estimated $100 million to $300 million estate.
“The number of people out there that are harassing and haranguing my client and some of the other heirs is simply off the charts,” Stoltmann said.
He said some of the information likely to be discussed in court about the girl's aunt and her purported relationship to Prince are of a “personal nature.”
Eide's order sealed 11 affidavits that were filed by people claiming to be Prince's heirs and four others filed to substantiate some of those claims.
Media seek access
“It is cause for concern any time a court decides to seal records that are presumptively public or to bar the public from observing court proceedings,” said Leita Walker, an attorney representing the Star Tribune.
“In this case in particular, it is hard to see how the privacy interests of individuals who have voluntarily inserted themselves into the probate proceeding outweigh the public's right to know how the courts are handling the large estate of Minnesota's most famous celebrity,” Walker said. “Media organizations here and across the country are watching this case carefully and are prepared to intervene if the access rights of the press or the public are infringed.”
Bremer Trust and its attorneys declined to comment. In court filings, they took no position on whether the hearing should be closed to the public, but they argued that audiovisual coverage of paternity issues “would not be appropriate.”
“No matter how the Court ultimately assesses the public interest in this probate proceeding, the Special Administrator requests that the Court also give due consideration to the desire of the family to not have their sensitive family histories and discussions regarding those histories broadcast to the world,” Bremer's lawyers wrote.
Please, no ‘circus'
Stoltmann said that coverage of celebrity hearings such as O.J. Simpson's trial on murder charges shows that “cameras in the courtroom often turn these proceedings into a glorified circus.”
The first Prince probate hearing drew dozens of reporters from the news media and trade press.
Prince's family members and their attorneys had to be escorted by sheriff's deputies through a media gantlet to their vehicles afterward.
Attorneys for other potential heirs who objected to audiovisual coverage could not be reached Monday.

She's the thing that monsters have nightmares about.
Into every generation a Slayer is born: one girl in all the world, a Chosen One . She alone will wield the strength and skill to fight the vampires, demons, and the forces of darkness; to stop the spread of their evil and the swell of their numbers. She is the Slayer.
Advertisement:
In 1992, Joss Whedon wrote a somewhat decent if largely forgotten film about a bog standard trope: the fragile (and doomed) blonde cheerleader attacked by monsters in a dark alley. In a postmodern twist the blonde cheerleader is the "Slayer," a powerful warrior that the monsters are afraid of meeting in dark alleys. Since Whedon, a mere writer, lacked creative control over his work, he viewed the actual film as a disappointment (though still entertaining). Not wanting the character and overall concept to go to waste, and given the opportunity to re-visit it as a television series, he wasted no time in saying "yes."
In 1997, the fledgling WB network raised Buffy the Vampire Slayer from the dead with an abbreviated first season. The pilot treats the motion picture as originally scripted (not the film that resulted) as canon: Buffy learns that she is the most recent in a line of warrior women chosen by fate to fight evil, and in a pitched battle sets the school gym on fire to kill the vampires inside. She can't fully explain this to the authorities, making her a social pariah. Hoping to elude her Slayer responsibilities, she and her mother move to Sunnydale, a sleepy town in Southern California. In spite of that, she learns Sunnydale is sitting on top of a Hellmouth, a well of evil that attracts all types of demons. She is assigned a "Watcher" from an Ancient Conspiracy dedicated to finding and training Slayers. Forming a tight-knit group of friends, Buffy battles hellspawn while juggling her double life as a carefree schoolgirl. That last part is easier than it sounds, as Sunnydale's adults are too wrapped up in lawn care (and denial) to acknowledge the evil brewing right under their feet. Since demons on Buffy are walking metaphors for existing evils — reptilian authority figures, suddenly-soulless boyfriends, and so on — the B-horror trappings take on an entirely new meaning, usually with a sly feminist wink inserted.

The show didn't catch fire in its first season, but did garner enough critical acclaim to attract viewers by year two. However, Buffy (and Angel) were not inexpensive shows to produce, and neither were expected to grow beyond their cult demographic. Although WB attempted to shove Buffy off the air in 2001, it was picked up by UPN in time for Season 6 and 7. The jump was heralded by Buffy's literal death and resurrection, along with a ratings-grabbing ad campaign.
The show pioneered the Half-Arc Season, with a singular villain behind that year's events, and signposted a few major plot developments months (and even years) in advance. Perhaps most surprisingly, the central cast grew like kudzu, with even walk-on roles getting a dose of character development much later on... Just in time for Joss to kill them off, alas.

Nobody can deny or ignore the influence of Buffy on the TV shows that followed it, both within and outside the genre. (Russell T. Davies had at least one eye on this show when he revived Doctor Who.) This series has become one of the most Trope Overdosed and Lampshaded shows in existence — thousands of references to Buffy exist across this entire wiki — partially because TV Tropes began with a specific focus on Buffy (based on a 2004 thread on the fan site Buffistas.org) before branching out to all TV and eventually all everything. However, we no longer consider this show as merely Trope Overdosed — we now officially classify it as kiloWick and one of The Truly Awesome. With over 7,000 wicks and a runtime of 6,056 minutes, this page (well, this entry and its metapages) now has over one wick per minute.
Has an episode crowner here.
Tie-ins and Possible Reboot
Buffy remains Joss Whedon's mothership series, with numerous tie-in novels, merchandise, video games, and spinoffs in the offing (see Fray ), though plans for a Spike and/or Giles TV show remain in Development Hell . In 2001, Joss even tried shopping around an animated series based on the show, but most networks felt it wasn't suitable for small kids.
In 1999, Joss and co-producer David Greenwalt conceived a spin-off starring Buffy's vampiric love interest, Angel — the He-Man to Buffy's She-Ra, if you will. While Buffy focused on adolescent woe, Angel revolved around stressed-out twenty-somethings in thankless jobs, trying to hold onto their youthful ideals. Angel ended the only way it could have: the gang sold out and become Corporate Sponsored Superheroes, much to the disgust of Buffy and her allies, who disavowed them. Crossovers and cross-references between the two shows persisted even after Buffy ended in 2003.
In 2007 Buffy started up again — in comic form. Produced by Joss Whedon, it encompasses four "Seasons" of TV time so far, ultimately coming to an end in 2018 due to Dark Horse comics losing the license which in turn finally ended the original continuity of the series. Boom Studio picks it up later and initiated a full Continuity Reboot to begin in 2019. In 2011, the mainline series branched off into Angel & Faith, which is London-based (in a nod to Excalibur).
There was also a few stand alone comics based on Buffy's high school days, being much Lighter and Softer then the source material, it only got three books and was forced to end due to the aforementioned losing of the licensee by Dark Horse. Bizarrely, the series likewise got an all ages story set in it's own continuity, Buffy: New School Nightmare, in which she once more arrives in a new town and has to contend with vampires, joined along the way by a witch and a werewolf Sarafina and Alvaro and a new, female watcher named Ms. Sparks guiding her. In this version, Buffy is much younger (12) and the vampires are all silly ones from various eras (in fact there isn't any kid vampire at all). While it does mention death and what not (with even Santa Claus being a vampire) it never gets as dark as it's mainstream counterpart and is even Lighter and Softer then the Stand Alone "High School Years" series. A sequel to this continuity is said to be in the works.
The producers of the original film (the Kuzui couple listed in the credits) retained the rights to Buffy throughout the show's run despite having no creative involvement past the film. Plans have been proposed to revive/remake the film without Joss Whedon's input. No one involved with the series had anything pleasant to say about it.

After two years of debate – and almost four hours of discussion Tuesday night – the Vallejo City Council finally made a decision about medical marijuana dispensaries operating within the city of Vallejo.
In a series of four motions, the council first decided in a 5-2 vote to shut down all MMDs in the city – even if they are complying with the Measure C tax.
In 2011, city voters approved Measure C, which imposes a business license tax rate of 10 percent on the sales of medical marijuana products within the city.
According to a recent city staff report, 11 MMDs were maintaining an active tax certificate out of the 26 known to be operating within the city.
“This is not going to say that we are going to allow them or ban them but close all of them down now, period,” said Vallejo Mayor Osby Davis before the vote on his motion.
“Even if you are going to regulate, we still have to shut them down,” he also said.
Councilman Robert McConnell stated that he couldn”t support the motion without more information about the legal ratifications of shutting down all the MMDs.
McConnell and fellow councilwoman Katy Miessner voted against the motion.
Then things became more interesting, as Davis followed up with another motion – to ban all MMDs inside the city, with Davis, Bob Sampayan, Pippin Dew-Costa and Jess Malgapo voting to ban.
Seconds after the vote, Sampayan informed the council that he had “erred in his vote.”
“I can”t let you err in your vote,” Davis said to Sampayan. “I will let you vote again.”
The former vice-mayor was the only one to switch his vote, causing the motion to go down in defeat 4-3, with Robert McConnell, Rozzana Verder-Aliga and Katy Miessner also opposed.
Many in attendance clapped loudly to the defeat of the motion, prompting Davis to address the crowd.
“I know you guys are excited but you know it will help us get through and get home if you guys don”t interrupt with applause,” said Davis as the council voted around midnight.
The council then unanimously approved a motion, proffered by McConnell, for city staff to bring recommendations back to the council on the regulation of MMDs inside city limits. The study session is expected to take place during the second meeting in March.
Davis then offered the final MMD motion of the night – to stop issuing Measure C tax certificates to new applicants and stop renewing certificates to MMDs which hold a valid tax certificate.
“I think that sends a double message,” Davis said about shutting down all MMDs but still renewing tax certificates to MMDs which hold valid Measure C tax certificates.
After the motion was approved 6-1, with McConnell opposed, Davis addressed the crowd: “Now you can clap if you want to.”
Prior to deciding the issue of MMDs in the city, the council heard from several speakers, ranging from citizens opposed to the dispensaries, lawyers who work on behalf of MMDs, to owners of MMDs operating inside the city, to property owners, and local religious figures.
Vallejo City Unified School District Superintendent Ramona Bishop also presented on the number of self-reported marijuana use from seventh-, ninth- and 11th-graders within the district.
Bishop said that 83 percent of seventh-graders last year never tried marijuana, with 63 percent of ninth-graders having never tried the drug, and 41 percent of 11th graders who self reported never partaking of the drug.
“When I talk with parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, it is the case that they are concerned,” she said. “In many cases, they don”t know where the drugs are coming from; we deal with it at in our high schools on a regular basis.”
Late in public comment, Vallejo resident Jack Davis spoke about his use of medical marijuana.
“I have heart failure, Grave”s disease, diabetes … I have asthma and six herniated discs in my back and marijuana has saved my life,” Jack Davis said as he addressed the council, leaning on a cane. “I”m just asking for the right to live, as everyone here.”
Davis said that he couldn”t afford other pain medication.
Prior to addressing the MMD issue, the council approved an agreement between the city, the county and the Humane Society of the North Bay for the improvement of animal services inside city limits.
“I just ask you to show the same compassion to me and to others in need as you showed to those poor animals,” he said with his voice cracking with emotion.
According to staff, Measure C did not legalize the zoning of MMDs in the Vallejo Municipal Code and thus, in 2013 the council adopted a moratorium which stated that MMDs are not allowed in any zone of the city and new Measure C tax certificates would not be issued.
The moratorium was extended in April 2014 and was set to expire in April.

Web accessibility doesn't only extend to color blind users, but dyslexic users too. Dyslexia is a learning disability that impairs a person's fluency or accuracy in being able to read, write, and spell [10].
As designers, we can help dyslexic users read text better by avoiding the bad design practices that hurt them. Seeing things from their eyes can give us a better perspective on why accessible design is so important.
When dyslexic users read text, sometimes they can experience visual distortion effects [5]. These effects vary in degree from person to person, but they can make reading text that much harder.
Below are six bad practices that are likely to cause these visual distortion effects for dyslexic users. These bad practices can also make reading difficult for non-dyslexic users. But the effect they have on dyslexic users is much worse.
River Effect
Dyslexic users may sometimes see the river effect in the text they're reading [1]. This is when large gaps occur within consecutive lines of text. It can look like a river of whitespace flowing down the words on a page. There are a couple bad practices that make the river effect happen.
1. Justified text
Justified text is not only difficult to read for dyslexic users, but for non-dyslexic users as well. This is because it creates large uneven spaces between letters and words [8]. When these spaces line up above one another, a distracting river of whitespace can appear [4].
This can cause dyslexic readers to repeatedly lose their place when reading [6]. You can avoid creating the river effect by using left-aligned text, instead of justified text for your paragraphs [2].
2. Double-spacing after periods
Most of us have a habit of double-spacing after periods at the end of a sentence. This practice originates from the typewriting days of the past. Typewriters used monospaced fonts back then. Because of this, people thought that double-spacing after periods would make the end of sentences more distinct [9].
But single spacing after periods is enough because most websites use proportionally spaced fonts. Double-spacing after a period can create “rivers” within text that make it difficult for users to find the end of sentences [9]. On the web, single spacing wins.
Blur Effect
Another kind of visual distortion effect that can occur among dyslexic users is the blur effect [1]. This is when dyslexic readers see their text blurring or swirling or together [5]. This can significantly affect a dyslexic user's reading ability, and make reading tiring for them [7]. You can lessen this effect by avoiding a couple of bad practices.
3. Pure black text on a pure white background
There's a reason the text you're reading now is not pure black (#000000), and the background is not pure white (#FFFFFF). It's because many dyslexic users are sensitive to the brightness the high contrast colors cause. This can cause the words to swirl or blur together [3].
To avoid this, use an off-white color for your background, like light gray or tan. You can also use a dark gray for your text instead of pure black to cut the glare even more.
4. Long blocks of unbroken paragraphs
Long blocks of unbroken paragraph text are not only hard for dyslexic users to read, but for non-dyslexic users too. It's easy for dyslexic readers to lose their place with long paragraphs [1].
That's why it's better to use short paragraphs that express one idea [2]. This is because dyslexic users need more breaks between ideas than non-dyslexic users [6]. Breaking up your text to one idea per paragraph makes reading a lot easier for both dyslexic and non-dyslexic users.
Washout Effect
Sometimes dyslexic users can experience the washout effect. When this happens, the text looks faint and indistinct [5]. This can make reading slower and cause dyslexic users to guess what a word is because of the difficulty seeing it. To lessen this effect, there are two bad practices you should avoid with your text.
5. Serif fonts
Serif fonts have hooks at the ends of the letter strokes. They may look decorative, but they can cause reading problems for dyslexic users. Serifs tend to obscure the shapes of letters, making the letters run together [1].
But a sans-serif font would allow dyslexic users to see the shapes of letters clearer. This is because a lack of hooks increases the spacing between letters and makes them more distinguishable [6].
6. Italicized text
Italics are sometimes used to highlight text. But you shouldn't use italicized text because they make letters hard to read. The letters have a jagged line compared to non-italic fonts. The letters also lean over making it hard for dyslexic users to make out the words [6].
When the text size is small, italicized text is even more illegible [3]. A better way to highlight is to use bold text because the letters are clearer and give better contrast.
Accessibility for All
Many users suffer from dyslexia and have trouble reading text. You should make your website accessible to everyone by fixing these bad practices. You got a glimpse of how dyslexic users experience the web. It's not easy to get information when you read with visual distortion. Everyone has the right to information, whether they're dyslexic or not.

[Kripthor] sent us a link to his blog where he writes the Hello World of low-level networking. Basically he's constructing his own packet and sending it. By itself this isn't a bad thing. You could use this power for all sorts of networks-diagnostic good. And so, despite the ominous name of his blog post “ESP8266 Jamming”, he's not really doing anything that bad — he's just creating many fake WiFi beacon frames and sending them out every so often.
Which can apparently do bad things to some vulnerable routers. Who knew? Want to test yours?
Naturally we wanted to see how he was doing it, and we opened up the Arduino code in GitHub. It turns out that Espressif has written a wifi_send_pkt_freedom() function that just sends out whatever packet you'd like to the network. That was easy.
It also turns out that the ESP8266 will enter monitor mode, where it listens to all WiFi traffic regardless of the MAC address that it's directed toward. [Pulkin] seems to have done the work for us and posted the code in his GitHub. Now things get nasty. Combining promiscuous monitor mode with some carefully constructed management frames can end up with a classic WiFi deauth denial-of-service attack on a $2 piece of hardware.
We think it's tremendously cool that the ESP8266 packs such power, and we beg you all to use it responsibly. The last thing we want to see is the world littered with WiFi-DOS throwies. And the last thing you'd want is a visit from the FCC.

Objective Main objective of this blog post is to give you an idea about how to use Music Visualization in Unity.
You will get Final Output:
The image below will give you a better idea on what will be the outcome at the end.
Step 1 Create Project
Create a new project named “Music Visualization” in Unity 2D.
Step 2 White Color Strip
Take a small strip with white color.
You can download it from here.
Step 3 Make Prefab
Make the prefab of the strip.
For getting more information about prefab click here.
Step 4 Apply Prefab
Now, drag that prefab into the scene, we need 64 objects of that prefab.
Now, set all the objects parallel to each other as shown below.
Note :
You can use a number of objects according to your own logic.
In this example, I have used 44 objects with an array of size = 64(44<64).
Step 5 Create Script
Create a new C# script and give it a name, BarVisulization.cs.
BarVisulization.cs:
Using UnityEngine; using System.Collections; using UnityEngine.UI; [RequireComponent(typeof(AudioSource))] public class BarVisulization : MonoBehaviour { public AudioClip[] clips; public SpriteRenderer[] barsSprites; public Slider musicSlider; [Range(0,10)] public float colorMultiplyer = 1; [Range(0,1)] public float s = 1; [Range(0,1)] public float v = 1; private int index = 0; private float musicLength; void Update () { Visulization (); if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown (0)) { ChangeSound (); } MusicSlider(); } void Visulization () { float[] musicData = audio.GetSpectrumData (64, 0, FFTWindow.Triangle); int i = 0; while (i clips.Length - 1) { index = 0; } print (index); audio.clip = clips [index]; audio.Play (); } #region Static public static Color HSVtoRGB (float hue, float saturation, float value, float alpha) { while (hue > 1f) { hue -= 1f; } while (hue 1f) { saturation -= 1f; } while (saturation 1f) { value -= 1f; } while (value 0.999f) { hue = 0.999f; } if (hue 0.999f) { saturation = 0.999f; } if (saturation 0.999f) { value = 0.999f; } if (value < 0.001f) { value = 0.001f; } float h6 = hue * 6f; if (h6 == 6f) { h6 = 0f; } int ihue = (int)(h6); float p = value * (1f - saturation); float q = value * (1f - (saturation * (h6 - (float)ihue))); float t = value * (1f - (saturation * (1f - (h6 - (float)ihue)))); switch (ihue) { case 0: return new Color (value, t, p, alpha); case 1: return new Color (q, value, p, alpha); case 2: return new Color (p, value, t, alpha); case 3: return new Color (p, q, value, alpha); case 4: return new Color (t, p, value, alpha); default: return new Color (value, p, q, alpha); } } #endregion }
Notes:
float [ ] musicData = audio.GetSpectrumData (64, 0, FFTWindow.Triangle);
This function gives a float array with Spectrum value of the audio clip. For more information, click here.
Here, I have used HSVtoRGB() function that converts HSVcolor to RGB color.
HSV colors are easy to understand. To know more about HSV colors, click here.
Step 6 Apply Script
Drag the script to an empty object.
Select all 44 Bar Gameobjects and drag them on barSprites (reference to the public array barSprites, declared in BarVisulization.cs file).
Step 7 Set Camera
Set Camera background color to some dark color.
Step 8 Audio Clip
You will also need some audio clips for demonstration.
Import your audio files into your project and drag all of them on to the clips. (reference to the public array clips, declared in BarVisulization.cs file).
Step 9 Test
Now, you are ready to go. Press the play button and enjoy your music with lots of different colors on your bar sprites.
I hope you find this blog post very helpful while using Music Visualization in Unity. Let me know in comment if you have any questions regarding Unity. I will reply you ASAP.

Irina Rodnina tweeted doctored photo of US leader with fruit – in country where black athletes are taunted with them regularly
The subject of racism has become the focus of a public discussion in Russia after an MP from the Duma caused outrage by posting an image of Barack Obama on Twitter that was photoshopped to include a banana.
Irina Rodnina, an MP from Vladimir Putin's United Russia party and a triple Olympic champion figure-skater, posted the picture on her personal Twitter account.
The image features Obama chewing, while a hand in the foreground waves a banana at him.
Rodnina insisted that there was nothing wrong with the photograph, and said she had been sent it by friends in America. "Freedom of speech is freedom of speech, and you should answer for your own hang-ups," she wrote.
The doctored photograph of the US president looking at a banana that was posted on Twitter. Photograph: www.propagandes.info
The US ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, wrote on Twitter that Rodnina was guilty of "outrageous behaviour, which only brings shame to her parliament and country". A spokesperson for the US embassy quoted Thomas Jefferson in response to the tweet: "Bigotry is the disease of ignorance."
Racism is rife in Russia, and black football players often face racial abuse involving bananas. In 2011, the Brazilian Roberto Carlos, playing for Russian team Anzhi Makhachkala, left the pitch in anger after a banana was thrown at him from the stands. In a separate incident, the club Zenit St Petersburg was fined the equivalent of about £6,300 when a fan offered Carlos a banana before a match.
Rodnina, who lived in the US for many years, deleted the photograph but has not apologised and remains unfazed by accusations of racism. Instead, she suggested that the wave of criticism she prompted from liberal journalists and other Russians was a conspiracy.
She implied on Twitter that the criticism was a campaign ordered by opposition politician Alexei Navalny. "Are there still some of you who haven't had their say on Daddy Navalny's orders?"
Navalny is a stringent Kremlin critic who earlier this month won 27% of the vote in Moscow mayoral elections, and who has himself been accused of racist statements.
The incident was widely discussed in the Russian press, with many commentators coming to the defence of the MP and figure skater.
"What Irina Konstantinovna put on Twitter is her business; it is her own personal space," wrote the pro-Kremlin television presenter Vladimir Soloviev in a Moscow freesheet on Monday. "This is not a big scandal."
He claimed that the reaction was oversensitive and that the photograph was not racist.
"I advise everyone who attacked her that the next time they go out for a coffee, they should not call it a black coffee but an African-American coffee."
The Virginia State Water Control Board approved Thursday Dominion Virginia Power's permits to drain defunct coal ash ponds into nearby waterways at two sites in the state. The Possum Point power station is near Quantico and will be drained into a tributary of the Potomac River and the Bremo Bluff power station will be drained into a tributary of the James River on which its located near Palmyra — despite opposition from hundreds of public commenters and almost two dozen state and local agencies.
Potomac Riverkeeper Dean Naujoks said his organization, represented by the Southern Environmental Law Center, plans to appeal the decision at Possum Point, and SELC has opposed the permits at both sites.
“The water board got it wrong,” Naujoks said on his way back from the hearing in Richmond on Thursday. “They failed the public today.”
The groups, along with the Sierra Club, already had filed a notice of intent to sue over the presence of outdated coal ash ponds near Quantico Creek's intersection with the Potomac River in Northern Virginia when the power plant announced plans in November to drain them into nearby waters.
Dominion's transition from coal power stations to natural gas has left behind ponds where coal ash is stored with water at a handful of sites in the state.
The Water Control Board approved both permit changes with a 5-1 vote in what were the first major decisions surrounding the draining of coal ash ponds in the state. Unused ash ponds are also located at the Chesapeake Energy Center on the Elizabeth River.
Greg Buppert, a senior attorney at SELC, said he sees the decisions as a misapplication of the Clean Water Act, which requires states to use the best available technologies to prevent pollution.
“The permit authorizes concentrations of metals like arsenic many times greater than [the levels] that can be achieved with the available technology,” he said of the Possum Point decision before stepping back in to participate in the Bremo power station hearing.
A byproduct of burning coal for power, the ash is one of the most ubiquitous types of industrial waste, with more than 100 million tons of it produced in the United States in 2012, according to the EPA. Coal ash contains toxins such as arsenic, lead and mercury that can be harmful to human and environmental health.
The Potomac River supplies drinking water to millions of people in the Washington, D.C. metro area. Among the concerns raised by the public and agencies were questions about how far coal ash contamination might travel in the tidal waters of the Potomac.
Regarding the Possum Point decision, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality recommended that the State Water Control Board approve Dominion's changed permit to drain the ponds, saying the toxins contained in the waters would be within state and federal limits. At a hearing in December, Buppert said that those levels are far above limits set by other states and more than six times the state's own chronic toxicity standard for aquatic life.
Martin Gary, executive secretary of the Potomac River Fisheries Commission, expounded on the potential impact of the permitted discharges on local aquatic life at the hearing. The Commission already had raised concerns about toxic discharges in an area that is “located at the heart of a historical spawning reach for the Atlantic striped bass,” but Gary added that recent fisheries surveys have found Atlantic sturgeon — listed as endangered in the Chesapeake Bay by the National Marine Fisheries Service — near Quantico Creek's intersection with the Potomac.
The Maryland Department of Natural Resources also wrote a new 8-page letter to the Water Control Board opposing the permit. The letter details the impact that heavy metals and other toxins present in coal ash can have on aquatic and human health in and along the states' shared river and the Chesapeake Bay.
Their letter of opposition joined nearly 500 other public comments issued during the comment period, in which almost 20 public agencies participated and several state and local lawmakers.
To learn more about the project, read our previous coverage about the public hearing in Woodbridge in December and organization's first indications that they might sue early last year.
The South Park game is actually finished. It's gone gold. For real. Publisher Ubisoft just announced that South Park: The Stick of Truth will actually be out on March 4, for PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
Of course, this might still be a practical joke. After all the difficulties and delays, we might want to hold off on declaring Stick of Truth to be a real game until it's actually in our hands. Still, though. This is exciting.
Developed by Obsidian Games, the folks behind RPGs like Fallout: New Vegas and Alpha Protocol, South Park: The Stick of Truth looks and feels like a cross between South Park and Paper Mario, which basically makes it my fantasy game. I haven't been this excited about a new video game in a very long time.
The Mayor of Deerfield Beach, Florida, Jean Robb, could be removed from office after the State Ethics Commission found “probably cause” that she misused her office to benefit her church.
The alleged violations include:
— Giving her pastor a beach parking sticker reserved for city employees.
— Telling city officials involved in code enforcement to back off a luxury automobile dealership because the owner donated “two $500 checks” to her favorite charities.
— Having the city clean up her church's parking lot after an event.
There's more where that came from, but none of it looks good.
Robb served as mayor from 1980 to 1993. She was elected once again in 2013 and is up for re-election next year. If the Ethics Commission finds her guilty of these violations, she may be forced to step down from her position.
But maybe the most interesting aspect of this story is the person who filed these charges in the first place: Chaz Stevens, the Satanist activist best known for putting up a Festivus pole in the State Capitol and erecting other provocative displays on government property.
his prayers have been answered. “Satan and I are vindicated,” said the church-state separation activist, who has spurred cities to drop religious invocations by applying to lead one to Satan.
I'm glad Satan is happy.
Given all the criticism of Stevens' displays, it's important to remember that activism takes many forms and you might disagree with some of them. But this is a wonderful example of a citizen taking action when a government official abuses the system. If Robb is found guilty, Stevens deserves all the credit for making it happen.

A report released by the Moral Philosophy Research Group this week confirms what many have long suspected: Sean Hannity's commentary is entirely devoid of cognitive content. “Yes, except we mean it literally,” says Anthony Vega, the report's lead author. “When Hannity utters a sentence, he's not asserting a proposition that might be true or false – he's simply expressing an attitude.”
The researchers first became interested in Hannity after noticing a startling contrast between his apparently successful use of language and what seemed to be a never-ending string of blatant falsehoods. “Most of what he says seems to be demonstrably false,” Vega notes, “and yet he engages in these back-and-forth exchanges in which his guests somehow just don't seem to care. I found myself wondering: What if Sean Hannity isn't even in the business of describing reality?”
The hypothesis turned out to yield remarkable success in interpreting many of Hannity's otherwise puzzling statements, Vega says. Consider, for instance, Hannity's repeated claim that America has the greatest health care system on Earth. “There's just no plausible standard by which that could be true,” explains Vega. “What he's really saying is: ‘USA! USA!' It's a little more obvious when he says things like: ‘The US is the greatest, best country God has ever given man on the face of the earth.' This particular pro-attitude is a common theme for him.”
Hannity's locutions often manifest the superficial grammatical and logical properties indicative of assertions, Vega continues, “which is probably why he's typically interpreted as at least making an attempt at engaging in reasoned discourse. But don't be fooled: his goal isn't actually to describe some mind-independent realm of facts – much less to present others with reasons for believing his claims about those facts.” The full report, “A Non-Cognitive Analysis of Sean Hannity,” is available for download on the Moral Philosophy Research Group's website.
[Speaking of assertion, I've just had a paper on assertion and epistemic regress accepted for publication in Thought. You can read the abstract and download the paper here.]

Michael Bradley's 81st minute winner for Roma away to Udinese on Sunday afternoon was an historic moment. It enabled Roma to notch up their ninth consecutive win at the start of a Serie A season. This feat has only been achieved once in Italy, via Juventus in the 2005/06 season, or never before, if you prefer not to see an asterisk when looking at past achievments.
With not hours enough in the week I'll confess to not having seen much of Roma this season but I thought I would see what my numbers can tell us about their wonderful start.
Defence
A cursory look at the league table will tell us that with just 1 goal conceded in 9 games Rudi Garcia has ensured that Roma has delivered an almost perfect defensive performance. As is our style, we need to go a little further into the numbers to see if the concession of single goal has been deserved or whether they have been the beneficiary of large chunks of good fortune.
Defensive Shot Chart
Roma's defensive shot chart is impressive. Although the concession of 107 shots (excluding penalties) is good, it places them in just 4th place in terms of the fewest amount of shots allowed in Serie A. Juventus top the table with a really stingy total of just 70 shots given up during their first 9 games; Sampdoria and Inter complete the teams that have conceded fewer shots than the league leaders.
Roma's defensive strength has been in the way that they have forced the opposition to take long range shots. Only 21% of shots against them have come from the Prime Zone (defined below); this figure is the lowest in the league.
Their staunch defending around the areas of the penalty area can be further seen by the fact that by allowing just 27% of their shots conceded to be hit from the Secondary zone, they ensure that a massive 51% (roundings) of shots targeted at Morgan De Sanctis originated from the two outside zones. Inter trail a long way behind in second place in this metric at 41%.
So, in terms of defensive shooting zones Roma have been superb. In fact, so good have they been at preventing teams from taking shots at goals from favourable positions that they have the lowest average ExpG value per shot conceded in the Big 5 leagues this season.
ExpG Values
To expand a little on ExpG for those unfamiliar with the concept, we assign a probability of each shot being scored. This probability is determined with reference to all of the information that we have about a shot; the information is obtained from Squawka and StatsZone.
There's obviously something special going on with this team in terms of defence. This can be seen in the chart below which plots the average ExpG values for the teams across all Big 5 leagues that have have had the lowest average ExpG values for the shots they have conceded.
Not only do Roma lead this measure, which is quite a feat in itself, but the difference they have over the other leading teams is clear to see. Even with removing the scale on the y axis, we can see how closely bunched the teams that follow behind Roma are on this measure. This is always a really good indicator of a team that is head and shoulders clear of the chasing pack.
Other than the shooting opportunities they give up, if I was to point out one other facet of the defensive play that they have excelled it, it would be their ability to block shots.
Roma have blocked 41% of all shots they have allowed. Only one other team in Italy has blocked more than 30% of the opposition shots, Catania at a clip of 32%.
This large amount of blocked shots leads to an interesting anomaly. De Sanctis, as the Roma goalkeeper, has saved just 17% of shots taken. Unbelievably, with just 18 saves he has actually had the fewest number of saves in Italy. That is certainly not what you'd expect the goalkeeping stats of the team that has just conceded 1 goal in 9 games to look like.
Defensive Style
It may be as a result of the fact that they have spent huge amounts of time in leading game states, but Roma's defensive style has certainly been one of keeping it tight and compact at the back. They do not press high up the pitch at all, they are content to let the opposition have the ball in non-threatening positions and reorganise themselves in their own half.
Here follows the defensive actions (tackles, interceptions and fouls) carried out by Roma in their last home game, against Napoli.
During this game Roma only had 4 defensive actions (1 foul, 2 interceptions and 1 tackle) in their attacking third. This game was by no means a one off in this regard as they consistently have amongst the fewest defensive actions at the top end of the pitch in Serie A. The proviso here is that we wouldn't expect a team that has led for so many minutes to do much pressing. However, I think this lack of pressing is important as it partly explains why they have been able to block so many of their shots faced this season.
Defensive over performance
However, even with the exceptionally low average ExpG defensive values that they have posted, they have still massively over performed in allowing just 1 goal to be conceded. Based on the objective ExpG calculations Roma would have been expected to have conceded a few more goals on top of that. Given that their goals against tally currently stands at 1 it's not the bravest call in the world to suggest that they will see some regression in the near future. But all I can say, is that they will……..
Outcome of Shots Conceded
The above image shows the location, as well as the outcome for each shot that Roma has conceded. Apart from the sheer volume of dots outside the penalty area what is striking is the 7 blue shots that have been taken from central locations in an around the edge of the 6 yard box. The fact that they are coloured blue means that they missed the target.
The wayward placing of what should be great shooting opportunities for goal scoring from those shots will go a little towards explaining why their concession of just 1 goal is much less than they “should” have conceded.
For what it's worth, according to our ExpG values Juventus should have conceded fewer goals than Roma. Yet the Turin giants have conceded 9 (excluding penalties) to AS Roma's 1. Make of that what you wish.
I'll make just one final comment on the ExpG values of the shots they have conceded. As I have stated in all similar articles, our ExpG values do not take account of defensive pressure. The data that is currently displayed by the likes of Sqauwka and StatsZone do not include any defensive information at all. The data does not know whether there were any defenders pressuring the striker as he took the shot or whether the defensive team had a significant number of defenders back.
As Roma has blocked such a high proportion of the shots they have faced, perhaps the defensive pressure they are exerting on shots they allow is higher than average. If this is the case then the ExpG values that we assign to the shots they conceded may well be over-estimated as our model is not capturing exactly how any given team defends.
Attacking
For me, Roma aren't nearly as interesting going forward as they are in terms of trying to understand how they defend.
Attacking Shot Chart
With just 22% of Roma's shots being hit from Prime Locations they actually have the second lowest proportion of shots from this optimum location in Serie A; Livorno is the only team worse than Roma on this measure. This fact certainly isn't what we'd expect to see of a team that is top of the table.
They have slightly more shots (excluding penalties) than average with 130 against the league average of 119, and this mix of shot quantity with their shot quality results in a forecast position of 9th in the league in terms of ExpG scored. Yes, in terms of the number of goals scored there should have been 8 teams that scored more goals than them, but there has only been one that has actually done this.
It will therefore come as no surprise for me to say that through scoring 18 goals from non-penalty situations they have comfortably exceeded the amount of goals that our model had expected them to score.
The majority of Roma's over performance can be attributed to their long range shooting. Their total of 6 goals from outside the penalty area is a league best total (jointly held with Napoli), this compares with a total ExpG value per our model for these shots of 2 goals. Perhaps their style of play; compact defensive shape and then quick transitions to counter attacking football, means that due to the relative lack of defensive pressure the quality of the chances they create are better than our model gives them credit for.
However, even bearing this in mind I'd be strongly of the opinion that their goals scored tally of 18 (excluding penalties) makes them look much better than their bare numbers would suggest from an attacking point of view.
Placement of Roma's shots
At this early stage of football analystics, not enough work has been done to be able to conclude whether a team or a player can, in general terms, repeat good shot placements. Personally, I think it is reasonable to accept that the very best strikers demonstrate a specific skill which allows them to pick out great shot placements. However, on a team level I'd need some persuasive evidence to suggest that this phenomenon exists.
The above Shot Placement chart suggests that Roma has been very effective at picking out spots that goalkeepers find it difficult to save from. I think this goes a little to explain why their conversion rate is 14%, which is second highest in the league. This is conversion rate is even more astounding when you consider that they have had the second fewest proportion of their shots from Prime shooting locations.
The question is whether they can continue to be as efficient with their shot placements given the distances that they have tended to shoot from.
Summary
So, after my detailed look at Roma I hope that this article will help Statsbomb readers gain a better understanding of how they have managed to capture 27 league points from their opening 9 league games. With that in mind, here's my wrap-up thoughts on their performances to date:
They are doing something very special in defence. The quality of the average chance they concede is the lowest in the Big 5 leagues. That is a serious accolade to have on your mantelpiece.
With a blocked shots percentage of 41% they get a huge amount of bodies backs when defending which constricts the space available to opposition forwards.
But even with these terrific defensive traits they have still over performed significantly in defence to have conceded just one goal. Given the amount of shots they concede their goals against tally will start to increase.
Going forward they appear to be average, with a slightly higher than average volume of shots being offset by generally poor shooting choices.
They seem to have led a charmed life with the number of goals they have scored, especially from long distance shots. I'll be hugely surprised if this continues.

(Wow, this post was saltier than I intended. Still tired from last night I guess.)
Okay, that's fine and all, but that still doesn't justify the worst problems that happened this salty suite.
Who thought the idea of having doubles DURING the salty suite was at all a good idea? The event was already late due to poor organization, so who thought stalling the event longer would be something that people wanted? Not saying GIMR is entirely at fault for this one, but airing doubles right after Mango v Leffen instead of before was a huge failure of the night.
Speaking of organization, an event like this should always be tightly organized. The amount of downtime between each match was painful. GIMR is flat out wrong if he thinks a salty suite where anyone can come up and play is something to get hyped over. Something that CAN and SHOULD be replicated from the Apex SS is the structure. Instead of 10 matches between people with no real beef, it should be a few genuinely salty matches. That way the hype won't die down and people won't be wondering why two of these guys are even on stream.
And you might say that the Evo salty suite was never supposed to be like the Apex one, but seeing how much TK was trying to hype up the crowd, the constant footage of the Apex salty suite beforehand, and the fact that there was a "main event", all seem to say otherwise. It doesn't take a bachelor's in marketing to see that the Evo suite was trying to ride the hype wave set by the Apex one. Even if GIMR did try to stop this misconception from happening, he only really followed through in word but not in action since all the advertising was clearly screaming "Apex Salty Suite 2.0".
Finally to end my little rant, I think we need to consider what we as a community actually want from the Salty Suite. The Apex SS was easily the most hype SS I personally had ever seen, and given the overwhelming disappointment last night, I think the same can be said for many if not most people.
So my biggest problem here is, why not try to make the Apex salty suite the new standard? As we all saw last night, having friendlies on stream and calling them salty is obviously the wrong way to do things. It's boring, and if GIMR thinks that last night was how things should be, then he deserves all of the people calling him out on it.
And I'm not talking about hosting it in a main room, because 30 people can easily be loud and hype enough to emulate that bigger environment. If the crowd is into it, unlike last night, then the stream really won't be able to tell the difference between 30 and 300 people.
As I mentioned before, quality matches over quantity is a must. A few, well advertised matches between salty people is better than pulling a bunch of people from the crowd and expecting everyone to get hyped for it. Doing it this way will also help keep the event more organized. The context of the match is important and just having them do an "anime" call out beforehand isn't enough for the crowd.
Because at the end of the day, it's the matches, and not the suite itself, that are the heart of the Salty Suite. Once you start advertising individual matches beforehand, people will get hyped for watching those matches and not assume the whole Suite will be like Leffen v Chillin.
Easily the two best matches of the night were between Mango/Leffen and Kage/Bizz (although the latter was hurt by being pushed back so late), and, like I'm saying, both of those matches were heavily advertised in advance. In opposition to what GIMR said last night, the salty suite SHOULD be just a series of a few main events. Sure, maybe have some fake salty friendlies in between, but the pacing of last night was terrible with Mango/Leffen at the beginning, then Kage/Bizz 2 whole hours later, and then finally nothing for the rest of the night.
All in all this Salty Suite WAS a disappointment and SHOULD be seen as a failure. It was misadvertised, and held onto an obsolete formula which, in addition to the lack of salt that night, ended up being a bore fest. GIMR definitely has the skill and talent to pull off successful salty suites, but he needs to realize it's not up to him what the community wants to see.
Question:
Assalamu alakum!
My name is Emanne, I am 17 years old. I know that talking to boys alone is haram, but recently I started talking to this guy who used to go to high school with me. He is 20 years old and he is in the U.S. Marines. Right now he is stationed in Japan. At first I was just asking him how his life was going, but slowly we started to talk more and more. Eventually, we both admitted that we liked each other. Now we always say I love you, and I really do love him a lot. He really seems perfect, he loves me so much, he's so kind to me, and he thinks i'm perfect!
My parents don't know we're talking of course. He is Christian right now, but we talked about marriage, and he told me that he would convert to Islam for me if that makes my parents say yes. I know someone should only convert to Islam because of Allah and Islam, but I'm sure eventually he will love Islam and become a good Muslim.
I am a Syrian. My parents are veryyyy very strict about who I should marry. He has to be a Syrian Muslim, and have a good job. My father is a doctor, so they want me to marry a doctor.
I don't know what to do. I really love this guy and I can't imagine myself with anyone else. I can imagine marrying him and having children with him.. So could you please tell me what I should do? Please?
He's visiting in December and then he is going to Afghanistan. Then he will come back and stay in America after half a year.. I have considered waiting until I finish high school and then elope with him if he converts. I don't understand why I can't marry someone if he becomes Muslim. That is not haram. But I don't want to disappoint my parents.
I have asked all my friends fpr help, and they all don't know what I should do.. They feel very bad for me.. Please help.. I love him so much, and I want to be with him forever.. What should I do?
Thank you so much.
- Salaam- Emanne
Sister Noorah's Answer:
Bismillahi Rahmani Rahim
Salaam Alaikum wa Rahmatullah
I see that some of the comments have taken a soft line with you, but I cannot force myself to do so. You say "I know I'm not supposed to talk to boys" but then you went ahead and did it anyway. This relationship started in the haraam and only the haraam can come from it. You are not "in love". You are a child who is infatuated with a young man who does not believe in Allah and the Last Day. Trust me, love does NOT conquer all. By engaging in this forbidden relationship, you are committing many sins. You are committing zinah, yes, zinah of the tongue by talking to him, zinah of the eye by looking at him, zinah of touch even if you have not engaged in the ultimate zinah of fornication. I think you are looking for someone to tell you that it's okay to be "in love" and that everything will work out if you simply let him do a sham conversion to Islam and wow your parents. Well, I'm here to tell you that that is not the case.
Your duty now is to understand that what you are doing is wrong, wrong like a robber robbing a bank, wrong like a person drinking alcohol, wrong and even more serious than those crimes. You are robbing YOURSELF of goodness, of chastity, of Islam. You are harming yourself for an imaginary "love" to someone who has no religious commitment. What will you base a marriage on, if Allah forbid you were to run away with him or marry someone who only pretended to believe? Sex? Physical looks? These fade with time and if you don't have a strong committment to Allah then there will be no long-term success. By long-term, I speak not just of this world but of the world to come. Are you willing to spend an eternity in Hellfire for this man? If so, then do whatever you want. If not, you must cut off all contact with this man, and sincerely repent to Allah for the mistakes you have made. You should spend time learning about Islam, for if you truly knew your rights and responsibilities as a Muslim woman, you would never have made this mistake. Busy yourself with prayer and fasting. Stay away from places where there are a lot of single men. Make sure you are covered properly so that you do not attract the gaze of ment. Work on yourself so that you can become a better person and a better Muslimah and ultimately find a good strong Muslim husband who will complete half your deen. To do less than this is to sell yourself short and to lead yourself into more heartbreak and strife.
I'm sorry if I sound harsh, but I want you to wake up from your fairy tale. There will be no good outcome from this. Allah will not allow a good end to come from a haraam beginning, so you had best get on with your life without this young man in the picture. May Allah give him hedayah, too, for his own soul's sake, but that is a totally separate issue from his relationship with you.
Fi aman Allah,
Noorah

President Obama makes a direct link between economic growth and clean energy policies. 'Clean energy standard' pushed
President Barack Obama nudged lawmakers on Tuesday night to take another swing at several high-profile energy ideas, including phasing out of billions of dollars in oil subsidies, ramping up use of biofuels and electric vehicles and setting a nationwide goal for “clean energy sources” that includes nuclear and “clean coal.”
Obama suggested the White House will also continue to push efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions – although he didn't use the phrase climate change - and promote clean energy technologies despite the death of cap-and-trade legislation last year.
Story Continued Below
The president sought to make a direct link between economic growth and clean energy policies, while studiously avoiding picking favorites among several different power sources that can quickly prompt bitter regional fights, as well as partisan ones.
“Now, clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy jobs if businesses know there will be a market for what they're selling,” Obama said. “So tonight, I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal: by 2035, 80 percent of America's electricity will come from clean energy sources. Some folks want wind and solar. Others want nuclear, clean coal, and natural gas. To meet this goal, we will need them all – and I urge Democrats and Republicans to work together to make it happen.”
Prospects for a so-called “clean energy standard” are wide open in 2011 but it could be the most aggressive and politically-feasible way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on Capitol Hill in this Congress. Attention will be centered first around the Senate and competing bills expected from Sens. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and perhaps even Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.).
But across Capitol Hill, House Republicans have not been so keen to embrace new national energy mandates, even if it covers some of their favorites like coal and nuclear power.
“If the president wants to achieve it, he can achieve it in half of that time, the 2035, he can achieve the 80 percent with nuclear alone,” House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) told POLITICO.
For the third year in a row, Obama also waded into the heated debate over energy subsidies with a call for Congress to eliminate billions of dollars in oil benefits. Past efforts haven't gone so well. But the president Tuesday repeated his call for the cuts, while shuffling the money toward biofuels and other programs that can help reach a goal of 1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2015.
“I don't know if you've noticed, but they're doing just fine on their own,” Obama said of the oil companies, briefly stopping to crack a smile. “So instead of subsidizing yesterday's energy, let's invest in tomorrow's.”
Obama got only polite applause at mention of chopping out the oil subsidies. After the speech, he got panned on both sides of the aisle.
“I'm not sure raising the price of gasoline when the price of gasoline is gong up right now is something the American consumer wants,” House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings (R-Wash.) said in an interview. “That would be the net effect of that. But I don't think it's a good idea in general when the economy is trying to recover to increase taxes on any sector of the economy.”
Disruption is the new buzzword in the world of infotech, innovation and investment. Anybody with an idea that is extraordinarily brilliant and hence unsettling for what prevails as the stagnant norm is perceived as disrupting the status quo.
Sometimes it works to the benefit of both innovator and industry, but at times the disruption proves meaningless, causing loss and setting back progress.
We are witnessing something similar in our politics.
Finding themselves mired in the National Herald case, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi accused the PMO of a vendetta
The highest common denominator, the nation's wellbeing through economic growth, development and individual prosperity, has been supplanted by the lowest common denominator, cheap populism, opportunism and cynicism.
Disquiet
Disruptive politics may have been fashionable in the 1960s through the 1980s, but in retrospect it yielded nothing more than the fulfilment of personal agendas, ambitions and aggrandisement in the name of serving the nation and its people.
The nation remained stuck in a groove, the people mired in poverty. The world's largest democracy was also the world's biggest joke. Yet this harsh truth is lost on those who are now striving to revive the politics of disruption, in the guise of dissent and disquiet.
Two successive sessions of Parliament have been washed out, important legislation has been stalled, and meaningful debate on policy and programme scuttled by taking recourse to disruption. Retro could not have made a more dramatic comeback.
The massive mandate given by the people to PM Narendra Modi in 2014 has been virtually vetoed by a cussed Opposition. The belief that the formation of a government with a majority of its own for the first time in the last three decades would fetch decisive governance has been violated by abusing the infirmity of our parliamentary system.
Nothing illustrates this better than the fact that legislation passed in the Lok Sabha, where the Modi Sarkar has the numbers, has been blocked in the Rajya Sabha, where the Congress and its allies have the numbers.
The Upper House was conceived as the House of Elders where wisdom would prevail over partisan politics. It is now a chamber of naysayers. On one pretext or the other, the Congress has disrupted proceedings in the Rajya Sabha. Congress MPs wouldn't let the House function because of court summons to their supreme leader Sonia Gandhi and dynast Rahul in a criminal case involving alleged malfeasance in acquisition of National Herald properties. The established norm of not entering the Well of the House was disrupted.
Also disrupted was the honour that once attached to political fidelity. We saw scenes of sworn enemies joining hands with no other purpose than preventing what Parliament is funded by taxpayers to do: debate, deliberate and legislate.
That the CPI(M) would make common cause with the Trinamool Congress, and that both would join hands with the Congress, was unimaginable till it happened. Politics does make for strange bedfellows. Disruptionist politics makes for strangers abandoning common sense precautions for the momentary gratification fetched by a political orgy.
This is not about the Opposition performing its indisputably important role in a multi-party democracy. This is vetoing the choice of the masses because they rejected India's venal ruling classes. This is caste tyranny at play - an OBC may represent popular aspirations, but remains unacceptable in Lutyens' Delhi.
The Congress believed its manufactured narrative of victimhood by spinning the court summons to Sonia and Rahul as “political vendetta” would recreate the sympathy wave that rehabilitated Mrs Indira Gandhi during the post-Emergency Janata rule.
Sonia even invoked her mother-in-law's name (notably, not the name of her husband, who fought back charges in the Bofors scandal) and Rahul accused the PMO of vendetta.
Dynasty
But the glycerine tears of rage did not work. India today is different from India in 1977-80. Information flow has ensured that the masses are not easily misled. The Dynasty is despised as never before. The judiciary has long ceased to be ‘committed'. And, the incumbent government is not a gaggle of squabbling politicians chasing loaves and fishes of office.
Modi is neither Morarji Desai nor Charan Singh. Indeed, truth be told, he is neither AB Vajpayee nor LK Advani. There may or may not have been a scripted proverbial Plan B. But it happened nonetheless, further fuelling disruption and stalling legislation in the closing days of winter session.
The CBI's raid on premises linked to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's principal secretary Rajendra Kumar provided a new platform for launching a vicious attack on the government. Politics of disruption transmogrified into politics of brazen blackmail.
Slighted that his favourite bureaucrat should be investigated for graft, Kejriwal struck back with a volley of charges against Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, digging up allegations of corruption in DDCA that had already been looked into by the SFIO when the Congress was in power.
Jaitley has many detractors, but even his worst enemy would swear by his integrity and probity.
Downside
The Congress has latched on to those charges and DDCA has become the reason to disrupt the Rajya Sabha, snuffing out the flickering hope that the GST Bill, the Real Estate Bill, the Arbitration Bill, and other pending bills would be passed before Parliament adjourns.
Economic reforms that are crucial to keep the world interested in the India Story have been put off till another day.
Kejriwal setting up a cockamamie inquiry commission headed by a lawyer whose antipathy towards the government of the day is no secret; Ram Jethmalani, reviled and abused by the AAP till yesterday, now defending Kejriwal and his cronies in court; and finally a BJP backbencher MP, Kirti Azad, being beckoned by Sonia to disrupt proceedings in the Lok Sabha - all this makes for eyeball-grabbing headlines, TRP-driving primetime shows.
But what does it do to India? What does it do to the masses waiting in eager anticipation for delivery? And, what does it do to India's image in a world teeming with competitors for investment and technology and jobs?
Disruption has its downside. We are suffering that, as a nation, as a people.

Ghosts'n Goblins a.k.a. Makaimura (1985)

The adventures of Sir Arthur, the brave and noble knight of Demon World, have long since passed into legend and become known as some of the grandest in the world of Men. However, the latest in what is becoming an embarrassing series of confessions here at Red Parsley is that until very recently I'd never even played this, the original game in the series. Eeek! Time to rectify that I deem, and what better way than to try the original of the original! First though, it might be prudent to try honing my skills and reaction times, for even I already knew that Ghosts'n Goblins is a supremely difficult game, apparently one of the hardest ever, and that scares me. As much as I may like retro gaming, I've never been especially good at most types of games, so I find myself approaching this notoriously hardcore challenge with a great deal of caution. Gulp!
Despite my love of the Shinobi series and my mastery of some of its sequels, side-scrolling platform-shooters are one type of game I'm not especially skilled at. I am already familiar with the aforementioned knight though, having played his second game extensively on my treasured MegaDrive over the years, so I should be fairlyready for this, surely? Hmmm. Anyway, like that game, Sir Arthur's first quest consists of six mostly-multi-tiered stages, each teeming with predictably scary creatures. He can run and jump through them to his heart's content, provided the time-limit doesn't expire (which spells instant death), but his objective is only to reach the end and defeat the evil boss that dwells therein. At the end of the final stage Sir Arthur must battle Satan, King of the Demon World. If he manages to defeat him, he will not only restore balance to the world, but also get his hands on Satan's prisoner – the delightful Princess Prin Prin.
Killing the lesser enemies on each stage is not mandatory – some of them are actually infinite so it's not even possible. With this and the time-limit in mind, it's advisable to proceed to the end of each stage as quickly as possible. Sir Arthur is initially armed with throwable lances which are in unlimited supply and defeat most enemies, certainly on earlier stages, with one hit. A few of the enemies, however, carry urns. Killing them allows you to then collect the contents which is most often one of numerous sparkly items for bonus points (including some of the Princesses' possessions!), but occasionally you'll find a new weapon. These include Daggers (my favourite – narrow range but rapid fire), Flaming Torch (short range fiery things), Axe (wider range and powerful, but fires slowly), and one final secret weapon which is required to defeat Satan.
The only items you'll find already dotted about on the platforms are coins or money bags, again for bonus points, but putting any degree of emphasis on the collection of this stuff is not advised – the default weapon is fine for the whole game (except the final boss battle), and points, while nice, won't get you any further into the game! For that, practise is required, and lots of it. That brings me to that legendary difficulty… I've been playing Ghosts'n Goblins for a couple of weeks solid now and, while it's definitely a tough game, I wouldn't call it one of the hardest ever. After the reputation and build-up, I was expecting the most savagely torturous game in the universe, but for me it's just… very tough! The main problem with the actual stages comes from the infinite nature of some of the enemies. The first stage, for example, features zombies who rise out of the ground and amble toward you. These don't really cause a problem unless one emerges very close to you, and it's the same story with the other stages.
The second features small flying demons which this time come from some of the windows of the buildings that form the various backdrops. These things also appear without limit and again the main problem is when they appear very close to you, and there is an equivalent beastie through most parts of the game. For me though, the biggest problem in terms of difficulty was the larger enemies – specifically, the annoying Sons of Satan (red devil things – see screenshot below), as well as the even larger bosses which take the form of dragons and ogres and things of that nature, all of whom take numerous hits to put down. If you lose a life while attempting this you'll return to the half-way point of the stage so each guardian has to be defeated with a single life – no small ask when Sir Arthur can only take one hit without dying which removes his armour, forcing him to fight on in just his undies – one of gaming's most enduring images!
If Arthur does lose his armor more can be collected if you're very lucky, but a new suit isn't exactly forthcoming a vast majority of the time, and can never be collected during a boss fight which is another reason these confrontations are the part of the game I have most trouble with. If you can last long enough though, there's a lot to see here. The sprites are numerous and look superb for their day. Even more impressive are the backgrounds which change several times during the course of most stages and range from the graveyard in which you begin to a town, various towers, and gloomy caverns, on the way to Satan's castle itself.
As mentioned earlier, you need a specific weapon to fight the Dark Lord himself (a Crucifix in the Japanese version, a Shield in other versions) and if you don't have it you'll be sent back to the star of the fifth level.As well as looking nice, and highly varied for its time, the music and sound effects are also great and add a lot of charm to an already-distinctive game. Control of Sir Arthur is pretty good for most part, with two exceptions – after playing Ghouls'n Ghosts so much I assumed the controls would be the same here, but sadly this original doesn't offer the option of shooting directly upwards. I also found that he often got ‘stuck' at the tops or bottoms of ladders. Apart from this though, our hero is still pretty nippy and can run and leap his way out of most hairy situations in the right hands. There are a few unfair moments which will have you turning the air blue but generally I found Ghosts'n Goblins to be very tough but an addictive and highly enjoyable challenge all the same. It's taken me far too long to give it a proper try but I'm really glad I did now. A true classic indeed!

White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller took to the briefing room podium Wednesday afternoon to defend President Donald Trump's new support for an immigration system that would prioritize people who speak English.
While defending the system, Miller said it's already law that those seeking to become naturalized citizens must speak English.
“The Statue of Liberty says give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, it doesn't say anything about speaking English,” CNN reporter Jim Acosta said to Miller.
To which Miller responded, “Well, first of all, right now it's a requirement that, to be naturalized, you have to speak English,” Miller said.
However, that is not true.
Immigrants who meet certain qualifications can receive exemptions to take the civics test in their native language.
Those aged 50 or older who have had a green card for at least 20 years can receive such an exemption, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Those aged 55 or older who have been permanent residents for 15 years can also receive that exemption.
Those who have a “physical or developmental disability or mental impairment” may also be eligible for an exemption, according to the USCIS.
What's more, the naturalization test does not require applicants to speak English fluently in order to pass.
According to USCIS policy, “a naturalization applicant must only demonstrate an ability to read, write, speak and understand words in ordinary usage.”
That means applicants can have “noticeable errors in pronouncing, constructing, spelling and understanding completely certain words, phrases and sentences” and still pass.
“If the applicant generally understands and responds meaningfully to questions relevant to his or her naturalization eligibility, then he or she has sufficiently demonstrated the ability to speak English,” the USCIS rules state.

The signing of draft picks has been reduced to a formality, which is why most of them are already taken care of before teams take the six-week break before training camp.
In fact, only 20 unsigned picks from the 2017 NFL Draft remain, after yesterday's signings.
Eight of the unsigned picks are in the first round, including four of the top six. The list begins with Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky (second overall), followed by Solomon Thomas of the 49ers (third), Corey Davis of the Titans (fifth), Jamal Adams of the Jets (sixth), Patrick Mahomes of the Chiefs (10), Gareon Conley of the Raiders (24), Jabrill Peppers of the Browns (25), and Ryan Ramczyk of the Saints (32).
The only second-rounder left on the board is Obi Melifonwu of the Raiders (56).
Then comes six in the third-round: Dawuane Smoot of the Jaguars (68), Eddie Vanderdoes of the Raiders (88), D'Onta Foreman of the Texans (89), Jordan Lewis of the Cowboys (92), Montravius Adams of the Packers (93), and Kenny Golladay of the Lions (96).
After that, the final five unsigned picks are all Rams, including fourth-rounders Josh Reynolds (117) and Samson Ebukam (125), sixth-rounders Tanzel Smart (189) and Sam Rogers (206), and seventh-rounder Ejuan Price (234).
Considering 40 percent of the remaining guys play for two teams, it shouldn't be hard or take long for this list to dwindle quickly.
What comes to your mind first when you think of Indian Food? I'm sure that the first few things that come to your mind are about the rich spices, mouth watering curries, oily, fat, hot, fine aromas, rich flavors, diversity, butter chicken, tandoori chicken etc. But no-one would think anything close to Bizarre. For people who thought Indian food was all about vegetables, curries and spices, read on and your perceptions will be change. Mine did. For I thought that these bizarre food items were part of other south-east Asian countries but not India. I was actually surprised to see them as a part of Indian regional culinary delights. If you thought Indian food is irresistible, you need to think again.
Here is the list of 10 bizarre Indian foods

Worms Found in KFC's Fried Chicken

Recently there was a buzz about worms found in KFC's Fried Chicken. We thought of adding it to our list of “Bizarre or Exotic, Decide for Yourself”.
Rhinitis, also known as coryza,[3] is irritation and inflammation of the mucous membrane inside the nose. Common symptoms are a stuffy nose, runny nose, sneezing, and post-nasal drip.[4]
The inflammation is caused by viruses, bacteria, irritants or allergens. The most common kind of rhinitis is allergic rhinitis,[5] which is usually triggered by airborne allergens such as pollen and dander.[6] Allergic rhinitis may cause additional symptoms, such as sneezing and nasal itching, coughing, headache,[7] fatigue, malaise, and cognitive impairment.[8][9] The allergens may also affect the eyes, causing watery, reddened, or itchy eyes and puffiness around the eyes.[7] The inflammation results in the generation of large amounts of mucus, commonly producing a runny nose, as well as a stuffy nose and post-nasal drip. In the case of allergic rhinitis, the inflammation is caused by the degranulation of mast cells in the nose. When mast cells degranulate, they release histamine and other chemicals,[10] starting an inflammatory process that can cause symptoms outside the nose, such as fatigue and malaise.[11] In the case of infectious rhinitis, it may occasionally lead to pneumonia, either viral or bacterial. Sneezing also occurs in infectious rhinitis to expel bacteria and viruses from the respiratory tract.
Rhinitis is very common. Allergic rhinitis is more common in some countries than others; in the United States, about 10%–30% of adults are affected annually.[12] Mixed rhinitis (MR) refers to patients with nonallergic rhinitis and allergic rhinitis. MR is a specific rhinitis subtype. It may represent between 50 and 70% of all AR patients. However, true prevalence of MR has not been confirmed yet.[13]
Types [ edit ]
Rhinitis is categorized into three types (although infectious rhinitis is typically regarded as a separate clinical entity due to its transient nature): (i) infectious rhinitis includes acute and chronic bacterial infections; (ii) nonallergic (vasomotor) rhinitis includes idiopathic, hormonal, atrophic, occupational, and gustatory rhinitis, as well as rhinitis medicamentosa (drug-induced); (iii) allergic rhinitis, triggered by pollen, mold, animal dander, dust, Balsam of Peru, and other inhaled allergens.[5]
Infectious [ edit ]
Rhinitis is commonly caused by a viral or bacterial infection, including the common cold, which is caused by Rhinoviruses, Coronaviruses, and influenza viruses, others caused by adenoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, metapneumovirus, and measles virus, or bacterial sinusitis, which is commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Symptoms of the common cold include rhinorrhea, sneezing, sore throat (pharyngitis), cough, congestion, and slight headache.[14][citation needed]
Nonallergic rhinitis [ edit ]
Nonallergic rhinitis refers to rhinitis that is not due to an allergy. The category was formerly referred to as vasomotor rhinitis, as the first cause discovered was vasodilation due to an overactive parasympathetic nerve response. As additional causes were identified, additional types of nonallergic rhinitis were recognized. Vasomotor rhinitis is now included among these under the more general classification of nonallergic rhinitis.[15] The diagnosis is made upon excluding allergic causes.[16] It is an umbrella term of rhinitis of multiple causes, such as occupational (chemical), smoking, gustatory, hormonal, senile (rhinitis of the elderly), atrophic, medication-induced (including rhinitis medicamentosa), local allergic rhinitis, non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome (NARES) and idiopathic (vasomotor or non-allergic, non-infectious perennial allergic rhinitis (NANIPER), or non-infectious non-allergic rhinitis (NINAR).[17]
In vasomotor rhinitis,[18][19] certain nonspecific stimuli, including changes in environment (temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, or weather), airborne irritants (odors, fumes), dietary factors (spicy food, alcohol), sexual arousal, exercise,[20] and emotional factors trigger rhinitis.[21] There is still much to be learned about this, but it is thought that these non-allergic triggers cause dilation of the blood vessels in the lining of the nose, which results in swelling and drainage.
Non-allergic rhinitis can co-exist with allergic rhinitis, and is referred to as "mixed rhinitis".[22] The pathology of vasomotor rhinitis appears to involve neurogenic inflammation[23] and is as yet not very well understood. The role of transient receptor potential ion channels on the non-neuronal nasal epithelial cells has also been suggested. Overexpression of these receptors have influence the nasal airway hyper-responsiveness to non-allergic irritant environmental stimuli (e.g., extremes of temperature, changes in osmotic or barometric pressure).[24] Vasomotor rhinitis appears to be significantly more common in women than men, leading some researchers to believe that hormone imbalance plays a role.[25][26] In general, age of onset occurs after 20 years of age, in contrast to allergic rhinitis which can be developed at any age. Individuals with vasomotor rhinitis typically experience symptoms year-round, though symptoms may be exacerbated in the spring and autumn when rapid weather changes are more common.[15] An estimated 17 million United States citizens have vasomotor rhinitis.[citation needed]
Drinking alcohol may cause rhinitis as well as worsen asthma (see alcohol-induced respiratory reactions). In certain populations, particularly those of East Asian countries such as Japan, these reactions have a nonallergic basis.[27] In other populations, particularly those of European descent, a genetic variant in the gene that metabolizes ethanol to acetaldehyde, ADH1B, is associated with alcohol-induced rhinitis. It is suggested that this variant metabolizes ethanol to acetaldehyde too quickly for further processing by ALDH2 and thereby leads to the accumulation of acetaldehyde and rhinitis symptoms.[28] In these cases, alcohol-induced rhinitis may be of the mixed rhinitis type and, it seems likely, most cases of alcohol-induced rhinitis in non-Asian populations reflect true allergic response to the non-ethanol and/or contaminants in alcoholic beverages, particularly when these beverages are wines or beers.[27] Alcohol-exacerbated rhinitis is more frequent in individuals with a history of rhinitis exacerbated by aspirin.[29]
Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), particularly those that inhibit cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1), can worsen rhinitis and asthma symptoms in individuals with a history of either one of these diseases.[30] These exacerbations most often appear due to NSAID hypersensitivity reactions rather than NSAID-induced allergic reactions.[31]
The antihistamine azelastine, applied as a nasal spray, may be effective for vasomotor rhinitis.[32] Fluticasone propionate or budesonide (both are steroids) in nostril spray form may also be used for symptomatic treatment. The antihistamine cyproheptadine is also effective, probably due to its antiserotonergic effects.
A systematic review on non-allergic rhinitis reports improvement of overall function after treatment with capsaicin (the active component of chili peppers). The quality of evidence is low, however.[33]
Allergic [ edit ]
Allergic rhinitis or hay fever may follow when an allergen such as pollen, dust, or Balsam of Peru[34] is inhaled by an individual with a sensitized immune system, triggering antibody production. These antibodies mostly bind to mast cells, which contain histamine. When the mast cells are stimulated by an allergen, histamine (and other chemicals) are released. This causes itching, swelling, and mucus production.
Symptoms vary in severity between individuals. Very sensitive individuals can experience hives or other rashes. Particulate matter in polluted air and chemicals such as chlorine and detergents, which can normally be tolerated, can greatly aggravate the condition.[citation needed]
Characteristic physical findings in individuals who have allergic rhinitis include conjunctival swelling and erythema, eyelid swelling, lower eyelid venous stasis, lateral crease on the nose, swollen nasal turbinates, and middle ear effusion.[35]
Even if a person has negative skin-prick, intradermal and blood tests for allergies, they may still have allergic rhinitis, from a local allergy in the nose. This is called local allergic rhinitis.[36] Many people who were previously diagnosed with nonallergic rhinitis may actually have local allergic rhinitis.[37]
A patch test may be used to determine if a particular substance is causing the rhinitis.
Rhinitis medicamentosa [ edit ]
Rhinitis medicamentosa is a form of drug-induced nonallergic rhinitis which is associated with nasal congestion brought on by the use of certain oral medications (primarily sympathomimetic amine and 2-imidazoline derivatives) and topical decongestants (e.g., oxymetazoline, phenylephrine, xylometazoline, and naphazoline nasal sprays) that constrict the blood vessels in the lining of the nose.[38]
Chronic atrophic rhinitis [ edit ]
Chronic rhinitis is a form of atrophy of the mucous membrane and glands of the nose.
Rhinitis sicca [ edit ]
Chronic form of dryness of the mucous membranes.
Polypous rhinitis [ edit ]
Chronic rhinitis associated with polyps in the nasal cavity.
Pathophysiology [ edit ]
Pathological changes in non-allergic rhinitis[24]
[24] Mechanism of non-allergic rhinitis: Imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic components in the nasal mucous membrane
Most prominent pathological changes observed are nasal airway epithelial metaplasia in which goblet cells replace ciliated columnar epithelial cells in the nasal mucous membrane.[24] This results in mucin hypersecretion by goblet cells and decreased mucociliary activity. Nasal secretion are not adequately cleared with clinical manifestation of nasal congestion, sinus pressure, post-nasal dripping, and headache. Over-expression of transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels, such as TRPA1 and TRPV1, may be involved in the pathogenesis of non-allergic rhinitis.[39]
Association between rhinitis and asthma [ edit ]
Neurogenic inflammation produced by neuropeptides released from sensory nerve endings to the airways is a proposed common mechanism of association between both allergic and non-allergic rhinitis with asthma. This may explain higher association of rhinitis with asthma developing later in life.[40] Environmental irritants acts as modulators of airway inflammation in these contiguous airways. Development of occupational asthma is often preceded by occupational rhinitis. Among the causative agents are flours, enzymes used in processing food, latex, isocyanates, welding fumes, epoxy resins, and formaldehyde. Accordingly, prognosis of occupational asthma is contingent on early diagnosis and the adoption of protective measures for rhinitis.[41]
Diagnosis [ edit ]
Prevention [ edit ]
In the case of infectious rhinitis, vaccination against influenza viruses, adenoviruses, measles, rubella, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, diphtheria, Bacillus anthracis, and Bordetella pertussis may help prevent it.
Management [ edit ]
The management of rhinitis depends on the underlying cause.
For allergic rhinitis, intranasal corticosteroids are recommended.[42] For severe symptoms intranasal antihistamines may be added.[42]
Pronunciation and etymology [ edit ]
Rhinitis is pronounced ,[43] while coryza is pronounced .[44]
Rhinitis comes from the Ancient Greek ῥίς rhis, gen.: ῥινός rhinos "nose". Coryza has a dubious etymology. Robert Beekes rejected an Indo-European derivation and suggested a Pre-Greek reconstruction *karutya.[45] According to physician Andrew Wylie, "we use the term [coryza] for a cold in the head, but the two are really synonymous. The ancient Romans advised their patients to clean their nostrils and thereby sharpen their wits."[46]

December is upon us and that means plentiful opportunities to watch the enduring classic, It's a Wonderful Life. Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of viewers completely misinterpret Frank Capra's dystopian nightmare as a heartwarming Christmas tale.
The emotional appeal of angels getting their wings is undeniable. Crying out for correction, however, are the vicious slanders regarding the film's real hero, Henry Potter.
We first hear of Potter from George Bailey's father, Peter Bailey, who badmouths Potter with the usual falsehoods about businessmen. But during Bailey's envious rant, we learn something important: Henry Potter is a board member of the building and loan. We later learn Potter is, in fact, a stockholder.
That puts a somewhat different light on his subsequent motion to liquidate the business upon Peter Bailey's death. Yes, we hear George Bailey repeating the familiar socialist tropes his father did: that Potter only wants to close the building and loan because he “can't get his hands on it” and considers the little people cattle, etc.
But Potter responds with some rather inconvenient facts: the building and loan has been making bad business decisions, providing what we'd now call subprime loans to people who can't pay them back.
Potter the Stockholder
The Baileys squander their investors' money on a do-gooder, subprime loan scheme to make everyone a homeowner.We don't know how Potter became a stockholder, but the Bailey Building and Loan does not appear to be a publicly traded company. The most likely explanation is Peter Bailey asked Potter for capital, just as George Bailey does later in the film, in between rounds of disparaging Potter as a greedy capitalist. That would be perfectly consistent with today's “progressives,” who rail against capitalists out of one side of their mouths while sucking up to them for money out of the other.
But regardless of how Potter became a stockholder, Peter Bailey has a fiduciary duty to him to run the business for maximum profit, providing Potter and the other stockholders a return on their investments, something George Bailey confirms they never intended to do. Instead, the Baileys squander their investors' money on a do-gooder, subprime loan scheme to make everyone a homeowner. It worked out in fictional Bedford Falls about as well as it did in early 2000s America.
Meanwhile, the Baileys constantly slander Potter's rental houses as “overpriced slums.” These are the same Baileys whose housing opportunities are more expensive than Potter's.
But People Like Potter's Houses
Their accusations constantly beg the question: If Potter's houses are so bad, why do so many people choose to live in them? It's constantly implied Potter's customers have no other choice, but what exactly does that mean? Why has no one else, including any of the businessmen on the board of the Bailey Building and Loan, developed rental properties that are higher in quality, lower in price, or both?
The inescapable truth is Potter is wealthy because he provides a product that most satisfies his customers' preferences for quality and price. If there were an opportunity to provide a higher quality product at a lower price than Potter was charging, a competitor would do so and take market share away from Potter, until Potter either raised his quality, lowered his price, or both.
The Baileys burn with resentment that so many residents of Bedford Falls prudently choose to live in Potter's less expensive housing than buy a house they can't afford, financed by the Baileys' Ponzi scheme. Thus, even after shirking their fiduciary duty to run the business properly, the Baileys spend decades assaulting Potter's character in a transparent attempt to lure away his customers.
Potter the Rescuer
Without Potter, a large portion of Bedford Falls would be unemployed.When the Depression hits and the Bailey Building and Loan is exposed for the fractional reserve fraud it is, Potter offers to come to the rescue with a generous offer to buy out its customers. It is noteworthy there is a run on the Bailey Building and Loan and the local bank, but Potter is financially secure enough to save them both, proving once again he is the only honorable businessman in the film.
But we must give the devil his due. George Bailey, the ultimate huckster, saves the building and loan without Potter's help, convincing the yokel mob making a run on his business to keep their money tied up in his fundamentally insolvent confidence game.
That brings us to the one regrettable act Potter is guilty of, which is concealing the $8,000.00 the incompetent Billy Bailey inadvertently handed him while attempting to make a deposit. It's true this was an underhanded act, although not unprovoked.
We don't know how much Potter had invested in the Building and Loan to become a stockholder, but suspect it was a lot more than $8,000. One could make the case he was merely getting back some of the money the Baileys had previously defrauded him of, but there are courts for such matters and Potter should have sought their help if he had a case.
Smearing Potter
Nevertheless, two generations of Baileys had led a decades-long assault on Potter's good name, resulting in most townspeople disliking him, even though he has quite literally saved their lives on numerous occasions. Without him, a large portion of Bedford Falls would be unemployed, have nowhere to live, or both. It is not an exaggeration to say that without Henry Potter, Bedford Falls would cease to exist. Yet, thanks to the Baileys, he is the most hated man in town.
Compare Potter's vindictive reaction when George Bailey crawls to him for help after the $8,000.00 is lost to Potter's reaction at the board meeting at the beginning of the movie. At the board meeting, Potter dismisses George's unhinged attack upon him and redirects the discussion to the subject of the meeting: what is best for Bedford Falls. By the latter confrontation, Potter tries to have George arrested for embezzling.
Potter's dastardly act is totally out of character with the Potter of the earlier scene or any other event we know of in Potter's life. As far as we know, he has always been a hard-nosed, unsentimental businessman, but has never committed a crime or held a grudge, as he does now. Everything we know about Potter up to this point tells us his vindictive attempt to have George Bailey prosecuted is precisely the kind of emotional decision-making Potter has avoided for most of his life. That is why he is so wealthy at the beginning of the film.
Potter's Breaking Point
Everyone has a breaking point. Potter had evidently reached his. Had he been prosecuted for keeping the $8,000.00, which may have been tricky from a legal standpoint, given that Billy Bailey had handed the money to him, he could easily have pleaded temporary insanity caused by years of psychological warfare waged against him by the Baileys.
We'll never know, because before Potter has any opportunity to allow his passion to cool and clear up the misunderstanding, George Bailey sets off on his suicide melodrama, followed by a long, self-aggrandizing hallucination about angels and how Bedford Falls would be worse without him. By the time he concludes his childish escape from reality, the same yokels he previously conned during the Depression are now bailing him out once again, foreshadowing so many future bailouts of dishonest financiers whose assets should have been turned over to better management in bankruptcy court.
The Triumph of Evil
In one of the darkest moments of the film, George Bailey's Christmas tree is jostled and one of the bells adorning it rings. George Bailey, now confident he and his fraudulent real estate scheme are safe, suggests the bell signifies an angel has earned his wings, as if his dishonest business dealings and ruthless defamation of legitimate competitors had divine sanction.
Nothing more is heard of Henry Potter, the man without whom Bedford Falls would not exist. He is left friendless and without the one thing he could cling to before George Bailey, the Devil incarnate, wrested it from his grasp: his honor. As the credits roll, evil has triumphed. The economic fallacies inherent in Baileyism become accepted truth, resulting in disaster after disaster, including the most recent in 2008.
Bart is under growing pressure to beef up security on the heels of a crime surge that includes mob attacks, sex assaults and robberies. To make matters worse, the number of people applying to join the BART police force is near an all-time low. Jodi Hernandez reports. (Published Tuesday, July 18, 2017)
BART Police Chief Says Rapes Have Increased, But May Not Be Connected
BART is under growing pressure to beef up security on the heels of a crime surge that includes mob attacks, sex assaults and robberies. To make matters worse, the number of people applying to join the BART police force is near an all-time low.
The agency's board of directors on Tuesday wrestled with safety concerns just hours after yet another violent attack.
A passenger at San Leandro's Bay Fair Station late Monday was assaulted by three or four men who punched and kicked him and also snatched his iPhone and laptop, according to BART. The victim was transported to a hospital for treatment of facial cuts and swelling, and the suspects managed to get away.
New numbers from BART indicate that there has recently been a 41 percent increase in violent crimes this year. The troubling trend was highlighted by an April mob attack during which dozens of youth stormed a train at Oakland's Coliseum Station to rob passengers.
Rusty Stapp and his family were aboard the train during the attack three months ago.
"I think it's sad, it's scary and I think if we don't all stand up and start making a change, it's just going to get worse," he said at the meeting Tuesday.
Stapp urged the agency's Board of Directors to take crime seriously and release surveillance video of attacks to the public.
"You have a disease going on right now and you either get out and start preventing the disease or the disease is going to proliferate," he said.
BART police Chief Carlos Rojas said Tuesday that an increase in rapes and other sexual crimes on the transit system so far this year is troubling but shouldn't be blown out of proportion.
Rojas said FBI statistics show that there were seven rapes reported on BART property from January through the end of June, compared to four in 2016, three in 2015 and two in 2014.
He said there has also been an increase in the number of reported sexual assaults, with 28 in the first six months of the year, which is the same number of sexual assaults reported during all of 2016, which was already up 75 percent from 2015 when only 16 sexual assault cases were reported.
Rojas said that although all of the reported rapes involved sexual violence, not all involved forced sexual intercourse, which is the traditional definition of rape.
Under federal crime reporting standards, sexual assaults with the intent to commit rape are reported as rapes, he said.
"One rape or sexual assault is too many," Rojas said.
He noted there's no indication that the crimes, most of which occurred at East Bay stations, are connected and said arrests have been made in some but not all of the rape cases.
BART Responds to Safety Concerns Following Uptick in Crime
BART's board of directors on Tuesday will wrestle with safety concerns just hours after yet another violent attack occurred in the transportation agency's network. Pete Suratos reports. (Published Tuesday, July 18, 2017)
A report that Rojas presented to BART's Operations, Safety and Workforce Committee today indicates that at a time when concerns are growing about crime at the transit system, BART is having a hard time recruiting and retaining enough police officers.
That said, the chief said he is working on recruitment and other strategies to make BART safer.
"We do cover four counties so it's an expansive system, but nevertheless crime is up and (we're) looking at ways to mitigate that and hopefully eliminate it," Rojas said.
Director Debora Allen, who represents Walnut Creek and surrounding cities in Contra Costa County, said after the meeting that 40 of the police officer positions that BART has budgeted for are unfilled.
"We should have more officers" because the transit system opened the new Warm Springs station in Fremont earlier this year and plans to open other new stations in the near future, Allen said.
"Not only do we have 40 vacant positions that are already budgeted for," she continued, but BART "should have a lot more police officers than we have budgeted for."
Speaking about a related topic, Allen said she's glad that BART will resume sending out daily reports for felony crimes and will issue monthly crime reports to BART directors.
Rojas, who became chief on May 25, discontinued the daily logs in early June, opting instead to send crime data to the free online tool CrimeMapping.com to inform riders about safety threats at or near BART stations.
"We have to have facts in order to identify the (crime) problem and to identify solutions," Allen said.
A few weeks ago I was recording Forerunner Glyphs in the Halo Series for Halopedia. And noticed a variant that kept popping up in Halo CEA, Halo 4, and also once in Halo 5.That variant is this.Now one could of thought these glyphs are random. I originally thought so. Regardless I stilll recorded all the glyphs I could find.Thoughout my studies I noticed there were 26 symbols used throughout Halo CEA, Halo 4, and Halo 5. Still with the mind set they were random.Till I saw the Eld in Halo 4 close up.Now this Eld has these symbols spiraling around. And if you put the symbols into lines. You may notice a pattern if you pair it with Cortanas translation."Guardianship for all living things lies with those whose evolution is most complete. The Mantle of Responsibility shelters all."The symbols actually make that.(I was kinda surprised when I saw that it actually translated perfectly)This logically gives us a lot of the Alphabet.Now if we look at this.We realize they arnt really co-ordinates. But more am alphabet. Though sadly in this IJKL arnt in this no matter how much you maneuver the cutscene. We already have "I" and "L" from the Eld though. Leading JK still missing.Now how do we get JK. Well K appears in a word in a very hard to translate place. A Spartan Ops cutscene.Now while hard to see. The word link does appear in it.Now because we have 25 letters translated we can very easily assume what J is.Now this is what the full alphabet looks like.You can use this fully there as that is a record of most patterns used thoughout Halo games.This was a fun lil thing to work out :) Hope you all enjoy playing with this new discovery.
GOP seeks to gut public campaign funding in Conn.

With a glut of politicians seeking public financing in the governor's race but Connecticut mired in a $2 billion budget hole, the future of the state's clean-elections program is in doubt.
Even at the height of its popularity — and cost.
More than $40 million is expected to be disbursed to statewide office and legislative candidates in 2018, based on Republican budget projections.
That would shatter the record of $33.4 million handed out in 2014, including $15.8 million spent in the governor's race.
For the first time in the history of the decade-old Citizens' Election Program, GOP lawmakers say, it does not have enough money to sustain itself. Until now, it has relied on proceeds from the sale of abandoned property and unclaimed bottle deposits to cover the cost of the grants.
Republicans are calling for the program to be gutted for next year, which could turn the entire campaign financing system upside-down during a pivotal election cycle.
“We do not have the funds available to be spending on bumper stickers and buttons,” said state Sen. L. Scott Frantz, R-Greenwich, a longtime critic of the program who is co-chairman of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee.
The state Elections Enforcement Commission, the nonpartisan agency in charge of the program, disputed the GOP's math. Commission officials said they did not have estimates for 2018 and declined to comment further.
Pay to play
Jolted by a pay-to-play scandal that led to the resignation and imprisonment of Gov. John G. Rowland a decade ago, the state created the program to wean candidates off special-interest money and free them from the time required for fundraising. Qualifying candidates must raise $5,000 to $250,000 — depending on the office they are seeking — in $100 increments or less.
Government watchdogs say the program is a national model that should be spared, with some embracing a bill to raise bottle deposits from 5 to 10 cents.
“Everyone is benefiting from the opportunity to go out and meet with their constituents and not have to worry about taking money from restricted sources like state contractors,” said Cheri Quickmire, executive director of Common Cause Connecticut. “I'm disappointed that every time there's a budget shortfall, they go looking at the Citizens' Election Fund. ... It's not enough money to make a difference.”
While Frantz has never accepted public campaign financing, a growing number of his GOP colleagues have since the program's inception. Nowhere is that about-face more evident than in the governor's race.
After spending $11 million of his own money in a narrow defeat in 2010, Republican businessman Tom Foley accepted $7.9 million in public funds for the 2014 primary and general election.
Then there's Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton, who voted against the program's creation when he was in the Legislature and is making his third attempt to qualify for public financing for governor.
“Philosophically, I never have agreed with public financing of political campaigns, but it's here to stay and the rules we're operating under right now,” Boughton said.
Boughton has raised about $100,000 toward the $250,000 qualifying threshold in the governor's race, which would make him eligible for a $1.4 million primary grant and $6.5 million for the general election if he wins the nomination. If funding is cut, Boughton said, the rules on who can contribute need to be reworked.
“It'll be impossible to raise any money,” Boughton said. “I'm not saying we go back to the days of the state contractors.”
Democratic State Comptroller Kevin Lembo, who is exploring a run for governor, defended the program.
“Connecticut's public financing helps level the political playing field and allows new people and more people to run for office,” Lembo said.
GOP leaders in the House and Senate support defunding the program, saying limited resources are needed elsewhere.
“At this point, taxpayer-funded elections isn't where it should be going,” said House Minority Leader Themis Klarides, R-Derby.
Senate Republican Leader Len Fasano, R-North Haven, said the program is becoming insolvent, but he is open to a hybrid funding mechanism.
“If we keep the CEP grants, we're going to have to add $10 million to the pot,” Fasano said.
Senate President Pro Tem Martin Looney, D-New Haven, said the Republicans' efforts to gut the program and their refusal to back legislation curbing independent political expenditures undermines the progress made under the program.
We've heard rumours about a next-gen version of Valve's Source Engine being in development, some of which even came from code inside Source Filmmaker. But Gabe Newell has finally gone on the record (see for yourself below at 6:14) to state that Source 2 is in the works, it is a brand-new engine and it's only waiting for a game to release it with.
Naturally, our excitable minds immediately leap to the conclusion that it will be used on Half-Life 3 and that Valve isn't ready to announce that game yet. Especially as the original Source was made for Half-Life 2. But then, we keep expecting Half-Life 3 at every major gaming event and it just never shows up.
The original Source Engine runs everything from Half-Life 2 and Portal to Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead. It was designed to be incrementally upgraded, which is why it's powered top-end games for so long. But the base code is getting old, so the existence of a brand new, next-gen version is definitely worth getting excited about. More as soon as we have it.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin called on the "power of prayer" to help combat Louisville's rising murder rate as he urged people to form prayer groups to walk high-crime neighborhoods.
His plan, outlined at a community meeting, was met with a mix of support and derision. Bevin urged volunteers to form teams of 3-10 people that pick the same block to walk at the same time of day, at least two or three times a week. He urged participants to make a yearlong commitment.
"Go around the block, pause on each corner, pray for the people there, move to the next corner," Bevin said later in describing his plan to reporters at a city park. "And over the course of the year, here's what's going to happen - they're going to get to know the people on the block."
Bevin, a socially conservative Republican, said it's a chance for "people of faith to put their faith to work." He hopes residents from the neighborhoods walk with people living elsewhere.
"Pretty unsophisticated. Pretty uncomplicated. Pretty basic," Bevin said. "But I truly believe we're going to see a difference in our city. I personally believe in the power of prayer."
Louisville Metro Police investigated a record 118 criminal homicides last year, but this year's murder rate - at 52 through May - was on pace to surpass last year's total.
America's youngest victims of gun violence
Skeptics of Bevin's roving prayer group plan included Micheshia Norment, the mother of a 7-year-old boy killed by a stray bullet last month. Her son, Dequante Hobbs Jr., was eating a bedtime snack at his kitchen table when the bullet smashed through a window and struck him in the head.
Norment, who attended the community meeting, said later that Bevin's "heart is in the right place," but predicted many people would be fearful to walk neighborhoods plagued by crime.
She also doubted it will be much of a deterrent for those prone to violence.
"They can do walk all day long but it doesn't mean it's going to change anything," she said.
Bevin took to Facebook to condemn the boy's death, and he paid his respects to the family by meeting with Norment at her son's visitation, a day before his burial.
Asked Thursday if she would join a prayer group, she replied: "I'm trying to get out of the neighborhood that I'm in because I've still got another child."
What would help curb violence, she said, is to make it harder to get guns.
Earlier in the week, Bevin downplayed the availability of guns as a problem behind Louisville's murder rate. He called the homicide spree a cultural, spiritual and economic problem.
"If you honestly believe it's a gun problem, then you're missing the point," he said.

A ministerial group from some Louisville neighborhoods the hardest hit by the violence offered its own plan to combat the crime wave. The preachers called for updating what they see as lax gun laws that make it "easier to buy a gun in West Louisville than a piece of fresh fruit."

Bevin said the rising murder rate requires law enforcement and economic solutions. He urged state and local policymakers to continue working on plans that would cost money. But he added: "There is no amount of money from any source that's going to fix this problem," he said.
Christopher 2X, an anti-violence activist, said, "How can it hurt to suggest that people want to participate in an exercise of spirit building within their block to try to encourage people toward positive thoughts."
Community activist Meshorn T. Daniels said Bevin's prayer group plan was "a good starting step" to get people involved. He agreed that relying only on money wouldn't curb violence.
"Let's fix the situation," he said. "Get people thinking differently. Change their heart, and then when you put your money in it, then the money is doing something."
LAUREL, Md., Jan. 10 (UPI) -- Researchers in Maryland say they've built an inexpensive sensor that can warn of impending catastrophic failure in lithium-ion batteries.
The batteries power millions of consumer electronic devices and are the most common type of battery used in hybrid and electric vehicles, but safety concerns have been raised by reports of battery malfunctions and fires in vehicles, mobile phones and laptop computers.
Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory say their sensor is based on a discovery of an intrinsic relationship between the internal temperature of lithium-ion cells and an easily measured electrical parameter of the cell.
Failures in lithium-ion batteries are typically caused by thermal runaway, a self-perpetuating condition that can occur once a cell reaches a critical temperature.
"An abnormally high internal cell temperature is a nearly universal manifestation of something going awry with the cell," researcher Rengaswamy Srinivasan said in a Johns Hopkins release Tuesday.
"These changes can occur within seconds, leading to a potentially catastrophic event if corrective measures are not taken immediately," he said. "When things start to go wrong inside the cell, time is not on your side.
"We discovered that we can measure the temperature of the protective layers between the electrodes and the electrolyte of the battery during normal operation," Srinivasan said. "These layers are where the conditions that lead to thermal runaway and catastrophic cell failure begin."
The sensor requires a simple electrical connection at the positive and negative terminals of the cell and can operate using power from the battery it is monitoring, researches said.
Five years ago, Ireland's government guaranteed almost all of the debts of six privately-owned banks. The subsequent bailout of these banks has cost the Irish public over €60 billion with about half of this due to the now-notorious Anglo Irish Bank.
One might have hoped that those who took the guarantee decision would now express regret. However, politicians from Fianna Fail and the Green Party, the parties then in government, still defend the decision. In continuing this defense, these politicians will undoubtedly now cite the recent article in the Irish Times by former IMF economist Donal Donovan, which claims that the guarantee was the “least bad” (in other words “best”) option available to the government.
Economics can be a tricky business and sometimes the true merits of policies run counter to peoples' gut feelings. However, if you had thought that a decision to guarantee almost every euro owed by the Irish banks was a reckless one that maximised the subsequent cost to the public, it turns out you're absolutely right and in this case the contrarian economist is wrong. Donovan's arguments in favour of the particular guarantee offered by the Irish government ignore widely-understood best practice in crisis management and are based on a flawed understanding of legal issues.
Ireland's banks were in crisis in September 2008 and there were strong arguments for some form of government intervention to preserve financial stability. Indeed, in the months after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, most European governments offered guarantees of various forms to their banks.
However, with the exception of Denmark, these governments offered guarantees that were far more limited in form than the Irish one. Specifically, schemes were put in place in the UK, Germany, France, Italy and elsewhere that guaranteed only new bond issues. (See this ECB report for a detailed description). This approach dealt with the problem at hand (banks having difficulties in getting funding) without making the public responsible for the full stock of debt that had been accumulated by their banks.
Most likely, other European governments were aware of the dangers of blanket guarantees. Research from the World Bank and the IMF had repeatedly demonstrated that guarantees of this type resulted in a substantial increase in the costs of banking crises.
While the “new debt only” approach to guarantees was adopted throughout the rest of Europe, it is dismissed out of hand by Donal Donovan who argues that the need to provide guarantees for new funding when existing debt subsequently fell due would have led to the government guaranteeing the same amount of money. This ignores the reality that the Irish banks had plenty of “locked-in” long-term funding that could not have be pulled at short notice. For example, as of September 2008, Anglo had €38 billion in liabilities with maturity over three months (see its annual report).
Even after passing the guarantee, the Irish government knew within three months that Anglo was a rogue institution. So a “new funding only” guarantee would have allowed the government to apply well-understood resolution tools for closing Anglo. Retail deposits (which accounted for less than twenty percent of Anglo's liabilities) could have been moved on to a new institution and the remaining “bad bank” could have been put into liquidation with unguaranteed creditors taking losses on their investments.
Those who argue that such a resolution would not have been possible should remember that both events have now occurred. Anglo's deposits were moved to AIB in 2011 and the rest of the bank was put into liquidation this year. Unfortunately, these actions were taken long after public money had been used to fill almost all the hole in Anglo's balance sheet. I don't wish to argue that an earlier application of these resolution tools would have been costless for the Irish public but they would have substantially reduced the burden on the public while maintaining financial stability.
Donovan's article repeats an argument often rolled out by the last government to defend the form of the guarantee, which is that Irish law would not have allowed for a selective guarantee that covered some liabilities but not senior bonds.
This argument is based on a flawed understanding of debt contracts and the legal basis for guarantees. Contractual clauses for senior bonds that state that they rank equally with other liabilities are only operable in a liquidation. Independent of the outcome of any liquidation, governments are free to provide additional insurance to whichever creditors they choose. If Donovan's argument was correct, then deposit insurance would be illegal because governments could not single out this class of creditors for special protection. In reality, no such prohibition exists.
The fact that the ECB used their influence in 2010 to convince the Irish government to continue repaying unguaranteed debt is cited by Donovan as a further argument that the blanket guarantee was unavoidable. However, these discussions took place after the Irish government had taken on all of Anglo's debts which over time became debts to the ECB. This gave the ECB enormous power over the Irish government in 2010. A limited guarantee in 2008 followed by a quick resolution and liquidation of Anglo would have kept the Irish government out of this precarious situation in the first place.
The final excuse offered for the blanket guarantee – that the government believed the banks had a liquidity problem but not a solvency problem – also lacks merit.
A liquidity problem did not require the guaranteeing of locked-in debts and, in any case, the evidence that the banks were heading towards a serious solvency problem was all around us by September 2008. Brian Lenihan had already admitted the construction sector had come to a shuddering halt and warnings from economists and journalists such as Morgan Kelly, Alan Ahearne and Richard Curran should have given pause for thought before placing the debts of the banks on the public's shoulders.
People are perhaps understandably tired at this point of again debating the merits of what happened five years ago. However, the additional debt piled on the public by the guarantee will make a big difference to ordinary Irish people's lives in the coming years, forcing more fiscal adjustment than would be necessary if there was a lower level of debt. And Ireland's issues with problem banks are not necessarily a thing of the past. A country that won't learn from its mistakes will be condemned to make them again.
Fianna Fail may well be back in government in Ireland in a couple of years and their continued defence of the blanket guarantee policy increases the chances that such a guarantee could be put in place again. Donal Donovan's arguments, however well-meant they may be, do not provide reasonable justification for an approach to banking problems that is unsound, unfair and unnecessarily expensive for the public.
MONTREAL — SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. is poised to unload its stake in a Canadian toll road, a sale that would raise as much as $3 billion as the company returns to its roots in construction and engineering. Chief Executive Officer Robert Card has said SNC is taking a harder look at its minority stake in 407 International Inc., the operator of a toll road in the Toronto area.

“I expect them to sell their 407 stake this year,” said Denis Durand, a senior partner at Montreal-based Jarislowsky Fraser Ltd., SNC's second-largest shareholder with a 10 per cent stake. SNC's strategy of investing in new infrastructure projects at the expense of more mature assets that offer less growth makes a sale of 407 International inevitable, Durand said in a telephone interview. Card is reshaping Canada's biggest engineering and construction company after a corruption scandal under the previous CEO. Investors including activist fund West Face Capital Inc. have been advocating for the sale of the company's infrastructure concession assets, such as 407 International, to boost shareholder value. SNC agreed to sell its AltaLink power-transmission unit to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. for $3.2 billion in May. SNC then bought oil services group Kentz Corp. in June for $1.97 billion. The transactions increased SNC's resolve to unlock 407 Internationals value, analysts and investors said.

Card, who has been CEO since October 2012, said last month that while the company planned to decide on its 407 International stake in the “mid-term — one to three years,” the AltaLink and Kentz transactions have brought urgency to the process. “Given the success of these two transactions, that will more likely be closer to the front end than the back end of that timeline,” Card said about 407 International in a June 23 interview. Lilly Nguyen, a spokeswoman for SNC in Montreal, declined to comment yesterday on what the company plans to do with its 407 stake. SNC is scheduled to report second-quarter results Aug. 8 before the market opens. Card may discuss plans for the toll- road stake when he hosts a conference call with analysts that day, Durand said.
407 International acquired a 99-year concession in 1999 to operate the 108-kilometre bypass around Toronto. The company is building an eastern expansion of the highway that will probably open to traffic by the end of 2015. SNC spent $175 million in 1999 for an equity stake of about 23 per cent in 407 International and sold part of its holding in 2002 for $178.2 million.

SNC now owns about 17 per cent of 407 International, compared with 43 per cent for Spain's Ferrovial SA and 40 per cent for Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Canada Pension and other pension plans would probably jump at the chance to buy the stake from SNC, said Durand and analysts such as Canaccord Genuity's Yuri Lynk. “There are large strategic buyers out there,” Lynk said in a telephone interview from Montreal. “They could sell 407 International tomorrow if they weren't that price sensitive.” Andre Bourbonnais, Canada Pension senior vice president of private investment, said the country's largest pension fund manager has been happy with its investment in 407 International and it fits well with its long-term investment horizon. “We would be interested in considering the purchase of any additional interest that became available, through the right of first refusal provisions that are available to existing investors or otherwise,” he said in an e-mail. Lynk puts the pretax value of the toll-road asset at $15 for each SNC share, or $2.3 billion. After tax, SNC may receive $12 a share, or $1.8 billion, he said. Maxim Sytchev, an analyst with Dundee Securities, is even more bullish. He estimates the toll road holding is worth $18.99 an SNC share before tax, translating into a total value of about $2.9 billion. Card will have no problem finding projects on which to redeploy cash if he sells the 407 International stake, said Durand at Jarislowsky Fraser. SNC leads one of three groups that the Canadian government this month invited to bid on the construction of a new bridge over the St. Lawrence River between Montreal and its South Shore suburbs. The crossing, which will replace the Champlain Bridge, may cost as much as $5 billion, the government has said.

UKRAINE, September 10, 2013 (LifeSiteNews.com) – If the topless protests organized by the radical feminist group Femen - typically featuring skinny, attractive women - have sometimes seemed like a dirty man's dreams come true, there might be a good reason for that. According to a new documentary, the mastermind behind the group, members of which earlier this year assaulted a Belgian Catholic bishop for his views on homosexuality, was, until recently, a man with a penchant for pretty girls, and a habit of belittling the feminist warriors he led into battle.
“It's his movement and he hand-picked the girls,” filmmaker Kitty Green, who was given intimate access to the feminist group, told the Independent in reference to Viktor Svyatski's influence on Femen. “He hand-picked the prettiest girls because the prettiest girls sell more papers. The prettiest girls get on the front page... that became their image, that became the way they sold the brand.”
Femen, whose slogan is, “Our mission is protest, our weapons are bare breasts”, is famous for staging numerous incendiary protests, such as attacking Archbishop Andre-Joseph Leonard with water, shouts, and curses in April; chanting "Pope no More" in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican; protesting against government plans in Ukraine to outlaw abortion in some circumstances; and chainsawing Orthodox crosses in the wake of the conviction of a Russian punk band.
The revelation of Svyatski's leadership, which has since been confirmed by the group's current leader, has sparked a furor, generating dozens of headlines in leading newspapers, with some commentators declaring that the group has lost credibility.
Green, who identifies herself as a feminist, spent fourteen months living with four Femen activists, developing a close relationship with them. However, during that time, she says began to have reservations about the way Femen managed itself.
“[A]s I got closer to the girls, that picture became more complicated,” she wrote in a press release about her documentary, titled "Ukraine is not a Brothel."
She began to question how the group's “unusual and almost contradictory methods” could make their country a “safer and better place for women.”
When a “slimey Turkish businessman” began using Femen to promote a brand of lingerie, Green realized that she must choose between abandoning her film or “make a film that paints an honest portrait of this movement.”
Green says she chose to be honest.
As Green shot her documentary, she realized that the man Viktor Svyatski was not simply a Femen supporter, but he was actually the organization's primary decision-maker, who controlled everything behind the scenes.
Green said that it was only gradually that she became aware of Svyatski's influence. “Once I was in the inner circle, you can't know him. He is Femen.”
Green claims that she witnessed Svyatski being abusive to the Femen girls he dominated.
“He was quite horrible with the girls. He would scream at them and call them bitches,” she said.
While Svyatski was reportedly hesitant about being interviewed by Green, he eventually agreed. “The girls are weak," he says in the film. "They don't have the strength of character. They don't even have the desire to be strong. Instead, they show submissiveness, spinelessness, lack of punctuality, and many other factors which prevent them from becoming political activists. These are qualities which it was essential to teach them.”
When asked directly if he started Femen “to get girls”, Svyatski replied: “Perhaps yes, somewhere in my deep subconscious.”
Click "like" if you are PRO-LIFE!
In a piece published in response to the controversy this week, Femen leader Inna Shevchenko hotly disputed claims that Svyatski had "founded" the group or that his influence undermined the group's activism, but admitted that he had begun to “dominate” the organization, and called him “sexism, male domination, and oppression against women personified.”
“He was a man in a women's group, he was elder, smarter,” she wrote. “And us, those who were at the first stage of our feminism and activism, we were young and not experienced girls.”
“At the beginning, we didn't know how to resist and fight” Svyatki's leadership. “From that moment on, I realised that the patriarchy was not somewhere outside. It was right in front of us, in Femen's office. And our global fight with patriarchy started with the fight in our own private life,” she wrote.
She also claims that Femen outed Svyatski from the organization not long after Green wrapped up her filming.
Shevchenko said that she is now building a “new Femen” that is facing the “biggest bastards of [the] patriarchal system”.
“During the last year, we did one of the most important acts in the history of the movement: we started our open war with religious institutions when we cut down a Catholic cross in Kiev, when we attacked the Pope in the Vatican and when we started our historical anti Islamists campaign in Tunisia.”
“Femen is a women's power,” wrote Shevchenko. “You can keep criticising us but we will keep fighting. Even if patriarchy is laughing at us today, it will cry in front of us tomorrow!”
Verizon has decided to abruptly cut off wireless internet to some 8,500 rural customers in 13 states, saying their heavy data use had made it impossible to profit off of the accounts—even though many of the users had purchased unlimited plans.
“Approximately 8,500 customers—using a variety of plans—were notified this month that we would no longer be their service provider after October 17th, 2017,” Verizon corporate communications director Kelly Crummey told BGR. “These customers live in 13 states (Alaska, Idaho, Iowa, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Utah and Wisconsin) and in areas outside of where Verizon operates our own network.”

Letters Verizon is sending to the affected customers are blunt, to say the least.
“During a recent review of customer accounts, we discovered you are using a significant amount of data while roaming off the Verizon Wireless network,” Verizon wrote, according to Ars Technica. “While we appreciate you choosing Verizon, after October 17th, 2017, we will no longer offer service for the numbers listed above since your primary place of use is outside the Verizon service area.”
No option to continue, with or without reducing use of mobile data, was given.
Per BGR, the issue stems from Verizon's LTEiRA program, in which the company pairs with 21 regional carriers to provide mobile access to rural regions. Verizon users get to jump on board those regional networks whenever they want, though when they use roaming data Verizon is responsible for paying the carriers' fees.

While Verizon says some of the users were using as much as a terabyte of data monthly, one family reported they had been using less than 50 gigabytes of data across four lines every month on an unlimited data plan.
“Now we are left with very few choices, none of them with good service,” a member of the family told Ars Technica. “I guess small-town America means nothing to these people. It's OK—though I live in a small town, I know a lot of people, and I'm telling every one of them to steer clear of Verizon.”
Verizon's decision has ramifications for the regional carriers as well, which say the company encouraged them to build infrastructure to expand their service areas but is now backing out on the deal.

Though US telecoms have long gotten away with the digital equivalent of murder while providing terrible service, Verizon's decision is particularly ominous given it could soon be given free license to treat rural customers even more poorly. The Federal Communications Commission and its Donald Trump-appointed chairman Ajit Pai have recently sought to slash the agency's standards for what it considers acceptable access to broadband, including by allowing service providers to pass off mobile service as a replacement for home internet—a decision that would disproportionately impact poor Americans.

COQUITLAM, B.C. - After dominating the round robin portion of the 2016 U-19 World Games, the stacked USA team looked like a lock to repeat as world champions. No other team had shown any sign of an answer to USA's plethora of dodgers and shooters, as the Iroquois and Canadian teams had fallen way short earlier in the week. So when Canada went into the locker room at halftime of the championship game up 8-2, the lacrosse world was stunned (besides our Box Director Coach Hopper). This was especially shocking given the fact USA beat up on Canada 12-5 in their opener. Canada's All Tournament goalie Kyle Hebert (Stony Brook) stood on his head while their offensive duo of Tre LeClaire (Ohio State) and Jeff Teat (Cornell) continued to play at the high level that they are known for.
For the United States, down at halftime, it would be a long road back to make the game interesting, and one that needed its fair share of highlight-reel plays. Luckily, attackman Alex Roesner (UPenn) was up to the task as he put in this beautiful behind-the-back goal to bring USA within four goals. Going into the fourth Quarter, Team USA Trailed Canada 8-11 but had all the momentum.

Yes are one of the flagship acts of progressive rock. They're also one of rock's weirdest bands. Their best music is intense and aggressive, incorporating influences from jazz, folk, and country, but blending them with wild synthesizer explorations, crazed art-boogie guitar shredding, bass louder than most metal bands', crushingly complex drumming, and Jon Anderson's unique, highly recognizable upper-register vocals. At their mid-'70s peak, they were imaginative and self-indulgent enough to release a double album with one song on each side; a decade later, they partnered with producer Trevor Horn (Art Of Noise, Frankie Goes To Hollywood) and created one of the biggest hit singles of the '80s. But they've had a staggering number of lineup fluctuations — the only constant presence has been bassist Chris Squire — to the point that their last two singers have been recruited from Yes cover bands. They're some of the most talented and technically skilled musicians in rock history, but it's a safe bet that the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame will burn to the ground before they'll be inducted.
Yes were formed in the summer of 1968 by Chris Squire and Jon Anderson, who recruited guitarist Peter Banks, keyboardist Tony Kaye, and drummer Bill Bruford. They quickly made a name for themselves on the London club scene, and got a prime gig opening Cream's farewell concert at the Royal Albert Hall. Their first two albums were moderately successful, but they didn't really develop their own sound until their third, simply titled The Yes Album. That disc was also Tony Kaye's last work with the group; he was replaced by Rick Wakeman, and the band's classic era commenced.
For the next few years, Yes moved from strength to strength. Each album — Fragile, Close To The Edge, Tales From Topographic Oceans, the live Yessongs — was rapturously received, and they began selling out larger and larger venues. But Tales proved to be a stumble; critics and some fans rebelled against the idea of a four-song double LP. Indeed, the band became poster children for bloated '70s rock excess, with Wakeman a particular figure of fun for things like wearing a cape onstage and ordering takeout dinner delivered to his keyboard during other bandmembers' extended solos. Ultimately, he left the band after the Tales tour, though he'd be back — and gone, and back again.
As the '70s wore on, Yes began to be a band in turmoil. The records got worse (Tormato in particular), and Anderson and Wakeman both quit in 1980, causing the remaining members to absorb new-wave duo the Buggles (Geoff Downes and Trevor Horn) for the Drama album. Then the band flat-out broke up … until 1983, when they came back, with Anderson returned to the fold and Horn producing, and made 90125, their most commercially successful album to date. The first single, “Owner Of A Lonely Heart,” went to #1, and the album sold more than six million copies.
Of course, it couldn't last. The '80s and '90s found the band shedding and regaining members, leaving their original label, Atlantic/Atco, for Arista, then a string of indies, and even seeing four of their key players forming the spinoff group Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe.
These days, Yes are a legacy act. They've released three albums of new material in the 2000s, only one of them with Jon Anderson singing; he left the group for good in 2008, after years of health issues. Their last two singers, Benoît David and Jon Davison, have been former members of Yes cover bands. And while they continue to write and record new material, their concerts are still dominated by 40-year-old songs; indeed, in 2014, they performed a “Three Albums Tour,” during which they played The Yes Album, Close To The Edge and Going For The One in their entirety, and followed that up with a tour showcasing Fragile and Close To The Edge, plus a “greatest hits”/new-material mini-set at the end. (Very sadly, just yesterday, Squire revealed that he has been diagnosed with Acute Erythroid Leukemia, and will be receiving treatment over the next few months. We wish him a speedy recovery.)
This roundup includes every Yes studio album, and the majority of their live releases, including the brand-new, mind-crushing box Progeny: Seven Shows From Seventy-Two, which (as its title implies) includes seven full concerts from the Close To The Edge tour on 14 CDs. I also included the debut by Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe, because honestly it's got more of a claim to being a Yes album than some Yes albums do. I skipped the members' various solo releases, 'cause holy fuck, there are a lot of them, and there are already 33 titles in this roundup. So … enjoy!

“The Crash” - Mad Men / / Insight on the episode
“Every time we get a car this place turns into a whorehouse” were the last words in the most recent installment of AMC's Mad Men, and the absurdity of the statement aptly reflects the chaos that occurred within those 44 minutes. Sunday's episode had the audience diving further into the shrouded ambiguity of Don Draper's past as well the drug soaked onset of the 1970's. It was a welcome addition to the latest season of one of the most popular programs on television, and for damn good reason. The entire season has shown us a Don Draper who has reverted back into his old fashioned (get it?) womanizing patterns, and for a while, it left me wondering how much longer this monumentally troubled businessman could keep flipping his moral compass before completely losing his bearings. That quandary was portrayed in a new light last night, as Don and the rest of SCDP/CGC (or whatever they are going to call it now) undergo a frantic, sleepless trip on methamphetamines.
Right from the get-go, the episode begins with Ken Cosgrove hauling ass in a brand-new Chevy surrounded by what I can only assume to be belligerent Chevy representatives that decided to get drunk off moonshine and start whipping guns out in the car. One of them covers Cosgrove's eyes and then WHAM the titular “crash” occurs, except that Cosgrove isn't the only thing in the episode that crashes. One of the greatest feats Mad Men constantly accomplishes is the show's ability to depict how people flail and crash only to end up burning themselves into the ground or resurrecting themselves in a miraculous flurry of Phoenix feathers, and this episode is no exception.
The episode centers largely on Don and his confrontation with a crash. We first see him in the connecting hallway between his and Sylvia's apartments chain smoking cigarettes, and we can tell that this dude has some serious shit going on his head. Don longingly places his ear to the door, hearing Sylvia call out to her husband and the viewer can just feel the jealousy and defeated rage seeping out of his body. Sylvia's repudiation of Don in last weeks episode crushed him, and if it wasn't obvious from the look on his face as she walked out, we know very clearly now that he isn't handling his business in standard Don Draper fashion. The writers of the show took advantage of Don's weakened state to let us in on a little more about the history of Dick Whitman with flashbacks incorporated throughout the episode.
Before I even get into what Don's flashbacks reveal and what they could possibly mean, I would first like to mention that shortly into the episode, Cutler calls in his special “doctor” to help the men in the office take a load off their shoulders. Of course, this is done by injecting them in the ass with an unspecified concoction of vitamin B and other ingredients. It was never explicitly stated, but the majority of the firm was tripping face on speed, and in between Stan racing up and down office chairs like a bat out of hell and Cosgrove's mangled foot from the car accident functioning enough for him to tap-dance, we have Don losing his fucking mind about soup, beauty marks, the perils of losing his virginity and possibly the ad for the new Chevy car.
The introduction of drug use in Mad Men is expected since the show is naturally following the already established course of history, and we all know how many drugs were coursing through the central nervous system of humanity on the cusp of the 70's. More importantly however, the trip on speed set the framework for the episode, establishing that the audience is going to find themselves in the same entropic haze that the characters are engulfed in. As I struggled to figure out exactly what everyone was freaking out about, I slowly but surely realized that Don was on an entirely different plane than the rest of the firm. While they spent their sleepless weekend narrowing down possibilities for the new Chevy ad (and now I wonder if that's even what they were doing) we find Don digging through archives for an old advertisement made for a soup company and Kramer-ing into a every single room in the office blabbering nonsense about “having it” and “cracking this whole thing wide open.”
I can almost certainly attribute this to the fact that minutes before receiving his injection of speed, we witnessed Don undergoing a nuclear meltdown after getting shot down by Sylvia over the phone, and here, in a moment of unbridled and unfiltered emotion the audience sees just how deep the split with Sylvia cut into him. This is a perfect representation of one the show's major themes: loss. Loss is something that drives some men insane and some to suicide, and here, loss has driven Don Draper into a 120mph crash with a brick wall. Although, I will say how I find it interesting that after Sylvia divulges sincere emotions about her lack of trust for Don, accepting the risk of an affair and what each participant has at stake, all Don can muster up is “don't cry, listen to me. I'm feeling a lot of emotions too.” It makes me wonder if Don is this crushed because of actual, sincere feelings for Sylvia, or if he just feels defeated after losing control of something he thought was his.
From then on, the episode is constant trip through Don's mind. Throughout his ramblings, we are treated to brief glimpses into Don's past, and for once, some lucidity on why Don handles his relationships with women (and possibly with people in general) the way he does is provided. The audience is reintroduced to a young Don, struggling with a shit life in a whorehouse and after coming down with a chest cold, his only source of comfort is provided by a prostitute named Amee who bears a striking resemblance to Sylvia and draws a beauty mark on the same exact side of her face. Amee sits besides Don in bed throughout his convalescence and then immediately takes advantage of him, stripping him of his virginity. So, from an incredibly early age, we see that Don easily found comfort in promiscuous, alluring women who were willing to have sex with him.
In present time, we see Don in an equally crippled state (although this time emotionally rather than physically) and in spite of appearing to be frantically at work towards a breakthrough on the Chevy ad, it dawns on everyone that he has been putting all of the effects of the drug towards pitching the perfect advertisement to win Sylvia back. From this, its painfully apparent that almost everything in Don's life is basically ripping him apart from the inside. He doesn't give two shits about his job or the people there (Frank Gleason died for shits sake and I don't think Don even bats an eyelash), and somehow he cares even less about his family. That second point was driven home in an equally absurd fashion, as the majority of the other scenes in the episode revolve around an elderly black woman breaking into the Draper apartment and robbing them blind through the door Don left unlocked to pine and yearn for Sylvia, all the while Sally and Bobby are home alone. This to me is the ultimate representation of how much of a fuck up Don Draper is turning out to be. When Don gets screwed over, he doesn't think twice about what is going on around him. He focuses strictly on how he can fix his situation, and he hones in on this at a level that borders on sheer obsession.
The complications of getting fucked over because of life decisions is an integral part of the series, and this episode demonstrates exactly how miserable Mr. Big Shot Draper is at dealing with it. Throughout the show it has become increasingly hard to root for him, and even now when he is clawing at his skin, digging through old ads in order to come up with the perfect words to say to a woman to win her back (a situation that Hollywood and TV have trained us to believe in) I find myself wanting to grab Don by the shoulders, slap him across the face and tell him to get his fucking shit together. And when Don finally comes home, ready to present his Shakespearean sales pitch to Sylvia, he is presented with cops in his living room, Betty sitting on his couch calling him out for having an affair in front of Megan and news of the burglary all at once, and the entire weight of Don's life crashes down on his shoulders as he passes out cold.
One of the final scenes in the episode shows us Don and Sylvia on an elevator together. The tension is thin as ice, and Don's only response to Sylvia's inquiry about how life is going is the word “busy.” Clearly, this shows us that Don has gotten over Sylvia as they don't say a word to each other for the remainder of the realistically long elevator ride, but a question remains: does this mean he is going to do the same exact thing again? A person's inability to change is another one of the show's major themes, and after we see Don try his hardest (although the speed probably helped somewhat) to change and attempt to restore a broken, albeit illicit, relationship, what on Earth would make anyone think he would actually change after crashing as horribly as he did.

One more link has emerged between Punjab Power and Irrigation Minister and Congress leader Rana Gurjit Singh and the two successful bids in the sandmine auctions held earlier this year that went in favour of two of his former employees.
Advertising
A second company which transferred cash to a firm that made the transfer for the security deposit on behalf of the two bidders, was set up by the minister himself, documents accessed by The Indian Express from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) show.
The company, RJ Texfab Pvt Ltd., was set up in 1998, and was originally named Rana Fabrics Ltd with Rana Gurjit Singh, wife Rajbans Kaur, son Rana Inderpratap Singh, brother Rana Ranjit Singh and close associate JS Randhawa being among the founders.
It was Randhawa's son Sanjit Randhawa, who wired the security deposit money for the auction bid through his firm Rajbir Enterprises on behalf of the successful bidders, both former employees of the minister, Amit Bahadur and Kulvinder Pal Singh.

Amit Bahadur is named as a Director of RJ Texfab. He bid Rs 26.51 crore for Saidpur and Kulvinder Pal Singh bid Rs 9.31 crore for Mehdipur, two sand mines in Nawashahr district. The auction was held in May.
The two bids have been mired in controversy ever since after it emerged that both were former employees of the minister. The Amarinder Singh government set up a Commission, headed by Justice J S Narang (retd), to investigate if there had been any “impropriety” on the Minister's part.
Both RJ TExfab and RGS Traders are named in the Narang commission report into the bidding and allotment of the two sand mines in Nawanshahar district after the auctions in May this year.
The commission notes that these were among the 23 individual and companies that provided Rajbir Enterprises the money for the bids, but it did not go into the provenance of the funding companies, and exonerated the minister of any wrong doing.
RJ Texfab provided Rs 4.52 crore while RGS Traders deposited Rs 35 lakh; an associate company of RGS Traders, Jay Aar Builders, contributed Rs 36 lakh.
The Indian Express had reported last week that RGS Traders Pvt Ltd was also set up by the minister.
In all, Sanjit Randhawa, proprietor of Rajbir Enterprises, paid close to Rs 18 crore as 50 per cent of the bid amount for the two mines.
Reacting to The Indian Express reports, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh gave a clean chit to his Cabinet Minister. “If I take a loan from Sukhi's (Congress MLA Sukhjinder Randhawa who was sitting next to him at a press conference where he was asked the question) companies and he invests in sand mines that doesn't establish any link,” he said.
However, the CM ignored the fact that in Rana Gurjit's case, his own companies invested in the mines auction.
Documents filed by RJ Texfab with the MCA show that it was in October 21, 2002 that the name of Rana Fabrics Ltd was changed to RJ Texfab Ltd. Records available with the Registrar of Companies of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh further show that the company was given a fresh certificate of incorporation in March 2009 upon conversion to a private limited company and it's name changed to RJ Texfab Pvt Ltd.
As reported by The Indian Express on October 13 and 14, Rana Gurjit Singh also showed financial transaction with these three companies in his election affidavit prior to the Punjab assembly polls.
The financial transactions of RJ Texfab available with the MCA pertaining to the Director's report of 2015 show a large number of unsecured advances made to Rana Gurjit Singh, his wife Rajbans Kaur, his brother Rana Ranjit Singh. The advances made to Rana Gurjit alone, as mentioned in the report, total Rs 4.49 Crore.

Rana Gurjit Singh denied any role in the auction of the mines and said that all his financial transactions are transparent.
Everyone's favourite edgelord from Overwatch, Reaper, has received a fan-made 3D print of his hellfire shotguns with the Nevermore skin.
Each of these prints measure in at 66 centimetres long, so they should be big enough for a properly scaled cosplay or decoration piece.
To get it to look like it does in the game, you're going to need to put a lot of work into finishing and painting it, lest it look like the test prints in the gallery below. Luckily the shaping is spot on, so you need not worry about that.
The files to 3D print these come from Pinshape, where they're unfortunately not free to download. You'll need to pay $7.80 to unlock them.
Alternatively, the creator of the files is also selling completed prints on their Etsy page. That will be $60 for a completed prop, or $110 for the required pair. You'll also need to organise shipping from Russia.
This print joins the ever growing list of props from Overwatch along with some minor additions for Hanzo.
A Times Investigation Are you an independent voter? You aren't if you checked this box The American Independent Party is California's largest third party. A poll shows 73% may be in it by mistake. Are you one of them? With nearly half a million registered members, the American Independent Party is bigger than all of California's other minor parties combined. The ultraconservative party's platform opposes abortion rights and same-sex marriage, and calls for building a fence along the entire United States border. Based in the Solano County home of one of its leaders, the AIP bills itself as “The Fastest Growing Political Party in California." But a Times investigation has found that a majority of its members have registered with the party in error. Nearly three in four people did not realize they had joined the party, a survey of registered AIP voters conducted for The Times found. That mistake could prevent people from casting votes in the June 7 presidential primary, California's most competitive in decades. Voters from all walks of life were confused by the use of the word “independent” in the party's name, according to The Times analysis. Residents of rural and urban communities, students and business owners and top Hollywood celebrities with known Democratic leanings — including Sugar Ray Leonard, Demi Moore and Emma Stone — were among those who believed they were declaring that they preferred no party affiliation when they checked the box for the American Independent Party. Times poll finds 3 in 4 didn't know How AIP members identify themselves AIP members' preferred registration after hearing party platform The survey of 500 AIP California members was conducted by telephone Feb. 9–11. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. Sources: Smith Johnson Research, Tulchin Research | Credit: Angelica Quintero / @latimesgraphics “I just blew it,” said Deborah Silva, 64, of Point Arena in Mendocino County. “There were a number of choices. I just checked the box that said ‘independent.'” Silva said she left the Democratic Party after being at her “wit's end” from the deluge of mail, phone calls and other campaign paraphernalia from Democrats trying to win her vote. While California's top-two primary system allows people to vote for any candidate, regardless of party, presidential primaries have different rules. Republicans have a closed primary this year. Democrats will allow voters registered as having “no party preference” — the state's formal term for an unaffiliated, independent voter — to cast a ballot. But a voter registered with the American Independent Party will only be allowed to vote for presidential candidates on the AIP ballot. “And now, I'm going to have to tell them,” said Jill LaVine, Sacramento County's registrar of voters. “And this is going to hit them hard.” The American Independent Party's roots date back to 1967 when George Wallace, a segregationist, launched his ​second​ run for the White House. Wallace, ​who had run as a Democrat in 1964, helped create the new party and ran on its ticket.​ Today, that party exists only in California. "We're not segregationist anymore,” said Markham Robinson, who serves as chairman of the American Independent Party's executive committee. “What we are now is a conservative, constitutionalist party.” How George Wallace built a party from nothing Segregationist George Wallace ran for president on the American Independent Party ticket. (oldpoliticals.com) At 3% of the state's 17.2 million registered voters, Robinson's party is still vastly outnumbered by Democrats (43%), Republicans (28%) and those stating "no party preference" (24%). Even so, elections officials have watched the AIP ranks grow while quietly voicing suspicions that much of it was due to error, not enthusiasm. “I think the name should be something different,” said Gail Pellerin, Santa Cruz County's registrar of voters. “Right now, it's misleading.” “I had a voter totally break down and cry in my lobby,” Pellerin added, recalling a young woman who wanted to vote in the 2008 Democratic primary between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, but couldn't because she'd registered with the American Independent Party. “The poor thing just sobbed,” Pellerin said. “It's very frustrating.” Other elections officials – from Shasta County to San Diego – offered similar stories. AIP leaders expressed skepticism about The Times findings, but also offered regret. “I'm just sorry that people get confused,” said Mark Seidenberg of Aliso Viejo, the party's chairman. “A lot of people just don't understand what they're doing when they fill out a form.” Of the 500 AIP voters surveyed by a bipartisan team of pollsters, fewer than 4% could correctly identify their own registration as a member of the American Independent Party. “That's what we call a finding with real statistical viability,” said Ben Tulchin, a Democratic pollster who helped craft the survey in collaboration with The Times and Republican pollster Val Smith. “It's overwhelming and it's indisputable.” Tulchin has done polling for Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign and Smith's firm has done polling of California Republican voters on their presidential preferences. No data from this poll, conducted on a pro-bono basis for The Times, was shared with any campaigns.

After being asked questions about their registration, voters were read a series of statements from the American Independent Party's official platform, a combination of specific and broad political beliefs. It calls for abiding by duties given to “all men” by “the God they are commanded to love.” It supports a “pro-life Constitution” and proclaims that marriage between a man and a woman is a “God-ordained contract.” And the platform supports what the party labels as the 2nd Amendment's “right to self defense” and calls for building a fence around the entire United States border. After being read excerpts of the platform, more than 50% of those surveyed in the poll said they wanted to leave the American Independent Party. The more specific the platform position, the weaker the support of those surveyed. Most of the voters who were polled knew little, if anything, about the party to which they belong. “The majority of those that are registered that way has some degree of confusion,” said Smith, a veteran who has conducted more than 400 polls for Republicans. Share your story Amanda Cabanilla, a student at Whittier College, shared her story of being an accidential AIP member. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times) Count Amanda Cabanilla, 25, among them. The one-time Democrat changed her registration with the intention of being independent of all political parties. After she was contacted by The Times' pollsters, she researched the AIP. “I couldn't believe what I was looking at,” she said later. “They are far to the right of the Republican Party, and their ‘independence' kind of has the implication that they're a more centrist or moderate party.” The Times obtained the list of all Californians registered with the American Independent Party through a public records act request. A review of the rolls discovered the names of some well-known celebrities, verified by their birth dates. Most of them said their registration in the party was a mistake. “The views of this party do not accurately reflect my personal beliefs and I am not affiliated with any political party,” Kaley Cuoco, best known for her role on “The Big Bang Theory,” said in a statement to The Times. “As such, I am taking the necessary steps to immediately remove my name as a member of this voting party.” Stone and Leonard plan to re-register before the June election, representatives told The Times. Moore has both contributed money to and campaigned for President Obama. Her registration as an AIP member is wrong, a representative said. “Demi Moore is not, nor has ever been, a member of the American Independent Party,” the representative said. “Any record that states otherwise is a mistake.”

Dutch and American researchers have developed waders equipped with temperature sensors that enable fly-fishers to find the best fishing locations while collecting data to help scientists study streams. The research is published today (29 February) in Geoscientific Instrumentation, Methods and Data Systems (GI), an open access journal of the European Geosciences Union.
"As scientists, we hope these data help us better understand where groundwater enters streams and where streamwater drains away to the groundwater," explains Rolf Hut, a hydrologist at the Delft University of Technology and lead author of the study. "Furthermore, fly fishers themselves could benefit from knowing local stream temperature to find optimal fishing locations."
The team's idea, which emerged from a conversation between Hut and Scott Tyler from the University of Nevada, is simple: equip waders with low-cost sensors that measure water temperature and send the readings to the wearer's GPS-equipped smartphone via Bluetooth. Anglers could use this data right away and move to locations in the stream likely to have more fish. At the same time, the phone can upload both GPS location and temperature information to a central database, making it available to hydrologists.
"In just the USA alone, an estimated 27 million recreational anglers regularly fish in freshwater streams and lakes," says Tim van Emmerik, a hydrologist at Delft University of Technology and co-author of the GI study. "Imagine if they were all equipped with a temperature-sensing wader! This would mean a constant supply of new, accurate data, which can be used to estimate water quality and quantity, fish 'hotspots', and overall state of the ecosystem."
Since interactions between ground- and surface water are complex and vary widely between different streams, scientists need sensors measuring hydrological data at various points along various streams to better study them. "Ultimately, good understanding of stream dynamics helps us advise policies that better balance multiple use of streamwater: as a natural habitat for plants and animals, and as a human drinking resource and place for recreation," explains Hut.
After walking around in prototype temperature-sensing waders at a poster hall of the European Geosciences Union General Assembly last April, Hut and his colleagues did precise field and lab experiments to test and calibrate their waders.
Hut walked around a stream in the Dutch countryside with the prototype and compared the water temperature measured by the sensor in his waders to that collected by a reference thermometer. Back in the lab, the team tested how long it took for the waders to change temperature when exposed to a drop or rise in temperature, and how heat emanating from the wearer's leg would influence the measurements.
"We have now demonstrated that this prototype is capable of measuring the type of temperature changes we are interested in," says Hut. "It works!"
The next step is to discuss with manufacturers of waders how to best incorporate sensors in them. The team also want to reach out to fishing enthusiasts, conservation groups and school students to get as many people as possible to wear the temperature-sensing waders.
"This work really is an example of how relatively simple measurement devices can be fused with existing equipment to actively involve communities in gathering scientific data," concludes van Emmerik. "It's becoming a trend to find ways to incorporate 'alternative' communities in science. Whether it's school kids or fishermen, studies like ours demonstrate that everyone can be a scientist."
Here in Charlottesville, Donald Trump has taken away our sense of safety
Doug Turnbull Blocked Unblock Follow Aug 16, 2017
Those of us that live here knew to Unite the Right rally was coming. We knew there'd be Nazis from all over the country descending on Charlottesville. In most local's minds, we expected a larger version of a July event when dozens of North Carolina KKK drove into town, protested a while, and went back home. Locals would be angry, it would be in the national news for a day, and we'd all go back to work on Monday.
We should have listened to activitists like Emily Gorcenski who warned us this time would be tragically different.
The Nazi intimidation of Charlottesville went far beyond the actual rally. Intimidation started Friday at the University, where Nazis surrounded teenage University students who stood arm in arm around a statue of Thomas Jefferson
It continued Saturday with the tragic death of Heather Heyer by James Fields. And further with the deaths of two Virginia state troopers H. Jay Cullen and M. M. Bates. Saturday also included the beating of Deandre Harris, a teacher's assistant at my son's elementary school.
It didn't end until Monday when Matthew Heimbach came and promised they'd be back. Whatever other crazy he spouted, promising they'd come back chilled Charlottesville residents to the bone.
The Nazi intimidation stories you haven't heard
The more you talk to people around Charlottesville, the more you hear hundreds of little stories about Nazis bullying locals, vandalizing, and making threats throughout the weekend.
On Sunday I took my son for a haircut. As I drove back into our neighborhood, I witnessed a verbal altercation between my black neighbor and two Nazis. I am ashamed to say, fearing for my son, that I kept driving. When I got my son home, I walked up to the street corner and the Nazis were gone. I couldn't sleep that night of shame for not standing up for my neighbor.
Sunday morning I took my two year old son jogging. We jogged by Wesley Memorial Methodist Church. Little old ladies were sweeping car glass. Cars with slash tires were all throughout the lot. Apparently Nazis had come through Friday evening during their torch-lite march and vandalized the church, broken car windows, and slashed tires.
Hundreds of other little stories abound, including little things like cars driving 20 mph down our major highway for the sole purpose of disruption. Nazis waving guns at Walmart. Tire fires in the highway.
I learned from folks at the University, that Nazis thoroughly coordinated Friday night's rally to maximize terror. They chose a location where very few police would be stationed. They further dispersed the police by calling in bomb threats at distant locations. They told University officials there'd be a “minor gathering” there which turned out anything but.
There's not two sides
Whatever brawls broke out Saturday at the short-lived rally, there's one guilty side here: the Nazis that systematically terrorized my town all weekend. The whole weekend was a systematic, coordinated spree of intimidation.
The “other side”, aka the people who live here, didn't ask for this. We had to choose between leaving town in fear, hunkering down at home, or getting caught up in the counterprotests. We couldn't live our lives last weekend. We didn't feel safe.
To keep our kids safe, we took them to a Zoo an hour away. We kept a smiling face with the kids, while we stared in shock at our Twitter feeds. It felt like living a lie, adults whispering too each other about what's happening. Adults trying to focus on having fun with kids. Meanwhile a Nazi is driving a car into a group of counter protestors where our kids have strolled hundreds of times.
Those who keep believing a “two sides” narrative insult those of us who lived through this. Antifa, the “alt left” or whatever fake boogeyman didn't plan this event. They didn't work hard to make us feel unsafe. That responsibility falls squarely on racist Alt Right Nazis.
Thanks Donald
A president interprets our country's founding principles. By legitimizing Nazis, President Trump aligns these principles to the intimidation and terror. By saying “fine people” marched with white supremacists, he creates a loophole where you can be both a terrorist and a patriot.
This is what makes us feel most intimidated. Our town now sits prone, vulnerable to enabled so-called “patriots” who feel it is their constitutional duty to purge the United States of non-whites and the political opposition. Millions more Americans who don't pay attention can go back to work, comforted by notions of “well both sides are bad.”
Meanwhile, white supremacists like David Duke and Nazi newspaper the Daily Stormer interpret Trump's words as support. They'll continue to act as though, as David Duke puts it, they “fulfill the promises of Donald Trump.” How hard is it to denounce thoroughly enough as to not leave David Duke and the Daily Stormer in doubt? Arnold Schwarzenegger and Nordstroms know exactly where Donald Trump stands on them.
We feel unsafe, knowing this “two sides” narrative molifies the complacent while the Nazis feel free to terrorize in the name of the President of the United States.
Donald Trump crafted this narrative. He bears responsibility not only for inviting these people into his coalition, but also continuing to flirt with extremists. By letting Nazis feel like patriots, he brought this to our town.
Missing Comfort and Closure
Tragedy happens. As a Virginia Tech alumni, I remember the Virginia Tech shootings of 2007. An unexpected tragedy that built through the day, and left me heartbroken. But watch President what George W. Bush did:
I didn't vote for President Bush. At the time, I considered his presidency a disaster. But he was able to help us heal. When he gave this speech, his approval rating was close to 30%. He probably wasn't particularly popular in the liberal University town where Blacksburg is located.
Yet the University, and Virginia's leadership welcomed his guidance and comfort. Governor Tim Kaine praised Bush. Bush was able to emote beyond reptillian instincts or ego protection. Bush did not see himself as the biggest victim of the Virginia Tech shooting. He spoke with humility and students appreciated his presence and words, despite being an even more unpopular president than Trump is today.
In many ways the Charlottesville tragedy remains an open wound in a way many others have turned into scars. We have no closure and there's nobody coming to re-establish our sense of community or redirect the moral impulses of our country towards a healthy direction.
The one-two punches. It's not getting better
With nobody to comfort the victims. And the Nazis even more empowered to terrorize, it's a huge gut punch. Not only did we experience a thoroughly unexpected tragedy, we will receive no help. Our country's moral universe seems to be wrapping itself around Nazis. Simultaneously, the GOP, who have power to do something, continue to prevaricate, letting themselves be lead by Trump voters.
Not only did a tragedy happen, the odds of another happening have gone up, and we're on our own. Nobody is riding to our rescue. Things feel like they'll only get worse. Much of the public has chosen to be decieved. And Charlottesville, the home town of Thomas Jefferson, is now on the front lines.
A 3-year-old child was attacked by two pit bulls on Sunday while she was walking with her older sister and a friend on Azalea Drive.
According to the Niceville Police Department, the three girls had taken the two dogs for a walk and were returning to the dogs' owner's residence when the dogs began fighting with each other. The victim reportedly walked in front of the dogs, who then stopped fighting each other and turned their attention to the child.
Witnesses told the police the two other girls were screaming and trying to get the dogs off of the victim while the pit bulls were attacking her. Neighbors Hannah and Chris Merrell heard the screaming and ran to assist. Hannah pulled the little girl away from the dogs while Chris tried to get the dogs away, the police report said.
While Hannah was running back with the victim to her house, one of the dogs chased her and bit her on the back, the report said.
The dog's owner, Joseph Jordan, told police he did not hear the girls screaming, and only went outside because his other dog was barking. Police contacted the Panhandle Animal Welfare Society, who removed the dogs from the residence, the report said.
The victim was stabilized at Twin Cities Hospital and then taken by helicopter to Sacred Heart Hospital in Pensacola, according to the report. While the child's status was not available at press time, police say bite and scratch wounds covered her from head to toe.
Samsung has made us all wait quite a bit for the Marshmallow update and now it has finally released Android 6.0.1 for the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 edge in South Korea. The release follows a brief beta test program in which users were allowed to sign up to test beta Marshmallow firmware. We've already posted a lot of images of all the interface changes and new features that are included in the Marshmallow update.
It has only released Marshmallow for the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 edge today but it shouldn't take too long for the update to arrive for the Galaxy S6 edge+ and the Galaxy Note 5 at least in South Korea. It's unclear when Samsung is going to roll out the update for other markets. Given that it has started the rollout users in other markets may not have to wait for too long now.

EUCLID, Ohio -- The deteriorating noise walls on Interstate 90 in Euclid will be replaced this summer in a $3 million project the Ohio Department of Transportation admits is badly needed.
"We got many, many complaints about how ugly they are looking," said Jocelynn Clemings, spokeswoman for the ODOT district that includes Euclid.
Work last summer to patch and paint the 17-year-old concrete walls between East 200th and East 260th streets and install "Euclid" icons didn't help, she said.
Euclid Mayor Bill Cervenik agreed.
"I really started getting calls after that because people thought they weren't going to be replaced," he said.
And the walls looked even worse because they are just west of recently installed concrete noise walls in Wickliffe, extending over the Euclid border, that look like burnished red brick, he said.
The 15- to 20-foot high aging walls, stretching for 2.5 miles on the north side of the highway, were among the first of group of sound barriers built in Northeast Ohio in 1993. At that time ODOT built 9.3 miles of walls on Interstates 90, 71, 271 and 480.
ODOT said last year it didn't know when funding would be available to replace the walls.
Cervenik said he sent the agency a letter last November that included photos of portions of the wall where chunks of concrete had fallen out. He said he also contacted legislators and Gov. Ted Strickland's office.
ODOT amended this year's budget to include the wall project. The contract is to be awarded in June. Federal funds will cover 90 percent of the cost and state funding the remainder.
The existing concrete walls, which have a hollow center, will be replaced with solid concrete panels with a red-brick treatment similar to those in Lake County, ODOT said. The agency will install a concrete sleeve over the existing steel columns between the panels.
More evidence for the effects of an anti-depressant that can really affect sufferers of ‘treatment-less' depression has been uncovered by clinical trials, headed by Dr Carlos Zarate, for the National Institute of Health earlier this year. The drug known affectionately as AZD6765 works by blocking the binding of the neurotransmitter glutamate at the NMDA receptors located upon the neurons within nerve cells. The NMDA receptors are the site of action for many psychotropic substances, including hallucinatory drugs such as ketamine. I have discussed the technical side of ketamine in my article The Action of Ketamine on Brains & Society in the Psychedelic Press UK. AZD6765 works in the exact same way as ketamine but with fewer things people may describe as ‘side-effects' – depending on your views or mindset, the term ‘adverse' or ‘propitious' could proceed here to help us penetrate to the essentials – in this case, the ambiguous term ‘fewer side-effects' translates into a reality of ‘less psychotropic effects'. In a clinical sense this is advantageous for the treatment of clinically depressed patients. One does not need to be an objective bystander remotely viewing oneself, surrounded by unfolding chrome volumetric curves, if all one wishes to do is muster the courage to go outside for some groceries.
Ketamine can also give what doctors call a ‘residual anti-depressant effect' for up to a week after the original dose. A ‘residual anti-depressant effect' can be explained with terms akin to a ‘warm afterglow'. This psychosomatic ‘warmth' that is so often experienced in the days after a session using certain compounds, in particular psychedelic psychoactives. AZD6765 has been shown to give a ‘residual anti-depressant effect' for merely two days after procurement. It also allows for a rapid onset of effects, between 1-2 hours, according to the trials, and helps to eliminate severe depression for up to 30 minutes. So what we seem to have here is a ‘ketamine light'. Dr Carlos Zarate's trials revealed that only 32% of the patients tested showed an anti-depressant response to the drug, compared to 52% of the same patients registering meaningful anti-depressant responses to ketamine. The figure of 32% is still significant enough to be above the expected result for a placebo, so the work in general can be seen as encouraging. Such encouragement is derived from the progress in development of ‘glutamate blocker based' anti-depressants in the treatment of clinically depressed patients who have grown immune to benzodiazepine derivatives. Further studies on AZD6765 are ongoing, especially in regards to the effects of acute and chronic dosage within fixed periods of time. It's only a matter of time before we should start to see major elaborations on and within the treatment of depression, in regards to non-benzodiazepine based anti-depressants, which haven't exactly dominated psychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry over the past 40 years.

Graphics card performance
We test at Ultra quality settings. Your sweet spot might be high quality and 1080P if you have less than 3GB of graphics memory. 3GB graphics memory (often referred to as VRAM) really is a sweet-spot for the game. For PC gaming your goal always should be 60+ FPS. However, we say 40~45 FPS for a game of this type should be your threshold, while 60 FPS (frames per second) or higher can be considered optimal.
** Update: Nvidia released a new driver which massively impacts performance. The results have been updated but we'd not be surprized to see something similar happening with AMD drivers. hence the results today remain subjective. The game is incredible hard to measure objectively.
** Update #2: after lots of weird results with graphics card that have less than 4 GB of VRAM we found out that the problematic settings is Shadow cache. If you have an up-to 4 GB graphics card, please turn it off and you'll be playing properly. The charts are now updated to reflect that.
The type of game you play is always relevant though, an first-person shooter game is nice at 50 to 60 fps , an online shooter on a 144Hz monitor feels better at 100+ fps. And totally on the opposing side, for RPG gaming things are different for which we are comfortable with an FPS ranging as low as 30~35 FPS. At all times if your framerate is low, you can opt to change in-game image quality settings. Mind you that we test with reference cards or cards that have been clocked at reference frequencies. Factory tweaked graphics cards obviously can run up-to 20% faster. But for the generic overview, we treat all card the same.
In the video above you can see a GeForce GTX 1080 rendering the game @ 1920x1080
A bit of a mess ...
Yes the results are all over the place. The game can jump from 100 to 50 FPS in no time. The frame-drops are massive making the FPS recordings very difficult. We also see very weird behaviour for the Fury series and for Nvidia the GTX 970/980 the results have been so weird that we cannot trust a steady FPS mark, hence we left them out. It is weird to observe among many other things. The good news though with all the performance differences, the overall framerate is easily above the 40 FPS marker, so the weird FPS fluctuations for pretty much any card are at a speed that you will hardly notice it, at 1080P that is.
For both Nvidia and AMD their latest generation cards however excel, Polaris works extremely well as all Pascal GPUs for Nvidia.
Mark Morgan's soundtrack was among the more distinctive aspects of the classic PC role-playing game Planescape: Torment. An odd, dirge-like collection of tones that was as much about atmosphere as it was about melody, it captured the game's dark vibe perfectly.
The Kickstarter campaign for the game's "spiritual successor," Torment: Tides of Numenera, has been popping off, not yet halfway through its run and already having blown past its initial goal of $900,000.
The folks at Inxile have already posted some of the music that Morgan has composed for the game, and they've sent along another track for us to share.
This music is called "The Bloom," named for the area in the game with the same name. Here's Inxile's Colin McComb on the Bloom, which should put you in the right state of mind for the music:
The Bloom is a vast, semi-sentient predator, a monstrous, organic creation that extends its tendrils through the folds of reality. Its pathways, nooks, and crannies conceal terrors and wonders alike, and for those daring or desperate souls who are forced to find refuge here, any step has the potential to send them to another world. It's a hub, a center of commerce for those who trade in the relics of other worlds.

Nifty. I hear some stray piano keys in there.
And, since we're all here, here's another track of Morgan's music that Inxile has shared.
Death, Taxes, and a Lebron James NBA Finals appearance are the only three things you can't avoid in this world.
Lebron James is one of the top 3 players ever, a certified GOAT contender, and when he's unstoppable it's magnificent. This is not one of those times. The 2017 GSW are the best team in the NBA. Lebron James is the best player in the NBA. One of these bests must give coming next week, and it's going to be Lebron James.
Let's look back to last year's finals and that now infamous blown 3-1 lead against the King, specifically games 5 and 6 the most pivotal. Game 5 saw Draymond Green excuse himself from playing in the finals and Bogut go down. In game 6 we see Iggy get debilitated for the rest of the finals. Lebron started smelling blood, and just like one of the GOATs he is, he took advantage of it and made history for his city and team. However, that's not happening this year and for a few good reasons. The main of which is an import from a small town in Oklahoma.
This isn't 2016 Golden State. The Warriors have four defensive answers to Lebron James. Not to say Lebron will be stopped, he's the King for a reason, but this series will be difficult for him like no other this postseason. After having a run embarrassing big men in the East, Lebron is going to have to go against a team built defensively around great rim protection. Kevin Durant has been swatting shots this season like he doesn't pull up from 30 feet on the other end of the court. Javale McGee has turned into the new Marcus Camby from the bench, and his protection of the bench is going to be vital. James isn't going to have the free reign of the paint that he had against Boston. The length, athleticism, and team defense of GS aren't going to allow it. Golden State is going into this series with the best defense in these playoffs with opponents averaging 99.1 pts per 100 possessions. With it being lower at 94.1 with Draymond on the field, Golden State has to be feeling good with their defense heading into the finals.
Who's guarding Kevin Durant on the perimeter? Kevin Love? Not really. Lebron is most likely to be tasked with guarding KD and this is going to weigh heavily on the series. I think KD is mentally prepared for the finals this time, unlike in 2012 (being on arguably the best team ever eases a lot of qualms). With Golden State abusing screens, Cleveland is going to need to be sharp on all their rotations. Tristan Thomspon is going to be key in this aspect. Thompson has been able to hold GS to .86 points per screen when he picks up the defender afterward. If Thompson is kept out of foul trouble, a vital role this series for him, he'll probably be tasked with hedging defenders the whole series. Iman Shumpert is also going to be needed in this series to try to keep Klay's quiet playoffs in check.
Something that people overlook is Cleveland's three-point shooting ability. Last year Lebron was able to collapse the defense around him so well that Love, Frye, and Smith were able to keep burying their opponents on the perimeter. That's not likely to happen this year. Cleveland is somewhat normal behind the line these playoffs. Love is going to need to help force that issue in the finals. With Golden State being so good defensively, Love is going to have to spread the floor more reliably. Love is going to have to be more aggressive in general in the finals. Kyrie just had his best game of the playoffs being aggressive and just like last year, it's going to take him being able to take over for Lebron if they want to repeat as champions. Because on the other end of the floor if KD is slipping, which for him would probably be two missed shots in a row, who's next in line to pick up from there? Just Steph Curry.
2016 saw a stacked 73-9 Golden State team collapse to Lebron James who was on a mission. This year's Warriors team is even better than that team. Lebron is going to have to play at a level that we've all seen, but this time he's going to need to never drop from that grace. There's just too much on Golden State this time. Last year was one of the most magical, storybook NBA finals the league has ever seen. We saw a King put on the ropes and then conquer the champions. This isn't last year.
Prediction: Golden State in 4.

Last week, I asked how fast one could remove spaces from a string using ARM processors. On a particular benchmark, I got 2.4 cycles per byte using regular (scalar) code and as little as 1.8 cycles per byte using ARM NEON instructions. These are “vectorized instructions” that you find in virtually all ARM processors. Vectorized instructions operate over wide registers (spanning at least 16 bytes), often executing the same operation (such as addition or multiplication) over several values at once. However, my trick using ARM NEON instructions relied on the fact that my input stream would contain few spaces. So it was not a very positive blog post for ARM processors.
But then I got feedback from several experts such as Martins Mozeiko, Cyril Lashkevich and Derek Ledbetter. This feedback made me realize that I had grossly underestimated the power of ARM NEON instructions. One reason for my mistake is that I had been looking at older ARM NEON instructions instead of the current AArch64 instructions, which are much more powerful.
To recap, on an x64 processor, you can remove spaces from strings very quickly using vectorized instructions in the following manner:
Compare 16 bytes of input characters with white space characters to determine where (if anywhere) there are white space characters.
The result of the comparison is itself a 16-byte register, where matching characters have the byte value 255 whereas non-matching characters have the byte value 0. Turn this vector register to a 16-bit integer value by “downsampling” the bits. This can be achieved by a “movemask” instruction present in all x64 processors since the introduction of the Pentium 4 a long time ago.
From this mask, compute the number of white space characters by counting the 1s. This can be done with the popcnt instruction.
instruction. From this mask also, load up a “shuffling register” that tells you how to reorder the bytes so that white space characters are omitted. Then use what Intel and AMD call a “shuffling instruction” ( pshufb introduced with the SSSE3 instruction set many years ago) to quickly reorder the bytes.
I thought that the same could not be done with ARM NEON, but I was wrong. If you have access to recent AMD processors (supporting AArch64), then you can closely mimic the x64 processors and get good performance.
Let us review the various components.
To start, we can quickly compare 16 byte values with the byte value 33 to quickly identify common white space characters such as the space, the line ending, the carriage return and so forth.
uint8x16_t is_nonwhite ( uint8x16_t data ) { return vcgeq_u8 ( data , vdupq_n_u8 ( ' ' + 1 ) ) ; }
ARM NEON has convenient “reduce” instructions, so I can sum up the values of a vector. I can put this to go use to quickly compute how many matching characters I have:
uint8_t bytepopcount ( uint8x16_t v ) { return vaddvq_u8 ( vshrq_n_u8 ( v , 7 ) ) ; }
To compute a 16-bit mask, I also use such a reduce function after computing the bitwise AND of my comparison with some convenient vector (which allows me to distinguish which characters match)…
uint16_t neonmovemask_addv ( uint8x16_t input8 ) { uint16x8_t input = vreinterpretq_u16_u8 ( input8 ) ; const uint16x8_t bitmask = { 0x0101 , 0x0202 , 0x0404 , 0x0808 , 0x1010 , 0x2020 , 0x4040 , 0x8080 } ; uint16x8_t minput = vandq_u16 ( input , bitmask ) ; return vaddvq_u16 ( minput ) ; }
Finally, I call a Vector Table Lookup instruction which is pretty much equivalent to Intel/AMD's shuffle instruction:
int mask16bits = neonmovemask_addv ( data ) ; uint8x16_t shuf = vld1q_u8 ( shufmask + 16 * mask16bits ) ; uint8x16_t reshuf = vqtbl1q_u8 ( data , shuf ) ;
Of course, I am not explaining everything in detail. My full source code is available. All you need is access to a recent ARM processor with Linux running on it, and you are all set to run it.
It turns out that we can double my previous best score:
scalar 1.40 ns NEON (old code) 0.92 ns NEON (Vector Table Lookup) 0.52 ns
What is better is that my new code is effectively branchless: its performance is not very sensitive to the input data.
Using the fact that I know the clock speed of my processor, I can make a quick comparison in terms of CPU cycles per input byte…
scalar ARM recent x64 scalar 2.4 cycles 1.2 cycles vectorized (NEON AArch64 and SSSE3) 0.88 cycles 0.25 cycles
(The source code for x64 processors is available on GitHub.)
What is interesting is that we are getting under one cycle per input byte which is a kind of performance that is difficult to achieve with scalar code that writes byte values one by one. It is still the case that the ARM NEON code is over three times slower than the equivalent on x64 processors, but I am using a relatively weak core (A57 on a Softiron Overdrive 1000) and my code might be subject to further optimization.
NORTH CENTER — Think cider is too sweet?
Brian Rutzen, cider director at the Northman cider bar, has a question for you.
"How many ciders have you had?"
Northman, 4337 N. Lincoln Ave., carries more than 100 varieties — its list of ciders available on draft or in bottles is like the "War and Peace" of beverage menus — and that only begins to scratch the surface of the range of ciders produced across the globe.
Yet most Americans' experience with hard cider is likely confined to one or two major brands, in the way that Budweiser and Miller once dominated beer.

As one of Chicago's foremost cider evangelists, Rutzen said his aim is to bring the spirit, energy and creativity of the craft beer movement to cider.
But first he needs to overcome some long-entrenched misconceptions about the beverage.
MYTH: CIDER IS JUST APPLE JUICE FOR ADULTS

There's no getting around the fact that cider is made from apples. Except for when it's not — there are pear, cherry, strawberry and even rhubarb ciders.
So yes there are ciders that taste like apple juice, the same way there are wines that taste like grape jelly, but others are dry or acidic or downright "funky," which is one of Rutzen's favorite descriptors.
There are ciders blended with cold brew coffee, aged in gin barrels, made from heirloom apples, spiced with habanero peppers and there's even a drinking cider vinegar.
"This is the grand adventure," Rutzen said. "You want to find things that are weird."
One reason the Northman greets guests with a sampling of the bar's house cider, which lands somewhere in the middle of the cider spectrum, is to establish a baseline for patrons.
"It's to help our staff help you, to guide you, to find your preference," Rutzen explained.
The key is for customers to keep an open mind, he said.
"Your first [cider] might not be your favorite," Rutzen said. "Hey, it's not real estate."
MYTH: AMERICANS DON'T LIKE CIDER
Prohibition devastated cider consumption in the United States but the beverage remains popular in France, England and Spain. [Flickr/Yves Remedios]
Rutzen became a cider convert while volunteering at ... a beer fest, camping out with friends during Wisconsin's annual Great Taste of the Midwest.
"We would get a truck full of apples and press them," he said.
"I was getting my hands dirty and it was fun. So I fell in love with the process and then the product. I thought, 'Why can't I find this stuff anywhere?' " Rutzen recalled.
Educated as an historian and a librarian, Rutzen dove into research on American's relationship with cider and discovered "this was a cider-drinking culture for centuries."
When the country was young, not only was cider accessible and easy to make, it was a necessity given the lack of safe drinking water.
Then Germans and Czechs "invented" lagers, and beer, formerly dark and murky, was suddenly clear and bubbly.
"Beer took off ... it became a craze," Rutzen said. "Cider became associated with rural hicks and your grandparents."
Cider was already on the ropes when Prohibition came along and delivered the knockout punch, as cider orchards were cut down for eating apples.
"We had a rich [cider] tradition but we lost it," Rutzen said.
Cider has only recently beginning to rebound from those earlier setbacks. An industry gathering of cider makers, dubbed "CiderCon," attracted all of about 25 attendees in 2010, though it's now grown to 3,000 in 2016, Rutzen said.
Cider's slow climb back into the marketplace has been hampered by a couple of factors, he said.
One is the built-in bias most bar managers have against the beverage. Rutzen said his past efforts to help cider makers break into Chicago's pubs and taverns frequently met with skepticism.
"I got laughed out of many doors. A lot of people would say, 'We have a cider.' I'm like, 'OK, but you have 10 IPAs on draft,'" he said.
Though cider consumption in the United States lags, percentage-wise, that of countries including France, Great Britain and Spain, "If cider were a beer category, it would be the third largest behind IPA and wheat beers," Rutzen said.
MYTH: CIDER IS WIMPY
Think cider's wimpy? Pommeau — a mix of apple juice and apple brandy — can pack a wallop. [Flickr/Connie Ma]
The perception that real men don't drink cider is just that — perception, Rutzen said.
"We're the only country in the world that thinks that way. It's American machismo," he said.
In fact, cider consumption is split roughly 50-50 between men and women, according to Rutzen.
Also not true, he said, is the notion that cider packs a comparatively weak alcoholic punch compared with beer and wine.
If a buzz is what consumers are after, Northman has a cider on draft that's 11 percent alcohol by volume, and also stocks plenty of pommeau, a mix of apple juice and apple brandy, which can hit 18 percent alcohol by volume, Rutzen said.
Perhaps the biggest task ahead of Rutzen is to get people to stop thinking so hard about their beverage choices.
"It's not open-heart surgery, this is food and drink," he said. "Have fun."

On Evolution
In the comments, Jgress asks:
How would acceptance of Darwinism fit into this picture? My impression of most of the neoreactionary blogosphere is that evolution is not questioned and is more or less held to account for everything significant about human nature. I see only the Christian Traditionalists as being perhaps a bit skeptical, but my reading of blogs like Bruce Charlton or Chronicles indicates that whatever philosophical or theological problems they see in Darwinism, they are unwilling to embrace creationism or ID.
The Cathedral does not preach evolution; the Cathedral doesn't believe in evolution, except as a tool for shaming fundamentalists and beating them into submission about other issues. If certain Traditionalists in the reacto-sphere don't believe in evolution, that puts them on the opposite side of things in this one case. They know it, I suppose, and that's why most of them just don't bring it up.
The fact is, most creationists and ID'ers have more in common with the Cathedral than they would care to admit. Dinesh D'Souza's book What's So Great About Christianity has an entire section devoted to “Christianity and Science,” in which D'Souza* toes the same line as the Cathedral: evolution stops at the neck, and it's something that happened a long time ago, doesn't concern us today. He quotes Stephen J. Gould at multiple points in order to “refute” the likes of Dawkins and Dennett (who, for all their flaws, are much closer to HBD than Gould). Watch Ben Stein's Expelled, the intelligent design movie. At one point, Stein starts equating evolution with Nazism, and he sounds just like a Professor of LGBT Studies equating sociobiology with racism. A lot of creationists are big fans of G.K. Chesterton, who advocated for a political system called distributism, which was essentially repackaged Communism. Conservative evangelicals—especially the ones combating The New Atheism—are always jumping at the bit waiting to tell you about how it was Christians (good, anti-Darwinian Christians!!) who were at the forefront of the abolition movement and the Civil Rights movement. Lutheran and Catholic charities—the ones importing third-world refugees by the vanload—are typically run by the same sorts of Christians who buy Dinesh D'Souza books; they're anti-evolution at the bare minimum, creationists by default.
You need to ask yourself: how many evangelical, Bible literalist church-goers do you think would love to come together for Bible study, fellowship, soda pops, and some old fashioned discussion about the failure of American democracy and the average IQ of Asians versus Haitians?
Outside the American South, the Christian Traditionalists of the reacto-sphere would be pariahs in any evangelical community espousing Bible literalism and disregarding evolution. Such communities are on the fringes of the Cathedral, yes, but still miles from neoreaction. Even the most “conservative” religious communities in Southern California—my homeland—would never suffer conversation about issues discussed in the reacto-sphere. You send one of those pastors a link to Chateau or Foesti—hell, even hbd chick—they'll start praying for you.
But none of this should be a point of contention for the anti-evolution Traditionalists. The Dark Enlightenment is Dark precisely because it has followed the evidence where it leads, which turns out to be—in a great historical irony—right back to some of the conclusions (emphasis on some of the conclusions) reached by certain Christians pre-Darwin, the intellectual descendants of whom now inhabit the Christian Traditionalist end of the reacto-sphere.
The great divide between, say, John Derbyshire and Dalrock is that the former is a reactionary because he realizes society is ordered against natural reality; the latter is a reactionary because he realizes society is ordered against an old-school understanding of God—a God who doesn't care all that much about earthly equality, who told the Israelites not to race-mix, who said the poor are always with us, who proclaimed the husband head of the wife, who ordained Original Sin, who doesn't want mankind trying to bring Heaven to Earth. (Most Christians have abandoned this God in favor of Buddy Christ; the Christian Traditionalists have not.)
In other words, the HBD worldview turns out to be remarkably similar at certain junctions to the ancient Christian worldview, though very different reasons buttress the worldviews. The Christian Traditionalists believe the world is Fallen and awaiting its Savior. The rest of us believe the world is naturally Fallen. And any utopian Leftoid trying to “fix” it wholesale is just gonna make things worse. The Christian Traditionalists believe in gender roles because God said so. The rest of us believe in gender roles because there's a thing called testosterone, and men make more of it, and we're fucking sexually dimorphic hominids for Christ's sake, not fungi.
So, must you accept evolution to be a neoreactionary? Yes. Or perhaps a better way to put it is that you must accept the world as it presents itself, not as we wish it to be. Whether you accept it as the result of “evolution” or of “God's ordained existence” is a philosophical argument that, I hope, will not divide the Derbyshires and the Dalrocks.
*I'm using D'Souza to make a point here, not to frame him as a Cathedral mouthpiece. His books are worth reading, and he makes a lot of good reactionary points. He's a champion of Western Civilization, if nothing else. But, like any mainstream conservative, he just can't take his reaction too far.

Vaibhav, who secured his BE degree with IT specialisation 2011, has been so guilt-ridden that he has not taken up a job yet and has spent all his time chasing university officials to have the degree certificate junked.A Mumbai University student, who claims that he cleared a first-year Bachelor in Engineering (BE) paper by paying Rs 20,000 to an agent, has moved the Bombay High Court seeking directions to the university to revoke his degree.Vaibhav Patil, 26, has approached the court as a last resort after spending three years knocking on every door in the university. But every department either asked him to seek psychiatric help or requested him see an in-house counsellor.Vaibhav, who secured his BE degree with IT specialisation 2011, has been so guilt-ridden that he has not taken up a job yet and has spent all his time chasing university officials to have the degree certificate junked.His single-minded pursuit of setting a wrong he committed in 2009 right led his family at one point to seeking psychiatric treatment for him and he was put on a course of anti-depressants by a doctor in Jalgaon, his home town. Speaking exclusively to Mumbai Mirror on Tuesday on the condition that his picture will not be carried in the paper, Vaibhav said all the pills either went into the bin or were chucked out of the window. “I knew there was nothing wrong with me but I had committed a wrong that had to be set right and that was it,” he said.Vaibhav failed in Maths – II paper in the first year. While he could have cleared the subject the next year, his friends advised him to contact an ‘agent' who would get it done for him. “I was vulnerable. I was in a state of shock after flunking the paper,” Vaibhav recalls.He paid around Rs 20,000 to an agent and managed to clear the subject easily. Though he managed to clear all subjects in the subsequent years fair and clear, the guilt of how he had gotten through the first year stayed. “I always felt that I had cheated my conscience,” said Vaibhav.As soon as he got the degree, he began writing to university authorities, requesting that his degree be quashed. “I wrote to the office of the vice-chancellor, the Students Welfare Department, and every other possible authority but could not get any response. Wherever I went, people asked me to see a psychiatrist or a counsellor and asked me to get rid of the guilt,” he said.In 2014, Vaibhav decided to move the Bombay High Court to get rid of the tainted degree. But here too he faced several hurdles. At least a dozen lawyers refused to take up his case because it looked like a losing proposition to them. Eventually, one lawyer agreed to draft his petition, but that too on the condition of anonymity. The petition was filed in August 2014 and was admitted in September the same year. Its next hearing is due on September 20. In all the hearings that have taken place so far, Vaibhav has represented himself.Admitting that Vaibhav has been in touch with the university with a hitherto unheard of request, M A Khan, registrar, University of Mumbai, said the institute has faced two problems – one, he is not willing to reveal how he cheated; two, the university has no provision to revoke a degree upon a student's request under the Maharashtra Universities Act.“While the act has provisions for the university to cancel a degree if it is found to be fake, there is no provision to take such a step upon a student's request,” said Khan. He, however, said the degree can be revoked if the Academic Council passes a resolution to the effect. But for the Academic Council to do that, Vaibhav will have to produce proof that he did cheat and also reveal how it was done.But Vaibhav is undeterred. “If I reveal the agent's identity a lot of other students may get into trouble. All I want is that students should know what I have been through. I want to send out the message that nothing is worth achieving when you get it through wrong means. I have learnt my lesson and hope that others do too,” he added.
Islamic schools including those funded by the British government and private institutions are forcing children — some of whom are very young — to wear the Islamic Hijab as part of their uniform code.
The garment, which is designed to shield women from the lust of men, is heavily associated with conservative interpretations of the Islamic faith. The revelations over children being forced to wear the shroud at school comes just weeks after Transport for London road safety campaign featuring a child girl in a hijab was criticised and ultimately scrapped for “sexualising four-year-olds”.
The revelation comes from research by the National Secular Society, which has told the education minister that the hijab head covering is a compulsory item of school uniform for girls in 59 schools they are aware of across the United Kingdom, reports The Sunday Times.
Of those 59 schools, eight are state-funded — and three of those are primary schools, serving children as young as four.
Examples of school uniform policy reported by the newspaper lay bare just how prescriptive the rules can be, requiring girls to cover up much more than just their hair. One says “the face must be covered outside the school”, while another stipulates “It is very important that the uniform is loose fitting and modest and that the hijab is fitted closely to the head. The uniform is compulsory.”
Pushing back against the rules, the report by the society submitting the research to the government said: “No child should be obliged to wear the hijab or any other article of religious clothing while at school.”
The revelation follows similar research reported on in early September which found there were potentially thousands of state primary schools which allowed the wearing of the hijab, which campaigners said sexualised the children wearing them.
Education regulator Ofsted is reportedly investigating whether the move to introduce the garment to children all over Britain was driven by schools themselves, or if “there is evidence that schools are facing external pressure”, from parents or religious groups.
Jessica's* family was so close to mine that we spent holidays and vacations together, and my sister and I called her parents our godparents. We'd spent the first 30 years of our lives in happy compatibility, and I assumed it would always be that way.
Jessica was 11 years younger than me. When I got married, she was in my wedding. When it was Jessica to have our babies, we threw baby showers for each other and made sure we always honored the special friendship we'd grown. We were at the hospital for the birth of each other's first babies, lovingly gushing over the newest addition to our new three-generation deep friendship.
Both of our families were over the moon to learn that Jessica was pregnant with her second child — a girl! I already had three young daughters and my sister had one, so we were thrilled to be able to welcome another girl into the mix.
One day I received a text from my sister and all it said was, "did you hear what Jessica is naming her girl?"
"No, what is it?" I responded, feeling excited about the big news.
It turns out Jessica had decided to name her daughter the same name I had chosen for my daughter: Elsie. My daughter's name was very special to me. I had chosen the name for my daughter a long time before I had even conceived her because I had seen it in a special book, and I loved it instantly. I chose this name because it was a very unusual Jewish name (at the time), and I knew no one else would have it (later it became very popular).
My heart sank. Why would she do this? There are so many names to choose from, so why would she choose my special name? And if she wanted my name, why wouldn't she at least ask me if it was OK — out of respect?
I thought about it for a month. I went back and forth about whether I should say something or not. I talked it over with my mom and sister, and we decided it would be totally acceptable to send an email to Jessica sharing some of my feelings.
It was important to me to convey my message in a kind and loving way, so I took my time to compose what I felt to be a well-written email. I told Jessica I was feeling badly that she chose the same name as me, and that I wished she had talked to me about it first. My intention was to share my feelings and get them out in the open so I wouldn't have to endure a lifetime of resentment every time I saw Jessica and her daughter.
Jessica responded hatefully. Her anger toward me was palpable. She heard not a word I said. She understood not a single sentiment of my feelings or opinion on the matter. She took my attempt at "lets communicate about this and move on" and crumpled it up and threw it away.
That was three years ago, and no one has spoken to her since. We invite her to do our annual pumpkin picking and she is busy. We invite to our Christmas Eve celebration, which we've done since we were children. She has other plans.
I've contemplated my email many times over the years. Was it right? Was it wrong? I think, it was just a name, after all, and maybe that was just something I should've let go. But I made the decision to send the email because so many of our gripes with people or situations are left unsaid, inspiring resentment.
I wanted to rise above that and be the person who opens lines of communication. I wanted to send a kind message expressing my feelings. I don't want to keep everything I feel bottled up inside me. I want to let go of regret. I want to let go of resentment.
Shouldn't we all be allowed to express ourselves to our friends and family as long as it is done with kindness and respect?
Because of this, I have lost a friendship and greatly strained a longstanding family connection. I also think, if this friendship ended over a name, surely it couldn't have been a very strong one.
I have thought a lot about friendship and forgiveness since this all happened. I've thought about what it means to be able to love and forgive people for their mistakes — whether those mistakes are temporary lapses in judgment or a fundamental breakdown in what we each deem as right and wrong.
Why is it so easy to remove someone from our lives when they once represented something valuable and irreplaceable?
Sometimes relationships break down over the years. We go our separate ways as we evolve into different people with each turning decade. Now, I recommend we take a deeper look inside ourselves if we're willing to let something go so easily. In my case, maybe it was more than a name.

Norwich prostitute and pimp jailed for robbing driver with rape threat Mark Shields

A prostitute and her husband have been jailed for robbing a young man with the threat of reporting him for a made-up rape.

Karl Skoulding.
Drug addict Sharon Skoulding stood in the middle of the road to flag down the victim's car before getting in and demanding £40 for a heroin fix for her and her husband.
As the pair argued, Karl Skoulding got into the car, threatening the victim with a knuckleduster and showing him a black handle he thought was a knife, before forcing him to drive to a cashpoint to withdraw the money.
At Norwich Crown Court yesterday, Karl Skoulding, 33, of Union Street, was jailed for five years. Sharon Skoulding, 41, of Trory Street, was sentenced to four years.
Both had denied robbery but were found guilty at trial.
Judge Peter Jacobs said the pair had resorted “to Plan B” after Sharon Skoulding had tried to prostitute herself for drug money on the afternoon of November 6 last year.
When that failed, she stopped the victim's car in daylight in a side street off Ber Street, telling him unless he handed the money over she would report him for a fictional rape.
Judge Jacobs said: “You said to him: ‘Do as I say or I will say you raped me.' Those are the sorts of words that would strike a chill into anybody.”
She said she would call her Polish partner if he didn't pay up, at which point her pimp Karl Skoulding appeared, faking a foreign accent.
With Karl Skoulding holding an object to the victim's side, they drove to Sainsbury's on Queen's Road, where the victim withdrew cash. He asked for help from another customer but, with the two still in the vehicle, “he was in an impossible situation”, said Judge Jacobs, and had been “effectively abducted in his own car”.
Lori Tucker, mitigating for Sharon Skoulding, said there were no aggravating features of violence or injury, adding her client had been making progress in prison as she tried to get clean of drink and drugs.
John Farmer, for Karl Skoulding, said the incident had been “a short-lived episode with no actual violence”.
Det Sgt Richard Dickinson, of Norwich CID, said: “This was a very traumatic experience for the victim involved and I would like to thank him for his courage in coming forward.”
Another one of Bill O'Reilly's former colleagues at CBS News is casting doubt on his claims that he reported from a "combat situation" in Buenos Aires during the Falklands War.
Charles Krause, a CBS News correspondent from 1980 to 1983 who reported from Buenos Aires during the same period as O'Reilly, is the latest to contradict the Fox News host. In an interview with Media Matters, Krause called O'Reilly's descriptions of his reporting "absurd."
He also recalls O'Reilly being there for a short period of time and not having "any significant role in our coverage of the war."
"I don't recall him doing any major story that anybody remembers and he was there a very short time, then he was recalled, I don't know why," Krause said. "He wasn't a team player and people thought he was grandstanding, basically."
O'Reilly's past claims about his 1982 reporting from the region have come under scrutiny following a Mother Jones investigation that found while O'Reilly has suggested that he actually reported from the Falklands during the war, no CBS reporter had done so.
O'Reilly responded with claims he had never said he was in the Falklands, but stood by his assertions that he had been in Buenos Aires and covered what he termed a "war zone" and "combat situation."
CNN's Brian Stelter on Sunday reported that seven of O'Reilly's former colleagues who reported from Buenos Aires refuted his claims. Media Matters has identified several additional instances in which O'Reilly suggested his reporting had been from a combat zone.
Krause, a former Washington Post reporter who had lived in Buenos Aires for three years prior to the war, said O'Reilly's claims are wrong.
"That's absurd because Buenos Aires was Buenos Aires," Krause said about the war zone claim in an interview Sunday. "It was just like it always was, there was very little evidence of the war in Buenos Aires. The war was being fought thousands of miles away."
Krause joined several of the journalists quoted by Stelter in casting doubt on O'Reilly's claim that he had witnessed a violent protest in which several demonstrators had been killed. "There's a difference between demonstrations and rioting," Krause said. "I don't recall there being rioting, there could have been scuffling."
Krause said he was one of the first reporters there covering the conflict and stayed through the end of hostilities.
The story of the shutdown is, in large part, the story of mainstream Republicans realizing they can't control tea party Republicans -- and deciding that it's better to go along than to try and fight. Christopher Parker, a political scientist at the University of Washington, is co-author of the book "Change They Can't Believe In: The Tea Party and Reactionary Politics in America", which employs large surveys and content analyses to better understand how the politics of the tea party differ from the politics of the Republican Party. We spoke on Wednesday, and a transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows.
Seems true. (Julie Jacobson - Associated Press)
Ezra Klein: Tell me a bit about the scope of your research on the tea party.
Christopher Parker: So I run a survey research lab at the University of Washington. In 2010, I began to see these opposing views on the tea party. You had Peggy Noonan and Juan Williams basically saying, the tea partiers are just angry Republicans, no big deal. Then I read Frank Rich, and he says no, these people are completely different. He says they're more in line with Richard Hofstadter's "Paranoid Style of American Politics." And I thought, I can get real data on this! And when I looked at it empirically, I found that people who supported the tea party tended to be more racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, and anti-Obama.
EK: So I'm not exactly a tea partier myself. But when I hear you say that I bristle. The description members of the tea party would give of themselves is that they're really concerned about the growth of government and the rise in taxes and the management of the economy. Labeling them things like racist, sexist and homophobic sounds like an attempt to just write them out of civilized discourse. So persuade me that this isn't just an attack.
CP: What I do in these surveys and models is I account for desire for limited government. I account for ideology. I account for all these other things where people could say they're just more conservative. There's just this empirical connection between support for the tea party and antagonistic views toward quote-unquote marginalized groups, or, if you prefer, toward quote-unquote not real Americans. If you look at the historical and social scientific literature on American national identity, the portrait that emerges is mainly white, male, middle class, straight, at least a bit educated, and a bit older.
Look at who rose during this period. It's not all about Obama. Nancy Pelosi was the first female speaker of the House. Barney Frank wielded real power. Two women, one of whom was a Latina, went to the Supreme Court. Undocumented workers have gotten a ton of attention. There's been the rise of same-sex rights.
That's the crux of the book. The title is ‘Change They Can't Believe In'. This isn't new. Whenever there's rapid social change it triggers this kind reactionary conservatism. People see their social prestige threatened, their way of life threatened. And they react.
EK: Tell me about the surveys. Who are you talking to?
CP: The data set is collected in 13 states, 10 of which were battleground states in 2010. We drew the data in 2011. That's the survey data. We also have a content analysis where we look at the content of 42 tea party Web sites in 15 states, and we compare it with the content of the National Review Online. And it couldn't be more different. If you look at core postwar conservative principles, it tends to be around the size of government, then you also have national security conservative and social conservatives. And that can be an uneasy fit between the limited government and social conservative types. What brings them together is the threat of communism.
So if you look at this postwar discourse in the National Review Online you have some content about limited government, some about social conservatism, and some about national security. That content accounts for 76 percent of that National Review online. Now if you look at the Tea Party Web sites, that only accounts for 30 percent. Then there's this conspiratorial discourse Hofstadter talks about that says government is really trying to bring about socialism, etc. That's only about five percent of what you find at the National Review. On tea party Web sites it's about a third.
So it's not just that we're seeing results like 76 percent of tea partiers want to see Obama fail. We also ask if people think Obama is destroying the country. We asked this question of all self-identified conservatives. If you look at all conservatives, 35 percent believe that. If you look at tea party conservatives and non-tea party conservatives, only six percent of non-tea party conservatives believe that vs. 71 percent of tea party conservatives.
So to draw this together, the reason people should believe us is we have disparate data sources that collapse on the same answer. It's that these people are not the traditional, mainstream conventional conservatives. If you look at tea party conservatives, or as we call them in the book, reactionary conservatives, they don't want change at all. They want to go back in time.
EK: But if you ask them, they wouldn't say something like “I want to go back in time” or “all change is bad.” Again, that's now how they see themselves. So what are they saying to you that's leading you to these conclusions?
CP: Bear with me for a moment I'm going to read you some quotes from our interviews in the field. We interviewed true believers and skeptics and every one in between. So let me give you an example of a real tea party supporter's explanation of Obama,.
“I think he comes from a very socialist-Marxist background. I think it's absolutely the way he leads. I think he wants to micromanage individuals as an elitist, looking down, trying to make people do what he thinks they should be doing. And I think that's very close to tyranny and I think that's very wrong.”
And one other example. One tea party supporter went further, calling him “an enemy of the state. A freaking communist.” So let me be clear. I'm not saying all tea partiers are like this. It's not a categorical assessment, It's probabilistic. If you have one person who loves the tea party and one who hates the tea party the probability is the one who loves the tea party will be more like this. But people don't fully appreciate how committed the tea party is to not compromising and not capitulating.
EK: And how big is the tea party?
CP: What we do is we use support for the tea party as a proxy for reactionary conservatives. During the time of this survey about 22 percent of the country strongly supports the tea party.
EK: That's still not that large. So why do they have such success driving outcomes?
CP: Because they won't compromise. You've got about 52 members of the Republican conference who are affiliated with the tea party in some official way. That's a bit less than a quarter of all House Republicans. That's enough in the House. They refuse to compromise because, to them, compromise is capitulation. If you go back to Hofstadter's work when he's talking about when the John Birch Society rode high, he talks about how conservatives would see people who disagree as political opponents, but reactionary conservatives saw them as evil. You can't capitulate to evil.
Brave New World
Hey folks,
This week we have been busy cracking away on the campaign and at all the areas of the game still awaiting polish. In this edition of WFTO Wednesday we'll be talking a little about Saturday's livestream and having a small highlight into the ongoing development of sounds.
Livestream Recap
On Saturday four members of our development team participated in a three hour long livestream, placed completely at your mercy we were bombarded with your questions and we made sure to answer as many of these as possible while still showing off a whole bunch of new things.
We covered a whole bunch of topics during the livestream including:
Our plans running up to release
Unit Sounds & More Sounds in other areas of the game
Plans post-release
Support for community-created content
and more!
If you missed the livestream then you can catch the video on demand over on Youtube and embedded just below! It's a fairly long one so be sure you have plenty of time!
Game Sounds
Over the past few weeks we have been asked where development stands regarding sounds as not many are currently implemented on the public branch. We're pleased to report that we actually have a huge collection of audio assets awaiting implementation into the game and we expect that most of these will be headed in for 0.7.0.
The integration of Audio assets has always fallen by the wayside as we've focused on developing and implementing new features, it's within these last few weeks prior to release that we'll finally be hooking them all in! This short video demonstrates some of the new sound hooks for units using a few of our placeholder sounds.
We still have a few more sounds to finish up alongside new VFX and we're to start recording individual lines for our units extremely soon, every unit's personality will shine through in their audio, we can't wait for you to hear them!
Campaign Preview
The campaign rolls ever forward and with it the realm of Kairos is finally taking shape, as per our covenant we are pleased to present another very special preview of the campaign this week.
Below you can see an almost final piece of concept art for the campaign map, in the release version this map will be a 3D model seen through a looking glass, this looking glass will enable us to easily expand the game with more campaigns in the future.
Your conquests in the realm of Kairos will be reflected as your forces swarm and scorch the surface of the overworld! Chart your progress and the course of the war on the map and witness the fall of an Empire as you bring it to it's knees!
That about wraps it up for this week, be sure to drop by next Wednesday for news on some long awaited changes!
Until next time Underlord,
– WFTO Team

We've had this question asked a few times recently and decided to investigate it. Which method of driving is more efficient; driving with your windows down and AC off or driving with your windows up and AC on? Today we find out.
Simple Engine Operation
The battery in your car is a rechargeable battery. When you turn the key in your car to start the engine, the battery uses some of its charge to turn the engine over. It's very similar to a pull starter on a lawnmower, the only difference is, a car's starter is automated by an electric motor. In fact, some of the first cars had something much like a lawnmower's pull starter – a crank in the front that one would turn that help get things going.
Once the engine starts, it's self-sustaining (as long as there is fuel) thanks to the combustion taking place inside the engine. While the engine is running, the alternator in the car (a small electrical generator) will recharge the battery using some of the power produced by the engine.
If your battery dies thanks to leaving your lights on all night, the electronic motor in the car will not be able to turn the car over and it won't start up. However, if you were to roll the car down a hill while it's in gear, the wheels turning will force the pistons to move and the car will start. Once started, the alternator will be able to recharge the dead battery.
Air-Conditioner Operation
When you turn the AC on in your car, it uses energy supplied to it by the alternator. This energy is coming from the engine, which is using the fuel in your gas tank. The AC won't run properly without the car started because the belt that engages the compressor (which is used to compress the coolant and make it cold) will only run with the engine started. This is the same belt that is responsible for running the alternator and charging your battery.
Which Are More Efficient, Windows Down Or A/C On?
Testing the effect of both methods (windows down, AC off versus windows up and AC on) has been done and debated by several different organizations. One of the leading groups, the Society of Automotive Engineers, conducted a number of tests on the effects of AC versus windows rolled down on automobiles.
The SAE found that running an air conditioner in an automobile decreased gas mileage by 5 to 10%. Stanford University and SAE both recommend driving with your car's windows down if you are traveling on city streets. However, when on a freeway or highway, the drag produced by your windows being rolled down exceeds the efficiency drop by keeping windows rolled up and AC on. Both organizations recommend that you use your car's AC when driving at speeds above 45 MPH.
With that in mind, it's probably best to do your driving in the early morning or later at night when possible. This is when the day is (usually) cooler. Driving with the A/C off and windows up is the most fuel efficient way to operate your automobile.
Due to press not being allowed into the venue on the first two days of IEM Katowice, we are severely limited in terms of capturing footage at the event in Poland.
Unfortunately, when we arrived at the venue, we were told that press isn't allowed to enter the venue on the first two days of competition.
That means we won't be able to get any footage from the entire group stage, which is reserved for the first two days before the playoffs move on to the Spodek arena's main stage from Friday on.
The tournament area is situated somewhere behind this wall
We will still try to get in touch with some of the teams from group B today to at least give you some pre-interviews, and grab group A teams to interview them about their results at their hotel at the end of the day, or tomorrow.
Stay tuned to HLTV.org as we will still provide you with as much as we are able to, including hot matches, statistics, rundowns of group results and possibly interviews.
Also make sure to follow @HLTVorg on Twitter, where we will be updating you with happenings at IEM Katowice.
Whether you're using SharePoint for your next Intranet or building Team Sites to collaborate on documents, one request has always stayed and that's the Corporate Directory. A people company phone book if you will, to quickly find someone using whatever filter you want. SharePoint 2010 had introduced some kind of org chart to help us with that as well as the Profiles and it has stayed almost unchanged in SharePoint 2013.
This article will look at building our own corporate directory with SharePoint Search and Display Templates.
A big thanks to Stacy Deere-Strole from Focal Point Solutions for her hard work with the Display Template and allowing me to write this post today. You'll find the downloadable file at the end of this article.
Making Sure the People Properties Are Available and Searchable
Before you start even thinking about the people directory and how you're going to build the SharePoint Display Template for it, you have to make sure you know what properties you'll want to see and use.
Here's a common list of properties though not listed in any particular order or with their actual Managed Property names.
Name
Department
Email
Phone
Location
Job Title
Picture
You want to think of all the properties you'd like to show or allow users to filter and search by. Then, figure out how these properties are going to have values in them. Is it up to the user to edit his or her profile or will it be imported from Active Directory or some other source?
Once you figured out what the properties are going to be and how their values are entered or collected the next step is the most important one, making them searchable.
I've already written a few articles on using SharePoint Search to build things in SharePoint and it always comes down to the same thing, Managed Properties. If you want to display or refine by properties you have on people profiles or on documents, you need to make sure they're available as Managed Properties.
Before you continue on with this article, make sure you understand what Crawled Properties and Managed Properties for SharePoint are.
Building the SharePoint Search Page for the Corporate Directory
We've thought about what will be displayed and how we're going to allow visitors to filter, so now we need to prepare the page for this SharePoint corporate directory.
The choice is yours. We're going to need a page with the Search Box, Refinement and Search Results Web Part to do this.
What we're building is a Search Driven page in SharePoint, so if you want to have some fun with this, you can add the Content Search or more Search Results Web Parts on the page to enhance the experience.
For now, I'm going to keep it simple and use the Search Web Parts shown in the screenshot above, which should give you the following. But feel free to place them where you want, you can also use whatever Site Template you want. I took the Enterprise Search Center template and created a new Site Collection. I then went to set the People Results page to the Site's homepage.
This is the page you should see and, if you want, can set as the homepage.
I removed the Search Navigation as I don't actually want this to be a Search Center, but rather my People Directory however, it's completely up to you.
Now that we have the page set up, we'll need to make sure that it's set up to show all users by default when we navigate to the page. To do this, you'll need to edit the People Search Core Results Web Part and click on Change Query. This will bring up the Query Builder window and there, we'll make sure that it's set up to show People Results by default.
You can easily do this by adding contentclass=SPSPeople to the query text of this Search Results Web Part, but you'll want to leave the {searchboxquery} so that the results will filter based on what's entered in the Search Box.
Once this is done, you'll already see all the people profiles show up as search results and the refinement panel already working for you with the default properties. Feel free to edit the Refinement Web Part to add the properties you wish to filter by.
If you don't see a Managed Property you wanted to filter by, make sure that it's set to Refinable in the Search Schema.
At this point, you have a very basic people directory and all that's needed now is a little branding. Whenever we speak of branding the Search Results in SharePoint, we're talking about Display Templates.
Creating the SharePoint Display Template for Your Corporate Directory
This is the more complicated part! It's relatively easy to create user profile properties and assign them to Managed Properties and even easier to set your Search Results to show People when you land on the page. But making the results look the way you want them to, that's another story.
Luckily, the Display Template is ready for you to download at the end of this article. However, it's always good to go through it and try to understand what's going on to make necessary adjustments if needed.
What Is a Display Template Again?
Good question! Basically, it's a way of creating an HTML design for your Search Results. It's called a template because it's completely reusable. You create it once and every item that comes out of the search results uses it to place its properties in the allocated spot in your design. So here, we're creating an HTML design so that the properties we want of a person, like their name and picture as well as department, looks the way we want and is repeated to all results.
Here's an example on how I would usually add the Title Managed Property of an item as part of a span in my HTML design.
The thing is, if you want Hit Highlighting (for the word that the person searched for to be highlighted in bold) it's completely different. You need to use a different method and this is what was used in the Display Template.
Note the use of: Srch.U.getSingleHHXMLNodeValue(hhProps, "department")
Adding New Properties in the Display Template
First, you'll need to make sure that the Managed Property you'd like to use is declared at the beginning of the Display Template file in the head tag under ManagedPropertyMapping.
Then, you'll need to copy one of the lines used, say for the Department Field above, and use it for this new property.
As for branding, well that's the CSS file.

The Alphabets file is an HTML file that adds the letters to help quickly filter the Search Results shown. Add it wherever you want and add a Content Editor Web Part on the page and change the properties to link to the HTML file. Here is the result.
Let me know how it goes in the comments below!
As I have been preparing some Unreal Engine 4 C++ tutorials, I wanted to use the Built-in C++ FPS Template that ships with the engine as a base project and found it has VR and Touch input code in the character class which don't server any purpose unless you are interested in VR and/or mobile. Since I needed a super simple C++ template to not scare people away from learning this language, I decided to create a simplified version with only the essentials for non-VR projects (That's what you have the VR Template for these days) and make it available to all on GitHub.
To give you an idea of the changes I made, the Character class is about 1/3 the size in code compared to the built-in FPS Template with the same functionality and several unnecessary coding concepts stripped out (such as a few UPROPERTY meta keywords you don't need to know exist as a newbie). The purpose of all this is to make it less intimidating to start using C++ with UE4.

CLEVELAND, Ohio - Attorneys for Jimmy Dimora say they are reviewing closely a U.S. Supreme Court decision Monday that mirrors issues brought up in the former county commissioner's 2012 trial.
The ruling overturned former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell's public corruption conviction. It also offered key similarities with Dimora's public corruption trial. The decision limited the way federal prosecutors can bring public corruption cases to trial.
It is unclear whether Dimora can get a legal reprieve based on McDonnell's case, but his attorneys said they will study their options.
The ruling focused on whether an officeholder's typical daily duties, or official acts -- such as setting up meetings for constituents, talking to another official about a friend or making a speech -- can be interpreted as criminal. The court ruled those duties usually are not criminal, even in the case of an official accepting gifts or money from the person seeking the favors.
Chief Justice John Roberts noted that federal law prohibits "quid pro quo,'' a legal term that means a public official receives something of value in exchange for some type of favorable work. But Roberts said that push can be overly broad.
"In the Government's view, nearly anything a public official accepts - from a campaign contribution to lunch - counts as a quid,'' Roberts wrote. "And nearly anything that a public official does - from arranging a meeting to inviting a guest to an event - counts as a quo.''
In McDonnell's case, according to court records, there were five such acts, including hosting events for a key contributor, arranging meetings with other Virginia officials and contacting officials about the contributor. A jury convicted McDonnell, and he was sentenced to two years in prison. He accepted tens of thousands of dollars in gifts from a Virginia businessman.
William Whitaker, who represented Dimora, said the similarities in the cases were clear. They had claimed at trial that Dimora was simply doing his job as a commissioner and that just because Dimora set up a meeting for a contractor or talked with an official from another department about the businessman did not mean those acts were criminal.
"We felt the statute was overbroad, and it sweeps innocent conduct withins its orbit,'' Whitaker said. "The jury was instructed on the overbroad definition of 'official acts,' permitting it to convict based on innocent conduct.''
Christian Grostic, an attorney who handled Dimora's appeals, said the cases of McDonnell and Dimora were quite similar, but he stopped short of saying what the Supreme Court's decision could mean for the former commissioner.
Federal prosecutors in Cleveland said in a statement that they are reviewing the opinion: "If any litigation ensues as a result of the opinion, we will respond.''
Dimora, 61, is serving a 28-year term for racketeering and 30 other corruption-related charges at a medium-security federal prison in Beckley, W.Va.
Prosecutors accused Dimora of accepting more than 100 bribes and attempting to fix eight court cases. They also accused him of employing six contractors at his home in Independence to build a resort-style backyard patio and pool house for free or at greatly discounted prices.
Dimora has exhausted his appeals, as appellate courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have upheld his conviction. But federal law could offer him one last exception, based on the ruling Monday.
Carl Tobias, a constitutional professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said Monday's ruling will make it harder for federal prosecutors to take some public corruption cases to trial. But that doesn't mean bribery cases will come to an end.
"It does narrow federal prosecutors' flexibility, though,'' Tobias said.
Others agreed.
"It will limit the breadth of the authority, but it will not eliminate the Justice Department's capacity to root out federal, state and local corruption,'' said Geoffrey Mearns, the president of Northern Kentucky University and the former dean of the Cleveland Marshall College of Law at Cleveland State University. He also had worked as a federal prosecutor.
In his ruling, Roberts stressed that the McDonnell case involved limiting that flexibility.
"But our concern is not with the tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes and ball gowns,'' Roberts wrote. "It is instead with the broader legal implications of the Government's boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute.
"A more limited interpretation of the term 'official act' leaves ample room for prosecuting corruption, while comporting with the text of the statute and the precedent of this Court.''
Amid Ethics Office Debacle, Googling Congress Members Spiked. Sort Of
Amid this week's firestorm over Republicans' attempt to weaken the Office of Congressional Ethics (and subsequently, backpedal on that attempt), you may have seen this chart floating around the Internet. It depicts data from Google Trends about Americans' search interest in learning who their congressional representatives are, with a pronounced spike around 9 a.m. Tuesday.
The Hill reported this on Tuesday, with the The New York Times later referencing the trend. The conclusion some are drawing is that people looked up their representatives, then called them to complain about the ethics issue, and that the groundswell of support got Congress members' attention. And, indeed, some Congress members reported that these phone calls did influence them.
But there's a buyer-beware issue with this data, and with all Google Trends data — the problem of scale. While there's a "spike" here, there's no way to tell how big it is without comparing it to other popular — or unpopular — search terms. Depending on what you're comparing it to, that spike is little more than a speed bump.
Here, for example, is the "who is my representative" search compared to searches for "Obamacare" in the U.S. over the past week.
The spike nearly disappears here — as of 9 a.m. Tuesday, "who is my representative" registered at 7 on this chart, compared to 60 for Obamacare.
But then, maybe that's not fair. Obamacare is a really big topic in the news right now. Let's try a Google search term that's still politics-related but with less mass appeal, like infrastructure.
The Congress-member-search spike is a bit more apparent here, but it's still dwarfed even by searches for the relatively nonsexy topic of infrastructure.
The really striking comparisons come when you compare this "spike" to searches for nonpolitics-related topics. How about a newly released, poorly reviewed movie?
What about a certain pop superstar who recently gave a catastrophic performance on national TV?
OK, so the spike for Mariah Carey happened a couple of days earlier, but you get the picture. It's true that Google Trends data can say something about what people care about, and that can be super-useful in a democracy where politicians are theoretically supposed to represent those cares. For example, researchers reported in October that Trump searches outstripped Hillary Clinton searches. They subsequently concluded that "this could be evidence that Mr. Trump is doing better than the polls project."
But when that data is presented without a reference point, it can overstate the importance of a particular search trend. In fact, to get a term that has comparable volume to the Congress member search, you have to get creative and do a lot of random Googling. As it turns out, searches for "who is my representative" are roughly equal to searches for a 1990s trend that people have mostly forgotten.
So searches for "who is my representative" spiked, surpassing Beanie Baby searches for the first time in ... well, a long time.
None of this is to say that this spike didn't matter; lots more people than usual did Google their Congress members' offices, and anecdotal evidence suggests that there was an increase in people calling their Congress members.
But it is to say that Google data on only one search term can misrepresent the size of a phenomenon. Yes, plenty of people were Googling their Congress members this week. But plenty more were watching that Mariah video.
After many years building their skills producing award winning short films, Pixar quietly slipped Toy Story [IMDB] onto the big screens in 1995. Initially a curiosity – it was the first feature-length computer animated film – it quickly won over audiences and critics. The movie became an instant classic and established Pixar as a force to be reckoned with.
This initial success was short lived. It was replaced by mind-numbing, Earth-shattering success. Their 16 feature films have earned 12 Oscars and over four billion dollars in ticket sales (and that's not counting the billions more in home media, partnerships and merchandising). No studio in history has enjoyed such a consistent record over such a long period of time.
Not every outing has resulted in a classic. Cars 2 [IMDB], for example, suffered lukewarm appraisals from critics even as it went on to best the box office totals of the original. Yet the rule remained: even the worst Pixar movie was still pretty damn good.
Due to various creative shake-ups, Pixar's planned 2014 release, The Good Dinosaur, was pushed back to late 2015, just a few months after their summer 2015 release, Inside Out. I recently saw both of them within a few days of one another.
(There will be a few, minor spoilers ahead.)
Motivations Matter
Inside Out is the story of a young girl, Riley, who has been uprooted and moved across the country. We experience her struggle internally, via personifications of her basic emotions and the metaphorical mental edifices they construct. Everything Riley loves has been changed and her struggle to accept those changes is a story that the audience can intimately empathize with.
Her goals, like in all of Pixar's best movies, are simple and universally understandable. She was happy and is now sad. She wants desperately to be happy again, but doesn't know how. How she achieves her goals may be complex and unexpected, but what she wants is clear from the start and never changes.
In The Last Dinosaur, Arlo is a young dinosaur. He's the smallest and least capable of his family of farmers. He wants to make “his mark” and prove himself by doing something important for his family. Instead, through various misadventures, he ends up far from home and befriending a young, less evolved, human, that he names “Spot”. Together, they struggle to get home.
Arlo has many goals and how he'll achieve them are unclear. They also change as the movie progresses, further confusing the audience. Arlo wants to help his family, but doesn't pursue any specific way of doing so. He wants to make his father proud and overcome his fears, but this is done almost by accident rather than any directed plan. He (eventually) also wants to care for Spot, yet doing so is unrelated to either his family or his fear.
Character Matters
Inside Out features the brightly colored, smoothly animated characters and gorgeous, but stylized environments that scream “Pixar!” The visuals are richly textured and lit, but simplified and, especially the metaphorical emotions, cartoonish. The characters and environments support one another completely such that you never question them. If this is what the world looks like, then this is naturally what a person in it would look like!
In The Good Dinosaur the visuals are at odds with one another. There are shots of the environment in this film that you'd swear were filmed from life. They're that good… and totally incongruent with the multiple character designs. The human caveboy, Spot, is the most “Pixar-like” of the characters. His wide eyes, flexible brows and mouth are expressly designed to convey emotion. Many of the other creatures have a similar super-deformed, yet realistic style.
In contrast, Arlo the dinosaur feels more like classic Tex Avery theatrical animation. Smooth and more simply textured, he has a gangly, boneless elasticity that favors physical emotion and slap-stick more than subtlety. While expertly designed and animated, he simply doesn't seem to fit with his environment or many of the other characters.
Furthermore, the character of Spot is just… weird. He's a human, but given all of the traits and behaviors of dog. The story explains this, badly, by explaining that the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs missed, leaving them as the dominant (but bizarrely, physically unchanged) life on Earth. Still, Spot is a dog. He never evolves past it. The movie never introduces the obvious idea of intelligent humans and intelligent dinosaurs working together. Arlo is played as a boy (with scales), Spot as a dog (opposable thumbs). Period.
Both films have a strong voice cast, but it's difficult not to give a nod to Inside Out's masterful casting of its iconic emotions. Could anybody personify Joy as well as Amy Poehler [IMDB] or, most especially, Anger as well as Lewis Black [IMDB]? The Good Dinosaur's casting choices seem less inspired and more… gimmicked, perhaps? Sam Elliott [IMDB] playing a grizzled cowboy seems more than a little on the nose, doesn't it?
Tone Matters
Pixar has never shied away from tackling darker themes. Children's emotions may be wildly changeable, but they're no less deeply felt. The best movies give them the opportunity to experience more than simple laughter and build suspense, dread and sadness. Most importantly, they layer these emotions in realistic ways. Life is complicated and, often, more bittersweet than sweet.
Inside Out, featuring a cast of core emotions, may have an unfair advantage here. The story of a child's Joy struggling vainly to distract it from deep, encroaching Sadness may be less than subtle. It's also incredibly powerful. Children are validated by seeing that even their negative feelings are natural and important. Adults may long for a simpler time when they could experience their emotions more fully and more openly. Parents will ponder the vast power they wield over their children's happiness.
The Last Dinosaur continues to suffer an identity crisis. Its darkest moments are undeniably meaningful, but also so overplayed and cliched that the intended impact is greatly tempered. More importantly, the darkest moments don't lead to purposeful change, for good or ill. The major events in the film are all the result of increasingly unlikely coincidence. Just how many flash floods could happen on the same river in the space of a few months?
The characters lack agency where agency would most define them. Arlo's adventure seems to be on a rail. Only rarely is he offered the opportunity to make a real, meaningful choice. Spot, and every other character, for that matter, never grow at all. They all move through the story, untouched by it.
In the best Pixar films characters grow mutually to understand each other. All of the Incredibles mature tremendously during their adventures. Marlin doesn't just rescue Nemo, Nemo also rescues himself. WALL-E expands his horizons, but EVE's as well. Arlo does change for the better, however haphazardly, but makes almost no impact in doing so.
More drastically, The Good Dinosaur features several scenes that are shockingly out of place for a Pixar film. Ham-fisted, amateurish attempts to engender fear, mirth or some other emotion that not only fail in their immediate goals, but detract from the rest of the movie as well. In one of the more innocent examples, Arlo and Spot eat spoiled berries and have drug-induced hallucinations for no reason whatsoever. In the most drastic example, we see a cute, wide-eyed little animal who is instantly eaten by a crazed dinosaur… which leads to a short, but brutal, fight for the rest of the… meat.
Pixar has featured similar themes before. The evil Hopper, from A Bug's Life, was fed to baby birds and Linguini from Ratatouille spent a scene drunk. That events like this are incredibly rare should be an indication of how powerful they are, yet The Good Dinosaur uses them as throw-away gags. It feels more like the quick-cut world of classic animation shorts, where terrible things would happen regularly, but were masked by fast action, loud music and a purposeful decision to ignore consequences.
Story Matters
Quality, emotionally-rich storytelling has always been a hallmark of Pixar. Many studios make visually breathtaking animation that fails to make meaningful emotional connections with the audience. Pixar always ground themselves with a clear, universally-understandable goal, first and foremost.
Some fundamental love informs every major action. Marlen must find Nemo; every one of his actions are born of his love for his family. Remy has to cook, even if it puts his little rat-butt in mortal danger. Woody can't disappoint Andy, even if it means helping a rival. Mr. Incredible has to be strong for those around him. Carl Fredricksen has to honor the memory of his wife, even if he misunderstands how at first.
Inside Out's rich metaphorical world mirrors Riley's more mundane, but not less important, real world. Her mental “Hockey Island” may be fantastical, but the love it represents is absolutely clear. Riley herself is confused and unsure how to process her feelings. but her emotional stand-in, Joy isn't. Joy's dedication to maintaining the happy status quo may be ultimately misguided and immature, yet it's a struggle everybody can empathize with.
Arlo's story is more scattered and without singular drive. He's tossed on the wind (both metaphorically and physically) and has trouble focusing on his many goals. Surprisingly, this might make Arlo the more realistic protagonist, but it also makes him an ultimately unsatisfying one.
Endings Matter
Spoilers aside, it's no suprise that Pixar films tend to end happily. Challenges are met, villains are defeated and goals are accomplished. Because of their struggles, the characters have new friends, better circumstances or, at the very least, move forward with a better understanding of one another.
Inside Out continues this tradition. Riley's confused emotions come to respect and rely on one another. The relationship between Riley and her parents matures painfully, as it must, into something stronger than it was. The Last Dinosaur, in continuing contrast, fails to address the core issues it began with. It is a happy ending, superficially at any rate, yet one that remains unsatisfying because the struggle resulted in so little meaningful change.
The close release dates may be responsible for exaggerating the differences between the two films, but it remains difficult to imagine two family films more fundamentally different from one another.
Inside Out is a quintessential Pixar movie from start to finish and is, in fact, one of their strongest films in years. The Last Dinosaur is a muddle, albeit gorgeous, mess. It's not a terrible film and the rule that even the worst Pixar films are still pretty good remains true. It simply doesn't feel like a Pixar movie at all.
Potency: A Widely Misunderstood Concept
A study by Dr Zerrin Atakan and Prof Philip McGuire from 2009 threw some light on the way cannabis actually works by looking at the effects of THC and CBD – the two principal components of cannabis.
The fact that there are two major active components has meant the nature of cannabis has been seriously misrepresented and therefore misunderstood for years, originally through ignorance but more recently deliberately.
For just about all other drugs of intoxication (or enlightenment depending on how you look at these things) there's really only one consideration: How much of the drug you take, i.e. the dose. Strong drugs simply give you more of the drug per gram, pint or whatever unit the drug is measured in. In other words, drugs generally consist of an active compound contained within a larger volume of something else which can be considered neutral.
Hence we have a very simple variable to talk about which we call “strength”. Even if they don't really understand how it works, most people are familiar enough with this concept as it applies to booze and understand that a beer with a 3% ABV is a lot weaker than a beer with 10% ABV, even if they don't know what a “% ABV” actually means*. Most people know something else about “strength” as well, which is that you don't need as much of the strong stuff as you do the weak, but have enough of the weak stuff and you end up in the same place as you do with the strong stuff more or less.
Hence we have a simple variable called “strength” which is widely understood and is nice and easy. This concept extends way beyond booze to include all the naughty drugs – cocaine, ecstasy, heroin, you name it the same logic applies, “stronger” means “higher dose” per gulp/snort/fix.
But when we come to consider cannabis we find things are measured differently and we find a new word is used: “potency”. Whenever governments or their agencies start using a subtly different term for something you think you understand it's always a good idea to ask why?
The Home Office study into cannabis potency of 2008 (PDF read it here) had a go at defining this “potency” concept. The definition the study gave was:
The potency of cannabis is defined as the concentration (%) of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
Sadly it didn't specify what the concentration is a percentage of, giving the misleading impression perhaps that a sample of herbal cannabis consists of upwards of 40% THC. Now, this is clearly not the case as a sample of herbal plant material plainly doesn't consist of nearly half THC, either by volume or by weight. No matter how strong the cannabis is, most of it is clearly plant material. Indeed, it's pretty obvious that it doesn't even consist of 5% THC by weight or volume because that would still be a huge amount of what is a very powerful psychoactive drug. So it's clear that “potency” isn't anything like the same simple concept as strength.
Actually the % THC figure is the proportion of THC in the oils produced by the plant. The plant oozes oils – the pure resin – from glands known as “trichomes”. It's these tiny beads of oil which contain the active chemicals that make cannabis what it is and the “potency” figure often quoted is the proportion of this oil which is THC.
Two important points flow from this:
1: Potency is not strength. Clearly you could have a sample of cannabis with very few globs of resin on, which would make it quite weak, although the resin it did contain could be high in THC, making it a high potency. Likewise a concentrated form of low potency cannabis could deliver a large dose of THC, making it quite strong. One “concentrated form of cannabis” is known as hashish, being the resin of the plant with far less vegetable matter included.
2: The THC is expressed as a percentage (by weight actually) of the oils, there are clearly other substances in the oil, quite a few of which are psycho active but it turns out that one in particular, known as CBD or cannabidiol, is very important when it comes to understanding just what cannabis does to the user.
Spurred on by the Reefer Madness V2 scare of the last decade there were two “Cannabis and Mental Health” conferences held in London in 2004 and 2007 and one of the more interesting presentations (for me) came from Dr Zerrin Atakan who was involved in a study which reported in 2009 called “Distinct Effects of Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol and Cannabidiol” on Neural Activation During Emotional Processing”. The study undertaken by Zerrin Atakan and Professor Philip McGuire consisted of giving subjects a dose of THC or CBD or a placebo and examining the effects on the subject by both a series of standard tests and also by magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (here). Professor Philip McGuire stated
“These studies show that THC and CBD have distinct effects on brain function in humans, and these may underlie their correspondingly different effects on cognition and psychiatric symptoms. Determining how the constituents of cannabis act on the brain is fundamental to understanding the role of cannabis use in the aetiology of psychiatric disorders.”
In English this means understanding the combined roles of THC and CBD is important for understanding how cannabis works and what its effect on the brain will be; it isn't just about THC,
The really interesting thing about this is that CBD turns out to be playing a significant role, yet until recently it had never been routinely measured. It's almost the polar opposite of THC in its effects in some respects; if THC is linked to psychotic type episodes, CBD has anti psychotic properties. If THC is thought to cause panic attacks, CBD calms those impulses. Put in terms the Daily Mail could understand, if THC is “bad”, CBD is “good”.
The practical upshot of all this is that talking of cannabis simply in terms of “potency” masquerading as “strength” is meaningless, we need to be far more sophisticated in the way to describe it. The measure of “potency” as used by the government is simply not up to the job, which is no surprise really as it came from the law enforcement requirements of prohibition, not from concerns of public health or any real understanding of the plant. To mean anything, “potency” has to state the concentration of both THC and CBD.
Of course, all this isn't news to experienced cannabis users. It's long been known that the old skool hash from Morocco for example was laid back and dreamy whilst some of the modern strains are somewhat “edgy” or “trippy”. But we can thank Zerrin and her team for providing the explanation in terms of the combined effects of THC and CBD on the brain and providing the science, this difference is real.
Now the the Home Office “potency” study of 2008 was close to being “cod science” because of the way it collected its data and on its lax definitions of potency but it did show one interesting result which is relevant to this discussion; the THC/CBD balance of “traditional” hashish we used to get in the UK is very different to that of some herbal cannabis on sale today. The traditional hash contained something like 5% THC and 3.5% CBD on average. Now what this means is the oils in the sample contained a total of 8.5% active ingredients and 91.5% uninteresting goo – ie mostly none psycho-active resin plus a range of minor active chemicals. The valuable bit of information here isn't the THC concentration but the ratio of the two chemicals of 7 parts CBD to 10 parts THC. That isn't too far off 50-50. It's interesting to note that the composition of Sativex – the cannabis medicine – is 51/49 THC/CBD, a composition arrived at because it had the best effectivity with the minimum unpleasant side effects.
The thing to note is that before the present prohibition policy choked off imported hash from north Africa, most of the cannabis supplied to the UK was of this type with a more or less equal ratio of THC:CBD. The policy so enthusiastically followed by our government has seen this replaced by strains which are much lower in CBD. So there we have an “unintended consequence” of prohibition, the suppression of a well balanced product and its substitution with something very different, but different in a way no-one thought important to monitor, much less control.
This is at the root of the claims that cannabis potency has increased in recent years, which is a claim often made by prohibition campaigners and used to justify continued prohibition. Far from being an argument in favour of continued prohibition however, this change was caused by it. If as the government claims it is true that high potency (ie low CBD) cannabis is dangerous for some people it is a danger caused directly by the prohibition policy.
With most – if not all – other drugs the control of the strength is important. With cannabis the composition in terms of THC and CBD is equally if not more important. This variable is determined primarily by the strain grown, in other words by the seeds sold, but also to an extent by the maturity of the plant when harvested. If the government is really concerned about the potential for harm caused by the type of cannabis on sale in the country as they claim to be, controlling and properly regulating the seed suppliers and the growing industry is the way to go. Here we have some solid science to support that suggestion.
Thus far, the law has only served to make things potentially more dangerous whilst relying on a useless measurement which is widely misunderstood, but that's how prohibition works.

The collapse of the main toll road from Tijuana to Ensenada is creating problems for San Diegans. The roadway is a main artery for many people traveling to Ensenada. NBC 7's Elena Gomez spoke to one man who is feeling the impact. (Published Sunday, Dec. 29, 2013)
The main toll road between Tijuana and Ensenada has closed after a 300-yard section of highway collapsed Saturday.
Mexico's federal highway authority said the damage happened about 10 miles north of Ensenada and 58 miles south of Tijuana on coastal Federal Highway 1D, according to The Associated Press.
Several small earthquakes, ranging in magnitude from 1.3 to 4.3, combined with heavy rainfall caused the road to crumble, the agency said.
No one was injured in the collapse, but travelers will have to take a detour inland on a two-lane, toll-free highway.
Highway Into Ensenada Closed After Major Collapse
Keith Rolle, founder of the Baja California Language College, said his students depend on Highway 1D to take them to Ensenada. They typically fly into San Diego and take a bus to the Baja for a one- to five-week Spanish immersion course.
The students who traveled south on Sunday told Rolle the collapse added about 45 minutes to their trip.
Rolle said when he heard about the damage, he was not surprised.
"I've driven back and forth from Ensenada over 700 times in the past 16 years and have gone over that particular route and that particular patch of land and have seen shifts -- sometimes 2 or 3 inches, sometimes bigger,” said Rolle. “So that's a very active fault line right there perched right on the cliffs.”
While his college's operations have not seen major delays yet, Rolle expects traffic to back up as commercial trucks travel north on the steeply graded detour road.
Ensenada's role as a major port city means large containers make land there and are often shipped to Tijuana.
“It's going to take a lot of patience,” said Rolle. “These trucks are going to really clog that one and only artery between Tijuana and Ensenada, and it's going to be tough sledding.”
Authorities said the highway will likely be closed for the next few weeks.
“The Self Owner” is an original weekly column appearing every Tuesday at Everything-Voluntary.com, by Spencer W. Morgan. Spencer is a husband and father, and has studied History and Philosophy at the University of Utah. Archived columns can be found here. OVP-only RSS feed available here.
Last week we discovered that defining liberty too broadly as “freedom of action” results in some contradictions when actions themselves reduce others' capability for action. By examining the universality of the concept, we have discovered the correct definition of liberty. It is not merely freedom of action, but the freedom to take any and all self-directing action.
This gives us a definition that can be applied universally without contradiction, and keeps the idea of liberty grounded in its implicit core principle: self-ownership. If we are not starting from the basic notion that a person owns herself, or has a unique and exclusive prerogative for self-control, then there is no basis upon which to presume that liberty is of any value.
If liberty is only of value as an implication of and necessity for self-ownership, then we must examine and substantiate the concept of self-ownership.
What is Self-Ownership?
Ownership is an exclusive prerogative of control. It includes not merely a capability of control, but a moral entitlement thereto. If you “own” something it means you have an entitlement to exclude others from use, in order to exercise use yourself. This prerogative is, to many, “self-evident” or axiomatic as the philosophers say. An “axiom” is a truth that is so evident that it is impossible to argue against it without contradicting one's own assertion in the process.
For example, if I were to maintain that I am not a self-owner, I would be using my mind to form words and express them with either speech or writing. By doing this, I am excluding all other potential users of my mind and body. In other words, I am acting upon the principle of self-ownership even in the process of trying to claim that I don't own myself, resulting in an inescapable contradiction. If we are to believe that a person is not a self-owner, or in other words is not morally entitled to self-use, then we must conclude that she must refrain from all self-use and leave the resource that is her person open to other potential users. Because this assertion would so deeply contradict man's evident condition in the world, and nature as needing to use his mind and body to survive and achieve happiness, we can reject such an assertion and thus reject all possibilities other than self-ownership. This is how we know that self-ownership, or an entitlement for an individual to exclude other controllers of his person and act freely in all self-directing ways, is a valid prerogative.
This is very short summary of the thinking behind the notion of self-ownership, and I would hope that its basic truth is resonant enough with most readers to not require further examination. If the reader would like a more systematic substantiation, the philosophical “heavy lifting” in this area has been done by Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard, and I would refer you to their work*.
Now that we've got a universal definition of liberty, and tied our value of liberty to a moral entitlement of self-ownership, we can label this concept for application to interpersonal relations (society). The label for this notion is a “right”. In coming articles we'll talk about rights and the privileges or entitlements that are often mistakenly labeled as such.
* Murray N. Rothbard's The Ethics of Liberty and Ayn Rand's “Man's Rights.”
One of the defining characteristics of F1 in 2012 is how closely matched all of the teams are.
Last year Red Bull's mastery of flexible wings and exhaust blown diffusers gave them a decisive edge. Both are subject to much stiffer regulations this year. The positioning of exhausts has been heavily restricted and there is now a much more stringent front wing flex test.
However exhaust positioning remains important, as Ferrari has shown with its 2012 car. When they first launched the F2012 its exhausts were as far to the rear as the regulations allowed (remember the ‘Acer ducts') and pointed towards the inside of the tyres. The intention was to replicate the benefits of the exhaust blow technology from 2011 by sealing the diffuser.
Unfortunately Ferrari?������s solution had adverse effects. The rear tyres overheated from the hot exhaust plume.
Also, by placing the exhausts at the rearmost point the ‘coke bottle' zone was crowded, making it difficult to get a consistent low pressure zone above the diffuser, which meant the car struggled for rear-end grip.
Even before the opening race Ferrari designers hunkered down in Maranello to design what was effectively a B-spec car. The biggest engineering challenge was to move the exhausts forward and de-clutter the coke-bottle area. Unfortunately this required the sidepods and radiators to redesigned, which required new crash tests.
The updated sidepods made their first appearance at the Mugello test in early May and featured conventional a conventional 2012 set-up with the exhaust exits as far forward as possible and blowing inboard towards the beam wing.
This single change improves the airflow to the coke-bottle zone and resulted in the F2012 gaining over half a second per lap. From that point Ferrari had a stable aerodynamic baseline from which to develop the exhausts further. The next sizeable upgrade came a few weeks ago in Montreal and was retained for Valencia.
The first illustration shows the latest Ferrari configuration, which is very similar to McLaren?������s original concept. The exhaust exit area is still as far forward as possible but now juts out over the sidepod undercut. This allows air to be aimed towards the outer part of the diffuser in order to replicate the 2011 blown diffuser effect.
The exhaust exit is shaped to pull the plume downwards so it bends towards the floor ?����ǣ this is called the Coanda effect (see earlier article on McLaren's exhausts).
The other benefit of this configuration is that clean fast-flowing air sweeps around the sidepod undercut unobstructed feeding the coke bottle zone. This creates a low pressure area below the exhaust exit which further helps ?���?�pull?������ the exhaust gasses towards the diffuser.
But what about the rear tyres – won?������t they still suffer from overheating? Partly ?����ǣ but the gasses are directed a little more inboard and towards the diffuser rather than the tyres so it is less of an issue.
The second illustration shows the direction of the both the exhaust gas (green arrow) and the airflow around the sidepod undercut (blue arrow). One can see how the exhaust solution is designed to ensure minimal interference between the exhaust gas and the air feeding the coke-bottle area. Red Bull use a tunnel to achieve a similar effect – the advantage of that solution is it allows more precise control of airflow.
In addition the yellow circle contains three slots carved in the floor. Not visible in the illustration are small slits from these slots to the edge of the floor. This means that the floor is one continuous surface as the slots aren't?������t closed.
These allow air to seep under the floor and energise the airflow around the rear tyres and diffuser, which improves the sealing effect of the diffuser edge. Red Bull tried a similar development but with holes in the floor instead – a configuration that was ruled illegal by the FIA but not before it had appeared at several races.
It is a testament to the Maranello squad that the exhaust changes have more or less closed the performance gap to McLaren and Red Bull.
But at Valencia Red Bull introduced a revised version of its exhaust tunnel concept which appeared to give Vettel a good chunk of lap time. Unlike Silverstone, Valencia isn't?������t a demanding aero circuit, so this weekend should give us a good read on how significant Red Bull?������s innovation is.

In a story June 11 about police body cameras, The Associated Press reported erroneously that moonlighting officers in Charlotte, North Carolina, are not required to wear the cameras. The department changed its policy in May and now requires officers to use the cameras while working secondary jobs in uniform.
A corrected version of the story is below:
AP Exclusive: Moonlighting police leave body cameras behind
The push to outfit police with body cameras often stops when it comes to officers who moonlight, AP review finds
By JOHN SEEWER
Associated Press
When police officers in America's cities put on their uniforms and grab their weapons before moonlighting in security jobs at nightclubs, hospitals, and ballparks, there's one piece of equipment they often leave behind — their body camera.
That's because most police agencies that make the cameras mandatory for patrol shifts don't require or won't allow body cameras for off-duty officers even if they're working in uniform, leaving a hole in policies designed to increase oversight and restore confidence in law enforcement.
Police departments contend that they have only a limited number of body cameras or that there are too many logistical hurdles and costs involved. But that argument doesn't sit well with those who say it shouldn't matter whether an officer is on patrol or moonlighting at a shopping mall.
“As long as they have real bullets, they need to have the body cameras,” said John Barnett, a civil rights leader in Charlotte, North Carolina, where shootings involving police have put use of the cameras under scrutiny.
An Associated Press survey of the 20 biggest U.S. cities found that nearly all have officers wearing or testing body cameras, but that only six — Houston; San Antonio; San Francisco; Charlotte; Fort Worth, Texas; and San Jose, California — have rules requiring them for uniformed officers working outside their regular hours.
The departments that have body cameras or are testing them, but do not require moonlighting officers to wear them, are New York City; Los Angeles, Chicago; Philadelphia; Phoenix; Dallas; and Columbus, Ohio. Denver also has them and is planning to add cameras for off-duty work.
“There shouldn't be a distinction,” said Lt. Elle Washburn, who oversees San Jose's body camera program. “You're still in uniform, still have powers of arrest.”
Just about every police agency makes it clear that officers working in uniform still represent the department and are subject to police rules even when they're off duty and paid by someone else. Trouble can happen anywhere and anytime, and when it does, there's little difference between an on-duty and off-duty officer.
Within the past three years, there have been shootings — some fatal — involving moonlighting officers in Missouri, North Carolina, Texas, Arkansas, Ohio and Indiana, but the overall number isn't known because departments don't keep those statistics.
In Louisiana, a moonlighting officer who wasn't wearing a body camera was sentenced in March to 40 years in prison for manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a 6-year-old boy following a car chase.
A key piece of evidence came from an on-duty officer's body camera showing the boy's father had his hands raised and sticking out his window as the moonlighting officer and a former officer both working as deputy city marshals collectively fired 18 shots. Once the shooting stopped, the footage showed blood on the door and an officer's realization the boy was in the passenger's seat.
Minneapolis and Atlanta are among the cities requiring the cameras for off-duty work, and some others are moving that way, including Cincinnati, which is spending about $1.2 million on 350 cameras and equipment so all officers will have one and be able to use them on secondary jobs — it's now optional.
Moonlighting officers without the cameras to back them up can be more vulnerable to false allegations, said Cincinnati police Capt. Doug Wiesman. And it might be tough to explain why an off-duty officer who used deadly force didn't have a camera, he said.
“It's a mistake not to have them,” Wiesman said. “Your officers are wearing that uniform. Who cares who's paying them?”
But most places turn off the cameras when it comes to the millions of hours officers put in work for private employers — a widespread practice but not one tracked in detail.
New York City's new guidelines covering body cameras specifically say they can't be used in any off-duty activities, including paid details run by the department.
Among the 170 departments that have received U.S. Justice Department grants for body cameras, it's rare to find in their policies any mention of equipping moonlighting officers, said Michael White, who works with those cities on training and technical assistance.
“It's an evolving issue, but I think it's something departments will need to start addressing,” said White, also a criminology professor at Arizona State University. “It should be a part of the uniform just like anything else.”
White, who developed a checklist to evaluate body camera policies, said requiring them for off-duty details wasn't really on his radar until an independent monitor overseeing changes in Cleveland's department proposed the idea in March.
But so far Cleveland's plan has been met with resistance from the city administration and police union, which say using the cameras for secondary jobs could lead to added overtime costs for officers returning the cameras to the station for charging and for uploading of videos.
Some departments say that they have only enough cameras to cover regular shifts and that they're still wrestling with more pressing worries about guidelines on when officers must activate the cameras and the increased costs to store the additional footage, which is more than the cameras themselves and can run into the millions.
"It's an evolving issue, but I think it's something departments will need to start addressing. It should be a part of the uniform just like anything else." -- Michael White, criminology professor who works with cities on training
“Great questions that I wish I had answers for,” said Ken Allen, a retired officer who now assists with coordinating off-duty jobs in Atlanta, where cameras are required for secondary jobs if the officer has already been assigned one.
Eighty percent of the department's officers work off-duty jobs either on days off or after their workday, he estimates.
Police administrators in Charlotte changed the department's policy in May and now require uniformed officers working second jobs to use the cameras after buying more this year, said Lt. David Moorefield.
Just over two years ago, moonlighting Charlotte officers in separate shootings killed a teen with a gun at a mall and seriously wounded a suspect in a restaurant brawl who attacked the officer. Both shootings were ruled to be justified.
Susanna Birdsong, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union in North Carolina, said that uneven use of the cameras is setting up police agencies for controversy and that they're “only effective if a department's policy is a strong one.”

Many of the questions directly challenged Gardner and his positions on President Donald Trump and the Republican Party's actions, but the furor seen at in-person town halls was blunted in part by the controlled environment and the fact that there was no opportunity for follow-up questions.
By the way – if you called in, we want to hear about your experience. Email me or call 303-502-2803.
Here's what they asked about:
A woman named Marilyn asked whether he supported an independent investigation into Russian interference.
“I have supported an investigation into Russia … I believe we ought to create a separate select cyber committee that will look into the Russian allegations,” Gardner said. (A “select committee” would be made up of elect members of Congress.) He noted the Federal Bureau of Investigation is conducting an investigation too.
“It's unacceptable that the Russians tried to interfere with our elections, which we know they did,” Gardner added.
Andrew in Denver asked about Gardner's stance on Planned Parenthood.
“I am pro-life and I don't think there's any doubt about that,” Gardner replied. He acknowledged that Planned Parenthood provides many health services beyond abortions, and said that he supports efforts to “take those dollars” and make them available to other providers.
The senator stood by his votes on Trump's nominees for federal positions, such as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.
“I think it's important that the president have the people around him that the president nominates,” he said.
Gardner said he voted to bring Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch to a floor vote as evidence he also supported Obama having the nominees he preferred, though Gardner voted against Lynch at the actual confirmation.
On Trump's executive order barring refugees and residents of seven predominantly Muslim countries from the United States: “We spent a tremendous amount of time and resources in this office helping people around the globe get back to their homes in Colorado,” he said, adding that he objected to the order and the president's “overreach.”
Answering a Boulder constituent's question, he said that he is pressing the White House for more details on the administration's plans to address legal marijuana.
“I had a long and lengthy visit with Jeff Sessions about his views … I believe he said that he would not make this a priority,” Gardner said, acknowledging that this seems to conflict with press secretary Sean Spicer's promise of greater enforcement of federal law.
A constituent named Heather asked what Gardner would do to ensure people with preexisting conditions, such as her child, are able to keep their insurance if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. (She added that she was not paid to ask the question, a reference to Gardner's early comments on “paid protesters.“)
Gardner didn't directly address what a new insurance law would look like, but said this is a moment to get beyond the “partisan” debate of the last six years, and he said that the ACA had kicked people off their existing plans while driving up premiums.
“If we increase affordability, then we have access to the kind of healthcare that people with pre-existing conditions are fighting and striving for,” he said. He also said that he hadn't “heard anyone says we're going to get rid of pre-existing condition coverage,” and that much of the debate in Congress focuses on keeping that coverage.
In response to another question about why he's not supporting an independent investigation into the connections between Russia and Trump and his associates, Gardner said he's supported sanctions against Russia and investigations into interference with the election, but it's too early to say whether an independent investigation is needed.
“This is an investigation that's being carried out by the intel committee and the FBI right now, and I think it's premature to talk about the attorney general's office. I think it's important to have our facts before any decisions are made,” he said.
Jane in Durango asked if Gardner would support his constituents in southwest Colorado and support enforcement of the methane rule. This is a reference to an Interior Department rule modeled after one in Colorado that went into effect in the last days of the Obama administration. It requires oil and gas drillers to capture methane emissions instead of simply venting or burning them off. House Republicans voted to kill the rule earlier this month, but the Senate has yet to vote.
Gardner said he “continues to receive feedback” on this issue. “I have not taken a position,” he said.
A caller from Aurora who identified himself as a public affairs intern with the Borgen Project asked Gardner about Trump's plans to significantly increase military spending and cut foreign aid. Foreign aid makes up less than one percent of the federal budget, though many Americans believe the number to be much higher. The caller cited Republicans like former Department of Homeland Security head Tom Ridge who said foreign aid advances American interests.
Gardner said he agreed and does not want to see foreign aid reduced. He cited aid to Israel but also electrification efforts bringing power to rural Africa and other economic development programs. He called foreign aid an “incredible way” to spread American values and reduce the need for military interventions in the long run.
“What we have to recognize is that diplomacy is far less expensive than military engagement,” he said.
At the same time, Gardner believes the military needs more money, in particular to replace aging equipment. (Obama had also called for more military spending, just not as much more as Trump.)
“If they don't have the tools, if they're robbing parts off an airplane to keep the other airplane running, then shame on us for not giving them the tools to defend themselves,” Gardner said.
Gardner had to cut the call short to go to a meeting with President Trump, but he said he would carry his constituents questions and concerns with him to that meeting.
He also encouraged people to keep calling and writing his offices, noting that his staff had recently installed a voicemail system that could accept an unlimited number of messages.

CINCINNATI -- After completing a seven-month United Soccer League season, there is little more a player wants than time to unwind.
FC Cincinnati players will get their share of downtime this offseason, but perhaps not in the same way they have in the past.
Already preparing for its third season, FC Cincinnati has cut its official offseason in half by holding organized weekday training sessions that began almost immediately after the club's first-round playoff loss at Tampa Bay. Though FC Cincinnati will break for eight weeks over the holidays before picking back up for good on Jan. 15, it won't feel like a true offseason.
"As professionals employed by a club, it's kind of our job to train in the offseason," midfielder Corben Bone said. "It's different this year, but I've been on teams before that have done this. It keeps you in shape, keeps you on the ball, and it's a good chance to work on some things we need to do to get better."
In a typical offseason, players still work out and follow a coach-implemented strength and conditioning program at home. But the key word there is "home."
Midfielder/forward Jimmy McLaughlin said he looks forward to getting back to Philadelphia, where he is from, during the team's holiday break. Whereas he normally spends some time in the offseason traveling and enjoying a big vacation, he will use his limited time off with family and making smaller trips.
He went to Mexico last year and to Australia and New Zealand the year before that, but he said he has "nothing big planned" this offseason.
Bone said the same thing, but even if FC Cincinnati had more time off, he likely wouldn't be traveling too far. He and his wife, Annie, are new parents to baby Brooks, who was born in early September. Annie is from the Cincinnati area, so the couple will spend Thanksgiving and Christmas locally but still hope to get out to Dallas to visit Corben's family at some point during the break.
"I normally try to travel and see friends and go somewhere warm," Bone said, noting that last year, he and Annie went to Thailand. "The offseason is usually our time to get away, travel to different cities and see different places. Going home for the holidays and being with family is a priority, and we are lucky that it's in our offseason so we can experience that."
The offseason also is a time to explore other hobbies, Bone said. He tries to do more reading and writing during the downtime and find other passions outside of soccer.
Sometimes he does that by finding work. Bone said he has taken or at least looked for other jobs in past offseasons because he loves "exploring that different avenue of work," but he doesn't have the time for that now with a baby.
Many USL players find it necessary to get jobs just to make ends meet, especially those who are only paid during the season, but that doesn't seem to be the case for FC Cincinnati's current roster. The club raised its payroll this year after a successful inaugural season in 2016, and although FC Cincinnati doesn't reveal financials or details of player contracts, a few players have confirmed the pay is better than other teams in the league because of the strong financial backing of the ownership group led by billionaire Carl Lindner III.
McLaughlin said he believes "most players in the league probably have to get jobs in the offseason," but like many of his teammates, he's fortunate not to have to work. McLaughlin does get paid for the youth coaching he does during the offseason through the Philadelphia Union Youth Academy that he came up through as a young player, but he does it more for the experience.
FC Cincinnati's Jimmy McLaughlin rushes in to get the ball during the FC Cincinnati vs. Orlando City B game at Nippert Stadium on Saturday, May 13, 2017.
"I've been working with a lot of kids and teams in Philly to improve my resume for the future and to learn more about the game while coaching," McLaughlin said, noting that coaching is a common way for minor league players to spend their offseasons. "It's nice to make some extra cash, but it's a fun hobby and job to do in the offseason. It's fun to see the game through a different lens as a coach rather than a player."
Coaching is also a good way to keep in shape; however, players wouldn't just be sitting around at home doing nothing anyway. McLaughlin regularly trains with several other pros at the state-of-the-art YSC, which is the official youth development training center of the Union.
For now, he is glad to get more training time with his teammates before heading east.
"It's crucial what we're doing," McLaughlin said. "It's a lighter practice than usual, but we're still getting work in and preparing for next season."
Second-year coach Alan Koch, who is in his first full offseason with FC Cincinnati, said the team -- all nine of the players signed to return -- is focusing this time on fundamentals that he doesn't have time to cover during the season.
"One day we'll do defensive concepts -- pressure, cover, balance -- and then another day we'll work on outnumbering attacking situations," Koch said. "It's basic theoretical things that are easier to work on in small group. This allows us to actually focus on some concepts with the players that we otherwise wouldn't have time for."
Even with training sessions going on, the workload is much lighter than in-season. Practices are productive but less demanding, and there isn't the stress of game preparation, scouting and lots of meetings.
So, in that regard, it is still an offseason.
"It's not all soccer-related, so we still get a little break in that sense," McLaughlin said.
Method
1. Pierce the rind side of pork with a sharp fork or knife until the skin is covered with fine holes. Insert a meat hook into the meat to secure it. Bring a pot of water to a boil and using a large ladle, pour the hot water over the rind side of the pork several times. Set the pork belly aside.
2. Heat a wok or large frying pan until it is very hot. Add the salt, peppercorns, five-spice and sugar and stir-fry for 3 minutes until it is hot and well mixed. Allow the mixture to cool slightly. When it is warm enough to handle, rub this mixture on the flesh side of the pork. Hang the meat to dry for 8 hours or overnight in a cool place or in front of a fan.
3. Preheat the oven to 200C/gas 6. Place the pork on a rack, rind side up, over a tray of water. Roast for 15 minutes then reduce the heat to 180C/gas 4 and continue to roast for 2 hours. Increase the heat to 230C/gas 8 for 15 minutes. Remove the pork from the oven and leave it to cool. Carve it into bite-size pieces, arrange on a serving platter and serve.

Lesley Paterson also works as a triathlon coach
Giggling at the absurdity of her swimming with one arm, Lesley Paterson does not sound like the sort to race a triathlon with a broken shoulder.
Or to break a hand and arm and then return to win a race six weeks later either.
Never mind fire ozone - a form of oxygen - up her own backside just to get to the startline in the first place.
And - in a way - she isn't.
"I create my own alter-ego as an athlete - essentially I am playing a character out there," the 35-year-old tells BBC Sport.
"I found that me as Lesley Paterson - nice, chatty, 'no, no, no, you go first' - doesn't work. This alter ego allows me to get feisty, angry, aggressive and be less nervous.
"I think about everything - the character traits, the things I wear, certain things I do before the race. It is like method acting.
The Xterra world championships consist of a 1.5km rough-water swim, a 20-mile mountain bike ride that climbs almost 3,000 feet and a 6.5-mile trail run
"My husband knows that that character sometimes crosses over - I can be a bit of a bitch before racing!"
It may be a character that she is playing, but it is Paterson's name on three triathlon world titles.
She specialises in cross-country triathlon, fighting her way through choppy seas, up mountains and along muddy trails to the ITU Cross World title in 2012 and Xterra world crowns in 2011 and 2012.
On Sunday, in Hawaii, she will aim to add a third Xterra world title to the European title she won in August.
From Stirling to the South Pacific...
The pineapple fields and soft white sand of the south Pacific are a long way from the rugby pitches of her native Stirling.
But Paterson believes that mixing it with the boys in mini-rugby as a girl toughened her into the athlete that she is today.
"I played for Stirling County from the age of about seven to 12. It was me and about 250 boys each weekend," she explains.
"I walked out on the field and they were all laughing and giggling at me. I had to suck it up and show them that I was just as good and hard as them.
"After rugby I did 'regular' triathlon, but that has become a bit poseur-y. Everyone has got all the gear, it is kind of clinical, a little bit sterile.
"Xterra is gritty, filthy, dirty, with a lot of heart. It has brought me everything that I had in rugby - that grittiness, that muddiness, that camaraderie."
...via Hollywood
It is glitter- not grit - that characterises Paterson's life away from triathlon.
After combining training with an undergraduate degree in drama at Loughborough University, she moved to the United States, doing a Masters in Theatre at San Diego State University.
An acting career followed with parts in a series of independent productions - including the lead in a David Gray music video.
Lesley Paterson overcame a mechanical issue with her bike to win the ITU Cross World Championships in 2012
It seems an unlikely mix - there are not many world champions with an extensive IMDB entry - but Paterson says that it helped her to sport career - and not just making by making that startline persona more convincing.
"Being a professional athlete can be a very selfish, one-dimensional, introspective world - but the arts have opened up my eyes," she adds.
"It has helped me understand characters and emotions and myself - it has given me a very different perspective."
She is now a screenwriter and producer. Her latest project is bringing together the people and finances for a film version of the seminal World War One novel All Quiet on the Western Front. Daniel Radcliffe was initially attached and now Roger Donaldson - best known for his work on Cocktail - has been signed up to direct.
Dangerous waters
Paterson has faced her own battles in the past few years. In 2011, after suffering from persistent head tics, nausea and fatigue, she was diagnosed with bacterial infection Lyme Disease.
Paterson suddenly had to learn to train smarter - improving her fitness, but without overwhelming her depleted immune system.
"It used to be that I could have an amazing day, win the world championships and then the next I could not keep up with my grandma," she explains.
"What makes me good is my ability to keep pushing through the pain, but that is the very thing that also got me into trouble.
Lyme Disease is a bacterial infection spread to humans via infected ticks. It is estimated there are 2,000 to 3,000 new cases of Lyme disease in England and Wales each year. Symptoms may include a distinctive circular rash and flu-like symptoms. More serious issues such as problems with the nervous system, heart and pain in joints can follow without early treatment. Lyme disease charities clam that as many as 12,000 cases could go undiagnosed each year in the United Kingdom.
"It is always that innate part of my personality that wants to push. I have had to mature as a person and an athlete to understand when to hold back."
But, as those triathletes who might be dodging raw sewage at Rio 2016 triathlon next summer will attest, open-water swims are particularly risky to those susceptible to illness.
Paterson goes through a regime of Chinese herbal treatments and parasite cleanses as soon as she gets out the water to help her gut cope with whatever nasties are heading its way.
And once back home in San Diego she encases herself in an 'ozone sauna' - a pod that wraps around her body and pumps the gas into her open pores - to try and kill off anything that might still be lurking. She will also administer the gas rectally to take the fight to troublesome bacteria on all fronts possible.
Neither treatment is part of the conventional treatment for the disease. But Paterson says that after trying various options, they work for her.
But perhaps the most powerful remedy comes from within rather than without.
"I just like to overcome a challenge," she concludes.
"We live in a world of people telling us what we can and cannot do.
"How we live our life, how you are supposed to heal - the doctor's standard response to tell you to lay off it for six to eights weeks - but there is no standard individual.
"If you really want to be successful in your life you have to feel those fears, find the boundaries and push against them. That comes with the potential to fall flat on your face, but I would rather do that than live in mediocrity."
NEW DELHI: Last Independence Day, PM Narendra Modi took his security detail unawares when he broke the cordon to meet children on his way out of Red Fort. This did not go unnoticed by Islamic extremist groups who have been planning to target Modi, according to well-placed sources.The special Protection Group (SPG) that protects the PM is in a tizzy over an intelligence alert that terrorist groups, including Islamic State adherents, could be preparing teens to carry out a fidayeen attack on the PM. The inputs are understood to have said that boys aged 12-15 and trained in weapons and explosives may have sneaked into the country, triggering a high level of preparedness. The alert was issued on Friday and circulated among SPG, police and intel units in NCR.Following intelligence inputs of potential child squads targeting PM Modi on Republic Day, the SPG and senior advisers have been briefed and it has been urged that the PM not breach the security cordon.The Delhi police has been asked to keep a watch for possible suspects on R-Day. The special cell too has been alerted and asked to carry out search operations. The cell has received an anonymous communication related to the present threat, a source said.The IS has recently released videos showing children learning to use machine guns and rocket launchers apart from rigorous physical training. PoK and Af-Pak-based groups are also learned to have children in their camps. One of these is Ansar-ud Tawhid (AuT), which has been helping IS spread its wings in India.TOI had reported earlier that security threat assessment has been on an all-time high. The French foreign intelligence unit, directorate general of external security and Indian agencies, assisted by CIA, have been finalising the security detail of dignitaries and across Delhi.
A long time, and well loved, resident of Yellowstone National Park, Scarface the bear, has been found shot dead. Scarface has been entertaining photographers, non-threateningly, for decades. It seems unlikely he was killed in self-defense, as he was unlikely to disturb family pic-a-nics.
ICTMN shares:
In the ongoing research into the habits of the grizzlies in Yellowstone, Scarface had been captured, collared, and released 17 times.
Scarface did survive to a ripe old age for his species, 25. In his prime, he weighed 600 pounds. He was down to 338 pounds and biologists expected this last winter to be his last. They meant a death from old age, not from gunshots. Social media were full of outrage from biologists and wildlife photographers, for whom Scarface had become a symbol of the species struggling for survival against climate change and the invasion of bear habitat by humans.
Shooting a grizzly is unlawful except in self-defense, but Scarface had a long history with people that made him an unlikely candidate to attack a photographer or a hunter. Because of the Endangered Species Act violation, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has opened an investigation into the circumstances of the shooting. Several photographers, decrying the shooting, declared that Scarface was the most photographed bear in Yellowstone.
The man who brought the Olympics to Rio is being questioned by Brazilian police as the investigation into allegations of massive corruption within the International Olympic Committee intensifies.
The equivalent of £155,000 in cash is said to have been seized after being found in a closet during a raid on Carlos Nuzman's home as part of an investigation into claims the bidding process for Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 was rigged.
Nuzman, who was head of the Rio 2016 bid committee and is a well known figure in Olympic circles, was summoned to face questions about how he secured the right to host South America's first ever Olympics amid suspicions he was a key figure in a bribery scandal. The headquarters of the Brazilian Olympic Committee, of which Nuzman is president, were also searched as part of the operation entitled “Unfair Play”.
Nuzman's lawyer, Sergio Mazzillo, told reporters outside the house that his client would co-operate but was innocent of any wrongdoing. “I can confirm that [Nuzman] did not commit any irregularity,” Mazzillo said. “Unfortunately, this has created a media spectacle.”
Brazilian prosecutors have been working with their French counterparts since February. It is understood they suspect Nuzman facilitated a $2m payment made by a wealthy Brazilian businessman into the account of Papa Massata Diack, just two days before Rio won the right to stage the Games.
Massata Diack – who recently lost an appeal against a life ban from athletics over corruption allegations – is the son of the disgraced former IOC member Lamine Diack, who it is believed voted for Rio at an IOC session in Copenhagen in 2009 in exchange for the money.
The Guardian revealed last year French prosecutors investigating corruption in world athletics had expanded their remit to include the bidding and voting processes for the Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.
Brazilian prosecutors were already investigating payments of $10m said to have been made by the businessman Arthur César de Menezes Soares Filho – known as King Arthur – to Sergio Cabral, a former governor of Rio de Janeiro.
The prosecutors suspect King Arthur and Cabral also arranged for a payment to reach Lamine Diack, former president of athletics' world governing body, the IAAF, to guarantee his vote for Rio 2016, an event which would further the businessman's own commercial interests.
Prosecutors suspect Nuzman, a former Olympic volleyball player and himself an IOC member since 2000, provided the bridge between King Arthur and Cabral to Diack. They are also believed to have found documents in Nuzman's house pertaining to offshore banking accounts in Switzerland.
A statement from prosecutors in Rio said of Nuzman: “Without his presence and the negotiation he established, the ingenious and corrupt complex relationship could not have achieved the success it did.
“ Nuzman was the agent responsible for bringing together interested parties, making contacts and oiling relationships to organise the mechanisms for transferring Cabral's bribes directly to African members of the International Olympic Committee, which was effectively done by way of Arthur Soares.”
Cabral, who was governor of Rio de Janeiro state for eight years until 2014, is currently jailed on accusations that he ran a criminal organisation and took over $100m in bribes, much of which was spent on high living and jewellery.
The Federal Public Ministry asked Brazilian courts to block $320m in assets for Nuzman, King Arthur – who is based in the United States – and his business partner Eliane Pereira Cavalcante. They are also investigating whether Nuzman secured Russian citizenship in exchange for his vote for Sochi 2014.
The IOC has frequently insisted it is fully reformed following measures taken after the Salt Lake City bribery scandal in 1999. However the Guardian revealed last year that Papa Massata Diack, who remains in Senegal with an Interpol arrest warrant in his name, had arranged for “parcels” to be delivered to six IOC members in 2008 at a time when Qatar was bidding for the 2016 Olympic Games, though it failed to make it beyond the shortlisting stage.
The Brazilian prosecutors have called for cooperation from the US authorities in securing the arrest of King Arthur.
“Vast documentation and robust evidence revealed that Cabral's criminal organisation bought the vote of Lamine Diack for $2m,” they said in a statement. “In view of this Brazilian Federal Police, prosecutors and French financial prosecutors launched Operation Unfair Play, with the issue of arrest warrants for the businessman Arthur Soares, known as ‘King Arthur' and his partner Eliane Pereira Cavalcante.
“By way of wiretaps and emails exchanged between the partners, prosecutors discovered that the businessman intended to move to Uruguay. As well as these arrests, the justice system authorised that the president of the Brazilian Olympic Committee (COB) Carlos Arthur Nuzman be taken in for questioning by federal police. As there are suspicions that the president of the COB has Russian nationality, he is prohibited from leaving the country and must hand over all the passports he possesses.
“In addition to the investigations carried out by Brazilian and French prosecutors, w e have the complete cycle of how the sale of the vote for the choice of the host city of the Olympic Games of 2016, whose winner was the city of Rio de Janeiro, happened.”
Nuzman, who was due to attend a police hearing on Tuesday evening, has yet to respond to the claims.

The Duchy of Grand Fenwick, the smallest country in the world, is nestled in the French Alps. Being as isolated as it is, its life is a throwback to olden days. It is a happy, peace-loving country. Its economy solely rests on export of its only wine, Pinot Grand Fenwick, to the US. When a California vintner starts producing and selling a knock-off of the Pinot Grand Fenwick at a lower price, the Grand Fenwick economy goes into a crisis situation, the country on the brink of bankruptcy. Three protests to the US go largely unanswered. Grand Fenwick's Prime Minister, Rupert of Mountjoy, believes the solution is to declare war on the US, and promptly lose the war in less than a day with no casualties on either side, after which the US, which it has historically done, will provide vast financial aide to rebuild the country. Grand Fenwick's monarch, the Grand Duchess Gloriana XII, ultimately supports this concept. The plan is to send an official declaration of war to the US, have a small ... Written by Huggo

London house prices fell faster than anywhere else in the country in March as the impact of Brexit finally caught up with the property market.
The average price of a home slipped 1.5 per cent in March to £471,742, dragging the year-on-year rate of increase down to 1.5 per cent, the slowest since 2012.
The house price figures from the Land Registry came as the Consumer Prices Index rate of inflation jumped from 2.3 per cent to 2.7 per cent, its highest rate since September 2013.
The biggest year on year falls were in The City, Tower Hamlets and Islington, all areas favoured by workers in the key financial services sector thought to be vulnerable to the fallout from the Referendum vote.
Richard Snook, senior economist at consultants PwC:“These figures are consistent with the Brexit related slowdown that we anticipated last year.
Jonathan Hopper, managing director at propperty buyers Garrington Property Finders, said:“These official figures suggest the slowdown is sharper and started earlier than first thought.”
“April's surprise election announcement applied a dab to the property market's brakes, but this data confirms it had already dropped down a gear in March.
“This snapshot of a slowing market – taken before the election announcement – confirms what many in the industry had feared.
"For the housing market, the snap election has come at just the wrong time – injecting an unwelcome dose of uncertainty into an already fragile market.
“Nevertheless the lull could be short-lived. If the election delivers a clear result that puts Brexit firmly back on track, the property market could receive a huge boost, freeing up more supply and with greater levels of clarity spurring discretionary buyers into action.”
Socceroos skipper Lucas Neill has become the latest of the 2006 FIFA World Cup vintage to ply his trade on home shores after signing a deal with Sydney FC.
And while the 35-year-old's return has triggered a frustrated reaction from Melbourne Heart, who believed they were going to snare the experienced defender, his signature is a significant boon for the Sky Blues as they build momentum for a late season charge.
It also presents a unique change in dynamic in the Socceroos – with the captain returning to the A-League as a means of maintaining fitness ahead of key World Cup qualifiers. Imagine Pim Verbeek endorsing such a move?
Round 21 Visit Match Centre Visit Match Centre Visit Match Centre Visit Match Centre Visit Match Centre
Ironically, it was the man who courted Neill for Heart - John Aloisi – whose return home was a tale of caution for returning Socceroos thinking of returning in a blaze of glory. It's not an easy slog.
Indeed, we can probably expect some jeers to shout out around AAMI Park when Neill steps out at AAMI Park against Heart for Sydney FC on Saturday evening.
While the composition of Holger Osieck's squad differs greatly to Guus Hiddink's 2006 model, a glance at the fabled Germany vintage shows it has actually had a strong influence on the A-League – but not all have enjoyed the fairytales they hoped for.
How will it end for Lucas Neill?
1. Zjelko Kalac: The giant shot-stopper infamously played his one World Cup game against Croatia in that tension-filled match in Stuttgart. ‘Spider', who played 54 times for his country, has been Sydney FC's goalkeeping coach since 2011.
2. Ante Covic: Australia's No.3 goalkeeper in Germany has enjoyed quite an A-League career. He returned home from Europe after the World Cup to star in Newcastle Jet's 2006-2007 triumph. He left for IF Elfsborg in Sweden in 2009, returned to be a standout in a poor Melbourne Victory outfit last season and has been a rock in Tony Popovic's Western Sydney Wanderers this term.
3. Lucas Neill: the current captain returns to Australia after moving clubs regularly in recent seasons. If he plays well, the move will make perfect preparation for the World Cup qualifiers. But is he here for the long-term? And how will he be received by the fans?
4. Stan Lazaridis: One of Australia's favourite sons found the going tough in the A-League. Lazaridis returned to Perth Glory from Birmingham City after the Cup, but only played 13 games for the club. His trademark bursts down the left were few and far between before an unfortunate 12-month suspension for failing a drug test on a substance that was soon removed from the banned list.
5. Craig Moore: The former Socceroos skipper enjoyed three decent seasons at Brisbane Roar under Frank Farina, before being cut by Ange Postecoglou.
6. Tony Popovic: Poppa, who started against Brazil at the World Cup, had a brief stint at Sydney FC and has continued his distinguished career via his magical start to his coaching job at Western Sydney Wanderers.
7. Michael Beauchamp: The tough defender was one of the standouts of the A-League's early days, at Central Coast Mariners, and was one of the bolters in Hiddink's squad. After a couple of difficult spells overseas and at Melbourne Heart and Sydney FC, Beauchamp has shown his wares at the Wanderers.
8. Mark Milligan: If Beachamp was a bolter, Milligan's selection was a genuine shock at the time, with Hiddink picking the then-Sydney FC utility more as a player of the future. Milligan's gone overseas and returned a couple of times – and remains on the cusp of a regular Socceroos spot – as he lives up to his potential at Melbourne Victory.
9. Vince Grella: The combative midfielder endured a difficult end to his career due to injury. He'd hoped a stint under Aloisi at Heart would provide a final chapter, but his body wouldn't listen.
10. Brett Emerton: After a much-vaunted career in Holland and England with Feyenoord and Blackburn Rovers, Emmo's return home to Sydney FC last season was a dream for club and player. Injury has hampered Emerton's ability to reach the heights we are familiar with, but he's been a valuable asset to Sydney FC.
11. Harry Kewell: The golden child of Australia's squad received a rock-star reception upon his headline move to Melbourne Victory. We all know what happened next, and are still waiting to see whether he'll play anywhere again.
12. Archie Thompson: It's approaching seven years since Germany, but evergreen Archie Thompson has never been a better chance of featuring for Australia at a World Cup. The Victory striker has returned to his scintillating best since his injury and Osieck is an unabashed fan.
13. John Aloisi: The hero of Australia's World Cup qualification was a star recruit when lured to Sydney FC – making him the highest paid football player in Australia. But after a decent cameo at Central Coast Mariners, his first season at Moore Park was a disaster. He was a key player in Sydney FC's run to their second A-League crown the year after, before moving to Heart.
14 Jason Culina: The midfielder was the first starting Socceroos player to take the plunge to return home during his pomp, when he became the key man in the inaugural Gold Coast United. But a disastrous knee injury, an ill-fated move to Newcastle, and his recent acrimonious split from Sydney FC has seen the talented Culina's difficult return continue.
15. Josip Skoko: The distinguished midfielder returned home after a long career in Europe to be part of Melbourne Heart's foundation squad. Hamstring injury aside, Skoko was solid, before calling it a day.
16. Mile Sterjovski: A solid returning Socceroo. Sterjovski has showed glimpses of his attacking brilliance at Perth Glory and now Central Coast Mariners, without quite stamping himself on the league.
The others:
Mark Schwarzer, Luke Wilkshire, Scott Chipperfield , Mark Bresciano, Tim Cahill, Josh Kennedy, Mark Viduka.
A 17-gigabyte file purporting to contain more than half a million images lifted from private MySpace profiles has shown up on BitTorrent, potentially making it the biggest privacy breach yet on the top social networking site.
The creator of the file says he compiled the photos earlier this month using the MySpace security hole that Wired News reported on last week. That hole, still unacknowledged by the News Corporation-owned site, allowed voyeurs to peek inside the photo galleries of some MySpace users who had set their profiles to "private," despite MySpace's assurances that such images could only be seen by people on a user's friends' list.
"I think the greatest motivator was simply to prove that it could be done," file creator "DMaul" says in an e-mail interview. "I made it public that I was saving these images. However, I am certain there are mischievous individuals using these hacks for nefarious purposes."
The MySpace hole surfaced last fall, and it was quickly seized upon by the self-described pedophiles and ordinary voyeurs who used it, among other things, to target 14- and 15-year-old users who'd caught their eye online. A YouTube video showed how to use the bug to retrieve private profile photos. The bug also spawned a number of ad-supported sites that made it easy to retrieve photos. One such site reported more than 77,000 queries before MySpace closed the hole last Friday following Wired News' report.
By then, DMaul, a denizen of the online forum TribalWar.com who declined to reveal his name, used an automated script to run nearly 44,000 MySpace user profiles through one of the ad-supported sites, MySpacePrivateProfile.com – a process he says took about 94 hours. He rolled those images into a single file and seeded it to The Pirate Bay, a popular BitTorrent tracking site, on Sunday, advertising it as "pictures taken exclusively from private profiles."
Despite the language, the script DMaul posted to TribalWar does not appear to discriminate between public and private profiles, making it likely that many of the photos were intended to be public. The script cycled through MySpace users sequentially by MySpace Friend ID number, and did not target users of a particular age group.
Even with some public photos in the mix, the haul represents a significant breach that affects users under 16 – whose profiles are automatically set to private – more than older users who must opt in to the privacy option.
As of Wednesday morning, The Pirate Bay showed two users seeding the file, and another 40 downloading it. One commenter complained that the download could take "weeks or months" to complete, prompting another to predict that, "By the end of the week it should be well distributed."
DMaul made two smaller files available as direct downloads. One of them examined by Wired News contains more than 32,000 images ranging from the mundane to the intimate: vacation photos, infants in bathtubs, teenagers mugging for the camera.
Child-safety advocate Parry Aftab, executive director at WiredSafety.org (not affiliated with Wired News) said last week that MySpace and other social networking sites should have teams that do nothing but test for bugs and monitor web forums for discussions about privacy glitches.
Last week, MySpace chief security officer Hemanshu Nigam touted a deal with the attorneys general of 49 states in which MySpace agreed to a laundry list of safety improvements on the site. However, the settlement does not require MySpace to detect or promptly close its recurring security holes.
MySpace hasn't returned phone calls on the issue. A spokeswoman for Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, co-chairman of the task force that forged the pact with MySpace, declined to comment on the bug this week. Noelle Talley, a spokeswoman for North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper, the other co-chair, noted MySpace's quick response in closing the bug after Wired News reported on it.
"We raised this particular issue with MySpace and they told us that the problem was fixed by the next day," Talley wrote in an e-mail. "We'll follow up with them on this issue."
"The process set up by our agreement gives us ready access to bring problems to the attention of MySpace," Talley added. "We believe this collaborative effort will move us more quickly toward safer social networking sites, but attorneys general won't hesitate to take further action if necessary."
MySpace plugged a similar security hole in August 2006 when it made the front page of Digg, four months after it surfaced.
For far too long, women have been woefully underrepresented in our elected offices. Fortunately, the tide has started the change as more women are running for political office and more legislative bodies place female politicians in leadership positions. We're seeing some of the latter from California, where the state Senate is geared to make history. The San Diego Union-Tribune reports:
California Senate President Pro Tem Kevin De León announced Thursday that the chamber is set to pick San Diego Sen. Toni Atkins as his successor, making her the first woman and first openly gay legislator to hold the leadership position, a move that is bringing praise from Democrats and Republicans alike. De León, D-Los Angeles, said in a statement that Atkins, D-San Diego, “will make history and be our Senate's next president pro tempore. I have every confidence she will lead America's most accomplished legislative chamber to even greater heights and build on our extraordinary progress.”
Congrats to Sen. Atkins and the California Democrats on this long-overdue milestone!
x It's my honor to announce that my friend @toniatkins will make history and be our Senate's next President pro Tempore. I have every confidence she will lead America's most accomplished legislative chamber to even greater heights and build on our extraordinary progress. #CAleg https://t.co/N7w17AUIJF — Kevin de LeÃ¡Â½Â¹n (@kdeleon) December 7, 2017

The al-Jaish al-Awal rebel coalition captured the regime stronghold of Busra a-Sham in southeastern Daraa province on Tuesday, cutting off supply routes running between the provinces of Daraa and Suwayda.
The mixed Sunni-Shi'ite town—a UNESCO world heritage site—was the regime's largest stronghold in southeastern Daraa, and was reportedly reinforced by fighters from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and Shiite militias.
A total rebel encirclement of the town and the subsequent inability of reinforcements to reach to beleaguered troops threw pro-regime Shiite militias into a state of disarray, facilitating their defeat, Ahmed Hourani, alias of the head of the Busra a-Sham LCC, tells Syria Direct's Ghalia Al-Mukhlati.
Making matters worse, the rebel fighters, including Islamist groups led by Jabhat a-Nusra alongside several FSA-affiliated brigades, repeatedly refused to negotiate a truce with the regime's governor of Daraa.
“The pro-regime Shiite militias... just didn't expect the battle to end up the way it did, with the rebels completely encircling them,” al-Hourani says.
“Retreat was not an option, as the rebels had encircled the city before the battle even started.”
Q: What spread so much fear and panic among the ranks of the pro-regime Shiite militias during the battle of Busra a-Sham?
Extreme fear and panic gripped the pro-regime Shiite militias. Some were seen fleeing in tears, ditching their uniforms as they ran for their lives. They just didn't expect the battle to end up the way it did, with the rebels completely encircling them. Regime supplies and troop reinforcements couldn't get through the rebel blockade, and neither could Shiite militias coming from Suwayda to relieve their encircled comrades inside Busra a-Sham.
It didn't help that they saw many regime soldiers killed right before their eyes. Retreat was not an option, as the rebels had encircled the city before the battle even started.

Q: Is it true that the governor of Daraa tried several times to get in touch with the Free Syrian Army [FSA] to negotiate a truce?
Yes, the governor tried to get in touch with more than one person in the rebels' leadership actually, but those attempts failed.
Q: Can you tell us more about a statement issued by notable Druze in Suwayda and elites in Daraa warning about the regime's attempt to co-opt the Druze in the fight against the rebels? Is there any truth to it?
In terms of the Druze, the National Defense Forces (NDF) is mostly drawn from Suwayda province, a Druze stronghold. And there are other sectarian games the regime plays with the intention of driving a wedge between the Houran coast and its mountain hinterland, especially since so many sons of Suwayda province were killed after joining the NDF.
So journalists in Daraa released the statement you're talking about. And we think like-minded Druze elites were aware of the matter. Currently sharp sectarian polarization plays a major role in the [regime's] recruitment of many [Druze].
This in turn led to a dispute between the Druze and Shiites in Busra a-Sham, which degenerated into armed clashes after the NDF decided to pull out of the city after the battle began.
Q: What are the rebels doing to protect the ruins of Busra a-Sham?
From the start, the rebels have tried to avoid hitting any archeological sites–they're trying to save Busra a-Sham's great historical heritage. But let's not forget how the regime toppled the “Bed of the King's Daughter.”
We're also aware of the regime's activities before the revolution. Back then, the Shiites had a green light to dig for artefacts, under the protection of the local security branch. The officers were splitting whatever they dug up.
Today, they are sending whatever they have in the way of money, and artifacts outside of Daraa. I personally witnessed excavation operations, conducted with both primitive and modern machinery. They would move the remains at their leisure, and split them up with the provincial governor and head of the security branches.
Q: Is it true that some Shiite fighters fled and surrendered to the FSA?
After the FSA distributed pamphlets—in order to avoid bloodshed—which read “whomever enters the mosque is safe, and whomever surrenders is safe,” some Shiite soldiers tried to escape, as eyewitnesses will attest.
But the regime* chased them and arrested them before a single one could enter the mosques, and then liquidated them so they would be a warning to others, so that they would not think about running away.
*CORRECTION NOTICE: The previous edition of this interview indicated that the rebels killed retreating soldiers. This is incorrect. It was in fact the regime who killed the soldiers, according to Ahmed Hourani. Syria Direct regrets the error.

As the last days of America's first Cool President wind to a close, Barack Obama took one last chance to remind us what we're about to lose, giving a warm, joke-filled speech honoring this year's crop of Presidential Medal Of Freedom honorees. Starting with a statement that this year's crop of notables—including Diana Ross, Native American rights advocate Elouise P. Cobell, Bill and Melinda Gates, and a number of athletes and actors—was “a particularly impressive class,” Obama not only managed to refer to Tom Hanks as “America's Dad,” but also to crack some jokes about Space Jam.
You can watch the full version of Obama's speech right here (it starts at 50:50 or so in the video), but a few highlights include his praise of Bill and Melinda Gates as “impatient optimists,” his description of Michael Jordan as “the guy from Space Jam,” and his quoting of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's best line from Airplane!. He also paid tribute to Ellen DeGeneres' work, both as one of America's first high-profile openly gay women, and as a free-standing joy factory, and Lorne Michaels for bringing comedy sketches like “Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer” and the recent Tom Hanks “Black Jeopardy” scene into the world. (Obama resisted the urge to reference David S. Pumpkins, though, a moment of restraint that history will probably thank him for in the long run.)

In the world of sports, Obama paid tribute to voices like Vin Scully, one of the most beloved announcers in all baseball, Abdul-Jabbar—referencing the NCAA's banning of the dunk during his college career with, “When a sport changes its rules, to make it harder just for you…You are good”—and Michael Jordan. Jordan got some affectionate teasing from the president, who not only name-checked Space Jam a second time, but also the “crying Jordan” meme. (Later, Jordan reportedly shed tears while receiving his medal, which seems like a justified response to the President Of The United States making fun of you, while also giving you the highest government honor in American civilian life.)
Obama's speech included tributes to artists, computer programmers, and nuclear scientists, but he reserved some of his highest praise for the last entry on the list: rocker Bruce Springsteen. Name-checking a number of Springsteen's songs, Obama finished with a simple, pithy line: “I'm the president. He's The Boss.”
According to a bombshell report from the Greek Euro2Day, secret minutes have been released of meetings between Turkish President Erdoğan, European Council President Donald Tusk (Poland) and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker (Luxembourg) in Antalya, Turkey and Brussels. According to the reports, President Erdoğan is demanding extortionate payments of minimum three billion dollars each year for two years from the E.U. and is threatening to drown 10 to 15 thousand refugee children and then blame it on the E.U.
Not only these things, but the E.U. delayed releasing critical reports about Turkey at the request of President Erdoğan in order to help him win reelection.
There is even a part where Jean-Claude Juncker tells Erdoğan, seemingly frustratedly, that he is “working very hard” and comments how Erdoğan has been “treated like a prince in Brussels.” Erdoğan's response?
Like a prince? Of course. I am not representing a third world country.
Obviously Erdoğan thinks so.
Read the documents. They are shocking. Story via Euro2Day and translated with Google Translate:
While some want for our country the role of scapegoat, arguing that it has made ​​the necessary steps to stem the flow of refugees, the EU leadership is silent for months about the real situation that is none other than the brutal threats of Turkey and President of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, for Europe to fall to the ever increasing demands of the neighboring country.
…
The dialogues of the meeting is shocking, and as they moved to a higher source, Mr. Erdoğan was arrogant, quarrelsome and tones of the debate had risen dangerously to the point that the meeting ended without agreement. He had reason to send refugees … buses and asked for more money, saying that the … Greece got help 400 bn. Euros from Europe.
It is worth noting that this incident, which clearly shows what the attitude of Turkey, hushed by the EU. The member states were not updated as needed (nor Greek Prime Minister had official trip to Turkey the next day!), While the journalists were given different information, that “the ball rolling” as ordered complete blackout.
…
From confidential documents suggest that Ankara has brought the EU to the negotiation table, he made ​​a deal based on promises and since then blackmailing and asking more in order to implement it. There is the side Erdoğan the “suspicion” that the EU will not implement the promises of the accession negotiations and rests there to do nothing to stem the flow of refugees. Quite the contrary.
Germany cast the blame on the European Commission for negotiations mistake. Angela Merkel, who is the third time today in Turkey and has taken the reins of the negotiations, seems to move the logic that if Turkey fulfilled will stop the refugee flow. Those who know the Turkish diplomacy, realizing that this reasoning is incorrect.
…
“If you provide EUR 3 billion for two years, you do not need to continue the discussion. Greece received 400 billion during the crisis. It should be like to capture some of those funds and to invest in a security zone in Syria, in order to solve all the problems with refugees, “he said the Turkish president to Messrs Tusk and Juncker.
When Mr. Tusk tried to explain that the money given to Greece was loans to ensure and the euro area and should not be making such comparisons, Mr. Erdoğan interrupted him saying that his country has already spent eight billion euros for refugee camps that are “model” and that he is not open to recommendations.
Mr. Erdoğan showed complete indifference to the problems of Europe and especially as Mr. Tusk said the EU was in a very difficult position and already some member states were ready to abolish Schengen Treaty after the terrorist attack in Paris.
At this point the Turkish President again stopped saying that Schengen is a European project that does not concern him. Said the documents: “Mr. Erdoğan asked rhetorically: And now how will encounter refugees, if not reach agreement? Will you kill the refugees?”.
The President of the European Council expressed an ambiguous answer, saying that the EU can make itself less attractive to refugees “but this is not the solution we want.”
Mr. Erdoğan raised more tons by saying that if the agreement with Turkey is not closed, then the EU will be faced with more than a little boy drowned on the coast of Turkey. “It will be 10,000 and 15 000. How to handle this phenomenon?” he told Mr. Tusk and Juncker.
…
“If you do not want us, say so clearly. Just want to keep the refugees, “he said and noted that if there is no agreement,” we will send refugees with buses in Greece and Bulgaria. “

we wrap up our run here at the Fillmore East with the World's Longest-Running Sandwich Connoisseurs and Billy K
SBD: https://archive.org/details/gd70-01-03.sbd.ret.19440.sbeok.shnf
set I (early)
the last day of the New Year's run at the Fillmore, and we start off with a tape cut into the beginning of Morning Dew. we won't see Dew played slower until about '74, so this version is still jaunty in the intro, but slows down in the verse. Garcia's voice also hasn't matured to the level of later years, which is a bit of a thing i think about when listening to their slower numbers. the jam sections sound almost vicious in this version, like the band is itching to melt the walls already- it doesn't help that the soundboard is blown out, so it sounds like the band is just bludgeoning you. dropping into the final segment, we get gong washes and angry playing from Garcia and Weir intertwining with Lesh's bouncing butt end. turn this up loud, i love the feeling of headphones exploding. this Dew is actually really great in the final peak, better than some of the other select versions i've heard out of this year.
the soundboard source changes before MAMU, Weir's guitar gets really loud in the right channel for some reason
we're back to the blown-out first Weir-heavy mix for Hard to Handle. the song and jam are both solid, but the source is still distracting.
Cumberland is Cumberland, with those almost-jokey clip-clop cowbells in the final chorus from Mickey
someone presumably yells a request, Garcia replies “go ahead, start it”, and the audience member yells “one two three four” in that sort of gross jokey audience way that makes you wanna jump the guy after the show's over, sorta like if people had been yelling “free bird” between songs. that's my rant ok thanks
CR&S has some cool melodic lines from Bob- the botched mix is cool to hear what he's playing, but i almost wish i had an AUD or at least MTX to compare the room sound, especially with that Fillmore room.
Alligator, and we're off to the races- Good Lovin' teasing from the drums, but they decide against it. Garcia comes in softly with some neat arpeggiated figures thrown in. after some noodling around, they slam into the Alligator jam. immediately it's like a maze of notes, dense and pounding. Garcia latches onto one searing two-note phrase and repeats it as a motif, with the drummers bashing the shit out of their cymbals to intensify it. Lesh plays the Caution theme for a fraction of the jam but it's abandoned to follow Weir's chording. a burst of feedback seems to herald the climaxing of the section, settling into a cowbell, then tom groove. spidery lines make a web with Garcia reaching up to bend the top note. Lesh keeps trying to hint at the Caution beat but we fall into a bouncy major key, GDTRFB-style. China Cat Jam. major key theme. descending line like the Eleven peak from Garcia, then the Bid You Goodnight Jam. it's fully developed at this point and sounds great. back to the Alligator theme with high chord shapes reminiscent of the Sputnik shape from Garcia. chord vamping from everyone, leading to the “ALLIGATOR” rave-up. Garcia and the band try to head into Caution but it completely falls apart at the rails and Feedback just sort of… happens.
Feedback is Feedback and no matter how different it is, it's always just gonna be “weird things happen”.
Lesh: “good night folks, thank you very much”.
(except it isn't the end of the night)
Lesh: “i'd like to take this opportunity to present a commercial from our sponsors… you thought we had a sponsor, didn't ya?”
UJB and end set.
set II (late)
late show kicks off with Casey- a tape fade in means i can't tell if they've developed the intro yet or if it's just jammed like other '70 versions (plus i don't remember off the top of my head, this blog is a learning experience for me too).
Mama Tried
Big Boss Man starts with really heavy Weir in the right channel and the mix sort of inexplicably switches Garcia and Weir. a typically solid harmonica solo from Pig. Garcia's solo seems to stay in a pretty major key, avoiding really bluesy sounds.
China Cat still has the snare work in the beginning, something i'm actually glad they dropped in this year. Constanten's organ work definitely lends a more carnival-esque atmosphere to these versions of the song. Weir's bridge solo isn't nearly a '72, but it definitely rips here as well. Garcia's solo doesn't get intense as Weir's, just a bit of mellow playing and some chording, then the drop into Rider.
Rider has the typically smoking solo from Garcia, starting on those growly Strat low strings and then working on up. the second solo blasts off immediately in a searing midrange, then cools down as they sing the a cappella chorus and end the song.
Garcia and Lesh play the intro to High Time out of the closing Rider chord, but someone yells incoherently in the background and they stop.
Mason's begins with some Phil banter about the movie it was originally written for-
“[it] was going to be shot in a parking lot- no, no, it was a drive-in restaurant- no, it was a drive-in movie… with parked cars for an audience”.
something i just noticed here- they start off with “the Mason died…”, which made me wonder if his name was Mason or if it was just his profession- then i realized they didn't sing it again that way, so maybe it was both. the first Garcia solo is much more confident this outing until they hit an odd chord that the whole band just seems uncomfortable with and they keep going. honestly, no Mason's will ever match up to the 1969-12-28 for me, but this version's end solo is strong enough, with Garcia finding a white-hot chord at the end and hammering the fear of the Lord into it. the ending organ line seems kind of botched, Phil slaps a chord and calls it a day.
Cryptical intro, something i've been appreciating a lot more recently- in my humble opinion, the song just never was the same after it left. Drum starts as complete chaos, then builds up and drops out into a quiet Other One rhythm. this doesn't seem to really go anywhere in particular. it sounds like they were playing with their hands at a few points in there, which is interesting considering Bonham did the same thing not even a year earlier in Moby Dick. TOO bursts out of the gate pretty viciously, exploring that stop-start space that many did at the time. first verse, then some more theme jamming with some stabs at chordal progression from Phil and then rhythm switching from Garcia (which doesn't seem to last and falls into the original rhythm). the jam cools off with some dissonant themes explored by Weir and Garcia, almost a Spanish Jam in the chord shapes, but not the same theme. the half-step chromatic jam slinks into the Other One theme again, which heats up with aggressive cymbal beating by the drummers. they're just beating away. beating allllll over those kits. listen to that beating. man. anyway the verse has some pretty nice early Weir Yelling™ and then we get to the Cryptical Reprise. delicate playing from Garcia and cymbal playing settles into a slinky swinging groove, eliciting some crowd clapping. a BRUTAL tape cut sets us right in the middle of the peak with the organ and gong washes, leaving the buildup entirely to the imagination. luckily, it peaks hard and peaks all over for long enough to really relish in that peak. Phil chords set the time and everyone plays gently around them as it gets delicate again, with a soft, natural segue into Cosmic Charlie.
Charlie, UJB(played for a second time since the early show), Black Peter, and Dire Wolf don't really need any reviewing, if we're being honest
the Good Lovin' jam kicks off with just Drums, before the rest of the band drops in one by one. there's a lot of rhythmic play between all members here before Garcia repeats a lick to give the jam more foundation. it suddenly drops off with accents from the drummers in between the solo and then builds back to the previous intensity. Weir's channel is pretty hot, giving the overall sonics a nice drive. Garcia plays a rhythm part to allow space for Lesh to play all over for a bit, then comes back in with a loopy solo that the drummers latch onto and almost go double time for a bit, until they enter another rhythm/accent space, stop-starting with Lesh and Garcia until they go back to playing around the beat like the beginning of the jam. this gives way to the intro and end of the song.
“everybody gets in a big long line and dance around!”
Garcia's solo in Dancin' starts off pretty low as he was wont to do at the time. it moves up again where he repeats a lot of notes- the feeling stays the same as he moves up strings. he plays some chord shapes and Lesh follows up with an interesting chord modulation. a section of triumphant 16th note runs precedes some more chord shapes with good Lesh underpinning- something i really appreciate. the band falls out and the drummers keep on going. the crowd is going nuts over this, chanting in time with them.
Weir gets the crowd to clap in sections, which is a bit hard to hear on the SBD, and Pig tells them they can't clap sitting down. the band sneaks back in, a bit of Weir solo lines under Garcia's playing, both intertwining. Garcia plays more chords to let Weir and Lesh take the song, then blasts off with a piercing high note. the tape has a few blips in here, but irons out after a few seconds. the band is essentially vamping at this point, Garcia picking hard until finally the last verse and ending comes.
Lesh: “God bless New York City”
Stephen starts off the double encore with a technical issue drawing the intro out a bit longer than usual. they falter for a bit going into the 6/8 jam segment but pull it out with an ascending bassline. back to the final verse- the “answer man” directly drops into a molasses-slow Midnight Hour.
this tempo actually seems to fit the groove really well- the vocals sound odd, but the instruments have a great swampy Easy Wind-y feel. the Pig rap fits in much better. the band finds a cool upbeat-centric accent and gets relatively funky by Dead standards. Garcia's solo has plenty of room to breathe at this tempo- in fact, it's almost exactly a half-time Lovelight jam, even the chord structure- and Phil plays some very familiar sounding lines. i'll be honest- i can't follow Pig's raps very often, for some reason i just can't pay attention. i couldn't tell you what he said- he was singing virtually the whole song, but i have no idea what he said. anyway, the last verse comes and the drummers bridge the band to the last chord dropping and they extend the piss out of it.
anyway, that's it for the Fillmore run. this was overall not an incredibly remarkable show- nothing bad or cringeworthy, but not a lot of things to write home about, either. to me, it still feels like we're running on the fumes of 1969 at this point, but i'm also a staunch 2-13 advocate so… i'll see you next time

Medivh wants you to come to his party. Hopefully he hasn't invited any Warrior mains.
The rumours were true. Hearthstone's next single-player Adventure will take place in the magical tower of Karazhan, where the powerful mage Medivh has gone AWOL from his own party. The expansion is called One Night in Karazhan , and it starts on August 11. Alongside Medivh's butler Moroes, who will also be a legendary card, it will be up to you to find the errant wizard, unlocking 45 new cards in the process, which will be dropped from four wings that will unlock weekly.
The new adventure was just announced on Twitch by senior designer Ben Brode at the ChinaJoy expo in Shanghai. He showed the new board, which is themed around an enchanted chess set, and seven Karazhan cards, five of which are class specific. Interestingly, Blizzard has chosen not to spoil the new Priest card yet. I wonder if the class is going to get something special, given it's widely considered to be dumpster tier currently. Check out the cards spoiled so far in the gallery below, with some initial thoughts on their potential power. Just click the arrows to cycle through the cards.
Image 1 of 7 Enchanted Raven As someone who's played a lot of Druids, this is interesting to me. Even before to nerf to the Force of Nature-Savage Roar combo, Blizzard was pushing the class down the road of Beast synergy. This card enables that, and also helps shore up Druid's traditionally weak early game. (Notably, it's the first 1-Mana 2/2 printed.) Would you play Enchanted Raven over Living Roots? Maybe. It's less flexible, and doesn't buff your Yogg, but will trade cleanly with most other one-drops. Should see play, if only because this into Mark of Y'Shaarj is an insane opener. (Enchanted Raven is also a stealth nerf to Ram Wrangler!) Image 2 of 7 Kindly Grandmother Just as Druid is being pushed towards Beast stuff, so Hunter is steadily becoming the Deathrattle class. A 2-Mana 1/1 won't necessarily fix Hunter's early game issues, which at one point saw MrYagut running Doomsayer, but on the upside it's a Beast which leaves another Beast behind. That will help with activating Houndmaster, Kill Command and Ram Wrangler. Perhaps still too slow against Shamans, but Hunter likes sticky cards and this will also see play. If nothing else, the art is awesome. Image 3 of 7 Firelands Portal I'm less sold on this Mage spell. Does the class really need more burn spells? That said, being able to remove something from the board, at the same time as developing a minion on your side, is a powerful tempo effect. Effectively, you're paying 2-Mana for 5 damage, which is a pretty good deal, depending on how the RNG on your 5-drop rolls. Sensational if you get a 7/8 Earth Elemental. Less so if it's a 3/3 Faceless Manipulator. Interestingly, Frodan revealed on stream that there will be five portal cards in total. Image 4 of 7 Ivory Knight Paladin gets a 4/4 for 6, which is obviously super weak, but as we've seen from Raven Idol, the attached Discover spell effect is potentially powerful. Tacking on bonus healing means that the ultra-grindy Healadin builds will be even more viable. Again, I'm confident this will be used, even if it's a bit ResidentSleeper. Image 5 of 7 Ethereal Peddlers The 5/6 statline for 5-Mana is reasonable, but does Rogue need more midrange minions in a world in which they already have Tomb Pillager? The Battlecry effect is interesting for its synergy with Burgle and Undercity Huckster, but it relies on you having the resulting cards in hand when you play the Peddler. A bit too situational for my liking, and given that Shadow-Pan Rider isn't seeing any play outside Arena, my gut feeling is that this won't either. Image 6 of 7 The Curator Okay, this neutral Mech legendary with Taunt looks dumb at a glance. But I like it. Maybe a lot. Obviously it's a “build around” card. It's too early to say what the best class for The Curator will be, and you definitely aren't looking for a multi-tribal synergy deck—but don't forget how powerful an effect drawing specific cards on cue can be. Imagine using this in, say, Midrange Paladin, in order to refill your hand with Ysera, Mukla Tyrant of the Vale and, uh, Murloc Knight. Okay, that's probably madness. But trust me, a lot of streamers are going to try to make this work. Image 7 of 7 Barnes Another neutral legendary, and at 4-Mana it's possible to compare Barnes to Elise Starseeker and Fandral Staghelm. The fact he loses one point of Health suggests his effect is a powerful one, which I guess it will be if he pulls a 1/1 version of Sylvanas, Cairne, Ysera, Tirion or some other gross legendary from your deck. But if he grabs your 2-drop, probably not so much. Still, interesting, and so far all the cards look like they'll at least be experimented with. I was initially not sold on Barnes, partly because Herald Volazj has a similar effect and has seen precisely no play. But summoning is very different to copying, in that you don't need to have any board presence for it to be good. On that basis, Barnes could be pretty strong, in an infuriating RNG sort of way. Art looks a bit Saturday morning cartoon for my taste though.
Ben Brode talks One Night at Karazhan at ChinaJoy "This party is going to be legendary. You arrive one hour before the party starts and Medivh is missing. The spells that's he cast are beginning to unravel. You need to find Medivh and save the party."
One Night in Karazhan will work much the same as previous Hearthstone adventures like Curse of Naxxramas and The League Of Explorers. Each wing will have bosses to overcome in both normal and heroic difficulty flavours, plus class challenges that reward their respective class-specific cards. The whole package can be pre-ordered from the in-game shop for $19.99, otherwise individual wings will cost 700 gold or $6.99 each.
Here's the official spiel about the game: “As Azeroth's most powerful mage, Medivh's magical prowess is surpassed only by his love for extravagant shindigs, and he has spared no expense to entertain his cherished guests—lavish feasts, impeccable Opera performances, and more await you inside.” Having not played the original World of Warcraft Karazhan raid which the set is based on, I'm essentially imagining it's a '70s funk version of Disney's Fantasia, but with greater casualties. Here's a video showing one of the encounters.
Because Blizzard likes to give potential addicts a taste of the product first, you'll also be able to sample one prologue mission for free, which will score you two of the cards. As usual, there's also a promotional card back on offer for players who purchase up to the end of the first week, and another card back if you can beat all the bosses on Heroic difficulty. Which in my experience means a visit to Hearthpwn to source a cheeseball deck that hard counters the boss's hero power. Or you could try and sleuth a deck solution yourself. But honestly where's the fun in that?
Hearthstone's last adventure, The League of Explorers, set a high bar to follow due to its high impact legendary cards. Hopefully One Night in Karazhan can keep the pace up, because with the ladder overrun by Warrior decks of every flavour, the meta could certainly use a shakeup. The new board and cinematic trailer are below.
Tsuburaya Productions announced on Friday that the Ultra Kaijū Gijinka Keikaku (Ultra Kaijū Anthropomorphication Project) is inspiring the Kaijū Girls ~Ultra Kaijū Gijinka Keikaku~ (tentative title) anime shorts. The shorts are slated to premiere on in the d Anime Store ( Docomo Anime Store ) service this fall.
Studio Puyukai (Overlord's Pure Pure Purea Desu shorts, Kōkaku Kidōtai Nyumon Arise ) will produce the anime based on the original concept of Tsuburaya Productions . Norimitsu Kaihō ( School-Live! , Gunslinger Stratos: The Animation series composition) provided original concept and is in charge of setting. A promotional video for the anime will premiere at the AnimeJapan event at Tokyo Big Sight on Friday.
The project's official website revealed that manga, novel, and other projects are in development.
The Ultra Kaijū Gijinka Keikaku project transforms kaijū (monsters) from the Ultraman live-action special-effects series into cute, female anthropomorphized monsters. The project already inspired the Ultra Kaijū Gijinka Keikaku Galaxy Days four-panel manga. Kadokawa released the first compiled book volume last July.
The project released an anthropomorphized Eleking figure in 2013 and a "Gomora-chan" figure in 2014.
Ultraman also inspired the Kaijū Sakaba Kanpai! (Monster Bar Cheers!) anime shorts last year that focus on the franchise 's monsters. A real-life bar in Kawasaki City inspired the 13-episode series.

The Secretary of State on Saturday disclosed that the United States was directly communicating with North Korea on its nuclear and missile programs. Mr Tillerson said, however, that Pyongyang had shown no interest in dialogue. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Saturday. Credit:AP The disclosure that the US had direct channels to North Korea underscored Mr Tillerson's role as a moderate within the administration. After starting his term with a swing through Asia where he said talks with Pyongyang wouldn't be productive, Mr Tillerson, on a one-day trip to Beijing, left the door open to negotiations. That's a stance that runs counter to what others in the US administration – including Mr Trump – have said.
"The first time I would have the opportunity to sit with the North Koreans it would be to say what do you want to talk about, because we haven't even got that far yet," Mr Tillerson told reporters in Beijing on Saturday. The US was in direct communication with the regime, he said, adding, "we can talk to them, we do talk to them." US and Chinese delegations, including US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and China's State Councillor Yang Jiechi, meet on Saturday in Beijing. Credit:AP The remarks – and Mr Trump's extraordinary intervention on Sunday – highlighted the divergent views within the US administration on how best to get Kim Jong-un to halt his nuclear ambitions. While some have left the door open to military action against the regime, others have warned that could set off a potentially devastating conflict in Asia. At the same time, increased sanctions and diplomatic pressure have done little to force North Korea to alter course.
Great expectations: US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and China's President Xi Jinping meet the press. Credit:AP Mr Trump tweeted in August that "talking is not the answer," while America's United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley said that the time for dialogue was over and that she would "have no problem kicking it to" Defence Secretary Jim Mattis to sort. Among senior cabinet officials, Mr Tillerson's aversion to such language is shared only by General Mattis, who said "we're never out of diplomatic solutions" when he was asked about Mr Trump's August tweet. Mr Tillerson is a chief architect of the administration's "peaceful pressure campaign," an initiative that seeks to use UN Security Council sanctions to try and choke North Korea's economy while pressing countries to stop accepting North Korean guest workers and close the regime's diplomatic outposts. While Mr Tillerson's latest remarks in Beijing appeared tailored for a Chinese audience.
One goal of his trip to Beijing, where he spent less than 12 hours on the ground, appeared to be pressing China, North Korea's chief financial backer, to bring the North Korean leader to the negotiating table. While Mr Tillerson and Chinese leaders didn't mention North Korea in public remarks, he did raise the issue behind closed doors, according to a senior State Department official who asked not to be identified. In a meeting with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Mr Tillerson said "we are still waiting" for North Korea to show it's ready to have a serious conversation about denuclearisation, the official said. Shi Yongming, an associate research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, which is affiliated with China's Foreign Ministry, said Mr Tillerson's remarks about direct channels to Pyongyang were "positive news." "At present it's an impasse, neither the US nor North Korea dares to initiate a war despite fierce rhetoric," he said.
"So whoever first offers to talk will have an advantageous position. Not only the moral ground, but also in a better position to guide negotiations. It's wise for the Americans to openly acknowledge direct talks with the North." The war of words has escalated between Washington and Pyongyang in recent weeks, with Mr Trump labelling the North Korean dictator "Rocket Man" during his first speech to the UN, adding that the US would "totally destroy" North Korea if it attacks. The North Korean leader responded by calling Mr Trump a "dotard" and warning of the "highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history." Still, Mr Tillerson said the most important thing is to ease the rhetoric. He didn't directly respond to a question on whether Mr Trump should tone down his comments. Loading "The whole situation is a bit overheated right now," he said. "Everyone would like for it to calm down. Obviously it would help for North Korea to stop firing off missiles. That would calm things down a lot."

For many decades, conservative media outlets were known for offering a blend of Christian-style moralizing and anti-government rants. Donald Trump's conquest of the Republican Party, based on a platform of lies, conspiracy theories, and coded appeals to racism has changed all that.
Much of the political press has focused on the emergence of Breitbart News, the online publication once again headed by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, as the voice of a new pugnacious nationalism eager to defy social and political taboos. But it's not alone. The Daily Caller, Breitbart's leading rival in the right-wing online space, has undergone a similar transformation.
Advertisement:
The Daily Caller's genesis dates back to 2009, when its founder, the writer and television host Tucker Carlson, made the argument that conservative journalism was too sloppy with facts, and overly focused on opinion and commentary rather than reporting.
In a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference that year, Carlson proclaimed the New York Times as a model for the right, even though he saw it as horribly biased. “It's a paper that actually cares about accuracy,” he said. “Conservatives need to build institutions that mirror those institutions.” The audience literally began booing him.
“At the core of their news-gathering operation is gathering news," Carlson argued. "And conservatives need to do the same.”
Early in its existence, the Caller actually had some news scoops exposing the misdeeds of both Republican and Democratic elected officials. But according to people familiar with the site's operations, editors decided to push a more strident right-wing line in order to drive traffic numbers, even as the Caller continued doing original reporting.
Carlson became less involved in the site's editorial operations as his TV career at Fox News blossomed. Last year, as a condition of being named host of a daily program, Carlson backed away from the Caller entirely into a passive role with no control.
The site's primary investor is onetime Wall Street banker Foster Friess, who almost singlehandedly bankrolled the 2012 presidential candidacy of Christian right stalwart Rick Santorum, a crusader against pornography and other forms of perceived sexual immorality.

Carlson's decoupling from the Caller coincided almost perfectly with the rise of Donald Trump from WWE sideshow to head of the Republican Party. It also corresponded with the emergence of the “alt-right,” the overtly racist fringe movement that has rapidly made inroads among young conservatives.
National Review, long the flagship publication of the conservative mainstream, has published several articles denouncing the alt-right, including a piece this August discussing how “campus conservatives gave the alt-right a platform” with no serious political aim other than provoking angry responses from liberals.
Without strong oversight from experienced journalists, the Daily Caller has drifted into a strange hybrid state, where conventional journalists work alongside far-right activists, several of whom have clear ties to white nationalism. Nothing makes this clearer than the peculiar story of Martina Markota, a former stripper and burlesque dancer who has been making videos for the site since September.
Markota's rise to pseudo-stardom illustrates a number of overlapping phenomena, foremost among them the right-wing media's relentless hunger for conventionally attractive young women to serve as its public faces or spokespeople.

Whether Markota is a true believer in the alt-right cause or an entrepreneur exploiting a market opportunity is not entirely clear. But she has ties to various extremist figures, including exiled Breitbart News commentator Milo Yiannopolos and Vice co-founder Gavin McInnes, who more recently launched the Fraternal Order of Alt-Knights, a would-be paramilitary group for men “comfortable in fisticuffs.” McInnes has consistently denied being a racist, an anti-Semite or a member of the alt-right, but has a long history of making dubious "jokes" that appear designed to appeal to the far-right fringe while maintaining some level of deniability.
In interviews, Markota's former associates in the burlesque world say she was always regarded as a conservative, but began to go much further with the emergence of Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential race.
“She would say stuff that was anti-feminist and we just thought it was kind of disappointing,” said one person who knew Markota in her burlesque career. “It wasn't until Trump that she started becoming more and more radical and bringing it into the locker-room.”

“Being around McInnes and his crew kind of radicalized her, because she was getting so much more attention than before,” another former colleague said.
People in the small and close-knit world of burlesque became concerned about the things Markota was saying or posting on social media. They began circulating some of her more inflammatory social media posts privately. Her appearances on McInnes' former web video show also alarmed some people who knew her, particularly a clip in which Markota appears to laugh when McInnes jokingly refers to trans people as "gender niggers." The burlesque world features many LGBT performers and has been broadly supportive and inclusive in terms of LGBT rights.
Markota did not respond to multiple inquiries for this piece. She has insisted elsewhere that she is not racist or anti-Semitic, and has also written about her admiration of Dennis Prager and Ben Shapiro, two conservative talk show hosts of Jewish descent.

"They are saying im a nazi, white supremacist and kkk," she wrote on Twitter in August. "All this thing are false and damaging to my career."
Despite her denials, Markota's social media postings indicate a significant degree of comfort with people who disseminate extremist or racist views on the internet.
A month before denying she was a Nazi, Markota told a Twitter fan that she "liked" Lana Lokteff, an openly fascist internet video host who is regarded as a role model by many women with alt-right sensibilities. She has also railed against "biology deniers," a likely reference to a common far-right complaint that progressives ignore "race realism," meaning what they regard as the scientific superiority of some races to others.
Some of Markota's burlesque colleagues were troubled by posts she made endorsing a bizarrely racist "Little Mermaid" parody song that refers to Hispanics as "wetbacks" and Jewish people as "trolls." In Twitter and YouTube postings, Markota wrote that the video clip was "hillarious" [sic]. Burlesque community members also noted a meme she posted that joked about "white power" in the context of the children's Power Rangers franchise.

As word of Markota's postings began spreading among her former colleagues she appeared to move further to the right, turning to Yiannopoulos and others for support as she found it increasingly difficult to book dancing gigs. She tried to return the favor by promoting her new friends, including a July 31 tweet in which she referenced Yiannopoulos talking about "the JQ," alt-right slang for the "Jewish question."
"Social justice warriors are creating a new generation of fascists," she wrote in September 2016, using an insult frequently employed by conservatives against left-wingers they see as intolerant. "I have extreme SJW in my industry it's the reason I'm so right wing."
Markota also lamented on the far-right social media network Gab that liberals were making it difficult to have controversial viewpoints. "Why does the left have to ruin everything? The #altright was fun until it got outted," she wrote.
In August, she reached out to the alt-right board /pol/ for dance routine ideas. She eventually settled on one entitled "Milk Is Racist," an apparent tribute to a racist chan meme that mocked celebrity Shia LeBeouf and referred to the mistaken belief that people of African ancestry are more likely to be lactose-intolerant than people of European descent.

In addition to booking her performing gigs through far-right political channels (she appeared as a "jihadist" at a party hosted by Yiannopoulos), Markota also began to pursue other opportunities, including posting news and political commentary in a blog or on YouTube.
She also began to express a new perspective toward her former "degenerate" profession. "Other burlesque dancers dildo each other and twerk on stage or use menstral blood," she wrote in July. She apparently began dating Jack Buckby, a former British politician known for his anti-gay, racist and anti-Muslim views.
Markota's efforts paid off in September when the Daily Caller began paying her to appear in daily news videos to accompany some of its articles, perhaps in preparation for hosting a program of her own. This certainly seemed to fit the Caller's business model. During Carlson's tenure, the site became known for prominently featuring celebrity content unrelated to politics, especially stories that featured women in swimwear.

Since Carlson's departure, the TMZ-style celebrity coverage has tapered off. But the Caller has become notably more open to writing from avowed members of the right-wing fringe, including Jason Kessler, organizer of the now-infamous "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Aug. 12 which ended in the death of a leftist counter-protester.
(In July, Markota used the term "Unite the Right" in a July Twitter request to McInnes on behalf of Tim "Baked Alaska" Gionet, an alt-right personality who has repeatedly praised Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime.)
The Daily Caller has also published articles by Peter Brimelow, a veteran conservative author and editor who was fired by National Review years ago for his racist views. The site also employs Scott Greer as its deputy editor, despite his friendship ties to a number of white nationalists.
The publication attracted renewed controversy in November after it announced a short-lived deal to publish columns by Yiannopoulos after he had become too toxic for Breitbart News.
Advertisement:
In interviews, several former Daily Caller staffers said these and other decisions had made them so uncomfortable that they sought employment elsewhere.
Reached via email, editor-in-chief Geoffrey Ingersoll said that sharing controversial content online did not make one a neo-Nazi.
"I like President Xi, does that make me Chinese?" he responded when asked about Markota's expressed admiration for fascist vlogger Lana Lokteff.
Ingersoll defended some of Markota's other postings as well. "She shared a goofy video about the alt right," he said. "That does not make her alt right or racist. Meeting Baked Alaska once doesn't either."

Tucker Carlson, the Daily Caller founder, declined to comment for this story.
Whether Markota stays at the Caller or goes elsewhere, she has discovered a market niche in the high demand for female right-wing media personalities. “My partner is always teasing me about how I should switch sides, so we can get rich,” one left-leaning female political commentator told me earlier this year. “I think the audience for these tokenized pundits is mainly white male conservatives, who need to tell themselves that they aren't actually misogynist or racist."
"Martina has always just wanted attention," said one of her former burlesque colleagues. "And ever since she hooked up with Gavin McInnes, she's gotten that. It's a much smaller audience, but it's a very loyal one."
To use your theme , add it together with the icon CSS file to the head of your page before the jquery.mobile.structure file, like this:
This will generate a Zip file that contains both a compressed (for production) and uncompressed (for editing) version of the theme.
Important note: We can only store this theme URL on the server for 30 days, then it will be deleted. Download a theme to keep a copy safe that you can import later.
Use this link to share a copy of your theme. People can download or edit a copy of the theme, but your version won't be changed.
ThemeRoller Mobile Help
The ThemeRoller Mobile tool makes it easy to create custom-designed themes for your mobile site or app. Just pick colors, then share your theme URL, or download the theme and drop it into your site.
Theme basics ^ Top
A jQuery Mobile theme contains a both global settings for things like rounded corner radius and active (on) state, and up to to 26 "swatches" lettered from A-Z, each with a unique color scheme that can be mixed and matched for unlimited possibilities. Each swatch sets the colors, textures and font settings for the primary elements: toolbar, content block and button. Buttons have 3 interaction states: normal, hover, pressed.
Getting Started ^ Top
The ThemeRoller interface has 3 major zones: the left column contains the inspector panel, along the top is the QuickSwatch/Kuler bar, and below this is the preview window.
Use the inspector pane to set global theme settings on the first tab and tweak the individual style options for each swatch. Above the tabs, there are links to download, share, or import a theme.
In the QuickSwatch bar, you can turn the inspector feature on to automatically expand the relevant inspector section when you click on an element in the preview pane. Drag and drop a color from the QuickSwatch panel onto an element in the preview pane and the tool with automatically calculate text color and shadow, borders, gradients and even button states. The sliders make it easy to adjust the lightness and saturation of the colors. Click the Adobe Kuler Swatches to load pre-made color palettes from Adobe's popular color palette sharing site.
The preview pane shows a sample of common jQuery Mobile widgets that live update each time you make a change to the theme so you can quickly test and tweak the theme.
Downloading themes ^ Top
Once you have created your final theme, click the Download Theme link at the top of the inspector panel. In the download dialog, give your theme a name and press the Download Zip button. This will generate a zip file that contains both the compressed (production-ready) and uncompressed (editable) theme files and a simple test page (index.html) to show that everything worked (whew) and instructions on how to add the theme to your site. It's pretty simple: link your custom theme in the head of the page followed by the jQuery Mobile structure theme and you're ready to go.
Importing themes ^ Top
The import feature is primarily designed to make it easy to either edit a theme you've downloaded or to generate an updated version of a theme for a new release of the library. When you download a theme, be sure keep the uncompressed version of the theme CSS file because this is used in the import process. To import a theme, click the Import link and paste the entire contents of the uncompressed theme file (select all > copy > paste) into the text input in the dialog, and the system will parse the theme into an editable format for sharing and downloading.
Sharing themes ^ Top
To generate a theme URL that can be shared with others, click the Share link and copy the URL. Post it on Twitter and become a famous theme artist. Anyone that opens the shared URL can edit or download the theme, but this activity won't affect your original theme. Note that due to the high volume of traffic, we can only store your theme on the server for 30 days so shared links have an expiration date. Be sure to download a copy of your theme for safekeeping.
Supported browsers ^ Top
This is a beta version of a developer tool so we're committing to supporting the latest versions of popular desktop browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari. Even though the tool works in IE9, it doesn't support CSS gradients so we don't recommend recommend using this browser to create themes. If you're running into issues, maybe try a different browser or log an issue in the tracker.
Every once in awhile, you'll hear folks talking about the scourge of youth unemployment. If you're really lucky, you'll hear them describe it as a “crisis”. But how bad is youth unemployment, really?
Well, the quick answer is that you can't really separate youth unemployment from general unemployment. As Figure 1 shows, one is a function of the other.
Figure 1: Youth Unemployment Rates, 15 and Over vs. 15-24 Age Groups, Canada, 1976-2015 (Source: CANSIM 282-001. Seasonlly-Adjusted)
As Figure 1 also shows, compared to most of the last 40 years, youth unemployment is currently fairly low. In the 476 months since the Labour Force Survey began, it has been lower than it is today only 29% of the time. If this is a crisis, it is of exceedingly long duration.
Now, what some people get upset about is the fact that youth unemployment is “twice the overall rate”. But is that really historically unique? Figure 2 shows the answer.
Figure 2: Ratio of 15-24 Unemployment Rate to 15 and Over Unemployment Rate (Source: CANSIM 282-001)
So, there are two things here on which to remark. The first is that 2:1 isn't an immutable ratio: it has changed over time, most notably in the mid-90s when it increased significantly. The second thing is that the ratio is a lot more seasonal than it used to be. It's not entirely clear why this happened. I had thought initially that it might have something to do with increasing PSE participation rates, but that doesn't seem to be the case. A mystery worth pursuing, at any rate.
In any case, we should also ask: how does Canada look in comparison to other countries? In Figure 3, I show the ratio of youth unemployment to overall unemployment in various countries. Canada's current ratio – about 1.96 – is not world-beating, but significantly better than the OECD average (2.2). It suggests that the question of youth employment ratios is actually something all economies – with the exception of the Netherlands and Germany, perhaps – deal with.
Figure 3: Ratio of Youth Unemployment Rate to Overall Unemployment Rate, Selected Countries (Source: OECD)
To get right down to brass tacks: workers gain value with experience. By definition then, young workers are, on average, less valuable than older workers. This is the reason why they have trouble getting hired. And this is why, in the end, the only way to bring down youth unemployment is to give them more value to employers; which is to say, they need more job-ready skills.
Could we do better than we are doing? Yes, of course. But even the best countries in the world aren't doing much better than we are. So, let's work on this problem, but maybe tone down the rhetoric about the its extent.

A Baltimore school tutor has been fired and charged with multiple counts of felony child abuse after a student in his care was left with a fractured jaw and two missing teeth.
Trayvon Grayson's mother says the 7-year-old suffered the injuries when the tutor threw him against a wall for acting unruly.
“I looked in the ambulance and there's my son, his face big, mouth bloody. I turned to the man, ‘I said, ‘This isn't regular restraint,” Lateekqua Jackson told CNN affiiliate WBFF.
The incident happened at the City Springs Elementary School.
The tutor, 25-year-old Timothy Randall Korr, was an employee of the Baltimore Curriculum Project, which operates a network of charter schools around the city. He told police that he removed Trayvon from his class for misbehaving.
Korr said he then lost his footing and the boy “hit himself” on the wall, according to the affiliate.
But Trayvon's mother doesn't buy that explanation.
“He can't throw himself into the wall and fracture his jaw and lose his teeth,” she said. “He's only 7 years old. He's so small he's not going to do the damage to himself.”
Baltimore City Police detectives investigating the incident examined the boy at the hospital and determined he was suffering from major trauma to his head. And after looking at a video of the incident provided by the school, they concluded the tutor had committed a crime.
Korr was charged with first- and second-degree child abuse, first- and second-degree assault, reckless endangerment and neglect of a minor.
He did not immediately respond to a request from CNN for comment. It was not clear Wednesday afternoon whether Korr had retained an attorney.
Larry Schugam, executive vice president of the Baltimore Curriculum Project, said the incident made him “heartsick.”
“This is an unusual, isolated incident for our schools, and we are participating in a thorough investigation into what exactly happened,” Schugam told CNN. The employment of the one employee involved has been terminated.”
Anne Fullerton, spokeswoman for Baltimore City Public Schools, told CNN the school district also is working with police and “will take any action warranted once the investigation is complete.”
Left getting ever more violent…
Via Washington Times:
Most people, when they want their congressional members to hear their dissenting voices, send a letter, drop an email, leave a voicemail.
Democrats? They threaten violence.
The FBI just arrested a Tucson, Arizona, man named Steven Martan for leaving messages on Rep. Martha McSally's congressional voicemail service in which he warned that her days “were numbered” and that he was planning to shoot her. He also said, according to Hot Air and other media outlets: “Martha, our sights are set on you, right between your [expletive] eyes.” Court documents filed in U.S. District Court in Tucson, allege Martan was reportedly upset McSally voted in support of President Donald Trump.
This is not an anomaly.
Virginia Rep. Tom Garrett Jr. has reportedly received at least three death threats in recent times, all over his views of Obamacare and health insurance reform. According to Garrett spokesman Andrew Griffin, one male caller making threats allegedly said that if his health care plan was taken away, then so would the congressman's life. Another hater sent a message to Garrett's Facebook page from his campaign days with explicit details on plans to kill the congressman.
Go south, and it's more of the same.
Florida Rep. Ted Yoho reported his district office in Gainesville was vandalized. He also reported a female voter leaving a voicemail message for the district director that went like this: “Next time I see you, I'm going to beat your f—ing ass.”
For the last several weeks, protesters have filled Yoho's front office lobby, causing as much chaos and mayhem as they could. The congressman, fearing for staffers' safety, finally made visitations off-limits at the Gainesville office, except for those who called ahead and made appointments.
“They're mad to the point where they're cussing at my staff, [they] pushed one of them, poured stuff on one of the staff's car,” Yoho said, in an interview with The Hill.
This is crazed behavior. And it's all coming from the left, aimed at the right.
Just recently, the daughter of Rep. Jeff Fortenberry found a sign on the family's front yard at their Nebraska home that read, “Traitors put party above country. Do the right thing for once, shithead.”

Students Cassie Li (left) and Cassie Yu, both of China, enrolled at Northeastern University.
International students flooded into local colleges in record numbers last year, especially at Northeastern University and Boston University, according to a new nationwide study.
Boston ranks third among metro areas — after New York and Los Angeles — for its number of foreign students, with 47,895, up from 43,801 the previous year, the Institute of International Education said in its annual report released Monday.
The number of international students nationwide grew at the fastest rate in 35 years, increasing by 10 percent from the previous year to a record high of 974,926 during the 2014-15 academic year.

In Boston, the surge reflects the city's growing clout as a mecca for students from abroad, including many from wealthy families, who seek the cachet of an American diploma and the experience of living in a diverse, dynamic region teeming with other students.

“It's the kind of culture everybody can sink into,” said Srikar Reddy, 22, an Indian graduate student studying engineering management at Northeastern.
At the same time, some students said, it can be difficult to assimilate with American students and even sometimes with other foreign students.
“Our English is more academic, not so oral, so sometimes I don't know how to learn the day-to-day English,” Cassie Yu, 25, a Chinese student in the College of Professional Studies, said Monday.
Administrators at Northeastern and BU said they have intentionally increased the number of foreign students as part of a strategy to prepare students to work in an increasingly global society.

“We wanted our students to feel comfortable exploring the world and they have to start by being comfortable on campus in a global environment,” Northeastern President Joseph E. Aoun said in a phone interview.
Northeastern, which has 10,559 international students, making it sixth among colleges nationwide, encourages its students to complete co-op programs, which are similar to internships. Students do co-ops in 131 countries, including Antarctica, Aoun said.
Aoun rejected the idea that Northeastern pursues foreign students simply for the money. Most international students do not receive financial aid.
As such they contribute significantly to universities' bottom lines because they pay full tuition and fees, which cost $45,530 at Northeastern, plus $14,472 for room and board.
Boston University ranks second in Massachusetts, and 11th nationally, with 7,860 foreign students. Kelly Walter, an associate vice president and executive director of admissions at BU, said the school set a goal five years ago of increasing the number of international students in each freshman class from 15 to 24 percent, which it achieved this year. BU has simultaneously shrunk the size of its freshman class, from 4,000 five years ago to 3,600, which helped increase the percentage, she said.

BU's newest freshman class had 3,629 students, of whom 886 were international. The school has also increased the number of countries students come from to 74, up from 60 nations five years ago.
“It enriches the exchange in the classroom,” Walter said.
The greatest percentage of BU students still come from China. Applications to BU from that country increased 236 percent in the past five years, Walter said.
She attributes the increased diversity to a large admissions staff — nine people — who this fall visited 400 high schools in 82 cities in 50 countries, in addition to recruiting students in the United States.
The staff is now focusing on smaller cities in many countries to reach new students and putting more information on the BU website for foreign students, such as a virtual campus tour and a video about the student visa process, Walter said.
So far, she said, there are no plans to further increase the number of international students.
A third of international students in Massachusetts, where the total number grew to 55,447 from 51,240, are from China. India ranks second, with 11 percent of foreign students, followed by South Korea, Canada, and Saudi Arabia. All together, they contributed an estimated $2.2 billion to the state's economy last year.
On Northeastern's campus Monday, international students shared a variety of experiences about studying in Boston.
Keith Bedford/Globe Staff Joey Hsu of Taiwan, who attends Northeastern, said that he finds Boston “energetic, young, and friendly.”
Taiwanese graduate student Joey Hsu, 25, said he finds the city “energetic, young, and friendly” and has made friends. His Iranian friend has invited him to visit Tehran, he said.
“I don't have to be perfect in English, as long as I can communicate, people accept me,” said Hsu, a graduate student studying global studies and international relations who was walking along Huntington Avenue Monday with a classmate.
Nearby, Saudi Arabian undergraduate Moataz Alsuhaimi, 21, said his brother first came to college in Boston and helped him adjust to a city with public transportation, colder weather, and different food.
“I like the fact that you don't need a car,” said Alsuhaimi, who studies industrial engineering and hopes to work in Boston for several years after graduation.
Down the street, Reddy, the graduate student from India, had a different take on life as an international student.
He and his friend, Sriram Kapilavai, 23, who are both from Hyderabad, said they didn't suffer culture shock because they grew up watching American movies and television.
But unlike undergraduates, who live in dormitories together, graduate students usually live off campus and have fewer chances to meet American students or those from other countries, they said.
“To be frank, there's not that much interaction among international graduate students. Indians are among Indians, Chinese are among Chinese,” Reddy said.
The study also found the number of American students studying abroad increased at the highest rate since the 2008 economic downturn. In all, 304,467 students studied in foreign countries, including 14,762 from Massachusetts colleges.

Bill Shine is reportedly in talks with the White House about working for President Trump's communications team, according to a report.
Several people briefed on the matter told the New York Times that Shine, the former co-president of Fox News and a loyal colleague of Roger Ailes, and the president's team discussed last week a position in the White House press office, which has been in flux since Trump hired — and subsequently fired — Anthony Scaramucci as White House communications director.
The White House is also considering a behind-the-scenes role for Shine.
During his time at Fox News, Shine worked closely with Ailes, who founded Fox News and was accused of sexually harassing women working for the network. Ailes died in May.
Shine was ousted from Fox News in May after he was accused in lawsuits of condoning Ailes's behavior toward women.
The former Fox News co-president has no political experience, but Shine is close to Fox News host Sean Hannity, who has served as an informal adviser to Trump and is a loyal defender of the president.
Shine, Hannity, Scaramucci, Trump and first lady Melania Trump had dinner at the White House together last week.
Scaramucci worked with Shine when he was a host on Fox News and Fox Business Network.
Shine's closeness to Scaramucci, though, may hurt his chances at a White House job following Scaramucci's removal from his position at the White House on Monday — 10 days after Trump hired him.
In an interview with the New Yorker published last week, Scaramucci suggested he was considering bringing Shine to the White House and predicted former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus would try to leak news of Shine's hiring.
"'Oh, Bill Shine is coming in,'" Scaramucci told the New Yorker, mimicking Priebus. "'Let me leak this fucking thing and see if I can cock-block these people the way I cock-blocked Scaramucci for six months.'"
On July 29, 2014, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released its report on the governance and financing of graduate medical education (GME).1 An important incidental finding of the IOM's study was that the evidence base available to inform future directions for the substance, organization, and financing of GME is quite limited. The limited evidence reflects a systematic lack of research investment in an area of health care that we believe deserves better.
Our nation's lack of research in medical education contrasts starkly with the large and essential commitment to biomedical research funded by industry, philanthropic organizations, and the public. No one questions the need for sustained support for research in cancer, heart disease, or dementia. But despite medical education's central role in creating a workforce capable of delivering the resulting biomedical advances — and despite the $15 billion in annual public investment in the medical education enterprise — funding for medical education research is conspicuously absent. As a result, we lack evidence that is essential for guiding improvements in the clinical workforce.
The current duration, settings, and organization of GME are more the product of tradition than of evidence and have changed little in the face of substantial changes in the health needs of patients and the systems for delivering care.2 We face questions about the most appropriate structure and content for GME, along with questions that extend beyond GME: What should change in undergraduate medical education, and how should we ensure the continued competence of physicians 20 to 30 years into practice? We also face active debate and a lack of evidence about how to better distribute financial support for GME, whether and how to support the education of other clinicians (in addition to physicians), and to what extent federal GME funding is an effective or appropriate tool for addressing imbalances in the geographic or specialty distribution of health care providers.
The research that could answer these questions requires funding and organization that don't currently exist. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pays about $10 billion a year toward GME but has neither a research-and-development budget to ensure that this investment is achieving its objectives nor even a clear definition of what those objectives are. Overall, the United States spends nearly $3 trillion a year on health care, nearly all of it delivered through clinicians, with no organized research investment directed at improving the way those clinicians are produced.
The IOM committee has proposed a “Transformation Fund” to fill this void. The fund would be directed toward research and innovation in the substance of GME as well as its organization and financing, and the proposal echoes the recommendations of other consensus reports.2 The committee also proposed a governance mechanism to set research priorities and coordinate large-scale efforts such as multi-institutional studies or nationwide pilot programs. We propose the following approach.
First, valid and feasible measures of training success need to be defined. The fundamental goal of medical training is the production of a workforce capable of delivering economically sustainable care that will improve the health of patients and populations in a changing environment. Our system of medical education should be judged against those goals.3 Medical education is currently assessed through process measures (whether residents get enough cases, enough lectures, enough sleep) or intermediate outcomes such as exam performance. Although competency assessment is receiving increased attention, the connections between resident competency and patient outcomes are assumed rather than demonstrated. In order to evaluate alternative processes of medical education, we need systems for routinely assessing meaningful outcomes: the quality, distribution, and cost of care delivered by the graduates of our schools and training programs. Outcomes-driven approaches have the additional advantage of fostering innovation, because when success is determined by outcomes, alternative processes can be tried as ways to get there.4
Second, we need to examine fundamental changes to the structure and content of medical education. Optimal approaches for medical training may differ dramatically from current practice. With meaningful outcomes measures in hand, we can examine more fundamental questions, such as whether graduation from medical school or residency training should be time-based or competency-based, whether the current delineation of specialties and subspecialties aligns with the country's health care needs, and which teaching strategies are best for delivering a curriculum that produces graduates who can efficiently serve the broad and changing needs of a diverse public. We also need research that can inform decisions about the most useful mix of clinical training sites and the best ways to utilize the evolving capabilities of health information technology. Indeed, the increasing availability of medical information at the point of care might allow us to reduce the time and cost of creating new physicians and redirect some resources toward keeping the practices of established physicians current.
Third, new models for financing medical education could be piloted. One reason that GME gets so much attention is that a lot of money flows through it. Currently Medicare (mostly) pays hospitals (mostly) for training residents (exclusively physicians), using a historical formula that is largely untethered to current goals. Effective change requires that we develop and test better approaches. Innovative funding experiments could include directing federal funds through state or regional consortia focused on population needs, replacing hospital cost reimbursement with vouchers that medical school graduates carry to their selected training sites, or allowing some residents (perhaps defined by specialty or institution) to bill for their services instead of having their institutions receive federal GME funding. Other experiments might assess the effect of using larger payments to direct trainees toward undersupplied specialties or geographic areas, or eliminating stipends — or even charging tuition — for subspecialties that are oversubscribed.5 Pilot programs might also distribute support across undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education — or to nonphysicians — potentially enhancing the leverage of public investment.
The fact that we lack evidence today doesn't mean that we can't have evidence for the education we will deliver or the policy changes we will need to make in 10 or 20 years. But we need to start today if we want answers then. The care we deliver to patients with cancer may require chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery, and each of those treatments has an evidence base behind it — one that's supported by a research investment that allows us to innovate and improve. Behind each of these treatments are also clinicians, and their development is also worthy of innovation. With some funding and an organized approach to research investment, we can innovate toward the future workforce we need.
“One cannot use continuous attacks against true karate. That is because the blocks of true karate make it impossible for the opponent to launch a second attack”
The above quote comes from Motobu Choki, as translated by Joe Swift, and is one of many somewhat enigmatic statements from the famed Okinawan fighter about the nature of karate. Some of his quotes, such as “when punching to the face, one must thrust as if punching through to the back of the head,” are quite straight-forward. Others, however, can be interpreted a number of ways. Since Motobu Choki is no longer alive for us to ask him for clarification, the best we can do is look at the written and photographic material that he produced, the work of his contemporaries, and the work of his students. With that in mind, we may never know for certain what he meant in this quote about blocks, but we can piece together some reasonable assumptions.
The most popular interpretation of this quote that I have seen is that Motobu is suggesting that you block so hard that you hurt the attacker's limb, and the pain stops their attack. Personally, I don't believe this was Motobu's intent. Certainly, it is possible to apply traditional blocks so hard that it causes a great deal of pain, particularly to those who are not conditioned to receive them. Those who have practiced kote-kitae (forearm forging) with partners tougher or weaker than themselves will have experience with this. That said, Motobu was known to be a fighter, who tested himself and his karate by getting into real fights, and he would be well acquainted with the physiological effects of fighting. Among This is the adrenal response, which dulls pain. Additionally, Motobu tended to find fights in Tsuji, which was a red-light district of bars and brothels, so he likely fought opponents who were drunk on awamori or high on opium, from time to time. Such people would also be numbed to the pain of a hard block. As a highly practical person with a lot of fighting experience, I doubt he would have relied on pain, alone, to stop an opponent.
That said, Motobu Choki does teach some techniques, such as the one pictured, above, that attack the limbs, but they are meant to physically disable the limb, rather than simply hurt it. In this case, he is applying chibudi/kyusho-waza (vulnerable point techniques) by striking to the nerve running along the inside of the bicep, which is painful, of course, but can also temporarily deaden the arm, making it difficult to use. This is a much more reliable method of attacking the limb, but it still doesn't fit Motobu's quote about blocks, because it only deals with one attack, and not any further attacks. So what, exactly, was he talking about? Well, before going further, it should be noted that the “blocks” mentioned in the English quote were probably called “uke-waza” by Motobu, which, as I've discussed previously, doesn't actually mean “block.” With that in mind, we can explore Motobu's statement as being about receiving methods, rather than “blocks.” This is a much larger category, so it gives us more material to consider.
I believe that the first sentence in the quote is the key to understanding the second, although it is often left out of people's considerations. Motobu isn't talking about someone throwing boxing-style combinations of punches–he is talking about a “continuous attack.” A continuous attack is one that doesn't stop until the attacker is satisfied, and that means that it is fully committed. This could be punching with the same hand over and over, or it could be alternating hands, or kicking, or any number of other methods. The key is that the attacker does not have an intended stopping point, unlike a trained striking combination, which has an intended pattern. You can see an example of this type of fighting in the video, above, where both people are continuously trying to beat the other down. This is something that must be dealt with differently than fighting someone who is using controlled combinations, and Motobu addressed this, saying; “When fighting a boxer, it is better to go with his flow, and take up a rhythm with both of your hands.”
From my perspective, there are two primary methods of stopping a continuous attack–breaking rhythm, and evasion. What you do with those methods can vary greatly, depending on your training. In looking at breaking rhythm, it is fairly clear that Motobu favored strikes. He said that “real bujutsu presses forward and blocks and counters in the same motion,” which coincides with the old Ti concept of kobo ittai (simultaneous attack and defense). In other words, uke-waza (receiving techniques) are not solely defensive–they are both defensive and offensive at the same time, as can be seen in the images of Motobu, above. If you block your attacker's initial attack and simultaneously land a significant strike of your own (particularly to the head, as Motobu often suggested), you stand a very good chance of stopping the attacker. The reason for this is two-fold. First of all, you are interrupting a committed attack, which the attacker expects to be overwhelming, so you have a psychological effect. Second, your attacker will likely be moving forward, meaning that they will be moving into your strike. As combat sports pundit, Jack Slack, often says, “creating collisions” like this is the best way to knock someone out. By interrupting your opponent's attack, and creating a powerful collision, you can end the fight entirely by knocking them out, or daze them enough to cause them to stop their continuous attack and have to reset.
Tai sabaki (body evasion) is certainly a component that can be incorporated into breaking your opponent's rhythm, but it isn't strictly necessary if your timing is good. There are many techniques where evasion is vital, however, which can be used to deal with a continuous attack. Most of these will result in trapping and tuidi-waza (seizing hand techniques), and will generally have you on the outside of the opponent's attack. By evading to the outside, you force the attacker to have to turn to follow you, which gives you time to apply a joint lock or throw. In the case of a joint lock, you can simply wrench it and disable the arm, or you can use it to control the attacker, as seen in the image of Motobu, above. You will notice in this image that Motobu is not only applying a lock to his opponent's right arm, but he is also trapping the left arm so that it cannot be used to attack. This successfully stops his attacker from continuing, at least momentarily. Even if the lock doesn't succeed, it should place you in a position where you have an angle from which to defend and counter if the attacker resumes their offense. In the case of a throw, of course, the attacker is instantly stopped (if successful), because they will have to get up off the ground and cover the distance between you to resume their attack. Once again, even if it isn't successful, it should at least partially off-balance the attacker, making their strikes less effective until they recover, giving you time to respond.
To me, these are the ideal methods of fulfilling Motobu Choki's statement about “blocks.” Of course, I truly have no way of knowing if I'm right, so this is just my personal interpretation. Perhaps someone who has trained with one of his students would be able to shed more light on it. Regardless, whether it was his intention or not, I believe that these are concepts that are integral to karate, and should be studied thoroughly. Too often, karateka practice against just single attacks, or attacks that are carefully choreographed. If we want to be effective, we must train for the chaos of reality, and returning to the roots of Ti will help us to do this, if we know where to look.
