This was a surprisingly poor game between two of the biggest teams in the Premier League. There were few tactical battles of note and both goals – John Terry and Luis Suarez the scorers – came via set pieces. The only real point of interest was Brendan Rodgers' decision to move to a back three and his subsequent change back to the favoured formation midway through the second half.
Line Ups
Roberto Di Matteo used the 4-2-3-1 formation, as he has done throughout the season. John Terry returned to the centre of defence and Fernando Torres lined up against his former club
Brendan Rodgers moved to a 3-5-2 formation, with Jamie Carragher coming into the team with Martin Skrtel missing out with illness. Glen Johnson also returned to the line-up after a spell on the sidelines with injury.
Formation Battle
Liverpool's 3-5-2 formation did two things to the character of the match. Firstly, the use of wing-backs (Johnson and Enrique) ensured Chelsea's wide players were pinned back to help the fullbacks defend. It also ensured Liverpool maintained possession at the back, but this also hindered Liverpool's attacking play as they had fewer numbers forward. As a result, Joe Allen was caught out on occasions when looking for a forward pass.
1st Half
Much of the first half, and the match for that matter, was a cagey affair. Chelsea had a few chances which came after Liverpool turned over possession and they got the break through via a corner after 20 minutes.
John Terry was able to get free from Daniel Agger much too easily and powered a header into the back of the net.
The Chelsea wide players continually found themselves dropping deep to help out when defending against the wing-backs of Liverpool. In my previous analysis of Chelsea vs. Manchester City, alongside their performances against Wigan and Juventus, it was clear they had struggled with dealing with these players.
This option, to have Hazard and Mata track back, added to the relatively dull affair.
A knee injury to John Terry late in the half was the only thing of note to end the half.
2nd Half
A similar tone continued for the early stages of the second half until Brendan Rodgers made his first substitution on 60 minutes. Suso came on in place of Nuri Sahin and Liverpool moved to a 4-2-3-1.
Liverpool improved going forward, but this also allowed Hazard and Mata to push higher up the pitch. The game opened up slightly, but the best chances still came from set-pieces or mistakes in possession.
Liverpool equalised when Luis Suarez headed home Jamie Carragher's flick on.
Good chances also fell to Fernando Torres (well saved by Brad Jones), Suarez (Cech coming off his line to clear the danger) and a late shot from Jose Enrique (Cech saved at his near post).
The match ended 1-1 which was a fair result in the end.
Conclusion
Both goals came set pieces and there were little chances throughout (only 3 clear-cut chances all match). Liverpool, with their 3-5-2 formation was able to push back the Chelsea wide players and dominate possession (56.8%) but most of this possession came from deep, with Liverpool struggling when going forward.
The switch of formation from Liverpool opened up the game but it was still a cagey affair lacking in any real quality normally associated with matches involving these sides.
America's Sorriest Bus Stop: Boston vs. Nassau County, NY
Our search for the sorriest bus stop in America — a virtual tour of the deplorable waiting conditions transit riders have to put up with — continues today with the third match in the round of 16.
Last week, bus stops in Broomfield, Colorado, and St. Louis County beat out the competition from Portland, Oregon, and Kingsport, Tennessee. There are still many more miserable bus stops to shame. Here are two of them.
Boston
This stop comes to us from a reader, who writes:
It is impossible to safely walk to this bus stop. It is located on a median island surrounded by on- and off-ramps to the Mass Pike (I-90). On the other side is the 5-lane Cambridge Street, which also has no crosswalks and no curb cuts. There is no shelter from the elements & in the winter the snow from the street gets plowed onto the sidewalk & the sidewalk is never shoveled. The MBTA is responsible for the bus stop and MassDOT is responsible for the surrounding roads.
Here's an aerial view so you really get the gist:
Agencies in charge: Massachusetts DOT, MBTA.
Nassau County
This stop is on a state highway in western Nassau, close the Queens border:
A commenter who goes by “Jason” submitted this one. He says:
This NYC MTA “bus stop” is actually located in Nassau County along Rockaway Turnpike along the Q113/Q114 route to Far Rockaway. When the route is in Nassau, no signs are posted at stops. You just have to kind of know they exist and what buses stop there. Some stops, like this one, have what is left of an old bench. This stop is on an extremely busy and congested road with no shoulder. The bus must stop in the right lane of fast moving traffic to load & unload. Passengers must remain dangerously close to the traffic at this stop.
Agencies in charge: New York State DOT, New York MTA.
The voting will be open until midnight on Tuesday.
Which bus stop is the sorriest? Boston (89%, 967 Votes)
Nassau County (11%, 117 Votes) Total Voters: 1,084
Here's a map of the six bus stops in the competition so far, with today's matchup in green. Ten more competitors will be revealed before we move on to round two.
To any person who moved to New York City after 1995, abandoned cars—rusty hulks of American steel left to rot on public property—exist almost exclusively as mental set pieces for a diorama of Gritty Seventies New York, or as part of a Gothamist photo gallery. Today, in Manhattan and the tonier edges of Brooklyn—Williamsburg, Park Slope, Brooklyn Heights, Dumbo—there's not even space to abandon a jalopy. (Chase Bank branches and bresaola-wielding specialty foods stores have displaced almost every good car-abandoning spot of yore.) But at one point in New York's history, abandoned cars were a legitimate scourge, each presenting a hindrance to traffic, a danger to children who would play in the wrecks, and a public eyesore. In decades when drugs suffused the city, forsaken cars were used as caches and transaction points. Better quilted velour with a roof overhead than a park bench. According to a contemporary report in The New York Times, in 1979, more than 79,000 abandoned cars were removed from the city's streets, alleys, and overpasses. But even that wasn't a comprehensive effort. In 1988, in an act of municipal discipline, agencies buttoned down and removed a total of 148,257 cars from city streets—an average of 406 every day. For decades, auto wreckage was such a reliable fixture of New York City streets, Volvo used a photograph of the area beneath the George Washington Bridge, rife with wreckage, to advertise its heartier, smaller cars. The idea: break the cycle of cars cheaply made, quickly bought, and soon abandoned.

Nowadays they're rarer, but they're there. Under the crumbling Brooklyn-Queens expressway, mostly, but also squatting in Brooklyn's fast-disappearing empty waterfront lots and, sometimes, just on the street, dusty with a layer of grime and a saucing of neglect. You know, abandoned cars—the least loved automobiles in a city that generally hates the things, anyway.

The city categories abandoned cars two ways, with the distinction denoting jurisdiction. If a car with license plates accrues more than three tickets, it's towed by the NYPD and stored at one of several impound lots, accruing towing and storage fees to be paid by the owner once he's identified. If, after 90 days, no owner has come forward, the car is put up for auction.
Ben Keeshin/TheDrive.com
If a car is truly abandoned—meaning no license plates or identifying features—it becomes the business of the Sanitation Department's quaintly-named Derelict Vehicle Operations. After six hours on a city street or property, the DVO unit will tag it and remove it within three days. (As a fun note, the Department of Sanitation guidelines make a special classification for luxury vehicles, though they're treated the same as any other cars. According to the DoS, a luxury car is a “Rolls-Royce, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, Porsche, Lamborghini, Ferrari, Lexus or Maserati.” Bentley, Audi, and Pagani owners are doubtless feeling pretty miffed.)

And where does a car go when it's removed? To a place like Ken Ben Industries, an unpaved lot and towing operation on Maspeth Avenue, in East Williamsburg. Two attendants there did not know if it was named for one man, “Ken Ben”, or, more likely, two: Ken and Ben. But even of unknown provenance and bearing a one-star Yelp Review, Ken Ben is a magnetic spot, because it sells cars for cheap—so cheap you'll assume there's a dead body in the trunk, or that you've stepped through a rift in time back to 1972, when it was feasible to get a used car for $200. While I watched, sitting on the back bumper of a beat-up Acura TL bleating its car-alarm like a stuck donkey, a 1999 Lexus GS300 in working order sold for $800, then an intact ‘98 Subaru Legacy Outback for $175. The last car I watched sell was a W126 Mercedes 560SEC, a big luxury coupe that sold in 1988 for a staggering (inflation-adjusted) price of $155,000. At auction, under the (hammer) of Dennis Alestra, Auctioneer? Five hundred fifty bucks, or about the cost of a 560SEC replacement bumper cover. The reason Ken Ben sells cars so cheaply is because the outfit has bought the right to auction cars in possession of the NYPD Sheriff: those abandoned, parked illegally, or repossessed by creditors. They're sold entirely as is; as stated five times by the auctioneer, the purchaser has no legal recourse against any party involved in the sale. If there's a lien on the car you buy and it gets repossessed? Well, that's part of the reason the cars are such bargains. Risk always brings a discount.
Ben Keeshin/TheDrive.com
The process of buying an abandoned car at auction begins with “inspection.” At 9:50 AM, I walked up to the gates of Ken Ben, identifiable both by its small sign and the many cars spilling beyond the fences onto the sidewalk and street, and melted into an anxious group of people milling before two NYPD officers, who blocked the entryway, arms crossed. Sheets listing the 30 or so cars for sale—year, make, and VIN—were handed out. The final line gestured at the perpetual bounty of seized and abandoned vehicle auctions: "NEXT AUCTION TUESDAY JULY 5TH @ TOWARRIFFIC TOWING IN QUEENS." There's no registration or flash of credentials. Buyers must be at least 18 years old and have enough cash on hand to immediately pay the purchase price, plus taxes and fees. An ID check is done at the point of sale to make sure that no one whose car has been repossessed is buying it back, which is illegal. New titles are available at the DMV.

At 10 AM, the policemen stood aside, and three dozen people hustled into a bumpy dirt yard and to the right, where our lot of cars, all marked with the date, “06/21”, were parked. (Or, for some, “dumped.”) For fifteen minutes, everyone milled around the cars like they comprised a mediocre brunch buffet, pulling at trim, kicking tires, and lifting hoods like chafing dish lids, finding the mechanical equivalent of lukewarm eggs. At 10:15, through a loudspeaker, the auctioneer, Dennis Alestra, announced bidding would begin, and everyone moved into a semi-circle around the window from which he spoke, which was cut into a modified camper set in the bed of a Ford F-150—a kind of modern-day revival meeting, but with the pastor selling beat-up Subarus instead of eternal salvation. Substituted in place of the rhythmic thumping of a tambourine were the crunching, slamming sounds of a Range Rover Sport being dragged backwards by a forklift over a ditch. Auctioneers are famous for their cadences and quick delivery: One-twenty-five-can-I-get-one -thirty-one-thirty-one-thirty-aye-come-on-thirty. It creates a sense of urgency, and the staccato monotone can lull bidders into a kind of call-and-response, offer-then-bid. At Ken Ben, the auctioneer kept the speed but took a more tonal approach; at times, I identified particularly rousing bouts of the auctioneer's delivery as using stolen bits of the melody from the dance hit, Macarena. It worked. Even after an auction seemed to have reached its natural end, its final value, a targeted stream of numbers and encouragement—aye-nine-hundred-gimme-nine-nine-nine-nine-nine-hundred—always seemed to eke out an extra hundred dollars for the towing yard. Or an extra $20 for the auctioneer.

The Swiss Army Knife is recognized the world over. The bright red handle with a small white cross, concealing multiple blades and fold-out tools has been the go-to pocket knife for boy scouts, army regiments and of course the everyman too, for over a century.
Invented in the 1880s, the official ‘Swiss Army Knife' is still made exclusively in only two factories in Switzerland. More than 15 million knives leave their warehouses each year.
It all started in Ibach, in 1884. A young Karl Elsener and his mother, Victoria, opened a cutlery cooperative. This small enterprise would produce the first knives sold to the Swiss Army, with the original model being called the “Offiziersmesser”, or Soldier Knife.
(Interestingly, the term “Swiss Army Knife” was coined by US Servicemen in World War II, which proved to be a lot more marketable than the plain old ‘Soldier Knife').
The knife was designed specifically for troops who needed a foldable tool that could open canned food and aid in disassembling a rifle, (as well as provide a bit of whittling to while away the hours).
It immediately proved popular with soldiers, however that first incarnation did receive complaints. So Elsener went back to his shop and made it even better, by adding a corkscrew of all things.
Overall, those early knives contained much of what we still love about the Swiss Army Knife today: a versatile pocket blade, a reamer, a can opener, and a screwdriver. All of which was folded neatly away inside an oak handle.
The other half of the Swiss Army coin originates from around the same time. The Delemont company was founded as a cutler in the 19th century and was later bought and modernized by businessman Theodore Wenger, to become Wenger, S.A.
The Swiss army later split its contract for the knives between Victorinox and Wenger in 1909. The Swiss Army knife trademark was then shared between both companies.
However, although Wenger and Victorinox are distinct company entities, both are actually now owned by the Elsener family.
Troubles for the Swiss Army Knife in recent years
Recent troubles in the industry – particularly the post-9/11 airport climate, which made it difficult to take small knives onto planes – saw Victorinox buy out its main competitor in 2005.
Victorinox, did not escape the aftermath of 9/11 unscathed however. The Swiss Army knife was shorthand for the Swiss culture from where it stemmed. The company had a sizable presence in the travel and luggage industries, and was a constant seller at duty-free stores prior to the attacks. With the Swiss Army Knife easy to use a concealed weapon, the post attack climate was very difficult for the company.
“Our company has never been as hard-hit as it was by the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in New York and Washington,” CEO Carl Elsener Jr. noted in a 2013 press release. “We lost over 40 percent of our business. Airports sent vast quantities of the knife back to us.”
However, the company saw the downturn through, with the descendants of Karl Elsener (his great-grandchildren to be precise) overseeing the production and managing of both Victorinox and Wenger – two companies that continue to employ thousands of Swiss workers.
On the subject of employment, Victorinox has a rather unique claim. The company has never had to lay off an employee. To avoid this they set aside profits during boom periods to supplement recessionary periods, as well as temporarily contracting employees to other companies as outsourced labour during recessions.
A wonderful achievement that sheds light on the attitude of the company towards its employees. In 2009, Victorinox boasted over 100 employees who had remained with the company for over 40 years.
“We consider our employees as one big family, and we have always tried to apply a strategy that allows us to overcome normal economic cycles,” said Victorinox President and CEO Carl Elsener Jr.
Both companies continue to stretch the utility of the Swiss Army Knife. Wenger Swiss Army Knives come in dozens of types. The company sells simple pocket knives with all the traditional blades, (including the good old serrated edge knife), right through to multitools like the Mike Horn Knife, a half-pound daddy of a knife with two blades and a pair of pliers built in.
Victorinox on the other hand have a full range of technological knives, that include laser pointers, USB storage drives, and fingerprint scanners with data encryption built in.
And of course, every single tool from blades to data drives, are foldable or set on springs to disappear when not in use.
Long may the reign of the Swiss Army Knife Continue.

The Barn's Furthur Summer 2012 Preview
It's been a short but productive three months since Furthur last took the stage at the Wanee festival in Florida. But this was no vacation, the most interesting thing going on in the Grateful Dead world was just how busy the band's principals while Furthur was on the shelf.
Of course, Phil has been playing around with his new bar/restaurant/music venue, Terrapin Crossroads, like it's a shiny new toy. Not only did we see a return of the most beloved Phil and Friends lineup (the Lesh/Haynes/Herring/Barraco/Molo quintet aka Phil Lesh Quintet aka PLQ aka the Q), we saw Phil take the stage with no less than 15 additional configurations, including sets with his sons and the debut of something he calls the West Coast Ramble. He managed to perform The Band's self-titled album in its entirety, as well as drop Elton John's "Levon" in tribute to his friend Levon Helm.
Not to be outdone, Weir went to work with his own supergroup, playing trio sets with Jackie Greene and Chris Robinson (both were Lesh collaborators during this time as well!) as well as a run of solo and acoustic dates, and sit-ins with Primus and Bay-area funk band Vinyl.
Though not part of the analysis performed in this article, Kadlecik, Russo, Chimenti, Becker and Pehrson also spent the time with projects of their own.
The bottom line. Each of these bands covered the Grateful Dead songbook and continued to add more to the expanded universe. Combined, all of the Weir and Lesh fronted ensembles (or solo sets) played a whopping 271 different unique songs in the relatively small break since the last Furthur show. It will be interesting to see what, if anything, of what Bobby and Phil worked on between Furthur tours will creep its way into setlists or influence performances during this summer jaunt.
Indeed, some new elements are already finding their way into the repertoire. Furthur took the stage for four "rehearsal" shows at Terrapin Crossroads late last week -- debuting "When Push Comes To Shove", "Hey Pockey Way", "Ballad Of A Thin Man" and "Nobody's Fault But Mine" from the Dead canon. I've analyzed some of the setlists for Weir and Lesh and attempted to present them in ways to reveal the possibilities as one the best Grateful Dead roadshows going attempts to that the music further in July.
Happy touring! I know I'm looking forward to the Chicago gig.

Furthur Rotation
Furthur Summer Visual Setlists
In 1984, Donald Trump constantly bragged to the press about how much cash he was raking in. That same year, as David Cay Johnston exclusively reported in The Daily Beast, he told the IRS he had made nothing at all.
Trump deducted $626,264 as expenses on his 1984 federal income tax return, and $619,227 on his New York City return. On both forms, he claimed no income.
It was a pivotal year for the 37-year-old magnate on the make, one in which he was celebrating the opening of his seminal Trump Tower, closing a casino-hotel deal in then-booming Atlantic City and angling to topple the NFL with his ill-fated purchase of the United States Football League's New Jersey Generals. He'd made himself a near-daily figure in New York news and gossip pages, often depicted as an egomaniacal wild man who shot from the hip and raked in the bucks as he shoved and nudged his way to the top of the real-estate world.
Young Trump wasn't shy about talking up his income, either.
In a GQ profile that May, written by Graydon Carter, Trump plugged a hotel deal in which he partnered with Hyatt to build a new Manhattan hotel on land Trump just leased—with the help of Equitable Life Assurance Society.
“He and Equitable had split their first round of profits before any of the tenants had even moved in,” Carter wrote.
“So we have about a $277 million sellout,” says Trump, “just for the upper half of the building. And then we own the lower half for nothing.” The partnership, unencumbered by mortgages, now collects the rents from thirteen floors of office space at $50 a square foot and the six levels of retail space at $150 to $450 a square foot. “It's a crazy deal,” says Trump. “It's better than working.”
On top of the hotel and the football team and the constant press clips, Trump also completed an A.C. casino-hotel deal with Harrah's that was reportedly going to bring him millions in annual income.
“Just as the name Donald Trump is well-known to most New Yorkers, the name is now becoming recognized throughout the country,” William Geist wrote in a 1984 New York Times profile. “He is fast becoming one of the nation's wealthiest entrepreneurs, able to buy practically anything he wants. He controls a company with assets estimated—some say conservatively estimated—$1 billion, and casino-industry analysts say his half interest in Harrah's may provide him with $40 million to $50 million more in annual income.”
Harrah's eventually agreed to give Trump $220 million to build the project and offer him half the profits it made.
One more, remarkable source of income for Trump that year: New York Giants great Lawrence Taylor.
The linebacker had struck a secret deal with Trump, banking a million-dollar interest-free loan in exchange for agreeing to join the Generals when his contract with the Giants expired. But after the Giants extended and upgraded Taylor's deal, he had to repay the million, the interest he'd collected on it and $750,000 more on top to the mogul to get Trump to agree to return Taylor's option to the Giants.
Wrote the Times: “Trump, meanwhile, was described by an associate as “delighted” to have been able to keep his team's name in the public eye while also getting a substantial profit.”
Again, this in a year where Trump appears to have claimed no income.
Trump, of course, could answer all such questions by releasing his full tax returns. Instead, he's broken with a tradition kept to by every major party presidential candidate in modern American history and prevented the public from judging his financial circumstance for itself until an alleged audit of his taxes since 2012 is completed. Even if such an audit is in fact underway, there is no law, rule, or even tradition that would preclude him from releasing the documents.
And there's nothing at all to stop Trump from releasing his taxes from 1980 through 2011—and clearing up the question of how he can brag about so much income while, apparently, reporting none at all.
Despite a decade of research, the problem of securing the global Internet's routing system is far from solved. Indeed, a key hurdle for the transition to secure routing is the fact that the Internet consists of thousands of autonomous systems (e.g. backbone providers like AT&T, content providers like Google, business networks like Bank of America), that will make deployment decisions according to their own local business objectives. Worse yet, the security benefits provided by secure routing protocols tend not to kick in until they have been adopted by a large number of autonomous systems. As a result, the conventional wisdom argues that global deployment of routing security protocols is infeasible.
This talk overviews a series of our results that challenge this conventional wisdom. We shall use both theoretical arguments and simulations to show how local incentives can be harnessed to secure
the majority of autonomous systems in the Internet. No background
will be assumed.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May says the UK faces an "unprecedented threat" from extremism
The home secretary has vowed to "systematically confront and challenge extremist ideology" as she detailed new curbs on those who "spread hate".
Radical preachers will be banned from posting material online and anyone with convictions for extremist activity will be barred from working with children.
Deradicalisation classes will be made mandatory for others deemed a threat.
But Muslim leaders warned the strategy "continues down a flawed path" and risks "alienating" Muslims in the UK.
Also among the measures within the counter-extremism strategy are:
A full review of public institutions such as schools, further and higher education colleges, local authorities, the NHS and the civil service to ensure they are protected from "entryism" - or infiltration - by extremists
An official investigation into the application of Sharia law in the UK
Extremism disruption orders to stop individuals engaging in extremist behaviour
Closure orders for law enforcement and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism
Tougher powers for broadcasting regulator Ofcom so action can be taken against radio and television channels showing extremist content
Demands that internet service providers do more to remove extremist material and identify those responsible for it
Anyone with a conviction or civil order for extremist activity will also be automatically barred from working with children and vulnerable people
Prime Minister David Cameron said the plan would work because it was "comprehensive" .
"It's no good leaving this simply to the police or the intelligence services. It's no good simply talking about violent extremism. We need to confront all extremism," he said.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Prime Minister David Cameron: "We need to confront all extremism"
He said its effectiveness would be measured by whether people were being turned away from extremism, stopped from travelling to fight for IS, and by having "more cohesive and integrated communities".
Home Secretary Theresa May said non-violent extremism could not go "uncontested" as it led to the erosion of women's rights, the spread of intolerance and bigotry and the separation of some communities "from the mainstream".
She said that applied to neo-Nazi extremism just as much as Islamist doctrine.
'Compliance test'
The Muslim Council of Britain has released a highly-critical statement in response to the plans.
Secretary general Dr Shuja Shafi said the strategy would "reinforce perceptions that all aspects of Muslim life must undergo a 'compliance' test to prove our loyalty to this country".
"These measures could be seen more as a means to address the anxieties a minority of people may have against Muslims and their religious life, rather than the scourge of terrorism itself," he said.
Dr Shafi also said he detected "McCarthyist undertones" in the plans to create blacklists and exclude and ban people those deemed to be extremists.
Mr Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, said the announcement was a "missed opportunity to really engage the Muslim community".
But Fiyaz Mughal, director of the interfaith Faith Matters organisation, said there was much in the plans that could "help in the battle against those who promote extremism".
Analysis

Robin Brant, BBC political correspondent
At the heart of this considerable strategy on counter extremism are two significant challenges for the prime minister: the internet and the law.
Getting inciteful content off the web and getting "counter narrative" content up there is key to harnessing the full potential of a medium that IS has already mastered.
There has been much focus on the mosques but bedroom radicalisation is something the prime minister and MI5 worry intensely about.
The process of trying to persuade Facebook, Twitter and other social media giants to help is ongoing.
On the second point, the plans to introduce new powers to restrict what extremists can do and where they can go are still in their legal infancy.
The government concedes they will need to be properly targeted. It is still consulting with lawyers and community groups to try to get the balance right.
Police estimate at least 700 people from the UK have travelled to support or fight for jihadist organisations in Syria and Iraq, such as the so-called Islamic State, and the government believes tackling non-violent extremism is key to stemming the flow of people.
Parents of children aged under 16 have had the power to request the cancellation of passports - even where a child has taken or hidden the actual document - since July.
That power is being extended to parents of 16 and 17-year-olds, allowing families to contact a passport office where officials will investigate their concerns before a final decision is taken by the home secretary.
Mrs May said the measure had only been used by "a small number" of parents since July, but it was part of a package of new powers that would help tackle extremism.
Shadow policing minister Jack Dromey said it was "crucial we get the balance right" and that Mr Cameron must "be very careful not to use the language he used earlier in the summer that somehow the Muslim community is not standing up to terrorism".
Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the announcements amounted to "rhetoric that may well divide communities and make our job of working with those communities to find and isolate terrorists and potential terrorists that much harder".
Blac Youngsta has had his share of disappointing customer experiences, such as in January of this year when he was detained for making a large withdrawal at a Wells Fargo in Atlanta, but based on the above video, his frustrations with a Walmart employee may be a result of his own ill-advised actions. It would appear that Youngsta was attempting to lift a Twix candy bar and was called out by a cashier who then mimes a telephone, likely attempting to get a hold of security. As a result, the rapper asks the cashier how much she makes in a year in an effort to embarrass her.
"They do not pay your ass to snitch," he says to the camera later on, noting that he has family who have worked for the discount department store. "They pay your ass to work and ring the motherfuckin' register, ho." Two points to consider here: retail companies often do train their staff in loss prevention techniques with monthly and annual losses a reflection of the staff and whether or not a candy bar is highly valued inventory seems less important considering how brazen the rapper is being about it. The video doesn't show the whole exchange, cuts coming fairly rapidly, but the question remains, why didn't he just pay the $1.25 in the first place?

The security cameras are in addition to metal detectors placed last week at the Lion's Gate entrance to the site, known as the Temple Mount to Jews and the Noble Sanctuary to Muslims.
The metal detectors -- seen by Palestinians and Arab countries as an attempt by Israel to unilaterally exert control over the holy site -- triggered widespread protests across Jerusalem and the West Bank. The added installation of security cameras is liable to spark more protests.
Israel installed the metal detectors after an attack at the site in which two Israeli police officers were killed . The metal detectors may be the immediate reason for protests that have broken out across the region; it is control of the holy site that is at the heart of this outbreak of demonstrations.
Key developments:
- Israel installed security cameras near the entrance to Old City of Jerusalem holy site early Sunday morning.
- New decisions about security measures in the Old City could be made at a Sunday night Israeli security cabinet meeting.
- Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas suspended contact, including security coordination, between the Palestinian Authority and Israel.
- Four Palestinians were killed in ongoing demonstrations against Israeli security forces Friday and Saturday.
International community urges restraint
The United Nations Security Council called a meeting for Monday to discuss the latest development in the region. The Middle East Quartet, consisting of the United States, Russia, the United Nations, and European Union, issued a statement on Saturday calling on all sides "to demonstrate maximum restraint, refrain from provocative actions and work towards de-escalating the situation." White House senior adviser Jared Kushner , President Donald Trump's son-in-law, is leading a White House effort to address the crisis.
Security cameras have been installed at the entrance of one of Jerusalem's holiest sites, known as the Temple Mount to Jews and the Noble Sanctuary to Muslims.
The Arab League has postponed its emergency meeting to address rising tensions in the West Bank and Jerusalem, the organization said on its Facebook and Twitter accounts on Sunday. The meeting, originally set for Wednesday, is to be held on Thursday.
The delay was to ensure a large number of Arab foreign ministers could participate in the meeting, according to Kuwait's news agency KUNA.
"Jerusalem is a red line that Arabs and Muslims wouldn't allow to be crossed," said Arab League Chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit in a statement. "Israel is playing with fire and is risking sparking a crisis with the Arab and Muslim worlds."
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has often touted improving relations with Sunni Muslim states in the Middle East, understood to mean Saudi Arabia, though Israel has no diplomatic relations with the Saudis.
On Sunday, Pope Francis appealed for "moderation and dialogue" at his weekly address from St. Peter's Square at the Vatican. "I ask you to join me in prayer for the Lord to inspire in all sides proposals for reconciliation and peace," he said.
Palestinians freeze contact with Israel
At Sunday's weekly government meeting, Netanyahu said Israel is constantly monitoring the security situation in Jerusalem and will "decide accordingly" what actions to take. A security cabinet meeting scheduled for Sunday night could bring a new decision about the metal detectors and other security measures taken in the Old City of Jerusalem.
"We are conducting this calmly, determinedly and responsibly and thus we will continue to act in order to maintain security," Netanyahu said.
Palestinians on Friday carry the body of a man who was killed during clashes with Israeli forces.
President Abbas suspended all contacts between the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli government on Friday in protest of the metal detectors. The suspension includes the rare move of freezing security coordination, seen as a bedrock of Israeli-Palestinian relations. An Israeli military official said they are "evaluating and assessing what the declarations mean on the ground," calling it a "complex reality."
A violent weekend
On Sunday, a shooting at the Israeli Embassy compound in Amman left a Jordanian dead and an Israeli and a Jordanian wounded, Jordan's Public Security Department said, according to a report by Jordan's official Petra news agency.
The motive is unclear and there's no evidence the incident is connected to the tensions in Jerusalem. the department said.
The department said police rushed to the scene of the incident and evacuated the three for treatment. A Jordanian was pronounced dead on arrival at a hospital.
Local media in Jordan, including one affiliated with the armed forces, are reporting heavy security presence around the embassy.
A significant percentage of Jordan's population is of Palestinian origin and a Jordanian religious authority, the Waqf, administers the Temple Mount/Noble Sanctuary.
On Friday, thousands of Jordanians took to the streets to protest the situation in Jerusalem.
Earlier in the weekend, on Friday night, three Israelis were killed in their home in the West Bank settlement of Halamish when police say a young Palestinian man breached the settlement's security fence and stabbed them to death. Yosef Solomon, 70, and his son, Elad, and daughter, Chaya, died in the attack. Their funerals will take place Sunday evening.
Netanyahu said Israel would look to destroy the home of the attacker as soon as possible, a routine measure intended as a deterrent against future attacks.
The Israeli military arrested more than 20 Palestinians in an overnight sweep on Sunday near the site of Friday night's attack, according to an Israeli military official. The Palestinians were suspected of preparing attacks in the immediate future or of being members of the militant group Hamas, the official said.
Meanwhile, four Palestinians have been killed in ongoing demonstrations against Israeli security forces Friday and Saturday. On Saturday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health identified the latest Palestinian killed as Yousef Kashour, 24, from the village of el-Eizaryia.
Hello there judges!
This week our interview team made a stop in South Carolina to catch this judge who has really impressed us with his community work. He is a devoted Elspeth and Star Wars fan with an excellent sense of humor and more than one odd story under his belt. Don't miss this interview with David Andrew Truitt !
Name: David Truitt
Level: 2
Location: Wagener, South Carolina
Judge start date:
L1 by Pierson Payne 3/3/2012
L2 by Jason Reedy 5/11/2013
Why did you become a judge?
When I got back into the game with Scars of Mirrodin, the small store I played in had a newer player base. Since I was the only one who understood the stack (from playing MTGO years before), I became the go-to rules guy. Then the store wanted GPTs and well…stuff.
Occupation: “Everything/Odd jobs” this makes for decent stories.
Favorite card: Elspeth, Knight-Errant
Least favorite card: Soul Tithe. When spoilers were up, I was so happy because I thought it was a Mana Tithe reprint.
Favorite format: Limited Sealed
Commander General: Reaper King/Progenitus (same deck, just got the Russian Progenitus and haven't made the switch)
Favorite non-Magic Game: Morrowind/Skyrim
Best tournament result: 3-4 at a PTQ
Random fact about yourself: I have a goat foot and I poke people with it.
How did you get involved in Magic in the first place?
Going to middle/high school, I had a friend on the bus and he had me keep his cards because his parents didn't care for the game (the classic It's demonic! bit). Finally I broke down and learned the game.
How has being a judge influenced your non-Magic life?
You mean besides the busy weekends, countless friends, and meeting my girlfriend (hi Marcie !)? It's forced me to step up into positions I never thought I'd find myself (mentoring judges, teaching players, a leader in my community). I'm still my shy and quiet self though I've learned when to speak up (both in volume and when it needs to be done). Oh and the crisis skills; it's amazing how many crises are in a card game…
You were nominated by Michael F Grimsley because of your awesome skills at being a leader and a mentor. How do you see these qualities relating to building a solid training process for L1 candidates?
The biggest thing is it goes past the L1 test and I feel that's the program's biggest weakness at the moment. We have “how to become a L1” and “how to become a L2 (with new updated requirements)” but not much in my experience on “how to be a better L1 (or even just “judge”).” When I tested for L1, Pierson quit judging like three weeks out. And the only other judge I knew at the time decided to take some time off from judging. I didn't meet another judge until October for States and I knew nothing about the online community. So for me, continuing to mentor and help my judglings (and those I've adopted) is key to making them better. It takes being at an event to give decent feedback instead of just hearing about it after the fact. It takes answering those weird draft questions over the phone at two in the morning. To bring it back to L1 candidates, it truly does take working at least a couple events before knowing the person well enough to see if they've got what it takes and that's the perfect opportunity to show them that there's at least one person that cares about them doing well (plus it's a bonus that they're close instead of being hours away like a RC might be or the L2 from a GP who tested them).
What motivates you to continue being a judge?
Hearing that one player say “this event was better than the last one” or something like that. In the very end, it's all about players' happiness. On an almost equal point, continuing to help my local judges get better as both judges and people in general (not saying they're bad people to start with…but “do better” is always a good goal to set).
What is one tip you have for other judges?
Feedback. I know everyone is pushing for written reviews and my RC Justin Turner is doing a blog now on not just face to face feedback but all types of feedback. Give it, listen to it, use it, do better. Don't be afraid to tell another judge “this was awkward” or “this was bad” (but give the details too!). We're each one brain but together we're 5000+ brains; someone will see or think of something you didn't (or vice versa); use it.
What's the best part about your local Magic community?
All the different personalities, locations, and desires. Yeah, it can be a headache (or a nightmare sometimes) but it's also so interesting to watch these people come together.
What is your favorite non-Magic hobby?
Reading. It used to be Star Wars games but judging has taken my free time…that X-Wing game though is rather pretty….
What is your favorite non-judging moment that happened with other judges?
No one favorite event, but it seems that after local event wrap ups, we end up spending at least three hours in the parking lot “getting ready to leave after this one story.”
What's the biggest rule-breaking play you've ever made as a player?
It wasn't rules-breaking per se because I never let it happen but years ago I was in the finals with a really good friend. I had been drawing nothing but land in a mono blue deck so I just held them. I'm at three life and he goes “Lightning bolt?” to which I respond with “Pay two life and redirect it to your Spellskite” with the only time in my life I didn't crack a smile when lying. I see him thinking “You…you can do that?” It was a full 30 seconds before I smelled the smoke and offered the handshake.
What has been your favorite Magic event that you've judged?
The next one! ;-P The only one that's really sticking out is my first SCG Open which was in DC and that's because we were floor team and at the end of one of the middle rounds, I went to get a table and Jeff Darran was in charge of it. Each judge in front of me got one table; on my turn Jeff gave me three I believe while his partner helping was like “He's a new L1, really?” and Jeff answered with “Truitt can handle it.” I think that was the confidence boost that got me where I am now…
If you could chat with one person, real or fictional, dead or alive, who would it be and why?
Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Besides the whole favorite author thing, his ability to get into the human condition is amazing and to learn from that would be epic.
What would you be doing now if Magic no longer existed?
I really don't know. So many steps have leaded me to this point that I'd just assume if the game stopped tomorrow, the next adventure would be there waiting for me to grab it.
What is the strangest card interaction you have seen in a tournament?
It was a side event Commander game. One player had Timesifter out and someone else played Time Stretch and wanted me to figure out the turns for them. It's the one time I've walked away from a question without giving a decent answer.
How do you have fun during events?
Judging. It is quite fun…but beyond that, I'll usually start doing some weird and small dance just to stay active in the later rounds.
If you were a Planeswalker what would be your ultimate?
“Put an ‘Elspeth, Knight-Errant‘ Planeswalker token into play.” Granted, that might be better than my +1…(along with “Ignore the Planeswalker uniqueness rule”).
Proudest moment of your judge life?
Having judges on my team/event tell me afterward that they appreciated the time I took with them after the event/near the end with giving them feedback and making sure they were taken care of. I <3 my judglings (and full grown judges).
What character in Magic represents you the best, and why?
Elspeth (notice any trend here?). I've always seen her character as asexual (the Daxos romance is not cannon; Xenagos displayed the ability to control minds and I blame the whole “relationship” on that) and her desire to just find some place where she can live happily and in peace speaks volumes to me. Oh and the whole running away when things hit the fan…
Is there anything else you'd like to add?
Judging is a hobby for a game, yeah but in the end, It's about doing the best you can and then doing better. It's about becoming a better person for it and at larger events, it's about doing the best you can for those who didn't get on staff. Always do better.
Two Truths and a Lie
Two of the following statements are true and one is false. Figure out which!
1.- I can speak (all very rusty though) Spanish, German, and Russian.
2.- As a Star Wars fan, I enjoy the Prequel movies.
3.- I believe a Russian Elspeth Tirel does not exist (as it's the only Russian PW I'm missing).
The answer to the last Two Truths and a Lie...
Many thanks for those awesome judge moments, David.
For all the other judges, keep on sending more judge stories, we appreciate being able to give recognition to judges all over the world, nominate a judge today!
It will be another night at the Calgary Remand Centre for the man police have charged in connection with the theft of two expensive trees outside a Beltline restaurant.
Ryan Leslie Duguay appeared briefly in Calgary provincial court Monday after consulting with duty counsel Mark Cluett about his wish to get out of jail.
“Mr. Duguay is wishing to speak to release, but it's a situation where this file has been transferred from upstairs,” Cluett said, of the fact the case was moved from drug court to regular docket court.
He told Judge Brian Stevenson the Crown did not have a duplicate file to transfer to docket court, so prosecutor Tiffany Dwyer wasn't prepared to deal with it.
“Mr. Duguay's anxious to speak to release, he's asking this matter come back (Tuesday),” Cluett said.
Dwyer said there were outstanding charges in Winnipeg complicating the issue of Duguay's release.
He was arrested last Thursday and charged with possession of two stolen Japanese maple trees after two were pilfered from outside the Royale Brasserie restaurant on 17 Ave. S.W.
Surveillance video from the restaurant on Aug. 8, around 3 a.m., showed a man walking his dog and approach the entrance to the eatery.
The man then pulled the trees from their pots before walking off with his dog in tow.
The restaurant at 730 17 Ave. S.W. had staff post the footage on Instagram.
Duguay, 31, also faces charges of possession of marijuana in connection with his arrest, along with four counts of breaching conditions of bail on Winnipeg allegations, including that he reside at an address in the Manitoba city.
He faces 10 criminal charges in Winnipeg, including five of possession of a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking.
Those allegations were also in court Monday and adjourned to Tuesday.

This may come as a surprise but Buick has produced a large sedan that is actually fun to drive.
Unlike its predecessors, the 2017 LaCrosse can make for an entertaining driving companion on a winding country road.
This much became clear on a recent test drive in the Portland, Oregon area, where the LaCrosse tackled demanding back roads with aplomb.
Were Buick owners crying out for a more dynamic LaCrosse? Not exactly. But Jeff Yanssens, chief engineer of the latest LaCrosse, has past generation Corvette-engineering blood in his veins. And he was not about to build an old-school Buick that wallowed through the turns like a boat.
Also on Forbes:
That's not to say Yanssens has turned the LaCrosse into a BMW 5 Series fighter, but he has put some daylight between the Buick and its primary rival, the Lexus ES350.
This competitive advantage is not just evident in terms of crisp handling and steering response, but also engine smoothness, lack of road noise and interior comfort, areas where Lexus has ruled supreme.
Yanssens lists a whole series of steps his team took to ensure the LaCrosse sets a new standard in its class. Key changes include a stronger body structure that is lighter by 300 lbs, a five-link rear suspension system and the widespread use of advanced sound deadening materials.
The LaCrosse comes with a 3.6-liter V-6 producing 310 hp and a strong torque output of 282 lb ft. That power is routed through an eight-speed transmission either to the front wheels or all four.
Buyers need to step up to the 20-inch wheel versions (vs the standard 18 inch rims) to experience the best handling characteristics offered by the LaCrosse. With the 20-inch wheels comes Buick's so-called HiPer strut front suspension, a design which reduces torque steer, as well as an adaptive damping system that tunes out that bounce and float that used to make big Buicks a handful.
Aesthetically the LaCrosse has evolved into a more modern-looking, contemporary sedan, not exactly groundbreaking but elegant enough to turn heads. The same is true inside where the dashboard is now an attractive blend of artful design and well-chosen materials, with a nicely integrated 8-inch screen.
Front seat comfort is excellent and the rear compartment is spacious, if slightly compromised on headroom due to the lower roofline.
All the expected safety and driver convenience systems are either standard or available in the 2017 LaCrosse, including a personal favorite, adaptive cruise control.
The latest Buick flagship starts at $32,990 but quickly climbs well into the 40s, once you select the higher, more desirable trim levels and options.
Even at the higher price point, the LaCrosse remains an attractive option in its class of premium large sedans and nibbles at the heels of some luxury contenders.
The new LaCrosse is part of Buick's ongoing effort to change perceptions of the brand. Molly Peck, Buick marketing director, claims the brand is moving the needle and registering with younger buyers. “Buick is not what you think,” she says. “People think it's older body styles for older people, but it's not.”
Buick plays a vital role in GM's successful Chinese market strategy but bit by bit the brand is also transforming itself on its home soil. And the LaCrosse is another proof point.

Retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis has resigned from the board of the beleaguered Silicon Valley blood-testing company Theranos, according to a person with direct knowledge. Mattis stepped down in December in preparation for a confirmation hearing as President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of defense, the person said.
Theranos referred questions about Mattis's status on its board to the Trump transition team.
“Should Gen. Mattis be confirmed he will resign his positions with all outside entities, as is standard practice,” Trump transition team spokeswoman Alleigh Marre said in an email.
Mattis's name no longer appears on Theranos's Web page listing its board of directors. The Wall Street Journal first reported that Mattis had stepped down from the board.
[Trump's pick for defense secretary went to the mat for the troubled blood-testing company Theranos]
While leading the U.S. Central Command, Mattis met Elizabeth Holmes, the chief executive of Theranos, at a Marine Memorial event in 2011. He became interested in testing the company's rapid, low-volume blood-testing technology in Afghanistan, an innovation that promised to revolutionize the industry.
Emails obtained by The Post through Freedom of Information Act revealed that, in the years before he joined the company's board, Mattis pushed for the military to test Theranos's technology in the field.
“I've met with my various folks and we're kicking this into overdrive to try to field your lab in the near term,” Mattis wrote to Holmes in June 2012. “Please don't hesitate to call me or to send an email if you sense that we need to talk.”
Ultimately, experts within the military flagged concerns about the company's regulatory strategy. Holmes complained in an email to Mattis that a military official had misrepresented information about her company to regulators and asked him to intervene. Mattis met with representatives of the military and the Food and Drug Administration, who explained the compliance problems with Theranos's approach. The Afghanistan field test never happened.
Shortly after he retired from the military in 2013, Mattis joined Theranos's board of directors.
He remained on the board as the company, a Silicon Valley darling, fell from grace after regulators uncovered a slew of problems. In 2015, the company stopped using its proprietary finger prick tests for all but one of its blood tests. The Food and Drug Administration found that its “nanotainers” used to collect blood were unapproved medical devices. Last year, federal regulators uncovered a slew of problems at the company's Newark, Calif., laboratory and imposed sanctions on the company and on Holmes, who has been banned from owning or operating a laboratory for two years. The company is appealing that decision. However, in a major blow, Walgreens announced it would terminate its partnership with the company last year. In October, Theranos announced it would lay off 340 employees and shutter its clinical labs and wellness centers.
Mattis remains on the board of directors of General Dynamics, an aerospace and defense company.

San Antonio's Rackspace responds to rumors it's slashing staff Rackspace confirms it will reassign about 90 people

Rackspace Hosting Inc. is realigning some of its staff in a move that will reassign about 90 people to more “customer-impacting” roles and eliminate around 10 positions, the company confirmed Monday.
The cloud storage service company tried to tamp down rumors of layoffs that have swirled on social media sites like Reddit, Glassdoor, and thelayoff.com.
About 86 out of the 6,500 employed at the company's Windcrest “Castle” were given the chance to reapply for new positions within Rackspace, said Rob La Gesse, Rackspace's vice president of social strategy.
“They were not job eliminations, nobody got fired,” La Gesse said. “We just need to refocus on different technologies ... We just gave some Rackers an opportunity to find a new position within the company.”
He said most of the new positions would be in “roles that were more customer impacting.”
“At the end of the day, I think it's like eight to 10 people who may lose their job,” La Gesse said.
San Antonio's largest publicly traded tech company has lost a lot of lustre lately amid competition in the cloud computing market that in 2015 sent share prices plunging 64 percent. It's fourth-quarter earnings, announced Feb. 16, showed profits down 13 percent during the final three months of 2015.
RELATED: Rackspace profits tumble 13.2 percent.
A mass layoff based on trouble meeting payroll would be bad news for Rackspace on a lot of levels, such as jeopardizing tax incentives, something the company reported as a risk factor in its annual report released Friday.
The company got $14 million in state enterprise funds in 2007 as well as tax incentives from the city of Windcrest, city of San Antonio, and Bexar County, all of which are dependent on meeting commitments to employ a certain number of people at certain salaries.
“It would affect our entire lease at the Castle,” La Gesse said. “This is nothing like that, absolutely nothing like that.”
CLOSE The National Park Service has identified 3 parks that could receive money from President Trump's salary, all being civil or revolutionary war battlegrounds. Josh King has the story (@abridgetoland). Buzz60

WASHINGTON — The National Park Service has identified projects in three national parks — all Civil War or Revolutionary War battlefields — that could receive money donated back to the government from President Trump's presidential salary.
At the top of the list are two restoration projects at the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, both of which would cost about $78,000 — almost exactly the amount Trump donated from his first three months of his salary as president.
The National Park Service says no final decision has been made. But records obtained by USA TODAY under the Freedom of Information Act show how the agency scrambled to quickly find suitable projects after the president's surprise donation, with the well-visited Chickamauga and Chattanooga quickly rising to the top of the list. The park, which straddles the Georgia and Tennessee border, saw more than 1 million visitors last year.
The records also suggest that Trump intends to deduct his donation from his federal income taxes.
In a letter accompanying the check, Trump attorney Sherri Dillon directed that it be used for "exclusively public purposes." That's a key condition under the Internal Revenue Code for donations to government entities to be tax deductible. And in its acknowledgement of the gift, the National Park Service confirmed that "no goods or services were received in exchange" for his donation — another condition for a tax deduction.

(Photo11: Mark Wilson, Getty Images)
Trump did not direct that his first quarter's salary be used for any particular park, but Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke quickly settled on a battlefield. "We're about $100 or $229 million behind in deferred maintenance on our battlefields alone, and that's on our 25 national battlefields," he said at an April 3 ceremony in the White House briefing room.
Park Service records show Zinke's office was most interested in projects at the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park. Dedicated five years before Gettysburg, it's the nation's oldest battlefield park.
The two projects identified for possible funding are the repair of a section of the Point Park trail, which is threatened by erosion, or to restore the Ochs Museum, built in 1938 at the northernmost point of the Lookout Mountain Battlefield.
Also evaluated for possible funding were monuments at Vicksburg National Military Park in Mississippi and Kings Mountain National Military Park in South Carolina.
Trump's donation appeared to catch the Park Service off guard, with accountants wondering whether Trump's check might have been lost in the mail.
The check used in the White House presentation had an outdated address printed on it, and the accountants were worried the check might have gone to a Reston, Va. post office box the agency hadn't used in 17 years.
The check was eventually deposited in a National Park Service account on April 17, the records confirm.

A FORMER KGB spy chief suspected of helping Brit spook Christopher Steele compile the Donald Trump ‘dirty dossier' has been found dead in mysterious circumstances.
The Sun reports that Oleg Erovinkin, described as a key source behind the widely discredited document, was found dead in the back of his car in Moscow on Boxing Day.
Media reports in Russia suggest his death was the result of foul play, reports the Telegraph.
A former general in the intelligence agency the KBG and its successor the FSB, Erovinkin was reportedly a key aide to former deputy prime minister Igor Sechin.
Erovinkin acted as a ‘go-between' for Russian Presdident Vladimir Putin and Mr Sechin who is now head of the state-owned oil company Rosneft, it has been reported.
Mr Sechin was named several times in the dossier which contained lurid and unverified allegations against US President Donald Trump.
Former MI6 spy Steele reportedly claimed that he had a source close to Mr Sechin in an intelligence report from July last year.
Erovinkin's death has prompted speculation that it was linked to the sensational document, reports the Telegraph.
Russian news agency RIA Novosti news agency reports his body was “found in a black Lexus … a large-scale investigation has been commenced in the area.
“Erovinkin's body was sent to the FSB morgue”.
While no cause of death has been confirmed, some reports have claimed he died as a result of a heart attack.
Christo Grozev, an expert in Russian espionage, writes in his blog that he believes Erovinkin was the key source in Steele's dossier.
He also claims he has “no doubt” that Mr Putin would have had the document on his desk at the time of Erovinkin's death.
Steele, 52, is still in hiding after being revealed as the author of the explosive dossier which was published in full by Buzzfeed earlier this month.
The former spook was reportedly hired by a US political research firm to investigate Mr Trump on behalf of ‘unidentified Republicans' who wanted to derail his White House bid.
He then allegedly wrote a 35-page report consisting of memos compiled before and after the November 8 election — which was later partly funded by Democrats as well as the anti-Trump Republicans.
A furious Mr Trump let rip at his first press conference since his shock election victory, slamming the dossier as “fake”.
Father-of-four Steele reportedly fled his £1.4 million ($2.3 million) Surrey mansion “fearing for his life” after giving his pet cat to his neighbour.

I am a monster, a hybrid, a construction, a bio-hacked assemblage, a coming-together-of-parts, a body without organs, a realization, a far-off dream. My body is a mismatch. My brain is an amalgamation of many intersecting contradictions. I am a monster – hear me bellow, listen to me pull myself apart and put myself back together again. My identity is fractured. My self-knowledge is clouded. I am a wolf-pack, a multitude, a colony. I am a refusal, an unregulated biomass, a gender terrorist. I am not a person – I am a becoming, a process, a field, a flow of atoms. I am monstrous star stuff.
My only stability is my desire for change, my desire to become someone (whoops – I mean “something“) I am not, a desire to evolve, mutate, and self-assemble. I refuse to be comforted by the soft glow of identity. I don't want to be a subject – I want to be a force, a physical manifestation of quantum reality. My brain is continuously devouring itself, recreating itself in a new image. My brain sends feelers out into the world to touch what it is not, to gather information about the reality I crave to inhabit. These tentacles also reach back into myself, creating an infinite hallway of mirrors, a blackhole of subjectivity that keeps turning in on itself, warping itself into a field of potential.
Monster politics seeks to destroy the integrity of the human body. Technology is our saviour. Monster politics seeks to destabilize the metaphysics of gender. Gender cannot save us – we must escape from it at maximum velocity. Not everyone is a monster, not everyone wants to be a monster. But monsters feed off the fear of not wanting to be a monster. It is the fuel which drives us to be even more hideous, to cast off the shackles of evolution to become cyborgs, beings that transcend the mere human.
The hormones flowing inside my body are not produced within my body. They are products of technogender bio-hacking. These hormones are right now as I write this working to deconstruct and reconstruct my insides, turning me ever more into a monster.
The problem with monsters is that everyone thinks they are ugly. But on the contrary, monsters are beautiful creatures. Monsters inhabit the part of reality that no one else can. We inhabit the liminal spaces, the in-between-ness, the dimensions that exist outside of the comforting confines of the gender binary. My gender is a mess. It cannot be reconciled with the old transsexual narrative of being a woman trapped in a man's body. I am a monster trapped in a non-monstrous body. I am a contradiction imprisoned inside a stable field of containment. I am taking hormones to shatter the prison cell, to escape from normalcy. I am experimenting on my body not because I am in the “wrong body” but because I aim to see just how far my body can change. I want to push my body to its extreme hormonal limits. I want to unleash the biological creativity lurking inside all my cells.
The traditional explanation of transgenderism is that I am “uncomfortable in my body”. My explanation is that my body is not enough for me. It just doesn't cut it. Discomfort is a watered down way of saying that I want to become a monster, a hybrid, a field of intersecting biological contradictions.My body cannot be reduced to a single category. My body refuses easy definitions. My body is an act of terrorism. It strikes terror in the hearts of those who cannot see the body for what it is: a field of potential, a virtual hyper-space of biological possibility.
I am a monster. But that does not define me. Monster politics recognizes that monstrosity itself is monstrous, it cannot be contained within easy conceptual organizations. And don't tell me I am not a monster. Don't tell me I am pure and whole. Don't tell me because I won't believe you. The wolf-pack inside me will not listen – it will simply attempt to devour you.

Data centres will consume up to 20pc of all electricity generated in the State within a decade, which will pose an enormous challenge for Ireland meeting its climate change targets.
Data centres will consume up to 20pc of all electricity generated in the State within a decade, which will pose an enormous challenge for Ireland meeting its climate change targets.
The amount of power needed to store emails, texts and other online data could rise seven-fold as Ireland chases inward investment from tech giants including Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft, data from EirGrid shows.
The national grid operator says that data centres could account for 75pc of new demand by 2030, and that the grid will have to be bolstered - particularly in Dublin - to meet projected growth, which could require additional power generation.
"Large industrial connections normally do not dominate a country's energy demand forecast but this is the case for Ireland at the moment," the All-Island Generation Capacity Statement 2017-2026 says.
It adds that conventional generation capacity is falling as older plants are due to shut down over the coming years.
While the amount of renewables being added to the system is increasing, capacity in Dublin is on a knife edge.

The IDA is actively encouraging firms to develop data centres, and appointed an engineering firm over the summer to identify at least six strategic sites with grid access across the country.
Critics point to the fact that while jobs are generated during construction, relatively few full-time positions are available once they are completed.
This week, the Commercial Court ruled that a €850m data centre proposed by Apple in Athenry, Co Galway, could go ahead following a lengthy planning and legal appeal. Up to 150 full-time jobs will be created on completion.
At full capacity, the first phase of the plant will use some 30MW of power, the equivalent use of almost 26,000 homes. Over time, this will rise to 240MW.
Despite the climate impacts arising from generating this enormous quantity of power, there is still no Government policy in place setting out the most suitable locations, the jobs potential and environmental impact of data centres.
The Commercial Court noted that there was no national climate change policy regarding high energy consuming projects such as data centres, but it is understood the cabinet will discuss developing policies on Tuesday.
The Department of Justice and Attorney General are also considering what structures are required to avoid the delays as occurred in the Apple case. It is not clear if climate impacts will be addressed.
And while sources suggest the Government is keen to promote Ireland as being a location where it can meet the needs of the IT sector by providing certainty around planning and power supply, not all ministers are convinced. There are concerns about emissions from power generation, as well as potential issues in relation to fuel poverty and impact on energy bills for consumers, coupled with the cost of grid upgrades.
Analysis from EirGrid shows that data centres already connected to the grid consume 250MW of electricity, sufficient to power more than 210,000 homes.
Another 550MW is due to be connected over the coming years, enough for almost 470,000 houses, while projects under discussion could consume as much as 1,000MW - enough for 850,000 homes.
"If all of these enquiries were to connect, the data centre load could account for 20pc of all-island peak demand," it says in its ten-year transmission forecast statement.
"Clearly the potential connection of demand on this scale is equivalent to decades of national demand growth," the statement adds.
Massive investment in sub-stations and other infrastructure - particularly around Dublin - will be required, sources said.
The level of proposed connections is highest in north Dublin, and there is "limited additional network capacity" available to meet demand.
Measures such as encouraging some industry to power down during periods of high demand could be used.
"If these connections materialise, new large-scale generation, transmission solutions, demand side response and/or storage will be required in the Dublin area to accommodated further demand increases and ensure continued security of supply," EirGrid says.
Line refurbishments and upgrades, coupled with construction of new sub-stations and additional generation are likely to be required in the capital.
Sources suggest the cost of upgrading the network could run into tens of millions of euros, which will largely be met through connection and annual fees which cover power bills and the cost of upgrades and maintenance.

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said Monday he was satisfied with the achievements of an international conference that raised billions of dollars to rehabilitate the Gaza Strip, and also stipulated that demilitarization of the coastal enclave is dependent on internal Palestinian elections.
Speaking after the Sunday conference that secured some $5.4 billion in foreign aid for the Palestinians, Abbas described the event as a “great success,” Israel Radio reported on Monday.
The Palestinian leader made it clear that the funds, of which $2.7 billion are intended to rebuild war-torn Gaza, will go straight to the PA and not to any other Palestinian groups.

Abbas told Egyptian reporters that he does not expect Hamas to launch another conflict with Israel because the organization doesn't have the ability to do so. He also suggested that the demilitarization of Gaza, which has been a key demand of Israel, will only happen after the planned general elections for a new Palestinian government, although a date for the vote has not yet been set.
Abbas added that only elections can unite Palestinian military power under one authority and resolve the issue of multiple militias.
Israel Radio reported that a senior member of the Palestinian terror group Islamic Jihad, Khaled al-Batsh, said on Sunday that the rehabilitation and opening of the border crossings are a condition for continuing the ceasefire with Israel.
At the conference, Qatar pledged $1 billion toward the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, once again using its vast oil wealth to reinforce its role as a regional player. Gulf Arab rival the United Arab Emirates promised $200 million.
The pledges followed US Secretary of State John Kerry earlier announcing immediate American assistance of $212 million. The European Union pledged €450 million ($568 million), while Turkey, which has been playing a growing role in the region in recent years, said it would donate $200 million.
The latest conflict in Gaza killed more than 2,000 Palestinians — mostly civilians, according to Gaza-based UN sources. Another 11,000 were wounded, and some 100,000 people reportedly remain homeless. Israel says some 1,000 of the fatalities were Hamas and other gunmen, and blames Hamas for the civilian casualties, arguing that it launched rockets at Israeli towns from within residential areas.
Hamas and other terror groups fired over 4,500 rockets and other projectiles at Israel, and staged several attacks through cross-border tunnels, prompting Israel to launch Operation Protective Edge that continued for 50 days during July and August. Seventy-two Israelis were killed in the fighting. Israel and Hamas eventually agreed to an extended ceasefire conditioned on further negotiations for a more permanent arrangement in which the Palestinians want an easing of Israel's blockade of Gaza, and Israel wants Hamas to give up its arms.

The Izhmash gun plant has presented its new sniper rifle VS-121 designed in a bullpup configuration. Based on the classic Dragunov model and upgraded with modern design features, it is to become a ‘principally new' Russian-made sniper rifle.
The new rifle is fitted with an up-to-date trigger and firing mechanism, and is compatible with 7.62×54mm and 7.62×51mm shells, as well as with “advanced new ammunition currently developed by the Izhmash design-engineering center specialists,” the statement issued by the Izhevsk Machinebuilding Plant (Izhmash) said on Monday.
The VS-121 rifle comes with improved action, and is equipped with suppressor and Picatinny rail for mounting various optoelectronic devices. According to Izhmash's Chief Designer Vladimir Zlobin, the new rifle is “compact and light,” its weight being 4.5kg. It is currently undergoing comprehensive factory tests.
The bullpup design is the new rifle's prominent feature. Placing the gun's action and magazine behind the trigger permits a shorter firearm length without the need of shortening the barrel and improves weapon's maneuverability. It is particularly popular with special task forces, which are major clients of Izhmash in Russia.
Although bullpup modifications are not something new for Russian firearms, and include already employed Dragunov sniper rifle model SVU, it is the first time the world-famous AK-47 assault rifle manufacturer has stepped aside from conventional firearm design. The latest incarnation of the iconic Kalashnikov rifle – AK-12 – has been designed in a classic AK-47 layout, and is about to undergo official state tests in June.
Founded in 1807, Izhmash is Russia's leading maker of assault and sniper rifles, cannon-launched guided projectiles, as well as sporting guns and machine-tools. The plant exports its produce to 27 world countries, including the USA, the UK, and Germany.
In the latest of a string of copycat crimes following the criminal in New Mexico who broke into actor Bryan Cranston's car and stole a script for his hit drama “Breaking Bad,” a thief in Burbank this morning broke into a car belonging to a staff writer on the CW's “The Carrie Diaries,” and stole a copy of the show's season finale, only to return it hours later with extensive notes.
(From the pages of the April 9 issue of Variety.)
According to the thief, 28-year-old Edgar Santos, like most of America, he wasn't even aware there was a series prequel to “Sex and the City” currently on television when he broke into the car belonging to “Carrie Diaries” staff writer, Kirk Malloy.
“After reading the episode's mediocre dialogue and plot, I decided that maybe I should stop breaking into people's cars and try my hand as a television writer,” Santos told Hollywood & Swine from his cell at L.A. County Jail, where he's currently residing following his arrest. “Unfortunately I learned after reading the most recent Writers Guild reports that there was a better chance of me stealing a good script for ‘The Carrie Diaries' than there would be for a minority writer to land a staff job on a television show.”
Producers of “The Carrie Diaries” admitted they were impressed by Santos' notes and are considering offering him a job as a writer's assistant. Among the tasks he'd be required to perform include taking notes during story meetings, getting coffee and, most importantly, keeping an eye on writers' cars so thieves don't break into them.
Upon learning of Santos breaking into his car and then returning the stolen script, “The Carrie Diaries” staff writer Malloy said, “As I writer I can handle people breaking into my car and stealing my stuff. But the only thing that really pisses me off is when people give me notes.”
An undergraduate researcher at the University of Wisconsin–Madison has gained national acclaim for her research showing, she says, that members of minority groups feel oppressed by standard, grammatical English.
The researcher is Erika Gallagher, reports The Daily Cardinal, the student newspaper on the taxpayer-funded campus.
Gallagher's research was chosen to be presented at the Collegiate Conference on Composition and Communication in Portland, Oregon earlier this semester.
UW-Madison student earns national attention for her work to erase the stigma against Ebonics. https://t.co/7fJiGxFcdH pic.twitter.com/GVZdxm6yNp — The Daily Cardinal (@dailycardinal) April 6, 2017
The focus of the junior's research is a theory called “code switching.” Basically, adherents of “code switching” say that individuals will seek to alter their speech patterns to fit the group of people with which they are communicating. (RELATED: ‘Ma Lips Ah Sealed!' Hillary Uses Black Accent In Chat With Sharpton)
Members of minority groups feel especially marginalized because of “code switching,” Gallagher's research found.
To avoid any hurt feelings some people may feel by attempting to speak standard, correct English, Gallagher wants to eradicate the stigma associated with Ebonics — or African–American Vernacular English, a nonstandard dialect of English spoken by some black people.
“I want to center the voices of the people who need to be centered,” Gallagher, a participant in the UW-Madison writing fellows program, told The Daily Cardinal. “As a white-passing person, I have a lot of power and privilege that should be shared.”
Ultimately, she explained, she wants to expand her research and eventually create a nonprofit group which urges teachers across the United States “to be more accepting” and to present their classes with disclaimers urging students to speak using the language which makes the students most comfortable.
Gallagher said her experience as a writing fellow, which involves helping other students improve their writing abilities, led her to believe that a focus on details such as proper English grammar causes minority students to feel excluded.
The social welfare major's acclaimed research involved talking at length with three minority students about how they perceive language. Using standard English as “the biggest form of cognitive dissonance that exists,” one of the students said.
“Just because you speak a different way doesn't mean you're not smart,” Gallagher told the Cardinal.
Gallagher is a Posse scholar at UW-Madison. The Posse scholar program “identifies public high school students with extraordinary academic and leadership potential who may be overlooked by traditional college selection processes.”
According to her Facebook page, Gallagher has also been the lead camp counselor at Burgundy Farm Country Day School, “a nurturing environment that engages the whole child” where a year of junior kindergarten costs $26,934 and a year of sixth grade costs $30,814.
Gallagher's Facebook likes include Bernie Sanders, the International Socialist Organization of Madison and, of course, Colin Kaepernick.

Story highlights "I underestimated how difficult it would be," Davis says
The filibuster of Texas Sen. Wendy Davis became a viral sensation
The White House took notice of her abortion rights stand
Critics say the bill would have shut most of the state's abortion clinics
A day after a filibuster and a raucous crowd in the state Capitol foiled passage of a bill that would have imposed strict new regulations on abortion in Texas, Gov. Rick Perry vowed Wednesday to try again.
Perry said the Legislature would convene July 1 in special session to take up the abortion bill, which was declared dead before dawn Wednesday. The bill failed after a night of drama in Austin during which a lone lawmaker talked for more than 10 hours in an attempt to run out the clock on a special session.
Chants of "shame! shame! shame!" from spectators who had filled the building drowned out the efforts of Republican lawmakers as they tried to pass it minutes before midnight.
"We will not allow the breakdown of decorum and decency to prevent us from doing what the people of this state hired us to do," Perry said in a statement calling lawmakers back into another special session. Texans "value life and want to protect women and the unborn," he said.
Perry's announcement came a day before he was to address the National Right to Life convention in Dallas on Thursday.
And it came on a day when abortion rights advocates found a new hero in state Sen. Wendy Davis , D-Fort Worth.
Though Republicans control the state Senate, Davis tried to block the abortion bill by attempting a 13-hour filibuster Tuesday.

"I underestimated how difficult it would be -- both physically and mentally," Davis told CNN's "AC360" on Wednesday. "About two hours in, I realized I was in for a long day. My back started hurting pretty early on and began to really hurt as the hours ticked by."
But, she said, the energy from the packed gallery "kept me going throughout the day."
Davis fell short of her goal by less than three hours when the chair ruled she had gone off topic. The gallery erupted in boos. Her fellow Democrats stalled for time with procedural tactics.
And as the clock wound down, opponents of the bill drowned out proceedings on the floor, preventing lawmakers from completing a vote in time to get it passed.
At 3 a.m., Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst stepped to the Senate floor to declare the bill dead and the special session over.
"We empowered the voice of people in Texas and people who wanted to stand against this intrusion, this big government intrusion, into their personal lives," Davis said Wednesday night.
Even if the bill winds up passing in the next special session, the reaction will not be split along partisan lines, she predicted. "It's a reaction coming from Republicans, independents and Democrats alike, which is saying: Governor Perry, Lieutenant Governor Dewhurst, stay out of my private decision-making."
The bill would have banned most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and tightened standards on abortion clinics and the doctors who work at them. Critics said the measure would have shut most of the abortion clinics in Texas.
"He (Perry) lost this fight in regular session, and even after they broke the rules he and his allies lost again in front of the entire country last night," said Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in a statement.
"They tried every trick in the book, blocking testimony from the very women whose lives would be affected, voting in the middle of the night, shutting down the debate — they couldn't get this done because Texans would not let them."
Wearing pink sneakers, Davis, 50, took to the floor of the chamber late Tuesday morning to criticize the bill. Rules called for her to stand, unaided, until midnight, for the filibuster to succeed.
She was not allowed to sit down, lean or take a bathroom break, and she was allowed three warnings before the Senate was to be allowed to vote on whether to stop the filibuster.
The senator spent much of the time reading testimony and messages from women decrying the bill and recounting the struggles they, their friends or relatives faced before birth control and abortion were legalized.
"Women realize that these bills will not protect their health," she said. "They will only reduce their access to abortion providers and limit their ability to make their own family-planning decisions."
Early in the diatribe, her comments were ruled off topic and she was given her first warning.
During the evening, a fellow senator helped Davis put on a back brace, which was ruled to have violated filibuster rules, and she got her second warning.
Finally, at about 10 p.m., Davis talked about the abortion pill, RU486, and the chairman ruled again that her comments were off topic.
But a member of the Senate then moved that the ruling be appealed, and its status was in doubt.
The final hours of the session were marked by confusing parliamentary maneuvers until Sen. Leticia Van de Putte stepped to the microphone, ending the debate.
"At what point must a female senator raise her hand or her voice to be recognized over the male colleagues in the room?" the Democratic senator asked after she had been ignored.
At 15 minutes before midnight, the gallery erupted in applause and chants of "Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!"
As the session ended, Davis waded into the crowd of supporters and praised them as "the people who truly made this happen."
Texas Right to Life blamed "the angry mob of protesters in the Senate gallery" for the failure of the bill to pass.
"Ultimately, we should be encouraged that we had the votes and that so many came to support the bill," the anti-abortion group said on its website . "We will continue to work to pass Pro-Life legislation that protects women and saves lives in Texas."
The last stand
Davis' stand captivated abortion rights advocates from coast to coast, prompting the hashtag #standwithwendy on Twitter
The White House took notice.
"Something special is happening in Austin tonight," said a post on President Barack Obama's official Twitter account . The account is run by Organizing for Action, a nonprofit group established to support the president's legislative agenda.
"Whatever the outcome, @WendyDavisTexas efforts entered her into the pantheon of American heroes tonight."
Heady times for Davis, who was first elected to the Texas Senate in 2008, defeating a longtime Republican incumbent to do so.
Last year, she staged a filibuster to force a special session in an attempt to stop $5 billion in cuts to Texas public schools, according to her website
Davis, who became a single mother at age 19, went on to graduate with honors from Harvard Law School, it says.
Her filibuster was no record. In 1977, Sen. Bill Meier staged a 43-hour marathon.
The special session ends with irony, Twitter user Cody Beckner said, echoing the governor's own words.
It's not just Schock's own Instagram account that betrayed his actions to the public, though. One of his aides once posted on his IG that the lawmaker took him and the other interns to a sold-out Katy Perry concert. The politician billed those tickets against the GOP's Generation Y Fund -- a fund his office has donated $1.5 million to since he was elected in 2009. His Instagram shenanigans have recently led to even more probing by various outlets, including Politico, which looked into his mileage expenses. The publication discovered that Schock billed his office more than twice the mileage he'd actually driven.
Speaking to Chicago Tribune, Senator Dick Durbin said these charges and allegations "have raised important questions about Shock's expenditure of campaign funds and official funds." The senator also admitted that the Illinois representative's "resignation suggests that many of the allegations had substance behind them."
Here is Aaron Schock's full statement (emphasis ours):
Today, I am announcing my resignation as a Member of the United States House of Representatives effective March 31st. I do this with a heavy heart. Serving the people of the 18th District is the highest and greatest honor I have had in my life. I thank them for their faith in electing me and letting me represent their interests in Washington. I have given them my all over the last six years. I have traveled to all corners of the District to meet with the people I've been fortunate to be able to call my friends and neighbors. But the constant questions over the last six weeks have proven a great distraction that has made it too difficult for me to serve the people of the 18th District with the high standards that they deserve and which I have set for myself. I have always sought to do what's best for my constituents and I thank them for the opportunity to serve.
The former lawmaker has already made his Instagram account private, so you unfortunately can't see his photos anymore. ABC News has a list of his high-profile celebrity meetings and trips, at least, if you want to get a taste of what he used to post.

We are still 32 weeks away from kickoff of the Florida Gators 2016 football season, but it's never too early to think about the prospects of the Gators accomplishing another successful football season. Florida will be without a few key parts, but the schedule sets up nice for the Gators to make another run at the SEC East. This season will play out in what are true toss up games against Tennessee, LSU, Georgia, Arkansas and Florida State. Florida could win or lose any of those games. The quarterback position will be better than what we saw the last eight games of the year. The defense loses some key components but they return enough to field one of the top defenses in the country. The Gators will field a competitive team once again.
September 3rd – UMass Minutemen (2015 record: 3-9)
This is an important opening game for the Gators because they do not have the next game to make first game mistakes. Last year they had a great start against New Mexico State and got complacent against East Carolina. Gators will do the typical first game thing and win this one going away.
September 10th – Kentucky Wildcats (2015 record: 5-7)
Last year in Lexington the Wildcats had all the hope in the world to end the 29 game losing streak to the Gators. Mark Stoops may be on the firing line next year and needs this win to hush some of the doubters. Unfortunately this game is in Gainesville and I fully expect the streak to reach 30.
September 17th – North Texas Mean Green (2015 record: 1-11)
The Mean Green will be a good game to correct things following Kentucky and to continue to get better to prepare for their first road game against Tennessee. This will be another run away and the Gators will be setting for one of the biggest league games early in the season that will shape the race in the East for the remainder of the year.
September 24th – at Tennessee Volunteers (2015 record: 9-4)
On the last weekend in September the Gators travel to Knoxville for a stiff test against an experienced Tennessee roster. Joshua Dobbs returns along with running back Jalen Hurd. This is a big game for the SEC East title as Tennessee looks to end an 11 game losing streak to Florida. This game begins a brutal four game stretch for the Vols that has consecutive games against Florida, at Georgia, at Texas A&M and closing at home against Alabama. Right now I think this is the year Tennessee finally ends the streak, but we have seen more sure fire wins become losses for the Vols in the past.
October 1st – at Vanderbilt Commodores (2015 record: 4-8)
Vanderbilt almost pulled off the SEC shocker of the year last season losing to the Gators 9-7. Derek Mason did a good job improving the Commodores and making them more competitive. He will continue to do that behind junior running back Ralph Webb and a stingy defense. That still won't be enough to beat the Gators though.
October 8th – LSU Tigers (2015 record: 9-3)
The Tigers will travel to Gainesville looking to extend their winning streak over the Gators to four. Last year in Baton Rouge Les Miles pulled off some more magic with a fake field goal to beat the Gators. This game will most likely once again come down to a play here or there. Leonard Fournette returns with a tough LSU offense looking to regain the national prominence from past years. This will be a hot seat year for Miles, but the Tigers will walk away with a win over the Gators in Gainesville.
October 15th – Missouri Tigers (2015 record: 5-7)
Towards the end of last year the Tigers were a complete train wreck. New coach Barry Odom has been chosen to follow-up Missouri legendary coach Gary Pinkel, which will not be an easy task. The offense for Missouri was abysmal and if they want to not challenge for the bottom spot in the east they will need to show marked improvement. The last two years against the Gators have not been pretty for the Missouri offense and this game will not be any different. Gators get a solid win at home against the Tigers.
October 29th – vs Georgia Bulldogs (2015 record: 10-3)
Kirby Smart will be a new face on the Georgia sidelines in Jacksonville for the first time in 15 years. He will be looking to get the Bulldogs to the next level of winning championships. That will start by beating the rival Gators. The Bulldogs could be starting highly touted true freshman Jacob Eason but will have All-American running back Nick Chubb back in the fold. This game is absolutely a toss-up. I'll give the Gators the benefit of the doubt here and look for them to make three in a row versus the Bulldogs.
November 5th – at Arkansas Razorbacks (2015 record: 8-5)
This will be an extremely tough game for the Gators going on the road to Fayetteville. Recently, plenty of teams have struggled to come away with a win. Brett Bielema is still trying to get Arkansas to that next tier in the SEC but he will be losing quarterback Brandon Allen to graduation and running back Alex Collins to early entry to the NFL. The Razorbacks will be a formidable test and the Gators will come away with a very close loss on the road. A loss here would not be surprising and depending on how the Gators are playing they are more than capable of winning this game.
November 12th – South Carolina Gamecocks (2015 record: 3-9)
Of all the home games on the schedule this will be the most interesting for the mere fact that we are one year removed from the Will Muschamp era at Florida and he is coming back to the Swamp. Unfortunately for Muschamp and the Gamecocks, the same issues he had at Florida offensively, will be the same issues at this time in South Carolina. Gators will roll in Muschamp first game as the opposing head coach in the Swamp.
November 19th – Presbyterian Blue Hose (2015 record: 2-9)
Presbyterian will roll in for Senior Day and roll out with a beat down. This will not be like the FAU game from last year. The Gators will bring more offense to the table and roll over the Blue Hose. If you are interested in what a Blue Hose is click here.
November 26th – at Florida State (2015 record: 10-3)
The Gators will travel up Tallahassee for the annual battle with the Noles in what should be a tough hard fought rivalry game. The Noles should have settled their potential QB situation by this time, but there team will be all about Dalvin Cook and their defense. The Noles could be in the playoff discussion and the Gators will hope to derail that. Florida State will be too good at home and will walk away with their third straight victory over the Gators.
2016 Record Prediction: 8-4
Best Case Scenario Prediction: 10-2
Worst Case Scenario Prediction: 7-5
THE Electoral Commission is reminding voters they only have a few days left to register if they wish to cast their ballot in next month's Assembly election.
The Commission has said voters must be registered by Monday if they wish to vote in the election on May 5th.
Eligible voters will also be able to cast their ballot at the Brexit referendum, scheduled for June 23rd.
A helpline for voter registration has received almost 10,000 calls in recent weeks, the Electoral Commission has said, while 2,700 forms have been issued by the Electoral Office.
According to the Commission, research carried out last year showed that a quarter of people in the north wrongly believed they could register up until the day of the election.
Facebook has used its network to promote the message, which it also did prior to last May's Westminster election, by sending out reminders via its newsfeed.
Ann Watt, head of the Electoral Commission, said: "Working with Facebook provides a unique opportunity for a huge number of people to see this really important message before the deadline.
"After 18 April, the chance to register to vote in the Northern Ireland Assembly election will have passed. If you aren't registered yet, you should take a few minutes to download and complete an application form from www.aboutmyvote.co.uk."
Theo Lomas from Facebook said: "Over 35 million people in the UK use Facebook, considerably more than the number of people who voted in the last general election."
Conservative commentator and former GOP presidential candidate Pat Buchanan argued this weekend that GOP elites who represent the globalist wing of the party will not attend this year's convention because Donald Trump's insurrection against them on trade, immigration, and foreign policy has succeeded.
When host Michael Smerconish mentioned on his Saturday CNN program that the party's last two Presidents—George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush—and presidential nominees—Mitt Romney and John McCain—will not be attending this year's convention in Cleveland, Buchanan said the reason the elites and the “leadership of the party and the old leadership of the party is not showing up is because Donald Trump, the nominee, is conducting an insurrection against those individuals and against the policy they produced, on trade, immigration and foreign policy.”
“If Donald Trump wins this election, he is going to take the country in a new direction,” he said. “He's running an insurrection against the political, corporate, and media elites in Washington, D.C., and he's running an insurrection against the Republican elites, and he has succeeded.”
Buchanan said the insurrection is “populist, patriotic, ethno-national” and a form of “economic nationalism.”
“And that's not the defining philosophy of the incumbent Republican Party of Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney,” Buchanan added.
Buchanan said “one of the major things that's in the hearts and minds of” of working-class voters “is that we have had it with the political media, corporate elite in the nation's capital, let's go for somebody who will really give us real change. And even though I've got doubts about this fellow Trump, I think that he will do that.”
Buchanan cited the country's decimated manufacturing sector due to bad trade deals and “all of the wars” in the Middle East that the elites have gotten the country into during the last decade. He added that many voters are saying, “I don't know about this fellow Trump, but I think I'm going to vote for him.”
The Bush family, McCain, and Romney are illustrative of Republican elites who have been out of touch not only with the conservative base but the so-called independent “Reagan Democrats” who have decided every election since 1980.
George H.W. Bush, after winning Ronald Reagan's third term, then showed his true establishment colors by turning his back on conservatives by breaking his promise not to raise taxes. He lost his reelection bid to Bill Clinton. George W. Bush took the country into Iraq and tried to pass comprehensive amnesty legislation in addition to pushing through No Child Left Behind. As a result, in addition to numerous K-Street scandals, Republicans lost their majorities in Congress largely due to Bush's presidency.
Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) called social and religious conservative leaders “agents of intolerance” during his 2000 campaign and then saw his projected $100 million campaign implode after he teamed up with the late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA) and George W. Bush to push comprehensive amnesty legislation before his 2008 campaign. McCain, whom conservatives have never considered one of their own, lost the 2008 election to a one-term Senator in Barack Obama even after his selection of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin propelled him to a post-convention lead.
Mitt Romney, one of the most prominent faces of the globalist/corporatist/pale pastels wing of the GOP, also never won the hearts of conservatives even though he vowed that he was “severely” conservative. Romney never resonated with working-class voters who felt disillusioned with Obama. They just could not vote for a robotic candidate who, like the elder Bush, seemed completely out of touch with ordinary Americans, and, as a result, Obama shellacked him in an election in which the so-called metrics were not even on Obama's side. Ryan is the next in line to represent the “Chamber of Commerce” wing of the GOP.
Trump, though he was and is an imperfect candidate, was able to reach GOP primary voters en masse on issues like immigration and trade without being drowned out and blocked by the establishment in ways other candidates without Trump's status, save for Sarah Palin, could never have accomplished. Trump has since clearly defined his battle against Clinton as one between his America-first “Americanism” and Clinton's elites-first “globalism.”
In his interview with Smerconish, Buchanan also said the “nation divided as it has never been divided” and “you've got words like racist, sexist, homophobe” being hurled around on television every day. He said, “We are not one people and one nation the way we were in 1960 under Eisenhower.” Buchanan admitted the country “had some things wrong on the civil rights,” but the country in which he grew up “was a good country, and what these fellows see are the same things I'm seeing: we are losing the best of the country that we grew up in. The government here in Washington, A, is incompetent, B, its system is rigged, and C, we are being pulled away from the center.” He said there are a “a lot of people I run into, I grew up with, who feel exactly the same way” and may vote for Trump even though they have some reservations about him.
1. SILVER AUDIO'S INTERCONNECT SELECTION CRITERIA
Moving up our line of high performance interconnect cables reveals increasingly numerous and thinner, individually insulated pure silver conductors per polarity. This highly functional trend becomes ever more revealing with an increasingly precise sense of image placement, transient speed, and midrange neutrality. The degree of midrange emphasis is the crux of virtually all controversy in high-end audio and is simply a matter of personal preference, not something anyone "has" to like one way or the other! Silver Audio is happy to assist you with honest, system matching advice independent of your budget. If we think our least expensive cable would be most appropriate for your system, we'll tell you!

2. How pure is your silver? (The "ultra-pure hoax revealed")
The shameful practice of claiming ridiculous and completely impossible levels of silver purity by various "high-end" audio cable companies has gone on long enough. Silver Audio formally challenges ANY high-end audio cable company claiming to use greater than 99.99% pure silver to PROVE their claim by making available, a notarized copy of their certification analysis including the name and location of the INDEPENDENT laboratory as well as the type of testing method that was used.
When we demanded proof from our FORMER vendor of their claim (to us) of "five-nines" pure (99.999%) silver, they were unable (and unwilling) to provide it. When another potential vendor claiming "six-nines" pure (99.9999%) stopped communicating with us after we demanded proof from them as well, that was when we became very suspicious that claims of six and even "seven-nines" (and still higher!) were nothing but blatant marketing fraud. In some cases, honest ignorance appears to be the reason behind some claims of ultra-high purity. In most cases however, desperation for a unique selling point is obviously the motivation!
In two years of dealing with scores of the same testing labs that certify metal purity for the aerospace and medical industries (where purity REALLY matters) we find over and over again the same result: There is NO testing method, not even ICP mass spectrometry, and most importantly, no clean room or handling procedure capable of reliably and repeatedly assaying any element beyond 99.99% pure. Even the silicon used in the semi-conductor industry (by some of the most critical and sensitive equipment in the world) cannot be assayed for purity beyond 99.99%! Some audio companies have, perhaps only naively, tested their metal only for gas impurities (oxygen) which is expressed in parts per million (ppm) and apparently tried to then express this figure as a percent of purity (by weight or volume?)! This conversion makes no sense and even if it did, the real contaminants of silver are not oxygen, but the trace elements of iron, copper, phosphorus and silicon!
"Somebody observed this week that you have to go back to the very founding of the government to the first administration of George Washington to find a time when it's taken longer to put a Cabinet in place."
Last month during Trump's Cabinet nomination hearings, Republican Sen. Roy Blunt stood up to deliver his support for the confirmation of Jeff Sessions for U.S. Attorney General. To open his remarks, Blunt pointed out how lengthy the process had become.
"Somebody observed this week that you have to go back to the very founding of the government to the first administration of George Washington to find a time when it's taken longer to put a Cabinet in place," Blunt said.
Blunt's claim was made on Feb. 8, 2017 — just 19 days into Trump's presidency. This seemed like a very short time period to be considered the longest Cabinet appointment process. So we wondered, whose Cabinet took the longest to put in place, and how did Trump compare 19 days in?
The data
A spokesperson for Blunt provided data taken from the Senate Historical Office to back his claim. The data showed every presidential nominee since 1789, their position, the date of their nomination and whether the nominee was confirmed, withdrawn or rejected.
For the purpose of this fact check, we wanted to look at how many days it took after a president was inaugurated for his Cabinet to be completely in place. Part of Blunt's claim deals with how George Washington's Cabinet appointment process was the longest and the only one that took longer than Trump's. So we decided to start there.
The Washington administration
After counting the number of days between a president's first elected term inauguration and the date his Cabinet was in place, we found that Washington did in fact rank as the longest. Even though it only took the Senate a day to confirm most of Washington's nominations, there were still 149 days between the time he was inaugurated and the time his Cabinet was fully in place. Much of this had to do with the fact that the country and its government were so new.
The Top 5
After Washington, Barack Obama had the second-longest Cabinet appointment process. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius was confirmed on April 28, 2009 — 98 days after Obama was inaugurated. It took 42 days from the time Sebelius was nominated till the day she was confirmed. She was also just one of four Obama Cabinet members who took longer than the 19-day benchmark that was set by Blunt's claim.
Following Obama, in the third spot was Lyndon B. Johnson. Johnson became president in 1963 after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so for the purpose of this fact-check, we looked at Johnson's first elected term in 1965. His Cabinet took 64 days to be finalized, with the confirmation of Secretary of the Treasury Henry H. Fowler.
Next is George H.W. Bush, with the fourth-longest Cabinet appointment process. It took 56 days for his Cabinet to be fully in place. Like Obama, four of his nominations also took 19 days or longer to be confirmed. However, one of Bush's appointments for Secretary of Defense, John G. Tower, was rejected by a 47-53 vote on March 9, 1989. Five days later, Bush nominated Dick Cheney, who was then confirmed on March 17, 1989, to complete his Cabinet.
Rounding out the top five of the longest Cabinet appointment processes was Bill Clinton. It took 50 days for Clinton to have his entire Cabinet confirmed, and the process ended with the confirmation of Janet Reno for Attorney General on March 11, 1993. His previous nominee for Attorney General, Zoë E. Baird, withdrew six days after her nomination.
The context
So why do some Cabinet processes taking longer than others then? Paul Light, a professor at NYU Wagner and an expert on the Cabinet appointment process, said it really has to do with each president's preparation beforehand.
"What's unusual is the slowness with which Trump has made nominations," Light said. "Once these nominations are made, the process is just very difficult."
What Light is referring to here is the Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2015. The act gives presidential nominees money, office space and the opportunity to pre-clear potential nominees before they take office. According to Light, Trump did none of this.
"He was starting from scratch the day after the election, and he took many of those weeks after Election Day for a victory tour," Light said.
Light also said the public isn't always aware of what goes on before an announcement of a nomination is even made— a process that can be very lengthy .
"This is a process that is highly constrained by all the questions that have to be answered," Light said. "We hear about all the delays that occur once a candidate is nominated, but we don't hear about the delays in between making the phone call and the official announcement."
During this time frame, potential nominees are subjected to a questionnaire, as well as an ethics test. Light said that in recent years these questionnaires have become much denser.
Once someone is officially nominated, the process isn't just reserved to the Senate confirmation hearing. The FBI compiles a list of all potential problems with nominees. This happens by sending out students in the FBI Academy to speak with people who know the nominee, including neighbors. The FBI then compiles a report that is handed over to the Senate committee chairs.
Where Trump falls
So where does Trump fall in all of this? As of Feb. 8, when Blunt made his claim, six of Trump's nominees had been confirmed, with the last being Jeff Sessions for attorney general. However, the Cabinet confirmation process is still ongoing, so it's hard to tell exactly where Trump will fall when all is said and done. As of March 23, there are two nominees who have yet to be confirmed— Sonny Perdue for Secretary of Agriculture and Alexander Acosta for Secretary of Labor. But at 19 days into his term, Trump technically would fall behind Clinton, who took 50 days to have a complete Cabinet in place.
Our ruling
Blunt said the only Cabinet that took longer to be put in place was that of Washington's, who had the very first in U.S. history.
Blunt made the claim on Feb. 8, 19 days into Trump's presidential term. At PolitiFact, we rate statements based on the information available at the time they were made. And in that context, Blunt is clearly incorrect.
We rate this claim False.
Britons who supported Brexit in last year's referendum on European Union (EU) membership "voted against modern Britain," Hillary Clinton said in an interview published Sunday.
The former U.S. secretary of state told The Sunday Times: "They voted against modern Britain and the EU, believing that somehow this would be good for their small village. It made no sense… The same thing played out in my race, but I didn't think we were so vulnerable. But it turned out we were wrong — in part because the Russians played a much bigger role."
American intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin initially wanted to harm former Democrat presidential nominee Clinton's chances of becoming commander-in-chief, before later explicitly aiding Donald Trump's campaign. Russia has repeatedly denied any meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.
Clinton, who was defeated by Trump in November's general election, told The Times that in hindsight Brexit "should have been a bigger alarm" for her own campaign.

The highway that joins Florencia with San Vicente del Caguán was a war zone until July 20, 2015, when the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) declared a self-imposed unilateral ceasefire. Every few kilometers, Rufino, a taxi driver who works in the Caquetá region, in southeast Colombia, remembers another incident from those war-torn days. “The guerrillas blew up this bridge to hurt the state and while they were at it, they charged [people] for river crossings. It was here that they killed the Turbays [a family of liberal politicians]. They blew up a truck-bomb around that bend.” Over the last few days, 900 journalists have traveled this road en route to the last FARC conference. Rebel leaders will be meeting with soldiers to ratify the peace deal negotiated with the Colombian government in Havana and renounce violence, so that they may begin their transition to becoming a political party.
“We have to make sure peace becomes a reality in our country based on social justice and democracy,” said FARC leader Rodrigo Londoño Echeverri – also known as Timochenko – at the opening ceremony of the conference. “This means connecting the large nonconformist majorities with the active political life of our nation,” added Timochenko, who was unarmed and dressed in civilian clothes.
We have to make sure peace becomes a reality in our country based on social justice and democracy FARC leader Rodrigo Londoño Echeverri
The conference, which runs until September 23, is being held in Llanos del Yarí, a six-hour drive from San Vicente on unpaved roads. In preparation for the meeting, and with the permission of the Colombian government, FARC members set up campsites, makeshift kitchens, offices and tents to host rebel soldiers and visitors. For the first time in 50 years of conflict and after nine conferences, the insurgent group is opening up its congress to the world.
Timochenko and all other members of the FARC Secretariat, the military command of the guerrilla, flew from Cuba to Colombia accompanied by Red Cross International and without any fear of arrest after the Colombian government threw out warrants for their capture. The rest of the group's high- and mid-level commanders faced no challenges at military checkpoints dispersed throughout this mountainous region. FARC members could not travel this freely when they held their first conference in 1965.
Public talks will focus on women and the environment, and the conference will end with a concert
Long gone are the meetings that transformed the Southern Bloc into the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. There is no scheduled talk on military strategy or location of fronts at this year's gathering. Timochenko said the group must send “a new, fresh, and hopeful message for changes,” and urged rebels to seek unity, “without which all effort dissipates and is lost.” Insurgents want to remember their struggle by praising their leaders, the fallen and those whom – like Simón Trinidad, who is currently imprisoned in the United States – they consider martyrs of the movement.
Public talks will focus on women and the environment, and the conference will end with a concert. In a historic declaration of peace, rebels will pledge to put down their arms. And there will be no commemoration for the sixth and seventh conferences, during which the group decided to use kidnappings to finance the movement. Or for many other decisions that sowed pain throughout Colombia.
“Talk to the people in Caquetá,” Rufino says. “They'll tell you that they will vote ‘no' in the referendum.” Colombians will vote in favor or against the peace deal negotiated with rebels in a national referendum on October 2 – the last hurdle to bringing an end to Latin America's longest armed conflict. “And ask them what they think of those who kidnapped their parents and siblings having seats [in Congress],” he adds. “There is a lot of pain here. If they told us Uribe could be president tomorrow, we would vote for him – even though we know that would mean war. More lead.”

On Oct. 30, a long-quiet FBI Twitter account began releasing a torrent of links to documents on the bureau's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) library server. Among the documents were several from the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private e-mail server and a decade-old investigation into the Clinton Foundation over a pardon given by President Bill Clinton at the end of his term. According to an FBI official, the flood of tweets occurred because of a backlog of updates dating to June. The logjam finally broke when a content management system software patch was installed last week.
William J. Clinton Foundation: This initial release consists of material from the FBI's files related to the Will... https://t.co/Y4nz3aRSmG — FBI Records Vault (@FBIRecordsVault) November 1, 2016
The timing of the releases—which also included documents from the investigation of former CIA director David Patraeus for leaking classified information and links to video surveillance from the 2015 protests in Baltimore—drew speculation from many on Twitter that someone at the FBI was trying to damage the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton in the final weeks before Election Day. In response to an initial inquiry by Ars, the FBI sent the following statement:
The FBI's Records Management Division receives thousands of FOIA requests annually which are processed on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. By law, FOIA materials that have been requested three or more times are posted electronically to the FBI's public reading room shortly after they are processed. Per the standard procedure for FOIA, these materials became available for release and were posted automatically and electronically to the FBI's public reading room in accordance with the law and established procedures.
That, however, did not explain the mass of FOIA document tweets beginning on Oct. 30, which also included a number of seemingly random documents, including files from an investigation into inventor Nikola Tesla. Some news outlets, including the politically liberal site ThinkProgress, reported that the FBI had launched an “internal investigation” into the tweets.
An FBI official told Ars today that the tweets had, in fact, prompted an internal review of procedures, not an actual investigation. The problem was traced back to the software that handles automated Twitter posts within the FBI Vault site's content management system. The documents linked in the Twitter posts that were already queued for posting dated back several months. When the software was updated, the backlog was suddenly, automatically, cleared in a spew of tweets.
Of course, there was also one Trump-related tweet amongst the dump as well:

The characterization of Donald Trump's father in the tweet (“real estate developer and philanthropist”) did nothing to dispel conspiracy theories.
Hot news: The Dems are in a race against reality. Which Dems and which reality will win are the only questions. Unfortunately this is a multiple-choice question and all of the answers are correct.
A, B, C, or all of the above work just as well.
Let's start with the question (A) about the Federal Reserve Bank (Dem), interest rates and the economy.
Yesterday was a great day in the market because easy money is here to stay…and least for a little while. And as long as interest rates stay low, the market goes up…at least for a little while.
There is a growing fight however between the economy and the Fed (Dem) over who really rules the economy.
The Fed—which come on, are really a proxy for Dems these days-- thinks that they can make the market seas rise – or stop rising—just like a certain professor of constitutional law, HA!, who once was spotted a Nobel Prize (Dem) in advance, because his race combined with an election was supposed to trump results.
But eventually we'll have to see what the markets will do without the goosing done by the Fed (Dem).
It's gotten so bad the even that Apostle of Big Government, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), thinks perhaps the reserve banks have gone too far in accommodating the financial markets.
Jose Vinals, the IMF's top financial counselor just warned that “the buildup of certain excesses in financial risk taking” might end badly.
Really?
Hm. Never thought of that outcome.
The risk is that the reserve bank in the United States might unwind quantitative easing or other simulative measures too awkwardly says Vinals.
But come on: When does anything associated with our government (Dem) do THAT?
Speaking of awkward (question B):The guy with Ebola in Dallas died, as do anywhere from 60 to 90 percent of patients with the hemorrhagic disease, despite what Pope Obama (Dem) says about it here in the USA.
As a result the company that makes HAZMAT suits, Lakeland Industries (Stock), is shooting up from $6.00 to over $12 per share.
That makes the Big O Poppa's (Dem) record of creating no jobs but tons of millionaires secure even if he angers guys like George Soros (Billionaire): “We said billionaires, not millionaires! Billionaires with a ‘B'.”
It's Soros' fault though.
Obama (Dem) thinks only about trillions, not millions or billions.
Which brings us to question C: Columbus Day (Holiday).
No, really. Hear me out.
Rather than celebrating history's most famous lost person on Columbus Day (Holiday), Seattle will from now on celebrate “Indigenous People's Day” (Dem). After all, what's so important about an Italian entrepreneur and explorer (Columbus) who managed to single-handedly alter our understanding of the known world? And thus usher in the greatest experiment in human development and freedom since God (GOD) created natural selection?
"This action will allow us to bring into current present day our valuable and rich history, and it's there for future generations to learn," said Fawn Sharp (Dumb), president of the Quinault Indian Nation on the Olympic Peninsula (Redskin), who is also president of the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians (Redskin) according to Fox News.
"Nobody discovered Seattle, Washington (Microsoft)," she said to a round of applause.
So there we have it.
Which thing will government (Dem) screw up worse?
A: Our economy?
B: Our healthcare?
Or C: Our history?
And of course if you answered (D)em or all of the above), congratulations: You're a conservative… (or R, still Republican).
Last week, GOP presidential hopeful Jeb Bush pledged to lift up America's poor by providing them with “hope and aspiration,” rather than seducing them into greater dependency with “free stuff.” In Bush's view, giving unearned financial assistance to low-income households doesn't merely burden the taxpayer — it also exacerbates the very poverty it seeks to relieve. By providing unearned relief in the short term, “government handouts” hurt the poor in the long term by inhibiting their “hopes and aspirations” for self-sufficiency, the former Florida governor explained.
This idea is a foundational premise of the Republican Party's economic philosophy, and it has a certain intuitive appeal: “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day,” goes the old proverb. “Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.” But if that man can't learn to fish, what happens to his children? A new study from the National Bureau of Economic Research led by Randall Akee of UCLA's Luskin School of Public Affairs suggests that, far from inhibiting the aspirations of impoverished children, government handouts may play a vital role in fostering their realization.
There have been plenty of studies showing that investment in early childhood education can improve impoverished children's emotional and behavioral health, and thus their later-life outcomes. But the NBER researchers wanted to see whether similar results could be achieved simply through subsidizing the income of poor families rather than via directed subsidies for food, education, and so forth.
Finding the appropriate conditions for such a study wasn't easy. At present, the U.S. government distributes welfare spending almost exclusively through targeted programs rather than direct cash transfers. Generally, if an American family experiences an increase in overall income, it's the product of improved employment conditions for one or both parents. But the researchers found a perfect exception to this rule on a North Carolinian Native American reservation in the Great Smoky Mountains.
Back in the early 1990s, each adult member of the reservation started receiving annual payments of $4,000 as part of an agreement to build a casino on tribal land. Before the payments began, the average income of the eligible families was $22,145. To isolate the effect of this unearned income on adolescent development, the researchers divided the reservation's children into two groups — those who were younger than 16 when their families began receiving payments, and those who were that age or older — and then tracked their emotional and behavioral health over time through a variety of measures. (The researchers also included control groups of non–Native American families to make sure there weren't broader trends in the area that could account for any changes they observed.)
The resultant number-crunching was a bit complicated, but the key takeaway, as the researchers put it, is that “[t]he overall effect of an increase in unearned household income is an improvement in child personality traits by age 16. The results also indicate that there is a reduction in behavioral and emotional disorders.” Specifically, kids whose parents received the casino payments from the start of adolescence made far greater gains in the personality traits of “agreeableness” and “conscientiousness” than those who did not. What's more, the positive effects were most pronounced in children who had lagged behind their peers before the casino was built. And these benefits appear to have improved the children's later-life outcomes: When researchers reconnected with the subjects at age 25, those who benefited from the “gambling handouts” early in adolescence had, in the aggregate, attained a higher level of education and were more likely to hold a full-time job as compared to those whose families' benefits kicked in after age 16.
The durability of these effects is important when thinking about cash transfers to the poor as a form of government investment. If providing a low-income family with a small income subsidy improves their children's prospects for employment and emotional health later in life, then doing so may actually prove a cost-saving measure in the long term. This is especially plausible when one considers that adolescent emotional disorders not only correlate with later-life unemployment, but also criminality. The families in the study received a mere $4,000 a year. The annual cost of jailing a single prisoner in the U.S. can run as high as $40,000.
Ironically, this study suggests that “free stuff” produces improved outcomes by fostering the very “family values” that Republicans like Bush often champion as poverty's panacea. The authors note that greater family income has been shown to correlate with decreased marital stress and increased parental involvement and supervision. Families that received casino payments reported significantly better parent-child relationships than those who did not. Give a man some unearned income, in other words, and he'll have time to teach his son to fish.

WASHINGTON — The Senate on Wednesday started debating its first comprehensive energy legislation since the George W. Bush administration, a bipartisan measure meant to update the nation's power grid and oil and gas transportation systems to address major changes in the ways that power is now produced in the United States.
Since passage of the last major energy law, in 2007, the United States has gone from fears of oil and gas shortages to becoming the world's leading producer of both fuels. The use of wind and solar power is rapidly accelerating as those sources become cheaper than fossil fuels in some parts of the country. And President Obama's clean air regulations are reshaping the nation's power systems, as electric utilities shutter coal-fired power plants and replace them with alternative sources.
But the nation's energy infrastructure has not kept pace with those changes.
Throughout the Obama administration, partisan differences over energy policy and climate change meant that meaningful energy legislation had essentially no chance of passage. When bills were offered, they were partisan measures meant to score political points rather than to enact substantive policy.
People tracking the process on both sides of the political divide express some optimism that this time may be different and that the new legislation could make it to the president's desk. That will depend on whether debate over the bill spills into the presidential campaign, where it could be used as a proxy for issues like climate change, oil and gas drilling and Mr. Obama's regulatory agenda.
Goran Dragic's days in Phoenix appear to be numbered. The Suns point guard has informed management that he "has no plans to re-sign in Phoenix this summer," according to Sam Amick of USA Today. This is the case even if Phoenix moves fellow point guard Isaiah Thomas, according to Amick.
Dragic has a $7.5 million player option for next season, but it was always assumed that he would choose to become an unrestricted free agent instead. With Thursday's trade deadline looming, the Suns must now decide whether to trade Dragic or risk losing him in the offseason for nothing. They've informed Dragic's representatives that they plan on pursuing the former option and will try to trade him, according to Real GM's Shams Charania. ESPN's Marc Stein is also reporting that Dragic getting traded before Thursday's deadline is now "regarded as the likely scenario."
Agent Bill Duffy has provided the Suns a list of teams that Dragic would like to be traded to, which includes the Los Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat and New York Knicks, according to Yahoo! Sports' Adrian Wojnarowski.
The Houston Rockets -- Dragic's former team and one many thought would pursue him if he were to become available -- are not likely to be a possible desitnation, according to Stein.
SB Nation presents: Awesome NBA trades that SHOULD happen, but never will.
Phoenix is currently 29-25 and in possession of the Western Conference's final playoff spot. The 28-year-old Dragic is averaging 16.2 points, 4.1 assists and 3.6 rebounds per game this season while shooting 50 percent from the field. But he has not played as well as last season, when the Suns won 48 games. The addition of Thomas and the continued rise of Eric Bledsoe has forced Dragic to accept a secondary role, which he has not enjoyed. Per Amick:
The main issue, according to one of the people, is that Dragic wants to run his own team with the kind of freedom and support given to someone like Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors. The decrease in production this season, as he sees it, is directly tied to the decrease in time spent as the lead-guard with the host of ballhandlers that surround him. Dragic is averaging 16.2 points, 3.6 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 33.4 minutes per game this season.
There might be some teams around the league interested in handing Dragic the role he wants. But given his contract status, trading for Dragic before the deadline would be a risk, though any team that does acquire him would also get his Bird rights, meaning it could offer him a five-year deal in July.
If no team deals for him Dragic will look to sign a four-year max contract with either the Lakers or Knicks in the offseason, according to Stein.
Image caption Last year, the Peter 1 yacht sailed around the Arctic using both passages
Two major Arctic shipping routes have opened as summer sea ice melts, European satellites have found.
Data recorded by the European Space Agency's (Esa) Envisat shows both Canada's Northwest Passage and Russia's Northern Sea Route open simultaneously.
This summer's melt could break the 2007 record for the smallest area of sea ice since the satellite era began in 1979.
Shipping companies are already eyeing the benefits these routes may bring if they remain open regularly.
The two lanes have been used by a number of small craft several times in recent years.
But the Northern Sea Route has been free enough of ice this month for a succession of tankers carrying natural gas condensate from the northern port of Murmansk to sail along the Siberian coast en route for Thailand.
"They're often open at the same time in the sense that with some ingenuity you can get through them," observed Peter Wadhams, an Arctic ice expert from the University of Cambridge.
This year again confirms that we are in a new regime with substantially less summer ice Leif Toudal Pedersen, Danish Meteorological Institute
"But this time they've really been open, with a proper Suez-size tanker going through the Northern Sea Route with a full cargo - that's a real step forward," he told BBC News.
A number of major shipping companies are looking to the opening of these routes to shorten journey times and make their businesses more efficient.
But environmental groups are concerned that the progressive ice loss will lead to increased exploration for oil and gas.
This, they argue, presents major safety hazards in the often inclement Arctic, as well as strengthening the world's reliance on fossil fuels and so ensuring the progression of man-made global warming - and the disintegration of summer sea ice cover.
Model figure
The Arctic sea ice has been melting fast this year, and for a while it appeared set to break the 2007 record for the smallest minimum area in the satellite record.
Image caption The two Arctic passages combine to form a route right around the region
However, in recent weeks it has been running a narrow second to 2007.
"The minimum ice extent is still three to four weeks away, and a lot depends on the weather conditions over the Arctic during those weeks," said Leif Toudal Pedersen, senior scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute.
"Whether we reach an absolute minimum or not, this year again confirms that we are in a new regime with substantially less summer ice than before.
"The last five summers are the five minimum ice extent summers on record."
The volume of sea ice continues to decline annually.
Professor Wadhams believes the advent of summers where the two sea routes are routinely open is not far away.
"The Northwest Passage is probably the less reliable because you've got so many small passages in it where chance variations in wind will pile ice up and block it," he said.
"But so long as the ice retreats from the coast of Siberia, you'll have a route there."
Some computer models forecast that the Arctic could be completely clear of summer sea ice within a decade, though others recently published say there may be high years and low years en route to the final disappearance.
Canada and Russia are among the governments jockeying for position as new areas of the seabed open up for exploitation.

How they got here
The Anaheim Ducks, who won the Pacific Division with a record of 46-23-13 (105 points), face the resurgent Calgary Flames, who clinched the first wild card into the Stanley Cup Playoffs from the Western Conference with a record of 45-33-4 (94 points).
The best-of-7 Western Conference First Round series begins at Honda Center on Thursday (10:30 p.m. ET; NBCSN, CBC, TVA Sports).
Calgary is in the postseason for the second time in three seasons, first under coach Glen Gulutzan, who previously was coach of the Dallas Stars (2011-13) and an assistant in Vancouver (2013-16). The Flames face a Ducks team that has won the division five consecutive seasons but has not advanced past the conference final since winning the Stanley Cup in 2007.

5 storylines
Impact of April 4: Will there be any repercussions from the final regular-season game between the Ducks and Flames? Emotions erupted after Flames defenseman Mark Giordano's knee-on-knee hit knocked Ducks defenseman Cam Fowler out of the game in Anaheim. Fowler sprained his right knee and will be out for 2-6 weeks.
Epic home streak: Almost lost in the controversy of the April 4 game between the Ducks and Flames was that the Anaheim's regular-season winning streak against Calgary at Honda Center was extended to 25 games. The Flames (0-20-5) haven't won in the regular season in Anaheim since Jan. 19, 2004. Calgary is going to have to find a way to break the curse. The Flames dropped all three games in Anaheim against the Ducks in the playoffs two years ago in the second round. In 2006, the Flames defeated the Ducks 5-2 in Game 3, at Anaheim on April 25 in the first round.
Depth perception: The Ducks hold the edge in terms of scoring at the top end. Four players scored more than 20 goals this season: Rickard Rakell (33), Patrick Eaves (32; 11 with Ducks, 21 with Stars), Jakob Silfverberg (23) and Ryan Kesler (22). Sean Monahan (27) and Mikael Backlund (22) were the only Flames with more than 20 goals. However, 12 Flames scored 10 or more goals compared to nine for the Ducks.
Matthew Tkachuk ready for prime time: The son of former NHL player Keith Tkachuk doesn't act like a rookie or play like one. After sparking London of the Ontario Hockey League to the 2016 Memorial Cup, the 19-year-old never looked out of place at the NHL level and never hit the rookie wall. Tkachuk's 48 points (13 goals, 35 assists) were fifth on the Flames.

"This is going to be a new experience for him," Calgary general manager Brad Treliving said on "Hockey Night in Canada" on Saturday. "The one thing we know is the lights won't be too bright for him. This is a guy who rises in big game and big moments. He's not shy to be on the big stage."
Coaching contrast: One of the advantages held by the Ducks is in playoff coaching experience. It's vast. Gulutzan will be coaching in his first NHL playoff game -- the Stars did not qualify for the postseason in his two seasons in Dallas. For the Ducks, Randy Carlyle has coached in 69 NHL playoff games -- 62 with the Ducks and seven with the Toronto Maple Leafs -- and won the Stanley Cup with Anaheim in 2007. Few coaches are better at the matchup game than Carlyle.
By the numbers
10: The number of game-winning goals by Rakell, who led the League despite missing the first 11 games of the season after an apendectomy. Jeff Carter of the Los Angeles Kings, Filip Forsberg of the Nashville Predators and Cam Atkinson of the Columbus Blue Jackets were tied for second with nine each.
5: Number of 50-point scorers on the Ducks: Getzlaf (73), Kesler (58), Corey Perry (53), Patrick Eaves (51; 14 with the Ducks, 37 with the Stars) and Rakell (51). Eaves spent most of the season with the Stars before he was traded to the Ducks on Feb. 24.
11: The number of goals allowed by goaltender Brian Elliott, then of the St. Louis Blues, in the conference final against the San Jose Sharks last season. Elliott started the first three games of that series but did not play again until Game 6 after being replaced by Jake Allen in Game 3.
In the spotlight
Ducks: Ryan Getzlaf, center -- There is a delightfully quirky aspect to Ducks-Flames games at Scotiabank Saddledome. A banner of Getzlaf, from his days with the Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League, hangs from the rafters. With the division on the line Sunday, Getzlaf had three assists in a 4-3 overtime victory against the Los Angeles Kings. Getzlaf had 11 points (one goal, 10 assists) in the final seven games of the season, and his 58 assists were third in the League.
Video: ANA@CGY: Holzer buries Getzlaf's sweet cross-ice pass
Flames: Brian Elliott, goalie -- The Flames have come a long way from two years ago when they opened the second round against the Ducks with goaltender Jonas Hiller, who quickly gave way to Karri Ramo. Elliott, who was acquired from the Blues at the 2016 NHL Draft on June 24 for two draft picks, is a big upgrade. And when Elliott got off to a slow start this season, backup Chad Johnson kept the Flames afloat until Elliott got comfortable. Elliott finished with 26 wins.

Keys to victory
Ducks: Anaheim, which finished the season with a 14-game point streak (11-0-3), needs prompt success. A long, tough series works against the Ducks, who have been eliminated from the postseason each of the past four seasons at home in Game 7. The Ducks have been able to retool their roster in a subtle manner, but their defense will be tested with the absence of Fowler.
Flames: Calgary is back in the playoffs for the first time since 2015, but its stay will be short-lived if it can't get past the demons of Honda Center. With the Ducks holding home-ice advantage, the questions about the Flames' inability to win in Anaheim will begin immediately. Calgary will need to win at least one game on the road in order to advance.
Coming from an IGN interview with Tequila Works...
The Nintendo Switch version is being developed by Tantalus, the studio behind the HD version of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. We worked side by side with them to ensure the Nintendo Switch version is absolutely true to the original vision we have for RiME, and they are doing a terrific work indeed! We are really enthusiastic about Nintendo Switch and we are immensely happy about releasing RiME on that console, but it's too early to discuss future developments. Let's finish RiME first! :)
There is still a lot of development to take into consideration, but we're working hard to get the Nintendo Switch version ready for release at the same time as the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Windows PC versions in May. We'll have more info to share in the months to come.
Even more exciting, the possibility of a physical release is currently being explored. No official word yet, but keep your fingers crossed.
A teacher in Scottsdale has been charged for allegedly trying to pay for sex with an underage girl.
Court records show the teacher has been with BASIS Scottsdale for a year. He reportedly set up a profile page on a social media application and used it to set up a pay for sex meeting with a girl he believed to be 15 years old.
Police report Connor Ray Cleland portrayed himself as a 16-year-old on an undercover social media application. In reality, he's a 24-year-old teacher.
The on-line conversations lasted about two weeks. On May 26, they set up a meeting where Cleland would pay the '15-year-old' $40 for oral sex.
That afternoon, Cleland, a Scottsdale resident, went to a home in Chandler, near Arizona Avenue and Queen Creek Road to meet the girl. Police were waiting for him and reportedly found $40 in cash in his pocket when he was arrested.
Cleland has been charged with prostitution with a minor, age misrepresentation and luring a minor for sexual exploitation.
According to Basis Schools, "The faculty member has been terminated and BASIS Scottsdale will cooperate fully in the police investigation."
As a developer you should benefit from all the tools and utilities available to you, whether they're within your IDE or right in your terminal, you should use or better yet abuse them to the maximum. It's very simple to overlook the benefits if you do not consider the impact of clean, well written and maintainable code.
The Zen
This poses a big problem in the python world too, especially since we as a, dare I say CULT, tend to be very strict about the code we write. How many languages do you know that actually has its ideology available as part of the system itself?
% python -m this The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. ...
You'll frequently find authors or speakers quoting lines off the above and while they can be misconstrued as a law, they really tends to be more of guidelines to how you should be writing your code.
The PEP8
Coincidentally there also exists another set of guidelines pertaining to the style you should be writing your python code in. It comes in its own Python Enhancement Proposal (or just PEP) called PEP8.
Now while PEP8 is a GUIDE, following it to the letter makes the majority of the code you or your peer write, quite readable to both. Always remember that code is more read than written, so you should always take that extra step into ensuring your code is very, very, readable.
I'd assume at first glance over PEP8, one can be overwhelmed with its content but I assure you that you wouldn't need to read that page more than once for the most part (unless you're a freak like me that constantly links to segments of PEP8 :-)). Fear not, there are several tools at your disposal that should assist you with your PEP8 needs. The first notable one being pep8 , a python package that you can install (if not already installed) using:
% pip install pep8
Sample usage:
% pep8 code.py code.py:4:14: E231 missing whitespace after ',' code.py:6:18: E231 missing whitespace after ',' code.py:7:80: E501 line too long (81 > 79 characters)
pep8 is able to report most PEP8 violations which you can solve manually.
You can find the official package here.
The Pyflakes
Now that we have the style guidelines out of the way, now we need to detect as many errors statically as we possibly can. The more errors you can catch before the code runs, the less headache you get when it does run. A neat tool that allows us to catch errors in python source files is Pyflakes which you can install using:
% pip install pyflakes
Sample usage:
% pyflakes code.py code.py:14: undefined name 'operate'
Pyflakes can detect several issues like shadowing variables in loops, undefined names, duplicate arguments and more.
You can find the official package here
The Flake8
Flake8 wraps both tools mentioned earlier and a third and provides you with a uniform way of checking your source code for issues before running the code. You can install this package using:
% pip install flake8
Sample usage:
% flake8 code.py code.py:4:14: E231 missing whitespace after ',' code.py:4:14: undefined name 'operate' code.py:6:18: E231 missing whitespace after ',' code.py:7:80: E501 line too long (81 > 79 characters)
Flake8 should be the primary check you make as soon as you write python code. It doesn't matter if you do it manually from the command line, or configure your text editor or IDE to do it for you, just make sure it does run!
You can find the official package here
The Hacking
hacking improves upon Flake8 by providing plug-ins that check against the OpenStack Style Guidelines. Given OpenStack's primary language is Python and contains over a million lines of code, the need for an extensive guideline is a must. You can install this package using:
% pip install hacking
You can find the official package here
The Pylint
Pylint is your personal code quality dictating machine! it checks against a huge list of violations and provides you with a summary all the while keeping track of your sequence runs, showing you if the code improved and by what factor. Obviously each violation has a different weight and if (and most probably will) you wish to suppress a specific warning or error code, you can configure Pylint to do so. You can install Pylint using:
% pip install pylint
Sample usage:
% pylint code.py ************* Module code C: 4, 0: Exactly one space required after comma for j,row in enumerate(array): ^ (bad-whitespace) C: 6, 0: Exactly one space required after comma for i,column in enumerate(row): ^ (bad-whitespace) C: 19, 0: No space allowed before bracket sum(array[lmi(j-1) ][lmi(i-1):lma(i+2, w)]), ^ (bad-whitespace) C: 20, 0: No space allowed before bracket sum(array[j ][lmi(i-1):lma(i+2, w)]), ^ (bad-whitespace) C: 23, 0: Exactly one space required after comma return 1 if (alive and living_cells in (2,3)) or \ ^ (bad-whitespace) C: 27, 0: Trailing whitespace (trailing-whitespace) C: 1, 0: Missing module docstring (missing-docstring) C: 1, 0: Missing class docstring (missing-docstring) C: 2, 4: Missing method docstring (missing-docstring) W: 6,18: Unused variable 'column' (unused-variable) C: 13, 4: Invalid argument name "h" (invalid-name) C: 13, 4: Invalid argument name "w" (invalid-name) C: 13, 4: Missing method docstring (missing-docstring) R: 13, 4: Too many arguments (6/5) (too-many-arguments) W: 14, 8: Statement seems to have no effect (pointless-statement) E: 14, 8: Undefined variable 'a' (undefined-variable) R: 13, 4: Method could be a function (no-self-use)
You can find the official package here
The Radon
Radon is a tool that measures various metrics by inspecting your source code. It's capable of providing raw metrics, maintainability metrics, cyclomatic complexity and more. You can review the details of these measurements on radon's official documentation site. You can install this tool using:
% pip install radon
Sample usage:
% radon cc code.py code.py M 13:4 Operation.get_successor - B C 1:0 Operation - A M 2:4 Operation.next_gen - A M 8:10 Process.next - C C 20:0 Process- C
I prefer maintaining a grade of B+ for the majority of the code I write though to be fair, if you're already abusing the tools mentioned previously, you're well on your way in achieving A grade code.
You can find the official package here
The Mastool
This would be a personal plug. Mastool is a static analysis checker that I've written after witnessing a bundle of easily avoidable practices in python. It's still in its early stage of development, but it's capable of reporting a decent amount of violations (albeit in some context these violations can be permitted). The tool can check against built-in assignments, silent generic exceptions and other. You can install this tool using:
% pip install mastool
Sample usage:
% mastool code.py code.py:14: AssignToBuiltin code.py:30: SilentGenericException
You can find the official package here
-
While some of the tools mentioned above may overlap in some violation reporting, you really need to make sure that you use these tools constantly. Get in the habit of running them as part of your development work flow and you will soon reap the benefits when others applaud you for writing stable, clean, readable and most importantly maintainable code.
Always keep in mind that while these tools will not magically make you a better programmer, they will simply ensure that your code is consistent with others and while a team of developers can decide on their own guidelines, it would be far more fitting to ensure that the guidelines can carry over from a team to the next.
Finally, I leave you all with a talk by Raymond Hettinger titled Beyond PEP 8 -- Best practices for beautiful intelligible code

Chantell and Michael Sackett's case against the Environmental Protection Agency before the Supreme Court on Monday might appear to be David versus Goliath. But those supporting the Sacketts with friend-of-the-court briefs are corporate Goliaths like General Electric and real estate developers eager to weaken the E.P.A.'s ability to protect wetlands and waterways under the federal Clean Water Act.
The Sacketts owned a small lot about 500 feet from Idaho's pristine Priest Lake. They filled part of it with dirt and rock in preparing to build a house. The E.P.A. determined that the lot is federally protected wetland so the Sacketts needed a permit to do the work, which they did not seek. The agency ordered the couple to remove the fill because pollutants were being discharged.
The E.P.A. can issue compliance orders directing violators to get a permit and remedy any damage they caused. But to enforce an order, the agency has to sue in federal court; it does not have power to take action against a violator on its own. The Sacketts in their brief say they had no reason to believe their lot was covered by the Clean Water Act, though there is evidence to the contrary. They argue that lack of judicial review of the compliance order violated their due process rights, though they could have challenged the order through the agency's administrative process — and could have gotten a permit after the E.P.A. told them they needed one.
Almost every federal court that has considered the issue found that the law does not allow “judicial review of compliance orders until the E.P.A. brings an enforcement action,” as the Ninth Circuit appeals court said in ruling against the Sacketts. The court explained that this process allows the agency “to act to address environmental problems quickly and without becoming immediately entangled in litigation.” Allowing challenges to E.P.A. orders before they are enforced would give landowners the ability to delay in correcting the harm they caused. Compliance orders are useful because they allow the agency to press landowners to negotiate about mitigating harms.
This case goes far beyond the Sacketts' right to fill in their lot without a permit. If the Supreme Court allows them to seek pre-enforcement review, it will be handing a big victory to corporations and developers who want to evade the requirements of the Clean Water Act.
Medical marijuana company Aurora Cannabis held an official groundbreaking Friday for its massive production facility near the Edmonton airport to mark the facility's — and the company's — progress.
Work on the 75,000-square-metre facility, dubbed Aurora Sky, began last fall. The skeleton of about one quarter of the facility is already up.
“It's astonishing. We're building the country's largest cannabis facility on 30 acres of federal land,” said Cam Battley, executive vice-president of Aurora Cannabis.
Construction of the facility, located next to the Edmonton International Airport, is expected to be complete before the legalization of recreational marijuana in July 2018. However, the company hopes to start production before the end of 2017 to meet growing demand for medical marijuana.
Once marijuana is legalized and the facility is running at full capacity, the company expects to produce more than 100,000 kg of marijuana per year.
While construction is happening quickly — the facility uses pre-engineered modules shipped from the Netherlands — Battley said creating a recreational marijuana production business will take time.
“We're not fooling ourselves. The legalization of marijuana needs to be done responsibly. We're working with partners in government to do it right,” said Battley.
“We have the experience to work within a rules-based system under government regulations.”
Aurora Cannabis already runs a 5,000-square-metre medical marijuana facility in Cremona, north of Calgary, which Battley said “is already tapped.”
The new facility is expected to create 200 to 300 jobs, from highly skilled technicians to security guards. The company hopes the facility will make Edmonton a centre for the lucrative cannabis industry, which Battley said could become as large as the distilling and brewing industries.
“We're inventing a new industry in real time,” said Battley.
Here's a look at the facility construction so far. This is about 1/4 of the final size #aurorasky pic.twitter.com/0YOtpRTzdf — Michelle LePage (@MichelleAbroad) June 16, 2017
The company is investing more than $100 million in the new facility, and is also investing in other cannabis-related companies in the Edmonton region. Its e-commerce business model and proximity to the airport are also expected to bring more economic activity to the region.
“This is an anchor,” said Municipal Affairs Minister Shaye Anderson. “Other businesses and industries will see this as a great place to invest.
“I've seen it coming for awhile,” he added. “I'm surprised it's taken this long.”

What started out as a worldwide service campaign for the water-cooled BMW R1200GS models is turning into a massive global recall for the German motorcycle manufacturer, as now the United States has joined the United Kingdom in issuing a recall on the popular ADV machine.
Accordingly, BMW Motorrad USA has issued a “stop sale” to BMW dealers, as documents for a recall with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are being readied for release.
The recall sees BMW Motorrad dealers inspecting the fixed fork tube on R1200GS models produced between November 2013 and June 2017. If the inspected motorcycle has an excessively large gap between the fork pipe and the seal plug, then the fork cannot be repaired by the dealer, and must be replaced.
If no gap is present (or if the gap is of an acceptable distance), BMW dealers must still press in a sleeve on the fork, before returning the bike back to the owner. With over 150,000 motorcycles potentially affected worldwide, this recall will be a massive undertaking for BMW Motorrad.
As of right now, BMW Motorrad USA is telling American dealers that they can order only 10 bushings per week. So by our math, that means this recall could take up to 20 weeks to complete (assuming two bushings per bike, and every machine is affected), as BMW Motorrad has roughly 1,500 dealers worldwide.
Of course, BMW Motorrad will likely be able to ramp up its recall efforts as time goes on, and not all models produced will have an excessive fork gap.
These facts will hopefully shorten the amount of time it will take for its dealer network to inspect and repair all the water-cooled BMW R1200GS and R1200GS Adventure models on the road. Still, this news means that BMW is looking again at a major recall for one of its most popular machines.
Next, we expect to see an official announcement from NHTSA about this recall, but affected BMW owners should already be in touch with their local BMW Motorrad USA dealership.

Everyone's been making fun of the Surface Pro for being so stingy on hard drive space. The 128GB version of the Surface Pro only has 90GB of free space (originally reported to be 83GB but since boosted). Where the hell did the other 38 gigs go? Well, you could ask the same question to the 128GB version of the MacBook Air. The MBA only has 92GB of free space. What!

And get this. With a few tweaks (namely removing the recovery image), the Surface Pro 128GB actually has more usable space than the equivalent 128GB MacBook Air. Why's everyone making fun of Microsoft for hijacking space? HMM?
Ed Bott of ZDNet, and unapologetic Microsoft man, dug deep to determine the true difference in space between the Surface Pro and the MacBook Air. It's worth a read if you're into splitting bits from bytes and breaking down binary and base-10. Basically, Apple and Windows report disk size differently leading Microsoft too look worse than it actually is. [ZDNet]
I strapped on a pair of virtual reality (VR) goggles and looked around the room. There were three PageWide printers sitting off in the corner, so I reached out and pressed a lever to open the paper tray. A voice off in the distance, like a ghost in the fog, told me to try lifting the copier lid as well.
I was at HP in Palo Alto, California, and the demo was meant to show me how their multi-function printers work. Interestingly, VR and augmented reality (AR) today do not take advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) as much as you might think. I wasn't able to ask a question and have a bot respond. The VR looked ultra-realistic, but it was all self-contained within a structured environment. The demo was more like a 3D-rendered slideshow with some interactions. But in the future, AI will play a much bigger role.
Microsoft knows this, and that's why a recent announcement about adding an AI co-processor to the HoloLens 2 caught my eye. The chip will help with tagging data in the real world, which sounds just as complex and compute intensive as you can imagine. Also, this processing will work much faster when the chip runs locally instead of in the cloud.
[ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ]
You can picture how this might work in a printer demo. The HoloLens is not VR; it uses AR instead. In a real office, the kit might show 3D-rendered printers and you might still reach out and interact with them. With more processing power for AI, the HoloLens 2 might show you stats such as how many sheets you can print in a minute. It might be able to take data from the office floor plan and calculate whether the printer will fit on a desk. You could see how much power the printer would use over a week, a month or a year. You could see other animations that show the network infrastructure and the actual wiring installed. And you could correlate all of this data and see how it all could work in your office, in real time.
This real-time processing could create a whole new paradigm of interaction. AI could calculate a lot more than printer output times. With a fast co-processor, I might be able to see how much the printer will cost in consumables and printing for the actual output from the office based on network usage. I might be able to quickly visualize who will print the most in an office—say, marketing will use the printer much more often than accounting. I could see how the printer fits into a budget for all of the devices in a room, including laptops and phones.
Overall, the AI could power a new set of overlays on the real world that are incredibly useful. Using the technology in your car as a HUD in the dashboard instead of as a head-mounted device, you could see traffic estimates based on a sensor network and your autonomous car could analyze thousands of inputs to calculate the safest route through some thorny traffic. During a Skype call in a virtual room, you could ask a bot for information about those in attendance and see a summary for each person in real time. In a manufacturing demo, you could look at parts of a new product and see their associated costs, how long each one would take to produce in the overall manufacturing process, and who could supply the part.
Of course, we know this is coming soon because there are already glimmers of how this will work. Yelp used AR in their app a few years ago. What's different is that the chip could process the data much faster and locally, helping us interpret the world and react by making smarter business decisions. It could be the difference between a VR demo that shows how a printer works to an AR demo that helps us make a better decision. That's the ultimate win in the enterprise.
A study published in the April 12 issue of Neuron has found that a newly-developed compound can reverse many of the symptoms associated with Fragile X syndrome (FXS). The paper reports that FXS correction can occur in adult mice with established symptoms. FXS is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and a leading cause of autism. Using an mGlu5 inhibitor called CTEP on a mouse model of FXS, the researchers set out to examine whether pharmacologic inhibition of mGlu5 could reverse FXS symptoms in mature mice. "We found that even when treatment with CTEP was started in adult mice, it reduced a wide range of FXS symptoms, including learning and memory deficits and auditory hypersensitivity, as well as morphological changes and signaling abnormalities characteristic of the disease," Lothar Lindemann, who led the study, said in a press release.
When EW visited the Brooklyn set of Marvel's Jessica Jones, star Krysten Ritter was just a few days away from wrapping on the 13-episode season — now available to stream on Netflix — and she was admittedly tired. The job had lasted eight months, longer than any the actress has ever tackled, but the long hours hadn't dampened Ritter's spirits. She took the exhaustion all in stride, preferring to look at it as research.
You can read our entire conversation with Ritter from the set of Jessica Jones below.
ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Was wanting to play this part a no-brainer?
KRYSTEN RITTER: Marvel is obviously a giant, global super-brand, so being a part of that is exciting because of the huge built-in audience and the appetite for it. I feel like I'm probably the coolest one because it's such a character piece. This is actor candy. This isn't like all of the other Marvel superhero properties or movies you've seen. This is a very well-crafted, developed, psychological thriller.
How does it compare to the comics?
I think she is as developed in the show as she is in the comics. When I got the gig, I read all of the comics and called Jeph Loeb asking, “What's next? What's after Alias?” It's so good. I was so excited. He said, “While I appreciate your appetite for all things Jessica Jones, she will be just as developed for television.” She is a former superhero with a really, really dark, twisted past, and that comes back to haunt her from the beginning. That's the journey that we go on with her. She's a very reluctant superhero.
When we meet her, is she taking on cases as a detective?
Just to make a buck, honestly. She's not trying to save the city or really do anything. She's making money to buy whiskey. She's a P.I. because it's a great opportunity for her to use her unorthodox skills and not work with people and work at night. She doesn't have to exist and socialize.
How do her powers manifest?
She represses a lot of her abilities. She kind of wants nothing to do with it, but when she has to, she will rise to the occasion. She's super strong. She's a bit of a brawler. She can fly, but not well … at all. So she doesn't do that often, because she's so bad at it. She's just not a very good superhero. She's a real misfit. She's a real f—ing misfit.
That's got to be fun for you.
It's so much fun. It's a great part. She's so cool and so strong. She's got all of this power. I mean, it's one of the most exciting roles I've ever seen, man or woman.
Were you fight-training?
As soon as I got the part, I was fight-training and boxing. I can throw a punch now. At the beginning, I had no idea what I was doing. I was always like, “What do I do with my thumbs?” I enjoy the stunt portion of the show. I had no idea I would, from the first episode. I was like, “Oh my God. This is so thrilling.” I think we were doing a night shoot. Usually around two or three in the morning, you start to go down. I was just like, “Who, who else can I–” … I've accidentally hit people because I've gotten kind of into it.
What's the feeling been like on set?
This has been such an epic and thrilling experience and nothing like I've ever imagined because it's been so full-on. I've been working harder than I've ever dreamed I'd have to and learning a lot. I don't know how I'll adjust right away, back to normal life. I'm going to probably sleep for a week. I'm very tired. It's been so thrilling. Every day, it's been, “Is this really happening? Yep, it's really happening.”

How long have you been shooting?
I've been here for eight months.
That's a long time!
Yeah, I've never done anything that long. The last show I did was a half-hour, so it was less time. This is a big show, so it takes longer to shoot an episode.
What's it been like working with David Tennant?
David is heaven, and he's such a wonderful actor. This whole cast and the show is really on another level. Everyone is so uniquely special and right for their parts. For me, I'm here every day, and then someone else will come in. I'll get a lot of one-on-one time with David Tennant. Then I get a lot of one-on-one time with Rachael Taylor. For me, it's been f—ing great to really spend time with all of these people on camera and off. David is constantly impressing me. His acting is like jazz. He's doing one thing, and then he's doing something else. He can do a five-page scene like it's nothing. I'm just continually impressed by him and his work ethic. He's so positive. He's just a great guy.
It sounds like it will be dark. Where does this fall compared to Jane choking on her vomit on Breaking Bad?
It's darker. This is unlike anything Marvel has done before. People are going to be surprised by that. I think your mind goes to a certain place when you think of Marvel. I think the most exciting thing about them is their ability to execute things really well. This is them doing something completely different. This is all really right for that book and where Jessica started. The tone is pretty spot-on.
That sounds right with Daredevil.
It's not violent. I think it's proportional for what that is. This is equally standing on its own. It's like, “Whoa, what the f— is this?” Marvel has like 9,000 characters. They could do a horror movie tomorrow and call it Marvel. They can do anything. It's really exciting for me to be a part of them doing something so different.
Is this a binger?
I think so because it's serialized. It feels like a 13-hour movie. I haven't seen the show, so who knows? You might need a breather. This show feels more like a movie than any serialized show I can think of.
What are the hard days on set for you?
We have pretty long hours. It's pretty hardcore. The hardest part is starting early mornings on Monday and then by Wednesday working overnight, so I feel like I'm flying to Asia every week, getting off the plane and coming right back to work.
Did you get hurt at all?
I got a little bit of whiplash. It was fine.
It sounds like your lack of sleep might help the character.
That's part of it. Jessica Jones doesn't sleep much either. All of it really feeds the character. She doesn't sleep. She's got odd hours. It works for the role.
Wiki Wormhole We explore some of Wikipedia's oddities in our 5,664,405-week series, Wiki Wormhole.
This week's entry: Toilet-related injuries and deaths (Warning: the link contains one major Game Of Thrones spoiler for events that will almost certainly be covered in an upcoming episode.)
What it's about: The arrival of springtime is celebrated in cultures across the world, as Christian Easter, Hindu Janmashtami, Buddhist Theravada, Sikh Vaisakhi are each built around themes of new beginnings and rebirth. All of them draw on the most ancient and sacred tradition of all—a reverence of the very cycles of life and death that are at the heart of all existence. So, as spring dawns and nature again renews itself, we decided to ignore all that stuff and talk about people who died on the can.
Strangest fact: Toilets have sunk more ships than torpedoes. On most ships, the head connects to an opening below the water line, where waste is expelled, and flush water is taken in. If that connection leaks, or water flows the wrong way, the ship can take on water, and in some cases sink. There isn't any hard data on how many ships are resting in Davy Jones' Locker because of a leaky toilet, but Wikipedia estimates tens of thousands “of all types and sizes.”
Biggest controversy: As is often the case with Wikipedia, the scope of the article is a point of contention, with a discussion on the talk page that devolves into some name-calling, on whether someone who died while sitting on the toilet can be considered a “toilet-related death” if the toilet itself didn't cause the injury. There's also a heated discussion on whether Elvis Presley did in fact die on the toilet, as frequently reported, or elsewhere in the bathroom.
Thing we were happiest to learn: There's no shortage of fictional toilet-related injuries and deaths. From Doc Brown inventing the flux capacitor after hitting his head on a toilet, to the mayhem that unfolds every time Vincent Vega takes a bathroom break, to Rorschach killing rioting jailbirds with electrified toilet water. And, of course, the aforementioned Game Of Thrones spoiler, in which all of the major characters are killed during a bathroom break at Daenerys and Jon Snow's wedding reception.
Thing we were unhappiest to learn: Sometimes you can't escape fate. Convicted murderer Michael Anderson Godwin had been sentenced to die in the electric chair, but had his sentence commuted. While serving out that lesser sentence, he sat on the metal toilet while trying to repair a TV. He bit down on one of the wires, and the resulting current flowed through the toilet, electrocuting him. Thing we were second-unhappiest to learn? Black widow spiders have been known to spin a web under toilet seats (particularly in outhouses) and bite the toilet's unsuspecting users. Fortunately, despite the widow's reputation, their bites are rarely fatal.
Also noteworthy: Several historical figures have been murdered while sitting on the toilet, including (allegedly) Edmund II of England and Japanese warlord Uesugi Kenshin (also allegedly). The one royal we know was murdered while taking care of business was Wenceslaus III, of Bohemia, Hungary, and Poland. He was stabbed to death with a spear while using the garderobe—a medieval convenience in which a person's waste drained to the exterior of a castle, usually ending up in the moat. Wenceslaus III is not to be confused with his ancestor, Good King Wenceslaus I, of Christmas carol fame, who was also murdered, but not in the garderobe.
Best link to elsewhere on Wikipedia: The Ig Nobel Prize, an award handed out annually to especially pointless or trivial scientific achievements. In this instance, the prize was three physicians who wrote a report in 1993 on patients who had sustained injuries to the buttocks due to a collapsing toilet.
Marcel Antoine Wayne Reece[1] (born June 23, 1985) is an American football fullback who is currently a free agent. He was signed by the Miami Dolphins as an undrafted free agent in 2008. He played college football as a wide receiver at Washington. He has also been a member of the Oakland Raiders and Seattle Seahawks.
High school and college [ edit ]
Reece attended Hesperia High School in Hesperia, California, where he was a first-team All-league performer in football, basketball and track. In football, he earned All-league honors as a wide receiver. He continued his playing career at Chaffey College where he posted 25 receptions for 600 yards and 7 touchdowns. Reece decided to transfer to El Camino College the following year where he posted 47 catches for 1,286 yards and 13 touchdowns. This performance earned him a scholarship to the University of Washington. He broke out during his senior year and made 39 catches for 761 yards and 8 touchdowns. The most notable play of Reece's career came against the University of Arizona where he had a 98-yard reception for a touchdown, which is the longest play from scrimmage in UW history. He also became a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity.
In track & field, Reece competed as a sprinter while at Hesperia, earning All-league honors. He recorded a personal-best time of 49.8 seconds in the 400-meter dash as a senior.[2] In addition, he also recorded a 4.45-second 40-yard dash, bench-pressed 360 pounds and had a 34-inch vertical.

Despite posting a 4.4-second 40-yard dash, Reece was not drafted. He was noted as a "tweener" scouts did not know what position would fit Marcel in the NFL. He was noted as being too big to be a receiver and too small to be a tight end.
Miami Dolphins [ edit ]
He was signed by the Miami Dolphins as an undrafted free agent in 2008. That same year, he was later cut after not making the final squad.
Oakland Raiders [ edit ]
The Raiders picked him up and experimented with him in a variety of positions and in this process found that fullback fit him best. The position was a difficult transition for Reece at first but he embraced the challenge. Reece spent the entire 2008 season and the majority of the 2009 campaign on the Raiders' practice squad.
In the 2010 NFL season, he emerged as the starting fullback for the Oakland Raiders, hauling in 25 receptions for 333 yards and 3 touchdowns while rushing for 122 yards and one touchdown. He blocked for his teammate running back Darren McFadden, who rushed for 1,157 yards and 7 touchdowns.
In 2012, after a series of injuries to McFadden and back-up Mike Goodson, Marcel Reece was switched from fullback to running back. He rushed for a total of 271 yards and recorded 52 receptions for 496 yards and one touchdown.
In 2013, both McFadden and back-up Rashad Jennings were limited due to injures, allowing Reece to line up at running back. On December 27, 2013, he was the lone Raider selected for the 2013 Pro Bowl, his second Pro Bowl nomination.[3]
On December 23, 2014, Reece was selected once again to the Pro Bowl, marking his third straight Pro Bowl appearance at the fullback position.[4]
In 2015, after Derek Carr suffered an injury to his throwing hand, Matt McGloin stepped in at quarterback, finding Reece for two receiving touchdowns, in a season-opening loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. On December 22, 2015, he was selected to his fourth straight Pro Bowl.[5] On December 28, 2015, Reece was suspended for four games for violating league policy on performance-enhancing substances.[6]
Reece was released by the Raiders on September 26, 2016.[7]
Seattle Seahawks [ edit ]
On December 6, 2016, Reece was signed by the Seattle Seahawks.[8]
On July 28, 2017, Reece was re-signed by the Seahawks.[9] He was released on September 2, 2017.[10]

As we consider how to reach a lost generation of youth, it is important to examine our assumptions. The false assumption that often underlies this question is that systematic, age-segregated youth ministry, as defined in this book, is actually effective in reaching lost youth. People who maintain this assumption often believe that there are two ways to engage a lost generation: an effective way, through age-segregated youth ministry, and an ineffective way, through the obedience of individuals and the ministry of biblically ordered families and churches. This false assumption asserts that if the church gathers all the generations together, it is going to be ineffective in reaching the rising generation.
It is important to begin with biblical assumptions and practices. The primary principle we should embrace is that the best results in reaching youth will always come from obeying biblical commands and honoring explicitly biblical principles. If we are faithful to obey biblical commands in the church and the home, live out the great commission, and devote our life to that of “the watchman” (Ezek. 33:6-7), we will be living a lifestyle of biblical faithfulness that will be effective in reaching a lost generation. In this sense, faithfulness to God's Word is success. If we can agree on this principle, then we can take the next step of debating which methods are biblical and which ones are not.
Where Is This Lost Generation?
We must be careful to identify accurately where these lost youth are. This unevangelized generation can be found in two places: inside the church and outside the church.
We should not forget that many of today's lost generation are in families that are already in the church. They are lost in their sins and remain unconverted until God regenerates them and they repent and believe the gospel.
On the other hand, the lost youth outside the church may have no Christian parents. They may not have a father who is “bring[ing] them up in the training and admonition of the Lord” (Eph. 6:4), and they are not involved in any church. They are scattered in neighborhoods, apartment complexes, workplaces, coffee shops, and other places. Scripture shows us at least four major ways that a lost generation like this can be engaged.
First, we need to follow the ministry pattern of Christ and the apostles, which is the best pattern to follow for reaching any subgroup. The Lord Jesus ministered to people as they passed by. To reach the lost, we need to live like Christ did and take the opportunities that God gives us. We see the same pattern with the apostles. They ministered to the people on the streets, in the synagogues, and from house to house. Wherever they were, they did not shrink back from delivering the message of the gospel.
Second, we must be involved in fulfilling the Great Commission. This is the responsibility of every Christian. In Matthew 28:18-20, Jesus Christ charged believers to “make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” Believers are also commanded to preach the gospel to all men, both “in season and out of season” (2 Tim. 4:2). This personal ministry is critical for youth discipleship.
Third, fathers should take responsibility for the fatherless. God gave fathers the responsibility to care for the fatherless. We need more men like Job who took responsibility for a lost generation. The fatherless were in his house and at his table (Job 31:16-22). James says that this is “pure and undefiled religion” (Jas. 1:27). No new program needs to be created for the care of the fatherless. God has already told us how to reach them.
Fourth, we need to have biblically functioning households. Psalm 68:5-6 states that God is “a father to the fatherless, a defender of widows is God in His holy habitation. God sets the solitary in families.” Open homes are able to fulfill this divine purpose regarding a lost generation of fatherless children. When a home is used for hospitality, ministry opportunities to a lost generation are increased. God, who designed the resources of a household for ministry, has called His people to use those resources for His glory, not only for the saints, but also for a lost generation.
These means of reaching the lost are all a natural outworking of obedience, and they expose a lost generation to the love of Jesus. When we put children in a youth group, we give them a skewed vision of life. Scripture suggests that putting youth with youth multiplies foolishness among them. When we segregate youth from other ages, we are giving them peers, instead of placing them with the rest of Christ's body, which is what they need. Churches with biblically ordered meetings and relationships are far better at reaching a lost generation than an alternative that does not reflect the structure that God has ordained.
Can you imagine a more unstable subgroup in which to put youth than with a group of peers? In contrast, can you imagine a more stable or life-giving subgroup than a well-functioning church?
Think of the impact of a God-centered home in which a husband and wife are functioning biblically. The relationships there depict the gospel: husbands loving their wives as Christ loved the Church; wives submitting to their husbands as the church submits to Christ; and children, who have a genuine love for Christ, displaying honor and obedience to their parents. A God-centered home is a powerful force for evangelism.
God has delivered to us a pattern for reaching youth who have no parents. It is to preach the gospel to them when we go about the community, fold them into individual families, connect them with diverse relationships in the body of Christ, and gather them into the corporate meetings of the church. In order to effectively reach the lost, we must obey the scriptural commands for personal evangelism, church life, and family life.
When we consider how to reach a lost generation, should we invent something alien to Scripture? On the contrary, we should approach lost and broken people in the same ways that Jesus and His apostles did. Scripture does not suggest that we use a systematic, age-segregated method to reach lost youth, but rather an integrated method of bringing them into the body of Christ. – from A Weed in the Church, 215-219.
One of the best Christian books I have ever read. This beautiful story written about people who are struggling with many of the difficult choices that young people everywhere are facing. Sex, drugs, doing what you want when you want and thinking that these are good times. Everyday these ideas are placed out in the television world, magazines and on street corners as a wonderful way to live your life. Take no responsibility for your actions is becoming the worlds refrain. Someone else will do it sounds good to me. But what if there is another way? What if it was (me) that could help. What if it was me who could help make the change? What if I did not have to have the (credit) for any of the good things that I just did to help out? What if asking our Father in Heaven to change our way of thinking and our actions would help us to gain the peace our souls so desperately need? Many life lessons are reflected in this wonderful story.
There's a silver lining for the younger generation struggling to find a decent job, affordable home and a sense of security: many of the world's most respected policy advisers understand their plight.
The International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Institute for Fiscal Studies are chief among the respected organisations that have published reports putting the growing financial burdens faced by young people to the fore.
It's true that in-depth studies of how to improve education, skills and general employability drop off the thinktank production line almost every month. And government ministers say they worry about it, hence the apprenticeship levy on businesses to promote in-work training.
Revealed: income for young British families falls as pensioners prosper Read more
But practical support for the victims of the modern market economy is not enough, and the global thinktanks know it. They recognise that a fundamental shift in the balance of power is needed to rescue young people and, by that virtue, the rest of society. And that means a reshaping of what we tax and when we tax it.
Not so much because they believe fairness is a goal in itself – more because their analysis tells them that the accumulation by certain groups of property and pension wealth, kept out of the clutches of the tax authority for the benefit of their children, creates a debilitating system of winners and losers. This system forces millions of young people into a new kind of serfdom, killing any chance of the team spirit needed to improve productivity.
This accumulation of wealth, not only by the top 1% identified by Thomas Piketty in his book Capital, but also by a broader group of middle-income earners over the age of 55 – the baby boomers – needs to be addressed. It is time to ease the taxes on income, making work pay, and start to look seriously at the best ways to limit the gains from property and savings.
At the moment, politicians are in thrall to the baby boomers and, to the dismay of the OECD and IMF, tax policy is going in the opposite direction.
Take the changes to university education funding as a case study. Developed by the Liberal Democrats and seized on by a Tory leadership desperate to make savings, it shifts a large proportion of the costs to students, who must take out loans to fund themselves and then pay back the loan through a new tax system.
The first crop of graduates face a combined tax and national insurance rate of 41% on annual incomes above £21,000, compared with the 20% income tax and 12% national insurance paid by non-graduates.
A recent announcement by George Osborne makes a bad situation worse. Should a graduate complete a master's degree (pdf), they would need to pay another 6% from their income (over a set threshold) to cover the extra debt on top of the 9% for their bachelor's degree.
It is another instance of young people paying through the nose for something that the previous generation had for free. And soon the situation will worsen when ministers, under pressure from the Russell Group of universities, allow the annual fees cap to rise above £9,000, leading to even bigger loans and a bigger bill for future generations to pay.
It's not hard to understand why Osborne would want to protect the accumulated savings of the older generation from extra taxes at the expense of the young. Older people vote, and in large numbers. At the last election, the over-55s made up more than half of the electorate.

So it may need another government before a tax on property sits alongside income tax, national insurance and VAT as the main revenue earners. Not stamp duty, which only taxes transactions and hinders the movement of young workers around the country while inflating estate agents' commissions, but an annual tax on property with the promise that those in work get to keep more of their wages.
Many analysts inside the OECD and IMF agree on this, aware that 70 years of wealth accumulation has brought the west to a point where trading in assets – the stocks and bonds in pensions funds and ever-inflating property – is more financially rewarding than working for a living. That needs to end or the UK, like other developed nations, will continue to allow the desperate search for income and security from ever-greater wealth to create a society that is poorer and desperately insecure.
A former television reporter from Arkansas is accusing Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonInviting Kim Jong-un to Washington Howard Schultz must run as a Democrat for chance in 2020 Trump says he never told McCabe his wife was 'a loser' MORE of groping her in 1980 in a new interview with Breitbart News.
Leslie Millwee alleges that the former president groped her on three separate occasions while she worked as a reporter for a television station in Fayetteville, Ark. At the time, Clinton served as the state's governor.

Millwee's interview was published the same day as the final presidential debate between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' Former Sanders campaign spokesman: Clinton staff are 'biggest a--holes in American politics' MORE and Republican nominee Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE. She gave the video interview to Breitbart News, the conservative site formerly led by Trump's campaign CEO, Steve Bannon.
She alleges that after a series of inappropriate comments, Bill Clinton confronted her on three separate occasions in a small room at her station, both touching himself and grabbing her as she protested. She added that after Clinton sought her out at her apartment at night, she decided to change jobs.
Trump has been battling accusations from more than half a dozen women that he kissed and groped them without their consent.
He has denied all of the stories and said that a 2005 video in which he can be heard talking lewdly about sexually grabbing women was just “locker room talk.” At the second presidential debate with Hillary Clinton, he said he has never sexually assaulted a woman.
Trump has also battled the accusations by firing back at Bill Clinton, whose long political career includes numerous charges of unwanted sexual advances toward women.
Trump invited three women who have accused Clinton of sexual misconduct to the second debate. Clinton has denied the accusations of those women.
The GOP presidential nominee has frequently questioned why his accusers did not share their stories earlier. And he's dismissed friends of the accusers who say the accusers spoke privately about the incidents when they happened.
The Breitbart report includes former co-workers confirming Millwee's account. And during the interview, she said that the treatment of other Clinton accusers by both Bill and Hillary Clinton led her to stay silent even as others accused him of similar acts.
"I was very prepared to go forward then and talk about it, and I watched the way the Clintons and Hillary slandered those women, harassed them, did unthinkable things to them," Millwee said.
"I did not want to be part of that.”

Did Santorum Win Big Or Win Squat? What's A Nation To Believe?
Enlarge this image toggle caption Whitney Curtis/Getty Images Whitney Curtis/Getty Images
Pity the poor news junkie, waiting bleary-eyed at the witching hour, wondering how to feel about the latest events in the Republican nominating contest.
One news source — let's say it's a cable news operation — says the latest round of GOP presidential preference contests is a huge boost to the flagging fortunes of Rick Santorum, the winner of the night's trifecta. The cable outlets all air tape of Santorum's triumphant victory speech again and again. He surely looks like a winner.
And what a great made-for-TV story it is, too. A neck-snapping turnaround for the former senator from Pennsylvania, who had peaked in Iowa five weeks ago and promptly disappeared. Lacking money and organization, he finished out of the money in New Hampshire, South Carolina, Florida and Nevada.
Now he roars back and wins big in Missouri and Minnesota, two middle-sized states that might claim to speak for the mainstream of the Midwest. Even more impressive is his narrower win in Colorado, a Western state Mitt Romney had won in 2008.
But wait! Some other news sources — not locked in the life-and-death struggle of cable news — say it was all meaningless. No delegates were chosen or committed or bound (or whatever it is they do with delegates at this stage of the game).
How can that be? It's one thing to be told at midnight that a race is too close to call. That's suspenseful, and suspense is good for keeping us all up and watching. But it's another thing entirely to be told a race, however close, is essentially meaningless. Who wants that?
And more to the point, who's right about this?
Well, both sides can claim some facts for their case. Santorum clearly dominated the results in Missouri, beating runner-up Romney by 30 percentage points in the "beauty contest" primary there. Delegates will actually be chosen by another process in mid-March, but never mind. This was clearly Santorum's night, and he might just do well in the delegate selection, too.
In Minnesota, Santorum was the guy for 45 percent of those who turned out for caucuses. He walloped second-place finisher Ron Paul by 18 percentage points. Supposed national front-runner Romney was a weak third with just 17 percent. Newt Gingrich, supposedly the main challenger to national front-runner Romney, got just about 11 percent.
Most surprising of all, Santorum built an early lead in the rural counties of Colorado and survived a Romney surge from the urban areas to prevail with just under 40 percent. Gingrich and Paul trailed with barely a dozen points each.
All that seems pretty obvious and pretty simple. Big, big night for Santorum. So, the kid stays in the picture.
In fact, if you were watching CNN, you got the impression you should be ordering your tickets for his inauguration.
OK. Take a breath. Now let's take another look at those facts.
Not only was the Missouri vote a "beauty contest," binding no delegates, but the turnout there was less than 6 percent of the voting-age population — a paltry number for a statewide primary. Moreover, Missouri's results were a bit askew because Gingrich did not get on the ballot.
In Minnesota, a state of about the same population, the party caucuses drew just over 50,000 participants (about a fifth as many as in Missouri). That was a little over 1 percent of the voting-age population. Again, no commitment of delegates.
In Colorado, again a state of roughly 5 million people, about 65,000 turned out, but that was still well below 2 percent of the voting-age population. Delegate haul? Well, zero for now.
That's not much of a plebiscite. And it could be a poor indicator of the sentiment of most Republicans and independents. What it measures instead is the ardor of that fraction of the GOP vote that is willing to turn out for a nighttime caucus where no delegates are actually being decided.
Sharp-eyed news consumers will be quick to note that the national opinion polls rarely have more than a thousand respondents or so. The really good ones may push out to 1,500 interviews.
So why is 50,000 or 65,000 somehow a lousy sample?
Simple answer: Because that sample may be anything but representative of the rest of state. The science behind polling is that the phone calls go out via random digit dialing. In theory, anyone with a phone might be called. And pollsters have gotten much better about including cellphones in their work.
In a caucus, however, like the ones in Minnesota, the people who show up are predominantly the people most passionately committed to a candidate or an issue. In Minnesota GOP caucuses, that issue is usually abortion. So this week's caucus told us less about Minnesotans' preference among candidates and more about the feelings of the anti-abortion movement.
Lacking exit or entrance polls, we cannot say for certain what issues drove the vote to Santorum this week. But it has never been a secret that Santorum was the candidate most devoted to the anti-abortion cause. He is, in some respects, its secular patron saint.
Moreover, anyone doubting the persistent potency of the abortion issue in national politics need only consider the big news stories of the past week. The few days of February to date have brought not one but two significant controversies over abortion.
One began when the Susan G. Komen charity that fights breast cancer decided to cut off funding to Planned Parenthood, which includes abortion among its services. Within days, Komen had backtracked, and its anti-abortion vice president had resigned.
The other abortion-related dust-up threatens to last much longer. It was raised when Catholic bishops and other religious authorities objected to a rule in the new federal health care law requiring religious organizations that hire people outside their faith to offer those employees health insurance plans that cover contraception, including the so-called morning-after pill.
The Komen issue briefly energized the pro-abortion rights forces. The birth-control insurance mandate on religious institutions will do the same for anti-abortion activists in the weeks and months ahead.
And for the moment, at least, that movement has another cause and a new hero in Rick Santorum. Take him seriously now, because he will be around for a while. Just don't expect to see the party nominate him in Tampa.
The English shires and Labour's northern heartlands led Britain out of the European Union in a victory for middle England.
Despite Britain's biggest cities backing a Remain vote at yesterday's historic referendum, the country overall headed for the Brexit door.
The results caused immediate turmoil in the markets as the pound collapsed by more than 10 per cent in the hours after the polls closed and the FTSE-100 braced for heavy losses.
Nigel Farage - who earlier appeared to concede defeat - made a jubilant victory speech at around 4am declaring it was a 'victory for ordinary people'.
Tory constituencies across the south and midlands voted for Brexit in huge numbers.
Places such as Wellingborough, West Somerset and Chesterfield all voted for leave by more 60 per cent.
The referendum map was painted blue for Out across vast swathes of England - despite London and Scotland being bright yellow.
Mr Farage told a jubilant Leave.EU rally in central London: 'Dare to dream that the dawn is breaking on an independent United Kingdom.
'This, if the predictions now are right, this will be a victory for real people, a victory for ordinary people, a victory for decent people.

(CNN) A picture is starting to emerge of the suspected gunman in a deadly mass shooting at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas.
Two law enforcement sources briefed on the investigation identified the shooter as Devin Patrick Kelley, 26.
Kelley was once a member of the US Air Force, spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said. He served in logistics readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, starting in 2010.
Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, killed 26 people at a Texas church, police say.
Kelley was court-martialed in 2012 for two counts of Article 128 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, assault on his spouse and assault on their child, Stefanek said. Kelley received a bad conduct discharge, confinement for 12 months and a reduction in rank, she said. The Air Force did not provide a date of the discharge.

Despite his vehement claims on Twitter that he was assaulted inside the Puneboundaircraft,University Students Union (JNUSU) presidentdid not lodge any complaint with the. However, his friend Dheeraj Sharma from Gurgaon filed a non-cognisable case againstfor assaulting Kanhaiya, while Deka also filed a case against Kanhaiya and hisfor threatening him. Deka has also refuted all claims that he is an ardent supporter of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Meanwhile, joint commissioner of police (law and order)flatly turned down Kanhaiya's claims, calling them false and exaggerated. In a press conference at his office, Bharati told Mirror, “People like Kanhaiya Kumar, who are visible in public life, should verify such claims before making allegations through social media. After the inquiry, we have found out that his claims are false. A senior police inspector at Sahar police station requested Kanhaiya to lodge a police complaint but he refused — his friend reported an NC.”Bharti also expounded on what had actually taken place on the flight, going by the inquiry and statements from eyewitnesses and all involved parties. “When the flight halted at Mumbai airport for half an hour, Deka got up to meet his friends who were sitting in the rear of the flight. Deka, (31), software engineer, is a resident of Kamrup district in. He is working with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) inand he was going to Pune on business with 17 of his colleagues. When he got up, he tripped on Kanhaiya's foot as Deka himself has a leg injury. He caught at Kanhaiya's shoulder to steady himself. This act was misunderstood by Kanhaiya and his friends. A scuffle ensued and quickly escalated to manhandling.Finally, the captain decided to take them both off the flight, along with Kanhaiya's friend. Deka's friends, however, were allowed to remain.” Bharati confirmed that the injury on Deka's leg was cross-checked with doctors. When asked if the police would take action against Kanhaiya for tweeting false information, he said, “We will consult our legal advisers, but Kanhaiya may insist that he was assaulted. The question is why didn't he come forward to file a case?” Bharati also clarified that Kanhaiya's medical test was not conducted as he hadn't made an official complaint.“Deka was not even aware that the person sitting next to him was Kanhaiya Kumar. He has heard of Kanhaiya, but did not recognise him. He certainly did not trip over him on purpose,” he added.According to the police, Deka lodged an NC complaint against Kanhaiya and his friends, “Deka claimed that Kanhaiya and his friends warned that they would ‘take care of him' when he returns to Kolkata,” cops said. Police also denied that Deka has any connections with the BJP.Talking to the media at the airport, Deka termed the entire incident a cheap publicity stunt on Kanhaiya's part. “I am the victim here. I'm an engineer working with TCS and our tickets were booked by the company. My entire schedule was thrown off by Kanhaiya and his friends as I was deplaned and had to travel by road. Why would I want to hurt him? I didn't notice his leg and tripped. I have a thigh injury and they assumed I attacked him and started abusing me,” he said.When asked about his alleged political connections with BJP, Deka said, “I have never even voted because I work in Kolkata and could not travel to Assam during elections? I have no such connections.”of India leader from Mumbai who was at the airport to see Kanhaiya off, said, “There are rumours that the fight broke out over the window seat. This is all rubbish as the seats were already allotted. We got a call from Kanhaiya's friends that he was assaulted and so we waited till they came off the flight. There was no reason for Jet Airways to offload Kanhaiya and his friends. When asked if there was a refund on the tickets, Reddy said it would be looked into once the rally was over.█ Deka was not even aware that the person sitting next to him was Kanhaiya Kumar. He has heard of Kanhaiya, but did not recognise him. He certainly did not trip over him on purpose
When the first sirens of the day wailed through Tel Aviv Thursday morning a few minutes before 8 a.m., a number of Tel Avivians were still in bed. This is, after all, the city of bohemians – the laid-back enclave of waiters, actors and start-up dreamers – and for many, the days start late.
After they had scurried into their bomb shelters and counted four very loud booms from Iron Dome interceptions, however, Tel Aviv's denizens returned to doing what they do best. Within minutes, the sidewalk cafes were full of diners ordering Israeli breakfast, the buses were chugging down the boulevards and the city's coffee kiosks had lines of bleary-eyed patrons waiting patiently for their lattes and croissants.
Here in Tel Aviv, the city often referred to as “The Bubble” because of its insulation from so much of the ugliness of Israel, the atmosphere is deflated but not popped.

“The mood in Tel Aviv is great,” says Riki Shemesh, an Israeli expat currently living in Hong Kong who arrived in Israel for a visit on Monday. “I can't say it couldn't be better, because of course it could be. But we are looking for peace, we are very confident to be in our land, and we are very sorry for how Hamas is reacting.”
Shemesh was enjoying lunch with her two daughters at Café Xoho, a sweet establishment popular with expats that is tucked onto a side street between the city's upscale shopping boulevards of Dizengoff Street and Ben Yehuda. On most days during the lunch rush, Xoho is packed to capacity, with diners spilling out of its shabby-chic storefront onto the shady covered patio. This week, however, whiles business has been steady, owner Xoli Ormut-Durbin says she has definitely felt a slowdown.
“We have a lot of people chilling on their computers here, but usually at this hour it's totally packed,” Ormut-Durbin said, gesturing to several empty tables while picking up change from a customer. “I think everyone is less interested in leaving their houses right now. Generally in Tel Aviv, the alarm will go off and people will keep walking. But now it's been going on for a few days, so it's getting scarier.”
For some, that may be true. Other Tel Avivians, however, have done what they do best during the spike in hostilities this week: turning to social media to show just how unconcerned they are.
“Do I have to tip the sushi guy extra for delivering under rocket fire?” asked one Tel Aviv resident on the Facebook page Secret Tel Aviv, an open, mostly English-speaking community group with more than 40,000 members.
Another poster wrote: “A tip for Tel Avivians: when you hear the Tzeva Adom [code red siren]… lie down with your hands over your head. Do NOT worry about getting your dress and/or suit dirty. Seriously.”
In nearly the same breath, however, the page also hosted a lively and occasionally bruising debate about whether or not posting status updates about where rockets were falling would help Hamas better home in on its targets; if swimming in an open pool during rocket fire would offer sufficient protection; and if local television coverage of the World Cup was going to be affected by news of the fighting.
As Operation Protective Edge has worn on, and Tel Avivians – who experienced their first taste of Hamas rocket fire during Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012 – became increasingly accustomed to the wail of sirens and the boom of intercepted missiles overhead, some locals admitted to being surprised by their emotions.
“I'm working from home today,” admitted Nikki Avershal, 26, a business development executive at a Ra'anana-based start-up company. “Two sirens went off before noon and I don't want to get stuck out there.”
Most days Avershal, who lives in central Tel Aviv, takes a one-hour bus ride to and from her office, but with the increase in rocket fire, she decided Thursday morning that her commute was too much of a risk. She admits that she was worried her coworkers might think she was overreacting and make fun of her, but in the end decided she had to do what she thought was best.
“I don't want to be ostracized as someone who is panicky or hysterical, so I try to be calm. I don't think anything would happen, but at the same time, I don't want to find out if it would,” she says.
Avershal's apartment sits on the top floor of a eight-story building, and its windows offer a stunning panoramic view of the blue Mediterranean. From her roof, it's been possible this week to see the white smoky trails left behind by the Iron Dome's interceptions.
On the bottom floor of her building is a SuperSol grocery store, which means that she shares her bomb shelter with dozens of food shoppers. When a siren rang out earlier in the week, Avershal says she was amazed by how light-hearted the mood was underground.
“We saw all these people and no one was really fazed. Not even tourists who were in the supermarket. You know, you don't want to make light of the fact that all this is happening, because you don't want to accept it as normal. You want to stay on the edge of fear and scared, but you also don't want to panic.”
Polka dots. Mirrors. Pumpkins. Balloons. And long lines to see all of the above.
Yayoi Kusama, whose obsessively patterned and repetitive imagery has made her one of Japan's most celebrated artists, is opening her own museum in the Shinjuku neighborhood of Tokyo on Oct. 1. The news, reported by the Japanese culture website Spoon and Tamago on Thursday, was confirmed by the David Zwirner Gallery, which represents Ms. Kusama.
The museum, a five-story building designed by Kume Sekkei, was completed in 2014, but Ms. Kusama, 87, remained quiet about its purpose. (She perhaps alluded to the project in an interview in February with The Washington Post when she was asked what had been the highlight of her career. “It's still coming,” Ms. Kusama said. “I'm going to create it in the future.”)
The museum will be directed by Akira Tatehata, the president of Tama Art University and director of the Saitama Museum of Modern Art. The space will be dedicated to Ms. Kusama's own work, with two changing exhibitions each year, as well as one floor housing her popular “infinity rooms” and other installations. The top floor will house a reading room and archival materials.
The first exhibition, “Creation Is a Solitary Pursuit, Love Is What Brings You Closer to Art,” running Oct. 1 through Feb. 25, will show a recent series of paintings, “My Eternal Soul.” Tickets, priced at 1,000 yen, or about $9, go on sale on Aug. 28 and will be offered in time slots, suggesting that large crowds are anticipated.
Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski absolutely destroyed the hypocritical Dem talking point from last night's debate that Donald Trump's rhetoric on “rigged” elections is something new or unprecedented.
During the segment, the duo listed the numerous examples of past accusations of voter fraud against the Republican party that are being conveniently forgotten as the MSM discussed Trump's comments from last night's debate.

NEW YORK (JTA) — Latif Jiji looks over this year's crop at Chateau Latif with an expression of satisfaction.
If you've never heard of Chateau Latif, you're not alone. In fact, your favorite sommelier probably hasn't heard of it, either. It's not from the south of France, nor is it from Napa Valley. Rather, it's terroir is the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
As far as he knows, Jiji is the only winemaker in Manhattan who grows his own grapes on the island. The “chateau” is the brownstone that Jiji, 89, has shared with his wife, Vera, for the past 50 years, and the winery's grounds are their 15-by-45-foot backyard. The grapes come from a single vine, measuring more than 100 feet, that grows out of the garden, up the exterior wall and onto the roof.
Though the vine draws its water from the East River, its roots stretch back to a different waterway: the Shatt Al-Arab, the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, on which the Iraqi port city of Basra sits. It was there, in 1927, that Jiji was born into a Jewish family. He caught the winemaking bug from his father, who grew grapes and made wine in the courtyard of their home on Basra's main thoroughfare.

Jiji said his passion for wine “came from being Jewish in Iraq, celebrating Passover.” The making and drinking of alcohol, he explained, was something that separated Iraq's Jewish and Christian minorities from the country's Muslim majority, for whom alcohol is forbidden.
During his childhood, Basra was a sleepy town with about 10 synagogues and two Jewish schools, Jiji told JTA. Life in Basra was peaceful, he said, and the Jewish, Muslim and Christian residents of the city coexisted nicely.
But in 1941, after Iraq's short-lived alliance with Nazi Germany prompted a British invasion, rioting and looting that targeted Jewish neighborhoods and businesses broke out in the city. The pogrom became known as the Farhud — an Arabic term meaning “violent dispossession” — and while it was limited to looting in Basra, in Baghdad nearly 200 Jews were murdered and hundreds more wounded.
The Jijis were spared most of the violence, and they opened their home to friends and relatives fleeing more dangerous parts of the city.
“Jewish people, of course, were frightened,” Jiji said. “Friends and relatives started to come to our house; we had probably about 50 people. We gave up our beds, my siblings and I. I remember sleeping on the floor with only a towel for a pillow for days.
“A lot of people in the house started talking about what to do if we were attacked. We had no arms, but we had long sticks and at the end of the long sticks we put a bolt. We carried them around in case someone tried to break down the door, but no one did.“
Eventually the violence subsided and things returned to more or less normal within the Iraqi Jewish community. But in the years to come, the Farhud would be remembered as the beginning of a downward slide that led to the conclusion of 2,700 years of Jewish life in Iraq.
Jiji recalled listening on the radio to the 1948 United Nations vote to partition Palestine. Though his family cheered at the founding of the State of Israel, he knew his life In Iraq was over.
By the fall he was enrolled in college in the United States. Within the next decade, the rest of his family had fled to either the U.S. or Israel.
Jiji's life in the U.S. began in an unlikely place, at Hope College, a devoutly Christian school in the town of Holland, Michigan. He then transferred to the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology to earn a degree in engineering.
But during his junior year, he received an ultimatum from the Iraqi government: Return or have your Iraqi citizenship revoked. Having resigned his future in Iraq years before, the choice was obvious. But Jiji, rendered stateless, was left in limbo, possessing a student visa but lacking any other status.
Academia was one of the few avenues that remained open to him, so Jiji continued his studies, eventually earning his doctorate at the University of Michigan. Though he received U.S. citizenship in 1961, Jiji remained an academic, teaching engineering at various universities, including the City College of New York, where he worked until his retirement in 2014.
Jiji met Vera — the child of Jewish immigrants from Hungary, who grew up in the Bronx speaking Magyar at home — in 1954 at an event in New York for the radio station WBAI.
And while Jiji's vine was initially an homage to his father and Basra, it is also, like the four children they raised together, the product of the couple's marriage of more than 50 years.
Jiji's initial plan wasn't to make wine — he just thought the vine would add a bit of distinction to the backyard.
Vera had planned an elaborate garden for the backyard in 1977. Among various annuals and perennials, she planted a cherry tree and an evergreen.
“I showed it to my husband with great pride — then he took a tiny stick, planted it in the ground and it took over the whole thing,” she said of the vine.
Jiji's initial plan wasn't to make wine — he just thought the vine would add a bit of distinction to the backyard. Seven years later, however, it produced enough grapes that he thought he may as well give it a try. Jiji knew a bit about winemaking, having watched his father's primitive process, and he studied up on it, too, buying all sorts of books and pamphlets, as well as equipment.
That first harvest, in 1984, yielded 24 pounds of grapes, enough for nine bottles of wine. To date, the record is 712 pounds in a single harvest.
Vera is proud of Chateau Latif — after all, she came up with the name, a play on the Rothschild winery Chateau Lafite, whose vintages are among the most expensive in the world. (Chateau Latif's wine, by contrast, has no price point — Jiji doesn't have a license to sell it, so he shares it with friends and family.)
Aside from its location, the vine itself is something of a rarity — most wineries have a lot of space and therefore grow their grapes on numerous short vines.
“It's contrary to all traditions — from the Greeks, the Arabs, the Italians, the North Africans,” Jiji said of his vertical vine.
The wine is a dry white, made from Niagara grapes that are native to New York. Though often found in supermarkets, the grapes are uncommon in wineries. And while the taste fluctuates from year to year, the one constant descriptor is “fruity,” Jiji said.
As each summer nears its end, Jiji begins to measure the sugar content of the grapes on the vine. Once he has collected enough data, he determines the prime 10-day period to harvest the grapes, usually in mid-September. After the harvest, the grapes go to the basement, which houses the wine cellar, the machinery that Jiji uses to process the grapes into juice, as well as a one-of-a-kind refrigerator that he built himself. The juice ferments there, eventually becoming wine.
“It's contrary to all traditions — from the Greeks, the Arabs, the Italians, the North Africans.”
It takes up to two weeks for the sugar in the juice to turn into alcohol, and another nine to 12 months for the sediment to settle and the liquid to clear and begin to look like wine. During this fermentation period, the gases created during this process escape through a special valve that lets air out but not in.
And now, as the days shorten and the nights grow cooler, Jiji's house will again come alive with activity.
Friends and family will gather to pick the grapes from Jiji's vine and crush it into juice to begin the fermentation process. After a day's labor, they will gather for a home-cooked meal and enjoy some last years' vintage of Chateau Latif.
“It's a very unusual activity, the harvest, but people always enjoy it,” Jiji said. “This is our 33rd year, and there are people who have been with us for 30 years.”
SAN JOSE, Calif. – The San Jose Earthquakes announced today promotions and additions to the club's executive staff, establishing the largest senior leadership group in club history.

Using location for data and insights
Learn and adapt to your users using data. This doesn't just mean simple open metrics. Use location to understand where in the real-world your users engage most with your mobile push notifications.
In a world with over a million apps, it's important that you leverage every piece of data that you can around app engagement. You need to make data your best friend if you want to keep developing your app engagement strategy.
If you can get data around your app users that the majority of apps can't get access to then your onto a winner.
The truth is that many app engagement strategies fail to understand where their users go and how they behave.
Beyond basic engagement insights
For example, you might get feedback around how your users are opening your app push notification, using specific in-app features, or even just opening the app.
These insights might be based on time of day, or maybe you can even get a breakdown of this data based on audience type (depending on which service you use).
But what if you could get a better insight into the mind of your user at that time? Basic insights are great, but it doesn't always paint the perfect picture. You need to get as much data as possible if you are going to keep engaging your app users.
Location insights around app users can help drive mobile app engagement KPIs. If you can understand exactly where your users go and how they behave then you can create a better idea of how to engage them.
Engagement data that retains users
For example, let's say you have a sports app and you might send a re-engagement notification that performs reasonably well. You look at the data available to you and you see that a sizeable chunk of these notifications were opened between 12-3pm. Now that is a great insight, but what if you could learn more?
If you layer location insights around that data you might see a more useful pattern emerge. You could see that the majority of these notifications are opened in bars, and even more specifically sports bars.
Now you can really begin to hypothesise and fine tune your value proposition. You can see that the majority of your users are using your scores app whilst they are watching a game in a bar or sports venue.
This all links back to your app engagement strategy. You have a better idea of how and where your users get the most value from your mobile app, and this helps you to develop your app engagement strategy.
By understanding your user's behaviour you are much better placed to say which factors are most likely to boosts your app engagement KPIs.
2016 Mazda MX-5 colors leaked
Feb 1, 2015, 2:00pm ET
by Ben Hsu
Six shades shown in what appears to be a Japanese brochure.
Color options for the 2016 Mazda MX-5 have leaked online. The source contains Japanese writing and appears to be a home market brochure.
Hot on the heels of an official spec announcement of the eagerly anticipated 2016 MX-5 Miata comes an image from a color chart in a printed catalog. There appears to be at least six body color choices: Soul Red Metallic, Meteor Gray Mica, Snow Flake White Pearl Mica, Jet Black Mica, Dynamic Blue Mica, and Sunflower Yellow.
Soul Red is the color that pre-production prototypes have used as their showcase hue, but also an identifying shade on other cars like the Mazda2, Mazda3, Mazda6 and CX-5 and CX-3. As on those vehicles, it appears there will be a extra cost item added onto the sticker price. Though no pricing has been announced, Soul Red carries a $300 premium on the Mazda6.
Several of the colors have names plucked from the outgoing generation MX-5. Black Mica was a limited edition 2005 Mazdaspeed color, while Meteor Gray was on the 2014-15 MX-5 palette. Of course, these are the names for the Japanese market, and automakers are known to change official color names to make them more in sync with local tastes.
A convoy of Sikh truck drivers from Surrey, B.C. has completed a 2,262 kilometre return journeys, hauling almost $1 million worth of donated goods to Edmonton for families from Fort McMurray forced to flee the wildfire.
The donations come from BC's Sikh community, mostly from Surrey and Vancouver.
"When they see people are fleeing their homes, in B.C. the whole Sikh community got together for collecting food and clothing and whatever was needed," said Kulmit Singh Sangha, a member of Edmonton's Sikh community who welcomed the truckers midday Monday.

Surrey truck driver Rhanjit Dhillon was set to back his tractor trailer up to a loading bay at Edmonton's southside emergency donation centre.
Normally, Dhillon hauls containers of lumber.
But Monday, he was unloading brand-new pillows, children's clothes, toys, baby food, diapers and soft drinks. It was his second long haul trip from Surrey to help the victims of the Fort McMurray fire.
"I love it," said Dhillon. "I love helping the people. We feel they are all our families. They need our help."
Dhillon drove over the Rocky Mountains in a convoy with eight other drivers from Surrey, their trucks sporting colourful banners stating the message: BC Sikh Community Donation Drive for Fort McMurray.

Out on the highway, Dhillon said, the drivers were greeted with lots of horn honking from other vehicles and people saying things like "you are doing very well" and "we're very happy and excited."
Dhillon is urging other Sikh communities across B.C. to join in the generosity.
"The main fundamental principal of Sikhism is helping and sharing with others," said Sangha. "Sikhs have been blessed by coming here to this country that has bestowed on them so many opportunities. So why not share with people when they need it?"
On December 15, I chained my friends to the front door of the Oakland Police Department. Our group, called #Asians4BlackLives (http://a4bl.tumblr.com/), along with White and Latino allies answered a call from Black organizers for non-black allies to challenge police violence and institutionalized racism against black people. As Asian allies we believed it was critically important to put our physical bodies on the line so that Black organizers could bring their message directly to the source, that Black Lives Matter.
Two hundred and fifty people made up of Asian, white, Latino, black, elderly and disabled people, protested police violence that rainy morning. Through coordinated and disciplined direct action, our goal was to occupy the space for 4 hours and 28 minutes — 4 hours for the amount of time that Mike Brown was left dead on the road and 28 minutes to symbolize the killing of a black person by police, security or vigilantes every 28 hours. Nearly 40 of us were arrested, cited, and released. We succeeded in shutting down the Oakland Police Department for 4:28 hours.
It felt powerful and beautiful. The feeling of solidarity was deep. Although our tone was serious and disciplined, I was joyous inside as people expressed their support. An elderly African-American woman came up to us and shook our hands. When the Black Brunch protestors lock-stepped in to the protest, we were all moved to tears by the pure power of their action. They were tight and choreographed, practiced and militant. They chanted and sang and the hundreds of allies chanted in unity. Black Brunch protesters called out “Allies, are you with us?” to a resounding “YES!” They spoke out the names of all the murdered black lives by police. A flag of the portraits of some of those people: Oscar Grant, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Renisha McBride, and Alan Blueford waved on an occupied flagpole.
We Desis come out of a legacy of civil disobedience and struggle. The very tactic began in South Africa in the early 1900s, where Indians and Africans struggled together against Apartheid. My Bengali family were Freedom Fighters against British colonial rule. That story has been passed down through many branches of my family, and there are some members who today are still standing up for justice.
Our presence in the United States is made possible directly by the civil rights struggles of the early 1960s. My parents and I immigrated to the U.S. in 1965, the same year that civil rights activists helped force the US government to overturn racist policies allowing only 100 immigrants from India per year. Asians owe a debt to African-Americans, for paving the way for our ability to be in this country.
The legacy of resistance to oppression is in my blood, and I know I need to continue that legacy to do my best to fight for Black Lives in the U.S., my chosen country.
As my fellow #Asians4BlackLives arrestee Gopal Dayaneni puts it, “The legacies of domination in Africa, through slavery and the continued legal, political, economic, cultural and police war on Black communities means that the path to freedom for everyone travels through freedom for Black people. When Black Lives truly matter, then all lives will matter.”
Our communities have also been targeted and profiled, and some of us continue to live in a climate of fear. But we Desis must recognize the relative privilege that we and other Asians have in the U.S. The mainstream props us up as the “Model Minority.” Our communities are being used so that the dominant narrative can remain intact which blames black people for poverty, which in turn justifies police profiling of black people.
We cannot allow ourselves to be used in this way — and if we remain silent, we are consenting to the daily violence and brutalization of black people. As members of a community of immigrants in this country, families like mine have directly benefited from anti-Black racism. By perpetuating the mythology of the American Dream, we have been allowed to climb up the economic and social ladder and perpetuate the systematic racism against Black people.
We are on the brink of a new civil rights movement. If you are compelled to show support and solidarity at this critical moment, to make a stand for Black Lives and the liberation of all our communities, then there are many ways to engage.
I was able to participate in an intense, practiced, and disciplined direct action that involved a high risk of arrest. Not all of us can do that — but we can all play a part by talking to your families and communities (questions to consider for such conversations), reading thought-out intelligent articles about the issue, making art, writing, or holding up a placard that says South Asians for Black Lives and posting it on social media. Creative actions can take many forms.
There are also many indispensable, legally safe roles that support direct action organizing. Every action is backed by a team that might include: artists, media and communications folks, video editors, people who can navigate social media, medics, legal observers, jail support providers, cooks, childcare providers, and more. All of these roles are equally important.
#Asians4BlackLives are demanding an end to state sponsored violence and echoing the national demands coming from the community in Ferguson. We need our communities to join us in challenging anti-black racism by talking with your family and co-workers, showing up to a protest, or supporting organized direct actions like the one we participated in, to call for an end to the war on black people. Our liberation depends on the liberation of black people.

The relentlessly absurd election news cycle of 2016 led many readers to be skeptical of an 18 October 2016 news account reporting that a bus chartered either by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) or by the Hillary Clinton campaign had dumped human waste into a Georgia sewer:
pic.twitter.com/OOvwFSPt5n UPDATE: The latest on a report of a bus chartered by the DNC dumping sewage into a storm drain: https://t.co/iJVK3coQtm — FOX 5 Atlanta (@FOX5Atlanta) October 18, 2016
However, as the tweet embedded above demonstrated, the claims weren't coming from fly-by-night fake news sites, but rather from legitimate news outlets such as Denver television station KUSA, who reported
Hazmat crews in Gwinnett County were called to clean up waste left behind by a Democratic National Committee bus. According to a Lawrenceville Police Department report, officers were called to the O'Reilly Auto Parts at 525 Grayson Highway after receiving reports that an RV was illegally dumping its sewage into the storm drain. An employee of the auto parts store told the responding officer that he watched the RV stop in the turn lane of Grayson Highway in front of the store and spill raw sewage onto the roadway and into the storm drain. Pictures taken by the store employee showed that the RV featured pictures of Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her running mate Tim Kaine. The officer stated that a large amount of drying toilet paper was on the roadway where the RV had been and a "foul smell" was left in the air. Gwinnett County Fire Hazmat units cleaned up the spill.
By the time the claim went national, media outlets such as the Washington Post began injecting levity into the story:
Through the window inside O'Reilly Auto Parts, manager Mike Robins witnessed it all. He watched Tuesday morning, about 9:30, as a big blue bus advertising Hillary Clinton's face eased up in front of his shop and parked on the side of Grayson Highway. He watched, according to a police report obtained by Fox 5 Atlanta, someone gets off that bus and fiddle with some sort of mechanism. And he watched — then smelled — a thick liquid pour from the bus's belly. Then Robins pulled out his camera and started snapping photos. He was about to expose the Democratic National Committee's latest leak.
With respect to the veracity of the waste-dumping bus claim, a DNC spokesperson issued a statement on 19 October 2016 confirming the reports:
This was an unacceptable mistake and we apologize to the Lawrenceville community for any harm that was caused. We are taking corrective action with the charter bus company to prevent this from ever happening again and contacting local officials to determine the best course of action.
Atlanta station WAGA confirmed that police deemed the dumping action hazardous and said it constituted a city violation but added that the circumstances behind the dumping (i.e., whether it was intentional or due to equipment malfunction) had not yet been determined:
There is a violation, there is a city violation for dumping materials into the storm drain system, obviously this feeds into streams,” said Capt. Jeff Smith. Police said they are working with the Gwinnett County Storm Water and the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, to try to prevent the waste from entering the water supply. The Lawrenceville Police Department opted to send the case to Georgia's EPD, although admits there apparently was a violation. “We'll have to talk to the charter bus company and determine what happened and why,” said Kevin Chambers with Georgia's EPD. Chambers said he couldn't speculate if there was a violation until they are able to fully determine what happened.
Jay Inslee Is Correct That Clean Energy Grew Twice As Fast As The Rest Of The Economy
The Associated Press recently presumed to fact-check Washington state Democratic candidate for Governor Jay Inslee for noting that the U.S. "clean-tech sector grew twice as fast as the regular economy between 2003 and 2010." But Inslee's statement is correct -- it was AP that bungled its facts by confusing two terms in a report from the Brookings Institution.
AP noted that Inslee invested in SunPower, a solar company that has recently experienced layoffs, and suggested that, despite his long focus on clean energy, this investment was the reason that Inslee touted federal policies that encourage clean energy growth.
After claiming that SunPower shows the "risk" of investing in clean energy, AP tried to fact-check Inslee's statements on clean energy growth:
Inslee has said voters need to look at the green industry as a whole, not just the fate of individual companies. He's noted that the clean-tech sector grew twice as fast as the regular economy between 2003 and 2010. But that number doesn't give the whole picture. In a Brookings Institution analysis of the industry last year, researchers determined that the overall clean-energy sector added jobs at an annual rate of 3.4 percent over that seven-year time frame, and the figure lagged the national economy's 4.2 percent annual growth. Inslee has chosen to focus on the growth in a small subset of that industry -- newer clean-tech firms -- that account for less than 10 percent of total jobs in the industry. [Emphasis added]
But AP confused the rate of growth for what Brookings called the "clean economy," which included sectors such as organic farming and public transit, for the rate of growth of the "overall clean-energy sector." As Brookings researcher Kenan Fikri previously told Media Matters, clean energy jobs "have grown at an average annual rate of 11.1 percent." A slightly broader grouping of 13 clean-tech jobs (which includes a smart grid, battery technologies, carbon storage and others) grew 8.3 percent annually, "more than twice as fast as the rest of the economy measured the same way," according to Brookings.
Anti-Semitic attacks hit an all-time high last year, more than doubling from the previous year's total to hit 1,168 incidents in 2014. And as the Paris attacks of last month continue to reverberate, there are fears within the British Jewish community that intolerance of Jews on Britain's streets is only set to increase.
The Community Security Trust who compiled the statistic, which includes everything from physical violence to desecration of graves, has said that it has received an “unprecedented” number of calls from British Jews fearful of a similar attack in Britain. Little wonder, perhaps, that some of Britain's Jews are choosing to leave the country for good.
The Telegraph has published an interview with one such family, the Goulds from Manchester. Simon, 52, has built a successful career in business in the UK, whilst his wife Honey, 49, works in marketing, alongside raising their two children, Arron, 18 and Angel, 16. Having lived in the same suburban home in Greater Manchester for their whole married lives, the Goulds will be leaving it behind this summer to start a new life in Arizona.
“It's a terrible wrench”, says Honey. ““I'm proud to be British. My parents live in London. Simon has lived his whole life in two streets of north Manchester. Our house is the only home our son and daughter have ever known. But we have to do this, not least for the sake of our children.”
Whilst anti-Semitic attacks were up 118 percent in 2014 from the previous year, the rise has been especially sharp in London and Manchester where there are large Jewish populations; the latter seeing a 79 percent increase in incidents alone.
It's a trend that the Goulds have noticed themselves. “The other week, I was standing in the queue at a large supermarket in Manchester when the man in front of me said, ‘F—— Jews, they're all over the place. They're thieves, they are taking over our property. They're everywhere,' ” says Honey. “I've no idea if he knew I was Jewish or not, but I was absolutely terrified, and fled.”
In another incident, a neighbours son was wearing his kippa (skull cap) in the street when a Polish man “just sprang forward and hit him”
“I know there are plenty of people who simply want to live a peaceful coexistence,” said Honey. “But there is so much anti‑Semitism in Britain, and it's coming from all sides. Our local Jewish schools look like prison camps. They're surrounded by wire fences. There are guards on patrol, some with dogs. On Saturdays, you see police walking the street with members of the CST. I don't want to sit at home panicking when my husband goes to the synagogue. I just want to live in peace.”
Simon, who sat on the northern board of the CST concurs with his wife. “I've been exposed to, and become familiar with, spiralling anti‑Semitism,” he says. “Eggs hurled from passing cars, swastikas on Jewish headstones, messages of hatred. Last summer, central Manchester – a place I love and have always lived in – became a flashpoint for virulent anti-Israel demonstrations. It was terrifying to see this on the streets of my home city.”
Although attacks peaked over the summer, fuelled by increased military action in Gaza, the figures show that incidents were already on the increase in the first half of the year, before the conflict flared up again. In February the words “Jewish slag” were daubed on a gravestone in Manchester, whilst in September a man was battered with a glass and a baseball bat, whilst being subjected to anti-Semitic insults.
Simon says that the rise in radical Islam is not the only driving force behind the attacks. He also points a finger at the left, who habitually conflate Israel and Zionism with the Jewish population, and the right, who may currently be “happy firing salvos at the Muslim population, but I know we are only one step away from their wrath,” he says.
Commenting on the CST figures, Home Secretary Theresa May insisted “Britain without its Jews would not be Britain,” adding “No one should live in fear because of their beliefs or who they are. These figures are deeply concerning and I am committed to working with Jewish community leaders and law enforcement to tackle anti-Semitism.”
This will not be the first time Honey has moved abroad to flee persecution. Born in London, her family moved to Tehran when she was eight. But at the age of twelve she and her younger brother arrived at school one day only to be sent home immediately. There, her mother, in tears, was waiting with packed bags. Honey and her brother were put on a plane to boarding school in Britain, and didn't see their parents for a year.
“I've known what it is to flee in fear. I don't want to do that again. I want to leave the UK now on my own terms.” She sadly reflects: “This was the place where I finally felt safe, that I could finally call home.”
The couple's children are stoic about the move. Angel is in favour of the move: “Of course it will be hard, but there's always Facebook to keep in touch. I'm looking at the bigger picture, how things are changing. I want to live in a place where I won't be judged by my religion, where I can hold my head up high.”
And her brother Arron has already accepted a place at the University of California, Berkeley, to study political science.
They are unlikely to be the only British Jewish family with this story to tell. Indeed, Simon has set up a website, www.emigrate-to-america.co.uk, offering free advice to others thinking of making the move.
“I am the fourth generation of Jew in my family to live in Britain,” he says. “Britain offered a safe haven, a chance for them to raise a family, build a home. I am eternally grateful for the refuge Britain and its government has given to the Jews. But I can't help feeling that the future is no longer here. The grandfather of one Jewish friend said ‘It's time to leave when you are no longer free to sit on a park bench'. I think that time is fast approaching. I'm leaving before I'm told that I have to go.”
Philippine National Police chief Director General Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa immediately sacked some members of the anti-illegal drugs unit of Metro Manila and Quezon City Police and sent them to Mindanao on the day he assumed office last Friday.
Dela Rosa ordered the relief of the members of the National Capital Region Police Office Regional Anti-Illegal Drugs Unit (NCRPO-RAID) and Quezon City Police District's Anti-Illegal Drugs Unit (QCPD-DAID) and transfer to different Mindanao provincial units.

A copy of the reassignment order was shown to INQUIRER.net on Tuesday.
President Rodrigo Duterte earlier identified two former QCPD chiefs as protectors of drug syndicates—Police Director Joel Pagdilao and Chief Supt. Edgardo Tinio.

Pagdilao was also ordered relieved as the director of the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) effective July 1.

The relieved anti-narcotics operatives will be assigned to the regional police offices of Zamboanga, Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, and Caraga.
The relief order was signed by Chief Supt. Fernando Mendez Jr., chief of the Directorate for Personnel and Records Management, and Chief Supt. Ramon Apolinario, Chief of the Directorial Staff.
Disgruntled members of QCPD DAID, however, are complaining about the transfer order, saying that it is unfair for Dela Rosa to assume that all personnel are involved in drugs.

About Project Carrot is a clone of the 1998 Windows and Mac video game Jazz Jackrabbit 2 by Epic MegaGames that aims to replicate the original game in spirit and functionality while embracing modern design choices and attempting to be extensible on its later stages. Originally started in 2013, Project Carrot was in works for about half a year before its development first slowed down and ultimately ground to a halt for a good while. In 2016, development resumed once again. Up to this point, Project Carrot has been entirely a single person project. The Project Carrot family comprises of the main game and several utilities that are more or less essential for running it. Project Carrot Anim Extractor (PCAE) is used to extract the required graphic and sound resources from the original game files, while Project Carrot Level Converter (PCLC) and Project Carrot Tileset Converter (PCTC) convert .j2l and .j2t level and tileset files to Project Carrot's native formats. Additionally, a native level editor, Carrot Creator, has been planned. Project Carrot is still very much an in-progress project, and thus only a fraction of the features of the original game are supported. The current features include: Basic single-player gameplay with one of the three official characters
Close to complete JJ2 tileset and layer configuration compatibility
tileset and layer configuration compatibility Most level traversal events, like vines, springs, warps, and destructible scenery implemented
Four of the nine official weapons available at varying stages of completion

Development The source code for Project Carrot is available at its GitHub repository. The readme file for the repository details the requirements for compiling the game yourself. GitHub also hosts the source code for PCAE, PCLC, and PCTC. Project Carrot projects are built on Qt, a comprehensive framework for a wide array of software; SFML, an easy-to-use yet still efficient multimedia library; and BASS, a powerful audio engine. Each of these is available to all three major platforms — Windows, macOS, and Linux — making it possible to compile and run Project Carrot on each of them. Due to the currently volatile nature of the project structure, third-party contributions are discouraged at this time. This may change on a later date.
Team New Zealand have taken a 1-0 lead in the America's Cup match against Oracle Team USA in emphatic fashion.
Racing in light winds on Sunday (NZ time), the Kiwis won both of the day's races, and were largely untested throughout. That bodes well for their chances of reclaiming the Auld Mug, which they last held in 2003.
They led from start to finish both times, erasing their one-race deficit and turning it into a one-race lead in the first-to-seven series.
Oracle skipper Jimmy Spithill was aggressive to begin the second race, after being outfoxed in the first, but he couldn't force Peter Burling into an error, and it was Team NZ who led at the first mark.

Once they were out in front, Team NZ could just focus on themselves and race their own race. It looked like they would have it easy for the second time in as many races, but on the upwind fifth leg, Oracle took advantage of a wind shift to close right up on them.
Team NZ just held on, however, and led at the mark, then took advantage of a poor Oracle gybe to ease away and claim the win, by 1m 28s.
Oracle will now be searching for answers as they seek to get their first win on on the board on Monday, where there are two more races before the match takes a five-day break.
GILLES MARTIN-RAGET/ ACEA 2017 Team NZ helmsman Peter Burling got the better of Jimmy Spithill in the start box on day one of racing in the America's Cup final.
Team NZ skipper Glenn Ashby said his team's cyclors had put in a huge effort to make sure the team had the power they required.
"[The wind] was just so shifty and so puffy as we saw out there. [That meant] huge movements on both the daggerboards and the wing and the jib - you never actually ever stopped trimming something for the whole day, so those guys got an absolutely whipping today.
"We made a few mistakes around the track, obviously, and so did [Oracle]. It was one of those days where it was hard to string every single puff and every single shift together - you sort of had to let a couple go to make sure you played the longer game."​

Spithill said it had been a trying day.
"This [wind] direction's pretty notorious for being very gusty, there's some really big lulls out there, and that was obviously the case today. But it's the same for both boats, so you've just go to deal with it the best you can."
In the first race of the day, Spithill and Oracle got too close to the start line too early, and strayed over it before the clock hit zero, which earned them a penalty. Oracle had been expected to be the stronger boat in that phase of the race, so it came as quite the boost for Team NZ's hopes.
Serving that penalty left Oracle 13 seconds behind at the first mark, and at the end of the first downwind leg, that lead had grown to 32s.
Being so far out in front, Team NZ were able to sail their own race, and they didn't come under any pressure. They had a slight speed advantage upwind, of around 20 knots to 18.
Spithill opted for a split at the fourth gate, as he tried to force his boat back into the contest, but couldn't find the wind shift he needed. The lead was nearly two minutes at the fifth gate.
At the sixth gate, Team NZ made a mistake themselves, stalling as they gybed and allowing Oracle to catch up, but it was too little too late, as they won by 30s at the line.
Because Oracle finished top of the round-robin qualifiers in the challenger series, Team NZ began the America's Cup match on -1, while Oracle were on 0, effectively leaving the Kiwis needing to win eight races to the defender's seven to claim the spoils.

Five men arrested after alleged gang rape of a woman in Qatar
Five Indian men have been arrested in Qatar after reportedly gang raping a Filipina woman in her home, the Phillippines Embassy has confirmed.
The victim, a 32-year-old woman whose children lived back home, had been working here illegally and living in a shared apartment.
Earlier this month, five men entered her room, claiming to be Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officials, the embassy's Vice Consul, Melvin Almonguera, told Doha News.
The woman, who reported the attack to the embassy this week, said that, after asking to see her residency papers, the men took turns raping her.
It's believed the alleged attack took place on Aug. 10. The victim reported the crime two weeks later, giving police descriptions of the men involved.
The men were arrested soon afterwards. Philippines news network GMA has reported that the men were apprehended in a joint CID and Interpol operation, but Doha News been unable to confirm this.
According to Almonguera:
“The embassy is monitoring her case, and we'll do everything we can to assist her.
“We are arranging counseling support from the Qatar Foundation For Combating Human Trafficking, who have a specialist rape team.”
The victim will remain in Qatar to monitor the progress of the case, and would like to stay here to work, he added.
It is unclear what charges have been filed against the men, though in addition to assault, impersonating a police officer is also a criminal offense.
This is not the first time a violent crime like this has been reported to the embassy, though this type of case still remains uncommon in Qatar, Almonguera said.
The Ministry of Interior were not immediately available for comment.
Crime rates
Despite enjoying one of the lowest crime rates in the world, the number of reported crimes has sky-rocketed in Qatar in the past decade, due to the rapid increase in the country's population.
The crime rate jumped from 320 crimes per 100,000 people in 2001 to 2,355 crimes in 2010, the 2011 Sustainable Development Indicators report states.
Following the news of this case, the Philippines Embassy is issuing a warning to all nationals in Qatar to be on their guard when officials visit their home.
Almonguera said:
“It's important that everyone should look for identification from those who are trying to enter their accommodation or their homes. “And they should know that when the authorities conduct raids, they have female employees with them, and they show their ID. If anyone is in doubt, they can refuse entry.”

The Doctors: Dr. Travis Stork Dating Carrie Underwood
25country singing sensation and American Idol winner, has been seen out and about in New York City with. If that name sounds familiar you've either caught him as The Bachelor circa 2006 or as co-host on The Doctors, a new afternoon talk show.
Stork, 36 has a Nashville connection, having practiced ER medicine at Vanderbilt Medical Center. His latest television venture bills the ER Doc and his colleagues as 'America's medical dream team'. His cohorts include Dr. Jim Sears, Dr. Lisa Masterson and Dr. Drew Ordon. The show debut was in September 2008.
During Stork's tenure on The Bachelor, he whittled down a group of 25 women and chose Nashville kindergarten teacher Sarah Stone to be his wife. The dew was off the rose before the show finale hit the airwaves and the couple parted, fondly remembering the show as a "great experience in Paris and we'll never forget that".
Stork was photographed at one of Underwood's recent Carnival Tour concerts in Topeka, Kansas. He was sporting an all-access backstage pass around his neck. They were also seen at Stephen Starr's French bistro Parc in Philadelphia dining with friends.

The new trailer is available to view below.
VRFocus will continue to bring you the latest news on XING: The Land Beyond and other upcoming VR titles.
It's been three years since Billy Currington released his last album, but the wait is finally over for fans who are pining for new music from the 'Hey Girl' hitmaker.
This September, Currington will release a new album called 'We Are Tonight.'
With seven career No. 1 singles behind his name, Currington's upcoming album is highly anticipated by fans and music critics alike. 'Hey Girl,' the first single from 'We Are Tonight,' has already been released and it has remained in the Top 25 on the charts for five straight weeks. Judging by that success, the prognosis is looking good for the singer's new release.
Currington is working with three producers on 'We Are Tonight.' Even though that sounds hectic, he says he's happy to have worked with so many people on the album. "This album is the first time that I have ever worked with three different producers," the singer explains. "It wasn't planned, but just kind of happened that way. It was a great experience to be able to bring a different sound to this album and I hope the fans love it as much as I do."
The Grammy-nominated country star tapped into other songwriting talent on 'We Are Tonight.' Currington covered Jack Johnson's hit song 'Banana Pancakes,' and fellow country artist Willie Nelson adds his own two cents on 'It's Hard to Be a Hippie.'
'We Are Tonight' is set to hit the store shelves on September 17.

At 5:45 p.m., lost and running out of options, the hikers phoned 911 and reached the Yosemite Emergency Communications Center, which initiated a search and rescue (SAR). The first responding ranger established direct cell phone contact with the lost hikers and obtained their coordinates (location). The hikers could see the ranger's emergency vehicle lights at Tunnel View and rangers could see the hikers with the aid of their binoculars.
The ranger directed the hikers to head up hill until they reached the Pohono Trail but the hike was steep and wooded and the ranger lost sight of the hikers as they headed up. The ranger instructed the hikers on how to send coordinates or “pings” through their smartphone map applications but they were not able to figure this out, which made it necessary to call 911 every 20 minutes for progress tracking to ensure they were maintaining the proper heading. (911 lines are able to obtain coordinates from some cell carriers, in some instances with accuracy, when there is coverage and while this is an important search tool, never rely on cell phones in the backcountry.)
After 30 minutes of slow progress and with darkness approaching, additional SAR resources were ordered. Darkness arrived before SAR resources arrived, so the ranger instructed the hikers to remain in place after getting them to level ground about 200 yards from the trail. When the SAR team got closer, the ranger directed the hikers to blow their whistle until the SAR team located them.
At 9:20 p.m., the SAR team connected with the hikers; although cold and wet, the hikers were in good spirits. The SAR team gave them heat packs to warm the hikers and then walked them back to the parking lot.
What went wrong? Leaving the trail is a common mistake many visitors make. In this case, it was an attempted shortcut. Yosemite is defined by dangerous terrain and unless one is well acquainted with backcountry travel, including a good topo map and compass (GPS optional) do not leave the trail. If we cannot persuade you to stay on the trail for your own safety, can we convince you to stick to the trail to preserve Yosemite's fragile flora by not trampling it?
As mentioned earlier, the hikers lacked protection from the elements. Hypothermia is a very real possibility and hikers should always prepare for the worst extremes for the present season. You do not have to wear everything you bring, but do carry appropriate clothing in your pack.
Neither hiker carried a light source. Headlamps are powerful, inexpensive, and lightweight. Most hikers do not intend to remain out after dark, but hikers do not intend on becoming lost either. Hiking in the dark anywhere without a light is hazardous; in Yosemite's steep terrain, this can be deadly.
Know your equipment and be able to exploit your smartphone's features. Although there was cell coverage in this area, in many parts of the park, even in many frontcountry areas, this is not the case. Your cell phone might be a tool, but never depend on it.
Be able to navigate. The hikers did not carry a map or compass. Always, always, always be able to backtrack your original route. Do not try to force a solution. Hiking “down” as your solution is unproven hikers' lore and many Yosemite hikers have learned this the hard way, some at the cost of their lives. What went right? Once cliffed out, the hikers stayed in place and called 911 for help. This might seem obvious, but some hikers in similar circumstances have unsuccessfully attempted to descend steep terrain. While we appreciate self-sufficiency, we'd much rather help you before your situation worsens or becomes more complicated.
The hikers remained in contact with rangers through their fully charged cell phone.
They had food and water.
Perhaps their most important tool was their whistle. Without that whistle, another lightweight inexpensive device, locating them would have been a lot more challenging and kept them in the woods further into the rainy night.
Being prepared with the 10 essentials and knowledge of your terrain and weather is vital for having an enjoyable hike. On May 16, a mother and daughter were hiking to Inspiration Point when they sought a shortcut, lost the trail for over two hours, and became “cliffed out.” The steady rain and cold temperatures already made for a miserable day before their misadventure began. While hiking in the rain is generally not a problem, nor is it discouraged if one is properly dressed (i.e., waterproof and breathable outerwear and warm clothing underneath). However, the hikers were not dressed for precipitation and chilly temperatures. In any case, they eventually reached steep terrain, which made continuing downhill impossible.At 5:45 p.m., lost and running out of options, the hikers phoned 911 and reached the Yosemite Emergency Communications Center, which initiated a search and rescue (SAR).

Seven of the nation's top LGBT and civil rights organizations today have announced they are withdrawing support for ENDA after the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby ruling.
After 40 years, the LGBT community in part has decided that not only is ENDA not good enough, it's potentially dangerous because the legislation contains strong carve outs for religious organizations. In the wake of the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby ruling, ENDA could become a license to discriminate rather than the legal protection it was designed to be.
In a dramatic move today, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force announced it was dropping support for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. Hours later, a coalition of five LGBT legal and civil rights groups -- the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (GLAD), Lambda Legal, the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR), and the Transgender Law Center -- made a similar announcement. (Pride at Work announced they are dropping support after this article was published -- see below.)
The coalition of five groups calls their request "a simple one."
"Do not give religiously affiliated employers a license to discriminate against LGBT people when they have no such right to discriminate based on race, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic information," the group say in a joint statement just released. "Religiously affiliated organizations are allowed to make hiring decisions based on their religion, but nothing in federal law authorizes discrimination by those organizations based on any other protected characteristic, and the rule should be the same for sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. Religious organizations are free to choose their ministers or faith leaders, and adding protections for sexual orientation and gender identity or expression will not change that."
They say their "concerns are not hypothetical" and that "the American people oppose efforts to misuse religious liberty as an excuse to discriminate against LGBT people."
Increasingly, this is what employment discrimination against LGBT people looks like. Take the example of Matthew Barrett. In July 2013, Matthew was offered a job as food services director at Fontbonne Academy, a college prep high school in Milton, Massachusetts that is affiliated with the Roman Catholic Sisters of St. Joseph of Boston. Fontbonne Academy has employees and admits students of various faiths. Yet, two days after Matthew listed his husband as his emergency contact on the standard employment paperwork, and despite twenty years of work in the food services industry, his job offer was rescinded. Although nothing about the food services job involved religious rituals or teaching, Matthew was told by an administrator that the school was unable to hire him because "the Catholic religion doesn't recognize same-sex marriage." The current version of ENDA would authorize this sexual orientation discrimination.
The groups add that until the "discriminatory exemption is removed so that anti-LGBT discrimination is treated the same as race, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic information under federal workplace laws," they think "ENDA should not move forward in Congress."
That request will likely be granted, as Speaker John Boehner has stated he believes LGBT people -- as do the majority of Americans, wrongly -- are already protected and can't be fired for being LGBT. Boehner refuses to bring ENDA to the floor for a vote.
"In addition," the coalition states, "we will oppose any similar provisions at the state and local level. We are hopeful that the many members of Congress who support this historic, critically important legislation will agree that singling out LGBT people for an unequal and unfair exemption from basic workplace protection falls unacceptably short of the civil rights standards that have served our nation well against other types of discrimination for fifty years. We stand ready and eager to work with them to achieve the long-sought goal of explicit, effective federal non-discrimination protections for LGBT people."
Rea Carey, Executive Director, Task Force Action Fund, adds:
"The campaign to create broad religious exemptions for employment protections repeats a pattern we¹ve seen before in methodically undermining voting rights, women¹s access to reproductive health and affirmative action. It is time for fair minded people to block this momentum, rather than help speed it into law. We need new federal non-discrimination legislation that contains reasonable religious accommodation. LGBT people should have the same protections as those contained in Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Legal equality is legal equality."

Starting today, Sling TV subscribers can watch AMC and its marquee shows including The Walking Dead, Better Call Saul, and Mad Men. You don't need to pay anything extra for AMC; it's joining Sling's core channel lineup. That $20 package also bundles ESPN, CNN, TNT, TBS, Disney Channel, and other networks. AMC was a noticeable holdout when the Dish-owned internet TV service launched earlier this year, but both sides quickly reached a deal and in February announced that AMC was on the way. IFC, another channel covered in that agreement, is also launching on Sling TV today. And like AMC, it costs nothing extra.
Further, Sling has also launched its fourth $5 content add-on pack, and this one's called "Hollywood Extra." It includes EPIX, EPIX 2, EPIX3, EPIX Drive In, and Sundance TV. Like the previous kids, sports, and news packs, this one adds $5 onto Sling's regular monthly subscription. It too is available starting right now.
Taiwan-based Foxconn Technology Group, the world's largest contract manufacturer of consumer electronics, is reportedly planning a multibillion dollar investment in Michigan.
The investment, first reported by the South China Morning Post, comes a week after the electronics giant announced a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin.
The new investment will focus on automated vehicle technology, according to Foxconn founder Terry Gou.
The news comes as Michigan Republican Gov. Rick Snyder continues a nine-day trade mission in China. Snyder met with Chairman Gou and visited Foxconn in Shenzhen, according to his office.
“They had a great visit and very productive dialogue, but we don't have any official announcements to make at this time,” Snyder spokesperson Anna Heaton said.
President Donald Trump welcomed Foxconn executives to the White House July 26, where he announced a technology and manufacturing initiative.
During the meeting, Trump praised Foxconn for investing in the U.S.
“Foxconn joins a growing list of industry leaders who understand that America's capabilities are limitless and that America's workers are unmatched, and that America's most prosperous days are just ahead,” the president said alongside Gou at the time.
Foxconn's decision to build a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin, where they will make liquid crystal displays (LCD televisions), was a disappointment to people in Michigan hoping to lure the electronics giant to the state. Reports that the company is going to come to Michigan to invest billions in its autonomous vehicle technology is welcome news.

Wandering point on the Northern Hemisphere
[ citation needed ] Location of the North Magnetic Pole and the North Geomagnetic Pole in 2017.
The North Magnetic Pole is the wandering point on the surface of Earth's Northern Hemisphere at which the planet's magnetic field points vertically downwards (in other words, if a magnetic compass needle is allowed to rotate about a horizontal axis, it will point straight down). There is only one location where this occurs, near (but distinct from) the Geographic North Pole and the Geomagnetic North Pole.
The North Magnetic Pole moves over time due to magnetic changes in the Earth's core.[1] In 2001, it was determined by the Geological Survey of Canada to lie west of Ellesmere Island in northern Canada at .[2] It was situated at in 2005. In 2009, while still situated within the Canadian Arctic territorial claim at ,[3] it was moving toward Russia at between 55 and 60 kilometres (34 and 37 mi) per year.[4] As of 2017, the pole is projected to have moved beyond the Canadian Arctic territorial claim to .[3]
Its southern hemisphere counterpart is the South Magnetic Pole. Since the Earth's magnetic field is not exactly symmetrical, the North and South Magnetic Poles are not antipodal, meaning that a straight line drawn from one to the other does not pass through the geometric centre of the Earth.
The Earth's North and South Magnetic Poles are also known as Magnetic Dip Poles, with reference to the vertical "dip" of the magnetic field lines at those points.[5]
Polarity [ edit ]
All magnets have two poles, where the lines of magnetic flux enter and emerge. By analogy with the Earth's magnetic field, these are called the magnet's "north" and "south" poles. The convention in early compasses was to call the end of the needle pointing to the Earth's North Magnetic Pole the "North Pole" (or "north-seeking pole") and the other end the "South Pole" (the names are often abbreviated to "N" and "S"). Because opposite poles attract, this definition means that the Earth's North Magnetic Pole is actually a magnetic south pole and the Earth's South Magnetic Pole is a magnetic north pole.[6][7]
The direction of magnetic field lines is defined such that the lines emerge from the magnet's north pole and enter into the magnet's south pole.
History [ edit ]
Early European navigators, cartographers and scientists believed that compass needles were attracted to a hypothetical "magnetic island" somewhere in the far north (see Rupes Nigra), or to the Pole Star.[8] The idea that the Earth itself acts as essentially a giant magnet was first proposed in 1600, by the English physician and natural philosopher William Gilbert. He was also the first to define the North Magnetic Pole as the point where the Earth's magnetic field points vertically downwards. This is the definition used nowadays, though it would be a few hundred years before the nature of the Earth's magnetic field was understood with modern accuracy and precision.[8]
Expeditions and measurements [ edit ]
Early [ edit ]
The first expedition to reach the North Magnetic Pole was led by James Clark Ross, who found it at Cape Adelaide on the Boothia Peninsula on June 1, 1831. Roald Amundsen found the North Magnetic Pole in a slightly different location in 1903. The third observation was by Canadian government scientists Paul Serson and Jack Clark, of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, who found the pole at Allen Lake on Prince of Wales Island in 1947.[9]
Project Polaris [ edit ]
At the start of the Cold War, the United States Department of War recognized a need for a comprehensive survey of the North American Arctic and asked the United States Army to undertake the task. An assignment was made in 1946 for the newly formed Army's Air Corps Strategic Air Command to explore the entire Arctic Ocean area. The exploration was conducted by the 46th (later re-designated the 72nd) Photo Reconnaissance Squadron and reported on as a classified Top Secret mission named Project Nanook. This project in turn was divided into many separate, but identically classified, projects, one of which was Project Polaris, which was a radar, photographic (trimetrogon, or three-angle, cameras) and visual study of the entire Canadian Archipelago. A Canadian officer observer was assigned to accompany each flight.
Directing Project Polaris was its navigation leader, 1st Lieutenant Frank O. Klein, a World War II combat veteran. Incidental to the project and taken up at his own initiative was a study of northern terrestrial magnetism. The study was prompted by the surprise that the fluxgate compass did not behave erratically as expected. It oscillated no more than 1 to 2 degrees over much of the region.[10][11] With the cooperation of many of his squadron teammates in obtaining many hundreds of statistical readings, startling results were revealed:
The centre of the north magnetic dip pole was on Prince of Wales Island some 400 kilometres (250 mi) NNW of the positions determined by Amundsen and Ross, and the dip pole occupied a larger elliptical area,[clarification needed] with foci about 400 km (250 mi) apart on Boothia Peninsula and Bathurst Island.
Klein called the two foci local poles, for their importance to navigation in emergencies when using a "homing" procedure.[clarification needed] About 3 months after Klein's findings were officially reported, a Canadian ground expedition was sent into the Archipelago to locate the position of the magnetic pole. R. Glenn Madill, Chief of Terrestrial Magnetism, Department of Mines and Resources, Canada, wrote to Lt. Klein on 21 July 1948:
… we agree on one point and that is the presence of what we can call the main magnetic pole on northwestern Prince of Wales Island. I have accepted as a purely preliminary value the position latitude 73°N and longitude 100°W. Your value of 73°15'N and 99°45'W is in excellent agreement, and I suggest that you use your value by all means. R. Glenn Madill[10]
(The positions were less than 30 km (20 mi) apart.)

The Canadian government has made several measurements since, which show that the North Magnetic Pole is moving continually northwestward. In 2001, an expedition located the pole at . In 2007, the latest survey found the pole at .[12] During the 20th century it moved 1100 km, and since 1970 its rate of motion has accelerated from 9 km/year to approximately 52 km/year (2001–2007 average; see also Polar drift). Members of the 2007 expedition to locate the magnetic north pole wrote that such expeditions have become logistically difficult, as the pole moves farther away from inhabited locations. They expect that in the future, the magnetic pole position will be obtained from satellite data instead of ground surveys.[12]
This general movement is in addition to a daily or diurnal variation in which the North Magnetic Pole describes a rough ellipse, with a maximum deviation of 80 km from its mean position.[13] This effect is due to disturbances of the geomagnetic field by charged particles from the Sun.
As of early 2019, the magnetic north pole is moving from Canada towards Siberia at a rate of approximately 55 km (34 miles) per year.[14]

Exploration [ edit ]
The first team of novices to reach the Magnetic North Pole did so in 1996, led by David Hempleman-Adams. It included the first British woman Sue Stockdale and first Swedish woman to reach the Pole. The team also successfully tracked the location of the Magnetic North Pole on behalf of the University of Ottawa, and certified its location by magnetometer and theodolite at .[17]
The biennial Polar Race takes place between Resolute Bay in northern Canada and the 1996-certified location of the North Magnetic Pole at .[citation needed] On 25 July 2007, the Top Gear Polar Challenge Special was broadcast on BBC Two in the United Kingdom, in which Jeremy Clarkson and James May (and their support and camera team) became the first people in history to reach this location in a car.[18]
Magnetic north and magnetic declination [ edit ]
Magnetic declination from true north in 2000.
Historically, the magnetic compass was an important tool for navigation. While it has been widely replaced by global positioning systems, many airplanes and ships still carry them, as do casual boaters and hikers.[19]
The direction in which a compass needle points is known as magnetic north. In general, this is not exactly the direction of the North Magnetic Pole (or of any other consistent location). Instead, the compass aligns itself to the local geomagnetic field, which varies in a complex manner over the Earth's surface, as well as over time. The local angular difference between magnetic north and true north is called the magnetic declination. Most map coordinate systems are based on true north, and magnetic declination is often shown on map legends so that the direction of true north can be determined from north as indicated by a compass.[20]
In North America the line of zero declination (the agonic line) runs from the North Magnetic Pole down through Lake Superior and southward into the Gulf of Mexico (see figure). Along this line, true north is the same as magnetic north. West of the agonic line a compass will give a reading that is east of true north and by convention the magnetic declination is positive. Conversely, east of the agonic line a compass will point west of true north and the declination is negative.[21]
North Geomagnetic Pole [ edit ]
As a first-order approximation, the Earth's magnetic field can be modelled as a simple dipole (like a bar magnet), tilted about 10° with respect to the Earth's rotation axis (which defines the Geographic North and Geographic South Poles) and centred at the Earth's centre. The North and South Geomagnetic Poles are the antipodal points where the axis of this theoretical dipole intersects the Earth's surface. If the Earth's magnetic field were a perfect dipole then the field lines would be vertical at the Geomagnetic Poles, and they would coincide with the Magnetic Poles. However, the approximation is imperfect, and so the Magnetic and Geomagnetic Poles lie some distance apart.[22]
Like the North Magnetic Pole, the North Geomagnetic Pole attracts the north pole of a bar magnet and so is in a physical sense actually a magnetic south pole. It is the centre of the region of the magnetosphere in which the Aurora Borealis can be seen. As of 2015 it was located at approximately , over Ellesmere Island, Canada[22] but it is now drifting away from North America and toward Siberia.
Geomagnetic reversal [ edit ]
Over the life of the Earth, the orientation of Earth's magnetic field has reversed many times, with magnetic north becoming magnetic south and vice versa – an event known as a geomagnetic reversal. Evidence of geomagnetic reversals can be seen at mid-ocean ridges where tectonic plates move apart and the seabed is filled in with magma. As the magma seeps out of the mantle, cools, and solidifies into igneous rock, it is imprinted with a record of the direction of the magnetic field at the time that the magma cooled.[23]

In a video promoting the NBA 2K14 video game that was released Tuesday, Jordan said there's a long list of players he would've liked to have played one-on-one — Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Julius Erving, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade, Bryant and James, who dons the cover of this year's game. “I don't think I would lose,” Jordan said in the video, before smiling and adding, “Other than to Kobe Bryant because he steals all of my moves.” Jordan was listed as 6-foot-6 and 213 pounds during his prime. He averaged 30.1 points, 6.2 rebounds and 5.3 assists per game during his 15 seasons in the NBA.

Jordan, a six-time NBA champion and considered by many the greatest basketball player ever, has had a sponsorship deal with 2K Sports since 2011, when he first appeared on the cover of the popular game. James, 6-8, 250 pounds, has averaged 25.1 points, 6.6 rebounds and 6 assists during his first 10 seasons in the league. The 50-year-old Jordan, who was a five-time league MVP and is the majority owner of the Charlotte Bobcats, also shared the cover in 2012 with Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. This year will be the first time on the cover for James, a four-time league MVP who has led the Miami Heat to back-to-back NBA championships.

The Conservative Party exists for a reason. The most successful political party in the history of democracy has, for centuries, served the sole purpose of preserving the interests of wealth. I stress that when saying so I am not suggesting that it exists to serve the interests of business, as it would like many to believe, but wealth. This is the party of the rentier, not the business person.
What has to be acknowledged is that it has been remarkablty successful at doing so. It has been in office for 44 of the 72 years since 1945. It's borrowed far more than Labour in the process. And I am quite sure it does not give a damn: the Conservative Party does not exist to deliver policy or purity: it's goal is pragmatic power.
Only once in my lifetime has it forgotten this. That was the 1990s. Then, in a moment of madness (by its standards) it fell into partisan bickering when those who forgot the goals of the party did instead seek to pursue a dogmatic, nationalist, anti-EU agenda that drove it from the corridors of power for more than a decade. The natural order was disrupted.
It has never returned with its old confidence. If Cameron was a weak prime minister, holding office by the thinnest of margins, May is very much worse, despite still running a Tory administration. And that could still work if the Tories remembered what they were all about, which is compromise in the pursuit of power itself.
What Brexit negotiations convincingly reveal is that this is precisely what they have forgotten. They appear to have lost their negotiating ability whilst compromise appears beyond them. And all that remains on view is desperation and dogma. To put it another way, the Tories appear to have regressed to their 1990 state.
We can but hope that there is opprtunity in this. What we know is that the interest of the rentier does not align with that of most people in a country: by definition those who live off the back of the wealth created by others must be in a minority and have to oppress the majority. This is the malignant reality at the core of Tory politics.
What we also know is that this does not deny the minority power: money ensures they have influence beyond numbers.
But, that is only true when the opressor is single minded and the oppressed can be fractured in their opposition.
Or to put it another way, when there is a divided Tory party united opponents can overturn the hegemony of Tory power. This is the opportunity that exists now. This week showed it: the united opposition (because this was a multi-party showing) defeated the government on a motion on universal credit, from the vote on which all but one Tory abstained. They simply ran from the field.
If only this could be built upon the end of Tory rule is possible for a long time to come. I am not optimistic it can be done by one party alone. I know it is possible by an opposition willing to work for a greater good, which is to achieve freedom from the oppression of the rentier.
Is that enough to unite political opinion on the left? I wish I know.
I live in hope.
Three CNN journalists resign after Russia-related article retracted 9:07 AM ET Tue, 27 June 2017 | 00:44
Time Warner's news division CNN has accepted the resignations of three journalists after the publication of a Russia-related article that was later retracted, a CNN rep said on Monday.
The three journalists included Thomas Frank, the writer of the story; Eric Lichtblau, an editor in CNN's investigative unit; and Lex Haris, who oversaw the unit, the network had earlier reported.
The Russia-related story, published on Thursday, reported Congress was investigating the ties of a Russian investment fund to an aide of President Donald Trump.
CNN had reported an internal investigation by its management found that certain editorial processes were not followed when the article was published.
The report said CNN had deleted the story from its website on Friday night after its investigation.
Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday morning to lambaste CNN and accuse other media outlets of producing "fake news."
CNN's public relations team refuted Trump's ratings claim, also on Twitter.
The CNN story was replaced with an editor's note of apology to Anthony Scaramucci, the Trump aide who was reported to be investigated in the story.
Trump has been critical of CNN, calling the news outlet "fake news" and refusing to take a CNN reporter's questions at his first formal news conference earlier in the year after his Nov. 8 electoral win.
(CNN) Republican lawmakers and administration aides found themselves again Wednesday weighing the costs and benefits of remaining loyal to President Donald Trump, whose equivocal statements about neo-Nazis and white supremacists marked a dramatic shift in presidential rhetoric.
By Wednesday afternoon, most appeared to have made their calculation: deserting Trump now could only harm — and not help — their agendas or political fortunes.
Republican leaders in Congress, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, released statements affirming their disavowal of white supremacist groups and neo-Nazis — but not explicitly condemning Trump, who said Tuesday there were "very fine people" protesting in Charlottesville amid the torch-bearing marchers.
Within the White House, Trump's aides privately expressed indignation at the derailed news conference, which unraveled on cable television Tuesday afternoon and has been replayed endlessly since.
But they, too, stopped short of declaring their consternation publicly, determined instead to remain focused on their agenda and keep the President occupied.
Trump himself has remained largely silent on the matter. But inside the glassed-in confines of Trump Tower — where he remained inside for nearly two days straight — the President was defiant in the wake of the ensuing backlash, according to two people who visited the building on Wednesday.
He's plunging forward "without regret," one of those people said, firmly believing the media and East Coast elites are unfairly hyperventilating about the Charlottesville remarks. The two people said it is similar to the posture he took during challenging moments of his winning presidential campaign.
Some Trump aides described themselves as shocked at the President's remarks. But the more common sentiment Wednesday was dismay — at Trump's words, but also at his repeated inability to remain on the intended message.
For many of the operatives and policy experts who signed on to work for the Republican President, it was a familiar feeling. There have been stumbles and setbacks throughout Trump's presidency that prompted head-shaking and grumbles from even the most unwavering aides.
The shadows this week are darker, the advisers concede, with a greater chance of obscuring whatever message the President hopes to advance as he returns to Washington from his working vacation next week.
No signs of departures from Trump world
But despite those anxieties, there have been no signs of defections from Trump's inner circle. As of Wednesday afternoon, no members of Trump's administration — including high-profile Jewish advisers Gary Cohn and Jared Kushner — announced they were resigning. Instead, officials described a heads-down attitude among Trump's staff, despite the growing controversy.
White House chief of staff John Kelly — who watched grimly as Trump held forth in the lobby of Trump Tower — was frustrated at how Trump's appearance played out, including the President's unplanned decision to take questions, a person familiar with the matter said Tuesday.
But a day later, Kelly has urged staffers to remain focused on their work rather than stew in recriminations about the press conference gone wrong, one official said.
"We have work to do and we're going to do it," said one administration official when asked about the mood inside the White House.
The two people who visited Trump Tower on Wednesday, speaking about an internal debate on condition of anonymity, said the reaction to Trump's remarks is so far breaking along similar lines that previous arguments inside Trump's orbit have fallen.
The President's sons and those directly around him believe he is in the right and saying out loud what many of his supporters believe. Yet his newer advisers are troubled by the reaction and frustrated that Trump doesn't seem to recognize the damage his remarks pose to his political agenda.
Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, are vacationing in Vermont, but have communicated with the President. They have not responded to CNN requests for comment. First Lady Melania Trump was at Trump's golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, during the press conference and remains there.
Cohn was "enraged" at having to stand at the President's side during his statement, an associate of his told CNN. By Wednesday, however, his anger gave way to being "disappointed" and "embarrassed" in the wake of the brutal news coverage. This friend said he wouldn't be surprised if Cohn quit, but doesn't believe he has made a decision and could also very well stay.
Marc Short, the White House legislative affairs director, was on Capitol Hill Wednesday afternoon on a previously scheduled visit, talking about Trump's agenda and the plan for September.
And Stephen Miller , Trump's policy adviser and speech-writer, hosted a mid-morning conference call with conservative operatives and some Capitol Hill aides to discuss Trump's upcoming legislative agenda, a person familiar with the matter said. Miller warned those who joined the call not to stray from his intended topics, which didn't include the President's remarks about Charlottesville.
Trying to move on
Attempting forward momentum, the White House announced Trump would travel Friday to Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains, to meet with members of his national security team to discuss strategy in Afghanistan.
Vice President Mike Pence, traveling in South America, said he was cutting his trip short to join Trump at Camp David. But he, too, offered only support for the President.
"The President has been clear on this tragedy and so have I," Pence said during an appearance alongside Chile's president. "I spoke at length about this heartbreaking situation on Sunday night in Colombia and I stand with the President and I stand by those words."
On Wednesday morning, however, there were virtually no voices backing Trump on morning television, despite a document circulated by the White House on Tuesday evening providing talking points to regular surrogates for the President.
"Everything will be harder now," a senior White House official said, but dismissed the flood of apocalyptic suggestions from observers of both parties.
In Congress, most Republican lawmakers appeared cautious in their approach to Trump's remarks. While virtually none came out in support of his statements, few called him out by name, either.
Those who did were regular critics of Trump's tactics.
"Mr. President, I encourage you to try to bring us together as a nation after this horrific event in Charlottesville. Your words are dividing Americans, not healing them," said Sen. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who ran against Trump for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016.
After a high-profile failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act , congressional Republicans and the White House are under pressure to deliver on promises to reform the US tax system and advance an infrastructure package — items that will require some element of cooperation between the White House and Capitol Hill.
More pressing is next month's deadline to raise the nation's debt ceiling, which will require Republican congressional leaders to both wrangle their own members — some of whom want to pair the increase with spending reforms — and to reach an agreement with Trump.
Failure to strike a deal would cause the nation to default on its debts, roiling financial markets and causing catastrophic effects on the economy — a potential outcome that has some lawmakers, including McConnell, wary of overly harsh treatment of Trump.
McConnell was privately upset with the President's handling of the episode , according to a source close to the Republican leader. The source said McConnell was deeply concerned that Trump is reopening long-festering racial tensions, something that could fan the flames ahead of demonstrations expected this month in Lexington, Kentucky.
McConnell -- who released a statement Wednesday that declared "there are no good neo-Nazis" but stopped short of criticizing Trump by name -- is taking a cautious approach after Trump lashed the GOP leader repeatedly last week, according to the source.
McConnell, the source said, did not want to immediately attack Trump for fear that it would look like retribution for their fight last week.
The Socceroos could be hounded by violent local fans from the second they touch down in Honduras after local papers published sensitive details about their trip.
Honduran publications revealed the main airport arrival times for the Australian team, along with the name of their hotel and time of their training sessions.
Supporters travelling to Honduras, the former murder capital of the world, are also on high alert after the details of their accommodation were published.

Australia's Socceroos will take on Honduras in two-legged World Cup playoff tie
Socceroos officials are said to be concerned that the leak of information could encourage rowdy fans to interfere with their limited preparation.
Australia will need to travel outside of Honduras' capital city for their first away game, competing in a stadium feared by players for its hostile environment.
Estádio Olímpico Metropolitano, located in Pedro San Sula, is a raucous stadium that will be packed with close to 40,000 fans cheering on their home side.
The old school stadium, which has a running track just one metre outside of the pitch, uses a barbed wire fence and small moat to separate fans from players.
Crowd hostility will be nothing like Australia has experienced in Asia over its 20 qualifiers in this World Cup cycle.
In 2016, Honduras were fined $50,000 by FIFA and given a one match-ban from their notorious national stadium for 'homophobic chants' by rowdy fans.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has warned Australians to exercise a 'high level of caution' if travelling to Honduras
Australia's logistically complex and final World Cup qualifying mission is officially underway, as a squad of close to 50 make their way across the South Pacific Ocean.
Ange Postecoglou's squad have completed club duties in 15 countries across the weekend, and are heading for Central America for Friday's (Saturday AEDT) away leg in the intercontinental playoff.
Collectively, the Socceroos will travel around 200,000 kilometres from their club homes to Honduras.
The longest route is from Melbourne to San Pedro Sula, already undertaken by Postecoglou and James Troisi on Sunday and Tim Cahill on Monday.
Cahill's travel was delayed by a day to aid his recovery from a rolled ankle while on club duty with Melbourne City.
The shortest - by Mitch Langerak, based with Levante in the Spanish city of Valencia - still took the best part of a day's travel.
Australia now faces a similar task, making the tiring journey to Honduras (fans pictured) to play in front of a raucous Central American crowd
Honduras (national soccer team pictured) sealed fourth spot in their group and a Socceroos playoff via their 3-2 upset of group winners Mexico
But the Socceroos are used to it.
Their journey to the World Cup has already taken in 20 games, with away days in Saudi Arabia, Iran, the UAE, Jordan, Tajikistan, Bangladesh, Kyrgyzstan, Thailand, Malaysia and Japan.
No country will have had to face a longer or more arduous route to Russia.
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has warned Australians to exercise a 'high level of caution' if travelling to Honduras.
'Exercise a high degree of caution in Honduras because of the high levels of violent crime. Be alert and pay close attention to your personal security at all times,' the department warns.
'Violent crime, including murder, robbery, burglary, kidnapping, carjacking and sexual assault, is widespread in Honduras, often involving firearms.'
'The Socceroos match will likely draw a large crowd which may become unruly. Exercise cautions around large gatherings, including those associated with the Socceroos match.'
Australia will likely play in Estádio Olímpico Metropolitano (pictured), a notorious stadium that needs a barbed wire fence and small moat to separate roughly 40,000 fans from players
On average, 20 people are killed every day in Honduras, partly in thanks to escalating gang tensions in the Central American country's north (riot police fend off supporters of former Honduran President Manuel Zelaya when he was ousted in 2009)
In 2016, Honduras were fined $50,000 by FIFA and given a one match-ban from their national stadium (pictured) for 'homophobic chants' by rowdy fans
Honduras, which has one of the highest homicide rates in the world, famously went to war against El Salvador in 1969 after losing a soccer match.
Dubbed 'The Football War', the conflict last just four days but resulted in the deaths of over 3,000 people and the displacement of hundreds of thousands more.
It took Honduras and El Salvador 11 years to reconcile and sign a peace treaty, and decades to rebuild their damaged economies.
Pedro San Sula was known as 'murder capital of the world' until early 2016, when Venezuela's capital Caracas eclipsed its sky-high homicide rate.
Every day in Honduras roughly 20 people are killed, according to the latest figures, partly in thanks to escalating gang tensions in the country's north.
The Socceroos will make the perilous journey without key players Mark Milligan and Mathew Leckie, both suspended for the first leg after picking up their second yellow cards of the Syria matches.
Postecoglou, set to walk from the job after the cut-throat tie, hoped to receive as much financial support as possible for the series, to be played between November 6 and 14 and culminating in a home leg at Sydney's ANZ Stadium.
Ed Timperlake points out to me that in an underage sex investigation, all electronic communications of the investigative target are pursued. This probably led to the grand jury that was announced 11 days ago issuing a subpoena for all of the devices in the possession of Weiner and his family, including Huma. As Lucianne Goldberg quipped, they even seize the Speak & Spell toys in these cases. This grand jury is in New York, possibly less poltiically supervised than the first Hillary email investigation.
The criminal investigation underway over Anthony Weiner's alleged child sex infraction has a couple of characteristics that make it especially awkward for Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin, the estranged wife of Weiner and close companion of Hillary.
Evidently, some of these devices were not turned over in the first investigation and contained “pertinent” emails. We do not know with certainty, but some reports indicate the pertinent emails may have been found on Weiner's laptop. Recall that the initial investigation did not convene a grand jury and did not therefore have subpoena power. It is possible that Huma Abedin misled the FBI over the existence of pertinent emails on her then-husband's computing devices.
So what could have been on the laptop Carlos Danger used for sexting?
Adam Yoshida, with a background in information technology consulting for affluent and powerful people emails:
…Clinton [was] using e-mails seemingly like most people use IMs or text messaging. Her holding onto Blackberries (and seven switching back to older models when the software was upgraded) [demonstrates this]. It might even explain at least SOME of the motivation for the e-mail server itself. I've seen plenty of cases where a powerful person says basically, “I want my e-mails on this thing” and, regardless of whether it's a good solution, people respond, “ready-aye-ready.” So, what could they have found on Weiner's computers that would have caused such alarm? I'd think one of two things: 1) Either that Huma signed in her e-mail account at one point and, presumably, it being Exchange or IMAP, dumped the whole account onto the computer and that account has plenty of e-mails between her and Clinton that were deleted. Or - 2) There's mention of Huma having a Yahoo account to which she would forward things for printing purposes. This struck me right away because, of course, printers are often difficult to configure as are e-mail accounts. It struck me as strange, yet very believable, that she mentioned that she'd forward stuff to that Yahoo account to print them. I mean, printing in theory should be platform agnostic, but - if you're technically unsophisticated - you might have serious problems trying to setup an e-mail account or a printer on a device. Thus I imagine a scenario where she has a portable machine that either she can't (or can't be, for some reason) configured to use her home printer and a desktop machine (I imagine an slightly-older iMac here) that's physically connected to the printer that serves as a shared “family computer” or whatever. She either can't setup the e-mail account on that computer (perhaps it requires a VPN or something like that) or doesn't want to, so she forwards everything that she wants to print to the Yahoo account that she does have setup on that computer. The FBI takes this computer as part of the Weiner investigation and, bam, they find thousands of e-mail messages - again, evidence of what was destroyed earlier.
Now, consider for a moment Anthony Weiner's future. His wife dumped him, and he is of no use to the Clintons anymore. Penalties for online sex crimes tend to be severe, and child sex offenders are reported to do extremely unpleasant time in prison. Ed Timperlake thinks:
It has been said and also demonstrated by his actions that Anthony Weiner is a real self-centered narcissist. If he remains true to his character, there is a possibility that he will consider cutting a deal for a lesser sentence in return for evidence and testimony against Clinton Inc. I bet he knows a lot.
Aside from his genitals, I don't think Weiner has a reputation as a stand-up guy.
The New York Times announced today that it's reducing the number of articles you can read for free before you hit its paywall.
You used to be able to read 20 free articles a month, but beginning in April you will only be able to download 10.
If you would like to keep enjoying the Times' reporting then it may be time to pay up and finally purchase a subscription.
The other option is to remain defiant and get creative about how you can still access quality reporting on important news happening around the world at a great price: free.
The last time this happened, computer whiz 's offered up some awesome hacks and extensions to get around the paywall. Then the Times came up with new hacks to counter them and many users were shut out again. Now it's harder than ever to break the Times' rules.
We put together a few tips that will still help you beat the paywall.
While one may wonder about the implications of the just announced "accelerated windown" of the GSEs, predicated in no small part by the surge in animosity between Tim Geithner and the FHFA's Ed DeMarco, there is one aspect of the announcement that is completely and utterly unambigious: as part of its justification to demand faster liquidation of Fannie and Freddie's "investment portfolio" Tim Geithner gave the following argument:
This will help achieve several important objectives, including... Ending the circular practice of the Treasury advancing funds to the GSEs simply to pay dividends back to Treasury
In other words not some fringe blog, not some "partisan" media outlet, not some morally conflicted whistleblowing former employee seeking immunity, but the US Trasury itself just admitted it had been engaged in circular check kiting scheme, which essentially has all the components of a Ponzi scheme in it, ever since the nationalization (about which there is no now doubt and which means the GSE's $6 trillion in debt is now fully on the Treasury's balance sheet) of Fannie and Freddie in 2008.
Transfer one more conspiracy theory into the conspiracy fact bin.
Microsoft may have made a big push to settle many of the antitrust actions facing it around the globe, but those efforts have run up against a major stumbling block: the company's inability to document the protocols need to interoperate with its own software. Documentation problems got Microsoft in hot water with the EU, and they're now the only reason it continues to be under court supervision in the aftermath of its antitrust settlement. But, despite having interoperability become a corporate strategy, its documentation efforts came under fire in a court hearing earlier today.
In the wake of antitrust actions, documentation of Microsoft technologies has become a method of allaying the concerns of legal authorities in both the US and EU. By providing documentation of the APIs and protocols used by its products, Microsoft would not only allow third-party and open-source software to interact better with Windows and other software, but potentially enable them to write replacements, in whole or in part, for Microsoft products. This, in theory, would enable more software companies to compete on equal terms with Redmond.
Unfortunately, the company has consistently had trouble with producing complete and useful documentation. As noted above, the company struggled to satisfy EU authorities that it was complying with the agreement—that was 2006. By 2008, documentation was rearing its ugly head in the US court system. Microsoft's consent decree with the federal and state attorneys general was set to expire, and most of the conditions were allowed to. But Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who is overseeing the consent decree, ruled that Microsoft still hadn't sufficiently documented some protocols, despite those documents having been due in 2003. As a result, the consent decree will remain in place at least until November of 2009.
Today saw Kollar-Kotelly hold the latest hearing on the status of the consent agreements, and a number of reports suggest that there still seem to be problems there (no legal documents arising from the hearing have been filed yet). Although the Dow Jones Newswire seems to think everything is fine, other reports seem to contradict this. Reuters, however, indicates that the Judge was a bit annoyed that Microsoft filed a document that suggested it viewed itself as being in full compliance with the agreement, given that the documentation wasn't ready. Referring to the 2009 date for the lifting of the consent agreement, she said, "That's not going to happen unless these things get done."
Meanwhile, CNet has quotes from the New York's Attorney General's office that suggest they are getting antsy. After complaining that Microsoft appears to act as if it's doing everyone a favor by complying with its legal obligations, Jay Hines is quoted as saying, "What we have today is the [technical committee] and its staff spoon-feeding the world's biggest PC company. Something about that just isn't right."
Given that this is the last sword hanging over its metaphorical head in the US, it's not clear why Microsoft isn't bending over backwards to make it go away. Most developers find Microsoft's API documentation to be pretty good, so it's clear that the company can produce similar documents when it is determined to.
More than half of the children interviewed in three countries, Ivory Coast, South Sudan and Haiti, knew of cases of forced sex with aid staff or peacekeepers.
The assaults were often in return for the very food or protection supposed to be provided to the vulnerable in a crisis.
Similar allegations have dogged UN missions since the organisation sent peacekeepers to Cambodia in the 1990s. However, today's report, from Save The Children, is the first to point the finger at civilian aid staff, including those working for British charities, as well as soldiers.
Its findings suggest a continuing lack of action despite promises to tackle alleged abuse made at a conference of UN officials and aid agencies in December 2006.
Six months after that meeting's stern commitments, 12-year-old "Elizabeth" claimed that she was walking to tend her mother's fields past the camp of a battalion of UN peacekeepers in northwestern Ivory Coast.
"There were men there who called my little brother over and gave him biscuits," she haltingly told The Daily Telegraph last week in a village close to the town of Man.
"I refused to go, but one man came to me and held me by my dress and took me into the bush far from the road. His friends came, there were 10 of them. They held me down and raped me one by one. I could not flee. They were big men.
Afterwards I ran to my village, I was crying all night and vomiting. Even today I have medical problems. I can never forget that thing, it is stuck in my mind and I keep seeing it happen over and over like a film."
Too fearful to leave the security of her village, she has dropped out of school. Even now, almost a year later, she says she freezes with fear whenever she sees a white UN or aid agency vehicle.
Elizabeth's case is not unique among the 341 children interviewed.
A third claimed that they knew of someone in their community who had been sexually attacked by a peacekeeper or an aid worker.
More than half claimed to know of cases where penniless children, some as young as six, were forced into sexual acts in return for money or food.
The overwhelming majority of those interviewed said that they would not report a case of abuse themselves and had never heard of others doing so, despite commitments from all humanitarian agencies that allegations would be dealt with sensitively but firmly.
Heather Kerr, Save The Children's country director in the Ivory Coast, said: "Even one prosecution would show that local authorities will act, and that would be a big step forward."
A spokesman for the UN's Department of Peacekeeping Operations in New York said: "The abuse of children by those who are sent to help is a significant and painful issue and one that we have begun to address. We are doing everything we can to train and monitor our civilian staff."
Save The Children itself is not immune. There were 15 allegations of misconduct towards children made against its staff in 2007, three of which were proven and led to dismissal. Oxfam reported 12 allegations of exploitation or abuse in 2007, leading to three staff members being sacked.
They and other British-based agencies including Plan International, ActionAid and Care said that they supported the Save The Children report's call for a global watchdog to police sex abuse by aid staff.
Cardinals Pro Bowl defensive end Calais Campbell recently asserted on NFL Total Access that Frank Gore was the biggest loss among the mass exodus of 49ers stars this past offseason.
"He was the heart and soul of that offense -- and really that team," Campbell explained. "... Playing against him, he is the guy. He's really the one we had to stop."
Now that Gore is 32 years old and playing outside the comfortable confines of San Francisco for the first time in his 11-year career, can the Colts expect their new backfield savior to keep stiff-arming Father Time?
The answer is a resounding yes, for several reasons.
Still the 'Inconvenient Truth'?
Will Gore's NFL swan song play out like Corey Dillon in New England (1,635 rushing yards, 12 touchdowns) and Stephen Davis in Carolina (1,444 rushing yards, 8 touchdowns) or more closely resemble the late-career flops of Steven Jackson in Atlanta (543 rushing yards, 6 touchdowns) and Emmitt Smith in Arizona (256 rushing yards, 2 touchdowns)?
If his 2014 season had ended in Week 15, we might assume the latter.
Gore was coming off the least effective stretch of his career, failing to top the 100-yard mark in nine consecutive games while averaging a scant 3.46 yards per carry over that span. The five-time Pro Bowler was being phased out of game plans with the offensive line severely backsliding from its 2012-2013 dominance.
Once rookie Carlos Hyde came down with a late-season ankle sprain, though, the 49ers saddled up their workhorse for the final two games of the season.
What followed was one of the most impressive two-game stretches of Gore's career. He responded with 302 yards on 61 carries, marking the first time he had rushed for at least 140 yards in back-to-back games since November of 2006.
Although Gore may be the NFL's slowest starting running back at this stage of his career -- he finished near the bottom in Pro Football Focus' Elusive Rating and Breakaway Percentage metrics -- he remains effective via uncanny patience, vision and toughness.
Gore has actually averaged more rushing yards per season (1,165) since age 28 than he did in his first six years (1,069) in the league.
His 158-yard performance versus the Chargers in a 38-35 Week 16 loss was one of the most impressive all-around games by any tailback in 2014.
What does he offer the Colts after two years of watching Trent Richardson run up the back of his offensive linemen?
"Sustainability. He's a chain mover," NFL Films Senior Producer Greg Cosell recently explained. "I don't think there's been a back in the last five, six, seven years who have been able to get through small cracks at the point of attack better than Frank Gore. Frank Gore is your classic four-, five-, six-yard runner.
"He's probably past the point where he's going to break a 40-yarder. That wasn't really his game anyway. ... He would get so skinny going through the point of attack and come out the other end, I'd have to watch the play four or five times on film and try to figure out how did he get through there. And that's what he gives this offense. He gives them a sustaining element, so they'll be in more favorable down-and-distance situations."
Pep Hamilton's scheme
Gore didn't land in Indianapolis simply because of his University of Miami connections to coach Chuck Pagano, associate head coach Rob Chudzinski and star wideout Andre Johnson.
The big draw, Gore told NFL Media analyst LaDainian Tomlinson, was the presence of offensive coordinator Pep Hamilton, who learned under Jim Harbaugh at Stanford.
Ever since the ill-fated Richardson move in September of 2013, Hamilton has been crafting a power-running scheme featuring inside runs designed to soften the interior of opposing defenses.
It's the same scheme under which Gore thrived for the past half-decade in one of the NFL's most consistently successful power attacks.
Entering his twilight years, Gore wouldn't succeed in just any offense. Fortunately, Hamilton's is the one best suited to emphasize his unparalleled patience and vision.
Lighter boxes
"If you want to try and stop him and slow him down," Pagano said in early June, "I'd recommend you being in an eight-man spacing."
Pagano was referring to loading eight defenders in the box -- a tactic defensive coaches habitually used versus the 49ers.
According to Football Outsiders, Gore faced eight- or nine-man fronts on a league-high 30 percent of his carries last season, compared to the league average of 14.4 percent. In fact, Gore has had the highest percentage of carries against eight- or nine-man fronts for three consecutive seasons.
He can rest assured that won't be a problem with Andrew Luck's coach-like powers of perception and unique arm talent directing the Colts' offense.
Going back to college, as NFL Media analyst Bucky Brooks explained in an informative 2013 feature, Luck pummeled opponents with a power running game that featured "check with me" calls based on defensive alignment.
If the presence of Gore leads to more loaded boxes, Luck will pick secondaries apart with high-percentage opportunities on the outside in early downs.
"One of the most improved players is going to be Gore," one NFL scout recently offered, via Bleacher Report's Mike Freeman. "He'll look like he's 22 years old in that offense. It's so wide-open, and Gore will have lots of room to run."
Worried about the Colts' much-beleaguered offensive line? Don't be.
As is often the case, a poor pass-protection unit is perfectly adequate in paving lanes for the ground game.
Indianapolis running backs not named "Richardson" have averaged 4.7 yards on 350 carries over the past two years.

'Greatest 'Shoe on Earth'
Prior to Ahmad Bradshaw's season-ending injury and Reggie Wayne's late-season collapse, Luck was on pace to break Peyton Manning's single-season record for passing yards while orchestrating the NFL's top-scoring offense.
The Colts have since replaced Bradshaw and Wayne with two of the greatest players of their generation in Gore and and the "still-dominant" Johnson.
When speedy playmaker Phillip Dorsett was drafted in the first round to go with raw but talented second-year breakout candidate Donte Moncrief, Hamilton quipped that his loaded offense would now be the "Greatest 'Shoe on Earth" -- in a nod to the Rams' "Greatest Show on Turf" moniker.
Luck can now direct a true pick-your-poison attack, softening boxes with Gore, exploiting mismatches underneath with Johnson, Dwayne Allen and Coby Fleener and connecting on shot plays outside the numbers and down the field with Dorsett, Moncrief and T.Y. Hilton.
This is nightmare fuel for opposing defensive coordinators.

The Problem / History Lesson
ZSNES is one of the most popular SNES emulators, and is heralded as the best. It will ways be remembered by us oldschoolers.
The Netplay feature allows online friends to play SNES games with each other. ZSnes does not have the most reliable netplay I'm told, and it has its limitations. I've even been told to check out RetroArch, but I like being in ZSNES over other emulators. I wanted to feel like I was 5 years old again. ZSNES needs updating. It may be time to move but I haven't yet. In fact, I'm attracted to it. But anyways, back to the problem at hand.
The problem stems from a couple events.
1) The netplay feature was removed at ZSNES version 1.43.
2) ZSNES was never out for Intel Mac until version 1.43
During this time (Nov/Dec '14), while the rest of the country bitched about politics, ebola, and racism, I went to work on an Intel Mac ZSNES port supporting netplay.
The Solution I ported & compiled my own Macintosh version of ZSnes 1.42 and 1.36!! And I succeeded last night after ~11 hours of brute strength! I did both versions because they are the traditional best for zsnes netplay, 1.36 being the most stable. In all actuality, I only worked on this port so far from Dec 2 - 5. It took me one 12-hour session to port both 1.36 and 1.42 to OSX with keyboard input being sloppy. On the third day, I debugged and discovered the issue was that the Mac has a different scancode map. I wrote a LUT and had everything working flawlessly, including this doc page by day 3. :) Here are some problems I recall running into: Stack misalignment, nasm compile with -f macho and no -DELF
Why isn't this already available?
What can YOU do with my ZSnes port?
Issues
Only 2 machines may connect (up to 4? players)
Using the Mac as server can sometimes cause freeze at game load, for unknown reasons
Tried fixing by ensuring both comps on same screen res, restarting both computers, don't know the problem. Fixed by using the Windows 8.1 computer as server instead
Setting the screen resolution to full screen causes freeze at gameload when MAC is server. This was the case against Windows 8.1 client zsnes 1.36
ZSNES is strongly written in IA32 assembly language. I decided WAY too out-of-my-league to port the IA-32 assembly to x86_64 assembly.. That should be an obvious undertaking that nobody would be excited about.. But if that kind of thing gets you excited, hit me up, you can port it for us all! I am personally not concerned at all running in 32-bit mode.
The stack misalignment issue -- on Macs, the stack must be 16-byte aligned when certain calls are made. I do not know enough about it to diagnose the problem accurately. But I was able to patch ZSNES enough so that it bitches a little about stack misalignment. gcc flag -mstackrealign maybe helped. I also had to insert some extreme assembly to manually fix the stack at certain areas which I cannot recall but are probably in my log file ChangesBazz.txt.. Anyways, zsnes does not crash and appears to operate perfectly.
Don't try compiling SDL 1.2.14 (not that it would help), lots of problems with that on newer Mac ie Mavericks
The scancode issue may have stemmed from compiling with X support.. not sure.. fixed anyways.. could be problematic in the future who knows
Status
Video - Perfect as per version. Limited resolutions as I compiled without OpenGL. Max res with openGL on 1.36 is 1024x768. It's 16-bit age fuck widescreen.
Sound - Perfect as per version. During netplay, sound can speed up or slow down randomly, for long or short periods of time. This depends on if you have other apps running on the computer and maybe also network latency. Try killing all other apps before playing online. Otherwise it can get really annoying. I was screen recording and it was doing this, I had to stop.
Input - Great
keyboard - I can only test my 2009 MacBookPro keyboard keys, but it's perfect so far ;).. No current support for numpad or other keys I cannot test (pageup/down etc)
Joypad - flawless
Cross-Platform Support Tested
Windows 8.1 OSX 10.9.5 Y
What Other Solutions are Available now? (OR.. not?)
RetroArch RetroArch is considered something of a Super-frontend (with netplay). It works with emus that have been ported to compile as a "core" module for RetroArch. For SNES, this includes BSNES and Snes9X. I'm not aware of any others. On the LibRetro Downloads page, you can download both RetroArch and the SNES emu cores for OSX. Hint, I had a lot of trouble getting started, so I will provide some advice.
Use 'X' to enter a menu item and 'Z' to go back. 'F' will toggle fullscreen
Settings -> Path Options -> Content Directory is actually the ROM Directory ;)
The config file can be manually edited at ~/Library/Application Support/RetroArch
At bootup, even after you specify the correct core dir, it will always bitch that it found no cores.. :[
The public pre-compiled Snes9X Cores would crash at load-time for me, I could only get BSNES cores to work
Snes9X 1.53 (Mac)
This has netplay, but it's TCP-only and is heralded as the worst SNES netplay around. I'm a fan of using proven reliable programs like ZSnes, but this can be given a shot. You would have to make sure both ppl use the same version of Snes9x. Server must have port forwarded 6096 TCP. Client might be able to get away without strict port forwarding rules.

They will do netplay support some day
They will do netplay support some day ZNet
"Z-Net I is a program (Windows) that acts as a central hub and launch pad for people wanting to play the Super Nintendo emulator ZSNES online with friends or strangers." It has replaced the older ZBattle.net you may have used in the past, like I did. But ZNet 3 will be coming out with greater support and hopes to be cross platform some day (being written in QT). I anticipate that my work may intersect with it to provide Mac ZSNES over ZNet. IIRC, ZNet does not provide source code.

Also Windows only!! No source code!!
Possible Scenarios
My girlfriend uses Windows and I use Mac, and we want to play SNES games online with each other
I have Windows on my Mac and could get the job done by booting into that, but I like staying in OSX (That's me lol). I don't want the degraded performance of a virtualized Windows OS either!
We both have Macs we want to play SNES games remotely
That's what I said!! The netplay feature of ZSnes was removed in 1.43, and that was the first version ported to Intel Macs. Speculation suggests the developers figured the netplay feature was trash. But that wasn't true, I myself had plenty of fun with it, definitely more than NOT having it at all!! They should have left it in there.. But they did not, so net play is only present on v1.42 and 1.36. For the course of what felt like 10 years, nobody bothered filling in the gap, and a Google search proved to me that no other emulators provided this feature -- except for SNES9X -- the problem is that the SNES9X netplay is TCP only and people say it sucks when branching beyond the LAN.. I myself haven't tried it. CBAYou can netplay SNES games from your Mac with other users, even users on different OS (Linux, Windows). This is bloody cutting edge, so it's experimental. Give it a shot! As with all of the ZSnes on netplay, you still need to make sure your partner has the same version of ZSNes as you. and BOTH players need the specified port (default 7845) forwarded, not just the server. Again, that's the way for all ZSNES online experiences.I will add and update as we go along..When I netplay, I have trouble being the Mac as a server (crashes), so try to be the client if you are on a Mac. I have not tried netplaying 2 macs, please post your results to me. Email Me This should be obvious.. But hey, why not, I'll use myself as an example.
Those are not ALL the scenarios lol of course not! For years, nobody could really enjoy it. Snes9x is there but I hear its netplay is terrible. I didn't give it a chance. I used to play Secret of Mana with a remote friend online with ZBattle.net and so I know I enjoyed the reliability of ZSnes netplay. LOL, but I should have tried snes9x now that I think about it.... OOPS...
Giving SNES9X a Chance
Well, I just tried it successfully over LAN loopback over public IP. I found the flaw of SNES9X -- It only uses TCP. I found out by checking the source code to snes9x 1.53 (Mac OSX version) and searched it all for sock_dgram to no avail, only sock_stream yielded results. So this must be the reason why net play beyond the LAN is poorly reviewed on Snes9x -- TCP only. So while I didn't actually try a game with a remote friend, seeing TCP-only was enough for me -- I have a lot of experience using these protocols. I know that UDP is the better option.
Download
THESE ARE RAW BINARIES. Run them from the terminal. This is zsnes 1.36 and zsnes 1.42, statically back-compiled to OSX 10.5, but not tested on anything other than my Mavericks development machine. Please make yourself available to tell me your great experience.
ZSnes 1.36.001 (stable)
ZSnes 1.42.001
Update: 1.36 .app package available here
Terminal How-To
OK, since I'm not experienced at compiling "Universal" binaries it might not run at all.. but give it a shot. This is how to do it..
You can download a program called iTerm or use the built-in terminal which is located in the /Applications/Utilities folder on your Mac... once inside the terminal, you must navigate to the folder where the binary is located.. ie: cd ~/Downloads the cd command changes directory.. Once you're inside the proper directory, type "./" then the name of the file, no spaces.. It should run hopefully..
Source Code
My zsnes 1.36 project source code is available on My GitHub. My initial commit is in "pre-configured" state. just try a make in src dir. More to come
Where to Go from Here
I need you to test this with people and report to me your results. I will want to hear about your OS, zsnes version, and your friend's as well. Let me know what happened, good or bad. Any other problems hit me up. mbazzinotti AT gmail.com
The distribution I have made is pure cmd-line binary. The next step would be to make it a more conventional Mac "app" -- This can be learned best from the other ported versions of Zsnes, ie. from HectorChu's 1.43 port or Xenoveritas' 1.51 port. This is because they already have the code that allows file drops of the SNES ROM types. My one concern is my code is built from the Unix makefile, not imported into XCode, which might have to be done to produce the .app package.
Bangladesh's local fashion brands live on sales ahead of festivals, especially the Eid-ul-Fitr, as the lion's share of their annual profits come from seasonal sales. These seasonal sales are responsible for most of the profit, with the Eid-ul-Fitr alone contributing to about 40% of the profits of leading brands, according to Fashion Entrepreneurs Association of Bangladesh (FEAB). Other festivities like Pohela Boishakh, Pohela Falgun, Ekushey February, Independence Day and Victory Day. However, it is different for less prominent brands which make up to 80%-90% of their annual profits from the Eid sales. “Throughout the year, we register good sales and it picks up during the festival,” Rezaul Karim, Anjon's Mirpur branch in-charge, told the Dhaka Tribune. “Of the total profits, about 40% come from Eid sales, about 10% from Pohela Boishakh and the rest from other festivals since we have sales on more or less every occasion,” said Rezaul. After Eid, sales plummet and it becomes very difficult to reach sales targets. “Profits from the festival sales are higher than normal sales. It is common that a brand sells products at twice the price,” a sales executive from a renowned shop at Bashundhara City told the Dhaka Tribune. Since people receive Eid bonus from their employers, they are able to spend more money. More money equate to more disposable income, hence brands find an opportunity to overcharge products. While established brands thrive on seasonal exploitation, less renowned brands find it difficult to break even, much less make a profit. [caption id="attachment_71254" align="aligncenter" width="900"] FEAB data says the annual turnover of the fashionwear sector is about Tk6,000cr and there are at least 4,500 fashion houses in the country. The photo was taken recently at Bashundhara Shopping Mall in Dhaka[/caption] Md Anisur Rahman, Mirpur branch manager of Grameen Mela, said: “Our sales throughout the year run the business from hand to mouth. Festival sales like Eid-ul-Fitr are the only way we can imagine making a profit.” About 90% of the annual profits come from Ramadan sales. But imports from India, China and Pakistan have cast shadow on businesses recently, said Liton Das, in-charge of Meghla Fashion's Mirpur Branch. Fashion brands usually design products with their own resource and designers. But there are others who outsource or base their designs on others. “Years back, foreign fashion brands dominated to domesticate market and the lion's share of the demands were met by imported goods,” Shameem Ahmad, vice president of FEAB told the Dhaka Tribune. But over the past several years, domestic fashion brands have generated sufficient buzz to meet the greater share of the clothing demands. Even then, the Eid sales remain the main source of profits, said Shameem. He also says that domestic fashion brands have become increasingly competitive, improving their products and thereby attracting more buyers. FEAB data says the annual turnover of the fashionwear sector is about Tk6,000cr. There are at least 4,500 fashion houses in the country, employing nearly five million people, 70% of whom are women. According to Bangladesh Dokan Malik Samity, the Eid-ul-Fitr sales value of all products is about Tk20,000cr. As the number of middle income groups increase in the country, and newer generations find themselves sensationalised by the unique marketing of local brands, domestic sales will continue to increase. The middle income groups and the younger generations are the main client base of domestic fashion brands. “A person's fashion sense will dictate what they will buy for Eid,” Natasha Khondakar, a private service holder told the Dhaka Tribune. “I myself prefer local brands because they are not only unique but also of really good quality. They are stylish, dependable and made in Bangladesh,” Natasha said. “Since Eid is the biggest festival, I have to buy 15-20 dresses for my relatives. Compared to other festivals, I spend a lot more during Eid,” said Shamsun Nahar, a homemaker told the Dhaka Tribune.
“If you own something, you will fight to protect it. If not, someone will come along and take it”.
The above statement holds true, whether you are talking about your own personal property, your family's property, or your country's resources and assets. The scale doesn't matter – the principle remains the same.
Unless you've been living under a rock, you will have noticed that the economies of our formerly White ‘Nations' (for want of a better word) are not what they used to be. Manufacturing and Agriculture have steadily declined since the 1970's, and now we've reached the point where we hardly do either of these things at all. When a country no longer does any productive work, it tends to struggle to convince the rest of the world that its currency is worth anything. But don't despair, for it is easy to identify the forces at work systematically gutting Western economies – namely the World Trade Organisation with its ‘Free Trade Agreements', the U.N with its I.P.C.C. Global Warming hoax, the International Monetary Fund & World Bank which works extremely closely with the WTO, and then finally the international force which created the U.N/WTO/World Bank/IMF power structure – The Jew! Let us never forget that it is the Jew who drives this push for world domination!
In the real world you'll find that economies are not anywhere near as complicated as the TV (electric Jew) pretends. The animal world lives and deals with its own economic systems, but the key point is that their economic systems, whilst simple, are in tune with and deal only with natural, real quantities. The real purpose of money is to facilitate an easier and more efficient exchange of goods, as opposed to bartering, which would be very tiresome! There is no other legitimate purpose or use for money, none! Where did humans go wrong? The answer is that we are living under the unnatural, parasitic rule of a ‘financial system' which is at odds with every naturally developed real economy. If ‘finance' is not in tune with the same principles which uphold economic reality, then eventual failure is the only possible outcome.
This is why we are in the mess that we are in:
Free Trade Agreements
Free Trade translates in simple terms to ‘no National borders'. When you have no National borders, you have no protection, no way of guarding anything from International Communist thieves. Immediately there is a huge problem. What usually happens to unguarded assets? Answer – they disappear! This is precisely what has happened, and continues to happen in the Western world. National Economic Protectionism was the only way of stopping this from happening, but slowly the ‘pro-Jew' forces dismantled the tariff system and chipped away at our national economic barriers, leading to the grave problems we see now.
The question of ‘Free Trade' or a robust National Economy is one of either/or. If you accept Free Trade, then you will just be integrated into the global economic melting pot, and you should expect a living standard no better than the average Asiatic peasant. That's the reality of the situation. On the other hand, if you support (and are willing to fight for) a robust National Economy where assets and resources are protected, then you can expect your standard of living to also be protected. It's that simple. We Whites have a higher standard of living for the most obvious of reasons – we are simply more capable of producing a well functioning society than others. It's none of that crap about privilege! We are more adept at creating and running healthy societies, so why shouldn't we protect our living standards? There is no logical reason why we shouldn't!
As we know, the Free Trade Agreements are reached every time one of our gutless Jew-controlled politicians goes on a holiday to New York to meet with the Jews at the U.N. As they create more and more Free Trade Agreements, it stands to reason that the new FTA's are going to knock down bigger ‘barriers' every time. They all started off small – just knocking down National Trade barriers to consolidate into regional blocks. Now things are really accelerating since the Jew Fractional Reserve Debt-based money system is forcing their hand (Ponzi Scheme out of control). Regional blocks are now being integrated just to keep the money system going – all at the expense of our way of life!
Another powerful weapon in the propaganda armoury of the Communist Jews at the U.N. is the Global Warming or ‘Climate Change' hoax. This hoax is the key to successfully guilt-tripping all the White Nations into allowing their industries to be shut down. You are supposed to feel guilty about all that horrible polluting the evil White man has done over the last hundred years, and from there you are supposed to turn a blind eye to your country being shut down. “After all, it'll help stop Climate Change if we de-industrialise – let's set an example for the rest of the world”, says the ‘do-gooder' White, all the while ignoring the fact that China and India and every other third-world cesspit nation will just carry on polluting (and they do real polluting, not the harmless CO2 style ‘polluting' these idiots are going on about). Since Free Trade Agreements have led to western de-industrialisation, you can see how handy this Global Warming hoax is in getting White western populations to accept their own economic demise. These Communist Jews are experts at disguising their true motives – most think Global Warming/Climate Change is about the environment, when in reality it is about dissolving the White western economies so we are even more subservient to World Jewry!
The Fractional Reserve Debt-based Money & Usury System
The money system we live under in the western world is nothing more than a giant Ponzi Scheme run by the ‘you-know-who's'. The basic principle underlying the system is that of Debt-based money. Every single dollar which is circulated via government is done so under the condition that it must be paid back to the bank at a later date. Even if there were no interest (usury) to be paid back, the net result of paying off the ‘national debt' would mean that no money would be in circulation (and the debt would be settled when no-one has a single cent left! Haha)!
Anyway, as if the Jews needed to make matters worse, they decided to also charge interest for the ‘privilege' of using their debt money, of which most has no reserve sitting behind it backing it up! Fractional Reserve means exactly that. The bank is supposed to issue money as a receipt for the deposits we make (usually in gold or silver). The catch is that no-one outside the banks high level management has any idea how much the bank really has in deposits. This is why the cunning Jew thought, “Oh well, what the hell? I could just print off more receipts (money) than I have in real reserves (gold/silver), and no-one would be any the wiser!” Turns out the evil bastard Jew was right. No-one caught onto his sly little trick (well, not in modern times anyway)! So essentially, the bank lends out roughly ten times more money than it actually has in reserves, then charges us interest for the privilege! Therefore the Jew banker also makes ten times more interest than what you would think! I don't believe that any of the big Jew banks would keep anywhere near the 10:1 or 9:1 ratio that they claim they do. We know what Jews are like – rather greedy from my observations.
This video explains everything without naming the Jew. It's child's play to connect the dots:
The simple principle to remember with Jew Fractional Reserve Debt Money is this: every dollar that goes into circulation has to be paid back to the Jew, plus interest. So, to keep it simple, 10% interest on $1 into the system means $1.10 must eventually come out, right? You can see how this creates problems for governments trying to pay their debts to Mr. Jew! If the system only received $1 then it's literally impossible to get $1.10 out of it without asking for new ‘loans' to cover the extra 10%. So when payment of the old loan is due, all they (government) do is take out a new one to cover the unpaid principal and interest on the old one. A Ponzi Scheme by definition! Because of the impossible nature of sustaining this system forever as things inevitably worsen financially, the only other way to get money to pay off old debts is to start selling all the nations assets and resources. Sounds familiar doesn't it? This generates the much-needed cash flow to keep the dying system afloat, but it's a bit like trying to stop someone from bleeding to death by wrapping a bandage on their wound, even though they are going to bleed out regardless (like sticking a band-aid on a severed leg).
The principles behind the Fractional Reserve Jew Debt system explain why they absolutely must keep expanding and merging things together. This Fractional Reserve Capitalist Jew Ponzi Scheme makes it necessary for us to enter into the Communist Jew United Nations Free Trade Agreements. Without all the Free Trade Agreements, our western nations wouldn't have been able to tap into the slave labour markets in Asia, and the Ponzi scheme which is reliant upon continual growth would have run out of steam a while back. That's the real reason for Free Trade and its ever expanding nature. The Capitalist Jew Debt Money system on one hand, then the Communist U.N. apparatus to compliment it on the other, and there you go: two sides of the one Jewish coin! Neither is correct, moral nor sound-economic-thinking in any sense, but the Fractional Reserve Debt system forces things to work like this. Only when you know that it is the Jew behind both the Capitalistic and Communistic financial scheming, can you see how and why things are set up like they are. The Jew always portrays himself as if other Jews are working against him. That is enough to fool most intelligent people, but when you know that these ‘opposing' forces are actually working together, like in this case; it isn't too hard to identify the unified group pulling all the strings! When you understand that the Jews control ‘International Finance', it isn't exactly a giant leap-of-faith to believe that they control everything else too. In fact, it would be a giant leap-of-faith to believe that they didn't control everything else!
Adolf Hitler understood exactly how the ‘two sides of the one Jewish coin' worked together. He knew that the Debt and Usury Jew Capitalist system was set up and designed to fail in such a way that served Jewry, like in Weimar Germany. When it failed the International Jew speculators were waiting eagerly to pounce and buy up all Germany's assets for virtually nothing while the German people starved and lost all their savings. Although it is true that these international Jew speculators were indeed Capitalists on one hand, they would later create the United Nations as a Communistic Internationalist organisation. Seemingly strange behaviour for committed Capitalists, but a Jew will become whatever best serves his tribes interests at the drop of a hat! The U.N. through their ‘loving & caring' sounding communist terminology could then manipulate public minds world-wide and deliver the rotting economic bodies of the west (under the Jew Debt/Usury system) into the hands of even more powerful international Jew Capitalist banks. This was always the plan and Adolf Hitler knew what the Jews were up to:
“I began to study again, and now for the first time really achieved an understanding of the content of the Jew Karl Marx's life effort. Only now did his ‘Das Kapital' become really intelligible to me, and also the struggle of the Social Democracy against the national economy, which aims only to prepare the ground for the domination of truly international finance and stock exchange capital.”
(The way I translate this quote in my head is like this: International Jew Karl Marx = Social Democracy = Communism = natural inclination to destroy national economy = same function the U.N. provides in the modern scenario = eventual deliverance to International Jewish Capitalism)
Finally, I have two telling quotes: the Jewish Rothschild family's attitude to money, then the aim of World Jewry explained by a Rothschild agent:
“Give me control of a nation's money supply, and I care not who makes its laws”
– Amschel Rothschild, International Jew-banker-extraordinaire.
“We shall have world government whether or not you like it… the only question is whether or not it is by conquest or consent.”
– James Warburg, Jew Rothschild Banking Agent, 1950
– BDL1983

The Boombox crew and our 16 Bars sponsor Honda made history at Le Poisson Rouge in New York with the 16 Bars Live event on Thursday night (July 31). MTV's Rob Markman and "Battle Rap Ambassador" Poison Pen were the hosts of the event which featured a some of the top battle rappers in the game.
Rap battle veterans like Immortal Technique, Mickey Factz and Jin were in attendance to not only see The Roots' Black Thought rock the mic with his DJ J. Period, but also to witness three lyrical duels between four hard-hitting battle rappers. The stakes were high as the winner of the tournament would get his own "16 Bars" episode.
After Hot 97's DJ E-Stylez's opening set of modern hip-hop classics and the introduction of the four battle contestants by Markman and Pen, the audience saw the first match up: New Jersey's own Lotta Zay versus Los Angeles native Danny Myers .
Zay wasn't even scheduled to be on the bill but was added after contestant Rosenberg Raw pulled out two days before the show. Zay lost the coin toss and thus went first. The rapper came roaring out of the gate with floods of complex rhyme schemes, but while those impressed some onlookers, it was his comedy that won the room over. KRS-One, DJ Jazzy Jeff and Will Smith references sent cackles through the venue, and though Danny Myers got tenacious by the end, he was no match for Zay's wit.

Then it was time for the Team Homi vet Swave Sevah to face off against Pittsburgh's own Real Deal . After Swave won the toss and deferred to his opponent, Real Deal got the crowd on his side by cracking on Swave for still rocking braids in 2014. Sevah shot back by exposing Real's day job -- a gym teacher.
Then in the second round, Swave pretended Real was a plainclothes cop, eliciting more laughter from the crowd, but Real had him right where he wanted him. In the final round, Swave choked and couldn't seem to come up with the rest of his verse. That was the crowd's excuse to give it up for Real Deal, and a final showdown against Lotta Zay was in place.
Spencer Kaufman for TheBoombox.com
The final battle was a thriller. Zay was all charisma, throwing clever punchlines left and right, but once more, Real was prepared to out-perform his opponent. In the final round, the Pittsburgh rapper started running around the stage, asking the crowd to yell out words he would then riff off of.
One person threw out "New Jersey" and another attendee yelled "orange." Real fielded them all as Zay watched on in amazement, and even though the final vote was so close that Poison Pen had to call up hosts Rob Markman and Boombox editor Timmhotep to deliberate.
The whole room knew that Real Deal had stolen the show. The white gym teacher wearing Gap FUBU jeans prevailed. You'll see his '16 Bars' segment soon.
Spencer Kaufman fro TheBoombox.com
Afterward, the audience was treated to J. Period scratching on the 1's and 2's and a rap performance from Black Thought of the legendary Roots crew.
Berman Fenelus for TheBoombox.com
Thought proceeded to shred the mic for almost an hour over nothing but vintage hip-hop breaks. No band, no late night host, no comedy -- just an MC, a DJ, and the sounds of Clyde Stubblefield 's funky drumming. The Philly rapper was impeccable on the mic, even asking J. Period to cut the beat so he could go a cappella once or twice.
By the end, Thought was dropping punchlines about getting force-fed like his boy Mos Def. The crowd ate up every word, and when Thought left the stage it felt like we'd just been transported back in time to the days of Latin Quarters. Fans swarmed Thought for pictures and he sweetly obliged before disappearing backstage.

Former USC Trojans place kicker Matt Boermeester has been removed from school. (Photo11: Robert Hanashiro-USA TODAY Sport)
Former Southern California kicker Matt Boermeester was removed from school because of a Title IX investigation that his girlfriend Zoe Katz says was "horrible and unfair," according to a report by the Los Angeles Times.
Boremeester was accused of shoving Katz outside her home, something both of them deny happening.
According to the Times, Katz said that she and Boermeester have been dating for more than a year and a neighbor saw them "roughhousing." It got back to a USC coach that Boermeester was abusing Katz, and he reported it to the Title IX office.
Katz told the Times that he has “never been abused, assaulted or otherwise mistreated by Matt.”
In a meeting with the Title IX office, she said the officials painted her as being a battered woman who was afraid of Boermeester.
“Matt Boermeester did nothing improper against me, ever,” Katz said in a statement, according to the Times. “I would not stand for it. Nor will I stand for watching him be maligned and lied about.”
Boermeester was suspended by the school in February while the investigation was taking place and hasn't been allowed to return.
About a month before he was suspended, Boermeester made a 46-yard field goal as time expired to end USC's 52-49 victory against Penn State in the Rose Bowl. He made 18 of 25 field goal attempts last season.

One of the things that the Trump administration has gotten right this year has been on the regulatory front, working with Congress to undo a score of Obama midnight regulations, rescinding the onerous Waters of the United States rulemaking regulating every puddle in America and leaving the Paris climate accord.
The new and existing coal power plant regulations are under review by the Environmental Protection Agency, with major modifications or even rescissions expected.
The Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines were approved, permits for drilling and mining on federal lands are being expedited. The U.S. has added almost 50,000 mining jobs since December and new coal mines are finally opening up.
In the financial industry, the Department of Justice's Operation Chokepoint targeting lenders has ended.
Permitting for manufacturers is being streamlined and expedited.
Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson has promised to “reinterpret” the Obama regulation, Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing, that conditions HUD funding on municipalities redrawing local zoning based on racial and income considerations.
These are all very positive developments, and this is just a snapshot. There is a lot more the Trump administration has been doing on the regulatory front. The President is doing his job on regulations — and on getting tough on trade for that matter.
Unfortunately, to get the U.S. economy really moving again, simply making changes to the regulatory framework can and will only go so far. The economy has not grown above 3 percent since 2005, and not above 4 percent since 2000, and almost a decade after the financial crisis, there remain millions of working age adults not in the workforce but who should be.
To end that losing streak, Congress still has a critical role to play, particularly on taxes, infrastructure and repealing Obamacare. Trump cannot do this all by himself.
Making matters worse, Republican leaders in Congress appear powerless to unite factions within their own conferences — squandering a once in a generation opportunity where Republicans control the House, Senate, and White House. So far almost no progress has been made on these signature GOP legislative issues needed to boost the economy and create the jobs Americans need.
Only two Republican presidents since the Great Depression besides Trump have had that privilege, Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953 to 1954 and George W. Bush from 2003 to 2006. Sadly, not much was accomplished during these brief periods of power.
In the meantime, every single Democrat president since Franklin D. Roosevelt had Democrat majorities in Congress the year they were elected, greasing the wheels for the New Deal, Great Society, Carter, Clinton and Obama eras. During these years, much of the social welfare state and massive bureaucracy was built that defines the federal government today.
Ironically, Republican presidents have had more luck legislatively with at least partially controlled Democrat Congresses. Eisenhower got interstate highways with Democrat majorities. Reagan got tax cuts and defense spending with the House controlled by Democrats; although Republicans held the Senate majority from 1981 through 1986.
Incidentally, Trump is far more popular among Republicans than the Republican Congress—and yet GOP Congressmen act like they are not the pariahs. Pollster Tony Fabrizio finds that the GOP Congress' disapproval — among Republicans — has risen to 46 percent. 46 percent, that's incredible. Trump still enjoys 75 percent approval among Republicans, and that would be much higher if leaders of Congress would do their jobs.
The point is, if the Trump agenda does not get moving in Congress, including on taxes, infrastructure, the wall and repealing Obamacare, it is Republicans in Congress who will pay the price electorally in 2018 — not Trump, who might be looking to make a different deal with Democrats in 2019 to get the economy moving. That means for House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, it's now or never.

At the ripe age of 38, former middleweight title challenger and current welterweight contender, Demian Maia realizes the four-fight winning streak he currently has going could be the last chance to conquer a UFC belt in his career, so as he sees it, a good win over his next opponent, Matt Brown, should put him right up there for a shot against the champion.
Besides, as he told Combate, he doesn't think the ranking system works that well to truly define a number one contender.
"If we are talking about the sport my title shot is a sure thing, provided I beat Matt Brown. Of course there's the business part, so I can't know for sure. But if he is the number four, five or six welterweight in the rankings makes no difference. That's always changing. We know who is who. There's little difference in the Top 10. It's all about how certain journalists feel about fighters. One day you could be numbed four and the next one you could be numbed six. Whoever understands this sport knows that if I win, I should fight for the belt."
With four wins over the likes of Gunnar Nelson, Neil Magny, Ryan LaFlare and Alexander Yakovlev, Maia says another victory over "The Imortal" should seal the deal for him.
"I consider Brown a great muay thai fighter, he has great knees and elbows, so I must do my homework. I haven't studied him yet because the fight has just been scheduled, but it won't be easy. I could win, but I could also get hurt during the fight and lose, because he's an efficient guy. If I win, I'll have eight wins in the weight class and five in a row, against a really tough guy. I think that will secure my title shot."
Demian Maia will fight Matt Brown at UFC Fight Night 87, on May 14 in Brazil. A city has not been determined by the UFC yet. A middleweight fight between middleweight contenders Vitor Belfort and Ronaldo Jacare will be the main event of the evening.
Police faced criticism yesterday for their handling of the Tottenham riots before and after the worst of the violence broke out.

Senior officers were accused of failing to respond to the family and friends of Mark Duggan when they marched to Tottenham police station on Saturday evening.
And they were also accused of standing back and allowing rioters to cause havoc in the hours after.
Police had questions to answer about how the chaos could have spread, said Tottenham MP David Lammy .
One officer patrolling Tottenham High Road yesterday was challenged by an elderly resident on why the police had not been more forceful the previous night.
He replied: âThe way we look at it, weâre damned if we do and weâre damned if donât.â
Another resident who did not want to be named said: âIâm not criticising the police but I donât know how it was allowed to spread so far up the road.â

Josh Blair, owner of the burnt-out post office building, blamed theÂ rioters, saying: âThey have smashed in the shops where they shop and the post office where they collect their benefits. Itâs like biting the hand that feeds.â

However, Stafford Scott, one of the demonstrators on Saturday, said trouble flared only after four hours of waiting for a senior police officer to discuss Mr Dugganâs death. He added: âThe reason I believe this happened is because police have paid disregard to the family. Had they dealt with us earlier in the day, we would have removed ourselves.â
He described the violence as an âexplosionâ of anger over widespread unemployment, frequent stop-and-search checks by police and expulsions from schools.
Mr Lammy raised concerns after Mr Dugganâs death that tensions were rising between residents and the police. As he spoke in the High Road yesterday, some in the crowd shouted: âThe police want to see the place burn.â
Metropolitan Police commander Adrian Hanstock insisted there had been âno indicationâ that trouble would flare as it did.
He said: âSaturdayâs peaceful demonstration was hijacked by a small number of criminal elements, who used that for their own gain.
âThe looting, the damage, the concern that has been caused to businesses and people who have lost their homes and their livelihoods is absolutely unacceptable.â
He added: âWe brought appropriate resources in to contain the area.âPolice Federation chairman Paul McKeever, said: âThere is no excuse for such total disregard of life and property and I know my colleagues will do everything in their power to ensure those responsible for these atrocities are brought to justice.â

Recently I saw Stuart Gordon's play Taste, which was inspired by a real life incidence of cannibalism.
“It is amazing to me that there is so much about cannibalism in the papers these days,” Gordon told me after the performance, “and when we first announced that we were going to do this the response to it was bigger than any play or movie I've ever done. It went through the roof. I felt like we were hitting a nerve here.”
Gordon loves cooking shows so naturally he would be drawn to a play about people who eat each other. What excited Gordon about doing a play involving cannibalism was the “the idea of having a cooking show where you actually smell the cooking. That's the thing the theater can do that movies can't do is really engage the senses.”
The play, written by Ben Brand, was a brilliant mix of subtlety and sensationalism. All this made me think about cannibal films.
Cannibal films – in which people mindlessly slaughter and eat others or where carnage soaks the screen – are a dime a dozen. But films in which great care is taken with both the filmmaking and the preparation of human flesh for consumption are rarer. Since the French are renowned for food I will turn to them to help make this distinction clear. I would define the typical cannibal film as something suited for a gourmand, a ravenous and greedy eater, prone to excess, but not too discriminating in what he eats. But the gourmet cannibal film is for a connoisseur, a person with a discerning palate and who prefers items that are exotic or of high quality.
So forget about the bloody excesses of Cannibal Holocaust or Texas Chainsaw Massacre and treat your palate to these elegant gourmet cannibal films. (NOTE: Some descriptions contain spoilers.)
1. The Cook The Thief His Wife and Her Lover (1989)
Peter Greenaway's delectable art house favorite serves up the perfect example of the gourmet cannibal film. Shot, superbly crafted, and stunningly acted, this film explores the extremes of human jealousy, cruelty, and revenge. Albert is a brutal crime boss who also owns a swanky restaurant with an artisan chef named Richard. Albert's wife Georgina (played the the scrumptious Helen Mirren) grows bored with her brutish spouse and strikes up an affair with a kind bookseller. The cook covers for the lovers who sometimes conduct their covert affair in the restaurant bathroom as Albert consumes a meal. But Albert eventually catches on and murders his wife's lover. Georgina comes to Richard and tells him, ‘He's dead. They stuffed him with pages torn from his favorite book. Could you cook him?' And so begins her revenge. Richard prepares the man's corpse like a work of art and Georgina presents it to her husband, ‘Try the cock, Albert. It's a delicacy, and you know where it's been.' Georgina concludes the film with the line: “Cannibal.” This is a four-star gourmet cannibal film.
2. Delicatessen (1991)
Here's another art house film that tackles cannibalism in an unexpected manner. French directors Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro deliver an exquisitely crafted film about a post-apocalyptic world where food is scarce and cannibalism is rampant. The film takes place almost exclusively inside an apartment building where an enterprising butcher comes up with a clever plan to keep the tenants well stocked with meat. He keeps hiring handymen for the building and when the time is right, he butchers them and sells them as meat. His latest handyman is an unemployed clown and a vegetarian. The butcher's daughter falls in love with him and enlists the aid of the Troglodytes, an under-the-ground vegetarian group that tries to save people from the cannibals. Jeunet and Caro are not interested in making a horror film or in showing gore. Their film is a delicious black comedy that's surprisingly full of whimsy despite the flesh eating.
3. Parents (1989)
Another black comedy on the subject of cannibalism is Bob Balaban's Parents. Young Michael lives in a model '50s suburban neighborhood with his parents (the perfectly cast Randy Quaid and Mary Beth Hurt). Everything seems perfectly Ozzie and Harriet on the surface but Michael is haunted by nightmares and an uneasy concern over where his cheerful parents get their meat. Imagine Ward Cleaver cooking flesh burgers on the grill and June serving them to the neighbors and you'll get an idea of the perversely funny incongruity of the film. Balaban puts a glossy Technicolor surface on his disturbingly funny tale of suburban cannibals.
4. Silence of the Lambs (1991) / Hannibal (2001)
The horror gets kicked up as well as the gourmet food preparation in a pair of films featuring Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. In Silence of the Lambs, Hopkins has a memorable scene where he tells Jodie Foster's FBI agent, “A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti.” In the sequel Hannibal, we get to see Hopkins' serial killer/gourmet cannibal prepare Ray Liotta's brain for consumption. The nasty chef's trick is that he slices off gray matter while the man is still alive and conscious. Hopkins makes these films a gourmet treat.
5. The Green Butchers (2003)
The Danish film The Green Butchers returns us to a lighter tone and in an odd bit of irony stars Mads Mikkelsen (who now plays Hannibal on NBC's TV series). The Green Butchers of the title are Svend and Bjarne, who decide to open their own shop to get away from their obnoxious boss Holger. Of course Holger comes by to mock them when no customers show up. But on a whim, their old boss orders some meat for a dinner party. In the meantime, Svend accidentally locks an electrician in the meat locker when he's fixing the light and is in desperate need of disposing of the body. One thing leads to another and Svend ends up marinating the electrician's leg and giving the meat to Holger for his party. The next day there's a line around shop with people demanding “Svend's chicky-wickies” (his euphemism for the human flesh marinated in his special sauce). Another charming and tastefully delivered tale on cannibalism.
6. We Are What We Are (2013)
Cannibalism becomes a kind of religious ritual in Jim Mickle's superb remake of the Mexican cannibal horror film Somos lo que hay. Mickle's film gives us a reclusive family headed by patriarch Frank Parker (Bill Sage). He runs his family with fierce sense of conviction to his ancestral traditions. The film begins as his daughters are forced to assume some horrific family customs. The spin Mickle gives this tale of modern day cannibalism is to endow it with a religious, Puritan spin. He doesn't shy away from gore but unlike the typical cannibal film he finds unexpected beauty in the brutality.
7. Titus (1999)
There is really just one brief reference to cannibalism in Julie Taymor's adaptation of Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus but it's so vivid and horrific yet elegantly executed that it merits inclusion here. This is one of Shakespeare's bloodiest plays full of senseless violence and cruelty. At one point Titus (Anthony Hopkins once again serving human flesh) finally secures an opportunity to exact revenge on his bitter enemy Tamora. His choice of vengeance is particularly cruel and clever. He kills her sons and serves them to her in a pie.
8. The Untold Story (1993)
This Category III (equivalent of the MPAA X or NC-17 rating) Hong Kong film, like Stuart Gordon's play, finds its inspiration in real life. It's based on a true crime that supposedly took place in 1985 in Macau. Anthony Wong plays a man who kills a family and takes over their restaurant. The restaurant specializes in “pork bao” or steamed pork buns and perhaps the film's alternate title — Human Pork Buns — will make clear where the cannibalism comes into play. The film is gruesomely violent but the human flesh is prepared with care and served up to unsuspecting customers.
9. Sweeney Todd (2007)
Sweeney Todd also looks to a sensational true crime as the basis for its story. Sweeney Todd, aka The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, sounds more like the stuff of urban legends than reality. But evidence suggests that there really was a mad barber who used a straight razor to kill his customers and many of the victims' bodies ended up as filling for meat pies. Tim Burton's film, based on Stephen Sondheim's musical, makes light of the horror as Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter slit throats and serve meat pies to gullible patrons.
10. Eating Raoul (1982)
This indie black comedy from Paul Bartel and Mary Woronov has become a cult classic. Bartel and Woronov play Paul and Mary Bland, a couple who want to open their own restaurant. They happen upon a scheme to raise money when Paul accidentally kills a errant swinger who's forcing himself on Mary. The man is loaded with cash so the Blands decide to start luring other swingers to their pad and offing them with the fry pan. This works pretty well until a sexy Latin con man named Raoul starts to horn in on their business. The title implies multiple meanings but I think you can guess how the film, with its wannabe restaurant owners, ends up. What makes this film such a gourmet item is the deadpan performances of Bartel and Woronov.
The Internet is full of filth. From “barely legal babes” to barely avoidable male-enhancement spam, something risqué seems to be lurking around every corner online.
Yet in an age where amateur action may be more accessible than early American literature, some families are finding that Internet service providers have drawn the line on obscenity at a rather surprising place: Their own names, they're being told by Web professionals, are too vulgar for the Web.
What's in a Name?
Before you think I've gone off the deep end, allow me to introduce you to an unassuming little town in North Lincolnshire, England. About a hour's drive northeast of Sheffield, it's a place known as the steel-producing capital of the United Kingdom–but that distinction pales in comparison to its real claim to fame lies: its name. Welcome to Scunthorpe.
The name Scunthorpe–whose unassuming syllables are pronounced as “scun” and “thorpe”–is believed to be derived from an Old Norse word, “escumetorp,” meaning “farmstead belonging to Skuma.” But the name's etymology isn't what made it notorious.
Scunthorpe first entered the American vernacular around 1996, back in the Internet's infancy. That's when, legend has it, AOL's automated filtering system kept Scunthorpians from registering for accounts because of a certain sequence of four letters found within their town's name. As recently as 2004, services like Google's SafeSearch reportedly were still flagging Web sites that contained the term.
All of those episodes of misplaced nannydom led to the christening of a new term, the “Scunthorpe Problem,” referring to the blocking of an otherwise unobjectionable name because an unintended naughty word resides within its borders. It's something that residents of the South Yorkshire town of Penistone, which is about an hour west of Scunthorpe, know well, as do families living in England's less blatantly blasphemous village of Lightwater (look carefully), which is about 3 hours south of Scunthorpe.
So what's in a name? A lot, it would seem, especially in the automated matrix of the Information Age. But the Scunthorpe Problem isn't limited to geographic locations. Get ready to meet a retired radiologist who unexpectedly found his life shifting from X-rays to accusations of being X-rated.
Virtual Rejection
Dr. Herman I. Libshitz is used to people giving him, uh, crap about his name. The doctor, raised in Philadelphia and now living in Chestertown, Maryland, learned early on he'd have to defend his family's honor.
“When you're named Libshitz, you expect problems with your name,” he says. “Can you imagine what a drill sergeant did with Libshitz?”
Still, Libshitz's foray into cyberspace proved more irksome than the teasing he had endured in his younger years. It started around 1998, when he and his wife bought a computer and tried to sign up for an AOL account.
“AOL told me my name was insulting and offensive,” he remembers. “They wouldn't give me an e-mail address.”
Libshitz fought and won that battle. But it was only the beginning. Fast-forward to July 2008, when Libshitz and his wife decided to upgrade their home Internet service from dial-up to broadband. They logged on to Verizon's Web site only to find that, once again, the ISP wouldn't accept their name for use in an e-mail address.
“Verizon could use my name in the phonebook. They could use my name to bill me. Lord knows they cash my checks with my name on it,” Libshitz says. “But somehow, as an e-mail address, it wasn't good. That offended me. I told them it was fine when Uncle Sam wanted me to be in the military, and I proudly served.”
Four phone calls and a rotating lineup of unseen supervisors proved inadequate to the task of solving the Libshitz issue. Finally, a reporter from the Philadelphia Inquirer managed to get through to someone at Verizon to discuss the doctor's DSL purchase problems and ultimately to reverse the decision declaring his last name off-limits.
“They condescended to let me use my own name as an e-mail address. Wasn't that gracious?” Libshitz remarks.
What happened to Libshitz is hardly unique. More than 150 families with Libshitz variations as their name are listed in New York City alone, and it's by no means the only name to run afoul of the Scunthorpe Problem. Just ask Craig Cockburn, who has resorted to replacing the “o” in his last name with a zero to get around filters.
Nor are the tastemeisters at Delicacy Central limiting their vetos to instances of buried accidental profanity. Until just a couple of years ago, according to reports, some providers banned names that contained the word “Allah”; eventually Yahoo reversed its ban, which had made addressing difficult for people named Callahan (among others).
Service Provider Policies
The major national ISPs remain reluctant to discuss their policies on acceptable e-mail address names–or to offer guidance to people regarding what rights they have with regard to using their legitimate family names. I did a little digging and discovered that a person named “Lipshitz” could create an account with Microsoft Hotmail or with Yahoo Mail and not run into any trouble. Try the same operation with AOL Mail, Comcast, Gmail, or Verizon, though, and–if you're a Lipshitz–you'll get turned away. (If you're a Cockburn, you won't fare much better.)
Of the four nay-saying providers, only two were up-front in discussing their policies. Verizon's spokesperson explained that “if the language is objectionable and obvious,” the network won't “permit it to be used in an e-mail account address.” On the other hand, he said, anyone with a valid name-based reason to use that language in an address could contact Verizon's staff and request an exception.
AOL's spokesperson said that the company's filters do block certain “strings of words and particular terms,” including any phrases deemed to be “sexually explicit or vulgar.” She also emphasized that users who encounter specific problems with the filters can make individual requests.
Comcast did not respond to my request for comment. When I visited its Web site chat interface as a potential customer, however, and asked a representative about creating an account with the name “Lipshitz,” the rep told me that the system would block it: “I am sorry, the same with other providers, username with profanity words are not allowed by the server.”
As for Gmail, a spokesperson responding by sending me two basic excerpts from the service's online FAQ–one explaining that a username may be unavailable to “prevent spam or abuse,” and another explaining why all usernames must contain at least six letters. When I tried to obtain specifics about the policy and to ask about the best course of action for people with blocked names, the spokesperson stopped responding to my calls and e-mail messages.
AT&T did not respond to multiple requests for information. I attempted to log on to its online chat interface as a customer, but its representatives told me I would have to complete the sign-up process before I could see whether any specific username would be accepted.
George Carlin's Seven Dirty Words
For what it's worth, the Webmail providers are split when it comes to blocking the “seven dirty words” made famous by George Carlin's comedy routine. (Don't click through to this list if you are easily offended. In fact, if you're easily offended, why are you reading this story at all?)
Of the seven that Carlin identifies, we've already covered the one that cost Dr. Libshitz so much grief. Four of the other entries–the two most obviously vulgar four-letter words and the two multisyllable selections–are banned at AOL Mail, Google, Hotmail, and Yahoo. The two remaining words on Carlin's list, curiously enough, are permitted at all four Webmail providers.
Your Name, Not Your Right
So where does all of this leave the Libshitzes and Cockburns–not to mention the Heinie Manushes–of the world? Nine times out of ten, they may just be out of luck.
“As a basic tenet of American law, you do not necessarily have a right to use your name,” explains Theodore Claypoole, an attorney specializing in intellectual property and consumer data treatment with the law firm of Womble, Carlyle, Sandridge, and Rice.
Claypoole likens the situation to vanity license plates. States have certain restrictions on what words can and cannot be used. E-mail, he says, is no different: “You may have a right to use your name to describe you. You do not have the right to use your name on anything that you do.”
A similar controversy arose a few years ago in connection with official National Football League merchandise. A Louisiana State University professor whose former student Randall Gay had become a cornerback for the New England Patriots was surprised to learn that she couldn't buy a Patriots jersey bearing Gay's surname and number, due to what NFLshop.com termed a “naughty word” violation; later, however, the Web site rescinded that ban. (There was no word on how “New England” managed to pass muster.)
For Herman Libshitz, the issue is less about legality and more about moral standards–standards that he believes are being asserted inconsistently.
“I think it's hypocrisy that they're ‘saving us from profanity' by not letting people use their surnames,” he says. “I mean, these are the same providers that permit all sorts of pornography to go over their lines. If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what is.”
For now, the situation remains unresolved. Libshitz managed to triumph in his own personal struggle, but his victory hasn't reached far. Future generations will undoubtedly face the same burden of fighting obscenity filters and justifying single syllables–in essence, of struggling to avoid virtual citizenship in an unassuming town in North Lincolnshire, England.

ROSEMONT, Ill. – The Chicago Wolves unleashed a five-goal barrage in the first period and cruised to a 9-5 triumph over the Charlotte Checkers on Saturday night at Allstate Arena. Forwards Danny Kristo, Ty Rattie, Pat Cannone, Magnus Paajarvi and Ivan Barbashev each contributed 3 points — Barbashev the only one with 2 goals — while forward Jordan Caron and defensemen Scooter Vaughan and Andre Benoit notched the other goals for the Wolves (2-1-0-0).
“We talked about it before we came on the ice,” said Wolves head coach John Anderson. “Last night, we didn't play very well in the first period, so I wanted them to bring it right away. We had a bit of jump. We gave up 5 goals, but I'd take 60 9-5 wins a year.”
The Wolves opened the scoring with Kristo's goal exactly as a power play expired at 4:44 of the first. Paajarvi and Peter Harrold fed the puck to the end boards for Kristo, who darted toward the net and squeezed a quick backhand past Charlotte starter Rasmus Tirronen.
Charlotte (3-1-0-0) recovered quickly as former Wolves defenseman Jake Chelios elevated a blast past goaltender Jordan Binnington at 5:20 to make it 1-1.
Chicago regained the lead at 7:26 when Vaughan, making his Wolves debut, stepped into a shot in the high slot and knuckled the puck beyond Tirronen's glove. Vaughan's goal prompted Charlotte coach Mark Morris to insert goaltender Drew MacIntyre into the fray.
MacIntyre didn't have much of a chance on Benoit's power-play goal at 13:02 of the first that pushed the Wolves' margin to 3-1. Cannone and Kristo executed quick passes and the puck skidded to the high slot to Benoit, who guided it through heavy traffic and MacIntyre as well.
Charlotte cut the lead to 3-2 at 15:09 as the Checkers took advantage of a 5-on-3 power play with defenseman Trevor Carrick's blast from the right point.
The Wolves capped their first-period outburst with goals from Rattie and Cannone 53 seconds apart during 4-on-4 action. Rattie scored at 17:41 when Ivan Barbashev won a faceoff to set up Rattie's wrister from the right circle, then Rattie set up Cannone in the slot for a one-timer that required video replay to confirm the goal.
Chicago picked up where it left off with Jordan Caron's blast from the slot at 4:30 of the second. Rattie set him up to earn his third point of the night.
Paajarvi earned his goal when he crashed the net and tipped Konrad Abeltshauser's snapper from the left point at 10:03. Kristo also picked up an assist for his third point while Charlotte replaced MacIntyre with Tirronen.
After Charlotte notched a pair of third-period goals, Barbashev delivered his first professional goal with a deft backhanded flip past Tirronen to make it 8-4 at 11:51. Barbashev didn't wait long for his next one as he scored from the slot with 29 seconds to go to push the final margin to 9-5.
Binnington (2-0-0) rejected 23 of 28 shots for the win while MacIntyre (2-1-0) took the loss after posting 7 saves on 12 shots. Tirronen stopped 14 of 18.
The Wolves play their first road game 7 p.m. Friday at Rockford before returning to Allstate Arena at 3 p.m. Sunday for Breast Cancer Awareness Day, which benefits A Silver Lining Foundation and Chicago Wolves Charities.

This hospital is using Fitbit devices to help its patients get home sooner 9:00 AM ET Sat, 2 Dec 2017 | 01:37
Getting out of bed after a surgery is often a challenge. At Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, the doctors have figured out a new way to motivate patients: Fitbits.
The hospital is giving out Fitbit activity trackers to its patients after knee replacements, hip replacements and other surgeries, to encourage them to start walking short distances.
For healthy people, 10,000 steps a day is a typical goal. But the doctors at Cedars-Sinai found that patients that reach even 1,000 steps are usually discharged sooner than those who don't.
"Patients need to walk after they've had a surgery," said Brennan Spiegel, director of health services research at Cedars-Sinai, in an interview with CNBC. "There are decades of research, so we know that."
Spiegel is among the medical professionals who started working with Fitbit as the company expanded beyond the consumer market and into research and clinical studies. Fitbit told CNBC in September that it's unfazed by rivals like Apple and Samsung, in part due to the company's focus on health and medical applications.
This is what profit sharing should look like.
The CEO and co-founder of Turkish food delivery company Yemeksepeti has paid out $27 million to 114 employees after selling the firm for $589 million.
Nevzat Aydin said his employees deserved to benefit from the company's sale to Germany's Delivery Hero.
"Yemeksepeti's success story did not happen overnight and many people participated in this journey with their hard work and talent," he told CNNMoney.
The startup was launched 15 years ago by Aydin and three colleagues. It now has 370 employees, delivering over three million meals every month.
The bonuses are worth $237,000 on average. They were paid from the proceeds of the sale of the company.
How much each employee received was based on their performance, how long they had worked for the firm, and their "future potential in the company," Aydin said. Only employees who had been with the company for two years were eligible.
Aydin's employees are paid between $1,000 and $2,000 a month. That means the average payout is worth roughly 150 times their monthly wage, and tops the average Wall Street bonus for 2014 by $65,000.
Nedim Nahmias is one of the employees who received a bonus. He started as a call center operator 10 years ago, before working his way up to become chief operating officer.
He knew his boss had plans for the payout, but had no idea of the amount.
"The conversation became very emotional for both of us," he said. "This bonus package is life changing to many of us."
Nahmias, who got engaged recently, would not say how much he was paid. "Let's just say the money I received will cover many potential expenses of a soon-to-be married couple," he said.
Yemeksepeti is one of the most successful tech brands in Turkey. It also operates in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar and Jordan.
Delivery Hero said the bonus plan had been decided before the acquisition, but said it approved of the idea.
"The success of companies like Delivery Hero and Yemeksepeti is based on amazing company cultures where tremendous people always walk the extra mile," spokesman Bodo von Braunmuehl said.
"We have in the past, and will in the future, continue to also share some of the success with those," he said.
Aydin, who first revealed the bonus in an interview with Turkish newspaper Hurriet, has been promoted as part of the takeover. He remains CEO of Yemeksepeti, but will also join the executive board of Delivery Hero.
He remains convinced his team should benefit from any future successes of the firm.
"I believe in team work and I believe success is much more enjoyable and glorious when shared with the rest of the team," he said.

Radio Rookies: Reformed Catcaller Explores Roots Of Street Harassment
Growing up, Jared Marcelle watched as older men catcalled women in his Brooklyn neighborhood. He thought it was normal, so as a teenager Marcelle and his friends became those guys. But now he's changed.
ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:
Growing up, Jared Marcelle watched as older men catcalled women in his Brooklyn neighborhood. He saw and heard it so much he thought it was the norm. His assessment was right, and it remains so. A study last year by Cornell University shows that 85 percent of women in the U.S. experience street harassment before the age of 17. Well, Jared set out to understand why that is and admits that when he was a teenager, he was one of those guys.
JARED MARCELLE, BYLINE: All my life I heard girls are cats and boys are dogs...
UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Hey, gorgeous.
J. MARCELLE: ...Except that most cats don't like dogs.
UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: How are you doing, beautiful?
J. MARCELLE: And most women don't like catcalls.
UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Hey, beautiful, how are you doing?
J. MARCELLE: But that didn't stop me and my friends. Yo, Ma, psst (ph). We'd shout that out to the girls passing by. Hollering at women on the street was what guys were supposed to do, or so I thought.
What's the youngest age you've experienced this that you could remember?
ALEAH MARCELLE: I think the youngest - maybe I was 14.
J. MARCELLE: That's my younger sister Aleah. Some local construction workers said something inappropriate to her.
A. MARCELLE: I remember what I was wearing that day. I was wearing a sweater, and it was zipped up all the way. It had snowflakes on it.
J. MARCELLE: She came home flustered, and the look on her face sent me into a rage. I rushed outside ready to put hands on these fools. I made her come along with me to show her that I was top dog and she was completely safe. Then I made the group of men apologizes, but when I turned around to see if she'd accepted it, she was gone. That's when I realized I was a hypocrite.
A. MARCELLE: It's kind of ruined all men for me because obviously not all men are bad, but because any interaction I've had with a man on the street who I don't know has been a negative one, I tend to avoid every man that I see now on the street because of that.
J. MARCELLE: When I was introduced to catcalling, it was like a game, just trying to be funny or look cool. We saw older guys doing it, then started in ourselves around 13, 14. It was as easy as saying hi to your neighbor. If she looked developed, there was a comment for her. If a girl frowned across the street, it amused us. We weren't necessarily looking for a response.
MICHAEL KIMMEL: Hello.
J. MARCELLE: Hi, Mr. Kimmel.
I reached out to Michael Kimmel, a sociologist at Stony Brook University and an expert on gender studies to get his take on catcalling.
KIMMEL: It really has very little to do with the woman. It has to do with your relationship with the other guys. It's about, you know, doing it in front of other guys. You know what I mean?
J. MARCELLE: Absolutely, absolutely, and that was definitely it for me. You know, I - it never worked for me at all.
KIMMEL: Right.
J. MARCELLE: It was just about me seeking validation from my peers, which is odd when you think about it...
KIMMEL: Right.
J. MARCELLE: ...Because wouldn't you want to, you know, impress the woman, you know?
KIMMEL: Right, but the answer's no, and partly it's because we've always thought that the street is not a woman's place. It's a man's place. So it's not about making women feel good or wanted or desired. It's about making them feel, you know - feeling uncomfortable being in our space.
J. MARCELLE: Do you think that this behavior is learned, and if so, where?
KIMMEL: Well, we don't - we probably don't learn it from our moms.
J. MARCELLE: Definitely not.
KIMMEL: You learn it by standing around on a street corner with other guys, and one of them makes a comment and everyone goes, oh, you're such a player. And you say to yourself, you know, at age 6 or whatever, I want to be a player, too.
J. MARCELLE: His next comment caught me off guard.
KIMMEL: Although we think of street harassment as heterosexual, it is really what I call homosocial, which is itbeing done and performed for other guys.
J. MARCELLE: Wow, I've never thought of it that way.
But that's not the case for everybody. Sometimes guys actually want a girl's attention, so they have to change the dynamic and approach her by themselves. That's a different kind of catcaller.
SHAWN: Hey, beautiful. Damn, gorgeous, I love your hair.
J. MARCELLE: And they can be brazen about it.
SHAWN: You've got to actually approach as many females as you want until you find out which one is the one for you.
J. MARCELLE: I was talking to my friend Shawn outside my house. He's a handyman. Shawn can fix anything. He's also known for having a slick tongue, and sometimes it even works for him.
SHAWN: I still do it. I call to a girl and tell her hi, how are you doing, beautiful? I don't mean no disrespect by it.
J. MARCELLE: Have you ever stopped and thought about how women feel about it? Because apparently not every woman likes it.
SHAWN: And that's the thing. It's not that some of them don't like it. They all actually really do like it.
J. MARCELLE: All right, bro. But, you know, not all women want to be spoken to. Sometimes they just want to walk down the block and have, you know, a moment to themselves. They don't always want to talk.
SHAWN: You know, it's respect. Sometimes the guy, he's just giving you a compliment. That's all it is. Like, for example - hey, beautiful. See? I was just calling to her just to call to her. No...
J. MARCELLE: ...Just to keep your sword sharp.
SHAWN: That's it. If she says no, I'm OK with that. I can move on because guess what? There are three more girls behind her lined up.
HAAJAR: See? That mentality is what's annoying to us girls.
J. MARCELLE: That's Haajar. We've known her since she was a kid. She was passing by, and the conversation caught her ear.
This is perfect because she grew up in our neighborhood, and she has opinions as well.
Shawn tried to explain his approach to her.
SHAWN: You're walking down the street, right? A guy say hi to you, what do you say?
HAAJAR: I probably just don't answer them.
SHAWN: All right, now you answer, right? A guy say hey, beautiful, how you're doing, you turned around, oh, fine. All right, let me see where else this could go. Can I walk with you for a second?
HAAJAR: I usually say no thank you.
SHAWN: All right, now you say no thank you. The guy, he's going to look at it like, let me give it one more try. You understand?
HAAJAR: But why? Why do you need to give it one more try if I already said no thank you? Like, you couldn't take the hello, good day and my name is such and such and keep it going?
SHAWN: Yeah, but you got to understand, a female like confident dudes, period.
J. MARCELLE: So what is your response to what he just said, Haajar?
HAAJAR: I mean, I feel like we as females, or me personally, feel like I can't even be nice and say hello back to you as a courteous person because then you want to take it farther. Like, I'm sure my body language shows that I'm not interested.
J. MARCELLE: OK, so what are some things you do when you're walking down the street?
HAAJAR: If it's a group of guys, I don't feel like being annoyed, so I cross the street. I might look at my phone if I stay on that side of the street. I might have headphones in my ears with nothing playing, nothing on. I'm not listening to anything. Just when they speak to me, I can have a reason to not answer them.
J. MARCELLE: Hearing how this impacts people like Haajar and my sister allowed me to see it from a woman's perspective. As a man, I've never had to think about what women go through. I made myself think about it. I've taught myself certain things. Basically, I wrote on the chalkboard inside my mind a thousand times, women are not objects placed here for my pleasure. It was like studying for a test. And that's the hardest part. I had to write the test myself because as a guy, this doesn't really affect me, but as a human being it does.

KFDA – NewsChannel 10 / Amarillo News, Weather, Sports
Texans for Responsible Marijuana Policy met with those local advocates at the Amarillo Southwest Library Saturday afternoon to inform and discuss how to effectively get state lawmakers to decriminalize marijuana in Texas.
The group said it hopes informing citizens and lawmakers will open the doors for sensible marijuana policy discussion in the upcoming legislative races.
“Make sure that you're educated on the subject,” said Jax Finkel, the executive director of Texas NORML. “Connect with your local chapter, and connect with us if you need some resources so that we can help prepare you to go out there and have these conversations, which are very important for patients and people who are being criminalized for possession of a plant.”
“All you have to do is look to Colorado,” said Ryan Brown, a partner for Blackburn and Brown. “Short road trip away, it's been legalized for a few years now and they're making money hand over fist. The education system is better and people aren't getting locked up and wasting money on that. There's really no downsides. There's no downsides to decriminalization, only downsides for criminalization.”

Over the decades, the highway has attracted American Dreamers of various circumstances and exigencies. In the first half of the 20th century, they piled their families into jalopies to escape the Dust Bowl or to find work during the Great Depression. During World War II, soldiers followed the road in the name of service and duty. In the mid-century, liberated motorists embraced the car culture, and later the counterculture. More recently, nostalgia-seekers have boarded Route 66 to travel back in time.
This year marks two significant anniversaries: The Mother Road turns 90 and Bobby Troup's anthem, “(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66,” which Nat King Cole recorded, adds a 70th candle to its cake.
[Route 66 road trip: A real-life remix of where to ‘get your kicks']
What do you get a road that once had everything? A card and a cupcake seemed uninspired. Instead, I opted for a grander gesture: I packed up my birthday wishes and spent two weeks in July driving the route from Illinois to California. In addition, I wrote a remix of Troup's song, updating the locations in the original with towns that are more than just rhyming devices. The new destinations better represent, and honor, the Main Street of America. Because unless I needed a frozen burrito from a Shell station, I could forget Winona.
I thought I was prepared, but the road quickly dispelled my delusions.
From pre-trip research, I knew that Route 66 was not a straight line; it wriggles and curves like spiral pasta. Highway planners had realigned the road several times between 1926 and 1985, the year it was decommissioned and replaced with five interstates across eight states. Approximately 80 percent of the original road still exists, but signage is spotty. Because of its patchwork condition, I would have to flit between old and new segments, some smooth, others choppy. In addition, distances would take twice as long to cover. Or, in my case, multiply by four: For instance, it took me five hours to travel the 70 miles from Oklahoma City to the Cherokee Trading Post in Geary. The trouble started when I missed a right turn and ended up on the interstate headed eastbound, toward the morning's starting point. When I finally arrived at the Western store, I beelined for the shoe department and released my frustrations by stomping around in cowboy boots.
Aubrey de Grey has rallied the world's scientific community and its funders to attack the biological basis of aging, which underlies the majority of disease and suffering in the developed world. Since 2003, he has organized bi-annual conferences, bringing together innovative biologists, medical researchers and a few policy wonks to share knowledge and perspectives, to coordinate and support each other's efforts. Below I report highlights from this year's meeting, SENS 6, which I attended last week at Queens College, Cambridge.
Caloric Restriction in Monkeys – Reconciling Two Studies
This year and last year, two parallel studies of caloric restriction in rhesus monkeys reported their results. Science reporters framed their conclusions as contradictory. In Madison, the CR monkeys lived longer, while in Baltimore, they did not. Both studies reported robust benefits for many aspects of health in the CR monkeys. What I learned last week was that the Baltimore monkeys had a much leaner diet than the Madison monkeys. In fact, the control monkeys in Baltimore – those that were supposed to be “fully-fed” – got about as many calories per day as the CR monkeys in Madison. A natural interpretation of the two results is that modest CR extends life span but that severe CR doesn't extend life span further (though it may improve health and lower rates of cancer and heart disease). Read more
Another interesting subplot: the Madison diet formula was both high-fat and high-glycemic index, while lower in protein than the Baltimore formula. The Madison diet was completely synthetic (so it could be precisely controlled) including 28% sucrose. The Baltimore diet was based on whole grains and fish meal, with the rationale that there are micronutrients in whole foods that may be important though we have not yet catalogued them. When two groups of mice were fed on these two formulas, adjusted to the same number of calories, the ones on the Madison diet gained weight while those on the Baltimore diet did not. This echoes a theme that is reported in Scientific American this month: the body's caloric budget is not the primary determinant of obesity. The same number of calories from different sources can have dramatically different effects on metabolism. I'll write more on this next week.
Exercise vs Caloric Restriction
For the last ten yeas, Luigi Fontana of Washington University St Louis has been conducting an ongoing study of two groups of people who exercise fanatically (by middle-class US standards) and who seriously restrict their food intake (same standard). Both groups have dramatically improved biomarkers compared to the average American couch potato. There are some differences between the two. Exercise seems to be better for lowering markers of insulin resistance – the “metabolic syndrome” or “Type 2 Diabetes” that underlies the diseases of old age. Diet works better to lower cardiovascular risk factors. Both work to lower indicators of cancer risk. (It will be many years before there is data to evaluate the effect of CR on human mortality.)

An aging clock in the brain
Dongsheng Cai of Einstein Medical Center in New York reported that age-related inflammation is especially prominent in a region of the brain called the hypothalamus, which is known to regulate body rhythms. The hypothalamus is especially sensitive to a signal hormone called NFkB that has damaging effects over the whole body. In experiments with flies and mice, life span can be extended by blocking the action of NFkB. Read more
Spermidine
Frank Madeo of University of Graz in Austria reported on experiments with a small molecule called spermidine. Fed to yeast cells, it increases life span dramatically, with smaller but still significant effects in flies and worms. Life span of mice can be increased by about 10% with spermidine in the diet. The mechanism seems to be stimulation of the process called autophagy, by which each cell cleans up its waste products, digesting them in organelles called lysosomes. Spermidine is part of the body's metabolism, but its concentration declines with age. It is not available as a supplement, to my knowledge. The best dietary source is a Japanese fermented soy product called natto, which is famous for its vile flavor. Other dietary sources include soy products and wheat germ. And yes, it is found at high concentrations in semen. Read more
Alternative to Chemotherapy and Radiation
Dr M Rigdon Lentz (an American) runs a German clinic with a unique cancer treatment. Cancer cells protect themselves from attack by the body's immune system by spitting out many “false target” molecules that attract killer T cells in the blood and distract them from the real culprit, the cancer cells themselves. Lentz's procedure involves filtering these decoy molecules from the blood. Often this is sufficient to initiate a fierce immune assault on the tumors, which flare up hot and red. Lentz described some dramatic cures. He reports major regression of tumors in 70% of his patients, despite the fact that most of them have been treated previously with chemo and/or radiation and traditional oncology has given up on them.

DRACO – kills all virus-infected cells
Todd Rider of MIT is quietly witty on-stage and charmingly self-effacing, but his program is radically ambitious. He wants to cure all infectious disease.
DRACO is an acronym for Double-stranded RNA-Activated Caspase Oligomizer. Start with the observation that single strands of RNA are used in all cells, but double-stranded RNA is found only in cells infected by viruses. The DrACO molecule has three parts: One part speaks to the body's “mail system” that looks at address tags on a molecule, and uses those to send them to a particular cell. DRACO molecules are targeted to a particular kind of cell that is infected. Part two is a detector of double-stranded RNA. And if dsRNA is found, then part three is activated: molecular signals that trigger cell death. The bottom line is that DRACO molecules can find cells that are infected with any virus, distinguish them from uninfected cells, and selectively signal the cell to destroy itself. It's been tested in test tubes and in mice it cures, for example, the flu. Rider's lab is producing only tiny quantities of DRACO at present, but by year's end he hopes to ramp up production for much wider testing. Read more
RTEs = Retro Transposable Elements
Half of our DNA consists of repetitious stretches of DNA that never get translated into proteins. This was once referred to as “junk DNA” or even “parasitic DNA”, but it probably plays an important role in evolution. One piece of evidence for this is that RTEs of recent origin (those unique to primates) are a lot more active and mobile. They're the part of us that is presently evolving. John Sedivy of Brown University reported that senescent cells – cells that have depleted their telomeres – are far more likely to have active RTE's. These DNA segments make RNA copies of themselves which can then be “retro-transcribed” back into the chromosome, with disruptive consequences. (Transcription = DNA→RNA, part of the path by which chromosomes control the cell; Retro-transcription = RNA→DNA, an unusual and often pathological process) Read more
Retinoic Acid promotes regeneration of damaged tissue
Retinoic Acid is an ingredient in prescription cremes which treat acne and also aging skin. Malcolm Maden from University of Florida reported that retinoic acid promotes regeneration generally. Read more
Genetic therapy is much advanced
Frank Church of Harvard reported on the state of the art in gene therapy. Fourteen years ago, the first gene transplant experiments resulted in death of a (very sick) teen patient, and set the field back several years. But advances in the interim make it possible now to insert a gene safely into a large number of cells of a lilving body, and target them to a precisely specified position on a chosen chromosome. This is done using CRISPRs, which are short stretches of RNA with a distinctive palindromic pattern, used by viruses to find the right place to insert themselves into a host genome.

Plasticity of the brain
Jean Hébert of Einstein Medical Center in New York is working to inject neural stem cells into the brain, to grow new nerves. This might seem like an impossible challenge. Nerve cells regenerate at a rate lower than any other cell type in the body, and even if we got them to regrow, how would they come to carry the knowledge and skills that we have acquired during a lifetime? Hébert reports a hopeful and amazing fact: In patients with brain tumors that destroy function in one part of the brain, another part picks up the function smoothly and without noticeable disruption. This has been noted with fMRI studies based on Boca's area, which houses language. Read more
Growing a liver on a lymph node
There is a long waiting list for liver transplants. In the US, 90% of patients with liver failure will die before they get a transplant. Some have proposed transplanting livers from pigs. Eric Lagasse of Wake Forest Inst for regenerative medicine has another idea. He has had success growing new livers from stem cells in the patient's body. Liver progenitor cells are implanted in a lymph node, which seems to provide a favorable environment for growth. In mouse models, 70% are able to grow a functional liver “ectopically”, meaning in a part of the body where it does not belong.

Occupy Wall Street: Promoting Credit Unions
At Occupy Wall Street's headquarters in Liberty Plaza , New York City, teach-ins happen daily over the People's Mic (an empowering, participatory spectacle, shown here). Lecture topics vary widely, including the prison-industrial complex, land grabs in Brazil, gender equality, philosophy, environmental issues, and lots and lots of economics. Joseph Stiglitz, Jeff Madrick, Brian Holmes, and Richard D. Wolff are just four of the many one can find down in the park, discussing complex economic issues with an audience ready to learn. Slavoj Zizek, Eve Ensler, Cornel West, and Judith Butler have also made appearances. The list of renowned thinkers willing to teach (and to listen) down at OWS is long and impressive.
Right now, Occupy Wall Street is the best place to find an education. As Wolff proclaimed at the beginning of one of his teach-ins: "This is the best classroom I could imagine, and the reason is simple: because I am teaching people ready to act on what they learn and who are not afraid to take new directions in a country that desperately needs it."
Below are the lecture notes from Elizabeth Friedrich (bio below), who, on October 25, taught the assembled crowd about credit unions, which are alternative institutions to big banks. There is a growing movement coming out of and working parallel with the OWS movement to move money out of giant financial institutions and into small, local credit unions. Bank Transfer Day, for example, calls for this monetary shift to occur before November 5th.
To learn more about credit unions, visit the National Federation of Community Development Credit Unions, the Credit Union National Association, NYCfNAC, and findacreditunion.com.
*
Hi. My name is Elizabeth Friedrich and I work for the National Federation of Community Development Credit Unions; however, these views are my own.
In 2008, we were in Shock. We saw the stock market crash, the housing market collapse, and the bailout. We were paralyzed.
We did not know what would happen next and hoped for the best.
Today, we have more perspective. We understand that the choices of a few have had negative impacts on the many. We understand now more than ever, that there is no invisible hand guiding the capital markets … We also know the markets need to be well regulated.
Today we have a choice. There is a parallel financial industry functioning alongside banks -Credit Unions. Credit Unions offer many of the same services as banks but with affordable and flexible terms. Accounts at both banks and credit unions are insured up to $250,000.
BUT!!!
There are three very important differences:
+ Credit Unions serve their local communities. This means that the money deposited by members, stays locally, to help build a stronger community.
+ Member Satisfaction is primary. A Credit Union's top priority is their members. With Commercial Banks, customer satisfaction is secondary.
+ Credit Unions are democratically governed; every member has an equal vote. Members elect their board of directors, and the boards are not compensated.
Credit unions have been around for more than 100 years; they are unique depository institutions created not for profit, but to serve their members' financial needs. They are accountable to all of their members, not to a limited number of owners.
There are over 80 credit unions serving different types of membership across New York City. There are 440 Credit Unions in New York State and 7,500 nationwide, with over 90 million members. Many provide their members with access to extensive surcharge-free ATM networks. Membership is based on your location, association, and/or employer, but there is some flexibility.
There ARE alternatives based on the principles of people before profit and economic democracy. It's your choice. Understanding your options is the first step towards financial stability and change. Let this movement be a model for the country and the world to see what cooperation and motivation can do.
November 5th is Bank Transfer Day. Find out more about Credit Unions. The Alternative Economics Working Group will be setting up a table this week in Zuccotti Park. We will have a list of credit unions and step-by-step guide to join one. You can also go on findacreditunion.com.

I'm posting about the artwork again to follow-up on the contest and the desktop backgrounds for Linux Mint 9.
Wallpapers included by default:
The following wallpapers will be included by default in Linux Mint 9 (click on the pictures to see them in full size).
From “29A”:
From “Talento Design”:
From “At your service”:
From “96works”:
From the Linux Mint community, (from left to right: “Emotion” from distro hopper, “AirMint” from dkreations and “LM9” from Zwopper):
Note: “LM9” from Zwopper will come without the label shown on the above picture.
Note: If space doesn't allow it, some backgrounds could be removed. The pictures which are sure to be included by default are marked with a thick border.
The default background:
At the moment, the default background is the one from “Talento Design” (first one below). Alternative choices include a design from “96works” and “AirMint” from dlkreations. See below:
Poll: I can't promise I'll follow the majority vote, as always I'll do what I think is best but I'm interested to know your thoughts on this.
[poll:12]
Other backgrounds:
A number of packages will appear in Linux Mint 9:
“mint-wallpapers-extra” will contain many wallpapers made for Linux Mint 9 which weren't installed by default, unbranded versions of 96works' artwork, variations from Talento Design and At your service, and a few others.
“mint-wallpapers-previous-releases” will contain the wallpapers used by past releases, such as the very popular “Dew” used in Linux Mint 7 Gloria, and the black wallpapers used in Linux Mint 3, 4, 5, 6..
“mint-wallpapers-source” will contain the .PSD, .XCF, .SVG sources of the wallpapers and also the Linux Mint logos. We bought the copyrights on the artwork from 29A, At your service, Talento Design and 96works and we're freeing it all for everyone to use. This package will give artists in our community great resources to start from, to modify and to reuse for their own creations.
We'll also probably include a community package which will grow bigger as the community adds to it, but this is likely to happen after the release of Linux Mint 9.
Blue, green, black:
Many of the backgrounds shown above are also available in blue and will be featured in the KDE edition of Linux Mint 9.
The plan to design a metal-looking theme was postponed to Linux Mint 10. Black backgrounds are likely to come back into fashion at that stage. At the moment, we're using a black panel and so we're happy to stick to green for the background (as you can see there's a lot of green in the pictures shown above).
Focus and efforts:
We're working really hard on the upcoming release. We've looked at a lot of things, we've made many improvements and there's been a huge amount of coding done for Linux Mint 9. I've no doubt people will be pleased with the release as we've significantly made things better. I know some people are upset when we talk about artwork, either they don't see the importance of it when it comes to users' first impression, or they think that the time we put into this is time taken away from more important things. This is the icing on the cake, something that comes very late in the release cycle… something which priority was low but which is extremely important to us as we're getting ready to release. Attention to details is something we can't oversee. When it comes to look & feel, things are so subjective and trends change so fast that it's easy for us to make a mistake, but we'll spend a few days at the end of each release cycle, like we're doing right now, and whether we get it right or not, we'll try our best to relax and to put efforts in making Linux Mint look the best we can.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Repealing the U.S. healthcare law enacted last year would add $210 billion to the nation's deficit over the next decade, congressional auditors said on Friday.
The Congressional Budget Office said enactment of a House of Representatives measure last month to scrap the healthcare overhaul would eliminate a number of provisions aimed at reducing federal healthcare costs as well as strip out new revenue-creating taxes and fees.
Republicans, who now control the House, campaigned on repealing the law, one of Democratic President Barack Obama's main legislative victories. Despite the vote in the House, the repeal was largely symbolic as neither the Democratic-led Senate nor Obama support it.
The CBO, along with the Joint Committee on Taxation, earlier estimated the law would save the federal government $124 billion between 2010, when the law was passed, and 2019. Its $210 billion cost increase estimate on Friday covers a slightly different period — 2012 to 2021.
The agency, which analyzes the costs of various legislation for U.S. lawmakers, said the main difference in the two estimates was mainly because they cover different 10-year periods.
But looking at just the eight years in common between both estimates, implementing the law would save the government $132 billion, while repealing it would boost deficits by $119 billion, it said.
The CBO's analysis comes as U.S. House lawmakers passed an amendment to a spending bill on Friday that would block funds needed to implement the 2010 law, one of Obama's top domestic priorities.
Passed last March, the measure aims to help roughly 30 million Americans gain access to health insurance while enacting numerous other consumer protections.
While expanding coverage was estimated to increase the deficit, such costs were offset by provisions that curb federal spending on items such as private Medicare plans, the CBO said. Additional fees and taxes such as those imposed on health insurers and drugmakers also helped offset the law's costs, it said.
I was the IT person for a manufacturing company during the Y2K switch. One of the business managers' favorite mantras was that everything had to ultimately be "flexible," and any rule could be broken if the situation demanded it. Where inventory was concerned, they were constantly robbing Peter to ship to Paul, and then wondering why their shipment to Peter had so many back-ordered items. This became my problem when I was tasked with creating inventory tracking software.
We had just chosen an ERP to replace some non-Y2k-compliant systems. The ERP implementation was slated to take two years. However, the inventory problems were serious enough that management wanted me to replace our existing workflow (paper-based data that was keyed into our legacy manufacturing system) with an electronic system right away. They wanted inventory movement handled by RF barcode scanners, and I was told to come up with a solution. I went with the ERP's preferred data collection partner.

I designed the system so the interface on the RF scanners would be the same regardless of the back end. Until the ERP arrived, I had to interface the inventory movement to the legacy manufacturing system, hosted on a nonstandard obsolete platform that had been deprecated by the manufacturer.
The system worked well enough: Our inventory was the most accurate it had ever been (which still isn't saying much). We gave the warehouse staff a thorough tutorial on how to use the RF scanner and track the inventory. However, we were still plagued with inventory losses.
When the new data collection system had been in place for a little over a year, quarterly financials showed that we were on track to lose over $8 million. Focus quickly turned to inventory problems and my inventory movement system. To combat the ever-increasing scrutiny, I designed a test of the system to show once and for all that the inventory system worked.
The plan was that we would run a program that would "move" every item of inventory to a dummy location called "Foo." Then, on a Sunday when the factory was down, an army of people using the inventory guns would manually count and scan everything from location Foo back to their true location.
The first benefit was that our inventory would then be correct -- all errors would be in Foo. The second benefit was that we would be running a huge amount of data through the system, proving its stability or exposing any weaknesses.

To get things started, here is a bit from the programme:
Fairfield struggles to cope after threefold increase in refugee arrivals
Updated
Fairfield in Western Sydney is struggling to resettle refugees after a huge influx of new arrivals, mostly from Iraq and Syria.
Over 3,000 refugees were resettled in Fairfield in 2016 — three times more than the local government area typically accepts in a year.
Fairfield is tipped to take in roughly half of Australia's special intake of Syrian and Iraqi refugees, granted asylum under the Federal Government's special humanitarian intake.
Local government officials said a recent briefing indicated the trend was unlikely to slow anytime soon, because of the need for humanitarian asylum.
Aida Kerfarkes, her husband Antoun Abdal and their four children arrived in Fairfield seven months ago.
Ms Kerfarkes said they had a good life before the conflict; their eldest son was about to graduate from medical school, and their eldest daughter was just two years away from becoming a pharmacist.
She now has hope for their future in Australia.
"We knew when we got here that this was the place we were going to call home and this was going to be our country," Ms Kerfarkes said.
"Therefore, sitting at home waiting for things to happen wasn't going to make us fit in.
"We decided English is the top of our priority, but also any settlement services available to us we would attend to learn more about this country."
The family are Assyrian, a persecuted Christian minority which has been targeted by the so-called Islamic State.
Their village came under sustained attack and one of their daughters was lucky to survive one of many bombings.
Eventually, they were forced to flee their home and were granted asylum in Australia.
Mr Abdal said it was a confronting time, and the fear of the unknown was very real.
"The feeling was really overwhelming. It was going into a life that we didn't know what to expect," he said.
"It was really sad to be leaving our country because we loved our country.
"I remember being on the aeroplane [to Australia] and thinking 'where are we going? This long 24-hour plane ride!'
"I just kept looking at my wife and my kids and I couldn't stop the tears coming down my face because I didn't know what I was going into."
Ms Kerfarkes and Mr Abdal said they had been overwhelmed by the support they had received since arriving in Australia.
They said they were looking forward to being able to give back to the country that provided them with safety.
'The pressure is on'
Deena Yako is a community development worker at the Parents Cafe Fairfield, which provides assistance to adult refugees, mostly through social outings.
"Fairfield is known to be a community hub, a refugee community hub that does settlement really well," Ms Yako said.
"It has put a bit of pressure on the local schools, local community organisations."
Ms Yako said some outlets were stretched.
"Especially for the smaller not-for-profit organisations that rely on one to two workers," she said.
"There's been a great amount of ethno-specific organisations and religious organisations that have come on board and have been wanting to help and assist.
"The pressure is on."
Fairfield City Mayor Frank Carbone has written to Immigration Minister Peter Dutton to call for more money for refugee resettlement services.
He said a more localised approach was needed, as community groups and services struggled to cope.
"I think that the funding could either be increased or better allocated — it could be put in place in a localised area rather than a regional one, so that it can have a better impact if you will.
"There is a recognition now that a large proportion of refugees are resettling in the Fairfield local government area. It is very difficult when you first arrive, with housing, English language learning and employment services all needed."
He said that many service providers funded by the Federal Government were not located in the actual Fairfield local area.
"While Liverpool or Bankstown might be reasonably close, it is too far for locals struggling to integrate into the Australian system," he said.
"I don't believe the funding is being used as wisely as possible. We have great local service providers, they know how to resettle people. Let them do their work."
Fairfield council is currently working to develop a plan to deal with the surge in new arrivals and anticipates it will be finalised by March.
They hope government assistance will be forthcoming to help ease pressure.

“Do the people think that they will be left to say, “We believe” and they will not be tried?” (The Noble Quran 29:2)
Assalamu'alaikum,
My first reaction to this deceitful ‘Hamas on campus' video was pure and utter disgust followed by horror. I immediately felt very small and vulnerable, as if someone had just put me in the hot seat. It is unsettling to think that a worldwide platform like YouTube is broadcasting such hateful nonsense.
How can someone compare a monstrous group like ISIS to a community of post secondary Muslim students (specifically the Muslim Student Association or MSA) who are just trying to find a family of friends where they can find support? How can someone even say that a group like ISIS is a Muslim “brotherhood”? If most people accepted that that the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) isn't really a Christian organization then why can't they see that ISIS is in no way a Muslim group? Personally, I can hardly believe that both are even considered human.
Have we ever asked ourselves what it means to be Muslim? What makes us different? Obviously, there are some fundamental differences, such as prayer for example, but in essence: what is a Muslim? Simply, to be human is to have desires or wants and to be Muslim is to control them. Consider this, if these “people” cannot control their hands when dealing with people that they do not like or agree with, if they cannot control their tongues or their misdirected anger, then how are they Muslim? When they stop to pray and all make sujood (bow) in different directions, how can they be called Muslim? Why don't we question the media, why aren't we using our intellects, why do we just mindlessly allow the media to spoon-feed us this sort of blatant and shameless propaganda? Islam is for the thinking person, we are taught to question and to strive for knowledge and truth as it should be our constant and lifelong pursuit.
“They have taken their oaths as a cover, so they averted [people] from the way of Allah. Indeed, it was evil that they were doing.” (The Noble Quran 63:2)
There is an inexplicable amount of worry in my heart for my fellow peers, especially Muslim brothers and sisters who are actively participating in groups like MSA. After witnessing the loss of fellow MSA members who were martyred in the Chapel Hill shooting, the unease has only grown. Martyrs, because these dedicated individuals were far more compassionate and faithful than the average young adult as selfless and active members in their community, Muslim and Non-Muslim. They were charitable leaders and they were striving in the name of Allah in order to bring relief to suffering parts of the Ummah. They were brutally targeted in spite, because of their modesty, their patience in the face of abuse and outstanding work. Though it is incredibly heart wrenching, deep in my heart I feel joy for them, because they are the lucky ones. They died in the cause of Allah. Subhan'Allah, Allah granted them an honorable departure. May Allah continue to reward them in this life and in the next by granting them Janaat-ul-Firdous, Ameen. You may wonder why I mention them, but you see those three could have been anyone…it could have been you or me.
“And do not say of those who are slain in the way of Allah that they are dead. Instead, they are alive, but you perceive not.” (The Noble Quran 2:154)
Recently, we have had police officers attending MSA meetings and events, not only at my university, but universities everywhere have been experiencing this haunting presence over their shoulders. We've been stripped of our right to have a safe place where we belong. After a long stressful day, sometimes all you need is to surround yourself with believers and let them hold you together and strengthen your Imaan (faith). Are we not even allowed that solace anymore? I feel robbed of my right to belong and it is terrifying. Individual students are being called out; they are being investigated and have the police at their doorsteps questioning them and their families. I am so saddened to see my fellow brothers and sisters disappearing from the meditation rooms and the MSA events out of fear. It breaks my heart to see us being torn apart by hatred and ignorance. I am disheartened that when attending a secular institution the only place where we feel accepted may now be the reason our rights and lives are at risk.
“And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided. And remember the favor of Allah upon you.” (The Noble Quran 3:103)
The only piece of advice I can give my fellow students and MSA members is that no matter what hold on tightly to each other and surround yourselves with believers. Surround yourselves with the people who remind you of Allah SWT and don't allow that bond to be so easily severed. If there is anything I have learned from Deah, Yusor and Razan (Chapel Hill Martyrs) it is that as long as I stay true to Allah and keep striving in His cause, He will reward me both in this life and the next, I just may not know it yet. Even though their death was tragic their life is celebrated, because they always remained united, stayed true to their beliefs and continued to struggle towards peace in helping their community and the Ummah however they could. This was their jihad and they embraced it so beautifully. Wallahi, I have tears in my eyes as I write this, because I am truly happy for them. I hope that we all can learn from them and continue in our struggle, our struggle against ourselves and to stay together as an Ummah. There is no healing anywhere else except with Allah and who better to guide us than our believing brothers and sisters.
“And He found you lost and guided you…” (The Noble Quran 93:7)
It may seem difficult right now, in fact it may seem downright impossible, but Allah promises that He is All Knowing and All Seeing. Every tear you shed is noticed, every pain you suffer is acknowledged and you are not alone. He is with us, nothing is impossible for Him and we must trust in Him. May Allah make this easy for us and grant us the most excellent rewards for our struggle, may He give the families of not only the Chapel Hill victims, but all others who have suffered and lost loved ones as they strived in the cause of Allah, Ameen.
“The believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger then they doubt not and struggle hard with their wealth and their lives in the way of Allah; they are the truthful ones.” (The Noble Quran 49:15)
Unity in the Face of Adversity – Solace for Muslim Students Rate this post Rate this post

Since the day it was announced that Loretta Fuddy, the Director of the Hawaii Department of Health who verified Obama's birth certificate died mysteriously in a plane crash, there was some question of whether is been really an “accident”. The authorities seem to be saying, yes. But, because of her close ties to the fraudulent Obama Birth Certificate, many people fear that she was the most recent in Obama's “dead pool” and haven't stopped looking for real answers. It seems that amateur bloggers and Youtubers are the new Investigative Journalists in this new media society of “give the President a pass, or be a racist”.
I recently came across a video and still photos that were meticulously retrieved by a fellow blogger, from the Ferdinand Puentes GoCam videos that he took of the plane crash on December 11, 2013 in which Loretta Fuddy died. The photos can be found here: http://butterdezillion.wordpress.com/2014/02/13/extras/ . She has more shots there than I am showing, so check it out. Many thanks – great work!
The Puentes video originally aired on ABC in January 2014 and can be seen here. http://abcnews.go.com/US/harrowing-video-hawaiian-plane-crash-inside-cabin/story?id=21484715 The segment depicted below is at about 3:33 minutes in the video and lasts about 3 seconds. There has been a lot of speculation about this “accident”, as so many things just don't add up. The story of a tragic death was reported before rescuers had even gotten to the plane. First reports indicated someone remained in the plane, when in fact, all got out. And the only death was the one person who really might know the truth about Obama's birth certificate. It took a month for vague autopsy results. The local police and the NTSB couldn't decide who was in charge of the investigation into her death.
Dr. Fuddys death was declared to be from a problem with her heart – natural causes, and we're all supposed to believe that it was all just a tragic accident, but after seeing these photos, all doubt is gone. As I looked through the still shots taken from the video, my blood froze, because I knew what I was seeing. I am seeing a diver do something to Loretta Fuddy, which I assume was murder, and it chills me to the bone. I hope that law enforcement can be made aware of what seems to be shown in these pictures, so they can investigate it. Just look, please. Form your own opinion.
The first photos are reference photos of what I think you'll be able to see in the actual photos. (they are NOT actual photos of the divers in the video- the shoe is really Dr. Fuddy's)
THE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE
The photos below are in sequence. The ones on the left are the originals – to the right I have highlighted what I see. Beyond frightening. This whole video sequence takes about 3 seconds in real time.The series of photos shown below are the actual stills of the events that are shown on Ferdinand Puentes video. http://abcnews.go.com/US/harrowing-video-hawaiian-plane-crash-inside-cabin/story?id=21484715 These photos have been zoomed and cropped by Butterdezillion. In the GoPro video, the action is actually quite a distance away. You can click on any set to enlarge them to see better.
Start with Picture #1, and follow the sequence like a movie. I have labeled people and things on the right hand picture. This is Loretta Fuddy on the right and Keith Yamamoto on the left. He is looking at her. She is laying back into her flotation device. Her head is just visible and one shoe is visible. The shoe is important – and remember, all of this takes 3 seconds in real time.
So, there you have it. Loretta Fuddy is floating in her life jacket holding hands with her Assistant, Keith Yamamoto. A diver completely dressed in black surfaces momentarily for about 3 seconds and seems to be doing something to her foot or leg. My theory is that he administered some type of injection that ultimately caused Dr. Fuddy's death. The lets go and vanishes. The plan was not to be seen, but she may have felt something and pulled her foot away, and he had no choice but to surface to get to the foot. I have no idea why that would be so important, unless they felt that a medical examiner is less likely to see an injection site on a foot or ankle.
Others seem to think that what I see as a foot is a second diver, because Loretta Fuddy was wearing “Black shoes”. As we see from the top reference pictures, the shoes had a tan or beige sole, which with the lighting could easily brighten to light yellow. Look at the head of the man in the foreground – he's yellow, too. Also, the GoPro cameras have a slight fish-eye effect, due to the wide angle lense. It gives a convex appearance – where objects in the middle appear closer than objects on the sides, and distances are different, too – depending on where they are in the lense. As we know the plane sank within 25 minutes, and it is still visible in the video, there are NOT rescue divers. The two hands holding the foot in picture #5 are what makes me sure of what I'm seeing.
Picture # 5 shows two hands holding the yellow shoe, # 6 shows both hands releasing the shoe.
Even if I'm wrong about the shoe – this IS A DIVER who shouldn't be there and is clearly up to no good. Whatever this is – it is frightening. I hope that the right people are made aware of this and that it can be followed up on appropriately.
FYI -this pictures terrifies me. What kind of world do we live in? The further implication to this photo is that this was a STAGED accident. It is no coincidence that a plane lost it's engine within swimming distance of two divers/assassins. We also then have to wonder if the pilot was in on it, unless the divers were ON THE PLANE and the engine was sabotaged. Either way, someone planned this, and Dr. Fuddy is dead.
Obama vacationed in Hawaii 10 days later. Had Dr. Fuddy indicated to the wrong people that she would like to “talk” to him about “things” i.e the fraudulent birth certificate she personally signed off on? Step up law enforcement and main stream media, before it's too late for all of us, too.

PARMA, Ohio - Investigators have released audio of a hoax 911 call in which a man told police that he shot his father and was holding his mother and sister hostage.
The man called police at 8:20 p.m. and told a dispatcher that he was holding his family members hostage at a home in the 3100 block of West Ridgewood Drive. Parma officers and the department's SWAT team surrounded the home but discovered that the call was a hoax, Lt. Kevin Riley said.
"I just shot my dad in the stomach with a 12-gauge shotgun," the man said during the call. "He's in the bathroom right now. My mom's in the bathroom and so is my sister. They're all tied up."
Investigators released audio of the call Monday and are asking the public to help identify the caller, Riley said.
Parma hostage hoax 911 call
The caller told the dispatcher that he would shoot officers who arrived at the home. He also threatened to shoot his mother and sister.
Officers made contact with a 58-year-old man and 55-year-old woman who were inside the home and instructed them to walk outside. Investigators searched the home and several nearby homes to confirm the call was a hoax.
The caller hung up when the man and the woman walked outside, police said.
Investigators believe the incident was an example of a trend called "swatting," which involves reporting life-threatening emergencies in the hopes of bringing in a SWAT team and a large contingent of first responders.
"This is not just a prank. It's a very dangerous situation," Riley said. "We're taking this as a very serious matter, and we're going to make every effort to identify the caller and prosecute to the fullest extent."
Anyone with information about the caller is being asked to contact the Parma Police Crime Tip Line at 440-887-7340.
An edited version of the call is included in this post. The audio has been edited to remove the address of the West Ridgewood Drive home.
Four suspects — including three juveniles — arrested over the holiday weekend in DeKalb County may be linked to the crime wave that has plagued East Atlanta throughout the summer, police say.
DeKalb police spokesman William Wallace confirmed the four male youths — the oldest is 18 — were arrested on July 4 and charged with burglary and theft by receiving.
Officers recovered two stolen cars and discovered stolen guns, electronic equipment and checkbooks inside the apartment of one of the suspects.
Wallace said “evidence connecting them to additional crimes was obtained. At this stage in the investigation we are unable to advise if these suspects are connected to or solely responsible for” some of the high-profile crimes in East Atlanta.
Police have already linked a number of the crimes in East Atlanta — namely the fatal shooting of Patrick Cotrona over the Memorial Day weekend and a pair of armed robberies that occurred earlier that same night.
The suspect in those incidents was described by witnesses as males between the ages of 16 and 18. The perpetrators in many of the other crimes in the area have routinely been males in their mid-to-late-teens, say police
A victim robbed by three suspects — two of whom were alleged to be toting assault weapons — as he walked home from a bar in East Atlanta Village early Sunday morning said he didn't get a good look at the robbers. But the brazen nature of the crime is in line with many of the others seen in recent months.
“DeKalb made some significant arrests on the Fourth of July,” Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Renee Propes told Channel 2 Action News. “We believe they may be related to some of the crimes here in Zone 6 because we know perpetrators don't know borders. They don't care. They go back and forth between zones, between jurisdictions.”
The net may grow even wider, as Decatur police said last week they are working with their counterparts in Atlanta and DeKalb in hopes of catching the suspects responsible for an uptick in burglaries and robberies there — many of them occurring in the daytime. Last week three women were robbed at gunpoint at Oakhurst Park while another was carjacked in downtown Decatur.
Decatur's police chief was to meet with neighborhood groups Monday and Tuesday, while residents of East Atlanta, Grant Park, Peoplestown, Kirkwood, Chosewood Park and other local communities have scheduled a joint meeting on Wednesday to discuss the ongoing crime wave.
“It's frustrating,” said Kate Krumm, sister of Cotrona. There have been no arrests in the fatal shooting of the 33-year-old video game engineer. “The crime keeps happening.
“If it didn't take the murder of an innocent person to make things change, what's it going to take?” she said.
A transgender psychologist who specializes in LGBT issues has been jailed for harassing a female patient for five months.
Dr Kyle Mancuso, who is also known as Lisa, was sentenced to six months in prison for his bizarre behavior towards Felicia Martin in Houston, Texas - and prosecutors believe more of his clients could also have been victims.
Martin came forward and revealed that Mancuso sent her a barrage of strange text messages and delusional voicemail messages when she stopped her therapy sessions last year.

Jailed: Dr Kyle Mancuso, who is also known as Lisa, was sentenced to six months in prison for his bizarre behavior towards former patient Felicia Martin in Houston, Texas
She shared her harrowing story in a bid to get other potential victims, who may be too scared to speak out, to contact the police.
His behavior escalated when he arrived at her office and gave her a book containing poems, messages and Dr Seuss cartoons he had scribbled in crayon.
Martin told ABC 13 Houston: 'Showing up at your place of work, making threatening phone calls. How horrifying that can be.
'Two weeks after I terminated the working relationship I started to receive voicemails at about 5am that were nonsensical and delusional.
She added: 'He escalated. It was frightening to me and my family.'
Last week, Mancuso was convicted, and sentenced to 180 days in jail and a $2000 fine.
Prosecutor Britney Jackson told the station: 'It speaks to the harm he did to someone who was vulnerable, and that's why we know for fact there are more people.'
Martin is now appealing to the state licensing board to get Mancuso's license to practice revoked.

Family Sues After Govt Took Little Boy, Multiple Agencies Allowed Him To Be Tortured For Years
Loading ... Loading ...
For several years, state agencies documented the horrifying torture and abuse of Andrian Jones and did nothing, according to a lawsuit.
(TFTP) Kansas City, MO — The family of the late Adrian Jones has filed a lawsuit against the state of Kansas, the state's Department for Children and Families and several others, for the horrifying murder of this innocent young boy.
In 2011, Adrian was taken from his mother by DCF over claims that she wasn't able to properly supervise her child. It is a matter of court record, according to the suit, that Adrian was in perfect health when he was taken by the state. However, all that would quickly change.
As the court records show, “this wrongful death lawsuit involves the grotesque circumstances surrounding the tragically short and brutish life of A.J., a little boy who died a horrific, unimaginably gruesome death at the hands of his father and stepmother, an entirely avoidable child-homicide.”
Within just a few months of DCF taking Adrian and placing him in the care of his stepmother—who was observed caring for the child while high on drugs—and admittedly abusive father, the reports of injuries began pouring in.
The first reports were of Adrian's sibling who suffered internal bleeding and extensive bruising all over his body. In spite of the medical provider explicitly noting that these injuries did not fit the description Adrian's father gave of the child falling down stairs, DCF failed to act.
A few weeks later, another hotline call would be placed to DCF in which Adrian's father admitted Adrian “busted his head open.” Again, no action.
During the inquiry into a third hotline call, the stepmother admitted that the father abuses the children and her. Police also recorded Adrian having a black eye, and the stepmother admitted that she heard ‘choking noises' when the father would take Adrian to the bathroom. Again, no action.
“A.J.'s mistreatment was the repeated subject of a seemingly endless series of reports and hotline calls to social workers and social service agencies in both Missouri and Kansas,” the lawsuit states. “KsDCF conducted a forensic interview of A.J.'s siblings, who disclosed Father hits the children on the head, Father puts the children in a corner and hits the legs, stomach, and hands, Father's hands were red after he hit the children, and Stepmother kicked A.J. with a boot, hit A.J. in the head with toys and other objects.”
In spite of the mountain of evidence showing an ongoing pattern of horrific child abuse, DCF failed to act on multiple occasions. Instead, they made the father sign a document in which he promised to not abuse his son. According to the lawsuit, this amounted to little more than a “pinky promise” with a monster.
“But instead of responding by permanently removing the child from his home, the agencies and social workers took a strangely different approach: They meticulously investigated and carefully documented every violent kick, punch, slap, and injury inflicted upon A.J. by his sadistic father and stepmother, and generated stacks of records and reports chronicling the ceaseless, stomach-churning abuse. But their idea of intervention was limited, almost exclusively, to having A.J.'s father and stepmother sign a piece of paper agreeing to stop torturing the child – the legal equivalent of a “pinky swear.” As it turned out, that signed paper might as well have been A.J.'s death warrant,” the lawsuit states.
In 2012, the father and stepmother moved to Missouri. For nearly two more years, Missouri social workers documented similar abuse. However, one social worker, Rebecca Caldwell, named in the suit, wrote off Adrian's bruises as ‘dirt'—in spite of the fact that Adrian reported the abuse.
Just like their counterparts in Kansas, the Missouri Department of Social Services also took no action.
In 2014, another social worker, Amanda Donnelly, named in the suit, documented marks on Adrian's body and noted how Adrian told her his dad would tape his arms and legs as punishment. Donnelly, like the social workers and police before her, did not act.
Months later, Adrian was sent to various mental hospitals. During this time, his father repeatedly told MDSS and social workers that he did not want Adrian back. In spite of several years of documented abuse, and the fact that the father explicitly noted that he did not want the child, the state put this little boy back in the care of these two monsters.
Sometime between 2014 and 2015, DCF received hotline calls reporting pictures of Adrian being abused were posted on his stepmother's Facebook page, according to the lawsuit.
In spite of Adrian showing obvious signs of torture and malnutrition, not a single state actor intervened.
They were literally bragging about torturing a child on social media. Again, no action was taken. Months later, it was too late. According to the lawsuit, “naked, tortured, and starved to death, his (Adrian's) remains were found discarded in a pig pen on a farm in Kansas.”
In case after case, we see the state remove children from caring families who may have been caught with a plant or chose to homeschool. TFTP has documented multiple cases in which children were taken from good parents only to be placed into horrifying situations and end up molested, tortured, and murdered.
While Adrian's mother may have been unfit, the fact that multiple state agencies allowed a little boy to be tortured to death, while documenting the abuse along the way, speaks to the gross incompetence of bureaucracies who claim the authority to take children and do with them what they please.
“Let's just realize we need to fix the system we need to stop letting it happen to children it happens too often,” Judy Conway, Adrian's grandmother, said. “When a child flat out says that they're being abused then someone needs to step up and protect that child.”

A pilot study has found that participating in a nine-week training program including elicitation of the relaxation response had a significant impact on clinical symptoms of the gastrointestinal disorders irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and on the expression of genes related to inflammation and the body's response to stress.
The report from investigators at the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), both Harvard affiliates, is the first to study the use of the relaxation response in these disorders and the first to investigate the genomic effects of the relaxation response in individuals with any disorder. The report was published in the open-access journal PLOS ONE.
“Our results suggest exciting possibilities for further developing and implementing this treatment in a wider group of patients with gastrointestinal illness,” said Braden Kuo of the gastrointestinal unit in the MGH Department of Medicine, co-lead author of the report.
“Several studies have found that stress management techniques and other psychological interventions can help patients with IBS, at least in the short term; and while the evidence for IBD is less apparent, some studies have suggested potential benefits. What is novel about our study is demonstration of the impact of a mind/body intervention on the genes controlling inflammatory factors that are known to play a major role in IBD and possibly in IBS,” said Kuo, who is also a Harvard Medical School assistant professor of medicine.
Both IBS and IBD are chronic conditions that produce related symptoms, including abdominal pain and changes in bowel function such as diarrhea. But while IBD — which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis — is characterized by severe inflammation in all or part of the gastrointestinal tract, no inflammation or visible abnormality is present in IBS. Stress appears to exacerbate both conditions, and since the symptoms themselves can increase stress in patients, finding ways to break that vicious cycle could have significant clinical benefits.
The relaxation response — a physiologic state of deep rest induced by practices such as meditation, yoga, and prayer — was first described more than 40 years ago by Herbert Benson, director emeritus of the Benson-Henry Institute and a co-author of the current paper. Many studies have shown that regular practice of the relaxation response not only alleviates stress and anxiety but also directly affects physiologic factors such as blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen consumption. In reports published in 2008 and 2013, Benson, along with Towia Libermann and Manoj Bhasin — both of the BIDMC Genomics, Proteomics, Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Center — described how elicitation of the relaxation response in healthy individuals affected the expression of genes in pathways involved with the body's response to stress, inflammation, and energy metabolism. Libermann is co-senior author and Bhasin is co-lead author of the current study.
The current study was designed to investigate whether a relaxation-response-based intervention could improve the quality of life in patients with IBS or IBD and to analyze the intervention's effects on inflammatory markers and gene expression. The study enrolled 48 adult participants — 19 of whom had been diagnosed with IBS and 29 with IBD — who participated in a nine-week group program focused on stress reduction, cognitive skills, and health-enhancing behaviors. Each of the weekly sessions included relaxation response training, and participants were asked to practice relaxation response elicitation at home for 15 to 20 minutes each day. Along with aspects featured in other group programs offered at the Benson-Henry Institute, this program included a session specifically focused on gastrointestinal health.
Study participants were assessed at the outset, midway through, and at the end of the program, and then three weeks later. The assessments used standardized tools for measuring symptoms common to both disorders, assessing anxiety and pain, and determining the effects of the disorders on participants' quality of life. Blood samples were taken at baseline and a week after the study period's conclusion for purposes of profiling gene expression and measuring known inflammatory factors.
Both in patients with IBS and those with IBD, participation in the mind/body program appeared to have significantly improved disease-related symptoms, anxiety, and overall quality of life, not only at the end of the study period but also three weeks later. While there were no significant changes in inflammatory markers for either group of participants, changes in expression were observed in almost 200 genes among participants with IBS and more than 1,000 genes in those with IBD. Many of the genes with altered expression are known to contribute to pathways involved with stress response and inflammation.
“In both IBS and IBD, the pathway controlled by a protein called NF-κB emerged as one of those most significantly affected by the relaxation response, which confirms the findings of our previous genomic studies,” said Libermann. “Indeed the relaxation response reduced the expression of a number of genes directly linked to the key inflammatory processes of IBD. While the mechanisms behind IBS are less well-defined, they most likely involve stress response, which also could be improved by relaxation response practice.”
Co-senior author John Denninger of the Benson-Henry Institute at MGH noted, “One interesting clinical impact was a decrease in both IBS and IBD patients in what is called pain catastrophizing — a negative cognitive and emotional response to pain or the anticipation of pain. In other words, participants became more resilient in the face of the pain they were experiencing. But before we can offer a program like this to patients with these disorders, we'll need to conduct a longer, randomized trial with a control group and enough participants for statistically significant results.”
Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian spent 544 days in Tehran's notorious Evin prison in the wing for political prisoners before he was released in January. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)
Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, who spent 18 months detained in an Iranian prison before his release in January, will write a book about his ordeal for Ecco.
The memoir, tentatively titled “Hostage: 544 Days, 400 Million Dollars, the Nuclear Deal & Me,” is scheduled for publication in 2018.
“Not knowing when I would get out was an incredible ordeal for my family and me to endure,” says Rezaian, who is studying at Harvard on a Nieman Fellowship. “Now that it's over, the hard work of putting my life back together continues, and that, too, has included many incredible and often surreal moments.”
Rezaian, 40, was born in San Francisco to an Iranian father and an American mother and was raised in Marin County, Calif. He had lived in Iran since 2009 as a freelance journalist before joining The Washington Post in 2012 as Tehran correspondent.
The book will share his experiences growing up as an Iranian American in the United States and reporting from Iran, as well as the story of his imprisonment.
Rezaian says, “I'm looking forward to the opportunity to tell this exciting story, which, while intensely personal, also deals with one of the biggest international news stories of recent times.”
The book was acquired by food-and-travel-focused TV host Anthony Bourdain, who has an imprint with Ecco, a division of HarperCollins.
Rezaian and his wife, journalist Yeganeh Salehi, were filmed in 2014 for CNN's “Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown” program about Iran weeks before the couple's arrest in July. Salehi, who was born in Iran, was detained for more than two months.
“It's an important story. Harrowing and suspenseful, yes. But it's also a deep dive into a complex and egregiously misunderstood country with two very different faces,” Bourdain says. “There is no better time to know more about Iran, and Jason Rezaian has seen both of those faces — the warmth and hospitality of the people, and the cruelty and absurdity of its security apparatus. I am very proud to be publishing him and grateful to have him back.”
[These people I interviewed clearly loved their country. So why did it put them in jail?]
Rezaian was tried on espionage and related charges in a closed-door trial. He spent 544 days in Tehran's notorious Evin prison in the wing for political prisoners, 49 of them in solitary confinement.
In October, Rezaian and his family filed a federal lawsuit against the Iranian government, claiming that he was psychologically tortured and used to influence concessions from the U.S. government in Iran's nuclear negotiations.
“I follow news from Iran very closely still,” he says, “especially the stories of dual nationals like me, who are currently being held hostage there for political reasons.”
Rezaian is a Terker Distinguished Fellow at George Washington University's School of Media & Public Affairs, where he delivers a monthly guest lecture.
Since his release, “I've spent my time recuperating and reconnecting with my family, friends and colleagues,” he says. “I'm catching up on all that happened while I was gone, eating food that I love — burritos, lobster rolls and a lot of ramen — and following the Golden State Warriors with passion.”
And, now, writing his memoir.
Bobby Rainey burst into NFL consciousness -- and probably onto the majority of your fantasy teams -- with his 163 rushing yards and three touchdowns in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' win over the Atlanta Falcons. The showcase earned Rainey the NFC Offensive Player of the Week award for Week 11.
Ben Roethlisberger won the offensive award in the AFC. Big Ben diced up the Detroit Lions, completing 29 of 45 passes (64.4 percent) for 367 yards and four touchdowns, leading the Pittsburgh Steelers to a win that keeps them in the playoff hunt.
New York Giants defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul won the NFC Defensive Player of the Week award, highlighted by his incredible pick six against the Green Bay Packers.
In the AFC, Vontaze Burfict received the Defensive Player of the Week award after registering 15 tackles and one fumble recovery-touchdown in the Cincinnati Bengals' 41-20 victory over the Cleveland Browns.
Adam Vinatieri -- the man who has spiced up the 'should kickers make the Hall of Fame?' argument -- won the AFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his three field goals in the Indianapolis Colts' 30-27 win over the Tennessee Titans.
Since punting plays a big role in the NFL game as well, Philadelphia Eagles booter Donnie Jones was named NFC Special Teams Player of the Week. Jones placed four of his six punts inside the Washington Redskins' 20-yard line.
NFL Media will announce the players of the week every Wednesday on NFL Network's "NFL AM." The list of Week 10 winners can be found right here.

FORT ST. JOHN, B.C. – BC Hydro has fired back against the Royal Society of Canada and 250 professors that say the Site C construction should be halted.
In a press release, BC Hydro says the environmental process for the project was completed back in October of 2014. They went on to say they have no records of the Royal Society participating in the process even though they had many chances to do so.
They also said they are disappointed that the Royal Society chose only to look at the nine-month joint review panel when there was actually a three-year panel completed for Site C.
- Advertisement -
BC Hydro also condemned the statement from the Royal Society that construction at Site C be stopped. The hydro company says they have a promise to keep to customers to build Site C on time and on budget.
According to the release, these are the benefits to Site C from BC Hydro.
Site C will be a source of both clean energy and dependable capacity for the BC Hydro system. The project will provide 1,100 megawatts of capacity and generate 5,100 gigawatt hours of energy per year.
As the third project on one river system, Site C will use water already stored behind the existing W.A.C. Bennett Dam in the Williston Reservoir to generate approximately 35 per cent of the Bennett Dam's energy, with only five per cent of the reservoir area.
Site C will have among the lowest greenhouse gas emissions, per gigawatt hour, compared to other electricity-generation options and significantly less than fossil fuel sources. The Joint Review Panel report stated: “Site C, after an initial burst of expenditure, would lock in low rates for many decades, and would produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than any source save nuclear.”
Site C will be a source of cost-effective power to meet B.C.'s future electricity needs. Over the first 50 years of Site C's project life, ratepayers will save an average of $650 to $900 million each year, compared to alternatives. The Joint Review Panel Report stated: “Site C would be the least expensive of the alternatives, and its cost advantages would increase with the passing decades as inflation makes alternatives more costly.”
The project will create approximately 10,000 person-years of direct employment during construction, and about 33,000 total person-years of employment in total.
Site C will contribute $3.2 billion to provincial GDP during construction from the purchase of goods and services.
BC Hydro says the Royal Society Of Canada never asked to meet or speak with them about Site C. They say they would have been happy to provide them with any information they needed.

CHICAGO — Illinois voters overwhelmingly supported amending the constitution to require all transportation taxes and fees be spent exclusively on transportation projects.
With nearly 40 percent of votes counted, the amendment had the support of 79 percent of votes cast. It needed 60 percent of the vote to become law.
The proposal overwhelmingly passed the state General Assembly earlier this year.
The amendment declares that all revenue raised for the stated purpose of funding transportation projects must end up directly funding transportation projects.
In the past, some revenue raised through methods like vehicle registration fees and excise taxes on gasoline were diverted to fund health care, education programs or social services.
This amendment not only bans those kinds of diversions — it makes them unconstitutional, along with any new laws or provisions that might allow for them. In other words, it creates an untouchable "lockbox" of funding to be used solely for transportation projects, hence the amendment's nickname.
This joins pension funding, in terms of protection in the Illinois constitution, potentially limiting funding for areas like health care, social services and school and university funding.
The measure was backed by groups like the Metropolitan Planning Council, which points to a sharp drop-off in funding for public infrastructure projects all over Illinois. The state's cratering transportation deficit will only get deeper if special measures aren't taken, it argues.
"We know from polls that a big reason people are opposed to raising gas taxes is that they don't have confidence the money would actually be used for transportation," said Jim Reilly, a senior fellow at the council. "A gas tax is a user fee, so we shouldn't be spending it elsewhere."
A broad coalition of business and transportation advocates around the state, including the Illinois Chamber of Commerce, the Illinois Construction Industry Council and the American Society of Civil Engineers, heavily backed the push for the amendment.
The Chicago-based Active Transportation Alliance also expressed cautious support for the measure, trusting that it would "significantly [increase] state funding available for walking, biking and transit" and not just roadways, according to a statement.
But others, like Amanda Kass, assistant director of the University of Chicago's Center for Municipal Finance, published a six-page paper cautioning voters against approving what she called a "highly problematic" amendment.
For one thing, she said, lawmakers trying to wade out of a severe budget crisis would be tying their own hands by restricting how they can use revenue.
"If you think of the entire revenue pie, all this would do is limit the ways that it can be sliced up," Kass said. "But it wouldn't add to the pie. The pie is already too small to begin with, so this would just deepen the hole."
Plus, she said, the vague wording around which "forms of transportation" can get direct funding could bring unintended consequences.
"It's not like a state statute that lawmakers would have the power to change on their own," Kass said. "A court would have to weigh in on everything, using the actual language of the amendment, and that alone should make voters cautious."
Here is the full text of the amendment:
"The proposed amendment provides that no monies derived from taxes, fees, excises, or license taxes, relating to registration, titles, operation, or use of vehicles or public highways, roads, streets, bridges, mass transit, intercity passenger rail, ports, or airports, or motor fuels, including bond proceeds, shall be expended for other than costs of administering laws related to vehicles and transportation, costs for construction, reconstruction, maintenance, repair, and betterment of public highways, roads, streets, bridges, mass transit, intercity passenger rail, ports, airports, or other forms of transportation, and other statutory highway purposes, including the State or local share to match federal aid highway funds."

Eagan, Minnesota (CNN) - Mitt Romney sparkled as he took the stage in Eagan, Minnesota, the day after a blowout victory in Florida's primary.
But the glint in Romney's hair and on his blazer wasn't a post-victory glow. Instead, the GOP candidate was dusted in glitter thrown by a young male protester before Romney took the stage.

Eagan police escorted the young man out of the building after the incident.

Calling the glitter "confetti" to celebrate his Florida victory, Romney brushed off the glitter-bombing – literally and rhetorically.
"Ah, I've got glitter in my hair," he said, and joked about his famously coiffed hair. "That's not all that's in my hair, I tell you that. I glue it on everyday whether I need to or not."
But as the candidate was shaking hands with supporters after his speech, a second person again attempted to blanket Romney with glitter, which he brought to the event in a Pringles can. Escorts quickly moved the glitter-bomber away from Romney.
An individual from the glitter-growing group, Nick Espinosa, said he was affiliated with two operations: Glitterati and Occupy Minneapolis. The intent in throwing the glitter was to underscore Romney's donations to the Mormon church, which Espinosa said was campaigning against gay marriage.
"Minnesota is a state that prides itself on tolerance," Espinosa said.
Romney was not the first GOP candidate to face such an attack. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich was glitter-bombed earlier in the campaign as were former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum and Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann.
During his Eagan rally, Romney was pushed by an audience of several hundred to sing "God Bless America." The candidate frequently quotes from the song on the stump, but received positive reviews for breaking into song at an earlier appearance in Florida.
"If you keep that up I'm going to have to get singing lessons because I'm not so good," he told the audience, which joined him in song.
On Tuesday, a federal law enforcement source said Romney would begin receiving Secret Service protection within days. It's unclear though whether additional security would have stopped such a protest.

The Milwaukee Bucks have traded power forward Ersan Ilyasova to the Detroit Pistons for small forwards Caron Butler and Shawne Williams, reports Yahoo Sports' Adrian Wojnarowski.
The 28-year-old Turkish stretch four had been with the Bucks his entire NBA career, spanning seven seasons, but with the youth movement in place he made little sense on the current roster. Jabari Parker and Giannis Antetokounmpo will be the starting forwards of the future, so Ilyasova was no longer necessary. The Bucks are expected to waive both Butler and Williams since their contracts are not guaranteed for next season, which means the trade saves them around $8 million.
For the Pistons, Ilyasova could help balance out the big man rotation by providing much-needed spacing for the Greg Monroe - Andre Drummond duo. He could also start next to Drummond if Monroe moves on in free agency. Coach Stan Van Gundy has always liked surrounding a dominant center with four shooters and he will get the chance to do just that with Ilyasova, who connected on 39 percent of his three-point attempts last season. Losing Butler's non-guaranteed contract is a small price to pay for an upgrade at a position of need.
A massive search effort after a dozen inmates escaped from the Walker County Jail Sunday night has led to recapture of all but one of them.
Jailers discovered the 12 inmates missing about 6:30 p.m. Sunday. Authorities have not yet said how they broke out.
The Jasper Police Department posted this message on its Facebook page: "JPD has activated additional personnel to assist the Walker County Sheriff's Office in locating multiple escaped inmates from the Walker County Jail. We ask that downtown residents stay indoors and turn on all outdoor lighting."
Walker County Chief Deputy Dayron Bridges said sheriff's official activated off-duty employees to help in the search. Jasper and Parrish police, constables also joined in the hunt. ALEA's Aviation Unit also assisted.
As of 5 a.m. Monday, only one - Brady Andrew Kilpatrick - remained at large. The Cordova man was jailed for possession of a controlled substance,possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of marijuana.
Those who escaped and were quickly recaptured are:
-John Richard Hunter, 26, of Jasper - in jail for burglary, theft, possession of burglary tools and escape.
-Christopher Cole Spain, 18, of Jasper - in jail for failure to appear on disorderly conduct.
-Kristopher Keith Secrest, 20, of Oakman - in jail for felony domestic violence and giving false information to law enforcement.
-Quadrekas Latoddrick Key, 21, of Parrish - in jail for possession of a controlled substance, possession drug parpahernalia and attempting to elude.
-Timothy Chaz Cooper, 28, of Cordova - in jail for breaking and entering a motor vehicle and fourth-degree theft.
-Steven Sanford Hartley, 27, of Hoover - in jail for first-degree theft of property.
Those who escaped and were taken back into custody late Sunday and early Monday are:

Google's Project Fi is an interesting twist on standard cell phone service, one that's full of promise — and it also comes with some surprisingly unique benefits. Google is sending out gifts to a number of Fi subscribers in the form of a Lego kit, one that works as a charging stand for your Nexus phone once assembled. It's not clear if every subscriber gets a kit, but a number of users have been posting photos on — where else — Google+, showing off their Lego docks, complete with the Fi color scheme and a warm holiday welcome. "Thanks for your support," the note reads, "let's build on this." It's not quite a 10,000 brick Millennium Falcons, but it's a neat bonus. Project Fi is still in its early stages, and you can only sign up by requesting an invite; it also only supports three devices at present, the Nexus 5x, 6, and 6P.

This is easily the second best game I've ever played.(Best would have to be Ar Tonelico 2:Melody Of Metafalica.)
The atmosphere is creepy and bizarre,and the story is the most original I've ever seen.
There are moral choices,but not like the ones you'd find in Bioshock or any game by Bioware(Guys who made KOTOR and Mass Effect),no these moral choices WILL disturb you.Unlike those games mentioned,there's no "Little Sister" which you can either kill or save,and there's no random pedestrian who you can Force Choke for merely insulting you.No,these are REAL moral choices.
For instance,the second character you can choose,the Haruspex Burakh,has the ability to rip organs out from corpses.If your offended or creeped out by that,then good,your supposed to be.This game was designed to disturb you,and question morality as you attempt to survive the living nightmare that is happening in the city.
As for the gameplay,it feels like an open-world FPS/RPG/Adventure.The "FPS" part is from the fact that there are guns and two knife weapons,however you don't just "get" them aside from the usually pathetic weapon you start with,you have to work for them.Ammo is either expensive,or scarce,and I mean REALLY scarce to the point where you try to make sure each shot is a headshot.
The only thing close to "RPG statistics" however,is your hunger,immunity,health,stamina,and infection rate.
That's right,you have to feed you character,make sure they don't collapse from exhaustion/a lack of sleep,and make sure that if you get infected,the infection doesn't fully run it's course.At one point,I was seriously considering selling the revolver I found earlier so I could buy food.No other game has done that.
You do happen to a LOT of running around and talking to people.Sometimes,it gets confusing as to where to go,for instance it took me a while to realize that the "Silent House" is actually the same one as Isidor's house.Combat early on isn't that frequent but occurs more often as the days go on,while never turning into a shoot-fest aside from a certain awesome event towards the end that involves the army.
The music is moody,and the fight songs are not only catchy,but I couldn't resist headbanging to them as well.
An odd thing is....There is really only a couple tiny parts which could actually be called "fun" in Pathologic,but the whole experience of the game will keep you playing until the strange ends.(There are multiple endings.)
The combat AI isn't that bad,but it's far from perfect.When an NPC engages in combat,they "lock-in" on their target character,in other words they ignore all other opponents except that one particular target,so if a mugger is trying to stab some old lady,he won't turn around and attack you until the old lady is dead or is out of his range...Even if you shoot the mugger he'll just continue to attack her,not even noticing the fact that your shooting at him.
However,just get this game,and play it until the end at least once.The graphics may be outdated,and at some points the translation is laughable to the point where it's unintentional comic relief,but this is truly a unique game,not to mention that most modern computers can easily handle it.
After you play Pathologic,you will never forget it.
Tips:
When you visit Isidor's house for the first time only to be denied entry,go south a bit to a large area where you shall witness a strange event.Search both of the corpses,one of them has a loaded revolver for you to take.
Muggers only appear really late at night or around 12 PM to 3 AM,but their nasty knife throw will kill you instantly if you don't have at least 90% of your health.Try to wait until they begin attacking someone else,then attack them while they are distracted.
There are two kinds of infection clouds:Static ones which never move and stay in place,and mobile clouds which you have to quickly dodge after which they disappear.
Caffeine is extremely useful,two-five of them will completely fill your stamina back up,and the health lost can be entirely regained using just one healing item.
MAKE SURE you do the Day Quest for EVERY SINGLE DAY,otherwise you will instantly get the Bad Ending upon finishing the story.
When your character updates the Day Quest in his/her journal with an entry that has asterisks in it,that means you've completed the Day Quest.
We like to say that surfers are the vanguard of travelers, scoping out some of the more remote parts of the world for surf breaks before the rest of us get there. Take Siargao: The "teardrop-shaped Philippine island home to more than 15 separate surf breaks, including the legendary Cloud 9, which counts Kelly Slater and Anthony Kedis among its fans" has been popular for a few years, writes Verena von Pfetten for Traveler , but our readers, an adventurous sort, have caught on. There's enough white sand to go around.
Pro tip: Von Pfetten says to check into a villa at Nay Palad Hideaway, formerly Dedon Island Resort : "Almost all accommodation on the island will arrange your airport transfer, but no one else will pick you up in a private chrome-detailed and soft terrycloth-upholstered jeepney complete with cold towels, refreshments, and house-made dried fruit snacks."
Getting there: Fly from Manila to Cebu (or straight to Cebu from Hong Kong or Singapore), and then take a short flight to Sayak Airport (Siargao Island).
What country does the US fail to officially recognize, and yet is legally bound to defend?
The answer is Taiwan, otherwise known as the Republic of China (ROC), a country born as the last redoubt of Chiang Kai-shek and his Nationalist army, which fled to the island in 1949 after being routed on the mainland by the Peoples Liberation Army. There the Nationalists, and their successors, have languished ever since – succored and defended by the US government. While our relationship with the real China is too important to endanger by granting official recognition to the ROC, US support for Taiwan has been generous, consistent, and long-standing.
Long before there was an Israel lobby worth noticing, the infamous China lobby wreathed its multiple tentacles around official Washington, wielding an influence that was very often decisive. During the late forties and fifties, Taiwan's lobby was a major force on the American right, wielding inordinate power – and backed up by large sums of money – in an effort to secure their lifeline to US subsidies and protection. Alfred Kohlberg – an importer and businessman with extensive investments in China – and his allies funded various ultra-conservative groupings in the US, funneling money from Taiwanese government sources to lobbying efforts aimed at supporting Taiwan. Kohlberg, with the aid of Senator Joseph McCarthy, whipped up anti-Communist hysteria to the point where Congress investigated the Institute on Pacific Relations (IPR), which opposed support to Taiwan, targeting it as a "Communist front." The Kohlberg-McCarthy campaign portrayed the State Department and academia as riddled with pro-Communists, traitors intent on having the US abandon the Nationalists, thus giving Mao's Communists free rein in China.
As Murray Rothbard points out in The Betrayal of the American Right, the China lobby was instrumental in steering the Republican party out of the "isolationist" (i.e. anti-interventionist) position it had taken during the Thirties and early Forties, and propelling it into the cold war years and beyond as the party of untrammeled aggression.
In any case, the power of the China lobby waned during the Nixon years and the rapprochement with Mao, but the lobby still had enough power to ensure passage, in 1979, of the Taiwan Relations Act. The Act stipulates that the United States will "consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States." Furthermore, the Act requires the US “to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character,” and “to maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan.”
In short, we are "legally" required to go to war with China in the event Beijing tries to take back their breakaway province, a possibility that has been raised several times in the past half century or so – and could easily arise again. While the power of Taiwan's lobby has long since waned, the arms manufacturers who derive a regular source of income from the provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act – Lockheed-Martin, United Technologies, Boeing, and Raytheon – employ a powerful Washington lobby that doubtless had a major hand in getting the go-ahead for the $6.4 billion arms deal. That's what Washington is all about: the national interest has little if anything to do with it. As long as the merchants of death make huge profits – while the rest of the country is slipping into an economic depression – that's all anyone in the Imperial City cares about.
China has reacted with ill-concealed rage, breaking off its limited military cooperation with the US, and threatening sanctions against American companies involved in the deal. Most notable, however, is not the content but the intensity of Beijing's protest, as reported in the Washington Post, over a headline detailing how "China's Strident Tone Raises Concern Among Western Governments, Analysts":
"China's indignant reaction to the announcement of U.S. plans to sell weapons to Taiwan appears to be in keeping with a new triumphalist attitude from Beijing that is worrying governments and analysts across the globe."
Ever since the end of the cold war, the US has stood astride the globe triumphantly proclaiming its "right" to attack any nation, anywhere, for any reason, "preemptively" – but it's the Chinese who are the "triumphalists"!
To put the issue in proper perspective: Imagine if Texas governor Rick Perry carried out his half-serious suggestion that Texas secedes from the Union, and China opted to sell the Republic of Texas $6 billion worth of Patriot missiles, Blackhawk helicopters, and sophisticated detection systems – for "defensive" purposes only, of course. Washington would rightly consider this very close to an act of war.
To the Washington Post, however, other nations have no right to assert their sovereignty: indeed, such impertinence is usually punishable by having "rogue nation" status conferred upon the "transgressor," who is from that moment a prime candidate for "regime change."
The Post details the list of issues that vex US-China relations, including climate-change and "cyber-security." The US claims China is somehow involved in hacker attacks on Google, as well as other targets, albeit without providing much in the way of evidence. The climate-change dispute is over China's refusal to surrender its national sovereignty to Western technocrats intent on reducing emissions and "saving" the earth from the ravages of technology. China, for its part, is just now entering modernity, and is not about to let itself be pushed back into a pastoral pre-industrial existence by environmentalist do-gooders.
According to the Post, "This new posture has befuddled Western officials and analysts: Is it just China's tone that is changing or are its policies changing as well?"
It's only natural that the Post, the voice of Imperial Washington, is "befuddled" by such obstinacy. They simply can't understand why the Chinese guard their sovereignty so jealously, and seem to treasure their independence from the West. Why oh why won't they go along with the program?
It is often stated that the Chinese will never dump their lion's share of US debt instruments because they would stand to lose an awful lot of money. As US-China relations take a turn for the worse –with the US firing the first shots of a trade war by imposing tariff restrictions on selected Chinese goods – the certainty of Chinese restraint becomes highly problematic. The Chinese have already warned the US government their debt level is making such investments highly risky, and Beijing may not be averse to playing the debt card if it involves a mater of national pride – or national self-preservation.
If China really felt threatened by US arms sales to Taiwan – perhaps as a prelude to an official declaration of independence on the part of the ROC – they have the power to stop US military aid dead in its tracks. All they have to do is simply cease buying up the US debt – and dump what they have. That would be the financial equivalent of a nuclear detonation going off in the center of Washington. It's a measure of the political pull of the arms lobby, and the anti-mainlanders in US officialdom, that we're taking that kind of risk.
In needlessly provoking the Chinese, the Obama administration is caving in to the lobbyists, both foreign and domestic, and their allies in the War Party, who would like nothing better than a new enemy to justify their profit margins and ceaseless warmongering. Our real national interests lie in maintaining peaceful trade relations with the country that has replaced us as the world's factory. We have no interest, not even an ideological one, in supporting the Taiwanese secessionists against the central government in Beijing: While China is an authoritarian state, Taiwan is very far from being a democracy. The form is there, but the content is sadly lacking.
Even if Taiwan were a Jeffersonian republic, however, we still could not rationally guarantee its security in the face of China's overwhelming presence. The idea of going to war with the mainland over the status of Taiwan is absurd: in reality, such a war would make short work of the Taiwanese themselves, and we would be left with a major conflict on our hands – one we would soon regret initiating.
It is simply not realistic to pretend we can guarantee Taiwan's sovereignty, and, to make matters simpler, this realization does not involve any concession of principle. Indeed, the official US position is that it has no position, whilst maintaining only unofficial relations with Taiwan's government in deference to Beijing. Will we go to war to preserve a government we haven't even granted the courtesy of official recognition?
The Chinese Communist regime, left to itself, cannot and will not survive: the pressures of modernity on the strictures imposed by the "Chinese road to socialism" are bound to crack the system at its very foundations. China, like the old Russian empire, can be characterized as a veritable "prison-house of nations," and is bursting with ethnic tensions nearly invisible to the Western eye. As in the former Soviet bloc countries, no one believes the official ideology, a highly compromised form of "market socialism" with a totalitarian overlay. All of these factors militate against the survival of the last major Marxist regime on earth.
However, the demise of Marxism-Leninism as the ideological inspiration of Chinese government cadres has created a void increasingly filled by ultra-nationalism.
The West remembers the Tiananmen Square protests and the "goddess of democracy," but more recent manifestations of popular sentiment have centered around perceived insults from foreigners: e.g., the Hainan island incident in 2001, which brought out thousands of Chinese students protesting "US imperialism." The sometimes violent protests were tamped down by the government, which has good reason to fear any expression of popular opinion – especially opinion that implicitly criticizes them for being soft on the Americans.
For the moment, the leaders of the Communist Party have been wary of whipping up too much nationalistic sentiment, in fear it could boomerang. If pressed, however, the leadership could well take a nationalistic turn, in which case China's foreign policy – so far relatively pacific and inward-looking – could take a more aggressive turn. In which case our actions will have provoked and encouraged the very outcomes they were supposed to prevent.
In poking our sword at the dragon, we take the risk it may suddenly awake. Better to let him die in his sleep.

Land dispute
MLAs Zameer Ahmed Khan and Akhanda Srinivas Murthy assured the people that talks would be held with the PRTC, after which the crowd dispersed.
A few residents of Bengaluru's Kaval Bairasandra on Wednesday woke up to the sight of the Mysore Lancer Masjid being locked down by personnel of the Parachute Regiment Training Centre (PRTC). Residents claim the mosque is more than 100 years old.
At around 9.30am, a few of the PRTC personnel entered the homes of the mosque's Imam and his attendant and locked down their homes.
“On Saturday (August 28), the PRTC had issued a notice to the mosque and the Imam and his attendant who live in homes right next to the mosque, stating that the land was defence property and hence they had to vacate. We had filed a writ petition with the Karnataka High Court on Monday asking for a stay and had asked the PRTC to wait until the court either granted or rejected the plea,” said Aslam, a member of the Lancer Masjid Committee.
The masjid's committee members alleged that the PRTC personnel did not wait for the court order and locked down the premises with the attendant's wife inside the home.
“They diverted people's attention by blocking the path to the masjid by dumping mud. In the meantime, a few PRTC men entered the area where the Imam's home is located and locked it down. They moved on to the attendant's home and his wife was in there. They did not listen to her and locked down the home while she was inside the house. They later locked down the mosque as well,” the committee member added.
The committee members alleged that by the time the PRTC men had locked the mosque, about 200 people were already inside it.
“We did not budge and sat down in silent protest. The PRTC subordinates kept telling their senior to pass the order and they would ensure that the place is shut down. The subordinates were willing to go to any extent to shut down the mosque. But the senior officials, who knew that the situation would escalate, told them to stand down,” Aslam added.
At 11.30am, the mosque's committee had obtained the stay order against the PRTC's order issued on Saturday.
“There were over 2,000 people who had gathered. The PRTC had barricaded the area near the mosque's wall and the road to the mosque was also blocked. The committee members were near the mosque while most of the common people were on the other side of the barricade. We were not able to communicate with them. Videos began circulating on WhatsApp and Facebook. People started spreading news that the mosque was demolished. This misinformation was because we were not able to communicate with the people on the other side,” Aslam added.
At 1pm, Aslam requested the PRTC personnel to allow the people to perform namaaz. The PRTC had agreed to the request. However, with no communication between the committee members and the people on the other side of the barricade, the people, assuming that the PRTC had refused to allow them to pray, pushed the PRTC personnel. That's when the lathi charge began.
Aslam and the committee members then spoke to the people and calmed down the crowd. The people then performed namaaz and the PRTC pulled back as the stay order was passed.
In a press release, the Army maintained that the mosque was built on the defense land during the pre-independence period and a notice was served when they realised people were illegally occupying the land.
"The local military authorities initiated eviction process to take over administration of the Mosque with the assistance of State police including lady police who were in attendance during the process of eviction. All legal procedures were followed during the conduct of the eviction process. Throughout the proceedings, the Army Personnel displayed highest degree of restraint, discipline and compassion. No restrictions on access to the Mosque were imposed on locals to offer the prayers," the statement read.
Background
The 113-year-old mosque is located on 4.5 acres of land owned by the Waqf Board. The issue began in 1998, when the PRTC claimed ownership of the land and demanded that the people vacate the mosque. The Imam of the mosque, his helper, and a few other families live in eight houses next to the mosque. Over the years, many families have left the place due to the dispute and only three families, including the Imam live there.
Aslam filed a case with the Waqf Tribunal against the PRTC's attempts to take over the land. Although the mosque committee produced ownership documents, the PRTC did not budge. In 2011, the Waqf Board, in an order said that status quo must prevail. The case is still pending at the Waqf Tribunal.
The PRTC then moved the Karnataka HC, asking the case to be considered in a civilian court and not at the Waqf tribunal.
“They have closed the Mysore Lancers Road and also the Desuraj Urs Road. The current road, which weaves through Kaval Bairasandra was constructed in March 2003. A few days after the mud road was carved out, the PRTC shut it down and told us to enter from the main entrance of the Mysore Lancer's property. They allowed us to use the road for three days and then shut it down. We had protested then as well. This issue has been going on for 18 years now and we will not budge,” Aslam added.
MLAs Zameer Ahmed Khan and Akhanda Srinivas Murthy assured the people that talks would be held with the PRTC, after which the crowd dispersed.
The microbes could surrender to the harmless virus, but instead freeze in place, dormant, waiting for their potential predator to go away, according to a recent study in mBio.
University of Illinois researchers found that Sulfolobus islandicus can go dormant, ceasing to grow and reproduce, in order to protect themselves from infection by Sulfolobus spindle-shaped virus 9 (SSV9). The dormant microbes are able to recover if the virus goes away within 24 to 48 hours--otherwise they die.
"The microbe is hedging its bet," said Associate Professor of Microbiology Rachel Whitaker, who led the research at the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology. "If they go dormant, they might die, but we think this must be better than getting infected and passing it on."
Sulfolobus is a species of archaea (a domain of single-celled organisms distinct from bacteria) found in acidic hot springs all over the world, where free viruses are not as common as in other environments. These microbes will go dormant in the presence of just a few viruses, whether active or inactive. While inactivated virus particles cannot infect a host, Whitaker's lab found they could still cause dormancy, and ultimately, death in Sulfolobus.
"People thought these inactivated viruses were just an accident, that they were just mispackaged," Whitaker said. "Now we know they are being sensed by the host so they are having an effect. People are starting to think that it is adaptive for the virus to produce inactivated virus particles."
Sulfolobus have an adaptive immune system found in archaea and bacteria that allows the microbe to encode a specific piece of DNA that matches the viral DNA, causing it to target the viral DNA and degrade it thus preventing the virus from propagating, or reproducing. Cultures with immunity to SSV9 recover from dormancy and grow normally once the virus is removed from the culture. Microbes without this immunity are susceptible to infection and eventually kill their neighbors by maintaining viral particles in the environment.
The researchers do not know exactly what is going on while the microbes are dormant, only that the microbes look drastically different in that state. More research is needed to better understand these new interactions between microbes and viruses. Incorporating these findings into models will show the true ecological impact of viruses in the microbial world, Whitaker said.
"We really don't understand the way that viruses affect microbes," Whitaker said. "There is a lot to learn. These communities are usually modeled where a virus will either kill the microbe or the microbe is resistant. But actually there are all these other subtleties going on, like dormancy, that are having a bigger impact than we understand."
Dormant microbes are found everywhere, in water, soil, and even the human gut, said Maria Bautista, a graduate student in Whitaker's lab, who led the research.
"Many microbes go dormant when they face environmental stress such as a change in pH or temperature " Bautista said. "Maybe virus-induced dormancy is something that doesn't just happen in Sulfolobus; it may be a widespread response to viruses in other environments. We don't know."
The Raiders offseason got started Tuesday as the team signed nine players to futures contracts.
The players will compete for a roster spot once training camp begins in July, something six of the nine players signed are familiar with after finishing the season on Oakland's practice squad.
RB Terrance Cobb, WR Jeremy Gallon, LB Justin Jackson, DB Vernon Kearney, T Dan Kistler, G Lamar Mady, WR Seth Roberts, DT Kona Shwenke, CB Jansen Watson agreed to term.
Of them all, Jeremy Gallon is the most intriguing.
The five-foot-eight Michigan receiver was drafted in the seventh round of the 2014 draft by the Patriots, but was unable to log any time with the team.
He ran a 4.49 40-yard-dash at his pro day, benched 15 reps of 225 pounds, and was All-State with his alma mater.
NFL.com's initial draft analysis said:
“Stocky, strong slot receiver with more of a running back's build, Gallon possesses the hands, zone awareness and toughness to fend for a job in the pros. Lacks the top-end speed desired as a kick returner, but shows enough burst to warrant an opportunity fielding punts.”
His measureables scream slot receiver, and that's probably the job he'll be competing for beyond special teams.

Blackwater (now known as Academi) got kicked out of Iraq specifically for shooting 17 civilians in 2007, but they shot a lot more than that, including a dog raised by a group of New York Times reporters, according to a cache of documents obtained by Gawker. The trove of thousands of reports detailing every time a security contractor fired a weapon in Iraq came as the result of Freedom of Information Act Gawker filed four years ago. As writer John Cook points out, a lot of the stories the documents tell have already been made public, but there are thousands of pages to pore through so they went ahead and posted the entire collection online. One story from 2007, that we missed in Reuters at the time, was about a group of Blackwater contractors who shot a dog that New York Times reporters had raised from a puppy, when it reportedly attacked their own dog.
After killing the "stray" dog, the Blackwater team learned that it was in fact was a pet and "basically a mascot.... Several New York Times reporters subsequently came out of the residence and were saddened to learn that their 'favorite' dog had been shot. [Redacted] spoke to [redacted] and the reporters and did a good job smoothing things over and de-escalating the situation."
Another incident in which fellow security contractor Dynacorp* shot a guy who turned out to be a judge for driving too fast, hitting him in the leg, certainly ranks higher on the scale of diplomatic importance. But come on, who shoots a dog? That's just low.
Correction: An earlier version of this story reported that Blackwater was responsible for shooting both the judge and the dog. It was not.

LAKE WALES. Fla—On the 20th anniversary of its invention at IBM Research, fabled nonvolatile "universal" magnetic random access memory (MRAM) is getting an upgrade. IBM announced today (July 7) that, in collaboration with foundry-giant Samsung, it is using a spin-transfer torque (STT) design on its MRAM.
Faster than flash and as dense as dynamic random access memory (DRAM), this universal memory genre is now being readied for manufacturing with a final round of material optimization and engineering finesse at IBM (Yorktown Heights, N.Y.). IBM says its STT MRAM access clocks at 10 nanoseconds and ultra-low-power (7.5 microamps), claiming its MRAM outperforms flash at the speed of DRAM. Applications include everything from tiny Internet of Things (IoT) system-on-chips (SoCs) to vast mass storage systems for servers.
"IBM has been working for 20 years on the magnetic random access memory, or MRAM, starting from a DARPA [Defense Advanced Research Project Agency] funded research project, along with Motorola, on field-switched MRAM," Daniel Worledge, lead researcher, distinguished research staff member and senior manager of MRAM at IBM Research (Yorktown Heights, N.Y.) told EE Times. "IBM's John Slonczewski invented the spin-torque switching method for MRAM back in 1996, but at first we thought the field-switched method was best."
"We switched to the spin torque technique after a DARPA-funded research project with Motorola. Now we are celebrating its 20th anniversary after having scaled down the design to 11-nanometer in collaboration with Samsung," said Worledge.
Worledge does not believe that IBM's STT MRAM will replace DRAM anytime soon but believes it can replace embedded flash, since SST MRAM is easier to embed, faster and has unlimited reads and writes, unlike flash which is typically limited to 10,000. Next IBM plans to optimize the cell's engineering parameters, for mass production with a partner in as little as three years.
Each bit-cell of a spin transfer torque (STT) magnetic random access memory (MRAM) contains one transistor and one tunnel junction arranged vertically. The tunnel junction is composed of a fixed magnet whose north pole always points up, and a free magnet whose north pole points up or down depending on whether it is storing a '0' or '1', respectively. It is programmed by merely passing a 7.5 microamp current through it in the direction of desired polarization.

The biggest challenge that the IBM/Samsung overcame was building a vertically oriented cell.
"We knew back in 2009 that to scale as well or better than DRAM we had to have a vertical magnetic cell, just as DRAM has to have a vertical capacitive cell," Worledge told EE Times. "But it took our earlier collaboration with TDK to create the vertical architecture. We also partnered with Micron briefly, which continues to work on MRAM, but it took our partnership with Samsung, which had its MRAM Forum at out Zurich Lab last week, to scale the vertical architecture down to 11-nanometers with a clear path to 10-nanometers."
The reason spin-transfer-torque is such an important part of the architecture, compared with the magnetic-field switched MRAMs being sold by EverSpin and others today, is that only 7.5 microamps is required to write a bit, compared to milliamps for field-switched bit-cells.
How it works
In more detail, IBM uses a single field-effect transistor (FET) controlling the read/write current flowing through a vertical magnetic-tunnel-junction (MRJ) in its STT MRAM. The FET, on the bottom of the stack, connects to the MTJ, which consists of a cobalt-iron-boron (CoFeB) layer with a fixed spin-orientation, a magnesium-oxide (MgO) tunnel barrier and a top layer of CoFeB whose spin can be changed thus storing the one or zero. The stack was capped with another MgO layer to enhance the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and reduce the spin-current loss related to spin-pumping.
Daniel Worledge, the lead research scientist and senior manager in the MRAM group at IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, N.Y.

The resulting bit-cell switches in as little as 10-nanoseconds by merely reversing the current through it. If the current flows up through the junction the bit is flipped to the same orientation as the bottom CoFeB layer. If current flows from the top to the bottom of the cell, the bit reflects backwards thus flipping the top CoFeB layer to the opposite spin relative to the fixed bottom CoFeB layer. Because no atoms are moved, this operation can be performed any number of times without limit. And by optimizing the engineering of the cell, its retention lifetime can be adjusted from 10-to-20 years, according to Worledge.
IBM scientist Janusz Nowak co-authored the IEEE Magnetic Letters paper on scaling the spin-transfer torque (STT) magnetic random access memory (MRAM) down to 11-nanometers.

"The key advantages of STT MRAMs are the combination of nonvolatility and infinite endurance unlike any other memory today or in the foreseeable future, plus its ability to have their retention adjusted by optimizing the size of the bits and the perpendicular anisotropy of the magnetic material," Worledge told EE Times.
In testing its design, the write-error-rate was one error in 1.4 billion writes, low enough to be easily made flawless with standard error-correction techniques, according to Worledge.

The Atlantic Coast Conference—ACC—is a very competitive conference within the NCAA, known as one of the most powerful conferences in all college sports. However, there are many other powerful conferences in college sports, such as the SEC, the Big 10, the PAC 12, and the Big 12. And yet none of these compare to the ACC. Here are 10 reasons the ACC is the best conference in the NCAA:
1. In-state Rivalries
Although this is true for every major college, the ACC has a plethora of in-state rivalries. This includes Virginia and Virginia Tech, FSU and Miami, and Duke and UNC. The competition intensifies when state bragging rights are on the line, making a fun show for the fans. And the competition is close; the Commonwealth Clash—a competition between Virginia and Virginia Tech sports—is currently a close competition, with a slight 1.5 point edge to UVA.
2. Academics
Although this article is about the athletic talent of the student athletes of the ACC, it is important to recognize that an integral part of being a student athlete is being a student. In the National University Rankings, the ACC has five schools (Duke, Notre Dame, UVA, Wake Forest, Boston College) in the top 30. Furthermore, the ACC has the highest average for college rankings at 55.80, with only two universities lying outside of the top 100 Universities in academics.
3. Top-ranked Teams
The ACC has a reputation of having the top-ranked teams in all college sports. This year in football, Clemson ended the season as the number one seed, even making it to the National Championship. UNC started the season as the number one ranked team in Men's College Basketball, and teams like UVA, Duke, and Louisville have had success as well. In Baseball, UVA is the reigning NCAA Champion, and is ranked in the top five to start the season.
4. Competition
Within the ACC, every conference game is looked at as a championship game. The competition intensifies when ACC teams face off. In Men's Basketball, six teams are ranked in the top 25 and have a conference record of 10-5 or better. Of those teams, the longest win streak is three games.
5. Fan Loyalty
ACC fans bleed their team colors; the allegiance to the team is deep. Unlike other conferences (SEC, Big 10, Pac 12), ACC fans have been here for the long haul and always will be. The bandwagon has left us behind, we'll stick with our team.
6. Resilience of Student Athletes
The ACC has competitors on and off the field. The fierce competition on the field cannot even begin to explain ACC athletes who face challenges off of the field; this is exemplified in Pittsburgh running back James Conner, who was the 2014 ACC player of the year, and was recently diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma. However, he has now resumed working with the team, and is looking to return for the 2016 season.
7. Championships
Last year, UVA won the Capital One Cup, which is a sign of a overall successful sports program. This included championships in baseball, men's soccer, and men's tennis. The ACC is always in competition for winning championships; UNC has 40 championships overall.
8. Athletes Going Pro
The ACC has sent many athletes to the pros, such as football players Michael Vick from Virginia Tech, Calvin Johnson from Georgia Tech, Heath Miller from Virginia, Jameis Winston from FSU, Andre Johnson from Miami, and Larry Fitzgerald from Pitt. Baseball player Matt Harvey, UNC graduate, is currently dominating the MLB, and looks to be the powerhouse pitcher for the New York Mets.
9. Mascots
Even though this is a less serious point than the others, the ACC does have the best mascots (personally, I'm partial to Cav Man).
10. Community
This article has been primarily about the competitiveness of the ACC. And that's what helps create passion in sports. As a UVA student, I will be the first to say that I get immense joy when we beat Virginia Tech, Duke, or any other ACC team. But, when something serious happens, we rally in full support. After April 16th, Hoos for Hokies became the longest painted message on Beta Bridge, and continues to be painted on in memory of the ones who lost their lives on April 16. Even though we're rivals, we support each other when tragedy strikes. And that is truly what makes us the best conference in the NCAA; a bond that goes deeper than sports and rivalries.

Studies dating back nearly a century noted a striking finding. If you take young, healthy people and split them up into two groups, half on a fat-rich diet, and the other half on a carb-rich diet, within just two days, this is what happens. The glucose intolerance skyrockets in the fatty diet group. In response to the same sugar water challenge, the group that had been shoveling in fat ended up with twice the blood sugar. As the amount of fat in the diet goes up, one's blood sugar spikes. It would take scientists nearly seven decades to unravel this mystery, but it would end up holding the key to our current understanding of the cause of type 2 diabetes.
When athletes carb-load before a race, they're trying to build up the fuel supply within their muscles. They break down the starch into glucose in their digestive tract. It circulates as blood glucose—blood sugar—and is taken up by our muscles, to be stored and burned for energy.
Blood sugar, though, is like a vampire. It needs an invitation to come into our cells. And, that invitation is insulin. Here's a muscle cell. Here's some blood sugar outside, waiting patiently to come in. Insulin is the key that unlocks the door to let sugar in our blood enter the muscle cell. When insulin attaches to the insulin receptor, it activates an enzyme, which activates another enzyme, which activates two more enzymes, which finally activate glucose transport, which acts as a gateway for glucose to enter the cell. So, insulin is the key that unlocks the door into our muscle cells.
What if there was no insulin, though? Well, blood sugar would be stuck out in the bloodstream, banging on the door to our muscles, and not able to get inside. And so, with nowhere to go, sugar levels would rise and rise.
That's what happens in type 1 diabetes; the cells in the pancreas that make insulin get destroyed, and without insulin, sugar in the blood can't get out of the blood into the muscles, and blood sugar rises.
But, there's a second way we could end up with high blood sugar. What if there's enough insulin, but the insulin doesn't work? The key is there, but something's gummed up the lock. This is called insulin resistance. Our muscle cells become resistant to the effect of insulin. What's gumming up the door locks on our muscle cells, preventing insulin from letting sugar in? Fat. What's called intramyocellular lipid, or fat inside our muscle cells.
Fat in the bloodstream can build up inside the muscle cells, create toxic fatty breakdown products and free radicals that can block the signaling pathway process. So, no matter how much insulin we have out in our blood, it's not able to open the glucose gates, and blood sugar levels build up in the blood.
This mechanism, by which fat (specifically saturated fat) induces insulin resistance, wasn't known until fancy MRI techniques were developed to see what was happening inside people's muscles as fat was infused into their bloodstream. And, that's how scientists found that elevation of fat levels in the blood “causes insulin resistance by inhibition of glucose transport” into the muscles.
And, this can happen within just three hours. One hit of fat can start causing insulin resistance, inhibiting glucose uptake after just 160 minutes.
Same thing happens to adolescents. You infuse fat into their bloodstream. It builds up in their muscles, and decreases their insulin sensitivity—showing that increased fat in the blood can be an important contributor to insulin resistance.
Then, you can do the opposite experiment. Lower the level of fat in people's blood, and the insulin resistance comes right down. Clear the fat out of the blood, and you can clear the sugar out of the blood. So, that explains this finding. On the high-fat diet, the ketogenic diet, insulin doesn't work as well. Our bodies are insulin-resistant.
But, as the amount of fat in our diet gets lower and lower, insulin works better and better. This is a clear demonstration that the sugar tolerance of even healthy individuals can be “impaired by administering a low-carb, high-fat diet.” But, we can decrease insulin resistance—the cause of prediabetes, the cause of type 2 diabetes—by decreasing saturated fat intake.

Jeb Bush invoked Terri Schiavo. Rand Paul called for cutting foreign aid to countries that “persecute Christians.” And Ted Cruz warned that a Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage would amount to “naked and lawless judicial activism.”
Washington's annual social conservative cattle call, a three-day event hosted by the Faith & Freedom Coalition, has so far amounted to a message test for a dozen Republicans running for president, each tailoring rhetoric they hope resonates among the religious right.
Story Continued Below
Some quoted scripture and others hewed closely to their stump speeches. But the ones who found particular favor with their audience — a potent force in GOP primary politics — described a conservative Christian community under siege by government, Democrats and an increasingly godless society.
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal warned of an “assault on religious liberty” in America. Paul called it “a sickness.” Bush said freedom of religion was “under attack.” But few were more hot-blooded than Cruz, who argued that a recent battle in Indiana over a religious freedom law — ripped by opponents as an attack on gay rights — exposed many of his Republican competitors as weak-kneed.
“More than few Republicans, sadly, even more than a few Republican running for president in 2016, chose that moment to go rearrange their sock drawer,” he said. Cruz referenced William Barret Travis, who, according to legend, drew a line in the sand with his saber to determine which of his men were willing to die defending the Alamo. “You choose which side of the line you're on,” Cruz said.
The candidates are betting that the moment is right to mobilize evangelicals and other Christians worried about the erosion of religious values in America. The latest blow, they fear, will come later this month, when the Supreme Court is set to decide whether same-sex marriage is legal nationwide. That anxiety was on display throughout the conference, which included a panel discussion dubbed “The War on Christianity” and it was threaded through many speeches by non-candidates too — Rep. Steve King called for “civil disobedience” if the Supreme Court supports gay marriage
Bush, who has run afoul of the GOP base by supporting immigration reform and Common Core education standards, emphasized his Catholicism and social conservatism.
“We shouldn't push aside those who believe in traditional marriage,” he said, touching on a subject he rarely brings up during his forays into Iowa and New Hampshire.
As he did in his announcement speech in Miami Monday, Bush focused on his belief in religious freedom and blasted Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration for suing Hobby Lobby and Little Sisters of the Poor over their religious objections to Obamacare.
“Religious freedom now is under attack more than ever before,” Bush said, as he defended religion generally as “the greatest force for good in the world.”
“If we act on our faith everyday, we're going to create a more just, more loving world,” Bush said.
The former Florida governor reminded the audience of his intervention on behalf of Schiavo's family in the 2005 right-to-die case in an effort to keep her alive.
“When I was asked to intervene on behalf of a woman who could not speak up for herself…I stood on her side,” Bush said.
He also emphasized his work during two terms as Florida governor regulating abortion clinics, signing a bill into law requiring parental notification and another banning partial-birth abortions.
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also mentioned abortion, albeit obliquely, telling the audience it's important to support people before and after they're born.
“I believe if you are pro-life, as I am, you need to be pro-life for the whole life,” Christie said, pivoting to his own record and his administration's prioritizing of drug treatment over incarceration for nonviolent offenders and its support for expanding educational opportunity through charter schools. “You can't just afford to be pro-life when the human being is in the womb.”
In fact, the issue of abortion rarely came up in the candidates' comments. Cruz, Paul and Sen. Marco Rubio barely discussed it at all. It was left largely to other speakers — Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson and Iowa's King — to broach the subject with any force.
The forum, which continues Saturday with speeches from Carly Fiorina and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, also offered a chance for underperforming candidates to find new energy.
Jindal trails badly in early polling, but on Friday, he found a receptive audience, earning one of the most enthusiastic receptions of the morning. Jindal, who is expected to announce for president next week, tapped into the siege mentality that has gripped many religious conservatives, charging that under the Obama administration, the ability to freely practice faith is under attack. He blasted the Obamacare contraception coverage mandate that became an issue for Hobby Lobby, described his path to Catholicism — he converted from Hinduism — and jabbed at Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, who once opposed same-sex marriage, saying, “My views on marriage are not evolving with the polls.”

The Louisiana governor was one of the earliest and consistently the loudest voices supporting the Indiana religious freedom measure and, like Cruz, tore into businesses that opposed the law.
“I've got a message for big business: You're now in bed with the folks who want to tax you and regulate you,” he charged.
To big applause, Jindal argued, “The United States of America did not create religious liberty. Religious liberty created the United States of America.”
Even former New York Gov. George Pataki, whose barely perceptible presidential campaign launched last month, found that standing up for religious liberty could energize his audience. He quoted St. Francis of Assisi and hailed a recent Supreme Court ruling preventing limits on pastors who wish to advertise when they hold services.
Others tested mellower messages and mixed in stories about the role of faith in their lives, like Ben Carson, who quoted proverbs and emphasized a belief that God (not evolution) created humanity. He said that God helped him find his wife more than 40 years ago, after years of ignoring romantic relationships to focus on his studies.
“He's available if we just ask him for stuff in terms of our faith,” he said.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich — who's taken flak from Republicans for invoking God to justify controversial decisions — spent the bulk of his speech … invoking god to justify controversial decisions.
“I have a mission and I have a role on this Earth, but I'm trying to prepare myself for the world to come,” he said, describing his policy decisions to aid the working poor through Medicaid expansion and through de-emphasizing incarceration for convicts with mental health issues. It just so happens, he said, that those decisions made good politics, too, leading to a resounding reelection last year in which he won a quarter of the African American vote and a majority of women.
“Why did that happen? Hope returned,” he said, adding, “That's what has to happen in America.”
I've been seeing a pattern in social media lately: a celebrity known for being “progressive” says or does something, well, not very progressive, and becomes a target of abuse. And then, just as quickly, legions of fans rush to defend them. For a few days, the internet is locked in battle. Patricia Arquette, Tina Fey, Lena Dunham. Now Trevor Noah, the incoming host of The Daily Show, is the center of a fight over misogynistic, anti-Semitic, transphobic tweets. A sample:
Are these people all hypocrites hiding their self-interest and privilege in the guise of progressive politics, or is call-out culture demonizing well-meaning celebrities for simple mistakes?
Chill out. Your fave is problematic. Deal with it.
I don't care who your fave is. It's true for all of them.
The fact that your fave is problematic isn't a big deal — the big deal is if we ignore it. Patricia Arquette's Oscar speech was entitled, privileged and racially insensitive. Tina Fey's new show is racist, Trevor Noah has made transphobic and sexist and anti-Semitic jokes, Lena Dunham's feminism is very privileged and largely excludes women of color. They have contributed to systems of injustice that oppress others. These things are all true.
Patricia Arquette is a dedicated women's rights activist and a talented actress, Tina Fey is a ground-breaking comedic writer who has opened doors for many women, Trevor Noah is a very talented comedian whose new role as host of The Daily Show is important to the visibility of people of color in the media, Lena Dunham is a very talented writer who has accomplished great things at a young age and has changed the way we view young women in the arts. These things are also true.
So can we just talk about it?
A lot of bookclubs are as much about the drinking and eating as they are about books.
For the longest time, I really tried to bring a dish that corresponded with the books we read for my bookclub. It was an apple pie for the Lincoln biography Team of Rivals and donuts for Olive Kitteridge (not a single donut was eaten).
Anyway, this is not about me. It's about Pinnacle Whipped Cream vodka.
The evening's host served us each a shot over ice, and boy-oh-boy, is this delicious. A drink and dessert all in one.
The whipped cream is just one of Pinnacle's 29 infused vodkas. Other flavors include cake, banana, and root beer.
It's $19.99 for a half gallon and is available at major liquor stores
Another bottle made a crucial cameo appearance that evening as well.
Actually, Wine Away ($8.99 at Amazon.com) has been called into service before at bookclub.
On this evening, the host's bouncy puppy caused a bouncy wine glass and stains on the upholstery. A few sprays and the stains were gone.

The tagline for one of Geostorm‘s billboards: “Some Things Were Never Meant to Be Controlled.”
You might think that saying refers to the disaster movie's exorbitant estimated $120M-$140M budget, or its three-year production cycle, or even its horrendous domestic box office start of $13.3M.
However, when it came to bringing this troubled Dean Devlin-directed feature to the market, Warner Bros., Skydance Media and Jerry Bruckheimer Films did everything in their power to harness and correct what was initially an “unwatchable” disaster movie, per one source, before Geostorm went into $15M of re-shoots last December.
The recent headlines about natural disasters in Houston, Florida, and Puerto Rico come as a handy excuse for Geostorm‘s studio partners when explaining what went wrong. However, this disaster pic's problems were quite clear before it opened. Geostorm is a sub-genre that moviegoers have seen before all too often, and it's from a blockbuster producer-turned-first-time-director who largely went unsupervised during production.
If anything, time hasn't been on Geostorm's side, and if there's one takeaway here, it's that production delays and an extensive lengthy time between greenlight and release –in this case, three years – can spell doom for an intended event film. Audiences' tastes in the social era can turn at the drop of a hat, and if there's one genre that's been a casualty of this recently, it's been broad raunchy comedies like Rough Night, Neighbors 2, and The House. Geostorm was originally scheduled to open on March 25, 2016. That release date would get pushed three more times to Oct. 21, 2016, then the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday weekend of Jan. 13, and finally Oct. 20.
. San Andreas Warner Bros.
So putting the notion of ‘time' in perspective, when Warner Bros. welcomed the Skydance pitch for Geostorm after Paramount passed, with Devlin directing and global Olympus Has Fallen star Gerard Butler attached, it was because the Burbank, CA. lot wanted to make a B-disaster film that had the potential to stoke a global audience. Geostorm centered around an international space station that is tasked with stopping a weather satellite meltdown as it causes deathly weather patterns around the globe (deserts freeze, tidal waves take out cities). At the time Warner Bros. agreed to Geostorm in the fall of 2014, it was moments before Devlin and Roland Emmerich agreed to make the sequel Independence Day: Resurgence at Fox, and it was roughly eight months prior to the release of New Line's San Andreas, which turned out to be a notable success, with a $474M global B.O. and an $88M profit. The town's mindset was that disaster films weren't necessarily dead yet.
.Warner Bros.' Wonder Woman is the 2nd highest film at the 2017 domestic B.O. with $412.5M. Warner Bros.
Typically, the easy go-to excuse for any studio is to blame a current bomb on a former studio chief. Despite the fact that Geostorm occurred under WB President of Creative Development and Worldwide Production Greg Silverman's watch, truth be told, greenlight decisions at Warner Bros. aren't made in a vacuum by one almighty lord. It takes a village, and there are a number of departments who have their say. Silverman, together with Skydance chief and Geostorm producer David Ellison, aimed to resuscitate Geostorm by calling in Jerry Bruckheimer for re-shoots. After the $175M costly King Arthur: The Legend of the Sword, Geostorm is Warner's second disaster this year. However, the studio is absolutely fine, as it leads all majors at the domestic B.O. with over $1.7 billion (+9% over the same Jan.-October 2016 period). In all fairness, Silverman can also share in the studio's annual B.O. success, as he was involved in Warner's blockbusters like Wonder Woman and Dunkirk, as well as its misses.
Dean Devlin, far right, directing on Geostorm. Warner Bros.
Riding herd over Devlin wasn't in the cards for Warner Bros. during production. Given that Skydance walked Geostorm in the door and had equity in the project, it was more appropriate to have them oversee Devlin. In sum, the general thinking among several executives at the time: Why even babysit Devlin? As a producer, he had an excellent track record delivering disaster genre films and event pictures directed by Roland Emmerich. Ellison and Devlin go way back: Devlin first cast Ellison a notable break as Eddie Beagle in the 2006 World War I pilot film Flyboys. Now Ellison in turn was producing Devlin's latest VFX spectacle. During Geostorm‘s production, Skydance was also busy with other projects like Terminator: Genisys and Star Trek Beyond. But even the best directors need sounding boards, and some sources tell us that Devlin was in over his head. It's akin to another story we heard on why Universal's The Mummy went sideways, which was a case of blockbuster screenwriter Alex Kurtzman getting bogged down with the directing reins on his first $100M-plus budgeted event film. In the case of Geostorm‘s unbuckling, we hear that Devlin was rushing to meet a deadline so the film could hit its first release date of March 25, 2016. There are others who contend that in the end, putting the onus on Devlin is completely uncalled for: It wasn't his movie in the end, rather a mess conjured up by too many cooks in the kitchen. Devlin did not have control over the characters who were cut out, those who were put in.
.Geostorm Warner Bros
Sources tell Deadline that the first cut shown to Warner Bros. studio executives was “unwatchable.” Geostorm spent 61 weeks in post, went through two composers, and was previewed three-to-four times before Silverman and Ellison phoned up Bruckheimer for help. Before Bruckheimer's team stepped in to clear up Geostorm, they reportedly wanted to make sure that Devlin was OK with their participation, given their respect for him. Devlin was scheduled to continue on to his next directorial, the thriller Bad Samaritan. Devlin welcomed Bruckheimer's help, and was privy to all the changes being made, including Danny Cannon's direction and Laeta Kalogridis' rewrites.
. Geostorm Warner Bros.
So what changed during Geostorm‘s reshoots? Dropping out expensive VFX scenes or adding them in wasn't on the table. Geostorm‘s problems were generally about storyline clarity, plot credibility, and characters' motivations. These were script problems that were hard to spot initially for Devlin's team, as they were in the weeds editing according to some. During the final edit, some characters dropped out. In earlier cuts prior to Bruckheimer, there would be situations where there was a dramatic scene in the film, but it was spoiled by a comedic score playing underneath. In addition to re-shoots and correcting music, Bruckheimer's team assisted in setting the film's color tone and finishing the VFX. Test scores shot up 15-20 points across various demos in the final edit. Silverman had already left Warner Bros. before the final cut was ready.
Independence Day: Resurgence 20th Century Fox
Still, disaster movies are on the wane at the box office. Similar to Fox with Independence Day: Resurgence, Warner Bros. shielded Geostorm from critics, so that any poor Rotten Tomatoes score wouldn't immediately impact word-of-mouth or tracking. In the past, studios like Paramount implemented such critic- sidestepping maneuvers to ensure solid openings for Cloverfield ($40M) and G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra ($54.7M). However, that's a challenging B.O. feat to pull off in these social media times. Resurgence‘s $41M start can be attributed to the fact that it wasn't original IP. The Rotten Tomatoes for Geostorm was 13%, lower than Resurgence‘s 31% Rotten, and other disaster pics like 2012 (39%). RelishMix already noticed the negative chatter about Geostorm in advance of its opening on social reporting: “Convo for Geostorm is decidedly mixed, tilting negative. Most moviegoers who took the time to comment compare the movie to other disaster films like Armageddon and Day After Tomorrow — even Independence Day.” Anecdotally, watching Geostorm, the VFX disaster scenes are actually the best part and are all-too- few. There's more talking going on as the characters strain to solve their problem. There's an attempt in the movie to hammer out a promising story between brothers (Butler and Jim Sturgess).”
Our finance experts believe that WB curbed on its global P&A spend with Geostorm, shelling out less than the typical $140M to launch an event film (San Andreas cost an estimated $110M in theatrical P&A). Our sources believe cash break-even for Geostorm is around $360M worldwide B.O., but insiders say it's less than $300M. With a $36.4M overseas weekend in 50 territories, and close to $64M worldwide to date, Geostorm won't profit and is bound to lose in excess of $100M, per our finance sources. Even if Geostorm rallies in China (Independence Day: Resurgence made $75M there), only 25% of the B.O. is coming to the states. Geostorm‘s red ink will be spread around to Skydance, WB and RatPac. The last time Skydance was in this financial and production pickle was with Paramount's World War Z, but they were able to save that movie, and get it to a half billion worldwide and near breakeven.
Pararmount
Geostorm over-indexed in the Southwest, which includes the Texas market, but under-indexed in the Southeast region, which includes Florida. In regard to under-indexed business in Houston — keep in mind that the Astros won the ALCS last night in a fierce game 7 against the New York Yankees, and are now on their way to the World Series. The west coast and Canada were Geostorm‘s best places of performance. It's funny, but the evidence was already out there for 14 years that Geostorm wouldn't click with audiences. In 2003, Paramount had the disaster movie The Core, starring Hilary Swank, Stanley Tucci, and Aaron Eckhart, with an uncredible plot that sounds a lot like Geostorm‘s. In the movie, an earthquake weapon device built by the U.S. government malfunctions and starts taking out cities. The earth's core stops spinning, thus causing radiation, and the only way to save it is for a team to drill down and restart the center of the earth with 1,000 megatons of nuclear weapons.
The Core opened during the final weekend of March that year to $12M — and there weren't any major natural disasters in the headlines.

It's 100 years since British passports first included photographs. How have they changed?
It can be a pain getting passport photos right. Smiling, frowning, hats (unless worn for religious reasons), leaning sideways, dark backgrounds, hair over eyes, red eye, glasses, sunglasses - there is a long list of no-nos. Anything wrong and Her Majesty's Passport Office may return the application.
But it hasn't always been like this. When the British government introduced passport photographs in February 1915, the rules were more lax. Whole families, rather than just one person, could be shown. As long as faces were visible, the pose and location of those involved did not matter.
Rather than sit in a booth as one would today, Sherlock Holmes author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in 1915, stood with his wife as his two sons sat in a dog cart.
A year later, Archbishop of Canterbury Randall Davidson appeared in his robes, crozier - the staff signalling care of his flock - in hand. The photograph was used for a passport allowing him to visit troops on the Western Front.
Image copyright Lambeth Palace Library Image caption Archbishop Davidson's passport for his visit to the front in May 1916
In France, where there was a similar lack of rules, a woman wore a hat looking like a dead pheasant. One mother and child were even photographed on the beach.
"Although photography had been around for more than half a century, its adoption seems to have caught the authorities by surprise," says Martin Lloyd, author of The Passport: The History of Man's Most Travelled Document. "They made no rules on how to pose for a picture. They were simply asked to send one in. So they did."
Image copyright Martin Lloyd Image caption French woman's passport photo with a pheasant-style hat
British passports came in the form of a foldable single sheet of paper. The individualism shown by applicants was perhaps a symptom of a longstanding aversion to officialdom. In 1835, Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston became embroiled in a row with the Belgian government, which had told him British passports should include physical descriptions of holders, such as height and eye colour. He refused, calling such requirements "degrading and offensive".
"He didn't want British people being perused by foreigners," says Lloyd, who worked as an immigration official for 25 years. "That situation continued until the beginning of World War One."
Other countries, including the US and France, started adding descriptions of people's physical characteristics during the 19th Century. By the time WW1 started in 1914, there were widespread fears of German spies operating in Britain, so the lack of a photograph or description on the country's passports came in for greater criticism.
Concerns increased following the capture and execution, in November 1914, of Carl Hans Lody, who had spied on Britain for Germany using a fake US passport. "They realised in Britain that the passport as it was not in fact identify the people," says Lloyd.
The British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act of 1914 made both a photograph and a personal description compulsory. Not all were happy with official amendments. Just a fortnight after the law came into force in 1915, the explorer and natural historian Bassett Digby wrote to the Times about the Foreign Office's "high-handed methods".
"On the form provided for the purpose I described my face as 'intelligent'," he complained. "Instead of finding this characterisation entered, I have received a passport on which some official, utterly unknown to me, has taken it upon himself to call my face 'oval'."
Image copyright Martin Lloyd Image caption Florence Varty, London 1915 and Ethel Homes, 1920 - cut from a group photograph
The passport, the first known English version of which dates back to the early 15th Century, had to be signed by the foreign secretary until 1857 and featured a printed signature afterwards.
A further change came in 1920, following a decision by the League of Nations to standardise passports. The blue cardboard-covered British booklet passport, the last of which expired in 2003, came into being. This was designed to prevent excessive folding of the single-sheet version, known to damage enamelled photographs.
By 1926, when the second version of the booklet passport was introduced, the requirement was for two duplicate, unmounted photographs printed on thin paper, "full face" showing, with no hats worn, which remains the norm. Pictures had to be a certain size to fit the box provided. This meant an end to the early free-for-all.
In 1941, the government specified the photograph size in inches, rather than just "small".
Image copyright Other Image caption Montage of Michael Pritchard's passport photos
Coin-operated photo booths, with origins as far back as the 1880s, came into wider usage in the 1950s, the same time as mass overseas tourism began, further homogenising passports.
"The very precise requirements of the Passport Office mean that passport photos are more standardised than they have ever been since 1915," says Michael Pritchard, director-general of the Royal Photographic Society. "No smiling, straight-on and white backgrounds don't provide the flattering images of the traditional High Street photographer and we've probably lost something, which is a shame, especially as we all have to live with that image for 10 years."
Smiling was banned in 2004, along with long fringes and dummies in babies' mouths. Today, passports, which come in the standard burgundy covers used within the European Union, must include colour photographs measuring 45mm by 35mm. There are more than 20 separate stipulations. Part of the reason is the introduction of biometrics - using the distances between facial features for more reliable identification - in 2006.
There is slightly more leeway for children, who have had to have passports separate from their parents since 1998. They can still smile, not having to adopt a "neutral" expression. Even so, it's a long way from the freedoms of 100 years ago.

Greece bailout: MPs vote to pass reform package as violent protest rages outside parliament
Updated
Greek MPs have passed controversial austerity laws aimed at paving the way for a European Union-backed bailout, following a late-night sitting in the Athens parliament.
The package, the harshest set of austerity measures ever introduced in the country, includes cuts to pensions and spending, sweeping changes to labour laws, and tax hikes.
The reforms are wildly unpopular among Greeks, who elected prime minister Alex Tsipras on an anti-austerity platform.
Protesters took to the streets of Athens ahead of the vote, with petrol bombs being hurled at police outside parliament.
Despite meeting international creditors' demands by pushing the unpopular measures through, the PM also suffered rebellion within his own party.
Thirty-two government members out of 149 voted against the package, and a further six abstained, meaning Mr Tsipras had to rely on the support of pro-European opposition parties.
A final count showed 229 MPs out of 300 voted in favour of the measures, with 64 voting against and six abstaining.
After the vote, Mr Tsipras said: "People need hope and prospect. [They] need opportunity."
ABC Europe correspondent Mary Gearin said the vote was likely to fuel anger on the streets of Greece.
"There are many people in Greece who feel betrayed by this government," she said.
The majority of Greeks voted against similar austerity terms in the referendum on July 5.
Ruling Syriza party fractured after vote divides members
The parliament was under pressure to pass the reforms after Greece struck an agreement with the eurozone to prevent it crashing out of the euro on Monday.
The vote followed a stormy debate in which dozens of government MPs on the left of the ruling Syriza party rebelled against Mr Tsipras and opposed the package.
Before the vote, Mr Tsipras urged parliament to back the bailout saying: "We don't believe in it but we are forced to adopt it."
Former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who branded the bailout deal "a new Versailles treaty", voted against the new laws.
Energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis and deputy labour minister Dimitris Stratoulis also voted against the package.
Amid speculation both ministers could lose their jobs in a reshuffle, possibly as early as Thursday, Mr Lafazanis said he remained loyal to the government but was ready to offer his resignation, joining deputy finance minister Nadia Valavani, who stepped down earlier.
"We support Syriza in government and we support the prime minister. We don't support the bailout," Mr Lafazanis said after the vote.
Fellow government member and speaker of the parliament Zoe Constantopoulou branded the measures "social genocide".
Greece's new finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, said during the debate that his decision to back the bailout terms was something that "will burden me my whole life".
"I don't know if we did the right thing. I do know we did something we felt we had no choice over," he said.
Eurozone finance ministers to discuss vote, next steps
The result opens the way for talks on a third bailout to begin with European partners, but leaves the future of the Tsipras government unclear following the split in his party ranks.
With parliamentary approval secured, the way has also been cleared for the release of funding to allow Greek banks to reopen, more than two weeks after capital controls were imposed to prevent them from collapsing.
Eurozone finance ministers were due to hold a conference call to discuss the vote.
With Greece facing an urgent deadline on July 20, when a 3.5 billion euro payment to the European Central Bank is due, EU officials were racing to agree to a bridge financing accord that would enable Athens to avoid defaulting on the loan.
Despite strong objections from Britain and the Czech Republic — EU countries that do not use the euro — a 7 billion euro loan is expected to be extended to Greece from the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM), an EU-wide fund not intended for eurozone funding needs.
Given the hurdles facing the agreement, doubts have surfaced about how long it could hold together, with one senior EU official saying it had a "20, maybe 30 per cent chance of success".

Our dog is having a really bad weekend. He didn't do anything wrong but he had a displeasing event last night that has left him a psychological mess. Maybe with time he can get over this event but at the moment it's not looking good.
It started with a sheep. Not the entire sheep of course, but just the part that the butcher gave us to put on the spit.
If you ever cook meat on a split you'll notice that after a while all the men at the party tend to move towards the spit, and just stand in silence as the hypnotic effect of rotating meat transforms their mood into reflective bliss.
If it does this for a group of adult men then just think for a moment about what that does to a Golden Retriever?
I could actually see his head slowly move around in a small circle as the meat turned on the spit. I don't think he actually believed what he was seeing, how could such a beautiful thing actually exist in real life and not just an idea in the deepest part of a dogs fantasies?
He sat there for longer than I thought possible just looking at the meat, but you could see it in his eyes that he knew this was an experience that he could only look at and never actually taste. Then we had a moment, from across the room. He looked at me then back to the meat. I shook my head at him, I knew what he was thinking and he knew that I just refused his request.
His disappointment was real and obvious so he walked away defeated. For the rest of the evening he avoided the spit in much the same way every girl avoided me during our High School Social many years ago, but unlike me I assumed he'll get over it.
Later in the evening we put some more meat on the grill and he walked over again. Just look at the photo, you can see it in his eyes that he knows it's unattainable despite its geographic closeness and even running around the backyard like a moron didn't help him get over the experience that he'll never have.
He seems ok today, I tried talking to him about what happened last night but he just changes the subject and only wants to talk about simpler things such as tennis balls and fetching sticks.
I better go vegetarian for a while and see if that makes him get over his melancholy.
Coinbase has just rolled out full support for Litecoin, its third cryptocurrency.
Users will be able to buy, sell, send and store Litecoin from Coinbase's website or mobile apps, using easy payment methods like a credit/debit card or PayPal.
While Coinbase was founded as a platform to transact only with Bitcoin, the company has since announced its intent to add other cryptocurrencies with the broader goal of becoming a “digital currency company.”
Four years in the making
Last summer Coinbase added support for Ethereum, which is now the second most-popular digital currency with a market cap about one-third the size of Bitcoin's market cap. At the time, the reasoning was that Coinbase saw Ethereum's focus on smart contracts as a tangible improvement over Bitcoin, and not just another alt-coin that doesn't serve any real function.
So why Litecoin? Interestingly, Litecoin's creator, Charlie Lee, has been director of engineering at Coinbase for nearly four years. And while there were always ongoing discussions about adding Litecoin to the platform, they didn't really materialize until recently.
Lee explained that it's been a slow few years for Litecoin. While the digital currency had a heyday in late 2013 with its price spiking to over $50 per coin and over $1 billion in total market cap, it quickly fell back to earth and basically remained flat for three years.
So why the sudden change?
If you're familiar with Bitcoin you know that the community is facing an internal struggle with deciding how to scale the currency for the future. Essentially, Bitcoin's original code wasn't designed to process this many transactions on a daily basis, and now the network is charging too much per transaction, which takes too long to confirm.
Luckily there are two main proposed solutions: Bitcoin Unlimited, which aims to get rid of the block size limit altogether, and Segregated Witness (SegWit), which wants to slightly increase the block size while also moving some non-essential data out of the transaction and off the blockchain.
Both solutions would require a “fork,” meaning the majority of miners would have to agree on the changes and signal to slightly alter the currency's blockchain. So far the Bitcoin community has been unable to reach a consensus on how to fix the scaling issue.
SegWit
A few months ago Lee and the Litecoin community decided to work on implementing SegWit into Litecoin. And after heated discussions with the biggest players in the Litecoin mining community, the group reached consensus about a week ago to implement SegWit. Last week, miners “voted” with their hash power to signal for SegWit, and the actual code will be implemented next week.
While Litecoin is still small enough that it's not suffering from the same scaling issues as is Bitcoin, the team thought it'd be a good way to bring something exciting to Litecoin.
Plus, SegWit has some other benefits besides just increasing network capacity. It prevents malleability, which is essentially the risk (that currently exists in Bitcoin) that third parties can alter transactions before they are confirmed by the network. Implementing SegWit will also allow Litecoin to experiment with something called Lightening Networks — which would essentially allow for instant Litecoin payments off the main blockchain, with transactions only settling on the chain when they need to.
And perhaps best of all, these recent developments have rekindled interest in the Litecoin currency, sending the price (and more importantly, volume) skyrocketing. This increased trading volume is what finally allowed Coinbase to implement Litecoin, knowing they now have a liquid enough market (on the Coinbase-owned exchange GDAX) to supply user demand.
Long-term Litecoin
Essentially, Lee sees Litecoin's long-term goal as being able to help Bitcoin alleviate some transactional volume by taking over smaller, less important transactions. So you could use Lightening Networks on Litecoin to buy a coffee with zero confirmation times or transaction fees. But if you're wiring $50,000 to your bank, you could still use Bitcoin for the increased security that comes from a bigger network of decentralized miners.
He also sees Litecoin as a testing ground for future Bitcoin features. If Litecoin can successfully implement SegWit and Lightning Networks, it may show the Bitcoin community that these features are clearly the way to once and for all resolve the capacity issue.

IOTA/USD is expected to break out of the symmetrical triangle after twelve days ranging from the all-time high of $5.58 to $3.00.
Objective
Today's objective is to introduce another unique cryptocurrency asset which was ignored and under evaluated for so long.
Fundamental analysis
Advertisement
What is IOTA and why you may consider investing?
“The main innovation behind IOTA is the Tangle, a revolutionary new block less distributed ledger which is scalable, lightweight and for the first time ever makes it possible to transfer value without any fees. Contrary to today's Block chains, consensus is no-longer decoupled but instead an intrinsic part of the system, leading to decentralized and self-regulating peer-to-peer network.”
Transfer value without fees. What? That cannot be true, or is it? BTC already has insane transaction fees so how can another cryptocurrency achieve this and be the only one in the space to do so? I'm not going to go deeper into what Tangle is or how it works since it is not the purpose of this article, instead, if you are interested in this technology, please take some time and read the Whitepaper from here:
https://iota.org/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf.
Past performance
IOTA has been trading for some time, and till recently, it has been largely ignored. Let's take a look at IOTA/USD 1D time frame.
On the left-hand side, we have a previous market cycle performance of this asset where it achieved the all-time high price of $1.10. Quite modest performance, giving the potential of this technology.
On the right-hand side, we have the current performance with the uptrend swing about to make another big move with the temporary all-time high at $5.58.
At first glance, the previous performance looks like a small hill than a giant mountain. The current price is five times higher and we are only on the fourth wave which we will discuss more later.
Tip: Plan your trades before pulling the trigger.
Current performance
Looking at below 4 hours chart the breakout is imminent, and it comes with a very know pattern: Symmetrical triangle.
The idea in this pattern is that price will range between some upper and lower boundaries until it finds an equilibrium, formed by two intersecting trendlines of similar slope converging at a point called the apex. The statistics shows us that for such a pattern the profit target is almost the same height as the triangle itself. Looking at our chart we calculated the Trend Base Fibonacci Extension and we got $7 as the possible target. Not bad is it? The loss/reword ration is 3:1. The stop loss could be placed at $3.40 which is also a fractal level.
How confident are we to say that the breakout is going to continue the uptrend and not going to be another bull trap.? Well, looking at the two-hour chart using the Ichimoku system, we can see that we have the Tenka-sen and Kijun-sen crossing over with Tenka-sen above Kijun-sen which is a bullish signal. The MACD indicator just crossed towards the positive values which supports upper movement. The RSI is not giving us the best signal, since it is about 60 which indicates that soon the price is going to become oversold, This can indicate that a correction is about to occur soon.
Tip: A fractal is a recurring pattern that can predict reversals. A bearish turning point occurs when there is a pattern with the highest high in the middle and two lower highs on each side. A bullish turning point occurs when there is a pattern with the lowest low in the middle and two higher lows on each side.
Future performance
What can we expect to happen next with the price of IOTA? Let's find out from the below chart:
By studying the charts, we can see that the price is moving in so-called waves. This was first described by Ralph Nelson Elliott (1871–1948). Market prices alternate between an impulsive, or motive phase, and a corrective phase on all time scales of the trend. What does this mean for us? As we have seen at smaller scales, every upswing has a price correction, and when volatility is too high, the same happens on a bigger scale. After the price reaches a certain value, a correction must happen before the next uptrend starts.
We describe the bigger scale market cycle as a cycle composed of 5 waves. As we can see from above chart, not long ago the fifth wave started. You may think that the last wave is the longest, but this is not true every time, and statistically the third wave is shown to be the longest.
Tip: Stop overtrading. Don't pick tops. Manage your trades with no regrets.
Key areas to watch for:
the red line resistance as profit taking targets
a strong continuation move to the upside tomorrow and break of the resistance at $4.25
Tenka-sen and Kijun-sen crossing over for an uptrend run confirmation
Near-term resistance at $4.75, $4.95, $5.15 and $5.55.
Those interested in picking up a position in POWR may consider buying at $4.25 or wait for a 50% – 60% correction and buy after consolidation.
METALLICA drummer Lars Ulrich says that he might consider returning to his native Denmark if Donald Trump wins the U.S. presidential election.
Speaking with Denmark's Ekstra Bladet, Lars — who moved to the U.S. in 1980, when he was only 17 years old — said (translated from Danish): "I am a hundred percent Danish citizen, I pay taxes in the USA but I can't vote in America."
Asked whether he would move back to Denmark if Trump gets in the White House, Ulrich replied: "Yes, certainly sometimes I think about moving home to Denmark.
"I'll stick to my Danish passport. If Trump becomes president and everything goes to shit, I might make my way to the airport and ask if I can get back in again."
METALLICA frontman James Hetfield said in a recent interview with BBC 6 Music that his band stays away from topics like politics or religion in their music. He explained: "That just seems to polarize people even more. We all have our own beliefs, but at the end of the day, we're trying to connect with people and it seems like political views don't do that as much as music does."
In 2007, Why Democracy?, a documentary project using film to start a global conversation about democracy, posted a video interview with Ulrich in which he was asked whom he would want to be the "President of the World." Ulrich replied: "I want the smartest guy, and the smartest guy is Bill Clinton, so Bill Clinton should be the president of the world, absolutely."
"Hardwired...To Self-Destruct", METALLICA's tenth studio album, is set to come out on November 18.
METALLICA plans extensive touring in 2017 behind the new album but will next perform at Neil Young's Bridge School Benefit in Mountain View, California on October 22 and October 23.
Half-life was fuming. He'd just read an article claiming that the 1st Arrondissement in Paris was the best neighbourhood in the world, just ahead of Harajuku, Tokyo. He was so cross he ordered another pint before telling the barman:
‘I'm not paying for that.'
It was a classic Half-life manoeuvre when trying to ingratiate himself with nervous new staff.
“I-I'll have to get the manager.'
‘Go get him. He should be grateful I drink in this shithole. Get the manager. Get the Feds. Get Linda fucking Lovelace for all I care, pal.'
Half-life was drinking with a seen-it-all, know-it-all regular, Fuckit McCabe, who he despised but tolerated when there was no one else to talk at. Fuckit had added to his ire by agreeing that the magazine was wrong, but contending that Shoreditch was the greatest neighbourhood in the world.
‘That's it. Put it on this cunt's tab,' Half-life told the barman.
‘Fuck it,' shrugged Fuckit.
Half-life knows Paris well. A girlfriend regularly transports him there so he can show Parisian waiters the true art of rudeness. He's got love for Paris. But, he argues, the best neighbourhoods in the world are La Boca, in South-east Buenos Aires and Waterloo, in South-east London.
Waterloo is where Half-life first landed in London, making a clean break from prison, arriving with just the clothes on his back, a handgun, a brick of hash and a note from his doctor. He kindly agreed to show me his Waterloo, at my expense.
Half-life's First XI
Half-life's First XI were the first eleven pubs he visited on his first day in the Smoke. They all got the ‘I'm not paying for that,' treatment and those that passed the test have benefitted from his custom ever since. He was barred from two of them within a week and remains on probation at the rest of them, most of the time.
Just as he had done that first day, we went in the Lord Nelson first. At a pub sitting at the bottom of a council estate, he figured he'd be able to buy and sell drugs and let the local faces know he was not be fucked with. What he got was one of London's kookiest boozers, with great music, good food and people so nice he didn't want to fall out with them or stab them. It became his local; the doorstep you don't shit on.
I remembered the Nelson for its response to the horse meat lasagna scandal. With meat from Borough Market, they served up Super-Injuction 8oz Horse Burgers, or as Half-life called them, ‘Taboo and chips'.
I'm somewhat drawn to estate pubs. There's often some magic in the grimness, but The Nelson shows that estate pubs don't have to be grim. They can be colourful and energetic.
From there we went to The Ring, on the corner of Blackfriars Bridge Road. ‘Ah. Famous for it's rich fight history, of course,' I said, dully.
‘I don't know about rich, but it's where I lamped Benny The Egg for taking libs with Kinky Rose,' came the reply. Half-life, while he can be the bane of a barmaid, could also be their protector if someone, other than himself, is out of order.
We were still working on our appetite, so we agreed to come back to The Cut on Sunday for The Anchor & Hope's legendary 7-hour lamb shoulder and press on to Pub No. 4. The Windmill is a relaxed but lively pre- and post-theatre boozer near the Young Vic that doubles as a sports pub. There we watched Australian wickets tumble like drunk skittles, while Half-life asked a big-boned nodding acquaintance how his latest fad diet was going.
‘Wide!' Half-life then bellowed, around seven times an over.
Next, we had the pleasure of being served by actual antipodeans at the Stage Door, an unpretentious pub behind the Old Vic with a surprising roof terrace that also showed the continuing Ashes massacre. The staff were noticeably efficient and good humoured, even as Half-life told them:
‘Here, I know one Aussie who's not out: Rolf Harris.'
Mind you, they were probably Kiwis.
Going slightly off the plan, we tried to check out The Pit Bar, the basement boozerie at the Old Vic, only to find it, not only closed, but likely to remain so for a few weeks. Shame, as it was going to be our after hours stop, now that Da Vinci's, the ‘anything goes' bar with the 23-hour licence, has been torn down, to be replaced by unlicensed flats and offices.
It's hard to imagine that the Old Vic, the theatre on The Cut that housed the greatest dramatic talent of the past century, was in danger of becoming a bingo hall or a themed pub in 1998. In 2004 Ben Whishaw followed Gielgud, Olivier, Burton, Guinness, Redgrave, O'Toole and Jacobi in playing Hamlet there. Half-life blagged a review ticket for the extraordinary performance.
‘Unforgettable, mate. I had the Circle Bar to myself for three hours, apart from half-time.'
They had no ale on at our next stop, the delightful step back in time that is the Duke Of Sussex. It's had the same landlord for 31 years and hasn't changed in that time. He's either brilliant or bone idle. We made do with a very good Guinness in the sun trap tables outside, while Half-life congratulated himself for remembering to drink an iron supplement today.
‘It's balls that,' I told him. ‘You'd have to drink three pints of Guinness to get as much iron as there is in an egg.'
‘Maybe so, but who in their right mind would choose the egg?' he replied.
It was about time we skinned up so we went to the Waterloo Millennium Green, the tiny adjacent park, where couples were already enjoying a spliff in the sun, as toddlers chased pigeons in a scene of urban serenity. The effect on visual perception was soon evident as Half-life stared back at the pub, over a tiny slope and through a few trees:
‘Where else can you gaze across a mountain and a forest and see a beautiful pub?'
No wonder he thinks Waterloo is a world beater.
Half-life then got a business call that required him to make a delivery to North Lambeth. I went with him as far as Lower Marsh and popped into the Scooter Caffé for a reviving Sierra Nevada in the dark, dreamy downstairs room. On another table sat two stylish, attractive women in eye-catching retro clobber, who matched the decor and sounds. I made contact. I got a laugh. Then Half-life came down, spilling a Negroni, and walked into the toilet, without shutting the door or the curtain and proceeded to relieve himself while shouting above the music:
‘Here, do you reckon I can get penile reduction surgery on the NHS?'
We left.
Now we were in peak condition, it was time to go to the pub. And what a pub. The Kings Arms in Roupell Street is a dream of a boozer (as previously mentioned in Arts Holes) in a beautiful, unspoilt Georgian terraced street (see main pic). Originally worker's cottages, built in the 1820s, 2-bedroom Roupell St houses are now worth seven figures. One went for £1.15million in 2014, five times what houses were worth there in 1998. Sod the property though, it's the pub, its two bars and eight pumps that's the draw. And it's not this living film set that makes Waterloo what it is, it's the abundant social housing that stop it filling up with twunts.
It's always worth getting to the King's Arms early as in summer it gets packed, and in winter you want the top table by the log fire. It's a year-round friend.
To complement his iron intake at the Duke, Half-life drank two pints of Plum Porter, claiming it was the most delicious way to take vitamins since Chucklehead cider came in 4-pint cartons. But once the suits arrived and started spilling out all over the road, it was time to go to a less popular watering hole.
We liked the Rose & Crown for its garden, where you can smoke a doobie and play: ‘You're Going To Marry The Next Girl Who Walks Past.'
Most people turned off the path before the pub, but occasionally they kept going and forced us into disastrous imaginary matrimony. As it started to rain, Half-life placed a jacket over a puddle for an unimpressed nurse. My jacket.
The weed had stolen Half-life's hunger again, which was annoying because I was skungry for tapas at the excellent Meson Don Felipe, or nibbles in the eateries of Isabella Street. But Half-life is from the ‘eating is cheating' school.
We were due to visit the Prince Albert next but despite the landlord barring Half-life, it has not survived and is to be demolished and replaced by a hotel. One down out of eleven isn't bad in this climate, though.
So we went to The White Hart for one, a funky little backstreet boozer on Cornwall Road, where I had to separate Half-life from somebody else's girlfriend before the boyfriend figured out what ‘Me cago en tus muertos' meant (I shit on your dead). We swiftly headed towards the Hole In The Wall by Waterloo Station. En route I spotted some lads disappearing into an arch.
‘What's that?' I asked.
‘That's Pleasuredrome. It's one of them saunas. Licensed. Open 24/7, 365 days a year.'
‘Handy if you're bored on Christmas Day,' I offered.
‘Or would like to be.'
Onward we strode to our tailender then, Pub No. 11, The Hole In The Wall – a truly grubby pub in a railway arch by Waterloo Station, but one of my favourite grubby pubs. The front bar feels like a railway station waiting room, which in a way, it is. The back room is larger, has Sky Sports and leads to a ‘garden' where you can watch analogue TV whilst having a smoke and meeting the happily transient.
It's also a bit smelly and the toilets are pretty hideous. All in all, ten out of ten.
At this point, we were in a pretty shabby state ourselves, but you can't do Waterloo without visiting one of the greatest centre of arts and culture in Europe: The South Bank.
The list of notables who have performed or shown work at the National Theatre, the Royal Festival Hall, the Queen Elizabeth Hall, Purcell Rooms, the Hayward Gallery and BFI is endless and even thinking about it makes me tired and humble. Thankfully, all of these venerable institutions have bars – and many of them, balconies. We'd missed the 2-for-1 happy hour (4-7pm) at Concrete by just four hours, so we headed the Baylis Terrace at the NT with some awfully cheap, awful wine, bought from the Market Express, a nearby convenience store with outside seating (the place to go if you've ever wondered what it would be like to have a date at a Costcutter).
The changes on the Baylis Terrace blew Half-life's tiny mind. Garden furniture and long grasses? Yes, it looked nice, but what's wrong with barren Brutalism on an exposed, hard-to-find balcony in the drizzle? The old benches have been shoved round the corner, so they don't get the river view, but they do get a bit of privacy, which, in the middle of London, is highly valued. Now they overlook the IMAX roundabout where, as the Dulwich Raider told us, you can watch ‘giant shit films.'
It wasn't the same without gazing at water though, so with the tide out, we went to Gabriel's Wharf, its wooden shacks now ghostly and its beach deserted, for one last blaze. The view of the city from the water level is special. Like you're inside it, seeing London in its grundies.
By now we had run out of words and I was ravenously hungry. All the best restaurants were closed, but there was one more Waterloo delight: The Waterloo Grill, formerly Jimmy's Tea Bar, and open 24/7. It's near where Great Train Robber Buster Edwards had his flower stall. One night, the actor Dexter Fletcher nicked two bunches of nasturtiums from him and Edwards called the law, appalled by criminality as he was.
Next to the redoubtable Grill, a utility company's metal cupboard accidentally provided the best table in town, tucked under the railway bridge. Desperately, I scoffed an egg burger, with ketchup, yoke and fat dribbling down my chins.
‘Heaven,' I gasped.
‘Guinness dodger,' chided Half-life, as he disappeared into the night.
Update, October 2016:
The Duke of Sussex has changed hands and entered the 21st century. It is now a gastropub with craft beer and everything but still with its cracking outside space.
Word reaches us that the Charles Dickens on Union St is to reopen under the stewarship of the team behind the Kings Arms in Roupell St, which can only be a very good thing.

Important Information
Let me set the scene; it's 11pm and the Triple-C Racing boys had just arrived in Amsterdam, NY. After checking into a dumpy motel, we set off in search of a hoon-able empty lot. We were drawn, almost magnetically, towards a large multilevel parking garage.
It was totally empty, save for this decrepit S-Class. The car looked like someone just parked it and walked away. Or stole it, parked it, and walked away. So many questions; how long has it been there, who's it registered to, and are they dead?
Sitting on the floor with a deflated air suspension, it looked like the car had a good bit of mold growing inside, but the tires still had air. There's a certain beauty to decomposition, and this S-Class quite perfectly encapsulates that aesthetic.

The Harper government's recent bid to give police more information about Internet users would have unlocked numerous revealing personal details — from web-surfing habits to names of friends, says a new study by the federal privacy watchdog.
The online surveillance bill was effectively a digital key to determining someone's leanings, the people they know and where they travel, says the office of Privacy Commissioner Jennifer Stoddart.
"What's more, each of these pieces of information can be used to uncover further information about an individual," concludes the study.
"As information technologies become more and more common in our lives, and the more they become an extension of our very selves, the more sensitive and revealing subscriber identification information becomes."
The Conservative government abandoned the legislation in February following a public outcry.
The bill would have allowed police, intelligence agents and competition bureau officers access to Internet subscriber information — including name, address, telephone number, email address and Internet Protocol (IP) address — without a warrant.
Currently, the release of such data held by Internet service providers is voluntary.
Privacy concerns
Opponents of the bill said allowing authorities access to Internet subscriber information without a court-approved warrant would be a worrisome erosion of privacy because even that limited data can help paint a candid picture.
The federal government, on the other hand, likened the information in question to a listing in a public phone book.
The privacy commissioner's study, initiated while the bill was still before Parliament, says the government's characterization "grossly misconstrues and underestimates" what can be gleaned from the data with a bit of additional effort.
"In general, the findings lead to the conclusion that, unlike simple phone book information, the elements examined can be used to develop very detailed portraits of individuals providing insight into one's activities, tastes, leanings and lives."
Assistant privacy commissioner Chantal Bernier said Canadians are protective about their Internet activities.
"We should be extremely careful about granting unwarranted access about basic subscriber information," she said Wednesday in an interview.
"The challenge is to ensure privacy on the Internet while at the same time not creating a space for anonymity for criminals."
Study compares online data to phone book
In its study, the privacy commissioner's office focused on elements covered by the bill which are not found in a phone book — email address, mobile phone number and IP address, the numerical sequence assigned to an online device.
Taking the actual mobile phone number of a staff member in the privacy commissioner's office, the researchers used commonly available Internet tools such as search engines to reveal the individual's full name, their phone service provider, two personal web sites and their domain registrations, an affiliation with a university and contributions to online discussion forums.
Similar to a phone number, an email address can lead to a variety of information about someone, says the study, including friends on social network services and previous employers.
An IP address can help divulge someone's personal interests and even point to their physical location, the privacy commissioner added.
A service provider may assign a temporary IP address to a computer for anywhere from a few days to a few months, notes the study.
The authors looked at one IP address shown by Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia site, to reveal that the person behind the address had edited hundreds of entries about television shows and history topics, taken part in a discussion board about a TV channel and visited a site devoted to sexual preferences.
The study points to the case of David Petraeus, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency director who resigned over revelation of an extramarital affair. His indiscretions came to light after the Federal Bureau of Investigation used IP addresses to trace harassing emails his mistress had sent to another woman.
In dropping the online surveillance bill, Justice Minister Rob Nicholson said the government would not include mandatory disclosure of basic subscriber information in future revisions of the Criminal Code.
Bernier said while she hopes the study's findings turn out to be moot, the privacy commissioner's office has received no direct assurances about the federal legislative intentions.
"We really have no idea, we have had no communication about that one way or another."
How the company, and Ms. Bresch, strikes that balance seems to be quickly changing. Generic drug companies once dealt almost exclusively in making cheap copies of pills and railed passionately against the anticompetitive tactics of brand-name competitors. Now, through a series of acquisitions and mergers, the handful of large generic companies that are left are increasingly investing in expensive brand-name drugs, and in doing so, are embracing many of the tactics they once scorned.
“It's like talking out of both sides of your mouth,” said Dinesh Thakur, an advocate for generic drug quality. “To me, I think, it's opportunistic.”
In the interview, Ms. Bresch said the company's latest actions would do the most to help patients where it mattered, by reducing their out-of-pocket costs. And she said that the $600 list price was necessary for the company to recoup its investment in the EpiPen, which includes raising awareness for severe allergic reaction and making improvements to the way the product works.
But she also sought to shift blame away from Mylan, saying that patients are feeling the pain in part because insurers have increased the amount that customers must pay in recent years.
“What else do you shop for that when you walk up to the counter, you have no idea what it's going to cost you?” she said. “Tell me where that happens anywhere else in the system. It's unconscionable.”
To some, the company's response seemed to ring hollow. “It's a real challenge to understand how a management team sits around a board table and makes a decision to raise the price of a lifesaving medication over and over and over, and when the P.R. storm hits, decides to blame someone else for that price increase,” said David Maris, an analyst for Wells Fargo. He had warned investors in June that Mylan's price increases on EpiPen and other drugs could soon draw unwanted media scrutiny.
The company is not a stranger to controversy. Robert J. Coury, Mylan's chairman who served as chief executive until 2011, came under scrutiny in 2012 for using the company's corporate jet to travel to his son's music concerts. And last year, The Wall Street Journal reported that one of the board members had undisclosed ties to the land where the company built its new Pittsburgh offices.
Anyone who really wants to get the country back from the grim reaper now in charge of Canada would look to the NDP as their best hope. Anyone who knows this nation's political history is aware the NDP is the only party that is not completely in the pocket of big business and the political elite and that also has a chance of making a difference in Parliament. A lot of people want to believe the NDP can actually make a difference.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners ‘Punch to the Gut' Musical on Residential Schools Returns to Vancouver Children of God has been shaped by intense audience reactions, says director Corey Payette.
Regrettably the party and its leader Tom Mulcair aren't making it easy -- which is why fewer people support the NDP now than they did three years ago or even last year. A fundraising letter that arrived last week shows why. The envelope declares "Are you ready to elect Canada's first NDP government?" No one outside the confines of the NDP's castle-under-siege actually believes this is remotely possible and that can't help but have an impact on the party's credibility. If the party and its leader are so disconnected from political reality that they think they are going to double their current 20 per cent support in the polls by October, then how can we trust them to be connected with us regarding a vision for the future?
The party and its brain trust drank the "we are going to win" Kool-Aid under Jack Layton and they're still drinking it.
Don't misunderstand me here. Of course parties run to win. They run to persuade people that they are the best bet for making the country a better place.
But you can run to win without appearing delusional. That means running on a platform that connects intimately with your constituents' deeply held values. A platform which also addresses their fears -- manufactured fears generated by Stephen Harper (terrorism and crime) and real fears about what he will do with the country if he gets four more years.
Must have: NDP-Liberal coalition/accord
Success for the NDP must also mean dealing intelligently with the reality of the first-past-the-post system. That means grasping that the best way -- perhaps the only way -- for the NDP to "govern" is to be part of a coalition/accord with the Liberals.
At this point at least such co-operation seems like a very faint hope.
The Liberals and NDP hate each other even more, it seems, than they hate the Harper Conservatives. That puts them off side with all those Canadians whose singular political desire is to rid the country of Harper and his wrecking crew.
As a friend commented to me the other day, the closer the NDP comes to the Liberals in its policies (now offering tax cuts to small business without a shred of evidence that this would create jobs) the more determined it becomes to have nothing to do with some kind of agreement that could get rid of Harper.
Unless something changes, come election time there will be two battles: the Harper Conservatives will be running to win, and the NDP and Liberals will be fighting their own private war. It is a recipe for disaster for the country.
The conversations that lead the NDP to this apparent abandonment of the country's best interests clearly take place strictly within the confines of the party bureaucracy. Because if the party's brainiacs actually talked to its supporters, members and progressive Canadians in general, it would know just how terrified people are of the prospect of another Harper majority.
The divide between the NDP leadership's thinking and the political sentiment of its potential supporters has never been greater. This disturbing disconnect suggests that unlike the majority of Canadians who are almost paralyzed by fear and loathing regarding the future of their country, those who run the NDP simply aren't driven by the same fear. Effectively, they care more about their party than they do about their country. It begs the question of whether a progressive party can even make a legitimate claim to the title if the people who run it actually care less about their country than the average citizen does.
Status quo Trudeau
Of course the same and worse can be said of the Liberals but nothing more can be expected of them. They are a party of big business, committed to the (ever-worsening) status quo with a long history of appealing to Canadians progressive instincts during elections while dutifully serving the interests of the economic elite. The classic example, of course, was the Liberal Red Book of promises waved ceremoniously at every rally by Jean Chrétien in the 1993 election. It was beyond cynical that not a single one of the promises was ever kept. Instead Paul Martin distinguished the Chrétien government with two record-breaking accomplishments: the largest cuts to social spending (40 per cent) in Canadian history and the largest tax cuts ($100 billion over five years) in history. Yes, larger tax cuts than Jim Flaherty's.
But this doesn't mean that these two parties, despite their different histories, cultures and loyalties, could not form some kind of alliance to stop the bleeding. It is done all the time in Europe where nominally strange governing coalitions are formed all the time. Perhaps the best example is the recent victory of the left-wing Syriza party in Greece. It rejected any governing alliance with the fatally compromised old-left parties and teamed up with a right-wing party which agreed with its position opposing the "austerity waterboarding" imposed by the European Union and IMF.
Greece faces a historic crisis that called for an extraordinary political response. It can be argued that Canada faces a historic crisis as well: the threat of providing Stephen Harper with four more years. These are decidedly not normal times. For the first time in our history we actually have a government that is committed to dismantling the best aspects of our country.
That cries out for an extraordinary response. And if the NDP can't propose an accord of some kind based on principle (let's see if the Liberals have the jam to refuse) then why not do it based on opportunism? It would hardly be a departure given its myriad compromises over the years (and its opportunistic defeat of the Liberals in 2006, handing Harper power). Oddly, the NDP claims to want power yet demonstrates with its intransigence on co-operation with the Liberals that it is not actually serious.
It is obvious to all progressive Canadians that if either the Liberals or the Conservatives win a majority the country is in deep trouble. The Liberals will not commit themselves to reversing all the damage done by Harper. They are interested in power for the sake of it and would happily administer the status quo inherited from the Conservatives.
Aim for a minority government
Our only hope is a minority government. If the Conservatives win the Liberals and the NDP must be prepared -- and say so -- to force a vote of non-confidence in the government and form a new government based on a limited number of initiatives. If the Liberals win a plurality the same holds true: co-operation has to be on the table as part of the election.
But if the NDP, in its preoccupation with competing with the Liberals to "win" the election, gets closer and closer to their policies, its risks giving the Liberals a majority.
So far, the NDP are a mixed bag on the policy front. They propose good stuff like the $15 minimum wage, child care, proportional representation and protecting medicare funding. But they are extremely weak on the economy, as evidenced by the party's pandering to small business, refusing to tax wealth and lack of a clear industrial development strategy.
The economy will be the defining issue in October and the NDP has the opportunity, given the rapidly deteriorating economic situation, to dramatically distinguish itself from the other parties. But so far it has been unable to escape the economic policy straitjacket it placed on itself decades ago. Time is running out.
It's running out, too, for getting Canadians accustomed to the idea that a coalition is the best way to save the country.
Judy Higley-Zuehlke reads a statement to Judge Michael West shortly before her sentencing Thursday morning in 31st Circuit Court in Port Huron. She was convicted in October of second-degree murder in the death of her former boyfriend, John Allen. The 44-year-old woman also was convicted of lying to a peace officer during a violent crime investigation, concealing the death of an individual, and tampering with evidence. (Photo: MARK R. RUMMEL , TIMES HERALD )
Dressed in orange and wearing shackles, a 44-year-old Port Huron woman convicted of killing her ex-boyfriend maintained her innocence at her sentencing.
"To the Allen family and my family also and all those that knew and loved J.R., I am heartily sorry for our loss," Judy Higley-Zuehlke said in St. Clair County Circuit Judge Michael West's courtroom Thursday.
"…The assumption that I could hurt anyone, especially J.R., is ridiculous."
Higley-Zuehlke will serve 28 to 55 years in prison for the killing of 50-year-old John Robert Allen.
Allen's brother found him dead in his St. Clair Street home Feb. 3.
Medical Examiner Dr. Daniel Spitz testified the cause of Allen's death was strangulation with contributory factors of a puncture wound to the ear and blunt force trauma injuries to the head.
At the sentencing, Assistant Prosecutor Amy Stover said Allen had 35 additional injuries besides the three that caused his death.
"Three different ways that Mr. Allen could have died, but that wasn't enough," Stover said.
A jury of 12 in early October found Higley-Zuehlke guilty of second-degree murder, lying to a peace officer during a violent crime investigation, concealing the death of an individual and tampering with evidence.
The judge sentenced Higley-Zuehlke to:
• Two to four years for count one, lying to a peace officer during a violent crime investigation, with credit for 274 days served.
• Three to five years for count two, concealing the death of an individual, with credit for 274 days served.
• Five to 10 years for count three, tampering with evidence, with credit for 274 days served.
• Twenty-five to 50 years for count four, second-degree murder, with credit for 274 days served.
Counts two and four are to be served consecutively, making HIgley-Zuehlke's total sentence 28 to 55 years in prison. Counts one and three are to be served concurrently.
"We all strive for an ability to sit back and say justice has been served," West said, during the sentencing. "I think, in this case, that is something we can all say."
Stover read a statement from the Allen family during the sentencing. She said the family was traumatized by the "senseless act of violence."
"We will always wonder why Miss Higley-Zuehlke felt compelled to commit this horrible crime," Stover read from the statement. "Some family members cry, some have sleepless nights…"
Higley-Zuehlke's lawyer, Sharon Parrish, said Higley-Zuehlke maintains her innocence and will be appealing.
"Please do not take my life away for this — in which I did not do — and I will plead my innocence," Higley-Zuehlke said, during the sentencing.
Carol Wetzel and Sally Finch, former coworkers and friends of Allen, attended the sentencing Thursday.
"Tears just came down my face when they gave her the sentence for second-degree murder," Wetzel said, outside the courthouse. "…I kept telling him, 'Keep her away, don't let her in your house.'"
Finch said the sentencing gave her some closure.
"It's justice for John," Finch said. "He didn't deserve what was done to him."

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Footage has emerged of Paul Nicholls being rescued
British actor Paul Nicholls has been rescued after being trapped at the bottom of a waterfall in Thailand for three days, his agent has said.
The ex-EastEnders star had motorcycled to the site in Koh Samui before falling, breaking both legs and shattering a knee.
He was unable to use his phone after it broke, but local villagers alerted police to his abandoned motorbike.
The 38-year-old Bolton-born actor's agent said he was "recovering well".
Nicholls will be flown back to the UK next week.
The actor, who played Joe Wicks on the BBC soap in the 1990s, was on holiday in Thailand after finishing filming for the Channel 4 series Ackley Bridge.
After being alerted, police searched records to find out who had rented the bike and found it had been rented to a British tourist called Paul Greenhalgh - Nicholls' real name.
Volunteer rescuers, police, and medics went to search for the actor, and found him several hours after setting off.
Image caption Mr Nicholls came to prominence in long-running BBC soap EastEnders
Nicholls' first TV appearance was aged 10 in Granada Television show Children's Ward.
His EastEnders character Joe Wicks lived with schizophrenia, and the popular soap was praised for its portrayal of mental health on-screen.
Since EastEnders, Nicholls has appeared in a number of TV shows, including Law and Order UK, Casualty, and Grantchester.
His most recent TV appearance is in Channel 4's Ackley Bridge, where he plays a teacher in a school where British Asian and white British communities merge.
Today, Apple's Tim Cook posted a letter announcing a new security page on the company's website, publishing some fairly plain-language security talk.
There's some solid language here that is clearly designed to allay fears about the way that Apple protects user data in the wake of the celebrity nude hacking incidents.
Cook's words:
We believe in telling you up front exactly what's going to happen to your personal information and asking for your permission before you share it with us. And if you change your mind later, we make it easy to stop sharing with us. Every Apple product is designed around those principles. When we do ask to use your data, it's to provide you with a better user experience. We're publishing this website to explain how we handle your personal information, what we do and don't collect, and why. We're going to make sure you get updates here about privacy at Apple at least once a year and whenever there are significant changes to our policies.
It's a welcome statement, exactly the kind of thing I was talking about when I said more transparency from Apple is needed when it comes to security. It's known for its clear communication of product benefits, so why not security?
The addition of a security page that will be continuously updated with current information about the way that Apple handles user data is a great forward step here.
Cook also takes the opportunity to plainly state (again) that Apple has never worked ‘with governments' to create service backdoors.
Finally, I want to be absolutely clear that we have never worked with any government agency from any country to create a backdoor in any of our products or services. We have also never allowed access to our servers. And we never will.
Apple also provided a new guide for law enforcement in the US that says it can no longer decrypt user devices. Previously, law enforcement could request decryption in order to retrieve evidence. Apple says it has changed its encryption method in iOS 8 so this is no longer technically possible.
For all devices running iOS 8.0 and later versions, Apple will no longer be performing iOS data extractions as the data sought will be encrypted and Apple will not possess the encryption key.
I'm optimistic about its ability to follow on from this with more action on the security front. I'd love to see a bug bounty program, either public or selective, that allowed third-party researchers a strong conduit for communication and vulnerability reporting, for instance. Until Apple embraces external researchers it will remain vulnerable as its products swell to include millions of lines of code and multiple surfaces for malicious entities to attack. More eyeballs on the problem is a good thing.
But the letter is a good signal, and it's more forthcoming than many of Apple's competitors. Cook doesn't hesitate to point out, of course, that Apple's business model allows it to take this ‘we don't want your information' stance.
Still, Apple is an enormous corporation, looking to protect its interests just like any other. So I don't doubt that many will view this as a sort of damage control (and it is) to protect Apple's reputation.
But I also personally know many Apple employees at many levels of the company from engineers to managers — and I can tell you, for what it's worth — that this is what they really believe. They work at Apple because they make products that will affect the lives of millions and they believe (in general) in its ethos and ethics. Many certainly don't (just) do it for the paycheck.
I don't know whether these sentiments are shared among Apple's executive staff — I don't have brunch with Tim Cook or anything — but I would hope that it is.
Apple is a corporation, let's not forget, so it pays to be watchful and to hold it to a high standard when it comes to security and privacy. There's no need to make it concessions or ‘forgive' it for mistakes. And the Snowden revelations have shown us that sometimes the best intentions of any company or set of executives isn't enough to protect users — inside the US or not.
Still, better to have it out in the open, so kudos.
“Rules are not the enemy of markets,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren told me yesterday, on the heels of her major address on the unfinished business of financial reform at the Levy Institute's Hyman Minsky Conference. “Rules promote innovation and competition. Rules prevent markets from blowing up. We learned that in 1929 and we should have learned it again in 2008.”
That comment captures what distinguishes Warren from so many of her congressional and political colleagues. Any lawmaker can create a laundry list, and in her Minsky speech Warren did some of that, presenting specific steps needed to bolster financial regulation, which in its current state still puts the country at risk. But Warren has garnered attention because she actually has a worldview for how to best structure the economy, one which has become impossible for any Democrat, even the former Secretary of State winding through our nation's Chipotles, to ignore.
Related: Why Elizabeth Warren Trumps Obama's Economic Message
Warren's governing philosophy can be boiled down to one simple sentiment: Actions must have consequences. The way to build functioning markets is to lay out ground rules and actually hold market participants accountable to them. That allows everyone in a market the same set of chances to succeed if they can attract enough customers. “This is about building competitive capitalism instead of crony capitalism,” Warren told me.
In terms of financial regulation, that means that institutions must be punished for breaking the rules. And it means that taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for the risks of those institutions, because they must not be rewarded for failure. “Everything else flows from these two principles,” Warren said, arguing for a principles-based approach to smarter, simpler regulations.
You can very easily expand that out. If a retailer sells a defective mattress that falls apart when you lay on it, the customer should be able to get their money back. If the oil industry gets special subsidies not offered to other firms in the energy space, they're gaining an unfair advantage in the market. If an auto dealer quotes you one price for a car, and then comes back and raises it, the purchaser should have recourse to claim unfair practices. (In fact, one of Warren's recommendations was to extend Consumer Financial Protection Bureau oversight to auto dealers, who are currently carved out under Dodd-Frank.)

In other words, Warren's agenda isn't the result of some narrowly focused monomania about financial institutions. It's about making the economy work, in a way that it hasn't for the past 40 years. And it's rooted in this principle that rules are necessary for healthy markets.
This is actually a pretty conservative viewpoint, in the small-c sense of the word. Lack of bailout protection should lead to conservatism, or prudence, in risk-taking. You can find plenty of conservative treatises on free market discipline, or the idea that punishment deters crime. There's obviously room within this worldview for a safety net for individuals. But this vision takes as much cruelty out of market-based capitalism as possible.
Each item in Warren's laundry list fits into this coherent framework about actions and consequences. Closing the auto dealer loophole would let CFPB treat their unlawful actions the same way as other consumer products. That also goes for extending the regulatory perimeter to cover non-bank financial institutions known as “shadow banks,” which issue short-term debt without scrutiny from regulators. Breaking up big banks helps prevent any unfair advantages through “too big to fail” status, instead forcing companies that get into trouble to face the consequences. Limiting emergency Federal Reserve lending, the beating heart of the bailout, forces companies to reckon with failure without a lifeline. Warren even implicates the tax code for discouraging companies from being well-capitalized so they can absorb losses when they make mistakes.
The agenda only works if officials are willing to actually enforce the rules. That's where Warren directed her most critical comments on Wednesday. “The Department of Justice doesn't take big financial institutions to trial — ever — even when financial institutions engage in blatantly criminal activity.” If rules are essential to markets, then allowing rules to be broken destroys them.

Warren suggested several fixes. She would weed out deferred prosecution agreements (or their cousins, non-prosecution agreements), which give slaps on the wrist to financial miscreants. Any firm settling wrongdoing should have to pay a “mandatory minimum” equal to at least all of the profits obtained from the illegal activity (“if that's controversial, shows there are real problems on Wall Street,” Warren noted). And judges should be granted more power to review settlements. This part of the agenda could be accomplished without Congress, Warren pointed out. “There are many things regulatory agencies can and should do, starting now.”
I asked Warren about the so-called “Arthur Andersen” defense, that there are collateral consequences to taking down big firms, and that settlements which don't implicate innocent bystanders are more appropriate. “How come that doesn't apply to small banks?” she asked, referring to small fry prosecutions like Freedom Bank in Oklahoma. “Why is it when a small bank violates the law, no there's no hesitation to take them down, close the bank, fire the management team and put employees on the street?” Again, it's this issue of clear and consistent rules for everyone that Warren wants to institute.
She also questioned the unconscious bias written into the collateral consequences argument: “You ask about the collateral consequences of enforcing the law, what about the collateral consequences of not enforcing law?” Certainly, when actions have no consequences, the result is more actions that profit from law-breaking, and a market based on how expertly you can deceive.
The simplicity of this framework, along with its universal grounding in firmly held values, has made it difficult to characterize as wild-eyed liberal screeds, no matter how hard industry mouthpieces try. That gives Warren's views power, and you can see that in how Hillary Clinton wants to align herself with them, whether through laying on the praise in a Time magazine profile or hiring campaign staff with a track record on financial reform, like former Commodity Futures Trading Commission chief Gary Gensler.
Related: Why Marco Rubio Might Just Beat Hillary Clinton
What is so far mimicry (which the financial industry has discounted, for what it's worth) needs to be accompanied by a broad articulation of an actual governing philosophy. “What I did was lay out the structural approach,” Warren said. That's what people are responding to. They don't want to know what you're for; they want to know who you are.
Top Reads from The Fiscal Times:
Canada's change of government this week, after a decade of conservative rule, could see Ottawa swiftly exit the multinational F-35 programme and instead pursue a fighter competition, which defence analysts suggest could favour the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet or F-15SE, or Dassault's Rafale.
The incoming Liberal Party has pledged to ditch Lockheed Martin's F-35 and “immediately” launch a competition to replace the Royal Canadian Air Force's 77 active Boeing CF-18s, following years of indecision. The new government is also withdrawing the service's six fighters, one tanker and two surveillance aircraft from the US-led air campaign in Iraq, and is de-emphasising the service's expeditionary combat role in preference of homeland defence and air patrol.
Withdrawing from the F-35 programme is the first step in what some say will be a wider rationalisation and recalibration of military spending, similar to the UK's Strategic Defence and Security Review of 2010. Buying a less expensive, off-the-shelf fighter primarily for the air interdiction and patrol role, instead of the F-35, would free up the air force's procurement allocation, allowing it to explore other much-needed platform recapitalisations, such as of its Airbus A310 tanker/transports and Lockheed CP-140 maritime patrol aircraft, says Michel Merluzeau, vice-president for aerospace strategy at Frost & Sullivan.
Canada could even invest in airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) and surveillance platforms, such as the Boeing 737-based E-7 or Northrop Grumman E-2D Hawkeye. The latter company's RQ-4 Global Hawk unmanned air vehicle might even be examined for long-range surveillance.
“The Arctic mission is primordial,” says Merluzeau, who previously worked for Public Works and Government Services Canada on the F-35 analysis of alternatives. “Consequently, the Artic mission goes beyond tactical air missions. You have to look into a series of capabilities that involves more than a single-engine aircraft: intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, electronic warfare, tankers.
“I don't think Canada can honestly say they're competitive with just an F-35 to conduct those missions over the Artic. The relevance of Canada would get a serious boost from this decision, because you'll have a more self-deployable and self-capable force.”
Canada's CF-18s were procured form 1982 to 1988 and are being life-extended to 2025
Royal Canadian Air Force
Boeing's Super Hornet is the natural fit to replace the CF-18 over the F-35, says Merluzeau, but for Artic patrol missions the F-15SE and Rafale would excel. Choosing France's Rafale would be a departure from Canada's long-standing preference of US equipment. However, Dassault's “trump card” could be to build the fighter in Canada.
“Beyond three aircraft per month, Dassault has got to tool up,” says Merluzeau. “It would be difficult for Boeing to say ‘we'll assemble the F/A-18s in Canada', considering the problems in St Louis right now” – where both the F/A-18 and F-15 are assembled. Merluzeau does not rate the Eurofighter Typhoon and Saab Gripen's chances, despite the considerable capabilities of both aircraft.
David Perry, senior defence analyst for the Canadian Global Affairs Institute, says a procurement of 65 Lightning IIs is not affordable, and would require “some accounting jujitsu” to fit within Canada's limited defence budget.
The conventional take-off and landing F-35A costs just under $100 million, but there is also the lesser known cost of basing, training and long-term support and maintenance. Canada spends just over $18 billion annually on defence, and the budget is due to grow by 3% annually starting in 2017.
Perry says the CF-18 replacement project hasn't moved forward an inch since 2012, and even took a step backwards to the “options analysis phase”. The previous government has bought some time by life-extending the "Classic" Hornet to 2025, but the new administration must move quickly to get a replacement in line.
Perry says he does not expect a serious impact to Canada's aerospace industry by withdrawing from the F-35 programme. Statements by Lockheed and Pentagon officials indicate that Canadian suppliers will continue to supply parts, although they would be likely to miss out on future sustainment work.
Lockheed also is competing for a “substantial contract” to provide the combat system for on the new Canadian Surface Combatant, Perry adds.
“In the past in Canada, there have been companies that engaged in scorched earth tactics if they had unfavourable outcomes on programmes. I think this would be a very different scenario, because [F-35] is not the only game in town.”
Fabio Casartelli (16 August 1970 – 18 July 1995) was an Italian cyclist and an Olympic gold medalist who died in a crash on the descent of the Col de Portet d'Aspet, France, during the 15th stage of the 1995 Tour de France.[1]
He was born in Como, Italy.
Amateur career [ edit ]
Fabio Casartelli showed great promise as an amateur. He had many important wins and placings between 1990 and 1992, climaxing in winning a gold medal in the 1992 Summer Olympics road race. He finished the 194 km race in 4:35:21, a second ahead of Erik Dekker of the Netherlands and 3 ahead of Dainis Ozols of Latvia.

Professional career [ edit ]
Casartelli began his professional career in 1993 with the Ariostea team. He won a stage in the Settimana Bergamasca race, came second in a stage of the Tour de Suisse and finished the Giro d'Italia. In 1994 he moved to ZG-Mobili. For his third professional year, he moved to Team Motorola. He placed sixth in the Spanish Clásica de Almería and third in the second stage of the Spanish Tour of Murcia. Casartelli was selected to represent his team for the 1995 Tour de France along with Alvaro Mejia, Frankie Andreu, Lance Armstrong, Steve Bauer, Kaspars Ozers, Andrea Peron, Steve Swart and Sean Yates.

Death [ edit ]
The monument to Fabio Casartelli
On 18 July, during the fifteenth stage of the 1995 Tour de France, Casartelli and a few other riders crashed on the descent of the Col de Portet d'Aspet in the Pyrenees. Casartelli's head struck the concrete blocks along the roadway, causing severe head injuries and loss of consciousness. Doctors arrived within ten seconds.[2] While being flown to a local hospital by helicopter, Casartelli stopped breathing and after numerous resuscitation attempts he was declared dead. It has been argued that Casartelli would have survived if he had been wearing a bicycle helmet.[3] Gerard Porte, the Tour's senior doctor, claimed that protection was academic since the fatal blow was to an area of Casartelli's head that would not have been covered by a helmet.[3] However Michel Disteldorf, the French doctor who examined Casartelli's body on behalf of the coroner in Tarbes, where the rider was flown by helicopter after he crashed, told the Sunday Times that the point of impact was on the top of the skull, and that had Casartelli been wearing a hard helmet "some injuries could have been avoided".[4]
His Motorola team continued the Tour de France, crossing the finish line of the next stage first, side by side in Pau. The peloton followed behind, riding slowly. The Société du Tour de France awarded the stage prizes as normal, and the riders donated all the money won that day to a fund established for his family. The Tour later matched that amount, and thousands of individuals contributed to the fund.
Three days after the accident Fabio Casartelli's teammate Lance Armstrong dedicated his stage finish to Casartelli by pointing at the sky as he rode over the finish line.[5]
The Société du Tour de France and the Motorola team placed a memorial near where he crashed, situated at co-ordinates (42.940, 0.819). The memorial is a sundial arranged such that the sun's shadow highlights three dates — his birth and death and 2 August, the day he won his Olympic gold medal. The bicycle he was riding at the time of his fatal crash was placed in the chapel at the Madonna del Ghisallo, a church and museum to cyclists near his home.
In 1997, the young rider classification in the Tour de France was renamed "Souvenir Fabio Casartelli" in his honour.

Saudi Arabia's Royal Drug Problem
A Saudi prince and four others were reportedly arrested in Lebanon Monday after authorities found more than two tons of illegal drugs, including cocaine and the amphetamine Captagon, in crates loaded onto a Saudi-bound jet.
But if history is any indication of his fate, the unidentified member of the royal family may be let off the hook if he can find his way home, where other members of his sprawling family tree have previously avoided international accusations of drug smuggling under protection in Riyadh.
In 1999, Saudi Prince Nayef bin Sultan bin Fawwaz al-Shaalan allegedly smuggled two tons of cocaine from Venezuela to France. Now believed to be living under legal shelter in Saudi Arabia, Prince Nayef was accused by France of using his diplomatic status to sneak the drugs onto a jet belonging to the Saudi royal family. He managed to escape his sentencing and was convicted in absentia in 2007. The United States also indicted him with conspiracy to distribute cocaine.
In 2010, a leaked WikiLeaks cable described a royal underground party scene in Jeddah that was “thriving and throbbing” because Saudi officials looked the other way. The dispatch described a Halloween party, funded in part by a prince from the Thunayan family, where more than 150 young men and women dressed in costumes and slogged expensive alcohol, which is sold only on the black market in Saudi Arabia. “Though not witnessed directly at this event, cocaine and hashish use is common in these social circles,” the cable read.
The harsh punishments for violations of Saudi Arabia's interpretation of sharia law tend not to apply to some 15,000 princes and princesses who belong to the royal House of Saud. But that hasn't stopped Riyadh from pursuing executions of foreigners and non-royal citizens accused of less egregious violations of the country's drug laws.
In recent months, Saudi authorities have beheaded a number of people convicted of trafficking drugs, including two Pakistani men — one in June and one in August — despite calls for reconsideration by human rights groups and the Pakistani government.
Captagon pills are at the heart of the conflict in Syria, where their trade reportedly generates millions of dollars in revenue and helps fuel fighters addicted to the drugs. Monday's drug bust — one of the largest at the airport in Lebanese history — is just the latest incident in what has been an embarrassing month for the Saudi royal family.
In late September, Prince Majed Abdulaziz al-Saud was arrested after a female worker accused him of abusing her at the home he rented in Beverly Hills. Last week, further details about the abuse emerged after an amended complaint filed by three female house workers accused Prince Majed of intense emotional and sexual abuse.
Last week's civil lawsuit was filed after the Los Angeles county district attorney's office declined to file earlier felony charges against the 29-year-old prince, citing insufficient evidence.
According to court documents, the prince threatened to kill the three women, shouting, “I am a prince, and I do what I want! You are nobody!”
According to the civil complaint, the young royal also performed gay sex acts, which, like drug charges, are punishable by death in Saudi Arabia.
If found liable, Prince Majed may not be able to rely on his royal status for exemption in the United States. In 2010, Prince Saud bin Abdulaziz bin Nasir al-Saud was sentenced to life in prison in the United Kingdom after killing his servant at a hotel in London and is expected to serve at least 20 years for his murder.
The justice who issued the sentence told the prince he wouldn't be let off the hook just because he is royalty.
“It would be wrong for me to sentence you either more severely or more leniently because of your membership of the Saudi royal family,” Justice David Bean said at the time.
But the prince was transferred home in 2013 to serve the remainder of his sentence there and has thus far escaped the death penalty.

Anderson Silva speaks during a press conference for UFC 162 on June 12 at X-Gym on in Rio de Janeiro. (Photo: Buda Mendes, Getty Images) Story Highlights A looming potential superfight could happen if Silva beat Chris Weidman at UFC 162
Silva: 'I'm not scared of Jon Jones, or Chris Weidman or whoever'
One day after telling a group of reporters that he didn't think he could beat Jon Jones, UFC middleweight champ Anderson Silva is apparently doing a bit of an about face.
With a looming potential superfight on the horizon with UFC light heavyweight champ Jones, Silva wanted to make it perfectly clear that he's not intimated by the bigger man.
GAME OVER?: Fighters pick against Anderson Silva
"My opinion is this: I'll fight Jon Jones, all the guys from my class, all the guys that work in the UFC – all the fighters," Silva said on Tuesday's new edition of UFC Tonight. "I respect all the fighters. I respect Jon Jones. I respect Chris Weidman, but I'm here for working.
"I'm not scared of Jon Jones, or Chris Weidman or whoever. I'm here to fight. That's it. It's simple."
Silva, of course, is booked in the main event of Saturday night's UFC 162 event at Las Vegas' MGM Grand Garden Arena, where he takes on undefeated challenger Weidman. As you would expect of a fighter who is 16-0 in the octagon, Silva is the betting favorite in the matchup.
However, Weidman's skillset has made him a fashionable underdog pick, even among UFC veterans, including UFC Tonight hosts Chael Sonnen and Kenny Florian.
Silva said that's just fine with him.
"It's a great fight on Saturday night because Weidman has good jiu-jitsu, good wrestling, good standup," Silva said. "It's a great fight."
For Weidman, UFC 162 represents what is unquestionably the biggest fight of his career. But there may be much on the line for Silva, as well, as UFC President Dana White has suggested a win will put "The Spider" in a superfight with either Jones or UFC welterweight champ Georges St-Pierre.
Silva remained coy when asked what victory could bring.
"I don't know," Silva said. "I have my plans in my class. I don't have a big goal to change my class. I have my belt in my class. I have my story in my class. That's it."
It's just the latest smoke screen from Silva, who never seems to answer things with a response that doesn't take a little bit of deciphering. If you believe White, it's all part of the middleweight champ's master plan to confuse the media, quite possibly just for his own entertainment.
Whatever the reason, Silva isn't tipping his hand just yet.
"I respect all the fighters," Silva said. "I respect Georges St-Pierre because Georges has a great story in the UFC. I respect all the fighters in here because this is the biggest sport in the world.
"This is the UFC. UFC has the best fighters in the world. That's it."

During an investigation of California Rep. Duncan Hunter's campaign expenses, the House Office of Congressional Ethics allegedly uncovered that the Republican lawmaker had used $600 in campaign funds to cover airfare expenses for his family's rabbit.
According to a report from the Associated Press, Hunter's office said this week the Office of Congressional Ethics would be disclosing the expenses for his pet, calling it an example of over-reach by the agency.
“[The office] has in their report $600 in campaign expenditures for in-cabin rabbit transport fees,” said Joe Kasper, a spokesman for Hunter. “Since travel is often done on [airline] miles — which is entirely permissible — the credit card connected to the account was charged several times even when his children were flying.”

Hunter has reimbursed his campaign about $49,000 after a review said expenses were described as inappropriate or made in error. Those expenses included charges for groceries, fast food and items from a trip Hunter took to Italy.
Use of campaign funds for personal benefit is illegal.
“This was nothing more than an oversight. In fact, it's such an obvious example of a mistake being made, but [the office] wants to view it through a lens of possible intent. The same goes for many other expenditures,” Kasper said. “Many of Rep. Hunter's repayments had to do with mistakes under specific circumstances, and in other cases there were bona fide campaign activities connected to expenditures that [the office] was not aware of and didn't account for.”
Hunter has said some of the mischarges were because the campaign card looked similar to his personal credit card.
Earlier this week, GOP lawmakers considered gutting the Office of Congressional Ethics until the move was the subject of widespread backlash from constituents and criticized by President-elect Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE.
Kasper defended the changes, telling the Associated Press, "concerns are strong enough that it nearly prompted a significant structural change."
Could South America end its participation in the war on drugs? Fears horrific human cost of tackling cartels will lead to change in policy
Latin American countries could stop deploying law enforcement agencies
'Gamechanging' report on global drugs policy released
Almost all cocaine consumed in West is produced in Latin America
Report advocates for softer policies toward drug users
Latin American countries could stop deploying law enforcement agencies to fight cartels after concluding that the human costs of the 'war on drugs' is just too high.
That is just one of the scenarios envisaged in a 'gamechanging' report on global drugs policy released by the Organisation of American States.
Commissioned at last year's Cartagena Summit of the Americas the report calls for a discussion in decriminalization of drug use and for greater coordination between nations in tackling the scourge.
Game-changer: Latin American countries could stop deploying law enforcement agencies to fight cartels after concluding that the human costs of the 'war on drugs' is just too high
Many in Latin America feel a new approach is needed to the drug war - and a shift away from hard-line policies - after decades of violence in producer and trafficking nations such as Colombia, Peru and Mexico.
Some regional leaders are pressuring the United States for an overhaul of anti-drug policies and have suggested they might be open to legalisation of some narcotics if that helped reduce violence.
The 200 page review references a number of South American countries would break with the prohibition line and decide that they will no longer deploy law enforcement and the army against drug cartels after deeming the human cost of life too high.
'The report presented by the OAS today is a vital piece in the construction of a common way to fight this problem,' Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said during the presentation.
Battle: Earlier this month Obama defended his administration's efforts to stem U.S. demand for drugs that many regional leaders see as a driving factor in their security issues
LATIN AMERICA'S LOSING BATTLE WITH DRUGS
Latin America suffers the brunt of consequences of the drug war. Keeping track of the drug deaths is difficult, as official figures have been issued sporadically but in Mexico alone, upwards of 70,000 people have died in drug-related violence over the past six years.
The government stresses that Mexico's murder rate is still lower than several nations, including Honduras, Guatemala, Brazil and Venezuela. Drug-related violence has plagued Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador as traffickers have increasingly infiltrated Central America. Almost all the cocaine consumed in Western countries is produced in Latin America, while violence linked to the drug trade kills thousands every year as smugglers fight for control of trafficking routes in Central America, Colombia and Mexico.
Drug consumption is ticking up in nations such as Argentina and Brazil.
According to the OAS, about 45 percent of cocaine consumers, 50 percent of heroine users and 25 percent of marijuana smokers live in North and South America. While many people in Central America are also weary of the focus on the drug-fuelled violence, it remains an undeniable part of daily life in many parts of the region.
Costa Rica has fared better than many of its neighbors, but it worries about spillover from nearby countries. Honduras, for example, now has the highest homicide rate in the world, with about 7,200 people murdered last year in the tiny nation of 8 million people, most in drug-related crime.
Almost all the cocaine consumed in Western countries is produced in Latin America, while violence linked to the drug trade kills thousands every year as smugglers fight for control of trafficking routes in Central America, Colombia and Mexico.
Drug consumption is ticking up in nations such as Argentina and Brazil.
According to the OAS, about 45 percent of cocaine consumers, 50 percent of heroine users and 25 percent of marijuana smokers live in North and South America.
The report for the OAS, which includes all 35 North and South American nations, aims to start a debate among American nations regarding anti-drug policies. It also advocates for softer policies toward drug users.
'The decriminalization of drug consumption must be considered the base of any public health strategies,' the report says. 'An addict is not a person with a chronic disease that should be punished for his addiction.'
The report echoes comments by Helen Clark, the head of the U.N. Development Program, who in March said she favored Latin American governments treating drugs as a public health problem.
It also calls for 'a substantial reduction in penalties' to drug addicts and urges countries in the region to opt for rehabilitation programs instead. It suggests that countries in the region should consider the option of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana consumption.
'Our report, however, did not find any significant support, in any of the countries, toward the decriminalization or legalization of any other illegal drug,' the OAS said.
The United States has sent billions of dollars to Colombia to combat the cocaine trade but still there is limited coordinated effort between countries in fighting drug trafficking and usage.
That prompted several member presidents to ask the OAS to analyze the region's anti-drug policies in order to make them more effective
Failing: Federal police in a drugs bust in Mexico City.
The Open Society Foundations, a human-rights and pro-democracy group, celebrated the report as a 'game changing' document that likely will broaden the debate on drug policy reform.
'This is the beginning of an international conversation on a new approach to drugs,' said David Holiday, the group's senior regional advocacy officer.
With only 3 weeks left in the year, I am simultaneously trying to get ready for the holidays, finishing up one of my jobs, make sure I am covered for taxes in 2007, and prepping for what I am going to do with my finances comes January 1. So while trying to think about all these different things, I started wondering what I had wasted money on during this past year…and figured I would share so you could too! (Don't be shy, none of us know who you are!) I will go first – in no particular order, here are some thing that come to mind that I probably should not have bought or paid for this year:
Another year of .Mac service – I can build my own web pages, I have my own backup service, and I don't sync my computers anymore. So what exactly do I need this for? Who knows, but I paid for it anyway. – $79.95
Without noticing, SmugMug charged me for another year of photo storage – even though I have not accessed the account in about 8 months. I forgot I even had an account there, as I use Flickr to store my photos now. So I went ahead and closed the account, but not before they kept my $29.95.
Seeing as how I work from home now, I don't exactly use my cell phone much anymore. When I used to actually go outside for extended periods of time, I used a program called Vindigo in my Treo 650 to find restaurants, gas stations, etc. Well – it's another one of those automatic renewals that I did not notice in time…costing me another $29.95.
Although I did my best to avoid doing so, we bought too much coffee outside out of the house this year. It's a problem, believe me. Cost: Who the hell knows, but a lot.
What the heck did I need another Swiss Army Knife for? Really? I didn't, not at all. In fact, I have several of them, but this one was on sale! Into the emergency kit it goes, so my wife and I will be armed to the teeth with small knives in case the SHTF! Cost: $25.
I bought the most expensive toaster/convection oven ever. I am a firm believer in buying the best you can afford, as hopefully as it will last longer and need less fixing them some cheapo version of something – but sometimes this gets the better of me and cons me into thinking that I need more than I really do. Thus, we have a super-duper toaster oven that toasts 6 pieces of bread at one, can cook pizzas and chickens just the same, and takes up 51% of the kitchen space. Cost: Too frickin much.
So this brings me back to you…what did you buy this year that you wish you hadn't? What did you spend money on that now, looking back, seems like a waste of your hard earned money. Come on, you can share here!

Trish would be among 250,000 unwed mothers of the "white stolen generation" in Australia. The young women were drugged, tethered to beds, and never allowed to see their babies. It was a practice which has been described as 'institutionalised baby farming', whereby babies born to unwed women were forcibly taken from them and illegally adopted to infertile couples. This was the accepted practice at the RBH for up to five decades from the 1930s. As she prepares to celebrate Christmas with her family tomorrow, Trish remembers a time when her family was incomplete.
“The nurse told me I was unfit to be a mother ... that I didn't deserve to see my son,” she said. “My son was whisked away out of the delivery room and I was taken to an unmarried mothers' ward in the hospital. At five o'clock I asked the nurse for the final time when my son would arrive. She turned to me and said: 'Your son is gone. He's already gone with his adoptive parents'. “I demanded every day to see my son ... for every day that I was in that ward.” However Trish, at 20 years old with no family for support, was no match for the system.
“The next day my milk came flooding in. So they forced me to wear an extremely tight elastic bandage that covered my entire chest right down to my hips," she said. “It was so tight I could barely breathe. “They also gave me the drug stilboestrol to dry my milk, but it also made me very calm and very quiet, just as they wanted me.” Trish has since learned the drug is used to treat incontinent female dogs. “The next morning a social worker came in and demanded that I sign an adoption form. When I refused she told me I would be charged with 'seduction' and deported back to England and never allowed in the country again with no chance to see my son,” she said.
The same happened the following morning, and the following. Finally, the seemingly exacerbated social worker told Trish she could sign a hospital release form and take her son home. “I was so excited. I thought I had won. I thought I had beat them at their own game,” she said. “The social worker came with some forms on a clip board and I signed them. Then I sat on my bed and waited and waited for them to bring me my son. “I sat there until they put another woman in my bed.
“At five o'clock I asked the nurse for the final time when my son would arrive. “She turned to me and said: 'Your son is gone. He's already gone with his adoptive parents'.” The following morning Trish – now a desperate mother – went to the Department of Child Services seeking help. Her plight fell on deaf ears. “So I marched right to the police station on Roma Street and told them my baby had been stolen from me," she said. “The policeman at the desk said he would need some proof that I had in fact had a baby.
“So I went back to the Royal Brisbane Hospital. I said to the woman at reception, 'I had a baby here, I would like my records'. I gave her me name. “She said, 'Are you sure you had a baby in this hospital?' “She said there was absolutely no record of me ever having been admitted to the hospital. And there was no record of my baby being born.” Two years earlier Margaret Hamilton, now 64, delivered her son in the same ward. “But I have absolutely no memory of giving birth. I have no idea how my son came into this world,” she said.
“Perhaps it was such a traumatic experience I blocked it out ... perhaps I was drugged. “I was 19 years old. I was engaged and pregnant, but my fiancé called it off. I was to be a single mother, so I went where all single mothers went ... to a home.” There, Margaret lived with 50 other young women, all pregnant and unmarried. “No one asked me what I wanted to do,” she said. On May 11, 1966 Margaret was admitted to hospital.
“I was left on a bed in a corridor. I heard another woman scream and I thought, 'Oh I don't want to be like that',” she said. Then nothing. “My friends tell me I must have had such a traumatic experience there I have blocked it out. But I can't imagine I would do that,” Margaret said. “It's not unlikely I was drugged, but I have no medical records.” Like Trish, Margaret was forced to sign adoption papers, but not before she caught a glimpse of her son in the hospital nursery.
“Yes, I saw him through the window ... but I was never allowed to hold him, or touch him,” she said. “The adoption was illegal. I was only 19. It was not legal for a woman to consent to adoption until they were 21. “My son was stolen from me.” Once Margaret signed the adoption papers she was told she needed to leave the hospital. “I was expected to return home, return to my job and never speak of it again,” Margaret said.
“I couldn't do that.” In the weeks following the birth Margaret became increasingly depressed. “I didn't care whether I lived or died,” she said. “I would walk across the road without looking, hoping a car would hit me.” Eventually Margaret could not bear her life in Brisbane.
“The streets were too familiar. Not only had I been abandoned by the man I loved, I had lost my child.” Margaret moved to Melbourne where she regained some semblance of a normal life. It was not until she returned to Brisbane, married and with two children, in 1990 that she once again yearned for her lost son. “I wasn't coping. I had to find him,” she said. Margaret, like Trish, found an ally in ALAS Queensland – Adoption Loss Adult Support – for mothers searching for their lost children.
One year later Margaret saw her son again for the first time. “He was not the baby I saw in the hospital. He was a man. He was 25 years old,” she said. The pair met at a country fair in regional New South Wales. “There were people everywhere and I was so scared I would miss him," she said. “Then I saw a man walking across a field. I recognised him by his walk. He has the walk of my family.”
There for the very first time Margaret held her son. Margaret and Trish are among the fortunate few who have been reunited with their children, but their grief for the babies they lost has never faded. “The grief never goes away. Adoption is a life sentence,” Margaret said. She finds comfort remembering walking the streets of Brisbane's CBD when she was pregnant. “I loved being pregnant, because then my baby was mine and no one could take it from me," Margaret said.
“I love my son, but I still grieve for my baby.” For this, a formal apology from the federal government is crucial. Margaret made a personal request to Prime Minister Julia Gillard at a community cabinet meeting at Clontarf, north of Brisbane, last month. "My name is Margaret Hamilton," she began. "I'm from ALAS - Adoption Loss Adult Support. There are over 250,000 white mothers who lost their babies to forcible removal at birth by the same past illegal adoption practices as Aboriginal mothers.
"How do you feel personally? Should they receive an apology?" Ms Gillard replied: "I see in the media - and have heard sometimes face to face - some of the stories of women who face very devastating circumstances of having children taken, or being put under intolerable pressure to relinquish their children, in a different age and a different time. "So, as a human being, of course you extend your sympathy to anybody who lived through that and through years of not knowing what happened to their child. So I think it's something we can all say, we're sorry that ever happened in Australian history." Although this was cause of much excitement for Margaret and Trish, this personal “sorry” from the Prime Minister was not enough. “We want our children to know that we did not give them away. We want them to know that they were loved and wanted,” Trish said.
“We do not want compensation, we just want healing.” The "white stolen generations" are so-called to distinguish them from the indigenous stolen generations, but their suffering is shared. Margaret last year received a handwritten letter from an indigenous elder. "I applaud the Prime Minister's apology to our mob. But what about the white stolen generations that have suffered the same fate," the elder wrote. Loading
"I know many white people who went through the same pain. So why can't the government do its healing again and apologise to the white stolen generation to bring closure to all this suffering. "As we walk the same land. Breathe the same air. Drink the same water."
Amazingly, no one was injured when one of Europe's largest oil refineries, like, totally burned with the force of a thousand suns yesterday. And obviously it's in Russia.
The refinery is OJSC TANECO, formerly known as the Nizhnekamsk refinery, in Tartarstan. If you get into your Lada and drive due East from Moscow, you'll get there in about 14 hours.
Reuters reports that the fire was put out the same evening it started and there were no injuries. It will take a few months to get production back up.
It churns out 140,000 barrels of gas and diesel a day, and that production all goes to Russia.
This picture (and the above video) turned up on English Russia and gives you a sense of scale of the blaze.

"What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War, or the passing of a particular period of post-war history, but the end of history as such: that is, the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government."
~ Francis Fukuyama, "The End of History?" a 1989 essay published in The National Interest
Self-styled "champions of democracy," Western and Chinese alike, insist that "Communist" China ought to look to democratic Taiwan for guidance on how to reform its political system. They insist that "Communist" China ought to adopt Taiwanese style democracy as practiced by Taiwan independence fascists Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shiu-bian.
Champions of democracy need to think again. Democracy is the breeding ground for fascism. Democracy provides all the necessary conditions for fascism to take root and mature. Unless for some perverse, indecipherable reason champions of democracy want mainland China, with its 1.3 billion people, to march down the same fascist path as Taiwan's Quisling nomenklatura, they had better check their premises and revise their recommendations.
Democracy incorporates a variety of legal constraints against the abuse of power. In theory, these constraints prevent the dangerous concentration of power in any single branch of government, particularly the executive. In practice, they merely legitimize state violence against defenseless citizens struggling to lead their own lives and follow their own dreams. In theory, democracy is government of the people, by the people, and for the people. In practice, democracy is government of an elective dictator, by an elective dictator, and for an elective dictator.
Fortunately for mankind, Frances Fukuyama and his fellow champions of democracy are wrong. History has not ended. Mankind's ideological evolution has not reached its end point. Western liberal democracy is not the final form of human government. Otherwise mankind would be trapped within a Kafkaesque nightmare world from which there is "No Exit."
Communism doesn't Work. Neither does Democracy
"In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is."
~ Yogi Berra
Communism was destined to fail even before it was implemented, because it was based on a fundamentally flawed assumption about human nature. The assumption was that human beings would behave "unselfishly," as defined by Marxist-Leninists, if only political leaders with determination held guns to peoples' heads and forced them to act "unselfishly." Communism failed because human beings can't be psychologically browbeaten or physically coerced into behaving "unselfishly." People who want to coerce others into behaving "unselfishly" will themselves behave according to their fundamental human nature. They will impose their own selfish values of "unselfishness" upon others, and refer to it as "selfless service."
What champions of democracy don't realize, or realize but refuse to admit, is that the same holds true for democracy. Democracy was also destined to fail even before it was implemented, because it too was based on a fundamentally flawed assumption about human nature. The assumption was that "democratically elected" officials would miraculously behave "unselfishly" by virtue of "the democratic process." Democracy has failed because elected officials don't behave unselfishly merely because they promised to do so during their election campaigns. Elected officials, once in office, will behave according to their fundamental human nature. They will abuse the powers delegated to them by "the democratic process" to further their own selfish interests, then glorify their despotic behavior as "selfless service."
Like Warsaw Pact victims of the Communist delusion, champions of democracy are victims of their own delusions about how democracy ought to work in theory, as opposed to how it actually works in practice.
Both Communism and democracy failed miserably as political systems because they are predicated upon wishful thinking about human nature. Communism and democracy are both predicated on the hypothetical premise that "If pigs had wings, they could fly." Unfortunately for both Communists and champions of democracy, pigs don't have wings, they can't fly, and all the wishing in the world won't make them.
The only politico-economic system, or to be more precise, metasystem, grounded in the fundamental reality of human nature, is the spontaneously generated free marketplace.
Democracy, Breeding Ground for Fascism
"Nothing matters more than winning. Not even what you believe in."
~ Tagline for The Candidate (1972, directed by Michael Ritchie, written by Jeremy Larner, former speechwriter for Eugene McCarthy)
Remember The Candidate, the biting political satire starring Robert Redford? The Internet Movie DataBase summarizes the plot: "Californian lawyer Bill McKay fights for the little man. His charisma and integrity get him noticed by the Democratic Party machine and he is persuaded to run for the Senate against an apparently unassailable incumbent. It's agreed he can handle it his own way, on his own terms. But once he's in the race and his prospects begin to improve, the deal starts to change."
Why does the deal start to change?
The deal starts to change because democracy is inherently corrupting. Democracy incorporates certain perverse incentives. Democracy's holiest sacrament is popular elections. Popular elections compel candidates for political office to resort to populist demagoguery, i.e., "impassioned appeals to the prejudices and emotions of the populace." Popular elections compel candidates to sacrifice reason to passion, substance to image, and principle to expediency.
As the tagline for The Candidate reminds us, under democracy's system of popular elections, "Nothing matters more than winning. Not even what you believe in."
No wonder Thomas Jefferson, author of the Bill of Rights, complained that "Democracy is nothing more than mob rule." No wonder James Madison, Father of the Constitution, concluded that "Democracies have … been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property."
Austrian School economist Friedrich von Hayek's landmark book, The Road to Serfdom, includes a chapter on populism and fascism entitled, "Why the Worst Get on Top." The title of the chapter says it all.
Why do the worst get on top? The worst get on top because democracy's defining institution, popular elections, do not work as advertised. In theory, democratic elections ensure that only the most farsighted leaders offering the most rational policies get on top. In practice, democratic elections ensure that only the most shameless demagogues, for whom nothing matters more than winning, who are willing to betray what they believe in, will get on top.
Adolf Hitler, democratically elected Chancellor of Germany understood this better than anyone. As Der Fhrer himself observed, "I know perfectly well that in the scientific sense there is no such thing as race. As a politician [however] I need an idea which enables the order which has hitherto existed on a historic basis to be abolished and an entirely new order enforced and given an intellectual basis. And for this purpose the idea of race serves me well."
Democracy, an Object Lesson for China
"You can observe a lot just by watching."
~ Yogi Berra
Self-styled champions of democracy insist that "Communist" China ought to look to democratic Taiwan for guidance on how to reform its political system. Ironically, many political reformers agree, but not in the sense that champions of democracy mean. By observing real-life political developments on mainland China during the 50s, 60s, and 70s, and on Taiwan from the 80s till today, political reformers on both mainland China and Taiwan have learned two enormously valuable political lessons:
Lesson One: Communism doesn't work. This lesson was learned to watch desperately as Mao Zedong's economically suicidal, coercive egalitarian policies destroyed mainland China's economy and society.
Lesson Two: Democracy doesn't work. This lesson was learned to watch incredulously as Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian's economically suicidal, pro-independence policies destroyed Taiwan's economy and society.
Taiwan's ill-fated experiment in democracy has provided Chinese political reformers on both sides of the Taiwan Strait with an unmistakable lesson. Taiwan has shown them that democracy is as much a recipe for social, economic, and political disaster as Communism.
These two important lessons will stand the Chinese nation in good stead as the coming century unfolds, because the adoption of Communism and democracy are the two most catastrophic blunders committed by developing nations in the late 20th and early 21st century.
Chinese political reformers, like Yogi Berra, observed a lot just by watching.
Democracy is structurally defective. The defects of democracy, its ineffectual constraints against the expansion of power, its predisposition to reward fascist demagoguery, are defects in its incentive structure. Such defects were unwittingly designed into the system from its inception. Such defects cannot be "fixed" by "reformers" waving brooms in the air and promising to sweep out the cobwebs of the previous administration. The only solution to the insoluble problems of democracy, is to jettison the system altogether start over with a clean slate.
The mainland region of China tried Communism and discovered it didn't work. The Taiwan region of China tried democracy and discovered it doesn't work either. A future, reunified China has an unprecedented opportunity, one that seldom arises in history, to try a radically different political system that does work, that genuinely ensures human beings' natural rights and individual liberty. That system is known as "market anarchism" or "anarcho-capitalism."
Ironically, if China were to move boldly forward and adopt such a system, it would actually be returning to its historical roots, to the great Daoist philosopher Laozi's "wu wei er zi" (govern by doing nothing).

Last weekend, as thousands of Indigenous protesters continued their efforts to ward off construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a delegation from another life-and-death struggle visited the Native encampments in Standing Rock, North Dakota. While there have been numerous expressions of solidarity between Black Lives Matter organizers and Indigenous activists, this meeting marked a historic moment, as organizers from different fronts of struggle met in a place that has galvanized Native resistance to environmental racism in the United States. This week, Miski Noor, an organizer with Black Lives Matter Minneapolis, took a moment to discuss the trip with Truthout, and to explain why she and others felt the journey was necessary.
What moved you and other Black organizers to travel from Minneapolis to the frontlines of the #NoDAPL struggle? What was the discussion behind that decision like?
It was really important to me to show up for Indigenous folks and for #NoDAPL. I think many times resistance is romanticized and we picture it differently in our minds, as opposed to what it actually looks like in real time. I recognized that this fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline is [a] critical fight for ALL of us. This isn't just an Indigenous issue; water is life for all of us and we have a responsibility to the Earth and future generations to protect it. While at the camp, I heard over and over again from Native folks how they have shown up in their cities across the country for Black lives. As BLM [Black Lives Matter], we have built power and we have a platform. And as a movement, we have a duty to uplift and amplify the stories and struggles of all marginalized folks, as our liberation is intertwined. The history of genocide and stolen land and stolen labor in America will forever link Black folks and Indigenous folks (and let us be clear that the two are not mutually exclusive), as there can be no Black liberation without Indigenous sovereignty.
How many Black organizers made the trip, and what was the welcome you received in Standing Rock like? What struck you about the camp, in terms of what you saw or heard upon arriving?
There were about a dozen of us who made this trip, and more folks are organizing to go again in the coming weeks. Our family in the camps welcomed us lovingly. It is a well-run community at the camps, as people have created systems that actually meet people's needs. Food, shelter, safety and more are discussed at nightly camp meetings. As you walk through the camp, you can't pass a tent or teepee without coming across a “hello” or a smile. I was struck by the sense of community and how yet again, we as people coming together illustrate that scarcity is a myth, and that capitalism desperately needs this myth to survive.
Can you tell us a bit about your conversations, or any circles or events you participated in during your visit?
One of the most important things I did there was listen. I learned an incredible amount in a short period of time, mostly through storytelling. I listened to stories from Native youth about their everyday lives — growing up on reservations and small towns and big cities across the country. I learned about ancestral histories and the many conflicts that Indigenous Nations set aside to come together to protect the water, and that this is the largest gathering of Indigenous Nations since 1973. Every morning, Indigenous women from all Nations come together and march to the river, and on Sunday morning, we were invited to join them. We walked into the river together, both praying to the water and for the water. Several women then shared their testimonies and we all took a pinch of tobacco and released it into the water. It was a healing ceremony, and I will forever be grateful for that.
Do you think there's something special happening, in this historic moment, at the intersection of Black and Brown struggles?
Yes, completely. This moment is a gift, an opportunity for all of us to put our politics into practice. Solidarity is a buzzword for progressives, something we rarely see in action in a meaningful way. This is a fight being led by Indigenous communities and it is our duty to show up for one another if freedom and liberation is really the end goal. Our movements are stronger when we do this.
Will the power of solidarity between Black and Brown peoples help us all get free?
I believe we must step beyond solidarity, and that Black and Brown power will get us free. We do not have the resources that multibillion dollar corporations and oil companies have, but if we frame the conversation and victory in ways that make sense for our peoples, we do not need their resources. We do not have to fight on their terms, which are dictated by white supremacy and based on current systems of injustice — in fact, it is the opposite. Our power is in our relationships, and one of our main focuses should be relationship building and building movement cultures based on collaboration and reciprocity.
One thing I've heard over and over again is that FDR concealed his dependence on a wheelchair, and the American public was unaware that he was physically disabled. Is that true?
Cecil replies:
If a president sits in a wheelchair and no one's there to photograph him, is he really paraplegic? Franklin Delano Roosevelt never explicitly denied that he'd lost the use of his legs, but he sure did his damnedest to keep people — especially of the camera-toting variety — from seeing him wheel around. When rare 1944 footage of FDR rolling onboard the U.S.S. Baltimore surfaced three years ago, the Associated Press claimed “Roosevelt's disability was virtually a state secret during his presidency,” echoing an assumption popularized by Hugh Gregory Gallagher's 1980 book FDR's Splendid Deception. That doesn't quite cover it, though. Long before the internet, FDR evidently grasped the truth of the information-age maxim “Pics or it didn't happen”: many Americans knew Roosevelt was disabled, but he was determined they not perceive him as such.
It was in August 1921 that Roosevelt, the Democratic candidate for vice-president just the year before, became mysteriously paralyzed from the waist down and was diagnosed with polio. (Scrutinizing his symptoms posthumously, modern doctors have suggested that what he really had was Guillain-Barré syndrome, but until someone digs the old boy up and finds some usable DNA, we'll stick with what his contemporaries believed.) A vigorous 39-year-old, Roosevelt threw himself into a series of recuperative regimens, and by the time he was called upon to nominate Al Smith at the party's 1924 convention, Roosevelt was capable of hauling his lower body across the stage on crutches.
Roosevelt went on to run for Smith's seat as governor of New York, and his Republican opponents were quick to target his disability. Smith cut them off at the pass: acknowledging Roosevelt's “lack of muscular control of his lower limbs,” Smith insisted that “a Governor does not have to be an acrobat. We do not elect him for his ability to do a double back-flip or a handspring.”
In preparation for his first presidential campaign, Roosevelt addressed the subject head on. In 1931, Liberty magazine ran a story titled “Is Franklin D. Roosevelt Physically Fit to Be President?” “The next President of the United States may be a cripple,” the piece began; Roosevelt was remarkably candid and submitted to examination by three physicians. The not entirely straightforward conclusion: “Governor Roosevelt is confident of ultimate total recovery.”
And then, once Roosevelt was elected, his disability was, for the most part, no longer under discussion. How'd he manage it? For starters, few White House press secretaries have tyrannized D.C. reporters as thoroughly as Steve Early. Through FDR's tenure, Early banned anyone seeking to snap a pic of the president in his wheelchair; Secret Service agents more than once yanked film or plates from the camera of a misbehaving photog. As for inquiries into Roosevelt's physical condition, they were invariably met with a single response: “It's not a story.”
Roosevelt's public appearances were carefully stage-managed to similar effect. The president rarely emerged from his limousine in the view of the public or the press; his legs were supported with steel braces, and when he spoke, he would grip the podium forcefully with both hands (his lecterns were often special-built heavy-duty models) and emphasize his points with a jaunty, vigorous thrust of his head.
But neither did his condition go wholly overlooked. Time and the New Yorker both casually mentioned FDR using a wheelchair in 1934, as did a 1941 Life profile. Yet even his political adversaries — and Henry Luce was no fan — didn't harp on Roosevelt's disability, though Luce managed to publish a rare photo of him in a wheelchair in 1937. More remarkably, Roosevelt's overseas enemies rarely attempted to exploit his disability. Mussolini did once splutter, “Never in the course of history has a nation been guided by a paralytic,” and a German propagandist called FDR “a physically broken person who is constantly venting his hysteria,” but honestly you'd figure they'd have made more of it.
When he ran for his fourth term in 1944, Roosevelt was 62 and his health became an issue for the first time in a decade. He also appeared publicly in his wheelchair. “I hope that you will pardon me for this unusual posture of sitting down,” Roosevelt told Congress after returning from Yalta, “but I know that you will realize that it makes it a lot easier for me not to have to carry about ten pounds of steel around on the bottom of my legs.”
FDR was perhaps the most effective American politician of all time, and throughout his career he managed his disability with a hard-nosed pragmatism that, as with so much of his presidential style, could be classified either as take-charge leadership or outright manipulation, depending on your perspective. Think about it, though: today there'd be a treacly ten-minute documentary at the DNC about Franklin's polio, set to soft but stirring music, with poor Eleanor forced to gaze dewy-eyed into the distance. It's enough to make you think the Great Depression really was the good old days.

NYC Taxi And Limo Commission Looks To Regulate All Ride Hailing Services
from the because-that's-how-innovation-works dept
The website and/or smartphone application must provide Passengers, upon request, with an estimate of the total fare, inclusive of all fees and any price multiplier or variable pricing policy in effect, for the ride.
A Base Owner must not dispatch a For-Hire Vehicle that is equipped with more than one electronic device in addition to the dispatch equipment required by the Vehicle's affiliated Base...
a For-Hire Vehicle may be equipped with one electronic device that is used to accept dispatches from a Base or FHV Dispatch Application, provided that that the device is mounted in a fixed position and not hand-held and use of the electronic device is limited to either voice or one-touch preprogrammed buttons or keys while the Vehicle is in motion.
Whatever you might think of Uber in terms of its attitude and practices (and, really, people feel this weird need to rant on about such feelings, but that's unrelated to the point of this post -- so no need to tell everyone), you can't really deny that it has truly revolutionized the way that many people are able to get around in a variety of metropolitan areas. And Uber and its various competitors have done this by building a better system that is much more convenient and easy to use, and actually using much more realistic market forces, rather than doing silly things like artificially limiting the number of taxi medallions to keep taxi services scarce and expensive.Of course, the old beneficiaries of the system, have hit back any way they can. As we've written repeatedly, various cab companies and bureaucrats seem to go out of their way to attack such ride sharing services. The typical go-to claim from those hating on ride hailing services is that because they're less regulated, they're more subject to fraud and abuse or unsafe driving conditions. There is, however, little evidence to back that up. While there are some anecdotal stories of bad ride hailing drivers, we're already seeing innovative ways to deal with that. For example, in India, Uber recently added an emergency button to its app, which would directly alert police if a rider was in trouble.In short, what we've seen is that, through innovation, competition and (most importantly) an abundance of information, a better overall result can occur. The reasons for many taxi regulations in the past was because of clear information asymmetry: taxi drivers could (and frequently did) screw over passengers, because there was basically no recourse. There was no way for a rider to know if the driver was safe or not, and (more importantly) no real way for that rider to then warn future passengers. But ride hailing services changed that in a big way by flipping the equation, and allowing a good way to rate drivers and to create incentives for those drivers to do a good job. It's not perfect, but, frankly, my own experience in using Uber and Lyft has been that the overall experience has been much, much better than using a traditional cab.In New York City -- a place where cabs have long been limited by its famous medallion system -- there's been a struggle to deal with this innovative change. Just last year, we wrote about the Taxi and Limousine Commission declaring Lyft to be illegal. And, a few months ago, a NYC politician proposed a bill that would require the TLC to create its own Uber-like app . Because, apparently, innovation works by having the government mandate another part of the government copy an innovative company?Either way, the TLC is now looking to go even further, in proposing new rules that say that basically any ride hailing app should be fully regulated by the NYC TLC and including a bunch of conditions that really don't seem necessary. Some of them just seem like relics from a previous era that are there because they were there in the past. It's difficult to see why that makes any sense. And then there are new requirements that also seem bizarre. Like this:I can see how that would be a nice feature to have, but should it beby the government? If Uber doesn't provide that and Lyft does, then isn't that just a competitive advantage for Lyft? And, really, do exist taxi systems already do that beyond a driver tossing out a random estimate off the top of his head on how much it will cost to go somewhere?Then there's something really concerning: buried in the rules is the idea that drivers. I've seen many drivers that work for both Lyft and Uber (and sometimes others as well). Specifically, the rules have a "one device" rule -- saying drivers can only use a single device at a time, but many drivers that I've seen who work for multiple services have separate devices (and some, like Uber, will offer to rent you a special phone just for being an Uber driver, if you don't want to/can't use your own phone).Again, I'm sure the TLC would argue that this is for safety reasons. Elsewhere in the document it suggests that by arguing that this single device cannot be handheld:And, sure, you can reasonably worry about the driving safety of someone who has multiple such devices, though I've seen plenty of drivers with two or three phones lined up in a way that seems perfectly reasonable.The more glaring concern here, though, is that such a rule basically locks in the incumbents and harms the upstarts. If a driver can't drive for Uber and a new ride hailing startup, they're likely to just stick with Uber, and the upstarts get cut out. That's a problem. Even if that's not the intention, it's these kinds of regulations that all too often lock things in so that incumbents stay in power, while startups are blocked.Furthermore, just the idea that any new service in this space has to now go and plead with the TLC to get "licensed" is going to slow and limit the opportunities for new and innovative players in this space. Uber got to where it was by building a useful service, not having to ask local bureaucrats for permission every time. The next generation of companies looking to reinvent the space won't be so lucky -- and that may mean we all suffer.

We hear about the issue of ocean plastic a lot, but these new photographs demonstrate just how pervasive the pollution is. Roatán-based photographer Caroline Power shared pictures on Facebook taken near the Caribbean island belonging to Honduras, revealing what she calls a “sea of plastic and Styrofoam”. Power said, “This has to stop.”
Power shared photographs of waves of plastic garbage floating in seaweed in a part of the world we tend to think of as pristine. Pressure group Blue Planet Society said the trash could have come from the Montagua River in Guatemala.
Related: Could France-sized ocean garbage patch become 196th nation?
Power seems to have posted in hopes of prompting people to think about their own consumption of single-use plastic. She wrote in the Facebook post, “Think about your daily lives. How did you take your food to go last time you ate out? How was your last street food served? Chances are it was styrofoam and served with a plastic fork and then put in a plastic bag. Do you still use plastic garbage bags? Plastic soda bottles? Ziplock bags? Plastic wrap on your food? Do you buy toilet paper that comes wrapped in plastic instead of paper? Do you put your fruit and veggies in produce bags at the grocery?”
Power challenged people and businesses to keep their garbage, after sorting out organic and recyclable trash, for a week. She said, “You will be disgusted by how many single-use items you use.”
Every single year, eight million metric tons of plastic enter the world's oceans. Plastic pollution isn't just an eyesore; The Independent quoted statistics saying it's harming over 600 species around the world. Around 100,000 marine animals and more than one million birds perish because of plastic every year. Surely we can do better?

After securing their fifth perfect road record in Pac-12 Conference play in the past six seasons, the Oregon Ducks now return home in their pursuit of the league's North division title.
Up next is USC for the Ducks (7-3, 5-2 Pac-12), who entered the Associated Press top 25 rankings at No. 23 on Sunday, one day after UO knocked off then-No. 7 Stanford, 38-36 on the road.
Like the Ducks, the No. 22 Trojans have rattled off four consecutive victories after a 3-3 start.
Ducks coach Mark Helfrich met with reporters for his weekly Sunday press conference to discuss the win against the Cardinal, who remain in the driver's seat despite the defeat -- only the program's fourth at home since 2010 -- to win the North so long as it beats California this weekend.
Players of the game were receiver Darren Carrington on offense, linebackers Rodney Hardrick and Joe Walker on defense and kickoff specialist Matt Wogan on special teams. Scout players of the week were Drayton Carlberg and Spencer Stark on offense, Jhet Janis on defense (though Helfrich singled out the work of the entire scout offensive line) and Taylor Stinson on special teams.
Here are Helfrich's comments:
Do you take the AP ranking as any confirmation that you are playing your best football right now?
Helfrich: Not really. I don't think we ever look at somebody else's impression of what we're doing for validation, either way. I think the biggest thing is our guys have come to work every day like we talked about last night and owned what's good and owned what's bad and gone about their business. Now the trick is after such an emotional game is got ready to play and get ready for a very, very talented team. You flip on the tape and you are quickly slapped in the face of how good USC is and we're all going to have to be excited about that challenge.
Do you see tangible differences in how this team is playing since the Utah loss?
Helfrich: Yeah, we're just playing with more confidence. Just playing fast and free and we're still making a ton of mistakes and still played great at times on some units and played poorly at time some units and the trick is playing through that as a team and coming out in the end as a team, just like last night.
After starting 3-3, is this four-game winning streak made more gratifying?
Helfrich: You just can't sit here at any point and take a deep breath and be satisfied with anything, whether it's academics or everything else that goes on behind the scenes here, you're constantly trying to get better at your job and everybody else's deal so I don't think there's ever a time, ever, in this business where we say, we're good. That's again you have to get the right people around you, players and coaches all of those things to buy into that type of deal and continue to improve. We have a ton of football ahead.
Oregon's Mark Helfrich coaches wide receiver Bralon Addison (2) during the second half against Stanford.
Do you think players have any greater appreciation of victories considering how much this program had made winning a habit?
Helfrich: I think that's the total, and we talked about this last week, the total belief and commmitment to a process is when you work at that process without a tangible result, without a positive tangible result. That's commitment. When you are committed to the process and things aren't great, it's just like raising a kid. Sometimes you have to do things that aren't fun and aren't great but you know that will benefit you down the road. It's an easier sell to an 18- or 19-year-old kid to go, 'Oh, OK, that does work.' It helps you win or helps you get a good great or whatever, but hopefully we're in this for the long haul.
Are you surprised at how quickly receiver Darren Carrington and quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. clicked together?
Helfrich: Vernon has that chemistry with everything with the broken play, the playground kind of plays that those guys have made a ton of. He and Darren have hooked up big-time.
This USC team has gone through its own struggles. Is this still the team you respected so much back in August?
Helfrich: Oh yeah, they're exceptional. Skill guys everywhere. I think there are so many guys who we tried to recruit and so there's a lot of familiarity of who they are. Kessler is a tremendous player. Their defense is getting better and better. They had a couple of, whatever you want to say, hiccups there, against Notre Dame had some big plays against them, but there are also some guys involved on the other team who are pretty good. But yeah they are outstanding. Adoree Jackson is kind of their Charles Nelson that plays offense, that plays defense, that plays special teams, all of that at a very, very high level.
What stood out from Stanford game?
Helfrich: I think there's a lot more good than bad to beat a team like that. I thought just how we competed, especially defensively, we stayed confident, played most of the time with great pad level, tackled fairly well. and just kept playing. The play of the game was probably Kani Benoit running down the ... I guess that was ruled a fumble, that's why I was confused last night with the question. I thought it was a pick. But Kani, I mean, that was a huge play. Defense holds them to a field goal. Huge, huge, huge turn of events. Then a bunch of great efforts on special teams, great job protecting on that last punt. Devon Allen finishing the play down there, putting their corner kind of in McCaffrey's lap and making the tackle. Then obviously Joe Walker finishing off at the end, among others.
Can you describe the work leading up to each week? You've been praising your scout teams since the Stanford win.
Helfrich: That's something that's kind of behind the scenes that goes on every week that needs to be talked about. Your scout teams are your lifeblood. If those guys aren't great, you don't have confidence in anything. You don't have confidence in your defense, your special teams, your offense. If it's phony and it's hey we're going to run this on air, everybody knows that. If it's not a great look that whole urgency and confidence is not there. So defensively we have enough similarity, enough carry over that we can call our looks similar to what they present, so that wasn't as big. Offensively for them you're getting six O-linemen, seven O-linemen and a fullback, particular numbers of those guys. They do certain things in this 12 personnel group and this other 12 personnel group ... to get that coordinated they did a fantastic job. We had multiple defensive groups and we had the one substitution error there at the end coming out of a timeout, which was 100 percent on us, but for the most part did very well and that's a direct result of having confidence in it.
What can you say about Taj Griffin's evolution this season?
Helfrich: He just needs plays and experience. That's the hard thing for a guy like that or a guy like Kirk Merritt, even Kani or Tony to a certain extend. We've got Royce Freeman is a very good back. Kani is playing at a high level, we've got Charles that we're mixing in, Bralon, some other guys. So when they're in there, every play they want to be a touchdown. Like we talked about early in the season, his first instinct is to bounce, that's what every fast guy's first instinct is to be a fast guy and think you're going to outrun everybody. There was one point where he could of put his foot on the ground and knifed it. But it is as great to see the next time he had his hands on the ball him going out there and playing. His best days are ahead of him, absolutely.
What's the play-calling dynamic like on defense since defensive backs coach John Neal moved to the press box?
Helfrich: The play calling hasn't really changed much. It's more of the feedback between series, the recognition of things as plays happen. That's a different dialogue just because the voices are different, but nothing from a logistical or a schematic standpoint.
Your games have come down to the wire for much of the season, and last night a bunch of Pac-12 games went down to the last play. What do you make of the parity in the Pac-12?
Helfrich: Well that could be argued in a number of ways. It's a tremendously difficult conference. As we talked about back at media day, we expected something like this could happen and might happen and nobody is undefeated. I don't think anybody is surprised by that, unfortunately. Good or bad, up to you.

On March 4, as they were preparing their vision for a new Mission Valley football stadium, San Diego City Councilman Scott Sherman, real estate analyst Gary London, developer Perry Dealy and City Attorney Jan Goldsmith visited Qualcomm, the company.
They met with Ed Capozzoli, the vice president in charge of all of Qualcomm's facilities and real estate needs and Monique Rodriguez, director of government affairs.
Sherman and the team wanted to pitch Qualcomm on an idea. Their vision for the Mission Valley stadium site included nearly 3 million square feet of office space. You can't really fill that much piece by piece. They wanted to lure a large corporation to the development plan — someone who could build a whole campus there.
Qualcomm would be perfect, they thought. After all, it was planning a 1.2 million square foot expansion. Key word: was.
But when the group sat down with Capozzoli and Rodriguez, they couldn't even get to their pitch.
“We got blindsided,” said London. Three other participants in the meeting confirmed what happened next.
Capozzoli lit into them for the way he felt the company was treated by the city. Particularly frustrating, he said, was the traffic situation around Qualcomm's Sorrento Valley office. London said Capozzoli told the group the city was dragging its feet and not letting Qualcomm modernize nearby traffic lights.
Capozzoli was also frustrated, he said, that the city was handing out subsidies to other local companies like Illumina, but ignoring Qualcomm's very basic problems.
And then the kicker: Even as it expands elsewhere, Capozzoli said Qualcomm would never build anything in San Diego again. Capozzoli, participants in the meeting confirmed, said that order came from the top of Qualcomm's leadership. That planned 1.2 million square foot expansion has not gone forward.
I asked Qualcomm representatives if this was the company's official take. Not really.
“It was a private meeting at which the attendees felt comfortable in expressing their frustrations in very direct language,” said spokeswoman Emily Kilpatrick in an email. “We know that the mayor has taken our concerns seriously and we expressed the urgency of our needs to those in the meeting.”
Kilpatrick praised the mayor for creating a task force to help companies like Qualcomm address issues with the city in a one-stop shop. She did not expressly deny the company is shutting down plans to grow in San Diego, however.
“In order for Qualcomm to continue to grow in San Diego, it is imperative we continue to partner with the City and especially the Mayor's office on addressing challenges which include traffic, water and expediting permitting processes,” she said in the email.
If it is true that Qualcomm is done building anything in San Diego, it could be a new low in relations between the city and its largest company. It also highlights a troubling backdrop to the stadium saga: that as the community and politicians rally to subsidize and keep one company, the Chargers, in town, another much larger one — with roughly 13,000 more employees — sits displeased.
A 2013 study by the San Diego Workforce Partnership and Regional Economic Development Corp. found that Qualcomm ‘s presence supports more than 27,000 jobs in the region, including its own — adding to a $4.53 billion annual economic impact. Qualcomm employees represent nearly 2 percent of all workers in the city.
Matt Awbrey, the communications director for the mayor, said Capozzoli's comments came as a surprise to the mayor's office.
“We have a great working relationship with Qualcomm,” he said. Awbrey said city staff is regularly meeting with Qualcomm representatives and leaders of other Sorrento Valley businesses.
The city attorney, Jan Goldsmith, often stresses to me how he's not political — it's all about the law. When I asked his spokesman why he was in a meeting like this, I got this response.
“I guess that's the benefit of being a citywide elected official. You get invited to a lot of meetings and you get to pick the ones that interest you,” said Gerry Braun, Goldsmith's spokesperson. He said he was unaware of Qualcomm's concerns and deferred all other comments about the meeting to Sherman's office. He said Sherman invited Goldsmith.
Sherman told me he thought they just got the wrong guy on the wrong day.
Later, in a written statement, he said this:
“I appreciate representatives from the company taking the time to meet with us and give their honest feedback about city operations. Since taking office, I have worked hard to help create a more business-friendly environment and have taken their concerns into account as we continue this mission,” he said.
Qualcomm's frustrations apparently range from specific (the company's employees are upset about long traffic delays in Sorrento Valley) to more vague complaints.
Capozzoli's reference to the city's effort to subsidize other businesses to keep them here is intriguing. Amid much fanfare last year, Illumina, a medical device manufacturer, agreed to keep some jobs in San Diego in exchange for $1.5 million in tax rebates.
Russ Gibbon, business development manager for the city, told us last year there's a specific Council policy outlining the requirements for subsidies and it comes with a certain risk.
“It has the potential to create a bunch of ‘me-toos' out there, so we have to limit it to projects with extraordinary public benefit,” Gibbon said at the time.
Awbrey said Qualcomm has never communicated that it was done expanding in San Diego. He said the city was moving forward on one of the company's major issues: a desire for adaptive traffic signals in Sorrento Valley. The special signal system helps traffic flow by adjusting to its intensity throughout the day.
Qualcomm might have shelved its expansion in San Diego because of other forces. Its business focus is now largely overseas – it has no particular reason to expand operations in San Diego. And it faces some rough headwinds: The company just agreed to pay a $975 million fine to China. Its longtime client, Samsung, startled some observers when it did not include a Qualcomm chip in its new flagship phone.
Regardless, London said the meeting with Qualcomm made him worried.
“What frightened me was the possibility that this was the opening salvo in a long-term movement on the part of Qualcomm to diminish its footprint in San Diego, which from an economic and political standpoint is completely unacceptable,” London said.
Disclosure: Qualcomm's founder, Irwin Jacobs, is a major supporter of Voice of San Diego.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services set up the facility on May 31. According to a press release, the medical unit is staffed by "a medical team from the HHS National Disaster Medical System -- a doctor, two nurses, two emergency medical technician paramedics (EMT-P) and a pharmacist."
For over two weeks, my NewsHour colleagues and I reached out to media contacts at HHS, the U.S. Coast Guard and everyone listed as a possible media contact for BP, in an attempt to visit the unit and get a general sense of how many people were being treated there , who they were and what illnesses they had. We got nowhere. It was either "access denied," or no response at all. It was something that none of us had ever encountered while covering a disaster. We're usually at some point provided access to the health services being offered by the federal government.
Johnny Depp and Hunter S. Thompson were friends for more than 10 years before the author killed himself in 2005.
The two men bonded instantly during their first meeting in 1994, and Depp went on to play Thompson's alter ego in the 1998 film adaptation of "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," reports the Associated Press.
"Hunter shaved my head, in fact. I didn't look in the mirror at all, I was in mortal fear. Hunter had a mining light… on his head – we were in his kitchen – and yeah, he shaved my hair."
In his conversation with Lipton, Depp revealed the extreme measures he undertook to be able to portray Thompson's alter ego, telling the host he even lived in the author's basement, which they called "the dungeon," for a couple months.

During Wednesday's Democratic Leadership Debate on CNN, DNC Chair candidate Representative Keith Ellison (D-MN) stated, “Donald Trump has already done a number of things which legitimately raise the question of impeachment.”
Ellison said, “I think that he — Donald Trump has already done a number of things which legitimately raise the question of impeachment. I mean, on day one, he was in violation of the Emoluments Clause. This is a part of the Constitution that says as the president you can't get payments from a foreign power. The day people checked into his hotel, and started paying him, who were from — who were foreign dignities — dignitaries, he was in violation of that law. There's already a lawsuit filed against him. And right now, we have got to — it's not about only Donald Trump. It is about the integrity of the presidency. So, yeah, I think that we need to begin investigations to, not go after Donald Trump, but to protect our Constitution and the presidency of the United States, to make sure that nobody can monetize the presidency, and make profit off it, for their own gain.”

Gov. Jan Brewer sent five bills to the scrap heap Thursday in a pointed gesture intended to prod lawmakers into a deal on the budget and her plan to expand Medicaid.
The five vetoes, follow-through on Brewer's promise to block legislation until her top priorities move forward, capped a tense day that saw some lawmakers receive threats over their support for the plan to provide health care for more of the state's poor.
In letters explaining her actions, Brewer revealed a growing impatience with the Legislature, which she noted has been in session for 130days and has only five weeks until the constitutional deadline for a fiscal 2014 budget.
“I warned that I would not sign additional measures into law until we see resolution of the two most pressing issues facing us: adoption of a fiscal 2014 state budget and plan for Medicaid,” Brewer wrote. “It is disappointing I must demonstrate the moratorium was not an idle threat.”
If signed into law, the bills would allow people to sue over potential violations of religious freedoms, and require the Department of Education to outline for failing schools how to comply with the school-improvement process, among other things.
Earlier Thursday, House Republicans who support the governor's plan to expand Medicaid forwarded to the state Department of Public Safety for investigation e-mails and phone calls threatening them with various forms of retribution.
Rep. Kate Brophy McGee, R-Phoenix, decried the increasingly nasty tone of the Medicaid-expansion debate in remarks on the House floor, and called for civility as the House contemplates a vote on the proposal.
Threats increasing
Brophy McGee said she was shaken by a voice mail she received when she arrived at her legislative office on Thursday morning.
“It was an obscene, abusive phone call,” she said. The caller, who left the message on Wednesday evening, seemed impaired as he complained about Medicaid expansion. He left a phone number.
Brophy McGee said the call only solidified her resolve to support Medicaid expansion.
Rep. Heather Carter, R-Cave Creek, another proponent of Medicaid expansion, said she also referred a threatening call to security.
Carter said the gist of the message was: “We're going to come in and storm your office.”
“I'm getting e-mails saying, ‘We're going to follow you everywhere you go,'” she said.
Both women said negative messages have increased since last week, when the Senate voted for Medicaid expansion.
The matter is now in the House, where Speaker Andy Tobin, R-Paulden, is meeting with lawmakers to discuss how to move forward on that issue, as well as the state budget.
Nine lawmakers, including Tobin, received an e-mail that begins, “Please kill SB1492, the Medicaid Expansion Act.” It then quotes the Second Amendment and provides a script to be followed as a defense for shooting someone.
Carter said the e-mail “clearly crossed the line.” She turned it over to House security and DPS.
“I'm sensing a pattern and will review all of my e-mails for anything that crosses the line of a threat, which is a felony,” she said. “When you cross over into personal threats, then it becomes an absolute law-enforcement safety concern.”
Others said that while they found the e-mail disturbing, they didn't feel personally threatened.
“I don't feel like my life was in danger,” said Rep. Ethan Orr, R-Tucson.
‘Serious consequences'
While some lawmakers worried about their personal safety, others said it was their political careers that were being threatened.
Rep. Doug Coleman, R-Apache Junction, said he's received threats against his political future, something echoed in an open letter this week from Maricopa County Republican Party Chairman A.J. LaFaro to lawmakers.
“Their egregious actions will have serious consequences,” LaFaro wrote of the six Republicans senators who sided with a unified Democratic caucus to pass Medicaid expansion and add extra funding for education and Child Protective Services. “Their political careers are all but over and their days are numbered.”
But those senators said that since their votes last week, positive comments have eclipsed the negative ones.
Sen. Bob Worsley, R-Mesa, said he's heard “overwhelming support.”
“I haven't had one person come up to me and say, ‘You're wrong,'” he said.
However, “the vocal right” has made its displeasure known, he said.
Senate Majority Leader John McComish, R-Phoenix, who sponsored the Medicaid-expansion amendment, said his favorable feedback outpaced negative comments “20 to 1.”
He said LaFaro and other GOP officials may be in violation of bylaws that call for the organization to be neutral in party primaries.
But LaFaro said calling legislators to account for their votes is “well within the political process.”
“That's not a threat,” he said. “If they are down there not representing their constituents and a majority of the people who are against ‘Obamacare' and Medicaid expansion, then I think they should be challenged and held accountable for their actions.”
He said the county GOP has encouraged members to contact their legislators and express their opposition to expansion, but threats clearly cross the line and are unacceptable.
Some of the tension in the House was sparked inside the Legislature.
Rep. Bob Thorpe, R-Flagstaff, sent an e-mail to a number of his supporters, urging them to contact six of his Republican colleagues who have voiced support for Medicaid expansion.
That prompted a quick admonition from Tobin.
Thorpe e-mailed an apology to the lawmakers admitting he “screwed up.”
“I'm very sorry, and I hope that you can see by what I wrote in my e-mail that I was not trying to be unkind to you, I was simply trying to influence your vote,” he wrote.
Bill is ‘in pretty good shape'
Brewer's proposal has been met with strong resistance from some lawmakers in her own party who say Medicaid expansion under the federal health-care overhaul is financially unsustainable and politically toxic.
During a Thursday taping of 12 News' “Sunday Square Off,” House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rep. John Kavanagh, R-Fountain Hills, said that he will remove the Medicaid language when it reaches his committee.
Should that happen, another House member is expected to introduce Brewer's Medicaid-expansion plan as an amendment.
Responding to Kavanagh's remarks, Brewer said, “Shame on him. I think that the bill is in pretty good shape, I mean little tweaks. But strip the bill after all this work and energy's been put into it? It's very finely tuned.”
Republic reporter Yvonne Wingett Sanchez contributed to this article.
The Nissan Murano CrossCabriolet only had a short life on planet Earth. After poor sales and expensive engineering costs, it was phased out after just three years.
It appears to have found a new life however, in the video above. As you can see, someone has stripped out the interior of the gawky drop-top, filled it with more screens than a CCTV surveillance centre, lobbed in some speakers and then lacquered it in vibrant candy red paint.
Oh, and then put it on 34-inch rims to make it a ‘Donk'. Quite.
No doubt you require a bit of context. Donking is the umbrella word for hi-rise cars. The trend grew out of the Florida music scene, then moved on to the South and made it all the way over to Cali-forn-i-a (as the rappers say).
Normally the foundations for Donks are mid-Seventies Impalas, Caprices and Monte Carlos – all wearing very big shiny rims with low profile rubber. They're even sometimes airbrushed to look like four-wheeled Skittles packets, cereal boxes or even bags of crisps.
However the innovative lot in the video wanted to buck the trend by Donking something very, um, un-Donkable.
Is that a good thing, or straight up ridonkulous? Let us know below.

Subject: Scarlet Begonias (Jam) While 1984 isn't usually what comes to mind when thinking of incredible tours, this is a fine example of Jerry and the band at their absolute peak in terms of listening to each other and creating a vivid space from which to improvise. Jerry's health was in huge decline during this period, his vocals often being strained to the point of scorched during most of 1983-1985. It wasn't until after the coma and return to the road in 1987 that he could croon on a regular basis. However, there were often many great nights of guitar playing pre coma. At this point, he was still performing magically on most nights. The Greek Theatre was always a special place for the band and this run was no exception. This night was the first of a three night run and the first back in their hometown winding down from the long summer tour that started out West, moved to the East and then Midwest. This night among other things was known for the breakout of Dark Star for the first time since New Years 81 and more interestingly played as an encore, While that was satisfying in its own right, I believe the Scarlet Begonias —> Touch of Grey —> Fire on the Mountain was the barn burner of the show. This jam in Scarlet, prior to the move to Touch of Grey, which hadn't ever happened before this night as far as I know, was intense, full of energy and great band syncopation. Paul and I are constantly looking for that magic in the music and this was no exception. The interplay between Jerry's leads, Bob and Phil's rhythmic foundation, the drummers cool fresh sounds and Brent who had come into his own (almost 5 years at this point) was highlighted by this mesmerizing jam. I find this full of energy and fresh ideas that I have drawn from in countless jams. The pace starts out nice and even and then builds dynamically throughout to an interesting crescendo. What always keeps me coming back to this jam is the upbeat nature of it. Scarlet jams could be sometimes short, spacey or even somewhat measured. There might be better ones, but this is pretty cool. I especially like the tease at the end into Fire on the Mountain, which Jerry actually abandons in favor of Touch of Grey - January 25, 2019Scarlet Begonias (Jam)

Subject: MATRIX is the bomb!!! SBD can sound boring (no audience participation) and AUD...though sometimes very good depending on gearand venue can be too mid heavy. Matrix is the best of both worlds IMHO and how I feel I am back there living it all again.
Very nice Dark Star (last verse "ouch" -but that's ok), though some "dis" it.
To me, this DS seemed like a leaping off point for the rest of '84 and into '85 where many of their jams had a spacey DS quality...unlike most previous '80s shows. Maybe it was a "can of worms" that needed opening??? Well ...I for one am glad they did and love the Greek having been there only once in person. Dig this one everyone! - December 8, 2014MATRIX is the bomb!!!

Subject: Notable Dark Star I hadn't thought about this show for awhile, thanks to Hunter for posting this on his Facebook page today. My daughter and I have been listening to this today, and it really is one of the best of 1984. The small hall shows, including Hult and Marin County are very good, as is Cedar Rapids on July 4, but this has one of the best live versions of Hell In A Bucket, and the second set is as good as any in the first half of this decade. The Scarlet>Grey>Fire is unusual, of course, and not only did they play Dark Star, they played it very well. I think this version outclasses the previous 4 played between 12-31-78 through 12-31-81. This isn't an elite show, but it is very, very good. - July 13, 2013Notable Dark Star

Subject: Rare '84 gems '84 is not my cup of tea, but what I do like is mostly found in this run @ the Greek. On this night the SB, Fire and SB are sweet. Kudos for the curve balls of the TOG placement, execution a bit rough, and the DS encore. It's a nice DS, not sure if that's the word association one wants. Not a usual listener of Matrix shows, but This is the source to listen to. SBD is too hollow, the only Aud is very bright and trebly. This is just right. - May 18, 2010Rare '84 gems
A new survey has found that only 6% of respondents would be happy to live in a proposed Equatorial Low Earth Orbit (ELEO) settlement, where humans live in a small cruise ship-like space station at a similar orbit to the ISS.
Four conditions were set for respondents to assess and while at least 30% said they agree with at least one of them, the number shrank significantly when it came to those who could accept all the conditions.
These were that the settlement itself would require permanent residence, would be no bigger than a large cruise ship, would contain no more than 500 people and would require residents to be willing to devote at least 75% of their wealth to move in.
The example settlement used in the survey is Kalpana Two, pictured, a conceptual cylindrical space habitat visualised by Brian Versteeg. Measuring 110 m x 110m it would rotate to provide simulated gravity on the “ground” and zero-gravity near the cylinder's core where occupants can ‘fly', and would be capable of housing 500 – 1,000 people
The study, conducted by researchers from San Jose State University (SJSU) and the FAA Office of Commercial Space Transportation (AST) sought to assess the desirability of such a settlement. Previous similar studies had suggested early space settlements would need to be significantly smaller than believed, and located far closer to Earth.
The research was conducted via an Internet survey made available to the public between 8 January 2016 and 17 June 2016. The survey, using Qualtrics software, received 1,075 responses and was distributed via an email list, social media and spac- related organisations. It should therefore be noted that the respondents are not representative of the general population: 95% actually identified as space enthusiasts.
“95% of respondents were self-described space enthusiasts and 81% were male. 70% were from North America and 20% from Europe,” the study authors Al Globus, from SJSU, and Tom Marotta, from AST, wrote in the research paper.
“This is not surprising as the authors made no attempt to select a random sample of any particular group, but rather to simply distribute the survey as widely as we could.”
The paper itself is rather enthusiastic about the 6% figure, pointing out that while it is a low percentage of those who responded, if considering it 6% of those who globally identify as “space enthusiasts” there are likely more than enough to fill these early settlements. The authors also acknowledge that such a number is not all that surprising given the demands of the move.
However, while the enthusiasm and optimism is laudable, it's worth noting that those principally willing to give up the most were small in number and tended to fall on the wealthier spectrum. So while the possibility of the project exists, it seems that, as with all commercial space projects so far, it would principally have to cater to the rich.
Moreover, when responding to the main attraction of life in space, “the most common remark was simply that it was ‘in space' not any particular characteristic of living in space”. There seems in the responses to be a certain enthusiasm that may not hold up in the actual moment of decision.
The fact that people like the idea of living in space is no surprise; the survey however does little to assuage the realities of the situation. Enthusiasm is promising, however the main result of this survey seems to be that blind optimism is only truly backed up by vast amounts of money.
In a dramatic video, average citizens risked their lives to pull a baby from a pickup truck that rolled over in a raging flash flood. “Dear Jesus, please let this baby breathe,” one rescuer prayed.
Good Samaritans can be seen wading into strong currents to rescue an infant trapped in an overturned Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck. The incident occurred following torrential rains and a tornado that left four people dead and more than 50 injured, WFAA ABC8 reported. The rollover happened near the east Texas town of Canton, about 60 miles east of Dallas.
Tom Mitchell came upon the truck and discovered a man trapped inside with a toddler and infant.
Mitchell said the current was so strong; rescuers were unable to open the doors. After discovering he could not open the doors, he began filming the dramatic video above as others jumped in.
Eventually, the efforts of five or six rescuers paid off, and limp body of the infant is pulled from the truck.
“The infant is white, going blue-ish gray.” Mitchell can be heard explaining. “No color at all and the eyes were not focused when I looked down at her.”
Mitchell put the phone in his pocket and began to help the infant. “This baby is gonna die if we don't start CPR fast,” Mitchell said he had a bad feeling the baby would not survive. “This baby may not make it, this baby may not make it,” he said. “No reaction, nothing is happening.”
Then a woman stepped up and prayed, “Dear Jesus, please let this baby breathe. Dear Jesus, please let this baby breathe.”
“Well the first prayer she said, I felt a response in that child,” Mitchell said. Then he and the other rescuers began to help the toddler who also responded positively.
On Sunday, the father of the infant said they were all doing much better. “Update on Addy bug,” the father said in a statement posted on the hospital's social media page. “(S)he is stable and doing much better. Still under sedation but pulling the breathing tube in the morning to see if she can do it on her own.”
When asked why he shared the dramatic video, Mitchell responded, “I think it shows how the community and strangers all come together.”
Blood is thicker than water, but for the Avett Brothers, music is thicker than blood. It's not just a moniker -- Scott and Seth Avett really are related, and they've been playing together since they were kids. But 2000 was the year they started releasing their signature blend of fervent bluegrass and folk. Fifteen adventurous years later, the North Carolina indie rockers have released four EPs and eight full-lengths (with another on the way), earned a Grammy nomination, played a few late-night TV guest spots, and have been heard on shows like Parenthood and One Tree Hill.
But if one attribute stands out over the Avett Brothers' varied career, it's that they are gentlemen. Their approach to soulful, traditionalist Americana is stark yet rich, sometimes sarcastic, often existential. But their technique is especially unique in the light of their contemporaries, because it is unambiguously honest.
Stylistically, the Brothers are all over the place. "If It's the Beaches" reflects on not deserving forgiveness, and on "Murder in the City," they preach graceful nonviolence over revenge. They are metaphorically overwrought on "The Ballad of Love and Hate," yet tender and romantic on "January Wedding." In fact, they've got a lot of love songs, but this one explains it best why they succeed: "She keeps it simple / And I am thankful for her kind of lovin' / 'Cause it's simple."

Wanting to see how the Brothers have been doing, we called Bob Crawford, who has been with the band since the early days. You know Crawford best for wielding the double bass, but his tenure with the band has, as he says, proved to be as close as family.
"It feels good that we've invested this kind of time, effort, and care into something that has grown personally for us," Crawford says. "The crowds have grown, and the size of the venues have grown, and the band has grown, as far as the amount of people on stage, but we've also been able to grow personally and creatively and keep it all under one roof. It's a great feeling of satisfaction and pride being able to do that."
Crawford says that the band is "well on our way to a new record," pointing to a late 2015 to mid-2016 release. Most of it was recorded last November live in studio, something Crawford says the band hasn't done since Emotionalism, arguably the band's breakout record.
"I feel comfortable saying [this new album] will be somewhat of a departure. But the essence of what we are and what we do will remain. The Avett Brothers people have always known-- and some people have loved -- is very well represented and reflected," Crawford says. "We had seven people recording at the same time and that was kind of a return to how we used to do it . . . So I think that the documentation of the stage band, in and of itself, is a departure and will be a progression."
As with the band's last three releases (starting with I and Love and You), they'll be working closely with mega producer and Def Jam founder Rick Rubin, known best for his work with Red Hot Chili Peppers and rap artists like Run-D.M.C. and Jay-Z. Though a hip-hop producer working on an indie country album may seem unorthodox, Crawford says, the recording approach to each genre is very much the same.
"The first thing to do is solidify that beat. What's that beat gonna do, what're the drums gonna do? Everything builds on top of that," Crawford says. "Now imagine, if you can, that you came up producing rap records, that's very essence of any rap song, is the beat, I can see that being a similar approach for Rick."
Working with Rubin, who has produced dozens and dozens of albums since the '80s, might be a little intimidating for some. And, Crawford admits, shyness was a natural reaction.
"I brought the intimidation to the table, he didn't . . . You just realize the guy on the other side of the glass, who he is and everything he's done and can provide, that can make you feel uncomfortable and intimidated," Crawford recalls. "The reality of the situation is that I've never seen [Rick] treat anyone other than very kind and sweet. He's very flexible and relaxed and poised and very understanding about mistakes and this and that. He wants to create a positive work environment for everyone. I was pretty uncomfortable the first couple days I ever worked with him, but I'm pretty sure that was my fault, not his."
Besides Rubin, another staple of the Avett Brothers is their series of songs about attractive women. There's at least 11 of these songs, including "Pretty Girl From Locust," "Pretty Girl From San Diego," "Pretty Girl From Chile," and even "Pretty Girl at the Airport." Stylistically, each song varies as widely as the diverse regions in question. But are these women real?
"I guess in some way, they're somewhat real," Crawford says. "You can show appreciation and affection in many ways. They're not all songs about girls that were girlfriends or this or that, but a lot of them are like a tip of the hat. There's an instrumental that we played live. I don't think we played it recently, but I believe that has a Pretty Girl title. We recorded it, but it never made a record. I think it's called 'Pretty Girl From Here.'"
In mid-2011, Crawford took a short hiatus or two from the band after learning his daughter, Hallie, had a brain tumor. She went through treatment in 2011 and 2012 at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Tennessee and recovered, but the cancer returned in 2013, so little Hallie, now 5, went through treatment again. Last year was the first time the Crawford family did not have to deal with cancer.
"It's a kind of cancer that's very aggressive. It doesn't go away very easily. You could not have it for five years and it could come back," Crawford says. "She's still in the zone where it's a high risk of occurrence, so we gotta get keep going that's all. We gotta keep going."
I wouldn't say it's in remission. In fact, we go next week to get her checked out, she'll get an MRI scan and we'll see where we stand. We go every three months. And this will be 20 months," Crawford says. "But 2014 was a year of just watching it, just watching, there was no new cancer to report, no new tumors, no you know."
"We felt very blessed to have that year and we hope 2015, hopefully we can kick it off right . . . We got a ways to go yet," Crawford says. "She seems to be doing great. You can't look inside her head, but to be around her, she's doing just phenomenally. We hope that what's on the outside is on the inside and we just keep praying for that."

In today's stock market, there are two types of trader.
One, the traditional investor, places a buy order based on a belief that a company will prosper and that its price will rise, or a sell order based on the opposite belief.
OPPOSING VIEW: Fast trades aid market quality
The other, the high-frequency trader, deploys massive computer capacity and complex algorithms to buy and sell individual stocks multiple times in a fraction of a second, all in search of micro-profits with each trade. This trader cares not a whit about a stock's fundamentals.
In a sane world, high-frequency trading would be a minor specialty at best. But in the bizarro world that Wall Street has become, such activity now makes up the majority of all trades. It is manufacturing risk while siphoning money and talent that growth-producing sectors of the economy need.
It has also sparked a technological arms race aimed at shaving milliseconds off each trade. New, more direct fiber optic cable routes have been laid between major trading cities, and now there are even serious proposals to position drone aircraft over the Atlantic Ocean to speed transmission times between New York and London.
USATODAY OPINION About Editorials/Debate Opinions expressed in USA TODAY's editorials are decided by its Editorial Board, a demographically and ideologically diverse group that is separate from USA TODAY's news staff. Most editorials are accompanied by an opposing view — a unique USA TODAY feature that allows readers to reach conclusions based on both sides of an argument rather than just the Editorial Board's point of view.
And what does all this mean for conventional investors? Nothing good. Just gobs of needless danger.
The biggest problem with high-frequency trading is that it greatly increases the chances of a major market crash. In 2010, the "flash crash" took the Dow Jones average down more than 1,000 points in a matter of minutes. Finding the cause — a single massive computerized trade made in error — took months.
Imagine, then, what might happen if the market started falling in response to a sudden event, such as an attack on Iran. The computers, which act on their own, would likely overwhelm the market with sell orders. Similar circumstances in 1987 caused a crash that took the Dow down 22.6% in a day and nearly crippled the entire financial system.
Today, the trade volume would be massively larger. Yet the regulatory response has been negligible, even as problems have continued. Just last month, a trading company called Knight Capital Group nearly collapsed after malfunctions in its computers sent the shares of 148 companies on wild rides.
Behind these events is a high-tech war fought among computer algorithms challenging each other for supremacy and unmindful of the destabilizing effect they are having. The growing concern they are causing was evident at a Senate hearing last week, and in a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Beyond the crash risk, these practices undermine the core purpose of markets, which is to raise capital in pursuit of enterprise, profit and economic growth.
That's not happening the way it used to. Even though the Dow is back above 13,000 and bond yields are low, investors have been pulling money out of stock mutual funds most of this year, according to the Investment Company Institute. And even sophisticated investors such as billionaire Mark Cuban say they're "terrified" about potential flash crashes triggered by high-frequency trading.
The traders argue that they add liquidity to markets that lowers transaction costs and eases dealing in thinly traded shares. There is some truth to this. But the negatives far outweigh the positives.
Next week, the Securities and Exchange Commission is holding a meeting to solicit ideas about what to do. Here's a simple one: Slap a small transaction tax on rapid trades, impeding the practice and returning markets to their core purpose.
That would be a big win for small investors, and the only people harmed would be those now putting everyone else at risk.
It's noisy but it seems to be working for now.
Not sure about reliable. There should be a maybe or don't know choice there. This drive seems to have a minor problem. It seems to enter a self test mode where it thrashes very loud and hard every 10 seconds or so and then stops that behavior for a little while. The S.M.A.R.T. report shows nothing out of sorts but it is still running some sort of test offline. Very annoying at night when trying to sleep. my roommate complains and it worries me. I may just go back to my old drive. The only workaround I have is to set it to some task like smartctl -t long to keep it busy. I noticed that long test has taken as long as 5 days to complete but it's only suppsed to take 29 hours to finish that test. So I think something is wrong but SMART can't quite see it. As long as it has a job to do it won't make that noise. Note the smartctl test does not produce that same noise so I don't know what it is that the drive feels it needs to be doing but it never satisfies it self. It's a shame in all other ways the drive seems fine but that noise is loud when it has a bad day. Loud and worrisome.Read full review

A survey of police staff has found 86 percent think frontline officers are under-resourced.

The two-yearly survey of about 5000 Police Association members, also found 74 percent of constables were dissatisfied with the number of frontline officers in their district.
The survey, which was carried out by research company Nielsen, also showed close to 30 percent of Association members believed frontline services could fail because of pressures on resources.
Police Association president Greg O'Connor said the figures reflected a change in the way police were tackling crime.
He said the police were focusing on prevention and stopping crime before it happened.
While Mr O'Connor said he supported that strategy, it did come at the expense of frontline officers.
"In Counties Manukau, where it was first trialled, it worked very well because they were given 300 extra staff to do it. In the rest of the country that very successful model has also been implemented, however with no further resource it means it had to come from somewhere, and it's come from frontline response," said Mr O'Connor.
He said it meant there were fewer officers available to attend the increasing number of calls police were getting, which was going up 10 percent each year.
He said that was often when mistakes happened, like the case of Iraena Asher, who disappeared from an Auckland beach in 2004, after police failed to show up when she called them concerned about her safety.
"As a result of that case police got a really good injection of resource but it took a tragedy for it to happen, we hope that it won't take a tragedy for it to happen and that police resourcing needs are recognised."
The survey was conducted last year and showed concerns about staffing were ranked the most important issue facing police.
Of the respondents, 86 percent felt general duty officers responding to emergency calls were under-resourced, and 74 percent of constables were dissatisfied with the number of frontline police staff in their district.
Despite the survey, police have denied their staff are under-resourced.
Deputy commissioner of district operations Grant Nicholls told Morning Report they were listening to staff, and staff hadn't been telling them about a lack of resources in recent workshops they had held.
"As a frontline constable operating in Palmerston North, I may have said 30 years ago that we were under-resourced and I could do with more - and there [were] moments when I probably thought that.
"But the reality is the resources are being allocated, they're being allocated well."
Mr Nicholls said if things were as bad as the Association's survey claimed, the attrition rate would be higher.
Labour Party spokesman for police Stuart Nash said the figures suggested there was a fundamental problem within the police force over staffing.
"When three out of four police believe there aren't enough police on the streets then we should really be concerned about it," said Mr Nash.
"If it was a small minority, if it was ten percent or even if it was 25 percent - then we'd say 'okay maybe there are some dissatisfied police men or women out there and we need to do something about their level of satisfaction', but it's different when it's 74 percent.
"You know I firmly believe that the men and the women on the ground, they work really really hard, but when you get 86 percent saying it's under-resourced, then we need to do something about that, and the government is in a prime position to do something."

I bought like 20 bags of Yo-kai Watch Medals for £30.
Story goes that I was gonna spend my Easter egg money on either Yo-kai Watch Medals or Pokémon cards instead of chocolate because I've kinda gone off the stuff. I went to my local supermarket and I was originally going to buy around £20 worth of Yokai medals since that was the only thing they had in stock. I took them to the self checkouts and they scanned for £1.50 instead of £3.00. OH SHIT. I ran back home, dropped off my shopping and came back and bought about 11 more packs so I spent a total of £30 on plastic toy medals. Here's photos below and also QR codes for you lovely people (sorry if some of the photos are blurry!)
Zirconium silicate, a mineral belonging to the group of nesosilicates
This article is about the mineral. For other uses, see Zircon (disambiguation)
Zircon ( [6][7] or [8]) is a mineral belonging to the group of nesosilicates. Its chemical name is zirconium silicate, and its corresponding chemical formula is ZrSiO 4 . A common empirical formula showing some of the range of substitution in zircon is (Zr 1–y , REE y )(SiO 4 ) 1–x (OH) 4x–y . Zircon forms in silicate melts with large proportions of high field strength incompatible elements. For example, hafnium is almost always present in quantities ranging from 1 to 4%. The crystal structure of zircon is tetragonal crystal system. The natural color of zircon varies between colorless, yellow-golden, red, brown, blue and green. Colorless specimens that show gem quality are a popular substitute for diamond and are also known as "Matura diamond".
The name derives from the Persian zargun, meaning "gold-hued".[9] This word is corrupted into "jargoon", a term applied to light-colored zircons. The English word "zircon" is derived from Zirkon, which is the German adaptation of this word.[10] Yellow, orange and red zircon is also known as "hyacinth",[11] from the flower hyacinthus, whose name is of Ancient Greek origin.
Properties [ edit ]

Zircon is ubiquitous in the crust of Earth. It occurs as a common accessory mineral in igneous rocks (as primary crystallization products), in metamorphic rocks and as detrital grains in sedimentary rocks.[1] Large zircon crystals are rare. Their average size in granite rocks is about 0.1–0.3 mm, but they can also grow to sizes of several centimeters, especially in mafic pegmatites and carbonatites.[1] Zircon is also very resistant to heat and corrosion.
Because of their uranium and thorium content, some zircons undergo metamictization. Connected to internal radiation damage, these processes partially disrupt the crystal structure and partly explain the highly variable properties of zircon. As zircon becomes more and more modified by internal radiation damage, the density decreases, the crystal structure is compromised, and the color changes.
Zircon occurs in many colors, including reddish brown, yellow, green, blue, gray and colorless.[1] The color of zircons can sometimes be changed by heat treatment. Common brown zircons can be transformed into colorless and blue zircons by heating to 800 to 1000 °C.[12] In geological settings, the development of pink, red, and purple zircon occurs after hundreds of millions of years, if the crystal has sufficient trace elements to produce color centers. Color in this red or pink series is annealed in geological conditions above temperatures of around 400 °C.[13]
Applications [ edit ]
Sand-sized grains of zircon
Zircon is mainly consumed as an opacifier, and has been known to be used in the decorative ceramics industry.[14] It is also the principal precursor not only to metallic zirconium, although this application is small, but also to all compounds of zirconium including zirconium dioxide (ZrO 2 ), one of the most refractory materials known.
Other applications include use in refractories and foundry casting and a growing array of specialty applications as zirconia and zirconium chemicals, including in nuclear fuel rods, catalytic fuel converters and in water and air purification systems.[15]
Zircon is one of the key minerals used by geologists for geochronology.
Zircon is a part of the ZTR index to classify highly-weathered sediments.
Occurrence [ edit ]
World production trend of zirconium mineral concentrates
Zircon is a common accessory to trace mineral constituent of most granite and felsic igneous rocks. Due to its hardness, durability and chemical inertness, zircon persists in sedimentary deposits and is a common constituent of most sands. Zircon is rare within mafic rocks and very rare within ultramafic rocks aside from a group of ultrapotassic intrusive rocks such as kimberlites, carbonatites, and lamprophyre, where zircon can occasionally be found as a trace mineral owing to the unusual magma genesis of these rocks.
Zircon forms economic concentrations within heavy mineral sands ore deposits, within certain pegmatites, and within some rare alkaline volcanic rocks, for example the Toongi Trachyte, Dubbo, New South Wales Australia[16] in association with the zirconium-hafnium minerals eudialyte and armstrongite.
Australia leads the world in zircon mining, producing 37% of the world total and accounting for 40% of world EDR (economic demonstrated resources) for the mineral.[17] South Africa is Africa's main producer, with 30% of world production, second after Australia.[18]
Radiometric dating [ edit ]
SEM-CL image of Zircon grain showing zonations and poly-cycles (core-rim structure)
Zircon has played an important role during the evolution of radiometric dating. Zircons contain trace amounts of uranium and thorium (from 10 ppm up to 1 wt%) and can be dated using several modern analytical techniques. Because zircons can survive geologic processes like erosion, transport, even high-grade metamorphism, they contain a rich and varied record of geological processes. Currently, zircons are typically dated by uranium-lead (U-Pb), fission-track, cathodoluminescence, and U+Th/He techniques. For instance, imaging the cathodoluminescence emission from fast electrons can be used as a prescreening tool for high-resolution secondary-ion-mass spectrometry (SIMS) to image the zonation pattern and identify regions of interest for isotope analysis. This is done using an integrated cathodoluminescence and scanning electron microscope.[19] Zircons in sedimentary rock can identify the sediment source.
Zircons from Jack Hills in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane, Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia, have yielded U-Pb ages up to 4.404 billion years,[20] interpreted to be the age of crystallization, making them the oldest minerals so far dated on Earth. In addition, the oxygen isotopic compositions of some of these zircons have been interpreted to indicate that more than 4.4 billion years ago there was already water on the surface of the Earth.[20][21] This interpretation is supported by additional trace element data,[22][23] but is also the subject of debate.[24][25] In 2015, "remains of biotic life" were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in the Jack Hills of Western Australia.[26][27] According to one of the researchers, "If life arose relatively quickly on Earth ... then it could be common in the universe."[26]

Indonesia is preparing a plan to construct a new military base in the disputed South China Sea.
Indonesia is developing a plan to build a new military base in the South China Sea, according to local media reports.
On Friday, the Jakarta Post reported that Indonesian officials are preparing a plan to build a new military base somewhere in the South China Sea, which has seen an uptick in tensions over competing sovereignty claims. The report said Indonesia's Defense Ministry and the The National Development Planning Board (Bappenas) held a meeting on Friday to discuss the potential locations for such a base.
“Our meeting today is aimed at synchronizing our ambition to guard the national interest and protect the sovereignty of our territory,” Bappenas chief Andrinof Chaniago was quoted as saying in the report.
“The findings from the team will be conveyed to President Jokowi [Joko Widodo], who will make his decision. We hope that in the near future, the plan will be realized,” he added.
(Recommended: Exposed: Singapore's Aircraft Carrier in Disguise )
Among the places being considered, according to Andrinof, are areas in Sambas, West Kalimantan; Natuna Islands, Riau Islands and Tarakan, North Kalimantan.
Indonesia's Defense Minister, Ryamizard Ryacudu, who previously served as Army Chief of Staff, expressed his support for the proposed military base.
“I previously worked in West Kalimantan and I believe that building a military base in that territory is a very good decision. We have natural resources that we need to guard,” he said, according to the report.
Indonesia isn't an official participant in the South China Sea disputes, however, in the past China's nine-dash line maps of sovereignty have included Indonesia's Natuna Islands. This has been met by sharp rebukes from Indonesian officials.
(Recommended: Asia Beware: China Unveils New Island Storming Warships )
“China has claimed Natuna waters as their territorial waters. This arbitrary claim is related to the dispute over Spratly and Paracel Islands between China and the Philippines. This dispute will have a large impact on the security of Natuna waters,” assistant deputy to the chief security minister for defense strategic doctrine, Commodore Fahru Zaini said , in March of last year during a trip to the Natuna area.
He added: “What China has done is related to the territorial zone of the Unitary Republic of Indonesia. Therefore, we have come to Natuna to see the concrete strategy of the main component of our defense, namely the National Defense Forces (TNI).”
Around the same time, Indonesia's Military Chief General Moeldoko took to the Wall Street Journal to blast China's claims. “Indonesia is dismayed… that China has included parts of the Natuna Islands within the nine-dash line, thus apparently claiming a segment of Indonesia's Riau Islands province as its territory,” Moeldoko wrote .
(Recommended: China's New Trump Card in the South China Sea )
He went on to write: “The Indonesian military has decided to strengthen its forces on Natuna. We will need also to prepare fighter planes to meet any eventuality stemming from heightened tensions on one of the world's key waterways.”
More recently, in February of this year, General Moeldoko referred to the South China Sea as a potential flashpoint. “In the future, we expect that the South China Sea will be a flash point. So a task force, such as the Kogabwilhan, will be very important,” Moeldoko said in an interview.
Indonesia's popular president, Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, has also waded into the dispute from time to time. For example, just before a trip to Japan and China in March of this year, Jokowi said “The ‘nine-dashed line' that China says marks its maritime border has no basis in any international law.”
Outside observers have regularly pegged Indonesia as a potential leader of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the organization's secretariat is indeed located in the country. Thus, Indonesia's position on the South China Sea dispute carries particular weight.
However, Indonesia has tried to take a balanced approach on the issue, and Jokowi reaffirmed in March that Indonesia seeks to remain an "honest broker" in the dispute.

We're off out to a party for my friend's 40th birthday this evening and we had a whole bunch of stuff in the fridge, including some chicken breasts, which needed eating by today, so I decided to try this little concoction of the various different things! I don't know about you, but I hate going on a night out feeling bloated and full, so on the rare occasion that I go, we tend to eat our main meal at lunch time, so I've chucked all of this in the slow cooker at 9am, to be ready for around 1pm.
Here's how I did it:
Slow Cooker Creamy Garlic Chicken with Mushrooms and Bacon Print Prep time 5 mins Cook time 2 hours Total time 2 hours 5 mins Slow cooked chicken in a creamy garlic sauce with mushrooms and bacon, perfect served with pasta or potatoes. Author: Jayne Crammond Recipe type: Slow Cooker Serves: 4 Ingredients 500g chicken breast
Mushrooms (around half a punnet)
One pack of unsmoked bacon lardons
One tub of Philadelphia (or other cream cheese)
Garlic powder Instructions Place the chicken breasts in the slow cooker Chop the mushrooms into quarters and layer on top of the chicken Brown the lardons in a pan until lightly golden then place in the slow cooker Sprinkle garlic powder over the chicken, bacon and mushrooms, a little or a lot depending on your taste (we like a lot!) Gently spread the cream cheese across the top of the rest of the ingredients Place the lid on the slow cooker and cook on low for 4 hours or high for 2 hours Serve with pasta or potatoes of your choice 3.5.3208
Given the fact that this was basically just a “chuck it all in and hope for the best” recipe, it actually came out really well and was stupidly easy to make. The girls absolutely loved it (Sausage said “Mum, is this your secret sauce because it is DELICIOUS!”) and it's definitely one that will make it into our regular rotation. We had ours with pasta as it was the quickest option for today, but it would also go really nicely with new potatoes or even mash and possbily some broccoli or asparagus on the side.
Intel has announced its new SSD brand Optane at Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco. The new, insanely fast SSD's will launch as early as next year.
Intel's new 3D XPoint technology is also coming in DIMM memories for Xeon processors. The 3D XPoint is going to be available in both PCIe SSD and DIMM memories next year and they are sold under the brand Optane. The products will be available for servers, desktops and laptops.
Intel claims that the new 3D XPoint technology has 1000 times the speed and endurance of the currently used NAND technology and it's 10 times denser than DRAM. According to the keynote, the early Optane prototype easily beats Intel's current flagship SSD, P3700. The IOps benchmarks revealed that the Optane prototype is a good 7 times faster.
The new technology really puts pressure to other manufacturers. The speed the new Optane has, is going to allow all new possibilities when it comes to demanding game graphics and real-time data analytics.

As part of its series on anarchy and democracy, CrimethInc posted a piece by Uri Gordon, “Democracy: The Patriotic Temptation,” in which he highlights the perils of promoting anarchy as the only genuine form of democracy. I have left out the historical introduction, where Gordon summarizes the anarchist critique of democracy that goes back at least to Proudhon. However, I disagree that “the association between anarchism and democracy makes its appearance only around the 1980s, through the writings of Murray Bookchin.” While it is true that Bookchin made great efforts to associate anarchism with direct democracy (starting in the 1960s, in essays like “The Forms of Freedom,” excerpts from which are included in Volume Two of Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas), at times even 19th century anarchists, particularly Proudhon himself, associated anarchy with forms of direct democracy. Drawing on the heritage of direct democracy that came to the fore during the French Revolution and was carried on by workers' associations well into the 19th century, Proudhon advocated voluntary federations of directly democratic functional groups, with the delegates to the various federations being subject to imperative mandates and recall should they violate their mandates, much the same sort of direct democracy that Bookchin advocated in the 1960s (although even then Bookchin put much more emphasis on community assemblies than Proudhon ever did).
Other anarchists, such as Joseph Déjacque, also advocated forms of direct democracy (I included selections from Déjacque's writings in Volume One of Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas). The anarchists in the First International argued that the International should be organized on “federalist” lines, with the delegates to the International's congresses, and the members of the General Council themselves, subject to imperative mandates from and recall by the sections of the International that had delegated them. Marx and his cohorts, despite the Marxist propaganda regarding his alleged support for direct democracy (based on the misconception that the government of the Paris Commune was some kind of direct democracy, when it was actually a representative form of government), opposed any attempts to require the members of the General Council to be delegated by the member sections of the International, and expressly attacked the anarchists' advocacy of direct democracy within the International at the 1872 Hague Congress, where they ridiculed the anarchists' insistence that delegates follow the mandates given to them by the sections that had delegated them to attend the Congress. I review this history in some detail in ‘We Do Not Fear Anarchy – We Invoke It': The First International and the Origins of the Anarchist Movement.
Selling Anarchism as Democracy
Essentially, the association of anarchism with democracy is a two-pronged rhetorical maneuver intended to increase the appeal of anarchism for mainstream publics. The first component of the maneuver is to latch onto the existing positive connotations that democracy carries in established political language. Instead of the negative (and false) image of anarchism as mindless and chaotic, a positive image is fostered by riding on the coattails of “democracy” as a widely-endorsed term in the mass media, educational system, and everyday speech. The appeal here is not to any specific set of institutions or decision-making procedures, but to the association of democracy with freedom, equality, and solidarity—to the sentiments that go to work when democracy is placed in binary opposition to dictatorship, and celebrated as what distinguishes the “free countries” of the West from other regimes.
Yet the second component of the maneuver is subversive: it seeks to portray current capitalist societies as not, in fact, democratic, since they alienate decision-making power from the people and place it in the hands of elites. This amounts to an argument that the institutions and procedures that mainstream audiences associate with democracy—government by representatives—are not in fact democratic, or at least a very pale and limited fulfilment of the values they are said to embody. True democracy, in this account, can only be local, direct, participatory, and deliberative, and is ultimately achievable only in a stateless and classless society. The rhetorical aim of the maneuver as a whole is to generate in the audience a sense of indignation at having been deceived: while the emotional attachment to “democracy” is confirmed, the belief that it actually exists is denied.
Now there are two problems with this maneuver, one conceptual and one more substantive. The conceptual problem is that it introduces a truly idiosyncratic notion of democracy, so ambitious as to disqualify almost all political experiences that fall under the common understanding of the term—including all electoral systems in which representatives do not have a strict mandate and are not immediately recallable. By claiming that current “democratic” regimes are in fact not democratic at all and that the only democracy worthy of the name is actually some version of an anarchist society, anarchists are asking people to reconfigure their understanding of democracy in a rather extreme way. While it is possible to maintain this new usage with logical coherence, it is nevertheless so rarefied and contrary to the common usage that its potential as a pivot for mainstream opinion is highly questionable.
The second problem is graver. While the association with democracy may seek to appeal only to its egalitarian and libertarian connotations, it also entangles anarchism with the patriotic nature of the pride in democracy which it seeks to subvert. The appeal is not simply to an abstract design for participatory institutions, but to participatory institutions recovered from the American revolutionary tradition. Bookchin (1985) is quite explicit about this, when he calls on anarchists to “start speaking in the vocabulary of the democratic revolutions” while unearthing and enlarging their libertarian content:
That [American] bourgeois past has libertarian features about it: the town meetings of New England. Municipal and local control, the American mythology that the less government the better, the American belief in independence and individualism. All these things are antithetical to a cybernetic economy, a highly centralized corporative economy and a highly centralized political system… I'm for democratizing the republic and radicalizing the democracy, and doing that on the grass roots level: that will involve establishing libertarian institutions which are totally consistent with the American tradition. We can't go back to the Russian Revolution or the Spanish revolution any more. Those revolutions are alien to people in North America.
Cindy Milstein's formulation in her article “Democracy is Direct” (Milstein 2000) works directly to fulfil this program by seeking to build on American origin myths:
Given that the United States is held up as the pinnacle of democracy, it seems particularly appropriate to hark back to those strains of a radicalized democracy that fought so valiantly and lost so crushingly in the American Revolution. We need to take up that unfinished project… Like all the great modern revolutions, the American Revolution spawned a politics based on face-to-face assemblies confederated within and between cities… Those of us living in the United States have inherited this self-schooling in direct democracy, even if only in vague echoes… deep-seated values that many still hold dear: independence, initiative, liberty, equality. They continue to create a very real tension between grassroots self-governance and top-down representation.
The appeal to the consensus view of the American polity as founded in a popular and democratic revolution, genuinely animated by freedom and equality, is precisely intended to target existing patriotic sentiments, even as it emphasises their subversive consequences. Milstein even invokes Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address when she criticises reformist agendas which “work with a circumscribed and neutralized notion of democracy, where democracy is neither of the people, by the people, nor for the people, but rather, only in the supposed name of the people.” Yet this is a dangerous move, since it relies on a self-limiting critique of the patriotic sentiment itself, and allows the foundation myths to which it appeals to remain untouched by critiques of manufactured collective identity and colonial exclusion. While noting the need not whitewash the racial, gendered, and other injustices that were part of “the historic event that created this country,” Milstein can only offer an unspecific exhortation to “grapple with the relation between this oppression and the liberatory moments of the American Revolution.”
Yet given that the appeal is targeted at non-anarchist participants, there is little if any guarantee that such a grappling would actually take place. The patriotic sentiment appealed to here is more often than not a component of a larger nationalist narrative, one that hardly partakes of a decolonial critique (which by itself would have many questions about the Western enlightenment roots of notions of citizenship and the public sphere). The celebration of democracy in terms that directly invoke the early days of the American polity may end up reinforcing rather than questioning loyalties to the nation-state that claims, however falsely, to be the carrier of the democratic inheritance of the colonial period. This is especially poignant in the context of the recent wave of mobilization, which displays precisely this mix of quintessentially anarchist-influenced means of organization and action, and distinctly patriotic and nationalist discourses—from the Egyptian revolution's embrace of the military, through the Jeffersonian sentiments pervading the Occupy movement, and on to the outright nationalism of the Ukrainian revolution.
There is, indeed, one reason to question this concern—namely, the democratic and nationalist sentiments that have been expressed by movements with which anarchists have good reasons to sense an affinity. The most prominent of these are the struggles of communities in Chiapas linked to the Zapatista Army of National Liberation in southeast Mexico and the revolutionary movement in Rojava or Syrian Kurdistan. Both have not only employed the language of democracy to signify a decentralised and egalitarian form of society, but also an explicit agenda of national liberation. The Kurdish movement has publicly endorsed Bookchin as a source of inspiration. Does this mean that anarchists are wrong to maintain active solidarity with these movements? My answer is “No”—but due to a crucial difference that also vindicates the general argument above. It is not the same thing for stateless minorities in the global South to use the language of democracy and national liberation as it is for citizens of advanced capitalist countries in which national independence is already an accomplished fact. The former do not appeal to patriotic founding myths engendered by an existing nation state, with their associated privileges and injustices, but to the possibility of a different and untested form of radically decentralised and potentially stateless “national liberation.” To be sure, this carries its own risks, but anarchists in the global North are hardly in a position to preach on these matters.
Thus we return to the main point: for anarchists in the USA and Western Europe, at least, the choice to use the language of democracy is based on the desire to mobilize and subvert a form of patriotism that is ultimately establishment-friendly; it risks cementing the nationalist sentiments it seeks to undermine. Anarchists have always had a public image problem. Trying to undo it through the connection to mainstream democratic and nationalist sentiments is not worth this risk.

It won't be long until the Galaxy S8 is officially unveiled and we already know the design is so stylish it already looks like one of 2017's best and most exciting smartphones. But now two potential dealbreakers have leaked this week…
dealbreaker #1: Invasive Samsung Branding
One of the highlights of the Galaxy S8 is that fact it fits a much larger screen into a chassis no larger than the Galaxy S7 thanks to super slim top and bottom bezels. Yet Samsung might be about to waste this screen space.
According to a tweet by Evan Blass (aka evleaks), arguably the world's most famous leaker, the narrowness of the Galaxy S8 bezels means Samsung won't be able to fit its branding onto them. But minimalist fans should not rejoice because Blass says the company is planning what would surely be a hugely unpopular workaround: “the top 1/4" of screen will be hard-coded to display SAMSUNG”.
If true, this is being completely ridiculous and counteract the entire point of slimming down the Galaxy S8's bezels in the first place. I hope Blass is joking, but he is rarely one to post deliberately bogus information or troll his followers.
Update: Perhaps Blass was deliberately trolling based on his latest update. Let's hope so!
dealbreaker #2: A Bizarre, Awkward Fingerprint Reader
For some time there has been growing excitement that the Galaxy S8 will ditch its home button and integrate the fingerprint sensor into the screen. Why? Firstly because the super slim bezels are too thin to fit one and secondly because it'll look amazing. Furthermore LG has been promoting the commercial viability of such technology since May 2016.
But it now appears Samsung has missed the boat. Recent leaks show the Galaxy S8 will simply reposition the fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone (some hate this, I love it) yet the real irritation is precisely where.
Common sense has seen smartphone makers put rear fingerprint sensors where your index finger can easily reach, but instead Blass tweets that it will be positioned at the top of the phone beside the rear camera. This is stupid not only because it is hard to reach, but also because it means you're going to accidentally touch the camera lens all the time which will require regular wiping if you don't want to snap blurry photos.
Too Good To Be True?
Some have said recent leaks of the Galaxy S8 were too good to be true and daft decisions like those above would certainly show Samsung is capable of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. But don't panic just yet.
For starters, if Samsung is mad enough to emblazon its logo on the display then a software update could remove it should there be inevitable customer backlash. Furthermore leaked shots which corroborate the silly placement of the fingerprint sensor may be early prototypes and multiple leaked case renders last week showed no cutout for a rear fingerprint sensor so perhaps the final Galaxy S8 does indeed have it integrated into the display?
Either way, even with the recent release delay, there's not long until we find out…

The House Ways and Means committee is beginning to debate whether to let the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy expiry at the end of this year.
There will be the usual carping about how this would hurt the economy, punish the successful, kill the geese that lay the golden eggs. But some of the geese think it's a good idea.
It's not surprising that 60 percent of all Americans support raising taxes on households with incomes over $250,000, according Quinnipiac University poll.
What's curious is some of the people who will pay these higher taxes also agree. The Quinnipiac poll reveals that 64 percent of those with incomes over $250,000 support the tax hike. This is echoed by the unusual voices of retired CEOs, current business leaders and small business owners, many of them affiliated with Wealth for the Common Good, a network concerned about tax fairness that I co-founded.
They don't sound like they're fomenting class warfare. If anything, they are waxing poetic and patriotic.
"I hope Congress has the courage to let my tax cut expire," wrote Gene Mulligan, an investment manager from Alexandria, Va., in a syndicated column. "Our nation has built a remarkable marketplace for enterprise and wealth creation. Taxes paid for the public investments in research, education, infrastructure and technology that made this possible. They paid for law enforcement and orderly marketplaces. These public investments buoyed my personal opportunities and wealth. I am certain they have done the same for millions of other Americans."
Arul Menezes, a principal architect at Microsoft, wrote in an op-ed for that was published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer that the meritocratic system and infrastructure that made his entrepreneurial success possible is eroding. "Our investment as citizens in our collective "commons" lays the foundation for our individual wealth and success. Taxes are the price we pay to live in a civilized and healthy society. Those of us who have disproportionately benefited from public investments have a responsibility to pay back our society so that others can have similar opportunities."
Edgar Bronfman, the retired Chairman of Seagrams, who pushed the conversation along with an article in HuffPost said, "In the midst of an economic crisis, Americans are aware of who gets bailed out and who doesn't. The economy needs everyone's optimism, initiative, and resolve to get through bad times together. For the past eight years the wealthy have gotten wealthier. Now it's our turn to pay the piper and help build a more moral America."
More than 300 higher income taxpayers have signed a public petition calling on Congress and President Obama to let the tax cuts expire. These include Bernard Rapoport, Chairman Emeritus, American Income Life Insurance Co.; Chuck Denny, Jr., retired CEO, ADC Communications; John Steel, attorney and former mayor of Telluride, Colo.; Paul Grundy, IBM Corporation's Global Director, IBM Healthcare Transformation; and Julie Johnson, Managing Director, Fresh Pond Capital.
A signer to the petition, Todd B. Achilles, Managing Member of Balius Ventures LLC, said, "It is fundamental to our American values that we have a strong meritocracy which provides equality of opportunity to all Americans. Ensuring that everyone has an opportunity to be successful and pursue their dreams means ensuring that each and every American contributes appropriately to the nation's well-being."
According to a new report from Wealth for the Common Good, Shifting Responsibility, the wealthy have received massive tax cuts not just under President George W. Bush, but for decades before. Since 1960, the share of household income that middle class households paid in federal taxes has increased slightly, from 15.9 to 16.1 percent. But America's wealthiest taxpayers have seen their tax outlays, as a share of income, drop by almost half. The top 1 percent of taxpayers, those with incomes starting at $2 million, saw the share of income paid in federal taxes decline from 60 to 33.6 percent between 1960 and 2004.
During President Bush's eight years in office, Congress expanded tax cuts to Americans with incomes over $250,000. We had to add another $700 billion to the national debt to cover them.
"It's time to rebalance the tax code," said Ken Lewis, retired President of Lasco Shipping Company. "If we extend the Bush tax cuts for people of my income level, it will add an estimated $826 billion over the next decade. This would be very irresponsible. In my global travels, I've seen that societies that do not have functioning and fair tax systems have lower standards of living, poorer public services and less economic mobility and opportunity."

David James has predicted Manchester City will miss out on the top four this season after claiming they are the “weakest link” among the title contenders.
Former City keeper James reckons the whole club's philosophy is wrong and that they got LUCKY by “tripping over the line” to win their two Premier League titles.
James believes Liverpool - another of his old employers - will be the surprise package this season, and claims they will knock City out of the top four despite another summer of big spending at the Etihad.
City boss Manuel Pellegrini did a £49m deal — a record for an Englishman — for Raheem Sterling, also signed Fabian Delph and Patrick Roberts and is still in the market for Wolfsburg's £50m-rated Kevin De Bruyne.
It would seem unthinkable for mega-rich City not to be challenging for the title again in the campaign which starts on Saturday, let alone missing out on the top four entirely — although their collapse at the end of last season did raise some serious doubts about Pellegrini.

And James believes that while the Mancunian Blues have got big problems ahead, Liverpool have addressed their weaknesses by replacing two members of manager Brendan Rodgers' backroom team.
“I generally think Man City of the top four are the weak link,” said former England keeper James.
“Man City, again, they have got all this talent, they have won the title twice — or rather tripped over the line twice.
“Look at Chelsea last season. The title was won in November. If Arsenal had started better, I think Chelsea would have carried on longer just to win the league by ten, 15 points, whatever.
“I don't see the Man City model being right, just spending loads of money and acquiring players. It isn't necessarily the model of continued success. I have seen changes elsewhere and at the moment I am not seeing that at Man City. It is just spent a bit more and expect success.”
James, talking at the launch of BT Sport's new Premier League coverage, expects Liverpool to push City out of the top four.
Assistants Colin Pascoe and Mike Marsh have gone to make way for Sean O'Driscoll and Gary McAllister in Rodgers' staff at Anfield.
Flashback — Liverpool beat City 2-1 in March:
James believes this new set-up will be successful, and will also help Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet — who he says is one of the best at the position in the Premier League.
He said of Liverpool: “I am not one of the owners but if you look at the whole business model there is a flaw somewhere and, at the moment, they might think it is at the coaching level.
“I think this is the season of the coach. I think with the new coaches they have a great chance of qualifying for the Champions League at the expense of Man City.
“I am encouraged Liverpool have changed the coaching staff. No disrespect to the other people. The acquisition of so many players to Liverpool and no success, there has to be a reason for that. I think it is environmental, it is not recruitment.
“Now, with the new coaching staff, Liverpool will be winning far more games and the onus on Mignolet won't be as acute. Statistically, he has been one of the high performers in the Premier League.
“That's not to say as a Premier League keeper you should expect not to have to do too much work - when I signed for Liverpool, I fell into the trap that I wouldn't be that busy as Liverpool were one of the best sides in Europe. Then suddenly I am out of the side because I let in too many goals.
poll loading Who'll be higher in the final Prem table? 2000+ VOTES SO FAR Liverpool Man City
"Liverpool haven't won the league since 1990 — 25 years. But, using my brief experience as a manager in India, you work out what you do and what you let others do and Brendan has had three years where he's done what he has wanted to do.
“I would argue now he is probably looking at a different way of doing it, otherwise the coaches wouldn't have been replaced. You can't spend £250m on players and have no success.”

EXCLUSIVE: CM PUNK TESTED FOR STARRING ROLE IN STARZ DRAMA
Several months ago, pro wrestling-centric drama Heels was being fast tracked by The Starz Network and ParamountTV, planned for an eight episode first season.
The one hour drama, which has been attempting to cast its lead stars for several months, is built around the story two brothers, one a babyface and the other a heel in the ring, and the struggles they have on camera and behind the scenes after the death of their father, the promoter of the Georgia-based wrestling promotion they both worked for.
PWInsider.com has learned that former WWE champion turned UFC fighter CM Punk impressed casting directors so much that he tested for the series for the role of the heel brother, Jack Spade, earlier this month. Testing is the final step before being offered the role.
Unfortunately, PWInsider.com has learned that after several months of casting (including at one point, hopes from producers that they would cast Henry Cavill and Jack Reynor as the leads, which did not happen), Heels has been put on hold by the producers.
It should be noted that since being announced last February, the project has been on hold several times, so it's possible that if/when it is resurrected that Punk will still be in the mix. Currently, only a pilot script, Michael Waldron, has been written.

Turkey's prime minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, has compared his Israeli counterpart Binyamin Netanyahu to the Islamist militants whose attacks in Paris left 17 dead, saying both have committed crimes against humanity.
Davutoğlu said Israel's bombardments of Gaza and its deadly assault on a Turkish-led aid convoy headed there in 2010 were on a par with the Paris attacks, whose dead included shoppers at a Jewish supermarket.
The comments at a news conference escalated a war of words between the former allies: on Wednesday Israel's far-right foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, called the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, an “antisemitic bully” after Erdoğan criticised Netanyahu's attendance at a Paris solidarity march on Sunday.
On Thursday Erdoğan's spokesman issued a statement saying it was Islamophobic and unacceptable for Netanyahu to link the Paris bloodshed to Islam. “The Israeli government must halt its aggressive and racist policies instead of attacking others and sheltering behind antisemitism,” said his spokesman Ibrahim Kalin.
Turkey has condemned the Paris attacks but also warned that rising Islamophobia in Europe risks inflaming unrest.
Davutoğlu also attended the Paris rally, which he said was a march against terrorism. He said on Thursday: “Just as the massacre in Paris committed by terrorists is a crime against humanity, Netanyahu, as the head of the government that kills children playing on the beach with the bombardment of Gaza, destroys thousands of homes … and that massacred our citizens on an aid ship in international waters, has committed crimes against humanity.”
The assault on the aid convoy, in which 10 Turks were killed, ruptured relations between Turkey and Israel, which previously enjoyed close diplomatic and military ties. Trade links remain close.
Israel fought a 50-day war with the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip last year, during which Israeli shelling and air strikes caused widespread devastation in the territory and Hamas fired thousands of rockets into Israel. More than 2,100 Palestinians died, mostly civilians, Gaza medical officials said, while the Israeli death toll was 73, mostly soldiers.
“If Israel is looking for a bully, it needs to look in the mirror,” said Davutoğlu, whose Islamist-rooted AK party has held power in Turkey for more than a decade. Last October the Israeli defence minister Moshe Yaalon accused Ankara of sponsoring terrorism, citing what he said was a Hamas base of operations in Turkey, and argued that this was incompatible with its membership in Nato.
Davutoğlu also criticised the Turkish secular newspaper Cumhuriyet for publishing excerpts of Charlie Hebdo's latest edition, saying freedom of the press did not extend to insulting religious values – a crime punishable by jail in Turkey. Prosecutors in Istanbul have opened an investigation into the newspaper's decision.
“Freedom of press does not include insulting the prophet,” Davutoğlu said. “People who may tolerate insulting an individual will clearly not respond with the same degree when it is against the prophet. Since Turkey has such a sensitivity, publishing a cartoon that aims to insult the prophet is a clear incitement.”
Police secured the premises of Cumhuriyet after threats were made against the newspaper. A Turkish court has ordered four websites that featured an image of Muhammad on the Charlie Hebdo cover to be blocked.
On Wednesday violence erupted at an Islamist paper, Yeni Akit, after it published negative images of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who toppled the Ottoman sultan and founded the secular republic in 1923. Ataturk is a national hero for most Turks. Yeni Akit said about 200 nationalists threw eggs and rocks and then tried to storm its offices before police intervened.
A Ferrari smashed into a power pole, knocking down power lines and paralyzing a stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu on Sunday.
The crash happened about a quarter-mile north of Sunset Boulevard shortly before 1:30 a.m.
Police said a 1999 Ferrari smashed through a power pole and crashed onto the beach some 30 feet below the road. The car was severed in two.
Detectives said both the 24-year-old driver and passenger, identified as 23-year-old Glendora resident Basil Max Price II, were thrown out of the Ferrari. One was killed, and the other was critically injured and rushed to the hospital.
The PCH was closed from Topanga Canyon Boulevard to Temescal Canyon Road for several hours but has since reopened.
Authorities say a high rate of speed likely was a factor in the crash. The accident was under investigation.

Outer Planet News
This post originally appeared on Van Kane's blog and is reposted here with permission.
NASA's Outer Planet Analysis Group is currently meeting to hear the agency's current plans and to provide the feedback of the scientific community on those plans.
Monday's presentations brought two pieces of news. First, in preparation for its Decadal Survey that will prioritize mission from 2023 to 2032, NASA has asked the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to review options for mission to Uranus and Neptune. The expectation is that following the large (Flagship) 2020 Mars rover and mid-2020 Europa missions, exploration of this planetary system will be the next priority for large missions. Any missions would likely arrive at these planets a decade or more after their launch.
The second piece of new was that NASA has selected two new planetary CubeSat missions. One will orbit the Moon, mapping water ice in permanently shadowed craters in preparation for human exploration. The other will stay in Earth orbit to be a micro-gravity laboratory to study the interactions of particles that eventually led to the formation of the planets.
I've placed copies of the slides from the meeting below. As I find out more details, I'll do dedicated posts in the future. All slides are from Jim Green's presentation; he's the head of NASA's Planetary Science Division.

“Extraordinary” science fiction writer Brian Aldiss died on Saturday (19th August) after celebrating his 92nd birthday the previous day.
The author was born in Norfolk in 1925 and began his published writing career as a columnist for The Bookseller whilst working as a sales assistant in a bookshop. This experience inspired his first novel, The Brightfount Diaries (originally published by Faber, 1955), after which he became literary editor of the Oxford Mail. Six decades later he celebrated his 90th birthday with another column for The Bookseller featuring a trip to the “awful tomorrow” with no books or Sauvignon Blanc.
Described as the "Grand Old Man of British science fiction" by the Guardian, Aldiss was also a poet, playwright, critic, memoirist and artist. He was published by Faber for many years – which encouraged him to pursue science fiction - before a long-standing relationship with Penguin Random House imprint, Jonathan Cape. His backlist is now shared between Gollancz and HarperCollins imprint Voyager.
Curtis Brown represented Aldiss for three decades and his agent Gordon Wise described him as a “particular joy to work with” in a special report for The Bookseller celebrating his 90th birthday in 2015.
Aldiss, who died in the early hours of Saturday morning, wrote around 100 books and more than 300 short stories altogether.
The author of Non-stop, Hothouse and Greybeard (all originally published Faber), Aldiss' works such as Helliconia Trilogy are seen by many as bridging the gap between classic science fiction and contemporary literature.
He was also a memoirist, notably basing his Horatio Stubbs saga on his wartime adventures in Burma and the Far East, as well as the autobiography The Twinkling of an Eye (HarperCollins).
A friend and drinking companion of Kingsley Amis and correspondent with C S Lewis and J R R Tolkien, Aldiss was a founding member of the Groucho Club in London and a judge on the 1981 Booker Prize. Awarded the Hugo Award for Science Fiction in 1962 and the Nebula Award in 1965, Aldiss' work was well received by the critics and earned a strong following in the US and in Britain as well as being widely translated into foreign languages. In later years his “cultured world view and enduring curiosity” led to him exploring the war against terror and the logistical difficulties of accommodating different terrestrial belief systems in space within his novels.
Among his short fiction are the Supertoys stories, adapted for film as "A.I", on which Aldiss collaborated with Stanley Kubrick for over a decade before its completion by Steven Spielberg.
Felicity Bryan, agent and chair of the Oxford-based Felicity Bryan Associates, described Aldiss as a “larger-than-life figure”.
She told The Bookseller: “He was he most wonderful friend… extraordinary man. He described himself as a ‘writing animal' and whatever happened, he would turn it into a story. He did that when his wife died and I wrote him a condolence letter and he said, ‘I am a writing animal so I am writing now about this'.
“He worked on the paper here, in Oxford…and his memoir was very funny. He did amazing theatricals too, we performed one in our house, he was a larger-than-life figure, and performed at the Oxford Literary Festival.”
Scott Pack, associate editor at Unbound, told The Bookseller that Aldiss was “unfailingly curious about the world around him”.
Pack met the author whilst he was publisher at former HarperCollins imprint, The Friday Project, which published more than 50 of Aldiss' backlist works in 2013.
Pack said: “I was hugely fortunate to work with Brian in his later years, re-issuing some of his early books as well as publishing new novels. I wasn't sure what to expect of him at first, and I wouldn't have been surprised to be faced with a cantankerous veteran author, but instead I encountered a warm, witty man who was passionate about storytelling and full of admiration for those who helped him to tell those stories.”
He added: “He was unfailingly curious about the world around him and always tremendously excited about the next thing he was going to write. I am going to miss Brian very much indeed.”
The HarperCollins imprint was wound down following Pack's departure in 2014 after which Aldiss was then published by fellow HarperCollins imprint, Voyager, working with Natasha Bardon, now publishing director.
Bardon told The Bookseller: "For the short time I had the pleasure of knowing Brian, there wasn't a moment when he wasn't writing something. His passion for language and literature was wonderful and he wielded his skill like a blade. Fiction, non-fiction, poetry: there was just no stopping him.
"Though I came to publish Brian later in his career, I feel the luckiest, because it wasn't just the fiction I heard about. Brian told the most incredible stories: of days when he and his contemporaries were writing books that would be become classics of the genre, of evenings out amongst other giants of literature and of much cheekier tales, always told with a smile and twinkle in his eye."
She added: "It is with great sadness that we say farewell to such a beloved author and I am so proud I was able to publish him even briefly."
Aldiss' second son, Tim, told The Bookseller that Aldiss had been active until the end. He said: “On his birthday he'd gone to the Ashmolean Museum restaurant with his partner, Alison, and his neighbour and he'd told me how busy it had been.
“He was often received as guest of honour at science fiction conventions, I remember fans always making a beeline for him. He was happy to talk about literature and was incredibly well read. When he got a job in a bookshop after the war, he read everything.”
Wise told The Bookseller it felt as though the Curtis Brown agency had lost a family member. He said: “The response to the news of Brian's passing has been spontaneous, caring, generous, wide-ranging and wise. Just like Brian himself. Here at Curtis Brown we've lost a cherished member of the family, and share his children Clive, Charlotte, Wendy and Tim, and his partner Alison's, sense of loss and of pride.”
Dr Samuel Fanous, head of publishing at the Bodleian Library Publishing, described the writer as a "truly remarkable man". He said: “We are all deeply saddened at this news and united in grief. Brian was to us an author, a friend, a colleague, and collaborator; a kindred spirit with whom we shared a common language.
“He was a truly remarkable man. A man of towering abilities and achievements...I feel so lucky to have known Brian, to have introduced him at the Oxford Literary Festival, to have lunched and dined and conversed with him, and to have counted him as a friend. His legacy is enormous. Wherever books are read, he will be mourned, there as he is here in Oxford and throughout the English speaking world.”
Aldiss' longtime US agent, Robin Straus of the Robin Straus Agency in New York, revealed that Aldiss had recently started working on a new story.
She said: “I became Brian's US literary agent in the early 1980s, and still marvel at his immense curiosity, boundless creativity, generosity of spirit, great personal warmth and zest for life. Just a few weeks ago, he mentioned he was working on a new story.
"A prolific writer of fiction, poetry, memoirs, illustrated diaries and history, he's been justly recognized with all the major SF awards. Brian was a beloved presence at conferences in America, where he entertained legions of SF and Fantasy fans and friends.
“His extraordinary work will continue to find readers, I'm sure, but he will be terribly missed.”
Writer Neil Gaiman tweeted the news from The Bookseller out to his 2.64m followers from his @neilhimself account: “This just hit me like a meteor to the heart…A larger than life wise writer.”
The author discussed Aldiss' legacy on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday (22nd August) and later tweeted: "An honour to talk about Brian Aldiss on @bbcradio4today. I wish I'd had time to talk about his kindness to young writers, and of his life."
Aldiss was awarded the OBE for services to literature in 2005.

New Jersey State Police said heroin seized in Middlesex County last month tested positive for the pesticide Carbaryl, which can cause loss of coordination and involuntary convulsions.
"As if there could possibly be one more reason to never, not ever, not even once take heroin, there's yet one more: Pesticide," State Police said in an announcement on their Facebook page.
Authorities said the substance was found in three separate brands of heroin in December, labeled "Level 10" with an image of syringes in purple ink, "Miracle" in red ink and "Top Chef" with an image of two butcher knives in red ink.
The pesticide was found alongside other substances more typically mixed with heroin.
Discovery of the pesticide is the latest in a slew of substances authorities have found in bags of heroin in New Jersey recently. Fentanyl, an opioid several times more powerful than heroin, has been found across the state in 2014 and 2015.
It was blamed for scores of overdose deaths in 2014.
Last month, NJ Advance Media revealed that at least 128,000 are addicted to heroin in New Jersey, and more than 5,200 have died since 2004.
Welcome to Herointown, New Jersey's 4th largest city.
The drug could cause complications in addition to the inherent danger of using heroin. Carbaryl, commonly sold under the moniker "Sevin," is a popular pesticide most commonly found in home gardening and agricultural products and is listed as a likely carcinogen by the Environmental Protection Agency.
Carbaryl exposure can occur through skin contact, inhalation, or ingestion and adversely affects the respiratory and central nervous systems.
Christie announces $100 million to battle heroin crisis in N.J.
According to the state police, symptoms of exposure may include nausea, stomach cramps, diarrhea, and excessive salivation. Other symptoms of high dosages may include sweating, blurring of vision, loss of coordination, and involuntary convulsions, the state police said.

The U.S.-led coalition targeting the Islamic State (ISIS) is being blamed for an airstrike on a school where families had sought shelter near the northern Syrian town of Raqqa.
The monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 33 people died as a result of the Tuesday strike.
Those using the school in the village of Mansoura as shelter "were displaced civilians from Raqqa, Aleppo, and Homs," Observatory head Rami Abdul Rahman said to Agence France-Presse.
"They're still pulling bodies out of the rubble until now. Only two people were pulled out alive," he said.
The activist-run group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, which also accused U.S.-led coalition jets of being behind the airstrike, said almost 50 families were seeking refuge at the school.
The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency also reported that the U.S. led coalition was responsible for the strike.
The Associated Press writes that it "was not immediately clear who carried out the airstrike," as
Syrian Kurdish forces have been advancing on Raqqa under the cover of U.S.-led coalition airstrikes and are now 8 kilometers (5 miles) north of the city. Syrian and Russian aircraft have also carried out strikes against the IS group.

CNN adds that ISIS-held Raqqa
is now largely surrounded, its main supply routes cut off by advancing forces. U.S.-backed Kurdish and Arab forces are squeezing ISIS from the north, while Syrian government troops—backed up by Russia—have been pushing from the west. The U.S.-led coalition against ISIS has also been carrying out airstrikes against the city.
The Pentagon said in a statement Wednesday that it has "no indication that an airstrike struck civilians near Raqqa as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claims," but that it would investigate. The Pentagon also said Monday that it was investigating claims that a U.S. airstrike last week killed dozens of civilians near a mosque in Aleppo, Syria.
The six years of war in Syria have killed 321,000 people, including 96,000 civilians, the Observatory said last week.
According to United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, the conflict is "the worst man-made disaster the world has seen since World War II," while UNICEF warned last week that Syrian children were facing "unprecedented" levels of suffering.
"Each and every child is scarred for life with horrific consequences on their health, well-being, and future," said UNICEF regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, Geert Cappelaere.
Update: The journal Discrete Analysis officially launched on 28 February 2016.
New journals spring up with overwhelming, almost tiresome, frequency these days. But Discrete Analysis is different. This journal is online only — but it will contain no papers. Rather, it will provide links to mathematics papers hosted on the preprint server arXiv. Researchers will submit their papers directly from arXiv to the journal, which will evaluate them by conventional peer review.
With no charges for contributors or readers, Discrete Analysis will avoid the commercial pressures that some feels are distorting the scientific literature, in part by reducing its accessibility, says the journal's managing editor Timothy Gowers, a mathematician at the University of Cambridge, UK, and a winner of the prestigious Fields Medal.
“Part of the motivation for starting the journal is, of course, to challenge existing models of academic publishing and to contribute in a small way to creating an alternative and much cheaper system,” he explained in a 10 September blogpost announcing the journal. “If you trust authors to do their own typesetting and copy-editing to a satisfactory standard, with the help of suggestions from referees, then the cost of running a mathematics journal can be at least two orders of magnitude lower than the cost incurred by traditional publishers.”
Discrete Analysis' costs are only $10 per submitted paper, says Gowers; money required to make use of Scholastica, software that was developed at the University of Chicago in Illinois for managing peer review and for setting up journal websites. (The journal also relies on the continued existence of arXiv, whose running costs amount to less than $10 per paper). A grant from the University of Cambridge will cover the cost of the first 500 or so submissions, after which Gower hopes to find additional funding or ask researchers for a submission fee.
Overlay journals
The idea of an 'overlay' journal that links to papers hosted on a preprint server is not new. There are arXiv overlay journals in maths already, such as SIGMA (Symmetry, Integrability and Geometry: Methods and Applications) and Logical Methods in Computer Science.
But Gowers' announcement is likely to widen interest in the idea because of his influence in the mathematics community — and outside it. Three years ago, for instance, a blogpost announcing Gowers' personal boycott of the Dutch publishing giant Elsevier, helped to spark the 'Cost of Knowledge' movement, which has seen more than 15,000 researchers variously pledging not to publish with, referee for or do editorial work for Elsevier.
And in 2013, Gowers announced his involvement with an initiative called the Episciences project, in which mathematicians decided to launch a series of overlay journals. That uses the multidisciplinary archive HAL, a preprint server that mirrors arXiv and is hosted in Lyon, France. One of its leaders, mathematician Jean-Pierre Demailly of the University of Grenoble in France, admits that progress has been sluggish. “Things have been slower than what we dreamed about three years ago — the technical development of the Episciences platform took about a year and a half longer than initially envisioned,” he says. “However things are now coming along nicely.” The initiative now has five or six staff members, Demailly says, and operates three computer-sciences journals and one in maths, which charge nothing to publish.
Episciences would have been a suitable platform to support Discrete Analysis too, Gowers says, but he happened to have sufficient funds to use the Scholastica software, and opted for that instead. “I hope that in due course people will get used to this publication model,” he adds, and that “the main interest in the journal will be the mathematics it contains”. Discrete Analysis will publish in a family of subjects related to additive combinatorics, including topics such as analytical and combinatorial number theory and the mathematical aspects of theoretical computer science. A temporary website has been created on the Scholastica platform to receive submissions, before the journal launches early next year.
Gower says that the model could be extended to other scientific fields. “For many subjects, where articles are almost purely text and nearly all authors know how to produce nice documents in LaTeX [a typesetting system commonly used by researchers], this model should work,” he says.
The question, perhaps, is how readily researchers will embrace the model. “Apart from being an arXiv overlay journal, our journal is very conventional, which I think is important so that mathematicians won't feel it is too risky to publish in it,” says Gowers. “But if the model becomes widespread, then I personally would very much like to see more-radical ideas tried out as well” — for example, post-publication review and non-anonymous referees.
The sad truth is that most stock brokers are sales people. While they have a more glamorous name, their profession is sales: selling investors like you on a product so they can get paid. And just like used-car salesmen, stock brokers have been known to make up a few stories every now and then. Here are a few key phrases to pay attention to so that you can avoid just being another commission.
“This is a great fund!”
Do they mention who this is a great fund for? Is it a great fund because it's performance is on par with the S&P500 for the last decade? Or is it a great fund because it's going to pay the broker a nice commission? Remember, just because it's a “no-load” fund doesn't mean that it is a no fee fund. Many funds now advertise themselves as being “no-load,” when in fact they've just changed from charging a “sales load” to a simple purchase fee or other fee.
When a stock broker is selling you on a mutual fund, you should make sure that it matches what you're looking for in a fund. Also, ask the broker for similar funds or ETFs, and why they think the fund they're recommending is the best. A good stock broker will present you will a category to invest in (such as large cap funds), and then usually highlight the top three to five funds, with regard to return and fees.
“This is a perfect investment for you!”
Most stock brokers aren't financial planners, so unless they've evaluated your entire portfolio, talked to you about your goals, and looked at your total estate plan, they really can't say that this investment is perfect for you.
Once again, make sure the investment really matches your needs. Many entry-level brokers are simply given a list of investment products to sell, and they just pitch them to you. They could be stocks, mutual funds, even annuities. Do your own research before committing to anything!
“I'm going to actively monitor your positions.”
Really? Because most stock brokers have hundreds of different clients and accounts, and they check each one about twice a year to see if they can make some money off of it by changing investment positions. Very rarely do stock brokers actually monitor your account once they've sold you. In fact, stock brokers don't even have a fiduciary duty to actively monitor your portfolio — their duty is limited to simply executing the trade.
Some brokers use automated portfolio management systems, but once again, the only time they'll be getting in touch is if they have a trade for you — and a corresponding commission for them.
If you are getting into an investment product that needs to be actively monitored, consider that a red flag. You're most likely going to a broker because you don't want to be trading stocks all day. As such, the broker should be looking at low cost index funds to balance your portfolio as a whole. Make sure that you're not getting someone who is going to be day-trading your money if you're not looking for that.
The Bottom Line
The bottom line is that most stock brokers have no incentive to take care of their clients beyond the simple order at hand; they're focused solely on generating gross commissions.
If you want someone to actually help you with your finances, and possibly point you in the direction of some mutual funds or ETFs that will suite your individual needs, you should look at spending some time with a fee-based financial planner. Their only incentive is to actually help you.

The Clintons have loomed large in Haiti for decades.
As Bill and Hillary Clinton ascended in the political world, their interest in Haiti — sparked by their 1975 honeymoon there — kept pace. They played key behind-the-scenes roles in Haiti presidential elections and publicly championed the Caribbean nation after the 2010 earthquake.
But that deep involvement in the politics of a foreign country wasn't always welcomed by Haitians or the diaspora. And now some Haitian-American voters are threatening to turn their backs on Hillary Clinton's Democratic presidential bid because they say the Clintons — and the Clinton Foundation — have not always done what's best for Haiti.
In sought-after Florida, where the race between Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump has remained tight, Clinton is finding that the Haitian-American vote is far from locked up.

“They know that the Haitian community has a beef with them,” said Dr. Laurinus “Larry” Pierre, head of the Democratic Haitian American Caucus of Florida and a prominent Democratic party fundraiser. “Mistakes were clearly made in Haiti. But at least with Hillary, we have some access.”
Haitian voters point out that Clinton hasn't visited Little Haiti, while Trump has. And though Clinton did meet with a handful of Haitian Americans before a Coral Springs rally Sept. 30 — five days before Hurricane Matthew hammered Haiti's southwestern peninsula — Pierre, who attended the meeting, said that wasn't enough: “I still asked Hillary if she could make a stop in the Haitian community.”
Pierre, who has been campaigning for Clinton as part of an effort by the political action committee Haitian Americans for Progress, says his message is simple: “If you don't vote, it's like you vote for Trump and if Trump is elected, we have no access.”
Still, it's a hard sell for some.
The traditionally Democratic-leaning community isn't necessarily flocking to Trump, who has tried to make Haiti a symbol of what he calls Hillary Clinton's “crooked” behavior in hopes of diluting the black vote, particularly in Florida. But Haitian-American voters also aren't giving Clinton the kind of support other Democratic candidates are accustomed to in an election where every vote is critical.

Grassroots outreach
The Clinton campaign insists it isn't taking the Haitian-American vote for granted. It has focused on reaching Haitian-American voters with efforts that include a Little Haiti field office and two Creole-language radio ads. Its media buy on Haitian radio, the campaign says, is larger than President Barack Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns.
“We're proud of our extensive grassroots outreach to the Haitian community here in Florida to register and ultimately turn out voters in support of Hillary Clinton this election,” said Cassandra Theramene, who is in charge of engaging the Haitian community statewide to get Clinton and other Democrats on the ballot elected. “Hillary Clinton understands that Haitian Americans have helped build this country and strengthen our communities — and she has a plan to create good-paying jobs with rising incomes, provide a world-class education for every child and pass comprehensive immigration reform to help keep Haitian families together.”
At least one Haiti expert, Robert Maguire at George Washington University, says Clinton's image when it comes to Haiti is pretty much set, for better or worse.
“I'm not sure there is much she could say at this point that would make any difference in terms of how her engagement with Haiti is perceived,” he said.
Some of the antipathy toward the Clintons is rooted in half truths, rumors and falsehoods like Trump's claim at a Panama City campaign rally earlier this month that the couple used $400 million in U.S. taxpayer dollars and aid “to build what amounted to a massive sweatshop” in northern Haiti, an assertion rated by the Washington Post as a distortion of the facts. Others have falsely claimed on social media and in private conversations that the Clinton Foundation ripped off billions of dollars in aid pledged after Haiti's devastating Jan. 12, 2010, earthquake.
But there are also legitimate frustrations and criticism over the power couple's gaffes in dealing with Haiti, such as the U.S. trade policy under former President Bill Clinton that forced Haiti to drop its tariffs on imported subsidized U.S. rice. The policy, which Clinton apologized for in 2010 while serving as United Nations envoy for Haiti, killed Haiti's local rice market.
And then there is the failed promise by Bill Clinton — the public face of the earthquake recovery and reconstruction effort as co-chair of the Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission while his wife, as secretary of state, directed the U.S. response and policy toward Haiti — to help the country “build back better” after the disaster.
Frustrations over the lack of progress in Haiti have caused some in and out of Haiti to protest against the couple, and Trump has sought to make the most of the frustrations. During the third and final presidential debate, he told voters that Haitians in Miami's Little Haiti neighborhood “hate the Clintons because of what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation.”
Ralph Kenol, a Haitian-American attorney and Democrat from Broward County who cast his ballot during early voting, said he went with the green party candidate instead of Clinton. He said the Clintons, like the Democratic Party, have taken the black vote for granted — including the Haitian vote. He also said that the efforts by Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation after the quake showed no real results.
“The Clintons' history in Haiti is symptomatic of their relationship with black people in the last 30 years,” Kenol said. “I have a problem with Clinton's Haiti policy just as much as I have one with their policies over the crime bill and welfare reform.
“The Haitian people had a rare opportunity to see Bill Clinton up close for many years and see the non-results. … There were a lot of photo ops, but five, six years later, Haitians know nothing was accomplished,” he said.
Role in Haiti
While some Haitians' dislike of Clinton is linked to former President Clinton restoring ousted Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power in 1994 and pushing out the military that led the coup d'etat, that's not the only issue. Maguire, the Haiti expert, said another important element of Haitians' antipathy is what some perceive to be former Secretary of State Clinton's “intrusive role” in Haiti's 2010 presidential elections that “subverted Haitian electoral-political process and resulted in the ascension to office of Michel Martelly.”
Martelly, a musician-turned-politician, was president of Haiti for five years. He left office Feb. 7 without an elected successor after fraud allegations derailed last year's presidential elections, forcing Haiti into a transitional government. Martelly, who failed to hold elections during his first four years as president and instead appointed friends and close associates to run cities, denied allegations at the time that he tried to rig the vote that would have chosen a new president. The vote is now rescheduled for Nov. 20.
“The unflinching public support from Hillary's Department of State and John Kerry's, too, of Martelly … also sticks in the craw of many Haitians and, I would imagine, Haitian Americans,” Maguire said.
Jean-Junior Joseph, a Port-au-Prince political blogger, agreed. The Clintons, he said, “like Haiti, but they don't know what is best for us.”
And he said Clinton didn't help her cause when she referred to Haiti as “the poorest country in our hemisphere” during the Oct. 19 presidential debate as she defended the couple's involvement in the country, especially through their charitable work.
“People on Facebook and on other social media networks were upset because they believe that if Haiti is the poorest country in the hemisphere, then the Clintons are to be blamed for part of the poverty that we are living,” Joseph said. “They came back with Aristide and then they forced Martelly in power. Look at where we are today. We are in a deep economic and political crisis because Martelly never held elections. We are paying the consequences of Martelly having been in power.”
Also hurting Clinton's support among Haitians is the release of her personal emails from her time as secretary of state. They have reinforced the perception that top aides were deeply involved in the country's internal affairs and confirmed that even some in the Clintons' network believed that Martelly was put in power by the United States.
The emails also reveal the “behind the doors” actions of the Haitian elite, in coordination with the State Department, to force the Haitian government to overturn the initial 2010 election results, and raise questions about the extent to which Clinton Foundation donors were given favorable treatment by U.S. and foundation officials after the earthquake.
Asked during the debate about emails showing that foundation donors got special access to her after the Haiti earthquake, Clinton said that “everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values.”
“The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had,” she later added, defending its work. “We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture and so much else. And we're going to keep working to help Haiti.”
On Tuesday, as Clinton tried to woo Hispanic voters on a Spanish-language show on Univision, the foundation tweeted, “President @billclinton and the #ClintonFoundation's only goal in Haiti is to help the people of #Haiti.”
Founded in 1997 as the William J. Clinton Foundation, the charitable organization's work in Haiti began in 2009 before the quake. The foundation, currently headed by Donna Shalala, now focuses on encouraging economic growth in Haiti.
Outside of the foundation, Bill Clinton has helped secure commitments of nearly $500 million that have gone to address education, healthcare, economic development, climate-smart agriculture and other challenging issues in Haiti. The efforts have put people back to work, reduced poverty, and facilitated investment across the country.
“We consider ourselves partners in Haiti's future, but our goal is simple: We want to work ourselves out of a job,” Shalala said last July. “To do that, we're actually supporting entrepreneurs and business owners and smallholder farmers who are helping to [lift] their communities around them.”
During the campaign, Trump and the GOP have tried to cast the Clintons' work in Haiti as a failure, accusing them of blurring the lines between politics, charity and business.
As U.N. Envoy for Haiti, Bill Clinton raised the country's profile on the global stage even before the earthquake left 1.5 million homeless and more than 300,000 dead and an equal number injured. After the disaster, he led several high-profile visits to check on Clinton Foundation projects and bring groups of potential investors to the country.
Away from the cameras, however, Clinton encountered frustrations and roadblocks despite professing publicly in New York that Martelly's administration was the best Haitian government that he had worked with. One Port-au-Prince business-owner was forced to give back a $415,000 Clinton Foundation loan after the government claimed part of her land under eminent domain to build a park, and she wasn't able to expand her business to provide jobs to mostly poor women.
The Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission that Clinton co-chaired alongside Haiti's prime minister also hit hurdles. Though it didn't manage money, serving as a clearing house to approve projects proposed by international aid agencies, many accused the commission of mishandling the $10.4 billion in aid that donors pledged but didn't actually give after the disaster.
But some, like Maguire, the longtime Haiti observer at George Washington University, say Haitians know they will have more of an ear in Washington if Clinton is elected.
“All things considered, the Clintons have cared deeply about Haiti and have worked with the intent of improving conditions there, even if this has not always worked out as they had hoped,” he said. “If she becomes president, this would certainly ensure that the country remains a blip on the U.S. foreign affairs radar screen.”
And Haitian Americans have continued to seek a conversation with Clinton. Last week, as she visited South Florida with President Obama, 27 Florida-based organizations and 24 other prominent Floridians wrote to her asking for her positions on issues of concern to the Haitian American community, and for a meeting regarding them.
Among the issues: whether re-designation of Temporary Protected Status for undocumented Haitians would continue and Clinton's position on the upcoming elections in Haiti.
The letter came on the heels of Hurricane Matthew, which devastated southwestern Haiti, killing at least 546 people, according to the government's official tally and wiping out 100 percent of the crops in some areas.
“Fifty-one Florida based leaders want to know what Hillary Clinton would do and will do on these issues,” said Steven Forester, a longtime activist in South Florida's Haitian community.
Herald Staff Writer Patricia Mazzei contributed to this report.
As the entire country is asking questions over Hillary Clinton's physical health, MSNBC's Morning Joe hosts, Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough have ramped up a Democratic talking point, claiming that Donald Trump is mentally unfit to serve as President.
Monday morning, Brzezinski declared that “it's time to hear from somebody in the mental health community, to look at this person who has been on television for months and give us a sense of what we have going on here.”
“And, I'm sorry, let's just not, let's stop pretending we're dealing with someone who we can completely understand,” Brzezinski added.
“And when you see someone who you think has problems, you know it. And there's not anybody at this table who doesn't think he has some sort of problem. Let's ask the questions. Let's do this at this point.” she continued, declaring that mental health questions should not remain “in the shadows.”
“Mental health is just like diabetes, or any other physical health. This is not something that I'm making a joke about. I'm very serious,” she said.
“At this point I have been asked so many times that I think it's worth asking someone in the mental health community … are these signs of something that perhaps could lead to a diagnosis?” Brzezinski concluded, adding “We've seen enough of him. It's repetitive. It's consistent.”
In previous segments, Brzezinski has declared that Trump is acting mentally unstable owing to a lack of sleep.
Over the past few weeks it is clear that Members of the Democratic-Media establishment along with GOP insiders have begun a campaign to portray Donald Trump as mentally unfit to be president, despite the fact that all signs indicate it's Hillary Clinton who is mentally incapable of taking the hot seat.
The campaign began with Barack Obama declaring Trump “unfit to serve” and since morphed into a petition launched by California Democrat Rep. Karen Bass demanding that Trump undergo a mental health evaluation.
“Donald Trump is dangerous for our country. His impulsiveness and lack of control over his own emotions are of concern. It is our patriotic duty to raise the question of his mental stability to be the commander in chief and leader of the free world,” the petition states.
“Mr. Trump appears to exhibit all the symptoms of the mental disorder Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). Mental health professionals need to come forward and urge the Republican party to insist that their nominee has an evaluation to determine his mental fitness for the job.”
Meanwhile, the controlled media has branded any questioning of Hillary's health, despite manifestly obvious signs and symptoms that something is wrong with her, as ‘conspiratorial' nonsense.
Trump has hit out repeatedly at the ‘Morning Joe' hosts over the past few weeks.
Last week, Trump tweeted that he would “tell the real story” of Scarborough and “his very insecure long-time girlfriend” Brzezinski. In another tweet, he called Brzezinski “a neurotic and not very bright mess!”
Some day, when things calm down, I'll tell the real story of @JoeNBC and his very insecure long-time girlfriend, @morningmika. Two clowns! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 22, 2016

Scarborough replied with a tweet of his own: “Neurotic and not very bright? Look in the mirror.”

MIRANSHAH, Pakistan (Reuters) - A U.S. pilotless drone fired two missiles at a house in northwest Pakistan killing five people, Pakistani intelligence agency officials said Wednesday.
Frustrated by an intensifying Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, U.S. forces have in the past month carried out seven missile strikes by pilotless drones and a commando raid on the Pakistani side of the border.
In the latest attack, a drone fired two missiles at a house near the town of Mir Ali in North Waziristan, at about midnight Tuesday (1800 GMT), two intelligence agency officials said.
The area is a known sanctuary for Pakistani Taliban and foreign militants near the Afghan border.
“We have reports of five dead including foreign militants,” said one of the officers, who declined to be identified as he is not authorized to speak to the media.
He said he had no more information about the casualties.
The U.S. strikes into Pakistan, in particular the September 3 raid by ground troops, have angered Pakistan, straining ties between the allies and leading to tension along the border which Pakistani forces have vowed to defend.
The government says the strikes are an infringement of Pakistani sovereignty.
U.S. commanders have spoken of respect for Pakistan's sovereignty but have suggested they will not stop cross-border strikes on militants.

The Just Group, including Just Jeans, Peter Alexander, Dotti
Certainly not ‘just' when it comes to workers' rights, The Just Group still does not publish their factory list on their website. This means there's no way of easily checking the conditions in factories that are making your favourite PJ's from Peter Alexander, or jeans from Just Jeans. The Group also has not joined the Bangladesh Fire & Building Safety Accord, opting instead for the weaker Alliance on Worker Safety – so it's a definite ‘naughty' from Oxfam's elves again this year for The Just Group.
Best & Less
Still not best, Best & Less has made some progress by publishing a Code of Conduct and set of policies for their suppliers, aimed at protecting worker's rights. The problem is, without also publishing the places their clothes are sewn, there's just no way to easily check if any of these good commitments are really being put into practice. The Oxfam elves are also keeping Best & Less in the bad books for never signing the Bangladesh Fire & Building Safety Accord after the terrible collapse of the Rana Plaza building in April 2013.
Topshop
Topshop wants you dress up with your very own party persona this Christmas, we just wish some of the choices were more ethical. We're inviting Topshop to our party this year by asking them to reveal exactly where they make their clothes, so we can see whether that outfit comes with more than what Australian consumers might have bargained for. Topshop does have some top ethical sourcing polices, codes and guidebooks – as well as a lot of good information about auditing on their website. Now they need to take the next step and publish their full factory list.

Credit where credit is due, Inditex (the owner of Zara) has taken the big step of publishing their list of dyeing mills used to source the fabric for their clothes. This is positive and means that workers in those factories know who else is supplying this big name in fashion, and can more easily raise issues directly with Inditex. Oxfam's elves made the tough decision of keeping them on the Naughty List this year, because we think Inditex has to do better. We want to know where their clothes are sewn together as well – and are asking Inditex to publish their full list.
Factory X, including Gorman, Dangerfield & Alannah Hill
It's hard to publish where you make your clothes when you don't have a website at all and Factory X is one company with very little public information available. However it's brands, including Gorman, Dangerfield and also Alannah Hill do all have their own websites and have taken a couple of positive steps this year. They have each published an ethical supplier code of conduct, which makes it easier for them to be held to account if factories are not up to standard. Gorman has also published a pretty clear run-down of its auditing results, showing where corrective actions have been taken. But none of these brands are transparent about exactly where they make their clothes. We love edgy fashion, but it's not cool to keep your factories under wraps. Factory X needs to step up on transparency.
PASS
Wesfarmers, including Kmart, Target and Coles
The big names in the Wesfarmers group, including Kmart, Target and Coles sell clothes all around Australia and source from all around the world. Luckily, these brands are leaders when it comes to transparency, having been first in Australia among those to publish their factory lists. Each of these companies also has clear sourcing policies and codes of conduct. When buying that T-shirt or dress from these companies, you can be assured they are not hiding the factories where their clothes are made.
H&M
One of the international leaders, H&M has long published their factory list. They've also made some moves towards paying better wages for workers across their supply chain – a welcome move. Recent reports have revealed accusations of serious issues in the H&M supply chain, and Oxfam does not take these lightly. The level of transparency by H&M, however, does allow problems like these to be uncovered much more easily – and then acted upon. So in this list we welcome their transparency as a positive step in the right direction for better conditions for workers.
GAP
Great on transparency, not as good on listening to worker's organisations: GAP has made it to the Nice List this year for recently publishing their full factory list. A big achievement. They've also got strong public polices and codes. However, GAP has chosen not to join the Bangladesh Fire & Building Safety Accord, instead being part of the weaker Alliance on Worker Safety. Both sound great, but the Accord includes unions and worker's representatives on an equal decision-making footing with brands. So, well done on transparency GAP – but still some work to do!
Specialty Fashion Group, including Katies, Rivers, Millers/Autograph, Crossroads and City Chic
Speciality Fashion Group is a 2016 success story: taking the bold decision to publish their factory list in April this year. At the time, Group CEO Gary Perlstein told Oxfam he was proud to make their suppliers and sourcing policies visible, in order to help customers to make more informed purchasing decisions. Well done Specialty Fashion Group!
Big W, owned by Woolworths
Big W is another 2016 publisher – revealing their factory list also in early 2016. The company is committed to regularly updating the list and also publishes lots of useful information on their souring policies and the way in which they audit their factories.
Cotton On Group, including Cotton On, Cotton On Kids, Cotton On Body, Rubi, Typo, Supre and Factorie
Cotton On cottoned on to transparency in August 2016, joining the growing numbers of Australian companies publishing their factory lists. They also publish strong codes of conduct, sourcing policies and some auditing details, as well as being a party to positive initiatives like the Bangladesh Fire & Building Safety Accord.
Pacific Brands: Rio, Bonds, Explorer, Sheridan, Berlei, Holeproof & Jockey
‘Show your glow' is Bonds' catch-cry for the season and it sure will be bright for workers because they've published their factories just in time to make our Nice List! Not only that, Pacific Brands new parent company, US brand Hanes, has also added to the list of factories they publish. Together both companies are now publishing 95% of their global supply chain. That's getting into the spirit of giving! Pacific Brands can also be applauded for being a part of the Ethical Trading Initiative and having strong policies and codes.
Jeanswest
Earlier this month Jeanswest published 80% of their factory list – that's a big move going from zero to (almost) hero! We look forward to celebrating when that final 20% is brought out of the dark. Jeanswest also makes some clothes in Australia, and they get an extra candy cane from Oxfam's elves for ensuring their Aussie fashion line is accredited with Ethical Clothing Australia.
Forever New
Forever New are asking customers to be ‘Forever Festive' this Christmas and the Oxfam elves are ready to party – here's why: the company has just gone from publishing only 40% of their factory list to publishing 70%. There's still a long way to go, but this is one big improvement just in time to jump across from Naughty to Nice this Christmas. They've also got a strong policy and code of conduct for all to see and are members of the Bangladesh Accord.
The PAS Group, including Designworks, Review
Everyone loves a good dress and these brands makes some lovely ones – and now we're happy to say you can feel a little better about buying them for your next big event! In an exciting move, the PAS Group has just published 70% of their international supply chain. We can't wait for them to publish the rest! On top of this, one of their brands, Designworks, is a signatory to the Bangladesh Accord, and another is accredited by Ethical Clothing Australia…so keep up the good work PAS!
Uniqlo
UPDATE: This year major clothing companies ASOS and Uniqlo listened to mounting public pressure and joined hundreds of companies who have published their factory lists.

A sex symbol is a famous person or fictional character widely regarded to be very sexually attractive.[2]
History
The term sex symbol was first used in the mid-1950s in relation to the popularity of certain film stars and pin-up models, including Marilyn Monroe, Brigitte Bardot, and Raquel Welch.[3] This concept was a reflection of the post-World War II increase of sexual and economic emancipation of women.[2]
In the 20th century, sex symbols could be male as well as female: actors such as the romantic Sessue Hayakawa and the athletic Douglas Fairbanks were popular in the 1910s and 1920s. Archetypal screen lover Rudolph Valentino's death in 1926 caused mass hysteria among his female fans.[4][5] In Hollywood, many film stars were seen as sex symbols, such as Errol Flynn, Gary Cooper, and Clark Gable. The "bad boy" image of the 1950s was epitomized by sex symbols such as James Dean and Marlon Brando.[6]
In his Elvis Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him as "the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America," in the 1950s and 1960s, through his overtly suggestive dance moves.
Fictional sex symbols
With regard to fiction, Rotten Tomatoes states that the 1930s cartoon character Betty Boop is "the first and most famous sex symbol on animated screen".[8] Jessica Rabbit (voiced by Kathleen Turner) from the 1988 live-action/animation crossover film Who Framed Roger Rabbit has been described as a sex symbol as well.[9]. Toot Braunstein (voiced by Tara Strong) from the adult animated sitcom Drawn Together is also considered as a sex symbol.[10]
Video games have had a few characters that are considered sex symbols; one example would be Lara Croft,[11][12][13] who has had several appearances in mainstream media. Other notable sex symbols include Rayne, the first video game character that appeared in Playboy, in its October 2004 US issue's article, "Gaming Grows Up";[14] and Nina Williams, voted "Hottest" Female Fighting Character in Guinness World Records, Gamers Edition 2008.[15]

A nurse invited a teenage colleague to 'fill in' the gap while he could not sleep with his pregnant wife, a disciplinary heard.
Noah Kantoh, 35, made the sexually motivated comment to the 17-year-old cleaner while working with her at the Medway Maritime Hospital in Gillingham, Kent.
He had been accused of a string of charges against her, including trying to kiss her, groping her breasts and accusing her of spurning his advances because he was black.
But a Nursing and Midwifery Council panel found there was insufficient evidence to support the bulk of the charges against him.
However, the lone remark Mr Kantoh was found to have made - "You can fill in the three-month gap as I can't sleep with my wife" - amounted to misconduct and meant that his fitness to practise was impaired.
Imposing a three-year caution order, panel chair Laurence Peterken said: "The panel accepts this was an isolated incident involving a colleague and patient safety was not compromised.
"The panel accepts that your conduct, albeit serious, is on the lower end of the spectrum of sexually motivated conduct.
"Although you have shown insight, you have not shown full insight and there was no admission to any of the facts proved."
He added that in directing the caution, he wanted the panel to make clear that Kantoh's behaviour was "unacceptable and must not be repeated again".
A further charge relating to a clinical error while dispensing medication was also found proved, but the panel ruled it did not amount to misconduct.
The cleaner, now in her early 20s, said she had made it clear to Kantoh that she was not interested and that his comments, made between October 2007 and October 2008, "disgusted" her.
But defence witness Peterkin Ofori, who worked with the pair at the hospital, said they knew one another well and were on "friendly" terms.
He said the girl had told him she had been 'bullied' into reporting Kantoh, but would not confirm by whom.
"I called her straight away to find out had happened. I was shocked," he explained.
"She then told me she was bullied to make the allegation. I said by who but she would not say. She did not want to talk about it.'
Mr Ofori also confessed to having an affair with the girl in June 2008 and said he had heard rumours that there had been other relationships as well.
The panel also found that while working at the Fountains Nursing Home in Manchester Kantoh had dispensed medication from residents' blister packs and placed them into pots on the trolley, contrary to the home's policy on March 24, 2010.

The momentum crowd has been running up gold and silver based on superficial beliefs about QE3. This group of investors is not known for deep study or paying heed to rigorous analysis. Now a major player in the metals business is sending a signal loud and clear that gold and silver prices are not about to skyrocket.
Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. FCX, -0.60% is spending $9 billion not to buy another metal company, but to diversify into energy.
Proven reserves of Freeport include 33.9 million ounces of gold, 330.3 million ounces of silver, 119.7 billion pounds of copper, 3.42 billion pounds of molybdenum, and 0.86 billion pounds of cobalt. It stands to reason that if Freeport believed that QE will cause gold and silver prices to skyrocket, it would have made acquisitions of gold and silver miners. Instead, Freeport is buying Plains Exploration & Production US:PXP for about $6.9 billion and McMoRan Exploration for about $2.1 billion.
It is worth examining market caps of some precious-metal miners to see what Freeport could have bought in the precious metals space for nine billion dollars. Here are a few examples:
Pan American Silver with a market cap of $2.75 billion.
Coeur d'Alene with a market cap of 1.99 billion.
Hecla Mining with a market cap of $1.60 billion.
Kinross Gold with a market cap of $10.84 billion.
Eldorado Gold with a market cap of $9.52 billion.
In the meantime, the SPDR Gold Trust ETF GLD, +0.17% and the iShares Silver Trust ETF SLV, +0.27% fell below technical supports. Market Vectors ETF Trust Market Vectors Gold Miners EFT GDX, -0.18% and Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF GDXJ, +0.81% also lost ground.
It did not help that Goldman Sachs downgraded its projection for gold prices. Goldman's new target for gold over the next 12 months is $1800. Interestingly, Goldman forecasted gold price of $1750 for 2014.
In my opinion, based on their actions, Freeport, a company with a long history in the metals business, does not believe that gold and silver prices will skyrocket because of QE3, and neither should you.
Every astute investor should understand the true nature of QE3, which isn't the same as the popular belief. History shows many examples of astute investors making a killing when they were able to carefully study a phenomenon and conclude that the popular beliefs were wrong.
The subject is of such utmost importance to investors that we are making available to the readers of this article an online seminar titled 'Gold and Silver Post QE3' at no charge.
About
Tits or GTFO is an expression used on male-centric BBS and imageboard sites, typically in response to a seductive image posted by anonymous users who claim to be girls. GTFO is an internet acronym for the phrase "Get the Fuck Out," which is also widely used in chat rooms, forums, 4chan, etc.
Origin
The origin of the phrase "Tits or GTFO" can be traced back to 4chan circa 2006. (see 4chanarchive.org) It first came about as a response to a girl posting a picture of herself, which could be followed by any kind of question, statement or otherwise. For more information on its origin, please read up on There are No Girls on the Internet.
Example in Dialogue
Self-claimed Girl: "Do I look pretty?"
Poster: "Tits or GTFO!"
Use
Since its creation, "Tits or GTFO" has evolved and has now become usable in any situation, including those in which the speaker wishes to dismiss the people he or she is arguing with, or simply has grown tired of the conversation. For instance, someone may say, "And if you don't like it, Tits or GTFO." There are some places such as a couple of IRC channels and some chat rooms that use this phrase as a greeting.
IRC user #1 has joined the chat room. IRC user #1: Hey guys!
IRC user #2: Tits or GTFO.
Tits or GTFO has also inspired many images which may or not be related to the "Tits" part.

After an 18-year absence, Loyola University Maryland is back in the NCAA Tournament. The Greyhounds secured their first Big Dance berth since 1994 with a 48-44 win over Fairfield in the MAAC championship game in Springfield, Mass.
After trailing 30-26 at halftime, the Greyhounds scored the first nine points of the second half and never trailed again. Fairfield only scored 14 points in the second 20 minutes as the game degenerated into a scrappy, sloppy affair.The Greyhounds had a 47-44 lead with three minutes to play, but the only field goal the rest of the game was a Desmond Wade three-pointer that made the score 47-44. The Stags had two chances to tie the game, but three-point attempts by Ryan Olander and Rakim Sanders missed. Shane Walker hit the front end of a 1-and-1 with 2.8 seconds to provide the final margin.
Erik Etherly finished the game with 10 points to lead Loyola in scoring. Fairfield was led by Sanders and Olander, who scored 12 and 11 points, respectively. Maurice Barrow added 10 points in a losing effort for the Stags.
This week a viral photo of an emaciated female polar bear on a melting shard of ice took the online world by storm. The disturbing image, captured in the Svalbard archipelago between Norway and the North Pole by nature guide and photographer Kerstin Langenberger, sparked yet more worries that polar bears face an uncertain future in a world where climate change is melting Arctic ice at an increasing pace. Polar bears depend almost entirely on sea ice for their habitat and hunting, so its disappearance spells trouble for the species.
Langenberger and I were guests on radio station KCRW's “To The Point” program to discuss the image and the plight of the world's polar bears:

In 2010, Eike Batista announced that he would soon become the world's richest man, and it didn't seem particularly hyberbolic. Brazil's economy was thriving, and investors around the world were lining up to invest in his commodities empire, which consisted of six highly successful public Brazilian companies, including OGX, the country's second largest oil company, and MMX, one of its largest miners. By 2012, his wealth stood at some $30 billion, making him the seventh-richest man in the world.
And then the last 18 months happened.
Amidst Brazil's economic slowdown, Batista's net worth hasn't merely tumbled—it's evaporated. Batista isn't vying for the richest man any longer, or for a place among the world's top 100, or even among its billionaires. According to estimates by Forbes, his worth has now dropped to an estimated $900 million, a 97% drop.
Most of that is due to the struggles of OGX, the biggest of Batista's companies. In July the company announced its plans to shutter two of its most productive wells. Last week, a run of more bad news caused the stock to lose 63% of its market value, including a whopping 40% drop on Friday alone; it enjoyed a rebound today, but that was largely due to quirks of the Brazilian stock market. And its financial woes are threatening its very existence. This past June, OGX reported nearly $5 billion in debt and a net loss of over $2 billion during the second quarter. If the company defaults on its heaping pile of debt, it would mark the largest such default in Latin American history, according to Forbes.
But Batista's financial woes extend well beyond OGX. Much of his estimated remaining $900 million lies in shares of his other publicly traded companies, none of which has managed to turn a profit. Batista, however, pledged his personal wealth to back the plethora of loans made to each, and is now himself scrambling to sell assets in order to pay creditors. Back in March, he relinquished control of his energy company, MPX, and just last month he agreed to sell the Chilean portion of his mining company, MMX, to Inversiones Cooper Mining, and resigned as chairman of his logistics company, LLX, which was bought by EIG Global Energy Partners LLC.
Filing for bankruptcy could buy Batista time to sell off some assets, unload shares of his companies, and settle debts. But the mogul appears intent on fixing his empire without declaring bankruptcy. This past July, Batista declared that he would honor every penny of the billions in outstanding debt. Presently, it looks like the only way to do that is to unwind the commodities empire that once looked unassailable.
Over the last nine years Frank Lowy's Westfield Group paid an average of 8% tax, with its Retail Trust paying 0%. Sonia Nair and Mark Chapman from Taxpayers Australia report.
THE PREVAILING SENTIMENT from the recent Federal Budget is that the “heavy lifting” that Treasurer Joe Hockey said every Australian must do was reserved for society's most vulnerable — a claim only bolstered by a recently released report by union United Voice, which exposes the low tax rates paid by retail giant Westfield.
Conducted by senior lecturer in accounting and tax at the University of Technology Sydney, Roman Lanis, the report said the “effective corporate tax rate” that Westfield paid in the nine years leading up to December 2013 was 8% for the Westfield Group – significantly less than the current 30% company tax rate – and 0% for the Westfield Retail Trust.
United Voice said both figures fall well below the 22% estimated tax rate for the top 200 sharemarket-listed companies over the past decade — an anomaly seeing Westfield is
'... Australia's most profitable real estate corporation and the world's largest shopping centre owner.'
The report says Westfield is a superlative tax avoider:
'Westfield also stands out as the real estate company which has avoided the lion's share of tax in the nine years to 31 December 2013, representing 34% of the total tax minimisation activities of the real estate sector.'
Acting national secretary of United Voice, David O'Byrne, said the research reveals that Westfield is not doing its fair share of “heavy lifting on tax”.
And the worst part, according to O'Byrne, the tax minimisation strategies are perfectly lawful:
"Tax avoidance may not be illegal, but we believe it is immoral and never more than today when low-income earners are facing a budget of across-the-board cutbacks. While some corporations are paying their tax, there are others who simply look to exploit any loophole they can.”
O'Byrne highlighted how if Westfield had paid tax at the correct statutory rate of 30%, the Tax Office would be in for additional annual tax revenues of $541 million – comprising $370 million on average pre-tax profits of $1.7 billion for the Westfield Group and $171 million on average pre-tax profits of $574 million for the Westfield Retail Trust.
Taxpayers Australia's head of tax, Mark Chapman (the co-author of this piece), said the findings of United Voice's report are particularly galling given the recent measures proposed by the Federal Budget.
The Treasurer was keen to stress that we all have to do the heavy lifting, but Westfield's on-going behaviour is further proof that many large corporates simply don't believe they have to play by the same rules as the rest of us. Worst of all, the Government and the tax authorities are complicit in this by failing to act to prevent this kind of blatant abuse.
United Voice is the union that represents cleaners at Westfield's 38 shopping centres and is currently locked in a dispute with the conglomerate over the pay conditions of its cleaners.
Its report has since attracted the ire of Westfield, with spokesman Mark Ryan reportedly describing it as:
“... flawed and so obviously written to grab cheap media attention."
Well-documented instances of Westfield's tax minimisation strategies
But it would be foolhardy to view United Voice's latest report in isolation. Westfield has a long, chequered history when it comes to tax minimisation schemes — and not one that is confined to Australia either.
United Voice's latest report belongs to a series of reports commissioned to explore Westfield's global tax avoidance. Released in April 2014, Olympic Tax Dodging: Westfield's Corporate Structure for Tax Avoidance in the UK uncovered how Westfield's corporate structure in the UK includes a web of undisclosed subsidiaries registered in Jersey – a known tax haven.
According to the report:
'If Westfield had paid the UK corporate tax rate of 24%, it would have generated an additional £22.4 million ($40.9 million) in tax revenue in 2012 alone. The use of tax havens allows the company to shift up to 75% of their profits out of the UK.'
Westfield also employs its tax minimisation strategies in the United States. The United Voice report Westfield's Two Faces: Community Consequences of Tax Avoidance published late last year found that Westfield avoided paying an estimated $116.4 million in U.S. property taxes in 2012 alone.
Additionally, a report published by the ReFund California Coalition in August 2013, entitled Consequences of Corporate Property Tax Avoidance, revealed that in California – where Westfield is the largest retail landlord – the retail group avoided an estimated $41 million per annum in local property taxes across the state.
The report said:
'Such additional revenues could be spent to improve public education, bolster police and fire services and generally raise the quality of public services across the state of California.'
Westfield has also attracted criticism over the disclosure and transparency of its operations, after it elected to no longer report on property values by individual property on its US holdings and to no longer disclose all of its subsidiaries.
United Voice isn't the only one either to shed light on Westfield's financial secrecy.
A separate report conducted by the Uniting Church last year said Westfield's highly complex corporate structure includes more than 50 entities registered in tax havens such as Jersey but also Luxembourg and Singapore.
Its co-founder, Australian businessman Frank Lowy, has himself attracted the scrutiny of American and Australian tax authorities over his alleged use of tax shelters in Liechtenstein and Bermuda.
Revelations of Westfield's tax minimisation strategies belong to a larger trend of huge multinationals shifting their profits elsewhere.
published late last year found that Westfield avoided paying an estimated $116.4 million in U.S. property taxes in 2012 alone.
Earlier this year, U.S. tech giant Apple was accused of shifting $8.9 billion in untaxed profits from its Australian operations to Ireland over the past decade, while Google paid just $466,802 in tax despite profits almost doubling to $46.5 million.
Mark Chapman has called for an end to government hypocrisy around tax evasion:
The government and their friends in the media feed us a steady drip of stories on a daily basis of bludgers rorting the system. Whether it's the unemployed, the disabled, migrants or students, there's always a government minister or a backbencher or a tame journalist ready with an anecdote about how we're a nation of leaners. And right in front of us, on a daily basis, companies like Westfield are ripping off taxpayers to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. How many GP visits would that pay for? How many university places? How many training schemes for the unemployed? The Treasurer berates the opposition for failing to spell out what alternatives they have to fix his so-called “budget emergency”. Well, here's one, Joe: fix the tax system, close the loopholes and make sure that ALL taxpayers pay the tax they're supposed to pay, at the time they're supposed to pay it and in the place they're supposed to pay it. Until that happens, all the talk of the “end of the age of entitlement” is just so much hot air.

Researchers may have uncovered a rare genetic mutation that can give them insight into prolonging human life and raises hopes for fighting aging and preventing age-related disorders ranging from heart disease to dementia, according to The Guardian.
Scientists first spotted the mutation in an Amish community in rural Indiana that are known for having strong metabolic health, far lower rates of diabetes, and lived around a decade longer than others in the community.
The study examined 177 members of the Old Order Amish in the town of Berne, IN and identified 43 that inherited one normal and one mutated version of a gene called Serpine 1.
Those that had the mutated version of the gene typically lived to 85 years old, a full 10 years more than those that did not carry the mutated form.
“This is a rare genetic mutation that appears to protect against biological aging in humans,” said Douglas Vaughan, a professor of medicine who led the research at Northwestern University in Chicago.
The Serpine1 gene is essential for the body since it provides instructions on making a protein called PAI-1 which curbs a process that destroys any clots that may buildup in blood vessels, while also having a part in senescence, where cells go into a state of suspended animation and steadily build up in the body's tissues.
Senescence is also said to be a strong power in the aging process.
Studies using animals show that reducing levels of PAI-1 can help protect them from aging and age-related diseases, and even prolong life in some cases.
The same effect was previously unobserved in humans but the Amish group in Indiana are the only known community that carries the mutation that naturally suppresses levels of PAI-1 in the blood.
The researchers wrote in the journal Science Advances to describe how those with the single mutated gene had 50% lower levels of PAI-1 in their blood.
Scientists also examined the participants for biological markers associating with aging, called telomeres, which are tiny caps that are at the ends of chromosomes and which get shorter with age.
Carriers of the mutated gene had longer telomeres than others, suggesting that they had potentially aged slower than the others.
Other tests also found a range of health benefits for those with the mutation, including increased metabolic health, lower levels of diabetes, and a longer lifespan.
The scientists also found that some in the same community had two mutated copies of the gene and no detectable PAI-1, but that often led to the development of a bleeding disorder.
The oldest affected person is still only 30 years old so researchers can not tell what the impact of a double mutation on a full lifespan.
“It seems that there's a sweet spot. You don't want too much PAI-1, and you don't want zero,” said Vaughan.
Researchers are already working on drugs that can slightly reduce blood levels of PAI-1, including the diabetes drug, metformin, but scientists at Tohoku University in Japan also recently started trials for a new drug that directly targets PAI-1.
If the drug is successful, it could be used to delay the onset of certain age-related diseases and help some patients that have conditions which cause them to age prematurely.
“We are very optimistic about its potential role not just in slowing aging but in reducing age-related morbidities,” Vaughan said.

Bill Clinton's speech was excellent for all the reasons I thought Julián Castro's speech the previous evening was weak. In confusing times, good leaders can help the public understand our politics, and as Obama himself has admitted, he has not always excelled at this over the last few years. But it's long been Bill Clinton's special gift. Indeed, Clinton's frustration with his party's inability to explain what's going on politically in this country helped encourage him to write his recent book, “Back To Work.” (In it, he tells a story about being rebuffed when he tried to give the Democratic National Committee some advice on talking points for the 2010 election.) This was not so much a speech about Obama, but one about the choice voters face and the framework they should use in making it.
[#image: /photos/5909543f6552fa0be682ca38]
Clinton started with a favorite subject of his: the coöperation that he sees among parties trying to solve problems around the world through his work at the Clinton Global Initiative. However, here in the U.S., despite President Obama's best efforts, an unreasonable and ideological political faction has made coöperation impossible. From there he pivoted to recent history, making a seemingly dispassionate case for why no President, even Clinton himself, could ever have repaired in four years all the damage Obama found when he arrived in the White House in 2009. But despite that, Obama's record, told with excruciating but powerfully persuasive detail, has been far better than is popularly understood. Now he just needs his contract renewed to finish the job. Clinton made it all sound so simple.
This was the anti-Michelle speech. While she naturally gave personal testimony about Barack Obama's character and urged voters to support him on that basis, in the story Clinton told Obama was an ephemeral figure. There were few personal details or anecdotes about the President because Clinton isn't particularly close to Obama. It was a speech about facts and three and a half years of decisions made and outcomes achieved. By the end of it, the only logical conclusion, Clinton argued, is that Obama would do a better job than the alternative.
In a sense, Clinton's reluctance to embrace Obama personally, and his own fraught history with the President, which I explored in a piece for The New Yorker this week, makes him the ideal spokesman to appeal to those skeptical former Obama voters that his campaign is trying to win back. In an interview with Brian Williams earlier in the day, Clinton said of Obama, “We haven't been close friends a long time or anything like that, but he knows that I support him.” I found it an amazingly honest statement considering that politicians often go out of their way to exaggerate their fondness for one another.
And it was exactly their lack of personal chemistry and failure to become “close friends” that gave Clinton's speech its lift. A subtext of the address was that, just like Bill Clinton, wavering voters need not love Obama to understand that he's a better choice than Romney. When the two Presidents came together and hugged after the speech was (finally) over, the distance between them made their embrace all the more powerful.

The Ball That Goalkeeper Frank Moss Scored Against Everton
On 16 March 1935 league leaders Arsenal travelled to Goodison Park, Everton for a First Division game. For one man it was to be a bitter sweet afternoon as, while he scored an unexpected goal, his football playing career was essentially ended on that day.
With the game scoreless, Frank Moss dislocated his shoulder after half an hour so badly at that he had to be replaced by Eddie Hapgood in goal. He left the field of play and received treatment in the dressing room from Tom Whittaker. To most people's surprise Moss came onto the pitch at the start of the second half wearing a red shirt. At that time there were no substitutes allowed in English football, not even for severely injured players. He took up his place on the left wing with his injured arm strapped to his side, ensuring that the title chasing Gunners continued the game with a full complement of players.
This was not the first time he had been injured and replaced by Hapgood in goal while he was moved to roam the left touchline. In the closing stages against Sheffield United in December 1933 he dislocated some fingers and while on the wing almost scored at Bramall Lane. But this time he surpassed expectations and scored in the 2-0 win over Everton.
Drake scored the first with a long range pile-driver past Ted Sagar in the first half, just six minutes after Moss had left the field. In the second half, Arsenal's re-arranged defence held firm with Hapgood making a number of exceptional saves, and then Moss, who showed a surprising fleetness of foot, latched onto a pass from Drake and buried the ball into the Everton net in the 70th minute.
The reports said that even the Toffee fans applauded his goal, as he was mobbed by his excited teammates. Shortly after the goal he left the field in agony as the injury flared up again. He was taken to hospital after the game and had his shoulder reset.
Moss had up to that point in the season been an ever present in goal, but this injury, which turned out to be a double dislocation, meant his place for the remainder of the title winning season was taken by Alex Wilson.
The ball was presented to him once it had been signed by all the players who took part in the game as a memento for his rare achievement.
Moss had an operation on his shoulder and damaged arm muscle in August 1935 in a Newcastle hospital. After playing four games in the reserves, he returned to the first team on 28 December 1935 when he appeared in a classic game that Sunderland just shaded 5-4 at Roker Park. His shoulder lasted only another seven games, until 8 February 1936, when, against Blackburn, it was dislocated again requiring remedial resetting in a Blackburn infirmary, and the specialist he visited in Newcastle advised resting for the rest of the season. However as it transpired he was not to play again at that level.
This second dislocation had brought his goalkeeping career to an end, and Alex Wilson kept goal in the 1936 FA Cup final. George Allison obviously believed that Moss could still play a part for Arsenal as he was tried on the wing in three reserve team friendlies during the first half of the 1936‑37 season. Despite scoring in the first two games it was decided that it wouldn't make it and he had to retire from playing.
After almost the entire 1936-37 season in the Highbury wings being mentored for a leader's role he left Arsenal when he was appointed manager of Heart of Midlothian on 1 March 1937. Moss had retired from playing at the premature age of 27.
Frank remains the only Arsenal goalkeeper to score a goal during normal time in a first team game but one other goalkeeper has scored a goal for the club. In October 2003 Arsenal were held to a 1-1 draw by Rotherham United in the League Cup at Highbury. The penalty shoot seemed like it was never going to end, with the teams taking 22 spot kicks in total. Number 19 was taken, and converted, by Graham Stack who then took his place in goal and saved the following penalty, turning the shoot-out on its head resulting in an Arsenal win.

The ownership of the ball has changed hands several times since it was given to Frank. Most recently, it was sold at auction in London in May 2015 for £4,500.

Hello, I think current events show how important it is to make this case publicly known. On Dec 6th 2005 PHP got a partial protection against HTTP response splitting. A security mitigation == Security Patch == important The commit is here: http://svn.php.net/viewvc/php/php-src/trunk/main/SAPI.c?r1=200124&r2=202220 569 /* new line safety check */ 570 { 571 char *s = header_line, *e = header_line + header_line_len, *p; 572 while (s < e && (p = memchr(s, '
', (e - s)))) { 573 if (*(p + 1) == ' ' || *(p + 1) == '\t') { 574 s = p + 1; 575 continue; 576 } 577 efree(header_line); 578 sapi_module.sapi_error(E_WARNING, "Header may not contain more than a single header, new line detected."); 579 return FAILURE; 580 } 581 } As you can see the code checks for
and only allows it if it followed by whitespace to protect against header injections. Now fast forward to 2011/2012 the PHP developers get a security bug report that this protection is not sufficient, because browsers are too allowing. https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=60227 You can see that this bug is not marked as some kind of security bug, although it is reported as security bug. This results in the following code being changed in PHP see (http://svn.php.net/viewvc/php/php-src/branches/PHP_5_3/main/SAPI.c?r1=321634&r2=322263): 592 /* new line safety check */ 593 char *s = header_line, *e = header_line + header_line_len, *p; 594 while (s < e && ((p = memchr(s, '
', (e - s))) || (p = memchr(s, '\r', (e - s))))) { 595 if (*(p + 1) == ' ' || *(p + 1) == '\t') { 596 s = p + 1; 597 continue; Keep in mind this is a security fix/improvement. So one would expect this to get reviewed. But it is obviously not reviewed, because any \r before the last
won't be checked. So bypassing this is easy as \rSet-Cookie: XXX=YYY; \r
blah So I point this obvious flaw out several times, yesterday on the internals mailinglist in public infront of everyone. But instead of someone from the security team taking action just some guy gets going and patching it. The commit is here: http://svn.php.net/viewvc/php/php-src/trunk/main/SAPI.c?r1=321634&r2=323033 Best thing about this commit is the commit message: - Hopefully correct fix for bug #60227. #No commit for 5.4 for now From the commit message it seems obvious that the guy commiting it is not really sure that he fixed anything. Not a good way to handle a security fix/improvement. But it gets better: without review this code is now merged from Trunk into PHP 5.3 So the new code looks like this: 714 char *s = header_line; 715 while (s = strpbrk(s, "
\r")) { 716 if (s[1] == ' ' || s[1] == '\t') { 717 /* RFC 2616 allows new lines if followed by SP or HT */ 718 s++; 719 continue; 720 } well lets look a bit further: 727 sapi_header.header = header_line; 728 sapi_header.header_len = header_line_len; Now the educated reader might think: Wait a second! There is a header_line_len? So maybe that header_line can contain NUL bytes. Wait… that security check is using a string function that will stop at a NUL byte. And then maybe the person reading the code will realize: wait! they just killed the whole protection, because now a single NUL byte infront of the \r
will bypass it. Luckily it is not affecting everyone, because at least the Apache SAPI will stop sending the header at the NUL byte, too. However everybody running CGI/FastCGI will loose the protection with this. And that my dear readers is exactly what would happen to the code of Suhosin if it gets merged into PHP. It would be patched by people that do not know exactly what they are doing. And it would be broken. And if I would not sit on every single commit to PHP this would happen, because obviously inside PHP no one cares about reviewing security patches. And with Suhosin outside of PHP, there is a secondary protection layer around PHP that would have catched this problem: also known as defense in depth. Regards, Stefan
Two employees of a dog-walking service took a few dogs to Snyder's Flats on Wednesday – and left with one more than they had when they arrived.
Kayla Farrell and Kelli Boogemans work for Complete K9.
When they arrived at the popular Waterloo spot for walking dogs, they found one particular dog wandering around, all alone.
With no owner in sight and the Jack Russell cross-breed continually returning to the parking lot, they surmised that it had likely been left there intentionally.
“How somebody could do that to somebody so sweet, it's truly heartbreaking,” Farrell said Thursday.
The dog had no collar, microchip or other identifying information. Boogemans describes it as being “scared and fragile and confused.”
She says it's not the first time she's found an animal that appeared to have been left behind at Snyder's Flats.
“Think of dropping your grandparents off in an unknown location. That's basically what people do (with dogs),” she said.
Farrell and Boogemans ended up taking the dog to the Kitchener-Waterloo Humane Society, which is treating it as a stray animal because they have no proof it was abandoned.
Abandoning an animal is considered a crime in Canada.
Humane Society officials say they regularly get calls from people looking to get rid of their no-longer-wanted pets.
They currently have a waiting list for that service. Video cameras outside their Kitchener headquarters occasionally capture footage of people leaving animals at the building and driving away.

SA budget: What happens if the Government's bank levy is opposed in Parliament?
Updated
The South Australian Government's controversial bank tax is contained in a piece of draft legislation known as the Budget Measures Bill.
If successful, it means major banks operating in SA will have to pay a quarterly levy of 0.015 per cent on bonds and deposits over $250,000 — excluding mortgages and ordinary household deposits.
With the support of two independent members of cabinet, Labor has the numbers to get the bill through the House of Assembly.
But it's a different story in the Legislative Council, where the Government does not have the numbers.
If the Liberals, two Australian Conservative MLCs and Nick Xenophon Team representatives stick to their guns and vote against it, the bill will not pass.
What's the catch?
The Budget Measures Bill also contains other important taxation changes.
Some, like a levy on foreign real estate investors, deliver Treasury more money.
Others, like payroll tax relief and stamp duty relief for apartment buyers, are designed to hand money back.
Because the bill is a "money bill", the Legislative Council cannot amend it as it does with many others.
Instead, it can only make suggested changes — written into the bill with erased type — for the House of Assembly to consider.
What if the Government sticks to its guns?
Here's where things get really interesting. If the Government gets a recommendation from the Legislative Council to defeat the bank tax, it can either:
Fall on its sword and remove the bank levy, wearing a $370-million hit to the budget bottom line
Reintroduce the bill as is, in the hope of a change of heart in the Upper House
Replace the bank levy with another tax or revenue measure that may or may not be blocked
Shelve the Budget Measures Bill. This will still cost the budget hundreds of millions of dollars, but means other measures like payroll tax and stamp duty relief will not go through.
For the moment, however, the Government has suggested it will stick to its guns and introduce the Budget Measures Bill as it is.
Has this happened before?
Yes, but not often. Unlike the Federal Parliament, the major parties in SA have long had a mutual understanding of sorts that governments should be able to pass their budgets in their entirety.
This convention was broken in 2014 when the Liberals, Family First and John Darley joined forces to block the Labor Government's CBD parking levy.
In that instance, the Government ended up excising the proposed parking tax from the budget and also cancelled associated spending on new park'n'ride facilities.
In this case, the Government has suggested the bank levy is funding the budget's $200 million jobs package.
In reality, however, the two budget measures are not directly tied.
Is there any other way out of this stalemate?
There's always the thermonuclear option: an early election.
For this to occur, the Government would need to declare the Budget Measures Bill a "bill of special importance".
If the Legislative Council votes down or ignores such a bill, the Government has the right to ask the Governor to dissolve the House of Assembly and issue writs for an election.
It's worth noting this is extremely unlikely.
South Australians are already due to go to the polls in March and it would be a brave Government that sought an early election to win a mandate for a new tax.
Also, as Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and British Prime Minister Theresa May have learnt, voters in recent times have not been particularly keen to reward governments seeking an early poll.

After scamming Americans, Republicans are now handing billions in tax cuts to Wells Fargo. Their CEO has admitted he won't use the bonus money to hire anyone, even after just authorizing layoffs.
Wells Fargo, a company that earns billions of dollars, is about to get billions more thanks to the new Republican tax bill. And the bank's CEO has just bluntly explained that enormous handout won't be used to help average workers.
The admission flies in the face of Republican leaders like Speaker Paul Ryan, who, like Donald Trump, adheres to the conservative belief that tax cuts for mega-corporations lead to benefits that trickle down to average Americans.
It is an assertion that wasn't true when Ronald Reagan said it or when George W. Bush said it. It has never been true.
Over the last few years, Well Fargo has been at the heart of a massive scandal where they were caught signing up customers for fake bank and credit card accounts that led to the resignation of its CEO. Republicans are rewarding the company by cutting its tax rate.
CNN reports that Wells Fargo will receive an 18 percent boost to its earnings from the GOP's bill. That's an increase of possibly $5 billion, based on the $21.93 billion Wells Fargo profited in 2016.
The current CEO, Tim Sloan, said that money will go to the company's investors, and not to expenditures like new hiring.
In a presentation to investors, Sloan was asked what the company plans to do with the GOP-engineered windfall. He answered, “Is it our goal to increase return to our shareholders and do we have an excess amount of capital? The answer to both is, yes. So our expectation should be that we will continue to increase our dividend and our share buybacks next year and the year after that and the year after that.”
That means the wealthiest people who own part of Wells Fargo, including Sloan, will get the spoils.
Meanwhile, Wells Fargo is laying off employees in Charlotte, North Carolina, and at a call center in Pennsylvania.
Despite being handed out billions by the Republican Party, their priorities are clearly to reward those who are already well-off — who even profited from the scandal — and not in hiring people in North Carolina and Pennsylvania.
Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by 0.72 percent in Pennsylvania and 3.66 percent in North Carolina, and this is how the states and their workers are being treated in response.
The Republican tax bill is another in a long line of tax scams, where the only thing that trickles down on to average Americans is more empty promises and deception.
The Château du Clos Lucé (or simply Clos Lucé) is a large château in the city of Amboise, France. The place is famous for being the official residence of Leonardo da Vinci between 1516 and 1519, when Leonardo died.
Clos Lucé is located at 500 metres from the royal Château d'Amboise, to which it is connected by an underground passageway. Built by Hugues d'Amboise in the middle of the fifteenth century, it was acquired in 1490 by Charles VIII of France for his wife, Anne de Bretagne. Later, it was used by Francis I, as well as his sister Marguerite de Navarre, who began writing her book entitled L'Heptaméron while living there.
In 1516, King Francis I of France invited Leonardo da Vinci to Amboise and provided him with the Clos Lucé, then called Château de Cloux, as a place to stay and work.[1] Leonardo, a famous painter and inventor, arrived with three of his paintings, namely the Mona Lisa, Sainte Anne, and Saint Jean Baptiste. Leonardo lived at the Clos Lucé for the last three years of his life, and died there on 2 May 1519.
Today, the Clos Lucé is a Leonardo da Vinci museum that reflects the prestigious history of the region and includes forty models of the various machines designed by Leonardo. The museum also includes a copy of the Mona Lisa, painted in 1654 by Ambroise Dubois.[2]

Sydney In the search for love, the conventional wisdom would have us believe that playing hard to get is a winning move.
Indeed, previously in online dating, sending a simple "Like" was enough to allow singles to subtly express their interest, akin to admiring from afar but only ever making eye contact across the room.
But the online dating app Tinder has recently taken this to a whole new level with the release of a new feature called the "Super Like". By hitting the Super Like button, you are cutting to the chase, with Tinder's CEO and co-founder Sean Rad saying: "Super Like is more like going up to someone and saying 'hello'."
But is allowing people to be upfront and brazen online the best way to find true love?
The science of 'playing it cool'
Research suggests that when rating potential suitors online, women are particularly attracted to a man when they are 100% certain that he likes them back.
In psychology, this is known as reciprocity. Put simply, we like people who like us -- and by the same token, we should Super Like those who Super Like us, right?
Not necessarily.
This research has also found that when women are kept in the dark about whether or not a man is interested, they find him even more attractive. This is because uncertainty breeds rumination -- keeping your cards close to your chest increases how much people think about you and arouses their curiosity.
So while Tinder's Super Like was designed to help users avoid beating around the bush, according to the science, it may actually be better to hold back and appear more aloof.
But it can't be that simple, can it?
Hedging your bets
Arguably, another feature of online dating that attracts the time poor and forlorn is its accessibility and the abundance of choice. But research indicates that when inundated with options, such as hundreds of potential mates, we are less likely to commit and more likely to remain unsatisfied with our choices.
A recent study found that playing hard to get is only an effective strategy when there is mutual romantic interest and investment. But in online dating, the surplus of perceived choice generally makes people noncommittal, especially in the early stages.
Alternatively, declaring one's eagerness upfront can heighten feelings of romantic attraction, even if the target of our affections is not initially interested. So when dating online, it seems that sending a Super Like may be the way to go after all.
So when looking for a relationship online, do you Super Like or not? Well, the answer might also depend on who is making the first move.
To Super Like or not?
She who hesitates is lost
One commonly held belief in dating is that men should be upfront and make the first move, but according to research, the Super Like may actually be less effective for them.
The results from another recent study found that women are suspicious if a man is initially too keen. This is because women are more likely to interpret a man's over-enthusiasm as simply a strategy used for personal (usually sexual) gain.
On the other hand, in the first stages of dating, men generally prefer to be sure that they are in with a good chance. From a man's perspective, women who are clearly keen and responsive are seen to be more feminine, and therefore more attractive.
Based on this evidence, it is women who may benefit from being more forward and sending out a Super Like to initiate conversation online. In contrast, men should be more reticent and extra cautious when using the new function.

When looking for love online, bait with science
On the topic of courting, Mark Twain once wrote: "When you fish for love, bait with your heart, not with your brain."
Drawn from popular belief, baiting with your heart may not completely hurt your chances at love. Indeed, every year, thousands of people around the globe, do manage to find love online.
But online dating isn't always simply common sense. Understanding the science of attraction can further improve your chances. The question of whether to Super Like or not requires knowing how, when, where and why Cupid's arrow will hit or miss.
Vegetarian Nachos Recipe made in mini skillet. Quick, simple and very easy to make. Added mangoes to make it sweet and spicy. Ready in less than 30 minutes
Vegetarian Nachos is not an oxymoron!
Many of my meat eating friends have always mentioned that veggie burgers and veggie nachos don't have a place in this universe.
I have proved them wrong, time and again, yet, they refuse to accept it. Now, I am in the market for new friends, preferably vegetarian.
Here is a vegetarian nachos recipe that all meat eaters can get behind. The recipe is about comfort food and it is about Cinco de Mayo!
Years ago, the best vegetarian nachos I had were in a hole-in-the-wall restaurant in Manhattan. They put mangoes in their nachos and that blew my mind! They also had a Pico de Gallo made from pineapples and tomatoes.
Since then, I have been bitten by the Nachos Bug!
Side note – I also have a very different type of vegan nachos, in case you are interested.
For my blog, I wanted to pay homage to that hole-in-the-wall restaurant where I first fell in love with beans and cheese. What better time to pay homage to it than on Cinco de Mayo?
Yes, I can appreciate the underlying irony.
Nachos are an Americanized Mexican dish and Cinco de Mayo is an Americanized Mexican Holiday.
Regardless of its origins, I can't help getting caught up in the spirit of Cinco de Mayo.
Some days, I like to browse the clearance section of Target and get lucky once in a while. I found these tiny cast iron skillets for only $2!
SCORE!
They are perfect for individual vegetarian nachos. This will work great as an appetizer for my Cinco de Mayo guests and also have a portion control factor to them.
Add Margaritas and you have the formula for a great party.
Mangoes make this recipe. Guests are not expecting a layer of sweetness to go along with the spiciness of the nachos, but, they are delighted when they first bite into it.
If you don't have fresh mangoes, you can substitute Pineapples. Canned pineapple will work if you can't get fresh pineapple
If you are looking to make a healthy vegetarian nachos recipe, skip the cheese in my recipe and use low fat nachos. Also, you can use the Greek yogurt dip recipe from Food.com instead of the sour cream dip.
A while back, I had made 5 tomato salsa which would go GREAT with recipe. Prepare the recipe as described below and top it with the 5 tomato salsa or use it as a dip. You can also serve it with my apple salsa verde.
What is your favorite Cinco de Mayo dish?

Before the nation and the world, President Obama pledges to take “action” against “economic inequality,” while simultaneously holding secret negotiations on a Trans Pacific Partnership trade scheme that will quicken the pace of the global Race to the Bottom, deepening economic inequalities. “Lies of omission are even more despicable than the overt variety, because they hide.”
American State of the Union: A Festival of Lies
by BAR executive editor Glen Ford
“When you say ‘jobs,' he says tax cuts – just like the Republicans, only Obama first cites the pain of the unemployed, so that you know he cares.”
“Believe it,” said the current Prevaricator-in-Chief, in the conclusion to his annual litany lies. President Obama's specialty, honed to theatrical near-perfection over five disastrous years, is in crafting the sympathetic lie, designed to suspend disbelief among those targeted for oblivion, through displays of empathy for the victims. In contrast to the aggressive insults and bluster employed by Republican political actors, whose goal is to incite racist passions against the Other, the sympathetic Democratic liar disarms those who are about to be sacrificed by pretending to feel their pain.
Barack Obama, who has presided over the sharpest increases in economic inequality in U.S. history, adopts the persona of public advocate, reciting wrongs inflicted by unseen and unknown forces that have “deepened” the gap between the rich and the rest of us and “stalled” upward mobility. Having spent half a decade stuffing tens of trillions of dollars into the accounts of an ever shrinking gaggle of financial capitalists, Obama declares this to be “a year of action” in the opposite direction. “Believe it.” And if you do believe it, then crown him the Most Effective Liar of the young century.
Lies of omission are even more despicable than the overt variety, because they hide. The potentially most devastating Obama contribution to economic inequality is being crafted in secret by hundreds of corporate lobbyists and lawyers and their revolving-door counterparts in government. The Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, described as “NAFTA on steroids,” would accelerate the global Race to the Bottom that has made a wasteland of American manufacturing, plunging the working class into levels of poverty and insecurity without parallel in most people's lifetimes, and totally eviscerating the meager gains of three generations of African Americans. Yet, the closest Obama came to even an oblique allusion to his great crime-in-the-making, was to announce that “new trade partnerships with Europe and the Asia-Pacific will help [small businesses] create even more jobs. We need to work together on tools like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers, protect our environment and open new markets to new goods stamped ‘Made in the USA.'" Like NAFTA twenty years ago – only far bigger and more diabolically destructive – TPP will have the opposite effect, destroying millions more jobs and further deepening worker insecurity. The Trans Pacific Partnership expands the legal basis for global economic inequalities – which is why the negotiations are secret, and why the treaty's name could not be spoken in the State of the Union address. It is a lie of omission of global proportions. Give Obama his crown.
“The Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, described as ‘NAFTA on steroids,' would accelerate the global Race to the Bottom.”
The president who promised in his 2008 campaign to support a hike in the minimum wage to $9.50 by 2011, and then did nothing at all to make it happen, says this is the “year of action” when he'll move heaven and earth to get a $10.10 minimum. He will start, Obama told the Congress and the nation, by issuing “an executive order requiring federal contractors to pay their federally-funded employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour because if you cook our troops' meals or wash their dishes, you should not have to live in poverty.” Obama neglected to mention that only new hires – a small fraction, beginning with zero, of the two million federal contract workers – will get the wage boost; a huge and conscious lie of omission. The fact that the president does not even propose a gradual, mandated increase for the rest of the two million shows he has no intention of using his full powers to ameliorate taxpayer-financed poverty. We can also expect Obama to issue waivers to every firm that claims a hardship, as is always his practice.
What is Obama's jobs program? It is the same as laid out at last year's State of the Union, and elaborated on last summer: lower business taxes and higher business subsidies. When you say “jobs,” he says tax cuts – just like the Republicans, only Obama first cites the pain of the unemployed, so that you know he cares. “Both Democrats and Republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful, complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here, and reward companies that keep profits abroad. Let's flip that equation. Let's work together to close those loopholes, end those incentives to ship jobs overseas, and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs right here at home.” Actually, Obama wants to lower tax rates for all corporations to 28 percent, from 35 percent, as part of his ongoing quest for a Grand Bargain with Republicans. For Obama, the way to bring jobs back to the U.S. is to make American taxes and wages more “competitive” in the “global marketplace” – the Race to the Bottom.
In the final analysis, the sympathetic corporate Democrat and the arrogant corporate Republican offer only small variations on the same menu: ever increasing austerity. Obama bragged about reducing the deficit, never acknowledging that this has been accomplished on the backs of the poor, contributing mightily to economic inequality and social insecurity.
Obama offers nothing of substance, because he is not authorized by his corporate masters to do so. He takes his general orders from the same people as do the Republicans. That's why Obama only speaks of minimum wage hikes while Republicans are in power, rather than when his own party controlled both houses of Congress. Grand Bargains are preferred, because they are the result of consensus between the two corporate parties. In effect, the Grand Bargain is the distilled political will of Wall Street, which feeds the donkey and the elephant. Wall Street – the 1 percent – believes the world is theirs for the taking, and they want all of it. Given this overarching truth, Obama has no choice but to stage a festival of lies.
SAN JOSE — The Little League and East Side communities are mourning the death of a longtime volunteer, coach and mentor to thousands of San Jose youth, who was killed early Sunday in a confrontation as he worked as a security manager at a San Jose nightclub.

Frank Navarro, 35, was reportedly stabbed in an altercation involving a would-be patron who had been turned away after presenting a fake ID at the entry to Tres Gringos Cabo Cantina on South Second Street, according to a co-worker and family members. Navarro was rushed to a local hospital, where he died of his wounds.
The killing marks San Jose's sixth homicide of the year.
According to a law enforcement source, a vehicle seen fleeing the scene was stopped about seven miles west near Saratoga Avenue and Kiely Boulevard, and two people inside were detained in association with the deadly stabbing. Their involvement, if any, was not immediately clear Sunday morning.
San Jose police have not confirmed the coworker's and family's account, identified the victim nor described any suspects.

Navarro was president of Eastridge Little League, after years spent playing, coaching and volunteering. Hundreds of family members, friends and others gathered to mourn Navarro at a vigil Sunday night, filling the infield of an Eastridge ball field on Cunningham Avenue.
“He was one of the best coaches out here,” said Rudy Perez, 20. “He made sure we got our grades up. … He always made us do better, on and off the field.”
“Little League was his life,” said Navarro's girlfriend, Vera Covarrubias.
Rose Herrera, a former city vice mayor who knew Navarro through his work with kids' baseball and his coaching at Overfelt High, called the tragedy “a big loss for his family and for the community.”
Navarro grew up in East San Jose. At Overfelt, he was on the wrestling and football teams, playing a defensive lineman on a team that won the Central Coast Section championship.
He attended De Anza College, and worked in China teaching English. He also worked several years as a preschool classroom aide at Grant Elementary in San Jose Unified, and returned to Overfelt to coach varsity football and baseball.
“He was great with the kids,” Overfelt Principal Vito Chiala said. “He saw (athletics) as way to keep them engaged as they made their way through school.”
More recently, Navarro worked for a security contractor and also for at least 10 years in security for a company that owned downtown San Jose clubs, including VooDoo Lounge, San Jose Bar and Grill and Tres Gringos, Covarrubias said.
But his focus was on Little League.
His grandfather, Robert Delgado, was the longtime coach and board member of Eastridge Little League.
“He and grandpa were always side by side at the field working together,” said Navarro's uncle, Eric Velo, said. “He grew up through Little League.”
He became a coach, then a few years ago, he agreed to take over leadership of the Eastridge league when longtime President Jerry Soriano retired.
“It involved a lot of time for a young man his age,” Soriano said. A few years ago, Navarro set his mind to finding a way to repair a league field. “Our PeeWee field was being attacked by gophers and was basically unsafe to play on,” he said. Navarro pitched the league's case and won a free makeover from Oakland-based O.C. Jones and Sons through its TLC for Kids Ballparks program.
Navarro oversaw several levels of play, from T-ball through the majors and seniors divisions, developed special training for coaches, raised funds and umpired games. And he was thrilled that a change in Little League rules would allow him to also coach this year, Covarrubias said.
var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push(['embed']);
He was an avid San Francisco Giants and 49ers fan, and loved caps — he designed a new ball cap every year. “Our cars are overflowing with hats,” Covarrubias said.
Navarro was known as a jokester who loved to make people laugh.
“He was the goofiest guy,” Covarrubias said.
“He had a big heart,” said his uncle Mark Delgado, athletic director at Overfelt, echoing sentiments of others. “If you asked him to do something, he'd do it.”
Navarro was stepping in for a besieged employee Saturday night, when the club denied entry to a tattooed customer who allegedly presented someone else's ID, according to family members. The disgruntled man, accompanied by others, later returned and an altercation broke out. Navarro, as security manager was summoned, and was fatally stabbed. Police were summoned shortly after midnight.
His shocked family reflected on the irony that a man whose life was filled with kindness and who disliked confrontation ended up losing his life to violence.
“He loved everybody,” his step-father, Robert Delgado said. “He never liked drama.”
Besides Delgado, Navarro is survived by his mother Regina Delgado, his brother Michael Delgado, and his father Larry Navarro, all of San Jose; his brothers, Michael Joseph Delgado of Sacramento and Larry Navarro Jr. of Los Angeles; and his grandparents, Rosie Delgado and Lorenzo and Mary Navarro.
“He didn't have any biological kids of his own, but he had hundreds of kids from Eastridge Little League and Overfelt,” Velo said, “kids that he coached and mentored to keep them off the streets and have a chance in life to become good, productive adults.”
“Frank loved ‘his' kids, and never gave up on anyone,” wrote Sherri Greer, whose son Zachary used to coach and work with Navarro. And, she added, “he had a smile like no one else.”
“I'm still crying about it,” said Mauro Diaz, an Eastridge coach who had planned to meet Navarro at the league's field Sunday to get it prepared for the upcoming season's opening day. “It's just a big loss to our community, our baseball league and any kid who knew him. It's just a very tragic day for us.”

Following a new report from Human Rights Watch on the use of banned cluster bombs by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, the United States State Department has once again given a statement so the government may appear as if it is concerned. But there have been consistent cluster bomb reports since the U.S.-backed intervention was launched in March 2015, and each time business as usual has resumed with no regard for the civilians killed by these explosives.
On February 14, HRW reported, “Recently transferred U.S.-manufactured cluster munitions are being used in civilian areas contrary to U.S. export requirements and also appear to be failing to meet the reliability standard required for U.S. export of the weapons.”
According to field research by HRW, Amnesty International, and the United Nations, evidence has proven the Saudi-led coalition has used cluster munitions. The human rights groups have interviewed witnesses and victims of the cluster bombs.
Cluster bombs were used by Saudi-led forces on December 12, 2015. Muhammad Ahmad, who is 33 years-old, told HRW, “I was with six friends from the village … sitting on a small hill watching the strikes.”
“We suddenly saw about 20 white parachutes in the air, falling toward the port. Less than a minute later, each one released a cloud of black smoke as it neared the ground and exploded,” Ahmad recounted. “It looked like a series of multiple bombs all next to each other. Less than five minutes later, it happened again, another bomb let out a group of about 20 parachutes and the same thing happened. But because of the direction the wind was blowing, the parachutes suddenly started falling toward our village.”
Forty-two year-old Hussein Saed said the home of his brother, Ali, was hit by metal fragments. The fragments wounded Ali's wife, Aziza Ahmad Ahdab, a 42 year-old, and their daughter, Salama, who is four years-old. Ahdab had to have her lower right leg amputated.
In 2013, the U.S. government approved a deal to export $640 million worth of cluster bombs to Saudi Arabia by the end of 2015. The contract was with Textron Systems Corporation.
HRW claimed CBU-105 Sensor Fuzed Weapons were used in the December 12 attack. The group raised two key issues: one, the Saudi coalition launched these weapons in populated areas, which U.S. export law is supposed to prohibit. Two, U.S. export law only allows for cluster bombs with a “failure rate of less than 1 percent.” These weapons are not functioning reliably when launched in Yemen.
“The CBU-105 disperses 10 BLU-108 canisters that each release four submunitions the manufacturer calls ‘skeet' that are designed to sense, classify, and engage a target such as an armored vehicle,” HRW described, referencing a data sheet from Textron Systems Corporation. “The submunitions explode above the ground and project an explosively formed jet of metal and fragmentation downward. The skeet are equipped with electronic self-destruct and self-deactivation features.
“However, photographs taken by Human Rights Watch field investigators at one location and photographs received from another location show BLU-108 from separate attacks with their “skeets” or submunitions still attached. This shows a failure to function as intended as the submunitions failed to disperse from the canister, or were dispersed but did not explode,” HRW reported.
More significant than the malfunction of the cluster bombs, however, is the fact that the U.S. even permits, endorses, and defends the use of these explosives at all.
The U.S. government refuses to sign the Convention on Cluster Munitions and has actively pressured countries to not support the abolition of cluster bombs.
Diplomatic cables provided to WikiLeaks by U.S. Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning showed the lengths officials will go to fight bans against the weapons. For example, when Afghanistan was about to sign the treaty in 2011, U.S. diplomats argued destruction of stockpiles would “impede the ability of U.S. forces to defend” the country.
“We know from WikiLeaks and from U.S. officials that during the negotiating process that the U.S. contacted more than 100 countries to talk to them about the convention,” Steve Goose, who chairs the Cluster Munition Coalition, told The Washington Post. “The U.S. contact ranged from expressing concern to twisting arms not to be part of the process and not to sign—and they had a very concerted campaign to influence the language of the treaty.”
In addition to the December 12 attack, HRW reported on instances on April 17, April 27, and May 21, 2015, when cluster bombs were used. Amnesty reported cluster bombs were used on June 29. But reports, backed up by evidence, have not changed the manner in which government officials approach the issue of cluster bombs.
On January 7, State Department spokesperson John Kirby was pushed to answer whether the U.S. government would investigate the use of cluster bombs. Kirby tried to dodge the question, and then declared, “I know of no such investigation by the United States into the potential use of this particular weapon by the Saudi-led coalition.” That was not the question.
The use of cluster bombs was also referred to as the “alleged use,” even though it is abundantly clear the weapons have been used.
On December 29, 2015, State Department deputy spokesperson Mark Toner said, “I don't have anything here that conclusively points to or conclusively speaks to the use of cluster munitions. We have expressed these concerns, though, about their use in the past.”
A reporter pressed Kirby on September 9, 2015, on how cluster bombs were different than barrel bombs, because the U.S. government condemned the Syrian government for using barrel bombs that killed civilians.
QUESTION: Yeah, but in your description, it's not really that much different than cluster bombs, which, let's say, the Saudis are using in Yemen that are supplied by the United States. MR. KIRBY: Well, there's a huge difference, Said. I mean, cluster munitions are allowed legally when they are applied in a combat environment for discrete purposes. And when we transfer them or sell them, there is an end-use requirement there for how they're used, and certainly, we have vehicles at our disposal should they not be used appropriately. That's the big difference between the tactical, specific use of cluster munitions in accordance with international law and then dropping a barrel bomb out of an aircraft or a helicopter on a crowd of people. Big difference.
In other words, cluster bombs aren't bad because we have given their use a veneer of adherence to the rule of law. No amount of brutality will convince us cluster bombs are intended to kill and maim like barrel bombs. Plus, we use them and we do not have evil objectives like Bashar al-Assad.
When acting deputy State Department spokesperson Jeff Rathke was asked on May 4, 2015, “Would the U.S. bear any responsibility given that the alleged use of cluster munitions were supplied by the U.S.?”
“Well, we're looking into the specific allegations, so I don't have confirmation of those in the report,” Rathke replied.
Around eight months later, the State Department continues to act as if it is the sole responsibility of Saudi Arabia to account for the use of cluster bombs. But the U.S. cannot wash its hands of the blood being spilled as a result of deadly weapons exported to Saudi Arabia.
The State Department maintains the U.S. “spends more than any other country to eliminate the risk to civilians from land mines and all explosive remnants of war, including unexploded cluster munitions.” However, at no point has the State Department had anything to say about efforts to ensure Saudi Arabia cleans up unexploded cluster bombs. In fact, one can bet no such cleanup operations are underway as the carnage unfolds in Yemen.
Instead, the U.S. government clings to the notion that cluster bombs have some “military utility.”
“Their elimination from U.S. stockpiles would put the lives of its soldiers and those of its coalition partners at risk. Moreover, cluster munitions can often result in much less collateral damage than unitary weapons, such as a larger bomb or larger artillery shell would cause, if used for the same mission,” the State Department has claimed.
That basically translates to, be happy we are not defending the use of barrel bombs or other explosives more deadly than cluster bombs. Because we could be permitting the use of far worse weapons.
Hello youse,
Welcome to my first column of the year, and in time-honoured games website tradition I'll be using it to write a list of some sort. It will be a list, and it will be a list detailing my favourite games of 2011. I will even list them in order of preference, culminating in one itemised entry that I will declare the “winner”, in a sense. Indeed, I will call this column THE CARDBOARD CHILDREN GAME OF THE YEAR 2011, and invite you all read it.
I will invite you all to read it below.
INT. AWARDS CEREMONY THEATRE – NIGHT
A variety of big names in the board game industry walk up the red carpet.
We see REINER KNIZIA in a backless dress. He turns and smiles at the paparazzi, internally calculating the number of flashes from the cameras.
And there's PHIL EKLUND, over with the fans. He's on a fan's mobile phone, explaining the rules of High Frontier to the fan's baffled mother.
MUSIC IN:
VO: And here is your host! The star of Ironclad and Solomon Kane, available on Blu-Ray NOW! It's JAMES PUREFOY!!
JAMES PUREFOY enters, goes to the podium.
JAMES PUREFOY: Haha! Jesus, they actually have awards for these things now? Unbelievable. I'm only here for the first few minutes, don't worry. I have some ridiculously attractive 33 year old blonde London-based actress women to make love to. And, well, frankly it stinks in here. So let me announce your sub-host, the sub-human God of Games – Robert Florence!!!
ROBERT FLORENCE enters.
“Hello everyone, my name's Robert Florence, and welcome to my Game of the Year 2011. Tonight we will celebrate a truly remarkable year in gaming. The quality level was about as high as Fantasy Flight staff must be when they write those rulebooks.”
LAUGHTER.
“Seriously, Fantasy Flight's quality control really went downhill in 2011, huh? Can you believe that they released more apologetic press releases than they released expansions?”
LAUGHTER.
“Also, this year we saw lots of board games make the move to a release on iPhone and iPad. I'm sure playing around with some appropriate touching made a change for all you fucking creepy paedo board game weirdos, huh?”
AWKWARD SILENCE.
“Let's get on with the show!”
Two awards tonight, with the first one for EXPANSION of the year.
THE NOMINATIONS
Chaos in the Old World: The Horned Rat
Cosmic Conflict
Cyclades: Hades
Dust Tactics: Core Set
AND THE WINNER IS….
This was an easy choice for me. First of all, it has to be said that The Horned Rat was a great expansion. It allowed a fifth player and introduced a new god without totally fucking up the balance of the game. But here's what I've found – I prefer Chaos with four. I think four is the sweet spot, and a fifth player makes the game just a bit TOO stressful. It's still a fine achievement as expansions go. Cosmic Conflict added more brilliant content to a game that might be the greatest game of all time. Just keep expanding, and I'll keep buying. Dust Tactics: Core Set is not REALLY an expansion, but kinda is. It's a new starting point for my favourite tabletop dice-chucking battle game. I've already spoken about how much I love Dust: Tactics, so there's no surprise in its nomination here.
But then there is our winner – CYCLADES: HADES
Wow. I love Cyclades. I've never had one bad game of Cyclades. It's always tight, always fun, and always fast. Hades came along and kicked things up a gear by adding magical items, new monsters and a new god who lets you send undead warriors alongside your troops. It's the perfect example of a great expansion – it adds more variety and more fun, without increasing the complexity of the game. Cyclades is a beautiful, modern design and Hades is the cherry on the cake.
ALL HAIL HADES!
GAME OF THE YEAR 2011 – THE RUNNERS-UP
5. STAR TREK: FLEET CAPTAINS
Wow. Who saw this coming? A big Star Trek themed space exploration game, full of combat and secret missions and dice-chucking and cards. Complaints about the quality of the components seem insignificant when you consider what you have on the table – a theme-rich Star Trek game done right. A head-to-head exploration game that feels very simple and very deep. I've already covered this game, so please look back if it tickles your fancy. Here's a game that seems to have been designed for all the right reasons. “Wouldn't it be cool if this happened? Wouldn't this be amazing?!” A game with a lot of heart.
4. MERCHANTS & MARAUDERS
This is your pirate game. No question. You want to be a pirate? This is your game. In M&M you take command of a ship and do whatever you want. Do you want to trade goods between islands, and advance yourself as a lawful merchant? Do it. Do you want to listen for rumours in the island taverns and sail around as some kind of seafaring hero? Do it. Do you want to fuck up the plans of everyone else at the table by sinking them and all their worldly possessions to the ocean floor? Do it. This game allows players at the same table to play the game they want to play. Are you more of a Eurogamer? Do you prefer trading and building? Fine, be a merchant, grow your ship, and trade to your hearts content. Do you like chucking dice and blowing holes through things? Fine, be a pirate so you can hunt and be hunted. It's a fun, medium complexity game that is perfect for three players, and maybe runs a little bit long at four. This is your pirate game. This is it.
3. PRET-A-PORTER
Man, we love this game. Pret-A-Porter has you running your own fashion design business. It's a business game, an economy game, and this kind of games I usually avoid like the plague. But you all know that I love theme. If a game claims to have a certain theme, and I play that game and FEEL it, I'm going to give credit where it's due. Pret-A-Porter feels, don't laugh, exactly like running a fashion house.
You prepare collections for a number of fashion shows. At each show, different qualities will be most important. One might reward you for better PR, another might reward you for higher quality clothes, or another for being on trend. You have to build your business and your collections and choose which areas to focus on at which times. Want to court the journalists? Build a banquet hall so you can bribe them with food (Trust me- ask anyone at RPS – food works). Want to get more press coverage? Hire a superstar model. Do you need a short term contract with some TV channels? Fine, but you better have a negotiator to extend those contracts. Do you have all the materials you need to make that collection of evening wear? You better hire an accountant to balance the books before you see your credit advisor about an interest-free loan until after the next show. What? You don't HAVE a credit advisor? Oh dear.
This game is so sweet. It seems complex, but is really smooth once you have the rules down. The game has the same feel that something like Agricola has, where you can only do so much in a turn when you feel you need to do so much more. It's tense, exciting, brain-burning and it swings back and forth beautifully. In my last game, my girlfriend failed to bring a collection to the first show – a disaster. She ended up DESTROYING me by totally nailing the flow of the loan-repayment thing to develop her business into a self-manufacturing material house of DEATH.
Honestly, this game is being ignored because of the theme. The reason why we have so many trading, farming, fantasy and space games and so little variety of theme is because people shy away from games like this. Don't make that mistake.
2. ASCENDING EMPIRES
In a normal year, Ascending Empires would be the game of the year by a mile. But 2011 was no normal year. I've covered this space empire building and flicking game in an earlier column, but a few things need repeated. Ascending Empires gives you ALL the things you want from a space conquest game, and adds an extra layer that never fails with any player I've ever played with. “How do you move your ships? What? You flick them?!” And this game just moves at a ridiculous pace. Zero downtime, it flies around the table. Often you'll take your turn, take a sip of a drink and then someone will be nudging you to take your next turn. It's THAT fast. An unmissable, hilarious thing. A game that needs played at least once before you inevitably die.
1. KING OF TOKYO
This was tough. King of Tokyo was almost the game of the year. If the game of the year was measured by how many times a game has hit the table, KoT would be wearing the cardboard crown right now. This is another game I've covered before. It's a game that is perfect for any group, at any time, at any level of sobriety. It's Yahtzee with monsters and Cosmic Encounter style powers. There are very few games that you can recommend to everyone without any hesitation, but this is one of them. It's just a winner. Rolling big chunky green dice, storing energy and building up points, hitting your friends with a spray of acid from your throat. What else do you need from a game? This bad boy will be around for a loooooong time.
THE GAME OF THE YEAR 2011 – MAGE KNIGHT
Well. Here's a thing.
On any other website in the universe, Mage Knight might be a difficult game to explain. I'd probably be writing pages and pages, trying to explain how this game works and feels. But here, on RPS, it's easy. Mad easy.
Mage Knight is King's Bounty on a table.
I know you're probably ordering it already, but I'll keep typing anyway. In Mage Knight, you take a character on an adventure across the hexes of a modular map.
On this map you will find:-
– Keeps that you can conquer and control
– Monster Dens that you can “clean out”.
– Dungeons that you can explore.
– Mage Towers that you can conquer, to bend the wizards to your will.
– Villages where you can recruit help, or pillage like a bastard.
– Monasteries where you can learn new skills. Or you can burn them down like a bastard.
– Roaming bands of enemies you can defeat to increase your reputation
– Mines full of magical crystals.
– Cities you can assault and lead.
And MORE.
There's so much to do in this game. You won't even encounter all these things in every game, so every adventure takes a different shape. There are a number of scenarios for you to play through, each very different, and some of them co-operative. But what makes this game special is how you play it.
You do everything with cards. Each character has his own Deed Deck. It starts with 16 cards, and the cards allow you to do all the basic stuff your character needs. One card might give you 3 move points. One card might give you an attack of 2. From your hand of cards, you play a sequence of cards that let you carry out your plans for that turn. Every card can be played on its side for a basic value of 1. So, if you have no move cards in your hand, you can play an attack on its side for 1 movement. You can also use mana to power these cards, making the effects stronger. This mana comes from a central source everyone can use, or from crystals you've stored.
As your character develops, more cards will come into your deck. Here is where your mind will start to explode, and your leg will start to excitedly bounce. New skills come on cards. Spells come on cards. Artifacts you find are cards. And all of these come into your deck, and into your hand, and expand your options to a ridiculous extent. You can play a card to allow you to use extra magic from the source, which allows you to power another card which lets you turn magic of another colour into a crystal, which in turn lets you power an attack that can be charged by another card into an even STRONGER attack to defeat a FUCKING DRAGON.
Oh man. It IS hard to explain. I don't want you all thinking this is a deck-building game. It isn't. It takes the best aspects of deck-building games and adds it to an enormous fantasy adventure game. When you get hurt in Mage Knight, you take Wound cards. These get added to your deck. The more hurt you get, the greater the chance you'll draw a hand full of useless wound cards that let you do nothing. It's genius. Of course, there are abilities and powers that let you use Wounds too. There's everything in this game, a whole world in that box.
There's so much more to tell you. I want to tell you about the enemies that are fortified in those Keeps, and how the combat works. How you will play those cards to siege a castle wall, or play them in an amazing combo that turns an unassailable encounter into a cakewalk and you into a roaring fool. I want to tell you about the PvP battles, and how you can take an opponent's Keep from them. I want to tell you about how there's a Day/Night cycle that genuinely affects everything you do in the game. I want to tell you about how your character will level up, and how you will choose exactly how your character develops. I want to tell you about the troops you can command, and how they will die for you in battle with your enemies. And I want to tell you about how those same troops will refuse to help you burn down a monastery, because it's an evil act.
However much I've told you here, there is so much more in the box. I've probably forgotten all the cool stuff. Haha! Seriously! My God. Where do you start with this?
Mage Knight is a staggering game. It's one of those games you can only step back and admire as a thing of beauty, a work of art. The elegance of the card mechanics is matched only by the excitement they generate when you start to realise exactly how it all works. You are being given tools, and you are choosing how to use them. Many times you will play a hand of cards with a niggling feeling in the back of your head that you could have played them better, smarter. You're not rolling a die and hoping you hit an enemy in this game, you're rolling ideas around your head and hoping they land the right way up. A die won't defeat your enemies. YOU will. It's all in your hands. It's a masterpiece. I can't believe how good it is. Haha! Seriously!
And one more thing. It's also the magic ticket. What do I mean by that? Well, every time I do these columns, someone says they would love to try these games but they have no-one to play with. Read this next sentence…
MAGE KNIGHT IS AS GOOD WITH ONE PLAYER AS IT IS WITH TWO, THREE OR FOUR.
No lie. No bullshit. So here it is. Here is your solitaire fantasy board game, if you want it. The Game of the Year 2011, with no excuses not to try it. You know what to do.
You won't believe how good it is. Haha!
Abu Wa'el Dhiab, a 43-year old Syrian national, was among the six Guantanamo Bay prisoners freed last week and transferred to Uruguay after spending 13 years in U.S. detention. He had been cleared for release since 2009, yet the husband and father of three found himself imprisoned several years longer in circumstances characterized by indefinite detention, humiliation and inhumane treatment.
In response to what they saw as their increasingly desperate conditions, Dhiab and many other Guantanamo detainees repeatedly sought to employ the only means of resistance left available to them: refusing food. “We have given up the very things which are important: food and drink,” Dhiab stated last year, describing his motivations and those of his other hunger-striking prisoners. “And we have done so to get answers to our questions: What is our guilt and what is our crime?”
This past week, the Pentagon made the case for blocking the release of videos showing American soldiers force-feeding Dhiab and others, a painful practice that human rights organizations have decried as “cruel, inhuman and degrading.”
U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Sinclair Harris argued that releasing the tapes would only provide propaganda for hostile militant groups and further inflame popular opinion against the United States. In a seven page affidavit made public last week and first reported by the Miami Herald's Carol Rosenberg, Harris explained the reasoning for keeping the videos out of public view:
“While the videos at issue…do not in my opinion depict any improper treatment of the detainees, but rather the lawful, humane and appropriate interaction between guards and detainees, persons and entities hostile to the United States and its detention of enemy belligerents at Guantánamo Bay are likely to think otherwise.”
To put Harris's statement another way, the force-feeding videos are at once humane and appropriate, and yet also so visually appalling that people around the world would be enraged if allowed to view them. His solution to a potential backlash against U.S. policies is to circumscribe public oversight, and prevent anyone from actually seeing the treatment of detainees.
In the meantime, at Guantanamo, the videos of force feeding are likened to spectator sports. Rear Adm. Kyle Cozad, the camp commander, compares staff viewings of the force-feeding videos to “an NFL team watching video of the previous week's football game to determine what plays worked well, what they did wrong, and what they could do better during the next game.”
In fact, the force-feeding procedure involves violently shackling an unwilling prisoner into a chair and painfully forcing tubes into their body through their nasal cavity. Guantanamo prisoner Samir Naji al Hasan Moqbel described his own experience being force-fed in a rare New York Times op-ed:
“…a squad of eight military police officers in riot gear, burst in. They tied my hands and feet to the bed. They forcibly inserted an IV into my hand. I spent 26 hours in this state, tied to the bed. I will never forget the first time they passed the feeding tube up my nose. I can't describe how painful it is to be force-fed this way. As it was thrust in, it made me feel like throwing up. I wanted to vomit, but I couldn't. There was agony in my chest, throat and stomach. I had never experienced such pain before. I would not wish this cruel punishment upon anyone.”
Unlike Dhiab, who last week finally won his freedom, Moqbel remains incarcerated at Guantanamo with little prospect of release. While military officials may be able to casually characterize the force-feeding of such prisoners as some kind of innocuous guard-detainee interaction, they are correct that many others in the United States and around the world would likely not have the same reaction to such footage.
If people were able to see what is involved in the process of force-feeding prisoners like Dhiab and Moqbel, they may well be outraged and demand an immediate end to it, or demand a resolution to the legal quagmire of Guantanamo prisoners. This is why the world needs to see these videos.
If Admiral Harris and others believe that the actions they are carrying out at Guantanamo Bay are so shocking that they could galvanize public opinion against the United States, the solution is to either cease them, or allow the American public to watch and decide.

Jürgen Rolf Dieter Mossack (born 20 March 1948) is a German-born Panamanian lawyer and the co-founder of Mossack Fonseca, a former law firm headquartered in Panama City which had more than 40 offices worldwide.
Early life [ edit ]
Mossack was born in Fürth, Bavaria, Germany, on 20 March 1948.[2] His father, Erhard Mossack, was a Rottenführer (senior corporal) in the Waffen-SS, the armed wing of the Nazi Party's Schutzstaffel, during World War II. According to U.S. intelligence files, he offered to spy for the Americans after the war.[citation needed]
When Jürgen Mossack was 13 he moved with his father and the rest of his family to Panama.[3] Once in Panama Erhard Mossack offered his services to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for spying on Communist activity in Cuba.[4][5] Germany's Federal Intelligence Service, said in 2016, when contacted by journalists, that they had documents related to Erhard Mossack but would not share any information, owing to possible security risks.[6][7]
Mossack received a bachelor's degree in law from Universidad Católica Santa María La Antigua in 1973.[4][8]
Career [ edit ]
In 1975, Mossack worked as a lawyer in London before returning to Panama to start a firm in 1977. Mossack's practice only became Mossack Fonseca in 1986, when it merged with the firm run by Ramón Fonseca Mora, a Panamanian novelist, lawyer, and politician.[4][6] They built a global group of 600 employees and 46 subsidiaries, including the Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Jersey, Luxembourg, the US, specifically the states of Wyoming, Florida, and Nevada.
Mossack served on Conarex, Panama's council on foreign relations, from 2009 to 2014.[4][9] On 7 April 2016, he announced that given the leak he was resigning from Conarex, the national foreign relations council.[10][11]
His brother Peter Mossack has served as Honorary Consul of Panama in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, from 2010 to date.[12][13][14]
Mossack is a member of International Bar Association, the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners, the Panama Bar Association; the International Maritime Association; and the Maritime National Association.[8] Mossack's holdings, according to the files obtained by ICIJ, include a teak plantation and other real estate, an executive helicopter, a yacht named Rex Maris and a collection of gold coins.[4]
Investigations [ edit ]
On 3 April 2016, leaked documents from the company's private archive, dubbed the "Panama Papers", revealed detailed information on more than 214,000 offshore companies, including the identities of shareholders and directors. Mossack told the Wall Street Journal that the intermediary banks that his firm worked with — and who represent the final recipients of the shell companies — should have done better reviews of their clients: “Our brand needs to be protected. We feel the best way to protect the brand is by doing things ourselves and not rely on others.”[15]
News stories in May questioned whether the Panamanian consul in Frankfurt should be using the Panama@mossfon.com email address that he is.[16]
Mossack Fonseca was linked to a corruption investigation in Brazil into bribes paid to politicians by companies doing business with the state-run oil company, Petrobras. Investigators began focusing on the law firm after finding an array of apartments in the names of relatives of an imprisoned politician, the New York Times reported.[17] Mossack took a leave of absence from his position as a presidential advisor on March 11, 2016 after Spanish prosecutors requested information about corporations linked to Ignacio González as part of a money-laundering investigation in that country. He had held the office since President Juan Carlos Varela took office in 2014. He remained the acting president of the Panameñista Party.[18]
Personal life [ edit ]
Mossack has one son, Michael, and four daughters, Karin, Jennifer, Andrea, and Nicole. The latter two have been covered in the Panamanian press since at least 2003 for showjumping.[19][20] His daughter, Jennifer, worked in his firm and was point of connection for a lobbyist of the Center for Freedom and Prosperity.[21]
Mossack is a member of the prestigious Club Unión, where his daughter Nicole made her debut in 2008.[22] She is married to Tomás Altamirano.[23]

Pwning teh Midianites
1 Ceiling Cat was laik, moses2 pwn teh Midianites for teh j00s so tehy wil laik u.

Donald Trump has been in office for more than 100 days now. It's been more than half a year since Hillary Clinton lost what should have been the easiest slam dunk of her career. Democrats have not only not learned a thing, they seem content to double down on the same strategies that cost them the election in the first place, by continuing to insult the very voters that they needed to win over. Anyone who frequents Twitter can tell you this. I can point you to hundreds of “think pieces” that blame everyone but Hillary Clinton for losing the election.
A new and even more obnoxious trend has emerged in the post-election months. Liberals and so-called members of “the Resistance” seem more content to escape into fantasy rather than deal with reality. This trend manifests itself in two different, but not at all dissimilar ways. First off, there's pretending that Hillary Clinton is the president (the prime example being the @ifhillaryhad account), despite the glaring fact that the Clintons do not currently occupy the White House. The second is comparing our political situation to popular children's literature, like Harry Potter and The Hunger Games. Just take a look at this tweet from Joss Whedon, director of the Avengers movies:
We don't need a special prosecutor. We need an Auror. @jk_rowling — Joss Whedon (@joss) May 9, 2017
The issue with this tweet is that Aurors are fictional characters. As one Twitter user pointed out, special prosecutors have the advantage of actually existing. Trump is not Voldemort because Voldemort is a figment of British author J.K. Rowling's imagination. You would think that liberals who are really adamant that Trump should be investigated would be more excited about a special prosecutor, who can, you know, actually do something?
This type of thing wouldn't bother me so much if it wasn't so pervasive on social media. The other day, Slate tweeted out an article where they referred to Sally Yates as Katniss Everdeen from the Hunger Games series. I have no problem with drawing comparisons between literature and real life; that's part of the fun of enjoying literature, as well as why literature is written. The thing is that your comparisons have to be good. Donald Trump is not Voldemort or Sauron. He is an inept businessman who tripped over his d*ck and landed in the Oval Office. If you really want to compare Trump to a fictional villain, then you should compare him to Christian Grey of the Fifty Shades of Grey series, who is also a billionaire, a shitty businessman, and is abusive to women.
There are a few reasons why this is so infuriating. First of all, the same people calling Trump Voldemort are the same people who told Bernie supporters last year that wanting things like single-payer and free college was “pie in the sky” and “never ever going to happen.” Now, these same people are tweeting about what Hillary is doing on Earth 2 or something equally insipid. The other reason why this is irritating is that it's distracting as hell. We are living in a very tumultuous time, and most of you in #theResistance would rather live in a fantasy world where you're Harry Potter, or Hermione Granger, or f*cking Frodo Baggins, rather than deal with the very real challenges that we face. You have a chance to be real heroes by fighting for progressive policy. Go ahead, pretend that you're a protagonist in a children's book. I'll be over here fighting for real change.
A new era for solar power is approaching. Long derided as uneconomical, it is gaining ground as technologies improve and the cost of traditional energy sources rises.
Within three to seven years, unsubsidized solar power could cost no more to end customers in many markets, such as California and Italy, than electricity generated by fossil fuels or by renewable alternatives to solar. By 2020, global installed solar capacity could be 20 to 40 times its present level.
But make no mistake, the sector is still in its infancy. Even if all of the forecast growth occurs, solar energy will represent only about 3% to 6% of installed electricity generation capacity, or 1.5% to 3% of output in 2020. While solar power can certainly help to satisfy the desire for more electricity and lower carbon emissions, it is just one piece of the puzzle.
What's more, solar power faces challenges that are common in emerging sectors. Several technologies are competing to win the lowest-cost laurels, and it's not yet clear which is going to win. Rapid growth has created shortages and high margins for early players, such as the silicon refiners Dow Corning, REC Solar, and Wacker, as well as the component manufacturers First Solar, Q-Cells, and SunPower .
Fueled by ever-increasing flows of new equity from venture capital and private equity firms--$3.2 billion in 2007--innovative new competitors are entering the sector, and along with them, the potential for excess supply, falling prices and deteriorating financial performance for some time.
With competition heating up, the companies building the equipment that generates solar power must relentlessly cut their costs by improving the processes they use to manufacture solar cells, investing in research and development, and moving production to low-cost countries. At the same time, they must secure access to raw materials without tying themselves to the wrong technology or partner.
The evolution of technology looms large for utilities as well. If they hesitate to undertake large, long-term investments until the dust clears, they risk losing customers to players such as panel installers willing to put up and finance solar units on the roofs of buildings in return for a share of the savings the owners enjoy.
As always in the utility sector, it will be essential to deploy smart regulatory strategies, which in some regions might mean including solar investments in the capital base used to set rates for consumers. Government policies will also continue to heavily influence the sector's development. Deciding when and how to phase out subsidies will be critical for creating a vibrant, cost-competitive sector.
Even in the most favorable regions, solar power is still a few years away from true "grid parity"--the point when the price of solar electricity is on par with that of conventional sources of electricity on the power grid. The time frame is considerably longer in countries such as China and India, where electricity needs will require large amounts of new generating capacity in the years ahead and where cheap power from coal makes grid parity a more elusive goal.
The Birth Of A Sector
The solar sector includes a diverse set of players, including the manufacturers of the silicon wafers, panels and components used to generate much of today's solar power; the installers who put small-scale units on individual roofs; utilities and other operators setting up enormous solar collection systems in deserts; and start-up companies striving for breakthroughs such as lower-cost thin-film technologies.
All are operating in a dynamic environment in which long-held assumptions--subsidies, the primacy of incumbents and the predominance of silicon-wafer-based technology--are being eroded.
Beyond Subsidies
Government subsidies have played a prominent role in the growth of solar power. Producers of renewable energy in the U.S. receive tax credits, for example, and Germany requires electricity distributors to pay above-market rates for electricity generated from renewable sources. Without such policies, the high cost of generating solar power would prevent it from competing with electricity from traditional fossil-fuel sources in most regions.
But the sector's economics are changing. Over the last two decades, the cost of manufacturing and installing a photovoltaic solar-power system has decreased by about 20% with every doubling of installed capacity. The cost of generating electricity from conventional sources, by contrast, has been rising along with the price of natural gas, which heavily influences electricity prices in regions with large numbers of gas-fired power plants. These regions include California, the Northeast, and Texas (in the U.S.), as well as Italy, Japan, and Spain.
As a result, solar power has been creeping toward cost-competitiveness in some areas. California, for example, combines abundant sunshine with retail electricity prices that, partly as a result of the state's policies, are among the highest in the country--up to 36 cents per kilowatt-hour for residential users. Unsubsidized solar power also costs 36 cents per kilowatt-hour, but support from the California Solar Initiative cuts the price customers pay to 27 cents.
Rising natural-gas prices, state regulations aiming to limit greenhouse gas emissions and the need to build more power plants to keep up with growing demand could push the cost of conventional electricity higher.

ATTAWAPISKAT, ON – After a years-long housing crisis that has left the Attawapiskat First Nation with only 340 homes for its 2,100 residents and government inaction on both the provincial and federal level, community members have found a potential solution: applying for a position in the Prime Minister's Office.
“We sent our job applications in yesterday,” said Attawapiskat denizen Thomas Kebokee, who lives in a non-winterized shack. “I figured this was the quickest way to get the government to actually care about our housing situation.”
“The only downside will be having to live in Ottawa,” Kebokee added.
Fresh off a whirlwind U.S. tour where media described him as ‘beloved,' ‘liberalism's best hope' and ‘an even hotter Jesus Christ' Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would strongly consider the application.
“This is a population that is in desperate need. They need their land transfer taxes paid. They need to stay in a hotel for a few weeks while their house is decorated. They need ten or twenty thousand dollars just to have on hand, for, you know, whatever. I'm speaking, of course, of our most vulnerable senior aides and advisors.”
Principal Secretary Gerald Butts, who originally charged $126,669.56 in expenses to move to Ottawa, and Chief of Staff Katie Telford, who charged $80,382.55, echoed Trudeau's comments. “This government is committed to providing full and generous funding for housing to all Canadians,” said Telford, “as long as they happen to work for the Prime Minister.”
Kabokee has also asked the Prime Minister to send the community several thousand autographed photos, so they can use the paper as insulation.
Morsi states that he is moving to reduce the authority and influence of those loyal to former President Hosni Mubarak -- and that first the army and then the courts have been havens for protectors of the old regime's interests.
Is Morsi the kind of leader who will aggrandize total power and then liberalize like a George Washington or Abraham Lincoln? Or is he more like a Lee Kuan Yew who can build a state and the facade of a democratic system while holding tightly to power for decades in all ways that matter?
We don't know the answer yet. But for those surprised by Morsi's moves -- as the State Department reportedly was after having just secured his pivotal support on a Gaza-Israel truce -- only naivete would lead one to believe that a healthy, balanced, checks-and-balance democracy would immediately succeed the kind of autocracy Mubarak mastered.
Despite the claims in the media today that Egypt's judiciary was fairly independent and respected, the fact is that the system -- all parts of it, including the judiciary -- were ruthlessly managed and sculpted by forces that stewarded Mubarak's interests and power.
There were no checks and balances in Egypt during Mubarak; nor during de facto head of state General Mohamed Hussein Tantawi's short reign; and for the time being, there will be no checks and balances during Mohammed Morsi's tenure -- at least not in this phase.
Given the conditions of Egypt's rotten political culture that are turbulent and unstable, it seems ridiculous to think that an Egyptian leader -- whether religious or devoutly secular, whether a man or a woman -- would automatically and successfully move the Egyptian political architecture into one based on checks and balance statecraft.
This doesn't mean that the protests against Morsi in Tahrir Square are wrong or illegitimate. They are in fact vital in the absence of other political checks on Morsi. Note this excellent survey of the scene by David Rohde.
In a political system that has not been forged over decades and centuries of constitutional battle about the rights and prerogatives of branches of government, perhaps the people must rise in such a delicate time to empower other branches of government, while communicating what they believe to be the limits of Egyptian presidential powers. In other words, this conflict was inevitable: a new President whose party had been suborned and abused by the previous political order, mistrustful of institutions derived from that preceding era, is working to sweep aside those institutions and the people in them like any powerful executive would.
In a system of checks and balances, other parts of the political order rise to challenge the executive, vigorously defending their own turf and legitimacy. The people must allow both sides, or all three or four or five, sides in the institutional square-off to ultimately win, so that institutions are balanced each other not because they want to be but because there is no choice.
There's no such thing as "The Best College" only the "Best College for YOU".

STANFORD, Calif. -- Every i was dotted and every t was crossed, just they had been under Randy Hart's watch for 46 seasons.
Desk so clean you could eat off it? Check. Stanford defensive line in good shape? Check. Honest talent assessment? Check.
This time, he was evaluating himself, not his players. That's why he resigned last month as the Cardinal defensive line coach, left the game that has been his life since that November day in suburban Cleveland in 1965 when Woody Hayes made a recruiting visit to his house. Not just any November day -- Thanksgiving Day. With 45 minutes' warning. When the Harts had 28 people at their holiday table.
"That place was cleaned up," Hart said, "Twenty-eight people were grabbing their stuff and running out the door eating turkey wings. Woody Hayes is coming!"
Stanford will be without Hart for the first time in six years. This is a big loss for the Cardinal, which in those six years won 66 games and went to five New Year's Six bowls, three of them Rose Bowls. But that's not nearly as big a loss as the one suffered by college football, which is without Hart for the first time in 50 years.
Fifty years. Half a century. More than a third of the history of the entire sport.
Hart arrived at Ohio State as a freshman lineman in 1966, the year Joe Paterno became a head coach. When Hart graduated in 1970, Hayes made him a graduate assistant. Hart never wanted for a job again. Hart worked for only seven schools in 46 seasons. Four of his bosses are in the College Football Hall of Fame: Hayes, Earle Bruce, Jim Young and Don James. Hart participated in 10 Rose Bowls -- one as a player, nine as an assistant -- the second most in the history of the Granddaddy of Them All.
It is an accomplishment obscured by the anonymity of assistant coaching. Most athletic halls of fame don't recognize assistants -- historical snobbery on a grand scale. But if ever a coach should make the College Football HOF rethink its policy, it's Hart.
Hart could always see talent more clearly than other coaches. That's how, early in his 21-season tenure at Washington, he ended up with a two-star recruit named Steve Emtman. Hart turned him into the first player selected in the 1992 NFL Draft. At Stanford, he developed walk-on David Parry into the Colts' fifth-round pick last year. Parry started every game.
Hart loved the guys that Bear Bryant said had no talent and didn't know it. Hart pushed and pushed. That's why he never strayed from Saturdays.
"My style is not good for the NFL," he said. "I'd be locked in a locker. They'd kill me."
Five years ago, the late Chester McGlockton, the 12-year NFL defensive lineman, had just started an apprenticeship at Stanford when he died at age 42. Hart recalled how McGlockton watched him grind his defensive linemen, wearing them down and then demanding more.
"If I was playing for you, we'd have fought," McGlockton said.
"If you were playing for me, you'd still fricking be playing," Hart replied.
He laughs a lot. Hart's lack of narcissism in this Instagram world reflects his age, as do his expressions. He may have been the last coach in college football still saying, "Golly Ned!"
Hart summed up his coaching philosophy in a way that every athlete who ever had a demanding coach could understand.
"They play good, I'm going to rip their ass," Hart said. "They don't play good, I'm going to try to pump them up."
That strategy really worked well at Stanford, a campus that attracts students who demand a lot of themselves. Hart used to tease his players about their intellect.
"You're doing calculus, statistics," Hart would tell them. "You're over on the main part of campus solving world problems. And you can't find the A, B or C gap."
Or this:
"Men, understand one thing. We're not gonna argue who's going to have the lowest SAT in this building. Some day you're going to work for somebody without quite that test score that you've got. So it's a lesson in humility how to handle them. I'm in charge. You're working for me."

Last season, even as Stanford won its third Pac-12 championship in four seasons, Hart's eye for talent landed on someone whose effort didn't measure up to Hart's standards. Hart saw himself slipping.
"That's what you live by," he said. "I don't wear a beard. I've still got to shave every morning."
No one noticed. In fact, from the outside looking in, last season was one of Hart's best as a coach. Graduation and injuries left the Cardinal with four defensive linemen for most of the year. Tackle Aziz Shittu still made All-Pac-12.
"I've never not wanted to go on the practice field," Hart said. "And all of a sudden, that starts to get to be work."
When Stanford beat Notre Dame with a 45-yard field goal as time expired and sheer delirium erupted on the Cardinal sideline, Hart said he wasn't two steps onto the field before he thought, "Oh God, we got the championship game next week."
Hart retired because he read the actuarial tables. He really did.
"When you see, '68 years old,' and 'you've got 12.6 years to live,' there's a little bit of finality to that!" Hart said. "It's not good!"
He retired because he asked Earle Bruce, his lifelong mentor, for advice. Bruce, his position coach under Hayes at Ohio State, gave him his first full-time assistant job at Tampa in 1972. The $8,000 salary was $5,000 more than he had been getting from Hayes as a graduate assistant.
Bruce lost his wife five years ago. He told Hart, "I tell you what I'd do, if you could financially do it. You get out of it this year and you spend time with Linda. You spend time with your wife."
Hart can barely choke that story out.
He retired because of the 3:45 a.m. wake-up calls. Stanford must recruit nationally, because that's what it takes to find 25 talented guys with the grades necessary to gain admission. The defensive linemen that Hart brought in this year are from Fort Worth, Tampa, Indiana and Austria via suburban Chicago.
"Schools are open from 7 to 3, so you never travel then," Hart said. "There are no flights after the home visit, so that means you're going to fly early in the morning to get where you're going, which means a 6 [a.m.] flight. Which means a 3:45 get-up."
And he retired because he has four grandchildren under three years old in Seattle. He didn't see his two boys grow up.
"You haven't done anything in your life except work with somebody else's kids," Hart said. He listens to how that sounds. "Which is not a complaint. It's a lovely thing."
The feeling is mutual. When Hart retired, former Stanford defensive lineman Ben Gardner, another walk-on that Hart developed into an All-Pac-12 lineman, posted his love on Facebook.
"Coach Hart believed in me when nobody else did," Gardner wrote. "He gave me a shot as a 3-4 defensive end after a rocky freshman year, despite being 40 pounds undersized. He never let me use it as an excuse, coaching me as if I was just as big and strong as the next guy. Four years and countless grueling Randy Hart practices later, I was a three-time all-conference player, team captain and NFL draft pick. Coach Hart saw it well before I did and never let me sell myself short."
A Stanford player who never got the chance to play for Hart, 2016 signee Bo Peek, felt the same way.
"I will take everything you have taught me thus far and run with it," Peek wrote on Twitter. "I'll make you proud at Stanford."
The last time a college football season began without Randy Hart, the number-one single on the Billboard charts was "Help!," by the Beatles. The sport survived the loss of Knute Rockne, the Wing-T and Keith Jackson. It will survive the loss of one assistant coach.
But for all the attention that the Barry Switzers and Bobby Bowdens receive, the bedrock of the sport is men like Hart, who devoted their careers and sacrificed their family life to teach the young men in their charge.
Hart could no longer make that sacrifice. He and Linda have already returned to Seattle and to their grandchildren.
"They're not going to ever see me with a whistle," he said. "... I mean, who's going to have it better than me?"
Not college football.
Abraham Wald (; Hungarian: Wald Ábrahám; (1902-10-31)31 October 1902 – ( )13 December 1950) was a Hungarian mathematician who contributed to decision theory, geometry, and econometrics, and founded the field of statistical sequential analysis.[1] He spent his researching years at Columbia University.
Life and career [ edit ]
Photograph of Abraham Wald from the Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach.
Wald was born on 31 October 1902 in Cluj, in Transylvania in Austria–Hungary (now in Romania). A religious Jew, he did not attend school on Saturdays, as was required at the time by the Hungarian school system, and was thus home-schooled by his parents until college.[1] His parents were quite knowledgeable and competent as teachers.[2]
In 1928, he graduated in mathematics from the King Ferdinand I University.[3] In 1927, he entered graduate school at the University of Vienna, from which he graduated in 1931 with a Ph.D. in mathematics. His advisor there was Karl Menger.[1]
Despite Wald's brilliance, he could not obtain a university position, because of Austrian discrimination against Jews. However, Oskar Morgenstern created a position for Wald in economics. When the Nazis invaded Austria in 1938, the discrimination against Jews intensified. In particular, Wald and his family were persecuted as Jews. Wald was able to immigrate to the United States, at the invitation of the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics, to work on econometrics research.[1]
During World War II, Wald was a member of the Statistical Research Group (SRG) where he applied his statistical skills to various wartime problems. These included methods of sequential analysis and sampling inspection.[4] One of the problems that the SRG worked on was to examine the distribution of damage to aircraft to provide advice on how to minimize bomber losses to enemy fire. There was an inclination within the military to consider providing greater protection to parts that received more damage but Wald made the assumption that damage must be more uniformly distributed and that the aircraft that did return or show up in the samples were hit in the less vulnerable parts. Wald noted that the study only considered the aircraft that had survived their missions—the bombers that had been shot down were not present for the damage assessment. The holes in the returning aircraft, then, represented areas where a bomber could take damage and still return home safely. Wald proposed that the Navy instead reinforce the areas where the returning aircraft were unscathed, since those were the areas that, if hit, would cause the plane to be lost.[5][6] His work is considered seminal in the then-fledgling discipline of operational research.
Wald and his wife died when the Air India plane in which they were travelling crashed in the Nilgiri Mountains, in southern India, while on an extensive lecture tour at the invitation of the Indian government.[1] He had visited the Indian Statistical Institute at Calcutta and was to attend the Indian Science Congress at Bangalore in January. Their two children were back at home in the United States.[7]
Following his death, Wald was criticized by Sir Ronald A. Fisher FRS. Fisher attacked Wald for being a mathematician without scientific experience who had written an incompetent book on statistics. Fisher particularly criticized Wald's work on the design of experiments, alleging ignorance of the basic ideas of the subject, as set out by Fisher and Frank Yates.[8] Wald's work was defended by Jerzy Neyman in the following year. Neyman explained Wald's work, particularly with respect to the design of experiments.[9] Lucien Le Cam credits him in his own book, Asymptotic Methods in Statistical Decision Theory: "The ideas and techniques used reflect first and foremost the influence of Abraham Wald's writings".[10]
Abraham Wald was the father of noted American physicist Robert Wald.

The STEPS Foundation was founded by Ryan and Sara Hall to fight poverty around the world by improving health. And what better way is there to promote healthy living than by running? That's why, starting on May 9, 2015, I will be running across America in order to promote and raise money for their cause. This will entail running about 50k every day for 100 days from LA to Maine. Along the way I will try to talk to people I meet to spread the word of their charity and collect donations to support them. I have a goal of $10,000 by the time I finish on August 16, all of which will go straight to the STEPS Foundation. Please donate if you can or, if you can't, share this fundraiser with your friends, family, coworkers, and anyone else you know who would be interested. If you would like more info you can email me at barclayoudersluys@gmail.com or follow me on Twitter @ProjectGump for all kinds of fun stories from the run.
Thanks,
Barclay

A MAN impaled his head on wrought iron railings after tripping on a city centre street.
The victim is understood to have been walking along Dundas Street when he lost his footing and a spike went through his jaw.
Police and firefighters at the scene as a piece of the railing had to be removed. Picture: Kaye Nicolson
Firefighters had to use specialist hydraulic cutting gear to free the man before he was taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.
As the emergency services worked desperately to rescue him, a dentist from a nearby surgery dashed to the man's aid by delivering oxygen.
Despite his injuries, witnesses said that they saw the victim speaking to paramedics and Medic One fast responders who were treating him on the street.
One onlooker, who asked not to be named, said she initially thought the man was drunk and being restrained by police officers before she realised he was injured and they were holding him up. She said that a trickle of blood could be seen running down the man's neck.
The injured man was freed by rescuers and transferred to the ERI, where he is stable.” Police spokesman
Staff at a nearby business raised the alarm at around 4.20pm, after seeing the victim up against the railings, which are just under 5ft high.
Another passer-by said he could see a man up against the barriers, but it was not clear how he had ended up impaled.
The victim was taken to hospital as soon as he was freed, but the scene remained cordoned off for more than an hour after the incident. Firefighters from McDonald Road and a specialist unit from Newcraighall left the scene at 5.10pm, following a debriefing from the incident commander.
They could be seen hosing down equipment and ladders and removing bags of rubbish from around the cordon before standing down.
Two blood-stained cushions could be seen on the pavement, while a pool of blood was clearly visible underneath the barrier.
The three individual railings which were partially removed in the rescue operation were discarded on steps leading to a basement below.
Two police officers, one of whom was wearing latex gloves, stood guard at the cordon.
The dentist who had assisted the victim declined to comment. However, a member of staff at the Dundas Street surgery commended the emergency services for their swift response.
A spokeswoman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue service said that firefighters were mobilised following a request from police, who reported that the victim had been “impaled in the head”.
She said: “We assisted the ambulance service and Medic One in extricating the casualty from the railings. Hydraulic cutting gear was used and then the casualty was transferred.”
A spokesman for Police Scotland said: “Emergency services in Edinburgh responded to a report of concern for a man on Dundas Street at around 4.20pm. The injured man was freed by rescuers and transferred to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh where he is in a stable condition. There are no suspicious circumstances at this time.”

The Edmonton Eskimos got out of the gates, literally, ahead of the pack to open the 2017 Canadian Football League season.
Running back John White's 104 yards in Saturday's 30-27 win over the B.C. Lions was the biggest ground game registered on opening week.
“It's cool. It's cool for now,” said the five-foot-eight, 186-pound Utah product in his fifth CFL season. “Still, the beginning of things but I'm just taking it stride by stride and play by play like I should.”
Sometimes 43 yards at a time, like when he broke for a big gain that set up a 13-yard touchdown reception by Vidal Hazelton at the end of the third quarter to take a 20-11 lead.
“You're not worried about the big play or trying to make the big play,” White said. “I was just reading my keys and I prepare during the week so it should be easy during game time.”
He carried the ball 17 times for a 6.1-yard average, while earning one of just a handful of rushing touchdowns scored in Week 1.
Even when it wasn't always working before the big gain, the Eskimos kept putting the ball in White's hands to wear down the defence. At the same time, the passing game accounted for 315 of their 411 net yards of offence.
“We're just trying to find our identity as quick as we can in the beginning of the season and running the ball is going to be a part of that,” White said. “If we want to win the Grey Cup, we've got to be a balanced team and everybody knows that. We're going to see a lot of guys break out in the open over the next few games. You're going to hear some names that you haven't heard too many times.
“You've been hearing (Brandon) Zylstra and Duke (Williams) and they're going to continue to do well, but our offence is very high powered and we've got a lot of guys out here that cdan do a lot of damage.”
Ottawa-west?
The Ottawa RedBlacks flavour as the Eskimos opened the 2017 CFL season, while it's not exactly Ottawa-west, is certainly visible.
Besides former RedBlacks offensive co-ordinator Jason Maas becoming Eskimos head coach last season – a tie made even stronger with the addition of new general manager Brock Sunderland, who spent the past four seasons as assistant GM in Ottawa – the Eskimos have a trio of players off of last year's Grey Cup champion RedBlacks squad in running back Travon Van, defensive back Forrest Hightower and defensive end Mike Moore.
And that's not including other former RedBlacks like offensive lineman Colin Kelly and defensive half Brandyn Thompson. Defensive lineman Aston Whiteside had a chance to make it onto the list, as well, but couldn't cross the border to report for training camp.
OK, so it's not like there is enough former RedBlacks to make a locker-room push to change the Eskimos' name to the GreenGolds or anything.
“No, but when you talk about guys that are comfortable, the guys that are here right now from Ottawa I've had relationships with too,” Maas said. “And Brock obviously has relationships with them. Ottawa's been a very good football team the last two years, so anytime you can get guys that were in good systems come from a great organization that do it the right way, you know they're going to fit in here.
“Obviously, we're always looking for talent and it's just easier when you do know the guys and where they come from to feel good about it.”
Learning curve
Things are only going to get more intense for Nate Behar from here on out as the coaches look to evaluate the rookie receiver on short notice.
The first-round draft pick out of Carleton only arrived last Thursday and did some work on scout teams as the Eskimos prepared to open the season against the B.C. Lions.
“He wasn't in the plans to do much,” said Eskimos head coach Jason Maas. “(This) week will be a bigger week for him, bigger workload. We're just excited he's here.
“He was drafted at that spot in particular for a reason, we know he can play. It's just a matter of him fitting in, getting acclimated to the playbook, getting good with the locker-room and all that stuff. But I'm not really worried about Nate at all, I think he's going to do all those things.”

Environmental activists sent a message to President Donald Trump by breaking into his California golf course and carving a message into the pristine grounds.
Workers at Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes discovered the vandals' work Sunday morning.
The local ABC station spoke with the anonymous protest group, which had claimed responsibility for the vandalism.
"It's a protest piece against Trump's administration's handling of our environmental policies," the person said through a voice-disguising mechanism.
"He's been very aggressive in gutting a lot of the policies that we've had in place for a very long time. We felt it necessary to stand up and go take action against him," the person stated.
The words "NO MORE TIGERS, NO MORE WOODS," were etched with rakes into the green of the course's fifth hole.
Workers later covered up the message with tarps.
The new administration has angered environmental groups with its proposed cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and its stance on climate change.
Trump's first budget proposal includes a 25 percent cut to the EPA.
Meantime, new EPA administrator Scott Pruitt made headlines last week when he said in an interview that there is still "tremendous disagreement" on whether carbon dioxide emissions are responsible for climate change.

More than 25 years since its release, Sega's Mega Drive is expected to be a surprise hit this Christmas.
Nostalgic fans of the original console are flocking to buy the re-released machine, with sales having soared by more than 400 per cent in recent weeks.
Despite it not being as advanced as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, the £39.99 ($76) machines are flying off the shelves, according to retailer Argos.
Nostalgic fans of the original Sega Mega Drive are flocking to buy the re-released retro games machine that first went on sale in 1990. It may not be as advanced as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, but the £39.99 ($76) consoles are flying off the shelves, according to retailer Argos
The Sega Mega Drive introduced a generation to arcade-style games in their living room including the original Sonic the Hedgehog.
It was initially released in Japan in October 1988 and in America and Europe the following year.
Sales of Sega's console peaked in the mid-90s before the arrival of the first PlayStation created a new standard for video games.
GAMING CAFE OPENS IN HAMPSHIRE Last month, entrepreneur Steve Lowe opened the Game Over cafe in a cellar in Old Portsmouth. It took Mr Lowe 30 years to collect the consoles and seven months to make sure the location was secure. Working consoles available to play at the cafe include an original Sega Master System, a SNES, the ZX Spectrum and more recent models, including the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3. Games include the biking game Hang-On, Super Mario Bros and Fifa 96, and for people who preferred the arcade machines of the 1970s and 80s, Mr Lowe has installed two large screens with joysticks and controls.
It later went out of production but was reintroduced more than a year ago thanks to a growing fashion for retro products, from Sodastream to Spacehoppers.
The Sega console from Argos comes pre-loaded with 80 games include Sonic and Streets of Rage.
It is compatible with Sega Mega Drive cartridges and is sold with two wireless, battery-operated controllers.
Laura Hamblyn, gift buyer at Argos, said: 'There's a real appetite for nostalgia at the moment, whether it is firing up old consoles, or dusting down old vinyl records.
'The Sega Mega Drive is fondly remembered by the 90s generation who would spend hours helping Sonic The Hedgehog to defeat his arch nemesis Doctor Robotnik.
'It is fantastic to see parents buying this console to relive their childhood and introduce their own kids to some old school gaming.'
The release of the console is part of the rising trend of retro gaming.

James Bond is going back to his roots in "Skyfall". Major plot developments from the location work in Surrey this week...
Bond's Family Ancestry
13th March 2012
James Bond is going back to his roots in “Skyfall”. Click here to read the previous report from the location.
As MI6 reported at the weekend, 007 and M flee London to his home estate in Scotland, which is where the title of the film is taken. Whilst the main building, Skyfall Lodge, will be attacked (in a nice twist on the usual Bond film climax of the villain's base being destroyed), it is a small secondary building that will hold the most interest to fans.
Also on the Bond family's estate is a small chapel and a grave site for his parents Andrew Bond and Monique Delacroix who died in a climbing accident when he was a child. This literary back-story has been mentioned in passing by films before, specifically “GoldenEye”, but this will be the first time that the topic is faced head on by the character.
Construction on the buildings was completed yesterday in a hive of activity, with location filming scheduled for today with Daniel Craig. As the Foraging Photographer reports, even fake dead trees and artificial snow was used to dress the location to match shots filmed in Glencoe earlier this year.
Names on the Bond family gravestones include Robert Bond, Celia Bond, Valentine Bond, Kathleen Bond, and his parents Andrew Bond and Monique Delacroix Bond. The latter stone is marked “tragically departed” with the latin phrase “Mors Ultima Linea Rerum Est” (Death is Everything's Final Limit).
Visit The Foraging Photographer's blog for more photos and reports from the "Skyfall" set in Hankley Common.
In the midst of the Toronto Spring in early 2012, TTC chair Karen Stintz posed a question to me that has stuck in my mind ever since: “How do we know we've made a decision?” she wondered as her faction on council fought valiantly to reverse the ridiculous course set by Mayor Rob Ford when he decreed, on his first day in office, that Metrolinx down tools on the $8.7 billion transit plan approved by the McGuinty government in early 2010.
As history and the council record will show, the Stintz 26 ultimately prevailed, with Metrolinx and the City finally signing a deal last year for the four major projects. Council and the public debated the phony subway/LRT dichotomy every which way to Malvern, and then a decision was made.
Why Stintz and others insist on endlessly re-litigating that decision — by pushing to extend the Bloor-Danforth subway to Scarborough Town Centre instead of replacing the RT with an LRT — is not merely a mystery. It also throws her leadership judgment into question, largely because she's now leading a group that is committing precisely the same sin as Ford did in 2010.
In a craven and deeply ironic bid to win votes in Scarborough next year, both sides are agitating to re-open the Metrolinx agreement, thereby creating more years of delay and forcing untold additional costs onto future taxpayers.
It's unseemly, dishonest, fiscally irresponsible, and disappointing. Stop.
There's a second dimension to this regrettable gambit that rarely gets discussed, and that is the opportunity cost associated with the incremental outlay for the subway extension (which is either $925 million or $500 million, depending on whom you believe).
Set aside, for a moment, the reality that council hasn't identified the funding source, and seems unlikely to commit itself to the funding. My question is, what is the return on investment for the extra funding required to upgrade the line from an LRT to a subway? Will this change in plan produce more economic activity in that corridor? Will council approve more development that wasn't heading towards those stops already? And besides the infrastructure spend itself, are there going to be other spin-offs that wouldn't have been forthcoming with an LRT?
I don't know the answers to those questions, as I don't think they've been seriously discussed. But let's shift our gaze slightly to look at what that $500 million could deliver in terms of return on investment elsewhere in the city.
As it happens, that figure is approximately the amount Waterfront Toronto needs to rebuild the mouth of the Don River in the Portlands. For those who haven't been paying attention, provincial environmental regulations prohibit development in the lower Donlands and the Portlands until the City creates suitable floodplain protection in the area.
We've all seen what high waters did to downtown Calgary in the past week-and-a-half, so the need for such infrastructure is anything but theoretical. Waterfront Toronto's plan is to build two new naturalized channels through the Portlands, both of which will provide the required floodplains and park and recreational space.
Once they're constructed, the rest of the Portlands can be redeveloped. But Waterfront Toronto officials point out that funding has yet to be identified.
What's the return on investment? Consider that the flood protection berm under the newly opened Corktown Common, which cost $135 million, unlocked over $1 billion in public and private investment in the West Donlands vicinity (the area sits in the Don floodplain). That's $8 in for every $1 spent. Not a bad profit.
The Portlands is a far larger and more desirable canvas, with better access to the lake, so it's reasonable to assume that the City will earn back that $450 million investment many times over, with billions in new construction projects and thousands of jobs for residential, office, tourist, commercial and recreational uses.
Do we get the same kind of payback by spending the same sum on a subway that will run through an industrial corridor that doesn't really lend itself to high density development in the first place? I think not.
My point is that if council, for the worst political reasons, believes it can find another $500 million from spending reallocations or taxes, perhaps we should first figure out where we'll get the most economic bang for those hard-earned dollars.
I'd predict that in a disinterested side-by-side analysis with the Portlands flood plain project, that undead Scarborough subway would never leave the station. bottom

The Russian Defence Ministry on Sunday denied reports about an alleged killing of five Russian servicemen in a car explosion on the road to Al-Raqqa in Syria, Russia's Interfax reported.
“The reports of the Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera about the alleged deaths of Russian servicemen in Syria are yet another disinformation… All Russian soldiers in the Syrian Arab Republic are safe and sound and fulfilling their duties”, the spokesman of the Russian Defence Ministry Major General Igor Konashenkov said. He expressed regret over the broadcaster's “spreading fake news”.
According to sources close to the Syrian authorities, a Russian military vehicle carrying ammunition, exploded on Saturday night on the road between the cities of Jableh and Baniyas, leading to the death of five Russian military servicemen.

The sources added that the incident was the result of technical problems, excluding the possibility of a terrorist attack. According to them, the Syrian military has cordoned off the scene and together with the representatives of Russia are investigating the incident.
Since 2011, Syria has been engulfed in a war, with government forces fighting against numerous opposition and terrorist groups, including Al-Nusra Front and Daesh, banned in a range of countries, including Russia.
Russia has been conducting a counter-terrorist campaign in Syria since September 30, 2015, at President Bashar Assad's request.
Last year, the Russian army's air forces announced incurring significant losses in the fight.

On October 26, the United Nations-Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM)—an independent, technical body established by unanimous vote of the UN Security Council—released its most recent report on chemical weapons use in Syria. The experts of the JIM concluded with confidence that the Assad regime used the chemical weapon sarin on April 4, 2017, in Khan Shaykhun, killing more than 100 of its citizens, many of whom were children and women. This unconscionable attack marks the fourth time that the JIM has confirmed that the Assad regime used chemical weapons, underscoring the brutal and horrifying barbarism of Bashar al-Assad and making the protection provided by Russia even more egregious. Russia's attempts to undermine and eliminate the JIM show a callous disregard for the suffering and loss of life caused by the use of chemical weapons and an utter lack of respect for international norms.
All those who use chemical weapons must be held accountable. The United States implores the UN Security Council to renew the mandate of the JIM so that we may continue to identify the perpetrators of these horrific attacks and send a clear message that the use of chemical weapons will not be tolerated. Countries that fail to support the work of the independent investigators stand in direct opposition of all standards of reasonable international conduct. Especially in light of the recent findings, all countries should understand the importance of the JIM's work and that it is critical that such work continue. Our collective standards for human decency make it imperative that we do all in our power to deter such use of chemical weapons in the future.
